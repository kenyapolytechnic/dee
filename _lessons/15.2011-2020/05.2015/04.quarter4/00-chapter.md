Mi-Yittan

B                iblical Hebrew, like most languages, is sprinkled with idioms, words,
                 or phrases that mean something different from what they immedi-
                 ately say. An example is mi-yittan, which is composed of two Hebrew
words: mi, which is the interrogative “who?”; and yittan, which means “will give.”
Thus, we have “who will give?”
   In the Hebrew Bible, this phrase expresses the idea of a wish, of a desire, of someone
wanting something badly. For instance, after their escape from Egypt, the children
of Israel, facing challenges in the wilderness, exclaimed, “ ‘If only we had died by the
Lord’s hand in Egypt!’ ” (Exod. 16:3, NIV). The phrase “if only” came from mi-yittan.
In Psalm 14:7, David utters, “Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion!”
The Hebrew doesn’t say, “Oh”; it says, mi-yittan. In Job 6:8, when Job exclaims, “ ‘Oh,
that I might have my request’ ” (NIV), “Oh” is from mi-yittan.
   Another occurrence appears, this time in Deuteronomy 5:29. Going over the history
of God’s providences, Moses reminds the children of Israel about their request that he,
Moses, talk to the Lord for them, lest they die. According to Moses, the Lord, pleased
with their request, then said: “Oh, that they had such a heart in them that they would
hear Me and always keep all My commandments” (NKJV).
   The word translated “Oh”? Yes, it is mi-yittan.
   Incredible! Here is the Lord—the Creator God, the One who made space, time,
and matter, the One who spoke our world into existence, the One who breathed into


2
Adam the breath of life—uttering a phrase generally associated with the weaknesses
and limitations of humanity.
   Talk about the reality of free will. Talk about the limits of what God can do in
the midst of the great controversy. This use of mi-yittan reveals that even God won’t
trample on free will (because the moment He did, it
would no longer be free).
   Now, if ever one book of the Old Testament revealed The book of Jeremiah
the reality of God’s desire for humans to obey Him, recounts the ministry
and the human tendency not to, it would be the book and message of the
of Jeremiah, the topic of this quarter. Set against the
                                                                prophet as he, with
background of great geopolitical changes in the ancient
Near East, the book of Jeremiah recounts the ministry passion and faithful-

catch the essence of so much of what the Lord seeks from His people: “Thus says the
Lord: ‘Let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast in his

majesty of the Lord—the Lord who, from those heights, cries out to all of us: Mi-yittan
that such a heart would be in you!

      The Prophetic Calling
      of Jeremiah




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Isa. 1:19, Jer. 7:5–7, 1 Kings
      2:26, Jer. 1:1–5, Isa. 6:5, Jer. 1:6–19, Matt. 28:20.

Memory Text: “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; before
      you were born I sanctified you; I ordained you a prophet to the
      nations” (Jeremiah 1:5, NKJV).



      W
                 e know more about the life of Jeremiah than we do about
                 any other Old Testament prophet. The biographical facts in
                 his book help us understand better his work as a prophet.
      Jeremiah had such an effect on history that, even at the time of Jesus,
      he was a revered prophetic figure.
        At the same time, the prophet’s work, judged by human standards,
      shows only slight success. Despite decades of fervent warning and
      pleadings, the people for the most part didn’t listen to the messages he
      gave them from the Lord.
        Nevertheless, despite the opposition, Jeremiah could not be bought
      or sold; he stood as “a fortified city, an iron pillar and a bronze wall”
      (Jer. 1:18, NIV), not in his own strength but in the Lord’s.
        Jeremiah’s lot in life wasn’t a happy one in many ways. His calling
      brought him suffering, woe, rejection, even imprisonment. Worse still
      was the fact that so many of these troubles came from the very ones
      whom he was seeking to help, seeking to point in the right direction.
      Thus, in his own way, Jeremiah prefigured what Jesus Himself would
      face hundreds of years later in the same land.

     The Prophets
       The prophets, according to their calling, were determined protectors
     of God’s law. They stood on the ground of the covenant and the Ten
     Commandments (Jer. 11:2–6). Micah 3:8 gives one summary of the
     prophets’ work, which was “to declare unto Jacob his transgression,
     and to Israel his sin.” And the concept of sin, of course, is meaningless
     apart from the law (see Rom. 7:7).

What was the prophets’ message to the people? In what ways is that
     message the same to us today? Isa. 1:19, Jer. 7:5–7, Ezek. 18:23. (See
     also Matt. 3:7–11.)

       God’s judgment was not inevitable, but it would come if the people
     did not turn from their evil ways. Change, however, is not so easy, espe-
     cially when people get accustomed to doing evil. Who hasn’t seen how
     people get used to the evil that, at one time, had appalled them? The
     message of the prophets was to let people see just how bad their evil
     was and what the consequences were of not turning away from it. This
     message, of course, wasn’t the prophets’; it was the Lord’s.
       The prophets do not mention how God’s Word was revealed to them
     or how they heard it. At times God spoke to them directly; other times
     the Holy Spirit touched them in dreams or visions or, perhaps, through
     a “still small voice” (1 Kings 19:12). However their messages came
     to them, the prophets had a mission, not only to transmit God’s will
     to the common people but also, if need be, to deliver it before kings,
     emperors, and generals.
       This task involved great responsibility: if they told the truth, these
     powerful people could kill them; but if they did not represent the truth,
     God’s judgment could also come upon them. To be a prophet is a heavy
     calling, and from what we can tell from the Bible, those given that call
     took it seriously.
       We can be glad they did, for their messages have come down to us in
     the Bible. In that sense, their words still speak, even today. The question
     now, as in Jeremiah’s time, is the same: Will we listen?

      What are the prophets, even after all this time, still telling us? At
      the core, what is their basic message to God’s people?



                                                                              7

     Jeremiah’s Family Background
Read 1 Kings 1 and 1 Kings 2:26. What was the background that led
     to the exile of Abiathar to his home in Anathoth?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        After he strengthened his throne, Solomon, in a conflict with
     Adonijah over succession, removed Abiathar the priest from his
     office and sent him into exile back to his hometown, Anathoth,
     believed to be about three miles northeast of Jerusalem. Hilkiah,
     Jeremiah’s father, was a member of a priestly family that lived at
     Anathoth. Some have speculated that Jeremiah’s family may have
     descended from Abiathar. Either way, we know from Jeremiah
     1:1 that the prophet had an exalted lineage. Thus, we can see here
     that all through prophetic history the Lord has called all types of
     people—shepherds, rabbis, fishermen, priests—to the prophetic
     office.
        “A member of the Levitical priesthood, Jeremiah had been trained
     from childhood for holy service. In those happy years of prepara-
     tion he little realized that he had been ordained from birth to be ‘a
     prophet unto the nations;’ and when the divine call came, he was
     overwhelmed with a sense of his unworthiness. ‘Ah, Lord God!’ he
     exclaimed, ‘behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.’ Jeremiah 1:5,
     6.”—Ellen G. White, Prophets and Kings, p. 407.
        The priests were to be the moral and spiritual leaders of the
     nation; they had been given important roles that impacted most
     every area of the nation’s spiritual life. Some had been faithful to
     that task; others abused and violated it in ways that we can’t imag-
     ine. As we will soon read in the book of Jeremiah, the prophet had
     very strong words to speak against these unfaithful priests, who had
     proved unworthy of the responsibilities and calling that they had
     been entrusted with.

      What are your spiritual responsibilities, whether at home or in
      the church or both or anywhere else? If a prophet were to speak
      to you now about those responsibilities, what might he or she say?
                                                                        _

     The Prophetic Calling of Jeremiah
Read Jeremiah 1:1–5. What does this tell us about Jeremiah’s calling?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Just like other prophets in the Old Testament (and like Paul in the
     New; see Gal. 1:1, Rom. 1:1), Jeremiah didn’t waffle in regard to who
     called him. He was very clear in these verses and, in fact, all through
     the book of Jeremiah, that what he was speaking was “the word of the
     Lord,” which had come to him. No doubt this fervent conviction is
     what enabled him to press on ahead despite vehement opposition and
     toil, suffering, and trials.
       Jeremiah’s calling happened in the thirteenth year of the reign of
     Josiah, dated to about 627 or 626 b.c. We do not know the exact year the
     prophet was born, or the exact age he began his ministry. In his mind,
     though, as we will see, he deemed himself a child, someone too young
     for the task given him.

Read Jeremiah 1:4, 5. What assurance and comfort should he have
      gotten from those words?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       God chose Jeremiah to be a prophet before his birth. God set him
     aside from the moment of his conception for this prophetic role. The
     words translated “I sanctified you” (vs. 5, NKJV) come from a verb that
     means “to be hallowed,” “to be holy,” and to “sanctify,” among other
     things. It definitely has a sacred and religious connotation to it, one tied
     also with the sanctuary service itself. Indeed, the word for “sanctuary”
     comes from the same root word. The idea contained in it is that some-
     thing or someone is “set apart for a holy purpose.” This is what God had
     planned for Jeremiah, even before his birth. These texts don’t teach pre-
     existence or predestination; they teach, instead, God’s foreknowledge.

      God knows the end from the beginning. What comfort can we
      draw from this amid the trials that we inevitably face?
                                                                               _

     Reluctant Prophets
       Despite the Lord’s assurance that Jeremiah had been divinely chosen
     for this task, the young man was frightened and didn’t feel up to it.
     Perhaps knowing the spiritual state of people at the time, which wasn’t
     good, and knowing what needed to be done, Jeremiah didn’t want the
     job.

Compare Jeremiah 1:6 with Isaiah 6:5 and Exodus 4:10–15. What
     common points do all these incidents have?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       None of those men, for whatever reasons, felt up to the task.
     Perhaps that was a crucial prerequisite for the job of a prophet: a
     sense of one’s own unworthiness and inability for such a crucial and
     important task. A spokesman for the Creator? No wonder they all
     shrank from the task, at least at first.
       Notice Jeremiah’s first response after being called. He immedi-
     ately talked about his inability to speak well, as did Moses. Isaiah,
     too, in his response, made mention of his mouth, his lips. In all
     cases, they knew that, whatever else their calling involved, it would
     involve speaking and communication. They were going to get mes-
     sages from God and, as such, would be responsible for proclaiming
     those messages to others. Unlike today, where they could build a
     Web site or send a text message, this communication would so often
     have to be face to face. Imagine having to stand before hostile lead-
     ers or unruly people and give them sharp words of rebuke and warn-
     ing. The reluctance of these soon-to-be prophets is understandable.

      Read Jeremiah 1:7–10. What is God’s response to Jeremiah?
      Why should that response hold some hope and promise for us
      in whatever we believe we have been called by God to do?
                                                                          _

      The Almond Branch
         The prophet is God’s witness; his job is to speak not for himself but
      for God alone. Jeremiah wasn’t called to find solutions to the problems
      of the nation or to become a great personality or charismatic leader
      whom the people would follow. Jeremiah had the singular mission to
      transmit the words of God to the people and their leaders. The empha-
      sis here is not on the human or on human potential; it is on God’s
      sovereignty and power alone. The prophet was to point the people to
      the Lord, in whom alone was the solution to all their problems. It is, of
      course, no different for us today.

What was Jeremiah’s first vision about? (See Jer. 1:11–19.)
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        Most Bible translations translate the Hebrew expression in verse 11
      as “the branch of an almond tree.” These translations, however, miss the
      Hebrew play on words here. The word translated “almond tree” has the
      same root as the verb “to keep watch,” which appears in verse 12, when
      the Lord says that He is going to “keep watch” over His word to fulfill it.
        One could argue that the central message of the entire book of
      Jeremiah is found in verses 11 and 12. God’s word will be fulfilled. One
      day everyone will see events happen just as God said they would. God
      wants His people to turn away from their sins. He has offered grace and
      forgiveness, but He does not force anyone to obey and be healed. If His
      people will not respond to Him, His words of judgment and punishment
      will certainly be fulfilled as His words against Israel were fulfilled in
      the book of Jeremiah.
        As we can see, too, God’s words here were not just for the people.
      The Lord was speaking directly to Jeremiah himself, warning him to
      be prepared for the opposition that he would face. No matter what
      happened, Jeremiah could have the assurance from God that “I am
      with you.” He would, as we will see, need it.
        Don’t we all?

       Read Matthew 28:20. What assurance can we find for ourselves
       in these words to us, living in the time that we do?
                                                                               _

                                                                              11
                 F riday October 2

Further Thought: Martin Luther wrote about the prophet in the intro-
     duction of his commentary to the book of Jeremiah: “Jeremiah was a sad
     prophet, who lived in a deplorable and difficult period and, what is more,
     his prophetic service was extremely difficult as he was struggling and
     fighting with a bad-tempered and stubborn people. Apparently he did not
     achieve much success because he experienced how his enemies became
     more and more evil. They tried to kill the prophet several times. They
     pressed hard against him, whipping him several times. Yet, he would live
     to see with his own eyes how his country was devastated and his people
     taken into exile.”
        “For forty years Jeremiah was to stand before the nation as a witness
     for truth and righteousness. In a time of unparalleled apostasy he was
     to exemplify in life and character the worship of the only true God.
     During the terrible sieges of Jerusalem he was to be the mouthpiece
     of Jehovah. He was to predict the downfall of the house of David and
     the destruction of the beautiful temple built by Solomon. And when
     imprisoned because of his fearless utterances, he was still to speak
     plainly against sin in high places. Despised, hated, rejected of men, he
     was finally to witness the literal fulfillment of his own prophecies of
     impending doom, and share in the sorrow and woe that should follow
     the destruction of the fated city.”—Ellen G. White, Prophets and Kings,
     p. 408.


Discussion Question:
       One of the saddest things, and yet something that should give
      us all, today, as Seventh-day Adventists, something to think about,
      is the fact that God had warned Jeremiah that he would face great
      opposition from his own people. Read Jeremiah 1:17–19 again.
      Who would be the ones fighting against him? What fearful les-
      son should we take away from this for ourselves? That is, what is
      our attitude toward the prophetic word to us, especially when we
      hear things that we don’t like? How does the Ellen G. White quote
      above help express the fearful truth that the very ones who should
      have been revealing the true God to the world were the ones who
      were, by reviling and attacking His spokesman, fighting against
      Him? (See also Eccles. 1:9.)

A Most Satisfying Career: Part 1
   Harry and Alex* worked as security guards in Malawi. One night Alex told
Harry that he had an idea of how they could earn some extra money.
   “What’s that?” Harry asked, interested.
   “We could use our rifles in a little side business,” Alex said, lifting his gun.
“Rich people have more than they need, and we need more than we get. We could
take a little from them so we can have enough for ourselves.”
   Harry wasn’t sure; but eventually, he was convinced. The two broke into the
home of a wealthy family and stole cash and anything they could carry. A few
days later, they robbed more homes. But one night they were caught. Sitting in
jail, Harry realized the seriousness of his crimes. The two men were sentenced to
eight years of hard labor in separate maximum security prisons.
   Harry arrived at the prison determined to escape. His prison shirt was
imprinted with the length of his prison term. One day Harry bribed another
prisoner to trade shirts.
   When he wore his new shirt with a sooner release date, he was assigned to a
low-security job in the prison garden. Harry noticed that the armed guard watch-
ing them grew sleepy every afternoon. One day when the guard was yawning,
Harry dropped his hoe and ran. Other prisoners started running too.
   The guards caught all the prisoners except Harry, who had hidden among
some large stones. When it was dark, the guards gave up their search and
returned to the prison. Harry crawled out and escaped.
   Harry found a job; for 18 months, he worked hard and stayed out of trouble.
Then one day when he came into the bus station, the police were waiting to take
him back to prison. He now had to serve ten years.
   When Harry was escorted to his cell, he was surprised to find that his cell mate
was Alex, his former partner in crime.
   “Hey, I have an idea,” Alex said after Harry settled in.
   “What’s your idea?” Harry asked. And suddenly it was just like old times.
   The prison walls were made of mud bricks with a thick coating of cement over
them. Harry and Alex decided to dig a small tunnel to the outside. It took them
only three days to dig through the wall. The two waited until dark then crawled
through the hole.
   Everything seemed quiet; but as they scrambled up the outside wall, a guard
saw them and shouted. The guards chased them, but Harry and Alex had a good
head start.
   The two stopped a car on the road, made the driver get out, and took the car.
They drove to the city and sold the car for parts. But someone became suspicious
and told the police. Alex escaped, but Harry was caught. This time he was
sent to a small prison where he could be watched more closely. That decision
changed his life.
   To be continued in next week’s Inside Story.

      The Crisis (Within
      and Without)




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Judg. 2:1–15; 1 Kings 12:26–
      31; 2 Chron. 33:9, 10; Jer. 2:1–28; 5:2, 3.

Memory Text: “ ‘ “Israel was holiness to the Lord, the firstfruits of
      His increase. All that devour him will offend; disaster will come upon
      them,” says the Lord’ ” (Jeremiah 2:3, NKJV).



      I
          f we could pick one word to describe the human condition since the
          Fall, it would be crisis, the extent of which can be best understood
          by what it took to get us out of the crisis: the death of Jesus on the
      cross. The crisis must be pretty bad; after all, look at the extreme mea-
      sures needed to solve it.
        All through the Bible, many stories took place against the backdrop
      of one crisis or another. The situation during the time of Jeremiah and
      his ministry was no different.
        God’s people faced many challenges, both from within and from
      without. Unfortunately, despite the terrible military threat from foreign
      powers, in many ways the greatest crisis came from within. “Within”
      meant not just a corrupt leadership and corrupt priesthood, which were
      bad enough, but “within” was in the sense of people whose hearts had
      been so hardened and damaged by sin and apostasy that they refused
      to heed the warnings that God was sending them, warnings that could
      have spared them from disaster.
        Sin is bad enough, but when you refuse to turn away from it—talk
      about a crisis!

     A Quick History
       When the Israelites had finally entered the Promised Land, after
     years of wandering in the wilderness, it wasn’t long before troubles
     began. All it took was for a new generation to arise, one that didn’t
     “know the Lord” (Judg. 2:10), and a spiritual crisis started that, in
     many ways, infected the nation all through its history. It’s a problem
     that, indeed, has infected the Christian church as well.

Read Judges 2:1–15. What caused the crisis, and how was it made
     manifest?

        Verse 11 says: “Then the Israelites did evil in the eyes of the Lord”
     (NIV). Each generation, one after the other, moved one step farther
     from God until the nation was doing exactly what the Lord had told it
     not to do. Due to their sin, the Israelites faced one crisis after another,
     but even then the Lord had not given up on them. He sent them judges
     (Judg. 2:16) who delivered them from their immediate woes.
        After the era of the judges, the nation entered a time of relative peace
     and prosperity under what has been called “the United Monarchy,” the
     rule of Saul, David, and Solomon, which lasted about one hundred
     years. Under David, then Solomon, it grew into a regional power.
        The “good” times, though, did not last. After the death of Solomon
     (about 931 b.c.), the nation split into two factions, Israel in the north
     and Judah in the south. Much of the blame can be placed on the mis-
     guided rule of Solomon, who, for all his wisdom, made numerous mis-
     takes. “The tribes had long suffered grievous wrongs under the oppres-
     sive measures of their former ruler. The extravagance of Solomon’s
     reign during his apostasy had led him to tax the people heavily and to
     require of them much menial service.”—Ellen G. White, Prophets and
     Kings, pp. 88, 89. Things were never the same again for God’s chosen
     nation. Everything the Lord had warned them not to do, they did, and
     thus, they reaped the doleful consequences.

      Think about the problem of the next generation not having the
      values and beliefs of the one before it. How have we, as a church,
      dealt with this issue? How can we learn to transmit our values to
      those who follow us?

                                                                              _
                                                                            15

     The Two Kingdoms
       After the division of the nation, things went from bad to worse. In
     the Northern Kingdom, King Jeroboam made some terrible spiritual
     choices that had a long-lasting impact for evil.

Read 1 Kings 12:26–31. What should this tell us about how immediate
     circumstances can so blind our judgment?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       The king’s introduction of idolatrous worship helped set the nation
     on a disastrous course. “The apostasy introduced during Jeroboam’s
     reign became more and more marked, until finally it resulted in the
     utter ruin of the kingdom of Israel.”—Ellen G. White, Prophets and
     Kings, p. 107. In 722 b.c., Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, put an end to
     the country and deported its inhabitants to different parts of his empire
     (see 2 Kings 17:1–7). There was no turning back from this exile. For a
     time, Israel disappeared from history.
       Things weren’t as bad in the Southern Kingdom, at least not yet.
     But they weren’t great either, and, as with the Northern Kingdom,
     the Lord sought to spare these people from the calamity that the
     Northern Kingdom faced, only now from the threat of the Babylonians.
     Unfortunately, with rare exceptions, Judah had a series of kings who
     continued to lead the nation into deeper apostasy.

What do these verses say about the reign of some of Judah’s kings?
     2 Chron. 33:9, 10, 21–23; 2 Kings 24:8, 9, 18, 19.
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Despite all the terrible leadership, so many of the prophetic books
     of the Bible, including Jeremiah, are the words of the prophets whom
     God sent to His people in an attempt to turn them away from the sin
     and apostasy that was eating at the heart of the nation. The Lord was
     not going to give up on His people without giving them ample time and
     opportunity to turn from their evil ways and be spared the disaster that
     their sin would, inevitably, bring.

      It’s so hard to step out of your own culture and environment and
      look at yourself objectively. In fact, it’s impossible. Why, then,
      must we constantly test our lives against the standard of the
      Bible? What other standard do we have?

      Two Evils
         It was against this background that the young Jeremiah began his
      prophetic ministry. “The word of the Lord” came to him, and he spoke
      it in hopes that the people, if they would heed these words, would be
      spared the ruin that otherwise was sure to come.

Read Jeremiah 2:1–28 and answer the following questions:

What promises had God made to the nation when they were faithful?
      (See vss. 2, 3.)
      _________________________________________________________

What were some of the priests, pastors, and prophets doing that was
      sinful? (See vs. 8.)
      _________________________________________________________

In what terrible ways were the people self-deceived in regard to their
      true spiritual condition? (See vss. 23, 24.)
      _________________________________________________________

        Even though the nation had experienced some spiritual reform
      under the leadership of Hezekiah and Josiah, the people reverted to
      their old ways and fell into worse apostasy. As he did all through his
      ministry, Jeremiah here spoke in no uncertain terms about what was
      going on.
        Particularly interesting are his words in Jeremiah 2:13. The people
      had committed two evils: they forsook the Lord, the fountain of living
      waters, and as a result, hewed out for themselves broken cisterns that,
      of course, could not hold any water at all. In other words, having aban-
      doned the Lord, they had lost everything. These words become even
      more meaningful in light of what Jesus said in John 4:10.

       In Jeremiah 2:5, the Lord said that the people had gone after
       “worthlessness,” and as a result they had become “worthless”
       (ESV). The Hebrew words for both terms come from the same
       Hebrew word (hbl) that is often translated “vanity.” It also
       means “a vapor” or “breath.” How does going after worthless
       things make us “worthless”? What does that mean? How does
       this concept help us to understand those who, at times, feel as
       if their lives are meaningless or worthless? What is the answer
       for them?
                                                                            _

                                                                           17

     The Babylonian Threat
       The background to the political events that shaped the ministry of
     Jeremiah are, to some degree, lost to history. That is, many of the
     details are not available. But we do have in the Bible (with the help of
     archaeological finds) more than enough information to have a general
     picture of what took place. Though from a human perspective it prob-
     ably seemed that no one was in control as these nations battled it out for
     land, power, and hegemony, the Bible teaches us differently.

Read Jeremiah 27:6. What are we to make of this?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        The little kingdom of Judah had, in the early years of Jeremiah’s
     ministry, found itself caught up in the military battles between Babylon,
     Egypt, and the waning power of Assyria. With the decline of the Assyrian
     Empire in the late seventh century b.c., Egypt sought to regain power
     and dominance in the region. However, at the battle of Carchemish in
     605 b.c., Egypt was crushed and Babylon became the new world power.
        This new power made Judah its vassal state. Jehoiakim, king of
     Judah, could stabilize the country only by swearing allegiance to the
     Babylonian king. Many in the country, however, didn’t want to be
     loyal to Babylon; they wanted to fight and free themselves from the
     Babylonians, even though that wasn’t what the Lord intended for them
     to do. On the contrary, God was using Babylon specifically as a vehicle
     to punish the nation for its apostasy.

Read Jeremiah 25:8–12. What was Jeremiah’s message to the people
     of Judah?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Again and again, Jeremiah warned the people about what would hap-
     pen because of their sin, and time and again many of the political and
     religious leaders refused to heed the warnings, believing instead what
     they wanted to believe, which is that the Lord would spare them. After
     all, were they not God’s specially called people?

      When was the last time you believed what you wanted to believe,
      no matter how obviously wrong that belief turned out to be?
      What lessons have you learned so that the same thing doesn’t
      happen again?

     Swearing Falsely
        In Jeremiah 5:1, the Lord tells the people to run through the streets
     and see “if you can find a man, one who does justice and seeks truth,
     that I may pardon her [Jerusalem]” (ESV). This brings to mind two
     stories. One is from an ancient Greek philosopher of the fourth century
     b.c. named Diogenes, who, according to legend, used to walk around
     in the marketplace in the daytime, claiming that he was looking for
     an honest man. The other story, of course, one that we know is true,
     is that of God speaking to Abraham, telling him that if He could find
     50 righteous men (soon reduced to 10), He would not destroy the city.
        The point, though, in the Lord’s words through Jeremiah, was to
     reveal just how widespread the apostasy and sin had become among
     His people. Was there no one who did justice and sought truth?

Read Jeremiah 5:2, 3. What is being said here that shows just how bad
     things were becoming? (See Lev. 19:12.)
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        These verses bring up a point that appears all through the book. No
     matter how deeply fallen the nation had become, many of the people
     believed that they were still faithfully following the Lord! They were
     uttering His name, but they were doing it “falsely” instead of “in truth,
     in justice, and in righteousness” (Jer. 4:2, ESV) as the Lord had com-
     manded them. They did not listen to the warning coming from God,
     but they went on in their lives and religious practices as if everything
     were all right between them and God, when in fact almost nothing was
     right between them.
        The depth of their deception can be seen in Jeremiah 7:4 when the
     people would take a false comfort in these words, hekhal yhwh hekhal
     yhwh hekhal yhwh hemma! (“This is the temple of the Lord, the temple
     of the Lord, the temple of the Lord”), as if having the temple there
     was all that they needed in order to ensure that all would go well with
     them. It’s one thing to know you’re in a crisis; but when you are in one
     and don’t know it, that’s an even worse situation.

      With all the wonderful truth we have been given as Seventh-day
      Adventists, how can we make sure we don’t fall into a similar decep-
      tion of believing our unique calling itself is enough to save us?
                                                                            _

                                                                            _
                                                                           19
                  F riday October 9

Further Thought: “Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here
      this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes” (Deut. 12:8).
      “When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep all
      his commandments which I command thee this day, to do that which
      is right in the eyes of the Lord thy God” (Deut. 13:18). “In those days
      there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in
      his own eyes” (Judg. 17:6, 21:25).
         There’s a crucially important contrast presented in these verses, espe-
      cially in this day and age when many people revolt against the idea of
      being told by an outside authority what to do, or being told what is right
      and wrong. Yet, we can see here a clear distinction between these two
      worldviews. In one, people do whatever they think is “right” in their
      own eyes; in another, people are to do what is right in the “eyes of the
      Lord thy God.” The problem with the first position is that, so often in
      history, what is “right” in someone’s own eyes is often wrong in God’s.
      That’s why we have to submit everything, even our own conscience, to
      the Word of God.


Discussion Questions:
        What are some examples you can think of where “good” people
       did very bad things, even though they thought at the time that
       what they were doing was right? Many cultures today look back
       in horror at what were once common practices. What lessons can
       we draw from this for ourselves today about why we not only need
       to submit to the teaching of the Bible, but also need to be very
       careful in how we interpret the Bible? This is especially important
       when we realize that, in some cases, some of the “bad” things that
       were done were done by those who believed they could justify their
       actions by the Bible. What should this tell us about how basic and
       foundational to all our beliefs the Ten Commandments need to be?

        As we study Jeremiah this quarter, keep in mind the idea that
       despite warning after warning, the people believed that they were
       right with God. What could have caused them to be so deceived
       about their true condition? What message should this have for us
       as well?

A Most Satisfying Career: Part 2
   Some Christian lay workers visited Harry’s prison each week to teach prison-
ers about God. One of the prisoners invited Harry to join them. He went, but his
mind was focused on a way to escape from prison. A lay worker gave him a book
called The Great Controversy. Harry read it, but he was sure that God wouldn’t
bother with him because of all the crimes he’d committed.
   Often at night, some of the prisoners would sing and pray together from their
cells. One night the words of their song touched Harry’s heart. “I’ve wandered
far away from God, now I’m coming home,” they sang. In the darkness, tears fell
unchecked from Harry’s eyes. Then he began sobbing. The same thing happened
again a few nights later. Harry realized that God was calling him to come home,
and he couldn’t refuse.
   Harry hesitated to join any one religious group, for he didn’t know which one
taught Bible truth. He began studying many religions. He even learned Arabic so
he could read the Koran. But no religion seemed to hold the truth.
   Then Harry remembered the book that he had received. He pulled it out and
began reading it again. As he read The Great Controversy, he sensed that this
book was teaching the truth.
   Harry began meeting with the Seventh-day Adventist Bible class, then he
joined their baptismal class and prepared to be baptized. But because of his repu-
tation for escaping, the guards refused to allow Harry to leave for his baptism.
   A month later Harry was transferred back to the original prison from which he
had escaped. When he entered the prison, the guards greeted him. Some of them
had heard that Harry had changed, and they watched to see if it was true. They
even bribed other prisoners to spy on him.
   Harry rejoiced to learn that Adventists held worship services in this prison too.
He joined them and continued studying the Voice of Prophecy lessons he had
started several months earlier. Finally, he was allowed to be baptized.
   Harry wrote to his family and told them that he had given his life to God.
When they visited him, they were amazed at the changes they saw. When Harry
and his family prayed together, the guards bowed their heads too. They even left
him alone with his mother, for they were convinced he would not try to escape
again.
   Harry threw himself into prison ministries from the inside. He held meetings,
enrolled other prisoners in the Voice of Prophecy Bible courses, and shared
books by Ellen White with other prisoners. The Adventist group worshiping in
the prison grew to about one hundred before Harry was released.
   When Harry returned home, he began working as a literature evangelist. He
loves sharing his faith with those he meets and leading them to God. “Leading
souls to Jesus is a new and satisfying career, far better than the one that landed
me in jail,” he testifies.
  Harry Mitengo lives in Liwonde, Malawi.

      The Last Five Kings
      of Judah




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: 2 Chronicles 34, Jer. 22:1–19,
      29:1–14, 2 Chron. 36:11–14, Jer. 23:2–8.

Memory Text: “He defended the cause of the poor and needy, and so
      all went well. Is that not what it means to know me?” (Jeremiah 22:16,
      NIV).



      F
             amed Russian writer Fyodor Dostoevsky spent four years in a
             Siberian prison in the 1800s for subversive political activities.
             Later, writing about his experiences, he talked about some of his
      fellow prisoners’ utter lack of remorse for their terrible behavior. “In
      the course of several years, I never saw a sign of repentance among
      these people; not a trace of despondent brooding over their crimes, and
      the majority of them inwardly considered themselves absolutely in the
      right.”—Joseph Frank, Dostoevsky, The Years of Ordeal, 1850–1859
      (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1990), p. 95.
         Dostoevsky could have been talking about, with the exception of
      Josiah, the five kings who ruled Judah during the ministry of Jeremiah.
      One after another, these men seemed totally unrepentant for their
      actions, even as it became clearer and clearer that their actions were
      bringing the calamities that the Lord, through Jeremiah, had warned
      would come.
         It had never been God’s intention to give Israel a king; by the end
      of this week’s lesson, we will better understand why. We’ll understand,
      too, the severe pressure that poor Jeremiah faced during much of his
      unappreciated ministry.

     Under the Rule of Josiah
        Josiah was the sixteenth king to rule in the Southern Kingdom; his
     reign spanned 640–609 b.c. He became king at the age of eight, after
     more than half a century of moral and spiritual decline under his father
     (Amon) and grandfather (Manasseh), two of the most evil kings in
     Judah. Josiah’s reign lasted for 31 years. Unlike his ancestors, however,
     Josiah “did that which was right in the sight of the Lord” (2 Kings
     22:2), despite an environment that worked against him.
        “Born of a wicked king, beset with temptations to follow in his
     father’s steps, and with few counselors to encourage him in the right
     way, Josiah nevertheless was true to the God of Israel. Warned by the
     errors of past generations, he chose to do right, instead of descend-
     ing to the low level of sin and degradation to which his father and his
     grandfather had fallen. He ‘turned not aside to the right hand or to the
     left.’ As one who was to occupy a position of trust, he resolved to obey
     the instruction that had been given for the guidance of Israel’s rulers,
     and his obedience made it possible for God to use him as a vessel unto
     honor.”—Ellen G. White, Prophets and Kings, p. 384.

Read 2 Chronicles 34. What were the components of Josiah’s reform,
     and why would they be central to any attempt at spiritual reforma-
     tion, be it corporate or personal?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Josiah’s reform consisted of two main components: First, it was get-
     ting rid, as much as possible, of anything and everything that smacked
     of idolatry. That is, he worked to remove the evil practices that had
     arisen in the nation.
        But that was only the first step. An absence of evil or wrong practices
     doesn’t automatically mean that good will follow. Second, after hearing
     the Book of the Law read to him, the king made a covenant before the
     Lord “to keep his commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes,
     with all his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the
     covenant which are written in this book” (2 Chron. 34:31).

      Read 2 Chronicles 34:32, 33. What do these verses tell us about
      the power of a good example, especially among people in posi-
      tions of power and influence? Think long and hard: What influ-

     Jehoahaz and Jehoiakim:
     Another Descent
       Jehoahaz (also known as Shallum) was 23 years old when he suc-
     ceeded his father, Josiah, on the throne. His reign lasted only three
     months. Pharaoh replaced him with his brother, Jehoiakim, because
     Jehoahaz was not favorable toward Egyptian politics. Jehoahaz was
     taken to Egypt, and there he died. (See 2 Chron. 36:4, 2 Kings 23:31–
     34.)
       Jehoiakim reigned 609–598 b.c. When Nebuchadnezzar took
     Jerusalem, Jehoiakim was taken to Babylon along with vessels from the
     temple. During the time of Jehoahaz and Jehoiakim, Jeremiah warned
     the people that these kings were leading the nation down a wrong path.

Read Jeremiah 22:1–19. What were some of the issues with Jehoiakim
     that brought such a stern rebuke from the Lord?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        The Lord, speaking through Jeremiah, had very sharp words for this
     corrupt and covetous ruler. Jehoiakim was an oppressive and greedy king
     who imposed heavy taxes in Judah (see 2 Kings 23:35) in order to pay
     the Egyptians. Worse, using forced labor, he had elaborate construction
     done on his own palace, in defiance of the Torah, which was clear about
     paying people for their work: “Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour,
     neither rob him: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee
     all night until the morning” (Lev. 19:13). Also, unlike Josiah, his father,
     Jehoiakim permitted pagan rites to flourish again in Judah.
        Jeremiah 22:16 is a powerful text. In the context of comparing the
     corrupt Jehoiakim to his father, Josiah, the Lord said to him: “He
     defended the cause of the poor and needy, and so all went well. Is
     that not what it means to know me?” (NIV). In other words, the true
     knowledge of God comes from how one treats those who are in need;
     it comes when we step out of ourselves to benefit those who can really
     do nothing for us in return. We see here, again, as we see all through the
     Bible, the Lord’s concern for the poor and the helpless, as well as the
     obligation we have to help those who cannot help themselves.

      Dwell on the idea that helping the “poor and the needy” is how
      we come to know the Lord. What does that mean?
                                                                              _

     The Short Reign of King Jehoiachin
     of Judah
        The nineteenth king of Judah was Jehoiachin, son of Jehoiakim. He
     reigned on David’s throne for barely three and a half months. In 598
     b.c. Nebuchadnezzar brought his forces to Jerusalem and seized the
     18-year-old king with his mother, his wives, and many other royal cap-
     tives. In 561 b.c., in the thirty-seventh year of his captivity, Jehoiachin
     was given mercy by Evil-Merodach, Nebuchadnezzar’s successor. He
     was granted the right to dine with the king of Babylon, and he could
     wear his kingly robes. (See 2 Kings 25:27–30, Jer. 52:31–34.) His
     sons were also in Babylon with him, yet Jeremiah’s prophecy said they
     would have to give up the throne of David.

Read Jeremiah 29:1–14, the words of the Lord through Jeremiah after
     King Jehoiachin and his family and the court were taken captive
     from Jerusalem. Even amid this tragedy, how were God’s love and
     grace revealed?

       One of the most famous verses in the Bible is this: “ ‘For I know the
     plans I have for you,’ declares the Lord, ‘plans to prosper you and not
     to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future’ ” (Jer. 29:11, NIV).
     Here, of course, we have the immediate context: that of the Lord speak-
     ing through Jeremiah to the captives of Judah who had seen their lives
     completely uprooted by their Babylonian conquerors. Yet, even then, no
     matter how bad their situation seemed, the Lord wanted them to know
     that He still loved them and had only their good in mind. No doubt,
     considering the horrific circumstances, they must have welcomed such
     promising and hopeful words. Thus, even amid all dire warnings and
     threats, the people were still given the promise of “a future and hope.”
     How crucial it must have been for them, especially at that time, to have
     such assurance!

      A future and a hope? What promises can you claim from the
      Lord for “a future and a hope” even right now, regardless of your
      circumstances?

     At the End of the Dead End
Read 2 Chronicles 36:11–14. What do these verses tell us about the
     last king of Judah before the final destruction of the nation? What
     spiritual principles of apostasy are revealed in these texts?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Zedekiah (also known as Mattaniah) took the throne at the age of
     21, placed there by Nebuchadnezzar as a puppet king. Unfortunately,
     as the texts say, he hadn’t learned many lessons from what had gone
     before with previous kings, and as a result he brought even greater ruin
     to the nation.
        Second Chronicles 36:14 states something very profound, a point
     that in many ways went to the heart of their apostasy. Amid the list of
     all the evil done under the reign of Zedekiah, it is said that Judah was
     following “all the abominations of the nations” (NKJV).
        There they were, hundreds of years after the Exodus, hundreds of
     years as the covenant people who were to be a light and a beacon to
     the nations (Deut. 4:5–8), and yet they were still so caught up in the
     prevailing culture, so caught up in the cultural and religious environ-
     ment of their neighbors, that they were doing “all the abominations” of
     the pagans.
        Might there be a message there for us?

Read Jeremiah 38:14–18. What did the king ask him, and why?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       The Lord had made it clear on numerous occasions that the nation
     was to submit to the rule of Babylon, that this conquest was punishment
     for their iniquity. Zedekiah, however, refused to listen, and he formed a
     military alliance against Nebuchadnezzar. The nation relied heavily on
     the hope of an Egyptian military victory. But Nebuchadnezzar was vic-
     torious over Pharaoh’s army in 597 b.c. This defeat permanently sealed
     the fate of Jerusalem and the nation. Despite so many opportunities to
     repent, to reform, to be revived, Judah refused.

      We as a church have been raised up to proclaim a message to the
      world that no one else in the world is proclaiming. In many ways
      that is very similar to what Judah was to do. What lessons can
      and should we learn for ourselves from their mistakes?

     The Dark Years
What became of Israel and Jerusalem after rejecting God’s message?
     Jer. 39:8, 9.
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Everything that God had warned them would happen to them is
     exactly what happened. However much they didn’t want to believe the
     warnings, they certainly did believe them after they all came to pass.
     Who hasn’t, even on a personal level, experienced something similar?
     We’re warned by the Lord not to do something or else this will hap-
     pen, but we do it anyway and, sure enough, what we were told would
     happen happens.

What message is found in Jeremiah 23:2–8? What hope was given the
     people there?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       From a human perspective, all seemed lost: their nation lay in
     ruins, their temple was destroyed, their rulers were exiled and held
     captive, and the city of Jerusalem was a pile of stones. The Jewish
     nation and the Jewish people should have at that time disappeared
     from history, as had so many other nations that had undergone what
     they just had.
       The Lord, though, had other plans, and in the verses above (and in
     many others) He gave them the hope that all was not lost but that a rem-
     nant would return and through them the promises would be fulfilled.
     That is, amid all the warnings of doom and destruction, the prophets
     also gave the people their only hope.
       “The dark years of destruction and death marking the end of the
     kingdom of Judah would have brought despair to the stoutest heart
     had it not been for the encouragements in the prophetic utterances of
     God’s messengers. Through Jeremiah in Jerusalem, through Daniel in
     the court of Babylon, through Ezekiel on the banks of the Chebar, the
     Lord in mercy made clear His eternal purpose and gave assurance of
     His willingness to fulfill to His chosen people the promises recorded in
     the writings of Moses. That which He had said He would do for those
     who should prove true to Him, He would surely bring to pass. ‘The
     word of God . . . liveth and abideth forever.’ 1 Peter 1:23.”—Ellen G.
     White, Prophets and Kings, p. 464.

                                                                          27
                  F riday October 16

Further Thought: “In the closing years of Judah’s apostasy the exhor-
     tations of the prophets were seemingly of but little avail; and as the armies
     of the Chaldeans came for the third and last time to besiege Jerusalem,
     hope fled from every heart. Jeremiah predicted utter ruin; and it was
     because of his insistence on surrender that he had finally been thrown
     into prison. But God left not to hopeless despair the faithful remnant who
     were still in the city. Even while Jeremiah was kept under close surveil-
     lance by those who scorned his messages, there came to him fresh revela-
     tions concerning Heaven’s willingness to forgive and to save, which have
     been an unfailing source of comfort to the church of God from that day
     to this.”—Ellen G. White, Prophets and Kings, p. 466.
        Look at the phrase, “Heaven’s willingness to forgive and to save.”
     Think about all the ways that we have been shown “Heaven’s willing-
     ness” to forgive and save. After all, the Cross alone should tell us about
     this willingness. We have the Word of God, which reveals to us the plan
     of salvation. We have been given the Spirit of Prophecy, a wonderful
     gift. What are other ways we have been shown “Heaven’s willingness
     to forgive and to save”?

Discussion Questions:
        “[The people approached] Jeremiah the prophet and said to
       him, ‘Please hear our petition and pray to the Lord your God
       for this entire remnant. For as you now see, though we were once
       many, now only a few are left’ ” (Jer. 42:2, NIV). What does this
       verse and what we read in Jeremiah 23:3 have to say about the
       remnant theme in Jeremiah?

        It’s so easy from our perspective to look back at sacred history
       and see all the faults and shortcomings and spiritual deficiencies
       of God’s people of antiquity. And we should, because we have
       been told that these stories were written as examples for us (1 Cor.
       10:11). The sad thing is, many of these people at the time, in their
       own context and culture, thought that they were doing the right
       thing, that they were just fine with the Lord. What warning should
       that give us about just how blind we can be to our true spiritual
       state? What are ways we can come to grips with our true spiritual
       condition? Why must we keep the Cross central to that process?
       What would happen to us if we didn’t keep it central to our spiri-
       tual lives?

                                                    Story
The Unexpected Answer
   A small group of Seventh-day Adventists in Malawi planned to hold evan-
gelistic meetings. On the first night of the meetings, we were disappointed
when only a few people came. We prayed, but attendance hovered around
thirty people. Some suggested that we cancel the meetings, but the speaker
refused. “If we pray earnestly,” he said, “God will make something happen.”
   The next evening, the meeting opened with the same 30 people. We sang
and prayed, then the speaker stood up. Suddenly, a commotion of clapping and
cheering drowned out the speaker.
   The commotion increased as a crowd of people following a Nyau
[nee-ow]—a spirit worshiper dressed in swishing grass skirts and rags and
wearing an ornate headdress and mask—approached the meeting place. The
Nyau probably was on his way to a graveyard.
   When the Nyau came nearer, he stopped dancing and turned toward the
speaker. The crowd following him stopped, and the Nyau didn’t move. Instead,
he leaned against a wall, apparently planning to listen to the evangelist. The
crowd following him stopped clapping and listened as the speaker quickly
resumed his message.
   The Nyau listened quietly to the rest of the sermon. (Someone estimated
that two hundred people who had been following the Nyau listened as well.)
The speaker was nervous, but he continued with his presentation about
Nebuchadnezzar’s dream in Daniel 2. After the closing prayer, the Nyau and
his followers continued toward the cemetery.
   The next evening the meeting started with the same 30 people; but as the
program progressed, more came. Even the Nyau, dressed in his mask and
swishing skirts, came with his followers. He didn’t stand outside the meet-
ing place this time but entered the tent and sat down. His followers sat down
too. The speaker couldn’t be sure that the Nyau was the same one who came
previously, but he recognized many of the Nyau’s followers. Other visitors
came, curious to know what was being preached in their neighborhood that
could possibly interest a Nyau. That night almost eighty people attended the
meeting.
   Attendance at the meetings continued increasing. A few nights later, the
speaker invited listeners to accept Jesus as their Savior. That evening 95
people accepted Jesus and asked for further Bible studies.
   The next night nearly two hundred people came, including two more Nyaus,
dressed in torn clothes and wearing leafy branches to cover their faces. That
night an additional 50 answered the call to accept Jesus.
   The meetings continued for 21 nights, and baptismal classes followed. On
the day of the baptism, 145 were baptized. Among them was a man who iden-
tified himself as the Nyau who had interrupted the meeting when he stopped
to listen that first night. This former Nyau continues to be faithful to Jesus.

      Rebuke and Retribution

      I shall be saved, for You are my praise” (Jeremiah 17:14, NKJV).

                 (Eccles. 1:9, ESV).
        Nothing new under the sun? This is especially true when it comes
      to the lives and work of God’s prophets, who were often called to
      deliver words of warning and rebuke to those who should have known
      better. Though seeking to be faithful to their calling, the prophets for
      the most part faced fervent opposition, even retribution, often from
      the spiritual leaders, those who should have been the first to listen to
      them. No wonder Jesus said, “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees,
      hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the
      sepulchers of the righteous, and say, If we had been in the days of our
      fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the
      prophets” (Matt. 23:29, 30).
        This week we’ll start to look at the trials of Jeremiah, whose ministry
      seemed to consist of nothing but rebuke and retribution: he giving the
      rebuke, the leaders giving him retribution.

     The Two Ways
        From the earliest chapters of Genesis to the last chapters of
     Revelation, the Bible presents to us only two options on how to live:
     we either follow the Lord with all our heart and soul, or we don’t. As
     Jesus said, in words that many have found troubling, “He that is not
     with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth”
     (Luke 11:23). This is a powerfully unambiguous statement about spiri-
     tual realities greater than what appears to the naked eye or than what
     common sense would seem to tell us. It’s the great controversy theme at
     its most basic level. And yet, in one sense, Jesus isn’t saying anything
     new or radical. It’s always been this way.

Read Jeremiah 17:5–10. What crucial spiritual principles do we find
     here, especially in light of the great controversy between Christ and
     Satan?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        The immediate context of these words probably reflects Judah’s
     political dalliances, and the Lord wanted them to understand that
     their only help was in God, not in political or military powers, a
     point that they would later learn but only after it was far too late.
     Though the Lord can and does use other people to help us, in the
     end we must always put our trust only in Him. We can never know
     for sure the motives of others; we can always know God’s intentions
     for us.
       With good reason, Jeremiah 17:9 warns about the deceitfulness of
     the human heart. The Hebrew text says that the heart is more deceitful
     than “everything.” The horrific physical effects of sin, as bad as they
     are, aren’t as bad as the moral and spiritual effects. The problem is,
     because our hearts are already so deceitful, we can’t fully know just
     how bad they really are. Jeremiah was soon to see for himself how very
     bad human intentions can be.

      How can you learn to trust in the Lord more than you have
      before? What are ways that you can step out in faith, right now,
      and do what is right in the eyes of the Lord?
                                                                           _

     The Sin of Judah
       Certainly, Jeremiah’s task was not going to be easy. Maybe some
     people might find perverse pleasure in pointing out people’s sins, but
     most would find it to be very unappealing work, especially because
     of the reactions their words would provoke. Though some, when they
     hear the words of rebuke, might repent and reform, that’s usually not
     the case, especially when the rebuke itself is very pointed and strong.
     And indeed, as with all of the prophets, the words of Jeremiah were just
     that: pointed and strong!

Read Jeremiah 17:1–4. What were some of the warnings that Jeremiah
     gave to the people?

        The imagery of the sin engraved on the heart is especially powerful.
     It shows the depth of the corruption. The idea isn’t just that the sin
     is written there, as with a pen, but that it is engraved there, etched in
     with a tool. This all becomes even more powerful when one remembers
     the words of the Lord to Judah’s ancestors: “If you obey the Lord
     your God and keep his commands and decrees that are written in this
     Book of the Law and turn to the Lord your God with all your heart
     and with all your soul” (Deut. 30:10, NIV; compare with Ps. 40:8 and
     Jer. 31:33). It was out of their hearts that they were to love God and
     obey His law; now, instead, their sin—the violation of that law (1 John
     3:4)—is etched in their hearts.
        “Let none who claim to be the depositaries of God’s law flatter
     themselves that the regard they may outwardly show toward the com-
     mandments will preserve them from the exercise of divine justice. Let
     none refuse to be reproved for evil, nor charge the servants of God with
     being too zealous in endeavoring to cleanse the camp from evil-doing.
     A sin-hating God calls upon those who claim to keep His law to depart
     from all iniquity.”—Ellen G. White, Prophets and Kings, p. 416.

      Sin engraved on the heart? That’s a scary thought, is it not? What
      does that image say about just how deep and intense the work of
      purifying our hearts is? What’s the only way to accomplish it?
                                                                            _

     The Warning to Jeremiah
       “And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world,
     and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were
     evil” (John 3:19).

       The sad story of Jeremiah is that the opposition he faced came from
     the very ones whom, through him, the Lord was trying to save. The
     Lord wanted to spare them the disaster that was sure to come. The
     problem, though, is that people often don’t want to hear what they need
     to hear, because it cuts against their sinful and corrupt desires.

Read Jeremiah 11:18–23. What is going on here? What does some of
     the imagery remind us of?

        Though in ancient Israel those who falsely prophesied in the name of
     the Lord could face death, in this case there was no indication that the men
     of Anathoth thought Jeremiah was speaking falsely. Instead, it seemed that
     they just wanted him silenced. They didn’t want to hear what he had to say.
     Though the text doesn’t say how they planned to kill him, some scholars
     have thought that they might have been thinking of poisoning him.
        As we saw, too, Anathoth was Jeremiah’s hometown, and its people
     were rejecting his message, even to the point of being willing to kill
     him. This, though, was only the beginning of a much wider rejection by
     all but a “remnant” of his own nation.
        Of course, all of this, including the “lamb led to the slaughter”
     imagery, evokes the sacrifice of Jesus. In a sense, Jeremiah prefigured
     Christ, not as a type (like the animal sacrifices), but in that he, like
     Jesus, faced powerful opposition from the very ones he was trying
     to help. This situation in Jeremiah’s life definitely calls to mind what
     Jesus went through early in His ministry as well (Luke 4:14–30).

      When was the last time you heard something that you knew was
      right, but you simply didn’t want to hear it? What was your
      initial reaction? In cases like this, why must we learn to take up
      our cross?

      A Lament
        In the earliest chapters of Jeremiah, the Lord had warned his servant
      that his work as a prophet was not going to be easy. At the time of
      his calling, Jeremiah was told that Judah’s princes, kings, priests, and
      people would “fight against [him]” (Jer. 1:19). Although he was told
      that the Lord would sustain him and that his opponents would not “pre-
      vail against [him]” (Jer. 1:19), no doubt the warning that most of his
      own people were going to fight him wasn’t welcome news. Jeremiah,
      though, didn’t yet know the half of it, and when trials came, he was
      understandably angry and hurt.

What universal issue is the prophet struggling with in Jeremiah 12:1–4?
      What is the prophet’s attitude toward those who have hurt him?
      What does this tell us about the humanity of even God’s most faith-
      ful servants?
      _________________________________________________________

         Jeremiah 12:1 is filled with Old Testament legal language: the
      Hebrew words for “righteous,” “bring a case,” and “justice” (NIV) all
      appear in legal settings. The prophet, so upset over what he has been
      facing, is bringing a “lawsuit” (see Deut. 25:1) against the Lord. His
      complaint, of course, is a common one: why do evil people always seem
      to prosper?
         We can see, too, Jeremiah’s humanity exhibited. He wants those
      who have done evil to him to be punished. He’s not speaking here as
      a theologian; he’s speaking as a fallen human being in need of grace
      who, like Job and like many of God’s faithful people, doesn’t under-
      stand why these things are happening to him. Why should Jeremiah,
      God’s servant, called to declare God’s truth to a rebellious people, be
      subjected to the treacherous plots of his own village? Jeremiah trusted
      in the Lord, but he surely didn’t understand why things were happening
      as they were.

       How can we learn to trust in the Lord despite all the things that
       happen that just don’t seem to make sense to us?
                                                                            _

     A Desperate Situation
Read Jeremiah 14:1–10. What is happening here?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Drought struck all of the land; every city, town, and village suffered.
     The poor and the rich suffered together. Not even the wildlife could
     bear the lack of water. The aristocrats waited for their servants at the
     city gates, hoping they had found water, but the springs had dried up.
     There was no water, and without water, life could not continue. Their
     misery grew from day to day. The people put on mourning clothes, and
     walked with their eyes downcast. Then they would suddenly kneel and
     cry out in desperate prayer.
        At the time of such a natural catastrophe, it was the custom to visit
     the temple of Jerusalem (Joel 1:13, 14; 2:15–17) to fast and to make
     special offerings to God.
        Jeremiah saw the eagerness of the people, but he knew well that they
     didn’t seek the Lord, only the water. This saddened the prophet further.
     Jeremiah was also praying, not for water but for the mercy and pres-
     ence of God.
        Jeremiah understood, too, that this was only the beginning of the tri-
     als to come. God saw the hearts of the people and knew that if He were
     to remove the drought, then the repentance would also disappear. The
     people did everything to try to change their situation, including going
     to Jerusalem, praying, fasting, putting on sackcloth, and making offer-
     ings, but they forgot one thing: true conversion, true repentance. They
     were looking only to remove the results of the problem, not the problem
     itself, which was their sin and disobedience.

Read Jeremiah 14:11–16. How do we understand this?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       “Do not pray for this people, for their good,” God told Jeremiah,
     even though Jeremiah presented earlier a great example of intercessory
     prayer: “O Lord, though our iniquities testify against us, do it for Your
     name’s sake” (Jer. 14:7, NKJV). Though we are told to “pray without
     ceasing” (1 Thess. 5:17), in this case the Lord, who knows everything
     from beginning to end, is revealing to Jeremiah just how corrupt and
     fallen these people are. Of course, God knows people’s hearts, and God
     knows the future; we don’t. Hence, the New Testament admonition to
     pray, even for our enemies, doesn’t lose any of its force here.
                                                                            35

Further Thought: Jeremiah struggled with a question that we all do:
     How do we make sense of evil? But maybe that’s the problem, trying
     to make sense of what’s not sensible, what could even be deemed as
     “nonsense.”
        In this regard, Ellen G. White wrote: “It is impossible to explain the
     origin of sin so as to give a reason for its existence. . . . Sin is an intruder,
     for whose presence no reason can be given. It is mysterious, unaccount-
     able; to excuse it is to defend it. Could excuse for it be found, or cause be
     shown for its existence, it would cease to be sin.”—Ellen G. White, The
     Great Controversy, pp. 492, 493. Replace the word sin with evil and the
     statement works just as well: It is impossible to explain the origin of evil
     so as to give a reason for its existence. . . . Evil is an intruder, for whose
     presence no reason can be given. It is mysterious, unaccountable; to
     excuse it is to defend it. Could excuse for it be found, or cause be shown
     for its existence, it would cease to be evil.
        When tragedy strikes, we hear people say, or we ourselves think: I
     don’t understand this. It doesn’t make sense. Well, there’s a good reason
     that we don’t understand it: it’s not understandable. If we could under-
     stand it, if it made sense, if it fit into some logical and rational plan,
     then it wouldn’t be that evil; it wouldn’t be that tragic because it serves
     a rational purpose. How crucial it is that we remember that evil, like
     sin, cannot often be explained. What we do have, however, is the reality
     of the Cross, which shows us the love and goodness of God despite the
     inexplicable evil caused by sin.


Discussion Question:
       Dwell more on this idea that evil and suffering don’t make
      sense, that they don’t have a rational or good explanation. Why is
      it better that way? Think about it. A horrible tragedy strikes: per-
      haps a young child dies of a terrible disease after years of suffer-
      ing. Do we really want to believe that a good and rational reason
      exists for this? Isn’t it better to chalk it up to the terrible and evil
      results of living in a fallen world? Discuss in class.

                                                    Story
Nothing but Faith: Part 1
   John grew up knowing that God was calling him to become a minister.
When he tried to ignore or avoid the call, he found that he could not.
   In Zimbabwe, work for students is nearly impossible to find; so, John had to
rely on his mother’s income when he enrolled at Solusi University, a Seventh-
day Adventist university in Zimbabwe.
   During school breaks, John held short evangelistic meetings in several
churches and rejoiced to see 100 people come to Christ.
   But when he returned home he learned that his mother’s goods weren’t sell-
ing, and there wasn’t enough money for his tuition. “Perhaps you’ll have to
wait a semester to go back to school,” she suggested to John.
   “Don’t worry,” John told her. “God is the one who called me to the ministry,
and He will help with my school fees.”
   John packed his bag, kissed his mother good-bye, and got on the bus to
Solusi, arriving with not enough money to buy a bus ticket back home. He
had nothing but his faith.
   Because he arrived at Solusi too late to register, John stayed in a friend’s
dormitory room that night. The next day he went to see the dean of men to be
assigned a dorm room. The dean was reluctant to give him a room without
financial clearance. But he knew John, and finally he agreed. “Here’s your
key,” the dean said. “But if you haven’t received financial clearance by 5:00
p.m. tomorrow, you’ll have to move out.”
   John thanked him and put his things into the room. Before unpacking, he
knelt down and prayed. “God, thank You for the time that I have this room.
If You don’t pay my fees, I’ll have to move out tomorrow; so, it’s up to You.
Thanks, Lord. Amen.”
   John had heard that an evangelist friend of his, Sister Jeremiah, was hold-
ing meetings on campus. He went to visit her. “Did you pay your fees?” Sister
Jeremiah asked him.
   “No,” he said honestly. “My mom doesn’t have the money. I’ve come so we
can pray about it.”
   “Let’s not ask God for the money,” Sister Jeremiah said. “Let’s just thank
Him for providing the money you need.” So, the two knelt down, and Sister
Jeremiah thanked God for the money John hadn’t yet received.
   The money didn’t come that day. As John walked around campus, several
friends stopped to ask how things were going. John didn’t tell them about his
financial needs but replied, smiling, “Everything is fine; God is in control.”
   One girl on campus knew John’s situation. When she encouraged him to
drop out of school, he replied, “Don’t try to discourage me. God will provide.”
   But by bedtime that night, nothing had happened. John again placed his
situation in God’s hands then went to sleep.

      More Woes
      for the Prophet




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Jer. 23:14, 15; Jeremiah 20;
      Acts 2:37; Job 3; Jer. 18:1–10, 18–23.

Memory Text: “O Lord, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived:
      thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily,
      everyone mocketh me” (Jeremiah 20:7).



      O
               ne thing anyone who has followed the Lord for any length of
               time will learn is that being a believer in Jesus and seeking to
               do His will do not guarantee an easy passage through life. After
      all, as we have been told, “Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ
      Jesus will suffer persecution” (2 Tim. 3:12, NKJV). This is a truth that
      Jeremiah was surely learning for himself.
         At the same time, however, what our faith can do for us in times
      of trial is give us a broader understanding upon which we can steady
      ourselves amid our struggles. That is, when unfair and unjust suffer-
      ings and trials come (and no question, so many of them are unfair and
      unjust), we don’t have to be left alone with a sense of meaninglessness
      and purposelessness that people who don’t know the Lord often feel.
      We can know something of the big picture, and the ultimate hope God
      offers us, no matter how dismal the present is, and from this knowl-
      edge—and hope—we can draw strength. Jeremiah knew something of
      this context, though at times he seemed to forget it and instead focused
      only on his woes.

     Godless Priests and Prophets
        Removed as we are by more than two thousand years chronologi-
     cally from Judah, and perhaps even further removed culturally and
     socially, it’s hard for us to understand all that was going on in the
     time of Jeremiah. When reading the Bible, especially the harsh
     warnings and threats that God uttered against the people, many
     people think that the Lord is portrayed here as harsh, mean, and
     vindictive. This, however, is a false understanding, based only on
     a superficial reading of the texts. Instead, what the Old Testament
     reveals is what the New Testament does as well: God loves human-
     ity and wants it saved, but He does not force our choice. If we want
     to do wrong, even despite His pleas to us, we are free to do so. We
     just have to remember not only the consequences but that we were
     warned about them beforehand.

What were some of the evils that the Lord was dealing with in Judah?
     What were some of the evils Jeremiah was prophesying against?
     Jer. 23:14, 15; 5:26–31.

     _________________________________________________________

        The litany of evils presented here is just a small sampling of what
     God’s people had fallen in10. Both the priests and prophets were “god-
     less,” an incredible irony considering that the priests were to be repre-
     sentatives of God, and the prophets to be spokesmen for Him. And this
     is just the beginning of the problems Jeremiah confronted.
        The evils presented here come under a variety of types. There is the
     apostasy of the spiritual leaders; they also lead others to do evil “so
     that no one turns back from his wickedness” (Jer. 23:14, NKJV). Even
     when the Lord warns about coming judgment, the prophets tell them
     that it won’t come. Meanwhile, as far as they were from God, they had
     forgotten the admonition about taking care of the orphans and about
     defending the poor (Jer. 5:28). In every way, the nation had fallen from
     the Lord. So much of the Bible, at least among the prophetic books
     of the Old Testament, records the Lord seeking to call His wayward
     people back. That is, despite all these evils, and more, He was willing
     to forgive them, heal them, and even restore them. But if they refused,
     what else could be done?


                                                                           39

     Jeremiah in the Stocks
        The job of the prophets has always been to convey God’s message,
     not to count how many people accept or reject it. Generally, the num-
     ber of those who accept what the prophets preach at the time they are
     preaching it is low. For example, though we don’t know how many were
     alive at the time of Noah, we can reasonably assume that the majority
     was not very receptive, given the small number that got into the ark. All
     through sacred history, this seems to be the pattern.

Read Jeremiah 20:1–6. What kind of reception did his message get?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        To gain a better understanding of what was going on here, it’s best to
     read just what the words were that Jeremiah had prophesied, the words
     that got him in trouble with such a high official. In Jeremiah 19, we
     have some of that prophecy: God will bring “evil upon this place” (Jer.
     19:3), He will cause the people to fall by the sword and their bodies to
     be eaten by birds and animals (Jer. 19:7), and He will cause the Judeans
     to cannibalize each other (Jer. 19:9).
        Though no one would have been too happy to be the focus of such
     a prophecy, as a leader, Pashur was especially offended. As with most
     people, his initial reaction was to reject the message; after all, who
     would want to believe something that horrible? More than that, using
     his position, Pashur made the mistake of punishing the messenger. He
     had Jeremiah beaten according to the law (Deut. 25:1–3) and locked
     him up in stocks. Though Pashur released him the next day, this painful
     and humiliating experience didn’t stop Jeremiah from continuing to give
     his prophecy, this time not just against Judea but specifically against
     Pashur and his own family. Before long, the fate of Pashur and his family
     would be a horrifying example to all who would see them in the chains
     of captivity. This is also the first place in the book of Jeremiah in which
     Babylon is mentioned as the place of exile. (The chapters, and even sec-
     tions of the chapters, are not in chronological order.)

      Imagine hearing something like that prophesied against you.
      What do you think your initial reaction would be, as opposed to
      what it should be? (What should it be, anyway?) (See Acts 2:37.)
                                                                              _

     A Fire in His Bones
        Jeremiah’s harsh words to Pashur and the nation (Jer. 20:4–6) weren’t
     his own; they were not uttered out of his anger at having been locked in
     the stocks for a day. They were the Lord’s words to him for the people.
        What comes after, though, comes directly from Jeremiah’s own heart,
     written down under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. It is the heartfelt
     cry of a human being who simply doesn’t like the situation he is in and
     is crying out about it.

Read Jeremiah 20:7–14. What is he saying? What does this teach us
     about his humanity, and our own humanity as well?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        His words at first seem almost blasphemous. One wonders, though,
     why he would say that the Lord had deceived him when, right from the
     start, the Lord had warned him that he was going to face fierce opposi-
     tion. Nevertheless, he complains, “Whenever I speak, all I am speaking
     is ‘violence and destruction.’ No wonder people are against me.”

At the same time, what is the crucial significance of what he says in
     Jeremiah 20:9?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       He would have liked to have given up and stopped preaching, but
     God’s word was like a fire in his heart and a fire in his bones. What a
     powerful metaphor of someone who knew his calling and, despite the
     personal pain, was going to follow that calling no matter what. (We find
     similar thoughts written in Amos 3:8 and 1 Corinthians 9:16.)
       All through these verses, we see the struggle Jeremiah faces; we can
     see the great controversy raging both outside and inside him. One min-
     ute he’s praising God for rescuing the needy from the wicked; the next
     (as we will see tomorrow), he’s cursing the day he was born.

      Why is it so important, especially in terrible circumstances, to praise
      the Lord and to dwell upon all the ways that He has revealed His
      love to us?
                                                                            41

     “Cursed Be the Day”
       Even the harshest critics of the Bible would have to concede a major
     point: the Bible does not gloss over human foibles and weaknesses.
     With the exception of the spotless and sinless Son of God, few Bible
     characters whose lives are presented in any detail in the Bible come
     away without their weaknesses and faults exposed. This goes even
     for the prophets. As stated before, the God these prophets served is
     perfect; the prophets who served Him were not. They, like the rest of
     us, were sinners in need of the righteousness of Christ to be credited
     to them by faith (see Rom. 3:22). From Noah to Peter, and everyone
     in between, all were sin-damaged creatures whose only hope was, as
     Ellen G. White says, to go before the Lord and say: “I have no merit
     or goodness whereby I may claim salvation, but I present before God
     the all-atoning blood of the spotless Lamb of God, which taketh away
     the sin of the world. This is my only plea. The name of Jesus gives me
     access to the Father. His ear, His heart, is open to my faintest pleading,
     and He supplies my deepest necessities.”—Faith and Works, p. 106.

Read Jeremiah 20:14–18. What does this passage tell us about the
     prophet’s state of mind concerning his own personal situation?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       His words here, of course, remind us of Job’s, whose situation was
     much worse than Jeremiah’s (see Job 3). Though Jeremiah had the
     assurance that he was doing God’s will and the assurance that the Lord
     was with him, at this point the pain of his present situation consumed
     him. Whatever his intellectual understanding of what the truth was, for
     now it was overshadowed by his own sorrows.
       At times, many people might find themselves in a similar situation:
     they might intellectually know all the promises of God, but they are so
     overwhelmed by sorrow and pain that these promises are pushed into
     the background, and all they can focus on is their immediate suffering.
     This is an understandable reaction; it doesn’t mean it’s a correct one,
     but it is understandable. What we see here again is the humanity of
     Jeremiah, which is similar to the humanity of us all.

      Have you ever felt the way Jeremiah did here? If so, what did you
      learn from that experience that could help you better cope the
      next time you feel that way?

        Despite all the evil, the Lord was still willing to give people a chance
      to repent. Hence, here, too, we see the grace of God being offered to
      those who will accept it. Even now, they still had time to turn around,
      despite all that they had done.
        In these verses, too, we can see the conditionality of many prophe-
      cies: God says that He will do something, which is often to bring
      punishment. But if the people repent, He will not do what He said
      He would do. What He will do is conditional, depending upon how
      the people respond. Why would God do anything else? He would not
      admonish the people to turn from their evil ways and then still bring
      punishment upon them if they repented and turned from their evil ways.
      In such cases, He won’t punish, and He explicitly says so in these texts.

Read Jeremiah 18:18–23. What reasons do the people believe they
      have for what they want to do to Jeremiah? What is Jeremiah’s very
      human response?

        How utterly frustrated Jeremiah must have felt to be condemned by
      people who attacked him because, they said, they wanted to save the
      “teaching of the law,” the “counsels of the wise,” and “the word from
      the prophets.” How self-deceptive the heart really can be!

       What lessons should we learn about how careful we need to be
       in doing things in the name of the Lord? Bring your answer to

Further Thought: In Jeremiah 18:11–17, we find the Lord telling His
     people to stop doing the things that they are doing. Verse 11 says: “So
     turn from your evil ways, each one of you, and reform your ways and
     your actions” (NIV). Verse 12 basically has the Lord saying that He
     already knows they won’t listen to His warnings and pleas but that they
     will continue to walk in the “stubbornness of [their] evil hearts” (vs. 12,
     NIV). The Lord then tells what He will do because of their disobedience.
     This is one of many places in the Bible that show that God’s foreknowl-
     edge of our free choices in no way infringes upon those free choices.
     After all, why would the Lord have pleaded with them to turn from their
     evil if they didn’t have the freedom to obey or disobey Him? Then, too,
     why would He punish them for not obeying if they didn’t have the free-
     dom to obey? What’s clear is that the Lord knew exactly what their free
     choices would be even before they made them. This crucial truth is also
     seen, for instance, in Deuteronomy 31:16–21. Even before the children
     of Israel enter the Promised Land, the Lord tells Moses that He knows
     they will “turn to other gods and worship them” (Deut. 31:20, NIV).
     Here is more evidence that God’s foreknowledge of our choices does not
     impinge on the freedom we have to make those choices.

Discussion Questions:
       Dwell more on the final question at the end of Thursday’s
      study. Who hasn’t heard people say that they were doing such and
      such because the Lord told them to? (With what can you respond
      to someone who says that?) Though there’s no question that God
      will lead us, in what ways can we test these leadings to make sure
      that they really are of the Lord?

       Jeremiah said that the word of the Lord was like “a fire in his
      bones.” How can we keep that fire burning within us as well?

       What can we find in the verses we looked at this week that
      can help us to understand what’s involved in revival and reforma-
      tion? (After all, wasn’t that what the Lord was looking to do in
      His people?) For example, why is a sense of our own sinfulness so
      important for revival? With this in mind, why must the Cross, and
      the hope it offers, be central to revival as well?

                                                    Story
Nothing but Faith: Part 2
   The next morning John went to a campus prayer service where he prayed for
the students who had needs, and silently prayed for his own need.
   A couple of hours later, he met a friend from Botswana on campus. “Is
everything OK?” his friend asked.
   “Yes,” John said, “everything is OK. God is in control.”
   “How’s your mom?” the friend asked.
   “She’s fine,” John answered. Then without thinking, he added, “But she’s
worried about my school fees.”
   “How much do you need?” the friend asked.
   John needed 50,000 Zimbabwean dollars to register.
   “Here’s 250 pula,” his friend said. At that time, the Botswanan currency was
equivalent to 23,000 Zimbabwean dollars. John thanked his friend warmly.
   John quickly found someone willing to exchange his pula for Zimbabwean
dollars—at a rate that gave him 25,000 Zimbabwean dollars! John hurried to
a phone to tell his mother that God had worked half a miracle.
   “Mom,” he said, “can you please send Mercy [John’s sister] to the bank to
deposit 25,000 [Zimbabwean] dollars?”
   “John,” she answered, “you know I don’t have the money.”
   “Just send Mercy to town,” John said. “God will provide the money.” His
mother was puzzled, but she didn’t argue. So, she asked Mercy to go to town
and wait for God to give her the money for John.
   Meanwhile John went to town to deposit the money he had received into
Solusi’s bank account, then he called his mother again.
   “I’ve been trying to reach you!” she said. “Mercy met a friend of yours
in town who had promised to give you some money for food, but you had
already left for school. So, he asked Mercy to deposit it into your account.
When Mercy told him how much you needed, it was more than he had
planned to give; but when he opened his wallet, he had more than 25,000
Zimbabwean dollars. So, he gave Mercy the money for you. We just need to
know Solusi’s account number so we can deposit it!”
   John’s eyes filled with tears as he heard how God answered his prayers.
He thanked his mother and his sister for helping to make the miracle happen.
   Hurrying back to school, John arrived just minutes before the registrar’s
office closed. His heart felt light, and his step was easy as he thought of how
God had pulled off another miracle for a young man with nothing but faith.
   More than 1,000 students are enrolled at Solusi University. Many, like John,
are there by faith. The school is growing larger, and more space in the din-
ing hall is needed. Thank you for supporting the Thirteenth Sabbath Mission
offering.

      Symbolic Acts




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 4:3–7, Num. 21:1–9, Isa.
      29:16, Rom. 9:18–21, Jeremiah 19, Heb. 5:14, Jer. 13:1–11.

Memory Text: “Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same
      lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?”
      (Romans 9:21).



      E
              very student of the Bible knows that it is filled with symbols,
              things that represent concepts and ideas other than themselves.
              The entire earthly sanctuary service, for example, was a sym-
      bolic prophecy of the plan of salvation. “The significance of the Jewish
      economy is not yet fully comprehended. Truths vast and profound are
      shadowed forth in its rites and symbols. The gospel is the key that
      unlocks its mysteries. Through a knowledge of the plan of redemption,
      its truths are opened to the understanding.”—Ellen G. White, Christ’s
      Object Lessons, p. 133. Through the symbolism of the earthly sanctu-
      ary, or the symbols of prophetic books (such as Daniel 2, 7, 8, and
      Revelation), and in many other ways, the Lord has used symbols to
      convey truth. Meanwhile, Jesus Himself, with His parables and object
      lessons, used symbols to explain deep truths.
         The book of Jeremiah itself is rich with symbolism and imagery. This
      week we’re going to take a look at a few of these symbols, what they
      were, what they meant, and what lessons we should take away from
      them for ourselves.

     Truth in Symbols
      Scripture is exceedingly rich in symbols. All kinds abound, and in
     most cases, they represent truths greater than themselves.

Read Genesis 4:3–7. What do their two different sacrifices symbolize?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Very early in the Bible we can see the difference between the attempt
     to work one’s way to heaven (in the offering of Cain) and the realization
     that salvation is by grace alone, made available to us only through the
     merits of a crucified Savior (the offering of Abel).

Read Numbers 21:4–9. What was the symbolism of the bronze serpent
      uplifted on the pole? (See also John 12:32.)
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        “The Israelites saved their lives by looking upon the uplifted serpent.
     That look implied faith. They lived because they believed God’s word,
     and trusted in the means provided for their recovery.”—Ellen G. White,
     Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 431.
       All through the Old Testament, the earthly sanctuary service was the
     most detailed symbolic representation of the plan of salvation. How
     much the Israelites understood about the meaning of all the rituals has
     been an open question for millennia, though no doubt many did grasp
     the most important of all truths taught there: substitutionary atonement,
     the idea that in order for their sins to be forgiven, a substitute had to die
     in their stead (see 1 Cor. 5:7).
       In fact, through the sanctuary service we have been given symbols,
     not only of the death of Jesus but also of His high priestly ministry in
     heaven, the pre-Advent judgment, and the final disposition of sin at the
     end of the age.

       What other biblical symbols of the plan of salvation can you
       think of? Which ones especially speak to you about God’s saving
       grace and the hope we can derive from it?
                                                                                _

     The Potter’s Clay
What crucial truths are taught from these verses and the symbolism
     found there? (See Gen. 2:7.)

     Jer. 18:1–10 _______________________________________________

     Isa. 29:16 _________________________________________________

     Isa. 45:9 __________________________________________________

     Isa. 64:8 __________________________________________________

     Rom. 9:18–21 ______________________________________________

        Because of the constant rejection and persecution that he faced,
     Jeremiah no doubt wanted to give up. Was it worth struggling and fight-
     ing for that nation? At times he certainly felt that the answer was “No!”
        No question, though, as he watched the potter’s hand, he was given an
     image, a symbol, of how the Lord worked with human clay. Whatever
     other truths are found in the image of the potter and the clay, it does
     teach the ultimate sovereignty of God. That is, however hopeless the
     situation might have seemed from Jeremiah’s perspective, the symbol-
     ism of the potter and the clay showed him that ultimately, despite the
     wrong or even willfully wrong decisions that people make, the Lord is
     in control of the world. He is the absolute source of power and author-
     ity, and in the end He will triumph, regardless of appearances now.
        Centuries after Jeremiah, Paul picks up on this Old Testament image
     in Romans 9 and continues with it, basically using it to teach the same
     lesson that it was to teach Jeremiah. In fact, Paul may even be directly
     referring to Jeremiah 18:6 in Romans 9:21. We can rest assured that,
     despite the reality of human free will and free choices, and the often
     calamitous results of abusing that free will, in the end, we can hope in
     the absolute sovereignty of our loving and self-sacrificing God, whose
     love is revealed on the cross. Evil won’t triumph; God and His love will.
     What a hope we have!

      How can you learn to trust in the lesson of the potter and the clay,
      regardless of present circumstances? What other Bible texts show
      us the reality of God’s sovereignty?
                                                                            _

     The Degeneration of a Nation
        “Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place,
     and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither they
     nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have
     filled this place with the blood of innocents” (Jer. 19:4).

       In this text we are given a few examples of the evils that had over-
     taken Judah. Besides forsaking the Lord, offering incense to “other
     gods,” and shedding innocent blood, they also “estranged this place.”
     The Hebrew verb there means “to make foreign,” “to make strange,” or
     to “profane.” Whether “this place” was the temple itself or Jerusalem,
     the text doesn’t say. The crucial point, though, is that the nation was to
     be holy, special to the Lord (see Exod. 19:5, 6), something different and
     distinct from the nations around them. But that’s not what happened.
     They lost their unique character, the distinctiveness that would have
     made them a witness to the world. They became just like everyone else.

What lessons are here for us?

       “They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons
     with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal, which I commanded not,
     nor spake it, neither came it into my mind” (Jer. 19:5).

        Though the concept of human sacrifice was known in the ancient
     world, it was anathema to the Lord, who forbade the practice to the
     Israelites (Deut. 18:10). The phrase, translated above as “neither
     came it into my mind,” in the Hebrew reads, “it did not rise up on
     my heart.” This was an idiomatic expression showing just how alien
     and far from God’s will such a practice was. If we, sin-hardened,
     fallen beings find it abhorrent, imagine what it must have been like
     to our Holy God!
        Nevertheless, over time, the power of corruption and culture so
     overwhelmed His people that they had degenerated into this horrific
     ritual. What a lesson it should be to us all about how easily we can
     become so blinded by the prevailing culture that we accept, or even
     take part in, practices that—were we connected to the Lord and in tune
     with His Word as we should be—we would never accept. We would,
     instead, be horrified by them (see Heb. 5:14).
                                                                           49

     Smashing the Jar
       As we saw yesterday, the nation had fallen into deep apostasy. The
     people weren’t getting the message. God then used Jeremiah to do a
     powerful symbolic act that, ideally, would help wake them up to the
     danger they were facing.

Read Jeremiah 19:1–15. What was Jeremiah to do, and what was the
     meaning of this act?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Jeremiah had to go to the potter’s house again. This time, though,
     the Lord wanted to make sure that he brought witnesses with him to
     see exactly what he was going to do. The witnesses were the elders and
     priests from Judah (Jer. 19:1). As leaders, they were responsible for
     what happened in the nation, and so they needed to get the message
     that Jeremiah was to give to them through the power of his symbolic
     act. The Potsherd Gate (Jer. 19:2, NKJV), where he was to smash the
     jar, might have been near where the potters worked, and just outside the
     gate might have been where they would dump their shards of ruined
     pots. Thus, the symbolism became even more powerful.
        What good is a smashed clay jar? If the jar were cracked, some use
     might be found for it, even if not for the original intent of the jar. But
     Jeremiah wasn’t merely to crack it. Instead, he was to break it, essen-
     tially rendering it useless. Between the act itself and the words that
     followed, it’s hard to imagine how the people could not have understood
     the warning. Of course, understanding the warning and acting on it are
     two different things entirely.
        What’s even more frightening is the apparent finality of the act. Who
     can repair a smashed jar? Though the Lord gave the nation a hope for
     the future, yet for the moment, unless they were to turn around, the
     Judeans were doomed, they and their children. All the places that they
     had defiled with their abominations and sinful acts would soon be
     defiled with their corpses. Perhaps, the depths of their depravity can
     be best understood by the depths of the punishment that their depravity
     brought upon their heads.

      Think of something ruined—ruined beyond repair. What was it
      originally made for, and what happened to it that now rendered it
      useless? How careful we need to be that this doesn’t happen to us!
                                                                             _

     The Linen Belt
Read Jeremiah 13:1–11. What was the symbolic act Jeremiah was
     ordered to do, and what important lesson was it to teach?

        This symbolic act has caused some difficulties for interpreters
     because the river Euphrates (a common interpretation of the Hebrew
     but not necessarily the only one) was hundreds of kilometers from
     Jerusalem. Ezra needed four months to travel there in one direction
     only (Ezra 7:9). In order to understand the message better, God made
     Jeremiah go back and forth twice. Thus, some scholars have argued
     that some other geographical location was meant. On the other hand,
     some argue that the long distances he had to travel helped show him
     just how far away the children of Israel would be taken. What’s more,
     after returning from such a long trip, Jeremiah could understand the joy
     of returning after 70 years of captivity.
        Whatever the case, the belt symbolizes both the house of Israel and
     the house of Judah, pure and unstained at the time of God’s request. The
     man wearing the belt is God Himself. This shows, among other things,
     just how closely tied God Himself was to His people. Some commenta-
     tors have seen significance in the fact that the belt was made of linen,
     the same material as the priestly garments (Lev. 16:4); after all, Judah
     was to be a priestly nation (Exod. 19:6).
        Just as the belt had been ruined, the pride of the nation would be too.
     As a belt clings to a man’s waist, these people had once clung to the
     Lord and were His source of praise and glory. But they had become
     tarnished and spoiled by contact with the surrounding cultures.

      Read Jeremiah 13:11 and contrast it with Deuteronomy 4:5–8.
      How do these verses together show what happened to the nation?
      What should these texts say to us as well?
                                                                             _

                 F riday November 6

Further Thought: The image of the potter and the clay, especially as
     seen in Romans 9, brings up the important question of how we seek to
     understand God’s actions. The fact is, of course, we often don’t. That
     shouldn’t be surprising, should it? Read Isaiah 55:8. As human beings,
     we simply are very limited in what we can know about anything, much
     less about all the ways of God.
        This point, the limitation of human knowledge, is revealed by what
     has been called the “self-referential problem.” Look at this sentence:
     “The barber of Seville shaves everyone who doesn’t shave himself.”
     Does the barber of Seville shave himself? If he shaves himself, he can’t
     shave himself because he shaves everyone who doesn’t shave himself.
     But if he doesn’t shave himself, then he has to shave himself, for the
     same reason—because he shaves everyone who doesn’t shave himself.
     The answer forms an insolvable paradox that reveals the limits of rea-
     son. Thus, if reason gets tangled in itself on something as mundane as
     whom the barber of Seville shaves, how much more so on something
     as profound as the nature and extent of God’s dealings in the world?
     What we do have is the Cross, which gives us abundant reason to trust
     in Him and His love even when what happens in His world makes no
     sense to us at all.
        “To many minds the origin of sin and the reason for its existence are
     a source of great perplexity. They see the work of evil, with its terrible
     results of woe and desolation, and they question how all this can exist
     under the sovereignty of One who is infinite in wisdom, in power, and
     in love. Here is a mystery of which they find no explanation. And in
     their uncertainty and doubt they are blinded to truths plainly revealed
     in God’s word and essential to salvation.”—Ellen G. White, The Great
     Controversy, p. 492.


Discussion Questions:
       What challenges does the idea of God’s absolute sovereignty
      present to us in regard to the question of evil? How does the great
      controversy scenario help us work through the tough questions, at
      least partially for now?

       What other symbols can you find in the Bible? Why would God
      use symbols anyway? What are the advantages of symbols?

                                                    Story
Enlarge My Vision: Part 1
   I never intended to become a Christian. I met God while enrolled in a public
boarding school. Actually, I met a girl whom I wanted to date. I got up the
courage to ask her out then went to her study hall to charm her into dating
me. I knew she was a Christian, but that didn’t bother me. When I entered the
room, I found her reading a pamphlet. I sat down beside her and asked her
what she was reading. She offered me one of the pamphlets, and I pretended
to read it just to impress her. When I asked her for a date, she gently declined
but asked me to keep the pamphlet. Later that evening I sat down and read it.
It was a Voice of Prophecy lesson about hell, and it worried me. I hardly slept
that night.
   I was often in trouble because I frequently broke the school’s rules. On
Saturday morning, the day after I had asked this girl for a date, I went to the
administration building to see if I had been caught breaking any rules that
week and had been assigned campus duties.
   As I was reading the list, a boy came up beside me and invited me to come
to a worship service with him that day in the auditorium. I hadn’t been to
church in ten years and wasn’t interested in religion. But, for some reason, I
accepted this boy’s invitation. I think even he was surprised when I accepted!
We walked across campus together and entered the auditorium. It didn’t dawn
on me that the girl I had asked out the day before was a Seventh-day Adventist.
   Something else really strange happened. I had two dollars in my pocket that
I had planned to spend on drinking on Saturday night. But when the offering
basket was passed, I surprised myself by giving the two dollars. Later I real-
ized that this action saved me from drinking that weekend.
   I discovered that this group of high school students on campus did more
than just pray and sing. They had a strong Pathfinder program. I was interested
in what Pathfinders do, so I stayed through the afternoon and watched. The
next week I joined the Pathfinder Club. Everyone was surprised.
   While I hadn’t accepted the invitation to attend church because of the girl I
wanted to date, I was glad when I saw her at church. She befriended me and
helped me to feel welcome at the church meetings. But she still wouldn’t go
out with me.
   From the first day I attended church, I decided to stop smoking and drink-
ing. Thank God, I never smoked or drank again. When I broke away from old
friends, they gave me trouble about my new religious interest. They begged
me to go drinking with them and did everything they could to get me back.
But I refused. I made new friends in church. Several months later I gave my
life to Christ and followed Him in baptism. I was 17 years old at the time.

      The Crisis Continues




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Jeremiah 9, Jer. 10:1–15, Rom.
      1:25, Jeremiah 26, Acts 17:30, Acts 5:34–41.

Memory Text: “ ‘But let him who glories glory in this, that he under-
      stands and knows Me, that I am the Lord, exercising lovingkindness,
      judgment, and righteousness in the earth. For in these I delight,’ says
      the Lord” (Jeremiah 9:24, NKJV).



      T
              he travails and trials of God’s servant continue. In fact, pretty
              much all of the book of Jeremiah deals with the challenges and
              struggles the prophet had in trying to get the people to listen to
       the words that the Lord was seeking to convey to them out of love and
       concern.
          Imagine what would have happened if the people had listened
       to Jeremiah and had accepted the prophet’s warning. If they had
      ­listened—if the people, the kings, and the leaders had humbled them-
       selves before God—the terrible crisis would not have come. The chance
       for repentance was before them. Even after they had done so much
       wrong, so much evil, the door to redemption and salvation had not
       closed. The door stood open; they simply refused to walk through it.
          Again, it’s so easy for us today to shake our heads at the hardness of
       their hearts. “Now all these things happened to them as examples, and
       they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages
       have come” (1 Cor. 10:11, NKJV). We have these examples before us;
       what will we learn from them?

     Let Him Who Boasts . . .
        In Jeremiah 9, the prophet began his lamentation because he saw
     the inevitable catastrophe coming to his country and people. God pro-
     nounced judgment over Jerusalem, and when God says something, He
     does it. What they would face wasn’t something fortuitous, not just one
     of those terrible and inexplicable things that happen from time to time.
     No, what they would face was going to be the direct judgment of God.
     And it was this realization that was causing Jeremiah such sorrow. His
     sorrow, though, was only a small reflection of the pain that God must
     have felt.
        Though the context is different, this quote captures the idea so well:
     “The cross is a revelation to our dull senses of the pain that, from its
     very inception, sin has brought to the heart of God. Every departure
     from the right, every deed of cruelty, every failure of humanity to reach
     His ideal, brings grief to Him. When there came upon Israel the calami-
     ties that were the sure result of separation from God,—subjugation by
     their enemies, cruelty, and death,—it is said that ‘His soul was grieved
     for the misery of Israel.’ ‘In all their affliction He was afflicted: . . .
     and He bare them, and carried them all the days of old.’ Judges 10:16;
     Isaiah 63:9.”—Ellen G. White, Education, p. 263.

Read Jeremiah 9, the prophet’s sorrowful lament. Focus especially on
     verses 23, 24. Why are those words so relevant even to us today?

        It has been said that when it comes to death, we are all like an
     “unwalled city.” Wisdom, might, and riches all have their place, but to
     rely on these things, especially amid catastrophe, or when death looms,
     is fruitless, meaningless, and empty. Amid all the warnings about the
     doom, the people are told what really matters, and that is to know and
     to understand for oneself, at least to the degree that we can, the loving
     kindness, the justice, and the righteousness of God. What else is there,
     what else alone can give us hope and comfort when everything earthly,
     everything human, including our own flesh, fails us?

      What does the Cross tell us about the loving-kindness, the justice,
      and the righteousness of God?

     Creatures or the Creator?
        As we have seen already, God’s people had been called out to be dif-
     ferent from the nations around them, which were all steeped in pagan-
     ism, idolatry, and false teachings. So many of the warnings in the first
     five books of Moses were especially against following the practices of
     their neighbors. Instead, the Israelites were to be witnesses to the world
     of the truth about the Lord as Creator and Redeemer. Unfortunately, so
     much of Old Testament history is the story of how they were often lured
     into the very practices that they were warned against.

Read Jeremiah 10:1–15. What is the Lord telling His people here? If
     this same warning were given today, in our time and culture and
     context, how might it be written?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Jeremiah is telling the people what they should have already known:
     these pagan gods are nothing but human creations, figments of people’s
     own demonically warped imaginations. This is a prime example of
     what Paul, writing centuries later, meant when he wrote about those
     who “changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served
     the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen”
     (Rom. 1:25).
       Notice in this verse how Paul contrasts the creation and the Creator.
     This same contrast is presented in these verses in Jeremiah, which talk
     about the impotence and weakness of these “gods” in contrast to the true
     One. All through these texts Jeremiah is trying to show the people how
     foolish and silly it is to put their trust in these things, which are incapable
     of doing anything. All this in contrast to the Creator God, who not only
     created the world but sustains it by His power (see Heb. 1:3).
       However ancient these texts, the message is still so relevant. We
     might not be tempted to bow down and worship man-made statues;
     nor are most of us dismayed or worried about the signs in the heavens.
     Instead, though, it’s still so easy to put our trust in things that can no
     more save us than these idols could save Judea on the day of judgment.

      What are some things that, if we are not careful, we come to trust
      more than we should?
                                                                                  _

     A Call to Repentance
Read Jeremiah 26:1–6. What hope is the Lord offering the people here?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       The message here was the same as the message all through the Bible,
     Old and New Testament, and that is the call to repentance, to turn away
     from our sin and find the salvation that God offers to all.

What is the message of the following texts? 2 Chron. 6:37–39, Ezek.
     14:6, Matt. 3:2, Luke 24:47, Acts 17:30.
     _________________________________________________________

        “The inhabitants of Judah were all undeserving, yet God would not
     give them up. By them His name was to be exalted among the heathen.
     Many who were wholly unacquainted with His attributes were yet to
     behold the glory of the divine character. It was for the purpose of mak-
     ing plain His merciful designs that He kept sending His servants the
     prophets with the message, ‘Turn ye again now everyone from his evil
     way.’ Jeremiah 25:5. ‘For My name’s sake,’ He declared through Isaiah,
     ‘will I defer Mine anger, and for My praise will I refrain for thee, that
     I cut thee not off.’ ‘For Mine own sake, even for Mine own sake, will
     I do it: for how should My name be polluted? and I will not give My
     glory unto another.’ Isaiah 48:9, 11.”—Ellen G. White, Prophets and
     Kings, p. 319.
         Old Testament, New Testament—in the end, the message of God is
     the same to all of us: we are sinners, we have done wrong, we deserve
     punishment. But through the cross of Christ, through the atoning death
     of Jesus, God has made a way for all of us to be saved. We need to
     acknowledge our sinfulness; we need to claim by faith the merits of
     Jesus, which are freely given us despite our unworthiness; and we need
     to repent of our sin. And, of course, true repentance includes putting sin
     out of our lives by the grace of God.

      No matter what we have done, we can repent of our sin and be
      forgiven. This is the great provision of the gospel. What sin, or
      sins, do you need to repent of right now?
                                                                            59

      The Call for Death
        From our perspective looking back, it’s hard to believe the hardness
      of the hearts of the people. As we saw in yesterday’s lesson, Jeremiah’s
      message—however strong—was still filled with hope. If they repented,
      God would avert the horrific punishments that, based on the covenant
      promises and curses, would come upon them. If only they would do
      what they were supposed to do, if only they would obey God and
      obtain the blessing that obedience would bring, then all would be well.
      God would forgive, God would heal, God would restore. The gospel
      provision, which would eventually come through the sacrifice of Jesus,
      would be enough to forgive all their sins and restore the people.
        What a message of hope, of promise, of salvation!

What was the response to Jeremiah and his message? (See Jer. 26:10, 11.)
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        In Israel, only a legally assembled court could pass a death sen-
      tence. Only a majority vote of the judges was acceptable for the death
      sentence. The priests and the prophets prosecuted Jeremiah with their
      deadly accusations. Those opposed to him wanted to present him as a
      political criminal and as a traitor.

What was Jeremiah’s response? (Jer. 26:13–15).
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         Jeremiah didn’t back down at all; with the threat of death before him,
      the prophet, no doubt in some fear, nevertheless did not soften a single
      word of the message that he had been given by the Lord, who specially
      warned him at the start not to hold back a word (Jer. 26:2). Thus, in
      contrast to the Jeremiah who at times was whining, complaining, and
      cursing the day of his birth, we see him now as a man of God who is
      standing faithfully and with conviction.

       When was the last time you had to stand faithfully, at a personal
       cost to yourself, for the truth as it is in Jesus? If you never have
       had to do that, what’s wrong?

     Jeremiah’s Escape
       As we saw yesterday, whatever his fears, whatever his own emotions,
     Jeremiah stood firm, fully aware of the potential death that his stance
     could bring him. He warned the princes and the people very clearly in
     Jeremiah 26:15 (“know for certain” [NKJV], he said) that if they killed
     him they would face punishment for spilling innocent blood. Jeremiah
     knew that he was not guilty of the charges against him.

Read Jeremiah 26:16–24. How did Jeremiah escape death?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       How fascinating that the priests and the prophets, the ones who were
     supposed to be the spiritual leaders, had to be rebuked and challenged
     by mere “elders” and “regular people” who came forward in defense
     of Jeremiah. They brought up the memory of Micah, who had lived a
     century before Jeremiah, in Israel. The king then did not hurt Micah
     but listened to his advice, the whole nation repented, and disaster was
     averted, at least for a time. Now these people in Jeremiah’s day were
     wiser than their leaders and wanted to spare the nation from making a
     big mistake by putting a prophet of God to death.
       The acquittal emphasized that Jeremiah was not guilty of those
     things he was accused of. However, the priests’ and prophets’ hatred
     became stronger. Anger and the desire for revenge rose in them so
     that at a later time they would pounce on Jeremiah with their full fury.
     His release meant only a moment of ease for the prophet. He was not
     completely out of danger.
       What we can see here is an example of how some people learned
     lessons from history while others, knowing the same history, refused to
     learn the same lessons. We can see something similar centuries later,
     with the Pharisee Gamaliel and his caution to other leaders concerning
     how to handle the followers of Jesus.

      Read Acts 5:34–41. What parallels exist here with what happened
      to Jeremiah? More important, what lesson can we ourselves
      learn from history and from the mistakes of those who have come
      before us?
                                                                           _

Further Thought: “Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid
     down his life for us” (1 John 3:16). No doubt we can look around in
     nature, in human relationships, and in the marvels of the creation itself
     and get a view of God’s love, however much sin has damaged that cre-
     ation as well as our ability to appreciate or even read it correctly. But at
     the cross, veils were torn off, and the world was given the starkest and
     sharpest revelation possible of that love—a love so great that it led to
     what Ellen G. White called “the sundering of the divine powers.”—The
     SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 924.
        The sundering of the divine powers?
        So great was God’s love for us that the Godhead, whose members loved
     each other from eternity, endured this “sundering” in order to redeem us.
     “ ‘My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?’ ” (Matt. 27:46) is the
     clearest and most powerful expression of that “sundering,” of what it
     cost to save us. Here, we can again see the pain and suffering the Lord
     has endured because of our sin.
        No wonder, then, that “we love because he first loved us” (1 John
     4:19, NIV). Of course, as fallen humans we only imitate that love, and
     even that imitation is often warped by our own selfishness and sinful
     desires. God’s love transcends ours; we reflect God’s love the way an
     oily mud puddle reflects the sky.

Discussion Questions:
       Though many of us today don’t worship animals or things in
      nature the way the ancients did, in what ways are we still in danger
      of making an idol or a god out of nature itself?

       What is the role of repentance in the life of a Christian? That
      is, outside of one’s initial repentance in the course of first accept-
      ing Jesus, what role does repentance continue to have in the life of
      faith?

       Try to wrap your mind around the idea of the “sundering of
      the divine powers.” How are we to understand this? If nothing else,
      what does this tell us about just how deadly and costly sin is?

Enlarge My Vision: Part 2
   After completing high school, I worked as a literature evangelist for
three years. One day I visited a hospital, and there I saw someone who
looked familiar. I barely recognized him, but it was one of my former
drinking buddies, my childhood friend. He was dying of tuberculosis and
AIDS. I stared at him in shock as he lay there unconscious. It was too late
for me to share Christ with him; but I couldn’t shake the realization that
if I had resisted God’s call, it could have been me lying there. My former
friend died a few days later. This experience deepened my conviction that
I must answer God’s call whenever and wherever it comes. To put it off
could mean death.
   I planned to be a literature evangelist for the rest of my life. After all, it
had been the printed page that had influenced me to consider Christ. But
the local field called me to pastor three churches. I had no training as a
minister and had never thought about doing this kind of work. I struggled
to decide whether to take this call, because it was not in the direction I
thought God had been leading me. Nevertheless, I finally accepted the
call.
   After I had been in the ministry for several years, the conference urged
me to study at Solusi University. During school breaks, I held evangelistic
meetings wherever someone asked me to go. Word spread that I was will-
ing, and more invitations came. I discovered that this is what I love to do.
   During an evangelism field school, a speaker challenged us to expand
our vision of how God can use us. “Don’t limit yourself,” he said, “and
don’t limit God.” The speaker’s words challenged me. But how could I
expand my vision of what God expected of me? He had already done so
much more than I thought would ever be possible!
   Several months later I received a call to hold evangelistic meetings in
South Africa. I looked at the calendar and realized that the dates they
gave me were the dates of my final exams. Because of my prayer for
God to expand my territory, I didn’t tell the people in South Africa of my
dilemma, but I fasted and prayed that God would make it possible for me
to go. I believed God would open the way. I knew that the dates for the
meetings were not changeable, and I knew I could not change my exam
schedule. God went to work on my behalf, and I learned that my exams
had been moved up a full week. I could take my exams and still minister
in South Africa!
   The meetings were such a blessing. Nineteen people gave their lives to
God. Surely God has increased my territory, enlarged my vision, and made
a worthless sinner into a willing instrument of God’s power.

      Josiah’s Reforms




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: 2 Chronicles 33, Hab. 1:2–4,
       2 Kings 22, Phil. 2:3–8, 2 Kings 23:1–28, 1 Cor. 5:7.

Memory Text: “Now before him there was no king like him, who
      turned to the Lord with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all
      his might, according to all the Law of Moses; nor after him did any
      arise like him” (2 Kings 23:25, NKJV).



      P
            arents know just how hard it is to see their children, especially
            when they are older and out of the parents’ control, make choices
            that they know will hurt them. Of course, this heartache doesn’t
      apply only to parents and children: Who hasn’t at some point seen
      friends or relatives or anyone make choices that you knew would be
      detrimental to them? This is an unfortunate aspect of what it means to
      have free will. Free will, especially moral free will, means nothing if we
      don’t have the freedom to make wrong choices. A “free” being who can
      choose only the right is not truly free or even truly moral.
         Thus, much of Scripture is the story of God warning His people
      about not making wrong choices. This has been a major part of what
      the book of Jeremiah is about, too: the pleadings of God, who respects
      free choice and free will, to His chosen nation.
         And though, unfortunately, most of the stories are not good, this
      week we will get to see a glimmer of hope; that is, we see one of the
      few kings who, using free will, chose to do what “was right in the sight
      of the Lord.”

      The Reigns of Manasseh and Amon
         However much we like to talk about objectivity, about viewing
      things as they really are, as human beings we are hopelessly subjec-
      tive. We see the world, not so much as the world really is but as we
      really are. And because we are fallen and corrupted beings, this cor-
      ruption is going to impact our perceptions and interpretation of the
      world around us. How else, for instance, can we explain someone like
      King Manasseh of Judah (about 686–643 b.c.), especially those early
      years of his terrible apostasy? One can hardly imagine how he justi-
      fied in his own mind the horrific abominations he allowed to flourish
      in Judah.

Read 2 Chronicles 33. What does this story tell us about just how cor-
      rupt a king Manasseh was? More important, what does this teach
      us about the willingness of God to forgive?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         No question, being hauled off to Babylon with nose hooks and bronze
      fetters was certain to get a man to rethink his life. Nevertheless, the text
      is clear: Manasseh truly repented of his ways and, when restored to the
      throne, sought to repair the damage that he had done. Unfortunately, the
      damage was greater than he might have imagined.
         “But this repentance, remarkable though it was, came too late to save
      the kingdom from the corrupting influence of years of idolatrous prac-
      tices. Many had stumbled and fallen, never again to rise.”—Ellen G.
      White, Prophets and Kings, p. 383. And, even more unfortunate, among
      those who had been terribly impacted by Manasseh’s apostasy was his
      son, Amon, who took the throne after his father died and who “did evil
      in the sight of the Lord, as his father Manasseh had done; for Amon
      sacrificed to all the carved images which his father Manasseh had
      made, and served them” (2 Chron. 33:22, NKJV). Worse, unlike his
      father, Amon never repented of his ways.

       Who doesn’t know personally the terrible consequences that can
       come even from sin that has been forgiven? What promises can
       you claim for the victory over sin? Why not claim them now
       before the sin brings its doleful consequences?
                                                                                _

     A New King
        A preacher once said, “Be careful what you pray for. You just might
     get it.” Israel asked for and longed for a king, just like the nations around
     it. The people got what they asked for, and so much of Israelite history
     after the era of the judges was the story of how these kings corrupted
     themselves on the throne and, as a result, corrupted the nation as well.
        Nevertheless, there were always exceptions, such as King Josiah,
     who ascended the throne in 639 b.c. and ruled until 608 b.c.

What was the context in which the new king had come to the throne?
     (See 2 Chron. 33:25.)
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Though democracy is supposed to be rulership by the people,
     it generally wasn’t conceived of functioning as it did in this case.
     Nevertheless, the people made their will known, and it was done
     according to their will. The young king came to the throne at a time
     of great turmoil, apostasy, and violence, even at the highest levels
     of government. Seeing what was going on, many faithful in the land
     had wondered whether God’s promises to ancient Israel could ever be
     fulfilled. “From a human point of view the divine purpose for the cho-
     sen nation seemed almost impossible of accomplishment.”—Ellen G.
     White, Prophets and Kings, p. 384.

The anxiety of the faithful ones was expressed in the words of the
     prophet Habakkuk in Habakkuk 1:2–4. What is the prophet saying?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Unfortunately, the answer to the problems of iniquity, violence, strife,
     and lawlessness would come, but from the north, from the Babylonians,
     whom God would use to bring judgment upon His wayward people. As
     we have seen all along, it didn’t have to be that way; however, because
     of their refusal to repent, they faced the punishment that their sins
     brought upon them.

      From a human point of view, how often does “the divine purpose”
      seem to be impossible to accomplish? What does this tell us about
      how we need to reach out in faith beyond what we see or fully
      understand?
                                                                                _

     Josiah on the Throne
        “Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he
     reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name
     was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath. And he did that
     which was right in the sight of the Lord, and walked in all the way
     of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the
     left” (2 Kings 22:1, 2).

Considering the context of Josiah coming to the throne, what is so
     remarkable about the above texts?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       The Bible doesn’t give us any explanation for this remarkable young
     man who, considering the circumstances, was most likely destined
     to be as corrupt and wicked as his father before him. That, however,
     wasn’t the case. For whatever reasons, he chose a different course, and
     that was to have a positive, though ultimately limited, impact on the
     nation.
       Second Kings 22 mentions what Josiah did in regard to the temple.
     From the dedication of the temple by Solomon, long centuries had
     passed until Josiah’s reforms (622 b.c.). The kings had not really taken
     care of the temple. Time had eroded the building, which had once been
     beautiful. The young king saw that the temple was no longer suitable
     for worship as a result of long years of neglect.

What did Josiah do when he discovered the temple was in such disre-
     pair? 2 Kings 22:3–7.
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Today we would say that the king sent his minister of finance to the
     high priest and asked him to plan and oversee the materials and labor
     required to renovate the temple. They did not have to account for the
     money with which they were entrusted because they were acting faith-
     fully. For whatever reasons, Josiah showed trust in them, and as far as
     the record shows, that trust was honored.

      Refurbishing the temple is fine, but in the end, what really is cru-
      cial for a true revival and reformation? (See Phil. 2:3–8.)
                                                                          67
        W ednesday November 18

     The Book of the Law
       The renovation of the temple, long the center of Israelite worship,
     was important, but renovation of a building wasn’t all that was needed.
     The most beautiful and elaborate structure, though designed to help
     worshipers sense something of the power and grandeur of the Lord, in
     and of itself isn’t enough to evoke piety among the people. History is
     replete with the sad stories of people who one minute were “worship-
     ing” in some beautiful church somewhere and the next minute were
     walking out and committing an atrocity, which was perhaps even insti-
     gated by what they learned inside that beautiful structure.

What happened during the renovation of the temple? What is the power-
      ful significance of Josiah’s reaction to those events? 2 Kings 22:8–11.
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       They found the “Book of the Law.” The Bible doesn’t specify which
     of Moses’ writings were found. It was probably found buried in the
     walls somewhere in the temple.

Read 2 Kings 22:12–20. What was Huldah’s message from God to the
      people and for King Josiah? What should these words say to us?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Huldah transmitted the same message Jeremiah had already proph-
     esied several times. The people who had turned away from God had
     dug their own grave through their deeds, and they were going to reap
     the consequences. Josiah never would see the trouble and die in peace.
        “Through Huldah the Lord sent Josiah word that Jerusalem’s ruin
     could not be averted. Even should the people now humble themselves
     before God, they could not escape their punishment. So long had their
     senses been deadened by wrongdoing that, if judgment should not
     come upon them, they would soon return to the same sinful course.
     ‘Tell the man that sent you to me,’ the prophetess declared, ‘Thus saith
     the Lord, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, and upon the inhab-
     itants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah
     hath read: because they have forsaken Me, and have burned incense
     unto other gods, that they might provoke Me to anger with all the works
     of their hands; therefore My wrath shall be kindled against this place,
     and shall not be quenched.’ Verses 15–17.”—Ellen G. White, Prophets
     and Kings, p. 399.

     Josiah’s Reforms
       Despite the forewarning of doom, Josiah was still determined to do
     what was “right in the sight of the Lord.” Maybe disaster couldn’t be
     averted, “but in announcing the retributive judgments of Heaven, the
     Lord had not withdrawn opportunity for repentance and reformation;
     and Josiah, discerning in this a willingness on the part of God to temper
     His judgments with mercy, determined to do all in his power to bring
     about decided reforms.”—Ellen G. White, Prophets and Kings, p. 400.

Read 2 Kings 23:1–28. What was the essence of the reform that the
     faithful king sought to bring to his corrupted nation? What do
     these acts tell us about just how bad things had become in the
     chosen nation?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Josiah gathered all the people in Jerusalem in order to renew their
     covenant with God. The recently found Book of the Law was read, and
     then they made the vow to follow the God of Israel.
        The king did not execute this work by himself but asked those who
     had spiritual responsibilities to do what was needed. As an example,
     throughout the centuries, different objects—statues and symbols that
     popularized foreign worship in Israel—had been gathered into the tem-
     ple. Sometimes they had been part of the conditions of peace, imposed
     upon the nation; sometimes kings had exhibited them in order to sig-
     nify their pacification, a sign of surrender. Whatever the reasons, they
     did not belong there, and Josiah ordered them removed and destroyed.
        Also, the Passover celebration during Josiah’s reform did not take
     place only within the family households, as had been the custom
     before, but now the whole nation celebrated it together. Its symbolic
     message for the people was that they had left the old era behind them,
     and that they had now entered a new time in which they vowed to serve
     the true God, who led them out of Egypt, who provided a home for the
     tribes as He had promised, and who was with them in their everyday
     lives.

      The significance in celebrating the national Passover was to
      start something new because (ideally, anyway) all the old things
      had come to an end. What should the symbolism of the Passover
      mean to us now, as Seventh-day Adventists? (See 1 Cor. 5:7.)
                                                                            _
                                                                           69
                   F riday November 20

Further Thought: As the lesson stated, the depth of corruption that had
      befallen Israel can be seen in the kind of reforms that Josiah had to under-
      take. How, though, could the nation have fallen so far? In one sense, the
      answer is easy: it’s because humanity has fallen so far. Just how far human-
      ity has degraded was revealed in a famous experiment conducted at Yale
      University in the 1960s.
         Participants were brought in arbitrarily through newspaper ads and
      told that they were to administer electric shocks to people tied down to
      chairs in another room. The switches that administered the shocks were
      marked from “Slight Shock” to “Danger: Severe Shock,” including two
      more ominously marked “XXX.” Participants were told to administer
      the shocks according to the orders of the scientist leading the experi-
      ment. As they did, the participants would hear the people in the other
      room scream and plead for mercy. In reality, the people in the other
      room were just acting; they were not getting shocked at all. The point
      of the study was to see how far these “normal” participants would go in
      inflicting what they thought was pain on those whom they didn’t know,
      simply because they had been ordered to do it. The results were fright-
      ening. Though many participants got anxious, distraught, and even
      angry, that didn’t stop a stunning 65 percent from administering the
      severest “shocks” to these people, believing that they were truly hurting
      them. “Ordinary people,” wrote the scientist who conducted the experi-
      ment, “simply doing their jobs, and without any particular hostility on
      their part, can become agents in a terrible destructive process.” How
      many “ordinary” people have done terrible things throughout history, or
      even today? Too many have, for sure. Why? Christians know the answer.
      We are sinners, plain and simple.

Discussion Questions:
        What does the story of Josiah’s reform tell us about the impor-
       tance of the Word of God in our lives?

        A valid question could be raised now: If it were too late to
       avoid the coming catastrophe, why the call for repentance and
       revival and reformation? What was the purpose of it all? What
       answer would you give? In what ways might the reason be found
       in how such a revival would impact the people individually, as
       opposed to the nation as a whole?

                                                    Story
God’s Saving Hand: Part 1
   Wesley Banda pastored several villages in Malawi. The family lived in a
two-room house. Because the area had no electricity, Mrs. Banda prepared the
family meals outside over an open fire.
   One evening after dinner, Mrs. Banda returned to her fire to prepare the
morning meal of sadza (a thick porridge of cornmeal). Her husband sat in the
family’s front room, working on some papers. The children sat quietly waiting
for family devotions, but five-year-old Joshua had fallen asleep.
   As Pastor Banda lit the kerosene lamp, their only source of light, the flame
sputtered because the lamp was running low on fuel. He fetched the kerosene
and began refilling the tank. But unknown to him, the kerosene was contami-
nated with a small amount of gasoline. As he poured the fuel into the lamp’s
reservoir, the fumes caught fire, and the lamp exploded in his hands.
   Instinctively Pastor Banda threw the lamp across the room, but his clothes
had caught fire. Mrs. Banda saw her husband run out the door, his clothes
aflame. She immediately threw a pan of water onto his burning clothes while
he rolled on the ground. Soon the fire was out.
   The children ran out of the house, screaming, “Fire! Fire!” The burning fuel
had set the front room ablaze. In the excitement, nobody noticed that little
Joshua was missing. Moments later Mrs. Banda looked at the doorway and
saw Joshua crawling out of the house; his clothes were burning. She shrieked
and grabbed her youngest child and dropped him into a pan of water. The fire
hissed and went out, but Joshua was terribly burned.
   Their village had no clinic or hospital; so, a neighbor ran to the house of a
farmer who had a car. They banged on his door and begged for his immediate
help. He rushed over to drive the Bandas to the nearest hospital. Even so, it
was nearly midnight when the family entered the hospital emergency room. It
had been more than four hours since the explosion.
   The doctors shook their heads as they looked at the burns that the pastor
and his son had suffered. Pastor Banda’s burns were serious, but little Joshua
was injured even more seriously. Terrible burns covered his legs, stomach,
and chest. Every movement brought screams of pain from the little boy. Even
while the doctors worked to save the father and son some of the doctors tried
to prepare the family for the likelihood that Joshua wouldn’t survive.
   “We’re doing everything we can for your son,” the doctor said gently. “But
he is so badly burned that it would be a blessing if he died.”
   “No!” Mrs. Banda said firmly. “God has saved his life. Do what you must,
but God will save my son.”

      Jeremiah’s Yoke




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Jer. 16:1–13; Hos. 1:1–3; Jer.
      27:1–18; Dan. 4:25; Jeremiah 28; 2 Tim. 4:3, 4.

Memory Text: “And he said to them all, If any man will come after
      me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me”
      (Luke 9:23).



      A
              s we have already seen, God’s prophets preached not only
              through words but also through object lessons. At times the
              prophets had to live out the messages; it was another way to get
      the point across.
         Thus, Jeremiah again was called to “live out” the words he was to
      deliver. First, he had to wear a wooden yoke. “Thus saith the Lord
      to me; make thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy neck” (Jer.
      27:2). That must have been a burdensome task, even under the best of
      circumstances; in this case, it became harder because a false prophet
      challenged what Jeremiah said. This week we will get a powerful look
      at truth and error contending for the hearts and minds of the people.
      We will see, too, how a message of grace can also be a false message.
         Jeremiah also was forbidden to enter into mourning when others
      mourned and rejoicing when others rejoiced. In these cases, the point
      was to help the people realize what was coming because of their sins,
      and so to repent and obey, lessening the doleful consequence of their
      sinful actions.

     A Solitary Life
       No question, Jeremiah’s lot in life wasn’t an easy one (he would be
     the first to admit it too!). Things, though, were even harder than we
     might have imagined.

Read Jeremiah 16:1–13. What was the Lord’s message to Jeremiah here?
     However harsh, in what ways would it have been a blessing to the
     prophet? (Compare with Hos. 1:1–3.)
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        In contrast to Hosea, who was to marry a harlot in order to show just
     how corrupt the relationship had become between the Lord and Israel
     because of the nation’s spiritual harlotry, Jeremiah was to refrain from
     marriage and from having children altogether. This was something
     rather rare and extreme for that time and culture. In Israel, starting a
     family was very important for every young man. Besides the love and
     companionship between spouses, it was also important to carry on the
     family name. Why did God forbid Jeremiah from starting a family? It
     was so that his own life would be an object lesson on how terrible that
     time would be when families broke up and when the pain of separation
     became a heavy burden on the survivors. Jeremiah’s lack of family life
     was a constant warning and lesson for his contemporaries.
       Jeremiah’s solitary lot extended into other areas as well. He was for-
     bidden to enter a house where there was mourning; this would symbol-
     ize the people’s unwillingness to respond to God’s calls for repentance
     and revival.
       Along with times of mourning, he was not to join their festivals of
     joy and celebration. This was to symbolize the coming time when the
     Babylonians would bring an end to all of their joy and rejoicing.
       In these ways, the human bonds that are forged, whether in mourning
     or joy, would be denied Jeremiah. His life and the sorrows of his life
     were to be object lessons. If only the nation would learn from them!

      How should this account help us learn to appreciate the human
      support that we enjoy getting from others, or that we give to
      others? However important this support, how can we learn that,
      ultimately, our best support comes only from the Lord?

      Jeremiah’s Yoke
Read Jeremiah 27:1–18. What is the message of the Lord to the peo-
      ple? Why would this seem treasonous to many who heard it?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        The yoke Jeremiah had to put on his body was an unmistakable
      sign of the humiliation that the nation suffered; it’s what we call a
      military occupation. (In Deuteronomy 28:48 and 1 Kings 12:4, the
      idea of a yoke appears as an expression of oppression.) Jeremiah had
      to experience physically what the Babylonian invasion meant. The
      wooden yoke Jeremiah put on his arms and shoulders was one and a
      half meters long and eight centimeters thick. The essence of his mes-
      sage was that if a country revolted against Babylon, the Lord would
      take it as if the country had revolted against Him, and the rebellious
      would suffer as a result.
        Though there is some ambiguity in the original texts, it seems that
      Jeremiah not only had to make a yoke for himself but also make yokes
      for the envoys of foreign countries who had come to Jerusalem and
      were plotting against Nebuchadnezzar—despite the Lord’s warnings
      not 10. The natural response would be to fight against a foreign invader,
      which is what they wanted to do. No doubt, then, Jeremiah’s words
      were not at all welcome.

What is especially important about the message in Jeremiah 27:5? (See
     also Dan. 4:25.)
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         Here again, as we find all through both the Old and New Testaments,
      the Lord as Creator is Sovereign over all the earth. Even amid what
      appears to be chaos and catastrophe (invasion and dominion by a pagan
      nation), the power and authority of God are revealed, and this was, and
      is, to be a source of hope to all in the faithful remnant.

       It’s one thing to be under a yoke of bondage. However, ask your-
       self: Have you placed someone else under an unfair yoke, and if
       so, why not remove it now?

     War of the Prophets
       Bad news is bad news, and often we don’t want to hear it, or we want
     to rationalize it away. Such was the case here in Judah with Jeremiah
     and the yoke that he bore, an unmistakable message of warning to the
     people. “The amazement of the assembled council of nations knew no
     bounds when Jeremiah, carrying the yoke of subjection about his neck,
     made known to them the will of God.”—Ellen G. White, Prophets and
     Kings, p. 444.

Read Jeremiah 28:1–9. Imagine you are a Judean standing there and
     watching all this going on. Whom would you believe? Whom would
     you want to believe? What reason would you have, if any, for believ-
     ing Hananiah rather than Jeremiah?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Jeremiah raised his voice in the name of God, and Hananiah spoke
     in the name of God too. But who was speaking for God? They both
     couldn’t be! For us today, the answer is obvious. For someone at that
     time, it might have been more difficult, even though Jeremiah does
     make a powerful point in verses 8, 9: the prophets in the past have
     preached the same message that I am, that of judgment and doom.
       “Jeremiah, in the presence of the priests and people, earnestly
     entreated them to submit to the king of Babylon for the time the
     Lord had specified. He cited the men of Judah to the prophecies
     of Hosea, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, and others whose messages of
     reproof and warning had been similar to his own. He referred them
     to events which had taken place in fulfillment of prophecies of ret-
     ribution for unrepented sin. In the past the judgments of God had
     been visited upon the impenitent in exact fulfillment of His purpose
     as revealed through His messengers.”—Ellen G. White, Prophets
     and Kings, p. 445.
        In short, just as we today are to learn lessons from sacred history,
     Jeremiah was seeking to get the people in his time to do the same thing:
     learn from the past so you don’t make the same errors that your fore-
     fathers did. If it had been hard for them to listen to him before, now
     with the “ministry” of Hananiah there to counter him, Jeremiah’s task
     was going to be that much more difficult.

      Hananiah, whose name means “God has been gracious,” seemed
      to be presenting a message of grace, of forgiveness, of salvation.
      What lessons should we learn from this false preacher of grace?
                                                                          75

     The Yoke of Iron
       The battle between the prophets wasn’t just one of words, but of
     deeds as well. In obedience to the command of God, Jeremiah put the
     wooden yoke around his neck; this was an overt symbol of the message
     that he had carried to the people.

What was the prophetic symbolism of Hananiah’s act? Jer. 28:1–11.
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Imagine, for example, that after Jesus cursed the fig tree (Mark
     11:13, 19–21), someone who had heard what Jesus said and knew what
     had happened had planted a new fig tree in the same spot, all in an
     attempt to refute the prophecy of Jesus there. This is what Hananiah did
     with Jeremiah and the prophecy that the yoke around his neck symbol-
     ized. It was an act of open defiance of what Jeremiah said.
        Note, too, Jeremiah’s reaction. The texts record nothing of what he
     said right after the yoke was broken. He just turned around and walked
     away. If the story ended there, it would have seemed that the prophet
     had retreated in defeat.

Read Jeremiah 28:12–14. What happened next? What was Jeremiah’s
     new message?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Jeremiah’s response wasn’t a message of revenge: you did this to me,
     so I will do that to you. Instead, it was another clear message from the
     Lord but even stronger than what came before. Hananiah might have
     been able to break a wooden yoke, but who can break an iron one? In a
     sense, what the Lord said was that by the people’s obstinacy and refusal
     to obey they only were making matters worse. If you thought a wooden
     yoke was bad, try an iron one.

      Who hasn’t learned the hard way about making things more dif-
      ficult for ourselves by obstinacy? When dealing with the Lord,
      why is it always better to submit and surrender right away than
      to keep on fighting and making things harder on yourself?

     Trusting in Lies
      “Hear now, Hananiah; the Lord hath not sent thee; but thou
     makest this people to trust in a lie” (Jer. 28:15).

       The answer about who was right, whether Jeremiah or Hananiah,
     came soon enough. Jeremiah 28:16, 17 tells the fate of the false
     prophet, which was just what the true prophet had said it would be.
       Though Hananiah died, he still had done damage to the nation. His
     works, in a sense, followed him. He made the people “to trust in a lie.”
     The Hebrew verb is hiphil, a causative form of the verb “to trust.” He
     caused them to trust in a lie, not in the sense of physically forcing them,
     but through deception. Even though the Lord had not sent him, he spoke
     in the name of the Lord, which carried a lot of weight in Judah. Added
     to that, Hananiah’s message of “grace,” “deliverance,” and “redemption”
     was certainly something that the people wanted to hear, considering the
     great threat that Babylon posed to the nation. It was, though, a false
     “gospel,” a false message of salvation that the Lord had not given them.
     So, at a time when the people needed to hear the words of Jeremiah and
     the message of redemption that he brought, they listened to the words of
     Hananiah instead, and this made their woes only worse.

What do the following texts have in common with Jeremiah 28:15?

       Things are no different today: we are in the great controversy, a battle
     for the hearts and minds of the world’s billions. Satan is working dili-
     gently to get as many as possible to “trust in a lie,” and that lie can come
     in many guises and forms, just as long as it is always a lie. After all,
     because Jesus said “I am the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6),
     Satan’s lies can be about anything and everything, just as long as they
     don’t contain the truth as it is in Jesus.
      What are some of the lies that are prevalent in your culture
      today? Why is clinging to Jesus and His Word our only protection
      against them?

Further Thought: As we have seen, people want to believe good news,
     not bad. They wanted to believe, for instance, in Hananiah’s message,
     not Jeremiah’s. Today the same thing happens as well. Many still insist,
     for instance, that our world will only improve over time. Yet, even an
     atheist such as Terry Eagleton sees just how farcical that idea is: “If
     ever there was a pious myth and piece of credulous superstition, it is
     the liberal-rationalist belief that, a few hiccups apart, we are all steadily
     en route to a finer world. This brittle triumphalism is a hangover from
     the heroic epoch of liberalism, when the middle classes’ star was in the
     ascendant. Today, it sits cheek by jowl with the cynicism, skepticism, or
     nihilism into which much of that honorable lineage has degenerated.”
     —Reason, Faith, and Revolution: Reflections on the God Debate (Yale
     University Press, 2010), Kindle Edition, p. 70. Though some aspects of
     life have improved, our world, in and of itself, offers us little hope, little
     consolation, especially in the long run. If we are to have any real hope,
     it has to be in something divine, not earthly, in something supernatural,
     not natural. And of course, that’s what the gospel is all about: God’s
     divine and supernatural intervention in our world and our lives. Without
     that, what do we have other than just more Hananiahs and their lies?

Discussion Questions:
       Think about our earth’s future as a whole, even if from a
      purely human standpoint. Does it look hopeful and full of promise,
      or does it look fearful, dangerous, and full of uncertainty? What
      reasons can you give for your answers?

       Jeremiah’s message, as we saw in the context of Hananiah’s
      lies, was to look at the past, to look at history, and to learn from
      it. Ellen G. White wrote something similar: “We have nothing to
      fear for the future, except as we shall forget the way the Lord has
      led us, and His teaching in our past history.”—Life Sketches, p. 196.
      What does she mean by that? What has happened in our past, and
      God’s teaching in it, that can help us be prepared for what will
      undoubtedly come in the future?

       Hananiah gave a false message of grace. What are some of
      those false messages of grace today that we must guard ourselves
      against? Grace, of course, is our only hope, but in what ways can
      it be presented as a lie?

God’s Saving Hand: Part 2
   The burn treatment was very painful. Every day nurses removed the ban-
dages and soaked the burns in saltwater. Then they gently scraped the burns to
remove the dead skin to prevent infection. The nurses taught Mrs. Banda how
to wash the wounds and apply the medicine. She stayed in the hospital with
her husband and son to help care for them.
   After two long months, Pastor Banda insisted that he must return home. He
could barely walk, but he was concerned about his church members.
   Joshua and his mother remained in the hospital for four more months.
Every day his mother talked gently to him as she cleaned and dressed his
wounds. Her presence strengthened the boy and gave him hope.
   It was difficult for the family to be separated for so many months. They
couldn’t visit one another, but they could pray.
   After six months, Joshua was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital for
another three months of physical therapy. He couldn’t walk, but he learned
to shuffle along behind a walker. His mother began a new routine of daily
therapy. She soaked his legs in warm water then stretched the muscles in his
legs. It was painful, but she urged Joshua to sing instead of cry.
   At last Joshua was able to go home, but his mother continued treating him
and encouraged him to walk. After a year of recovery and therapy, Joshua was
able to walk without help.
   Pastor Banda’s recovery took a long time too. His damaged leg muscles
would not stretch enough to allow him to ride a bicycle. And this made it very
difficult for him to get from one church to another in the countryside. But his
churches continued to grow in size and in faith.
   Pastor Banda knows that throughout their ordeal God was beside each
member of the family, encouraging, blessing, and healing. “God was blessing
us even during our most difficult hour,” he says. “When I returned to work
from the hospital, the church prospered even more, and more people came
into the church than had been coming before the fire.”
   Mrs. Banda is also grateful for God’s blessings during the terrible ordeal.
“I thank God for saving my husband and son,” she says. “This experience
taught me the importance of spending more time with my family. I had failed
to notice some special qualities in little Joshua that I saw when he was in the
hospital. For example, he has a wonderful talent for singing that I did not
fully realize until I heard him singing while he was confined to his bed in the
hospital. During our long hospital stay, we had time to become good friends
with each other and with God.”

an ordained minister working in Malawi. While at Solusi, Oliva Banda also

      The Destruction of
      Jerusalem


      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Ezekiel 8, Rom. 1:22–25, Jer.
      37:1–10, 38:1–6, Jer. 29:1–14, Dan. 9:2.

Memory Text: “Also, seek the peace and prosperity of the city to
      which I have carried you into exile. Pray to the Lord for it, because
      if it prospers, you too will prosper” (Jeremiah 29:7, NIV).

                 ithin a few short years the king of Babylon was to be used
                 as the instrument of God’s wrath upon impenitent Judah.
                 Again and again Jerusalem was to be invested [surrounded]
      and entered by the besieging armies of Nebuchadnezzar. Company
      after company—at first a few only, but later on thousands and tens of
      thousands—were to be taken captive to the land of Shinar, there to
      dwell in enforced exile. Jehoiakim, Jehoiachin, Zedekiah—all these
      Jewish kings were in turn to become vassals of the Babylonian ruler,
      and all in turn were to rebel. Severer and yet more severe chastise-
      ments were to be inflicted upon the rebellious nation, until at last the
      entire land was to become a desolation, Jerusalem was to be laid waste
      and burned with fire, the temple that Solomon had built was to be
      destroyed, and the kingdom of Judah was to fall, never again to occupy
      its former position among the nations of earth.”—Ellen G. White,
      Prophets and Kings, pp. 422, 423.
         As we have seen, and will see, none of this came upon them without
      plenty of warnings and pleadings by the prophets, especially Jeremiah.
      Their refusal to obey brought only ruin. May we learn from their mis-
      takes!

     Weeping for Tammuz
        Though Jeremiah might have felt very much alone at times, he
     wasn’t. God had raised up Ezekiel, a contemporary, among the cap-
     tives in Babylon, in order to comfort and to warn the exiles as well as
     to confirm what the Lord had been speaking through Jeremiah all these
     long and hard years. Through his ministry, Ezekiel was to warn the
     captives against the folly of believing the false predictions of an early
     return from Babylon. He was also to foretell, by various symbols and
     messages, the devastating siege that would eventually befall Jerusalem
     because of the people’s refusal to repent and turn away from their sin
     and apostasy.

Read Ezekiel 8. What was the prophet shown? What does this tell us
     about how powerful the prevailing culture can be, and how it can
     impact even the most sacred things? What warnings should be here
     for us?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        No matter how often, and clearly, the writings of Moses and the
     prophets warned against idolatry and worshiping other gods, these
     verses show that this is exactly what was being done, even within the
     sacred precincts of the temple. “Weeping for Tammuz” was a lamen-
     tation ritual for a Mesopotamian god. No wonder 2 Chronicles said:
     “Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people, transgressed
     very much after all the abominations of the heathen; and polluted the
     house of the Lord which he had hallowed in Jerusalem” (2 Chron.
     36:14).
        Look carefully at Ezekiel 8:12. The translation about the chambers of
     their own “imagery” is a little ambiguous. It could mean the chambers
     where they stored their own idols, or it could mean the chambers of
     their own imagination, their own hearts. Either way, the elders, the lead-
     ers, had fallen so far that they said the Lord didn’t see what they were
     doing, that the Lord had abandoned them. It is another way of saying,
     “The Lord doesn’t care about these things; they aren’t important.” Right
     there, in the sacred precincts of God’s temple, these people engaged
     in the grossest idolatry, doing everything that they had specifically
     been forbidden by God’s word to do. Even worse, in their own minds
     they justified their deeds. Here we see again what Paul meant when he
     talked about those who worshiped the creation instead of the Creator
     (see Rom. 1:22–25).

                                                                            81

     The Unhappy Reign of King Zedekiah
        Zedekiah, whose name means “righteousness of Yahweh,” was
     the last king on the throne of Judah before its destruction by the
     Babylonians in 586 b.c. At first he seemed to have been willing to obey
     the words of Jeremiah and submit to the Babylonians. However, this
     attitude did not last.

Read Jeremiah 37:1–10. What was Jeremiah’s warning to King
     Zedekiah?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Under pressure from his subjects, most likely the nobility, Zedekiah
     ignored the warnings of Jeremiah and made a military alliance with the
     Egyptians instead, in hopes of staving off the Babylonian threat. (See
     Ezek. 17:15–18.) As he had been duly warned, salvation didn’t come
     from the Egyptians after all.

Read Jeremiah 38:1–6. What happened to Jeremiah (again) because
     he proclaimed the word of God to the people?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        As Jesus said, “A prophet is not without honour, but in his own coun-
     try, and among his own kin, and in his own house” (Mark 6:4). Poor
     Jeremiah again faced the wrath of his own countrymen. Like the rest of
     the nation, though, Jeremiah couldn’t say that he hadn’t been warned.
     In this case though, the warning was about the trials that he would face
     if he stayed faithful, which he did!
        How difficult it must have been for Jeremiah, too, because he was
     accused of weakening the morale of the nation. After all, when the
     people were facing an enemy from without, whom they wanted to fight
     against, and Jeremiah had been going around for years and years say-
     ing it’s a lost cause, that they couldn’t win, and that even the Lord was
     against them—it’s understandable that you would want to shut him up.
     So hardened in sin, they didn’t hear the voice of the Lord talking to
     them; indeed, they thought it was the voice of an enemy instead.

      However difficult the pit was, think about how much harder it
      was for Jeremiah to hear the charge against him that he was
      seeking the hurt, not the welfare, of his own people. What’s it like
      to be accused of hurting the very ones you are trying to help?

     The Fall of Jerusalem
        The siege of Jerusalem began in earnest in January, 588 b.c., and
     lasted until the late summer of 586 b.c. Jerusalem had been able to hold
     out for more than two years before Jeremiah’s prophetic words were ful-
     filled, and the Babylonian troops broke through the wall and destroyed
     the city. Starvation was so bad inside the walls that the defenders lost
     all strength and couldn’t resist any longer. King Zedekiah fled with his
     family, but in vain. He was captured and taken to Nebuchadnezzar, who
     had his sons executed before his eyes. We can read much of this sad
     story in Jeremiah 39:1–10.

Read Jeremiah 40:1–6. What is the significance of the words of
     Nebuzaradan to Jeremiah?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        How fascinating that this pagan commander understood the situa-
     tion so much better than did Jeremiah’s own people! Obviously the
     Babylonians knew something about Jeremiah and his work, and they
     were treating him differently from the way they did the others, such as
     Zedekiah (see Jer. 39:11, 12). Just why this pagan leader attributed the
     demise of Jerusalem to the Lord as a punishment for the sins of the
     people rather than to the superiority of his own gods over Judah’s, the
     text doesn’t say. Whatever the reason, it’s a startling testimony to how,
     even amid such unnecessary calamity, the Lord had revealed something
     about Himself to the pagans.
        What choice would Jeremiah make—go with the captives to
     Babylon, or stay behind with those remaining? Neither prospect would
     be particularly appealing, considering the circumstances for them all.
     Certainly, though, the spiritual needs of both groups would have been
     great, and Jeremiah could minister wherever he went. Jeremiah decided
     to stay among the group that remained behind in the land, with the poor
     people who no doubt were going to need all the encouragement and
     help that they could get (see Jer. 40:6, 7).

      How can you learn to minister to others, regardless of the situa-
      tion you are in? Why is it important, even for yourself, that you
      minister in whatever way you can?

     All Your Heart
       “You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your
     heart” (Jer. 29:13, NIV). What has been your own experience with this
     promise? What does “with all your heart” mean?

       The Lord knows the beginning from the end. Even while people
     in Jerusalem were still fighting the Babylonians, still hoping that the
     words of the false prophets were true, the Lord was using Jeremiah to
     speak to the future, to speak to those who were already in Babylon and
     to those who would eventually be there. And what words he spoke!

Read Jeremiah 29:1–14. How are the love and mercy of God revealed
     in these texts?

       Here was a true message of grace, unlike the false message of “grace”
     that the people had heard from the prophets who told them that their exile
     would be over in short order, even just two years. That was not God’s plan,
     and it was not going to happen. Instead, based on the clear teachings of
     Moses, they had to accept that this was their fate, at least for now; but just
     as Moses had said, if they repented, they would be restored to the land.

Read Deuteronomy 30:1–4. How do these texts reflect what Jeremiah
     said to the people? (See also Deut. 4:29.)

      The Seventy Years
         Jeremiah’s prophecies should have had a double effect on the think-
      ing of the captives: on the one hand they should not believe what the
      false prophets were saying, and on the other hand they should not be
      dispirited. He asked his captive countrymen to pray for Babylon. This
      request might have surprised those who had been deported. What
      Jeremiah was asking from the captives was unheard of in the earlier
      history of Israel. It had been absolutely unknown to pray for an enemy
      who had done what the Babylonians had done to them, God’s chosen
      nation. The prophet broke all their understandings regarding the temple
      and Jerusalem; they could pray in a pagan country, and the Everlasting
      God would listen to them.
         Notice, too, what Jeremiah says in Jeremiah 29:7: that the prosper-
      ity of their “host” nation will mean their prosperity too. As aliens and
      strangers in the land, they were especially vulnerable if things went
      badly in the nation in general. All through history, we have seen sad
      examples of intolerance becoming especially bad when a nation faces
      hard times; people look for scapegoats, those whom they can blame,
      and minorities, or aliens, often become easy targets. It is an unfortunate
      reality.

What wonderful hope is given to the exiles in Jeremiah 29:10? (See also
      Jer. 25:11, 12; 2 Chron. 36:21; Dan. 9:2.)
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        Everything the Lord had said would happen had happened; so, they
      had every reason to trust that He would fulfill this prophecy as well
      (Jer. 29:10). Why 70 years would be the exact time of their exile we
      don’t know, though it clearly is linked to the idea of Sabbath rest for
      the land (see Lev. 25:4, 26:34, 43). What’s so important about this
      prophecy is that, if they had taken in the concepts of faith and submis-
      sion, it would have given the captives great hope and assurance of the
      Lord’s complete sovereignty. Despite appearances, despite the terrible
      calamity that befell them, they could know that all was not lost, and the
      Lord had not left them. They were still the covenant people, and the
      Lord wasn’t through with them or the nation of Israel. Redemption was
      available there for all of those ready to meet the conditions.

       What prophecies give you great hope for the future? Which ones
       strengthen your faith and help you learn to trust the Lord for
       whatever will come?

Further Thought: “We are in continual danger of getting above the sim-
      plicity of the gospel. There is an intense desire on the part of many to startle
      the world with something original, that shall lift the people into a state
      of spiritual ecstasy, and change the present order of experience. There is
      certainly great need of a change in the present order of experience; for the
      sacredness of present truth is not realized as it should be, but the change we
      need is a change of heart, and can only be obtained by seeking God indi-
      vidually for His blessing, by pleading with Him for His power, by fervently
      praying that His grace may come upon us, and that our characters may
      be transformed. This is the change we need today, and for the attainment
      of this experience we should exercise persevering energy and manifest
      heartfelt earnestness. We should ask with true sincerity, ‘What shall I do
      to be saved?’ We should know just what steps we are taking heavenward.”
      —Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 1, pp. 187, 188.

Discussion Questions:
        As we saw, Jeremiah told the people to “seek the Lord.” How
       do we do that? What if someone were to say to you, “I want to
       know God for myself; how do I find Him?” How would you reply?

        Dwell more on the idea of why, historically, the prophets had
       been so mistreated and misunderstood in their own time. What
       should and could this teach us about how we relate to the ministry
       of Ellen G. White? Think about her in the context of what Jesus
       said here: “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you
       hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the
       graves of the righteous. And you say, ‘If we had lived in the days
       of our ancestors, we would not have taken part with them in shed-
       ding the blood of the prophets.’ So you testify against yourselves
       that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets”
       (Matt. 23:29–31, NIV).

        Dwell more on the final question at the end of Thursday’s
       study. Many Bible prophecies have been fulfilled in the past, and
       from our perspective today we can see that they were fulfilled. In
       what way can these fulfillments help us to trust that the ones yet
       future to us will be fulfilled as well?

Cry of the Kalahari: Part 1
   Waves of heat danced above the burning sands. A tiny, black Bushman
strode purposefully eastward across the vast Kalahari Desert, glancing
frequently at a small gray cloud in the sky ahead. Sekoba was obeying
instructions given to him in a dream. An angel had directed him to look
for a man named William, who would teach him about the true God.
   As the wise men once followed a star, so Sekoba followed the cloud
until it stopped over a village. But when he told the inhabitants of the
village about his dream, they mocked and laughed at him. That night
the angel appeared again and told him to continue his eastward journey.
After traveling across the desert for nearly a month, Sekoba found Pastor
William Moyo, who had been prepared for his coming through a dream.
   For several weeks, Pastor William taught Sekoba about God. In turn
the Bushman told a marvelous story of God’s guidance. As a young man
he had felt a strong impression that he must learn to read and write; so,
now he was able to read Pastor William’s Bible for himself. Several years
earlier when hungry lions were killing many cattle, he felt impressed
that a higher power controlled the lions. When he prayed to this power,
the lions left the area. When he heard of Christianity and began seeking
God in earnest, an angel in a dream had led him to Pastor William.
   After Sekoba had learned the good news of the gospel, he took Pastor
William back with him to tell the rest of his family and prepare them for
baptism. And that is how, at a camp meeting in 1948, the first converts
among the Bushmen were baptized.
   The Bushmen are a short race, averaging about five feet in height,
who traditionally wander in small groups, gathering wild fruit and hunt-
ing. They are a nomadic people who have learned to survive in the harsh
desert region of Botswana.
   Botswana’s climate is generally arid; the Kalahari Desert, which cov-
ers the southwestern part of the country, receives less than nine inches
of rain a year.
   For many years, these Bushmen have had contact with Seventh-day
Adventists through the dedicated doctors at Kanye Hospital. In the next
Inside Story, Dr. K. Seligman tells of one encounter.

      The Covenant




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 9:1–17; 12:1–3; Gal. 3:6–9,
      15–18; Exodus 24; Jer. 31:31–34; 1 Cor. 11:24–26.

Memory Text: “ ‘The days are coming,’ declares the Lord, ‘when I will
      make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of
      Judah’ ” (Jeremiah 31:31, NIV).



      A
              lthough the Bible speaks of “covenants” in the plural (Rom. 9:4,
              Gal. 4:24), there is only one basic covenant, the covenant of
              grace, in which God bestows salvation upon fallen beings who
      claim it by faith. The idea of plural “covenants” arises from the various
      ways God has restated the essential covenant promise in order to meet
      the needs of His people in different times and settings.
        But whether it’s the Adamic covenant (Gen. 3:15), the Abrahamic
      covenant (Gen. 12:1–3, Gal. 3:6–9), the Sinaitic covenant (Exod. 20:2),
      the Davidic covenant (Ezek. 37:24–27), or the New Covenant (Jer.
      31:31–33), the idea is the same. The salvation God provides is a gift,
      unmerited and undeserved, and the human response to that gift—in a
      sense, humanity’s holding up its side of the deal—is faithfulness and
      obedience.
        The first mention of the New Covenant is in Jeremiah, in the context
      of Israel’s return from exile and the blessings that God would grant
      them. Even amid calamity and trouble, the Lord extends to His way-
      ward people the offer of hope and restoration.

     God’s Covenant With All Humanity
       We look at how bad the world is today; that is, we see all the evil in it,
     and yet God still bears with us. Thus, we can only imagine just how bad
     things must have been in order for the Lord to destroy the whole world
     with a flood. “God had given men His commandments as a rule of life,
     but His law was transgressed, and every conceivable sin was the result.
     The wickedness of men was open and daring, justice was trampled in
     the dust, and the cries of the oppressed reached unto heaven.”—Ellen G.
     White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 91.

Read Genesis 9:1–17. What covenant was made between God and
     humanity, and how does it reflect God’s grace toward the creation?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        The covenant God expressed to Noah was the most universal among
     the biblical covenants; it was with all humanity, and it included the
     animals and nature too (Gen. 9:12). Also, this was a one-sided arrange-
     ment: the Lord didn’t impose any requirements or stipulations upon
     those with whom He was establishing the covenant. He simply was
     not going to destroy the earth with water again, period. Unlike other
     covenants, nothing was conditional about it.
         God then sealed His covenant with a visible sign, that of a rainbow,
     which symbolizes the covenant promise that the earth will never be
     destroyed by a flood again. So, anytime we see a rainbow, the mere fact
     that we are here to see it is, in its own way, a vindication of this ancient
     covenant promise. (After all, if we had been wiped out in a universal
     flood, we wouldn’t be here to see the rainbow!) Amid the constant sin
     and evil here on earth, at times we are blessed with the beauty of the
     rainbow, a sign of God’s grace toward the whole world. We can look
     up at it and draw hope, not only from just how beautiful it is in and of
     itself, but also because we know that it’s a message from God, a mes-
     sage of His love toward our wretched planet.

      Dwell upon the grandeur and beauty of a rainbow. Especially in
      light of what the Bible tells us about the rainbow, in what ways
      can it draw us toward God, toward transcendence, toward some-
      thing greater than what this mere earth itself offers?
                                                                               _

     The Covenant With Abraham
Read Genesis 12:1–3, 15:1–5, 17:1–14. What do these texts tell us
     about what the Lord intended to do through the covenant He made
     with Abraham?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       The Abrahamic covenant of grace is fundamental to the entire course
     of salvation history. That’s why Paul used it to help explain the plan of
     salvation as it was fulfilled in Jesus Himself.

Read Galatians 3:6–9, 15–18. How does Paul connect the covenant made
     with Abraham to Jesus and to salvation by faith alone?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Through Abraham’s seed—referring not to his many descendants but
     in particular to one, Jesus (see Gal. 3:16), God would bless the entire
     world. All who would be a part of Abraham’s seed, which happens by
     faith in Christ (Gal. 3:29), would find that Abraham’s God would be
     their God as well. Even back then, Abraham “believed God, and it was
     accounted to him for righteousness” (Gal. 3:6). Abraham was no more
     saved by works than the thief on the cross was; it’s always and only
     God’s saving grace that brings salvation. Abraham fulfilled his end of
     the covenant promise. His obedience revealed the faith that took hold
     of the promise of salvation. His works didn’t justify him; instead, the
     works showed that he was already justified. That’s the essence of the
     covenant and how it is expressed in the life of faith (see Rom. 4:1–3).

      Dwell upon the great truth that your hope of salvation comes
      only from the righteousness of Jesus credited to you by faith.
      What great hope and joy can you derive from this wonderful
      provision made in your behalf?
                                                                            _

     The Covenant at Sinai
How was the covenant made between Israel and God at Mount Sinai?
     Exodus 24.
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Moses and some leaders went to Mount Sinai. These leaders included
     Aaron and his two sons, who represented the priests, and the 70 elders
     and leaders, who represented the nation. The men accompanying Moses
     had to stop from afar, but Moses was allowed to go up to where God
     appeared.
       Moses later returned and affirmed the covenant with the whole nation.
     He proclaimed what God had spoken to him, to which the nation
     answered with the following words: “All the words which the Lord has
     said we will do.” (See Exod. 24:3, NKJV.)
       Of course, as sacred history has shown and as our own experience
     often proves, it’s one thing to make the claim to be obedient; it’s quite
     another to reach out in faith and surrender in order to harness the divine
     power that gives us the grace to do what we say we will.

Read Hebrews 4:2. What does this verse say about Israel’s failure?
     How can we learn to avoid the same mistake?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Only by faith and by grasping the promises that come by faith can
     we be obedient, an obedience that is expressed by loyalty to God’s law.
     Obedience to the law was no more contrary to the everlasting covenant
     in Moses’ time than it is in ours. The common misperception about the
     law and the covenants, which usually arises from reading Paul, stems
     from a failure to take into account the context in which Paul was writ-
     ing, that of dealing with his Judaizing opponents. They wanted to make
     the law and obedience to it central to the faith; Paul, in contrast, wanted
     to make Christ and His righteousness the central component.

      How often have you said, “All that the Lord has told me, I will
      do,” only to fail to follow through? How does this unfortunate
      reality make the promise of grace so much more precious? What
      hope would you have without it?
                                                                              _

     The New Covenant: Part 1
Read Jeremiah 31:31–34. What do these texts mean both in their
     immediate context and in ours today?

        Jeremiah uttered these words amid the greatest crisis the people
     had yet faced: the coming Babylonian invasion, when the nation was
     threatened with all but certain extinction. Here again, however, as in
     other places, the Lord offered them hope, the promise that this was not
     going to be the ultimate end, and that they would have another chance
     to thrive in the presence of the Lord.
        So, the first promise of the “new covenant” found in the Bible is in
     the context of Israel’s eventual return from Babylonian exile and the
     blessing that God would grant to them upon that return. Just as the
     breaking of the covenant made at Sinai (Jer. 31:32) brought them into
     exile, so the remaking of this covenant would preserve them and their
     hope for the future. Like the Sinai covenant, the new covenant would be
     relational, and it would include the same law, the Ten Commandments,
     but now written not just on tablets of stone but in their minds and on
     their hearts, where it should have been all along.
        “The same law that was engraved upon the tables of stone is written
     by the Holy Spirit upon the tables of the heart. Instead of going about
     to establish our own righteousness, we accept the righteousness of
     Christ. His blood atones for our sins. His obedience is accepted for us.
     Then the heart renewed by the Holy Spirit will bring forth ‘the fruits
     of the Spirit.’ Through the grace of Christ we shall live in obedience
     to the law of God written upon our hearts. Having the Spirit of Christ,
     we shall walk even as He walked.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and
     Prophets, p. 372.
        Under the new covenant, their sins would be forgiven, they would
     know the Lord for themselves, and they would obey God’s law through
     the power of the Holy Spirit working in them. Old covenant in shadows
     and in symbols, new covenant in reality, salvation was always by faith,
     a faith that would reveal “the fruits of the Spirit.”

     The New Covenant: Part 2
       The prophecy of Jeremiah about the new covenant (Jer. 31:31–34)
     contains a double application: first, it refers to Israel’s return to God
     and His bringing them home; second, it refers to the work of Jesus
     the Messiah, whose death ratified the covenant and would change the
     relationship between humans and God. It’s in the New Covenant that
     we get the fullest expression of the plan of salvation, which before had
     been revealed only in shadows and types (Heb. 10:1).

Read Luke 22:20 and 1 Corinthians 11:24–26. How do these texts link
     back to Jeremiah’s prophecy?

        The broken body of Christ and His shed blood were revealed in

     of the vine represents the blood of Jesus shed on the cross, revealed
     in the New Testament. The work of Jesus did not begin with the New
     Testament; it embraced the Old, as well, and in the Communion service
     we can see the link that unites what Jesus has done all through salva-
     tion history.
        The bread and the juice, then, provide the shortest summary of that
     salvation history. Though they are just symbols, it is still through these
     symbols that we understand God’s incredible work in our behalf.
        The Communion service points not just to Christ’s death, but also
     to His return, without which His death would be all but meaningless.
     After all, what good would Christ’s first coming be without the second,
     when we are resurrected from the grave (1 Thess. 4:16, 1 Cor. 15:12–
     18)? Jesus established the link when He said, “But I say unto you, I will
     not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink
     it new with you in my Father’s kingdom” (Matt. 26:29). No question,
     Christ’s first coming is inseparably tied to His second. The first finds
     its ultimate fulfillment only in the second.

      Next time you partake of the communion service, think about
      Christ’s vow not to drink of the fruit of the vine until He does
      so with us in the kingdom of God. How does that make you feel?
      What does that say about the closeness that Christ seeks with us?
                                                                              _

                                                                              _
                                                                             93

Further Thought: As we saw, the Bible teaches that the rainbow is a
     sign of God’s covenantal promise never to destroy the earth by water
     again. Sure, thanks to science, we now know that a rainbow occurs when
     sunlight is both refracted and reflected in drops of water, dispersing the
     light at various angles. Light enters a raindrop at one point, is reflected
     off the back of that drop at another, and leaves at another, creating the
     colors that we see. Poet John Keats feared that science would “unweave
     a rainbow,” but even if we could parse, measure, predict, and quantify
     everything about a rainbow down to the innards of each photon and the
     underbelly of every quark, what would that prove other than that we
     understand better the natural laws God used to create the signs of this
     covenant promise? Science might one day be able to explain everything
     about how rainbows are made—even to 25 digits to the right of a decimal
     point—but it can never explain why they are made.
        We, though, know why. Because God created our world in such a way
     that when sunlight and mist are in right relationships to each other, the
     mist breaks up the light by refracting and reflecting it at different angles
     that create bands of electromagnetic waves, which, when reaching our
     eyes, imprint the image of rainbows in our minds. And He did it (the
     “why” that science can never explain) to remind us of His covenant
     promise that never again would He destroy the earth by water.

Discussion Questions:
       What are some other crucial truths revealed by the Bible that
      science can never teach us? In fact, could you argue that the most
      important things we know could never be revealed by science? If
      so, what truths would they be?

       In class, go over the crucial relationship between faith and
      works in the plan of salvation. That is, what is the role of faith, and
      what is the role of works, and how do they relate to the Christian
      experience?

       What does it mean to say that the law is engraved on our
      hearts? How does this idea show the perpetuity of the law, even
      under the New Covenant?

Cry of the Kalahari: Part 2
   The desert sun streamed down mercilessly as the little man crept
forward with his bow. From his thin, wrinkled appearance one might
suppose he was in his seventies, but his body was accustomed to the
scarcity of food and water, and his reflexes were lightning fast.
   Steeped in the accumulated wisdom of his ancestors, he cautiously
moved closer to the small herd of grazing buck.
   When he was close enough, he fitted a poisoned arrow to his bow,
aimed carefully, and let the arrow fly.
   It found its mark, but the buck’s hide was tough and the arrow didn’t
penetrate deeply. The buck looked around then charged the Bushman,
catching him on its terrible horns and tossing him until his intestines
hung out of his abdomen, now covered with sand and grit.
   After the buck left, the Bushman staggered to his feet and, clutch-
ing the dirty mass to himself, headed for the only help he knew—the
Seventh-day Adventist hospital miles away!
   He was barely conscious when he reached the hospital compound.
The horrified staff rushed him to the operating room, marveling at the
desperate stamina that had brought him there.
   The surgeon prayed earnestly as he cleansed the intestines, replaced
them in the abdominal cavity, and sutured the gaping wound closed. He
knew that only God could heal the Bushman.
   With careful nursing and much prayer, he eventually recovered and
returned to his family, leaving the hospital staff to wonder if he also had
learned of God’s love during his hospital stay.
   Several months later, a little man with a horrible scar on his abdomen
came to the hospital bringing a four-foot chain of beads, painstakingly
handcrafted with primitive tools, as his expression of gratitude to the
doctor who had saved his life.

      Back to Egypt




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Jer. 40:7–16, Jeremiah 41–43,
      Exod. 16:3, Num. 16:13, Jeremiah 44.

Memory Text: “ ‘May the Lord be a true and faithful witness
      against us if we do not act in accordance with everything the Lord
      your God sends you to tell us’ ” (Jeremiah 42:5, NIV).



      T
              his week’s lesson brings us toward the end of the saga of
              Jeremiah the prophet. However, this is not an “and they lived
              happily ever after” ending. In a sense, one could summarize
      this week’s study, and even a good portion of the book of Jeremiah, by
      saying that what we see here is an example of the limits of grace. That
      is, grace will not save those who utterly refuse to accept it. No matter
      how much the Lord spoke to them, offering them salvation, protection,
      redemption, peace, and prosperity, all but a tiny and faithful remnant
      scorned and rebuffed God’s offer.
         And what of Jeremiah? His was a life and work that from all human
      appearances seemed futile! The “weeping prophet” had plenty to weep
      about. Even after everything he warned about came to pass, the people
      still clung to their sins and paganism and rebellion, openly defying the
      prophet to his face and scorning the Word of the Lord to them.
         How we need to be careful ourselves. Grace is grace because it’s
      given to the undeserving, yes; but it’s not forced on anyone. We must
      be willing to accept it.

     Political Anarchy
       One would think that with the destruction of the city and the total
     defeat by the Babylonians, all the people would have learned their les-
     son. Unfortunately, not all did, and the drama wasn’t over yet.

Read Jeremiah 40:7–16. What message was given (again) to the peo-
     ple? What is the significance of the word remnant used in verse 11?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Despite the message of peace, and even the ensuing prosperity (see
     Jer. 40:12), not everyone was content with the status quo.

Read Jeremiah 41. What new problems would the “remnant” now face?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Though the reasons for the assassination weren’t given, the fact
     that it had been done by someone of the “royal family and of the
     officers of the king” (Jer. 41:1, NKJV) suggests that these elitists still
     had not accepted the idea that the chosen nation needed to submit to
     Babylonian rule. Because Gedaliah had been put on the throne by the
     king of Babylon (see Jer. 40:5), these people might have seen him as
     a treasonous puppet who was disloyal to the nation and who therefore
     had to be eliminated along with his court.
        As the chapter continues, we can see that this remnant now faced
     a new threat: fear of the Babylonians, who—perhaps not knowing
     the details of what happened—would seek revenge for the death of
     Gedaliah and the Babylonian soldiers (see Jer. 41:3).

      The sins of Ishmael and his men caused fear among those who
      had nothing to do with those sins. What should this tell us about
      how, by our disobedience, we can bring pain and suffering to
      others, even those who had nothing to do with our sins?
                                                                             _

     Seeking Divine Guidance
Read Jeremiah 42. What powerful message is found there, not just for
     them, but for anyone who seeks guidance from the Lord in prayer?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Fearful of the Babylonians, the people seek out Jeremiah and ask him
     to pray for them for divine guidance. They must have known by now
     that Jeremiah was indeed a prophet of God, and what he said when he
     spoke in the name of the Lord would come true.
       They also vowed they would do whatever God asked or commanded
     them to do. So, as we read, we see a people who seem to have learned
     their lesson, who want not only to know what God’s will is but, more
     important, to follow it. The words—“Whether it is pleasing or displeas-
     ing, we will obey the voice of the Lord our God to whom we send you,
     that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the Lord our
     God” (Jer. 42:6, NKJV)—were a powerful confession of faith. After all
     that had happened, it was about time.
       Notice the parallel here with Jeremiah’s earlier messages: don’t trust
     in foreign powers. Trust in the Lord, and He will prosper you and He
     will deliver you when the time is right. Salvation isn’t from anywhere or
     anyone else. The foreign powers didn’t help you before, and they won’t
     help you now.
       God has to warn them because He knows the tendency of their hearts:
     He knows that they are thinking of going back to Egypt (think of the
     symbolism here) in order to seek the protection they wanted. So, the
     Lord gave them very clear and specific commands not to do that, that
     such a course would bring ruin upon them.
       Again, such a stark choice, the choice we all have to face: life
     and peace through faith and obedience to Jesus, or misery and death
     through lack of faith and lack of obedience. No matter the different cir-
     cumstances, in the end the issue is the same for all of us. Unlike these
     people, we don’t always have the warnings given to us so specifically
     and so clearly expressed, but we have been given the warnings just the
     same.

      Life or death, blessing or cursing. What kind of choices are you
      making, every day, either for life or for death?
                                                                            _

      Returning to Egypt
        If you haven’t read ahead, Jeremiah 42 could be very exciting. What will
      the people do? Would they reach out in faith, a faith that is revealed in obedi-
      ence, and remain in Judah? Or would they make the same mistakes that were
      made in the past, and instead of following a clear “thus saith the Lord,” do
      what they want to do, despite the Lord’s clear warning in the last few verses
      of chapter 42 about what would await them if they did go back to Egypt?

Read Jeremiah 43:1–7. What did they do?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         When God’s Word does not agree with our intentions or desires, we
      tend to have doubts about its divine origins. Likewise, the people and
      the leaders had doubts about Jeremiah. Apparently, in Israel, only the
      circumstances had changed, but the people remained the same in their
      thinking and in their heart. They excused themselves from their vow by
      attacking the prophet Jeremiah. However, they did not want to attack
      the aged Jeremiah directly. So, they blamed Baruch, his friend and
      sometimes scribe, and turned their wrath against him, claiming that he
      had turned the prophet against them.

Read Exodus 16:3 and Numbers 16:13. What parallels exist between what
     the people said to Jeremiah and what their ancestors said to Moses?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         Human nature is human nature, always looking for someone else
      to blame for its problems, always looking for an excuse to do what it
      wants. Thus, for whatever reason, Baruch was accused of wanting all
      of his countrymen to die by the hand of the Babylonians or to be taken
      into exile there. Jeremiah 43:1–7 does not say why the people thought
      Baruch wanted this to happen, any more than Scripture explains why
      the children of Israel thought Moses wanted them to die in the wilder-
      ness after they had left Egypt. People in the thrall of emotions and
      passions may not have sound reasons for their thinking. How crucial it
      is, then, that we keep our passions and emotions submitted to the Lord!

       How often do we allow emotions or passions to cloud our judg-
       ment or even override a clear “thus saith the Lord”? How can
       we protect ourselves from letting emotions and passions get the
       better of us? (See 2 Cor. 10:5.)
                                                                                  99

      Taken Into Exile
Read Jeremiah 43:8–13. What did the Lord say through Jeremiah?
      _________________________________________________________
      _________________________________________________________
      _________________________________________________________

         Tahpanhes was a town at the northeastern border of Egypt, that
      had significant fortifications and where a great number of Jewish
      colonists lived.
         Here again, the Lord wants Jeremiah to act out a prophecy sym-
      bolically. Even though words are powerful, sometimes when things
      are done in real life, when they are acted out before us, the point
      comes through even more strongly.
         How exactly Jeremiah was to bury stones at the entrance to
      Pharaoh’s house, we aren’t told. The point, however, was clear: even
      the mighty pharaohs were no match for the Lord, and He would ful-
      fill His word just as He had said. The refugees who thought that they
      would find protection and safety by going to Egypt were as wrong as
      those who, as we saw earlier, thought that they could find protection
      and safety by having Egypt come to them (Jer. 37:7, 8). The Egyptian
      gods were useless, figments of warped imaginations; these gods were
      pagan abominations that kept the people in abject ignorance of truth.
      The Israelites should have known, as we should now know, that our
      only true protection and safety is in obeying the Lord.
         “When self-denial becomes a part of our religion, we shall under-
      stand and do the will of God; for our eyes will be anointed with
      eye-salve so that we shall behold wonderful things out of his law. We
      shall see the path of obedience as the only path of safety. God holds
      his people responsible in proportion as the light of truth is brought
      to their understanding. The claims of his law are just and reasonable,
      and through the grace of Christ he expects us to fulfill his require-
      ments.”—Ellen G. White, The Advent Review and Sabbath Herald,
      February 25, 1890.

       Think about the symbolism, too, in the Israelites’ going back to
       Egypt in their desire to find safety. How ironic! In a spiritual
       sense, what are ways that we could be tempted to “go back to
       Egypt” to find what we think we can’t find with the Lord?
                                                                          _

     Open Defiance
Read Jeremiah 44:1–10. What were the captives doing in Egypt?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       During the Egyptian captivity, Jeremiah had to face the same prob-
     lem he had while he and his people had lived in Judah. At that time he
     had to talk to the leaders; now he had to talk to the common people,
     who in captivity were committing some of the same sins that brought
     this devastation on them to begin with.

What startling answer did they give to Jeremiah when confronted by
     their sins? (Jer. 44:15–19).
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        The hardness of their hearts and the deception that had overtaken
     them are astonishing. Basically, they looked Jeremiah in the face and
     defied him and what he spoke to them in “the name of the Lord.”
        The rationale was simple: in the early days, before the reforms of
     Josiah, when they were heavily steeped in worshiping pagan gods, even
     burning incense to the “queen of heaven” and pouring out drink offer-
     ings to her, things went well for them. They were materially well off
     and dwelt in safety. However, it was only after the reforms of Josiah
     (which were too late) that calamity struck. So, why should they listen
     to Jeremiah and all his warnings?
        Jeremiah’s response (Jer. 44:20–30) was, No, you don’t understand.
     It was precisely because you did all these things that these calamities
     have come upon you. Worse, your stubborn refusal to change means
     that even more calamity will come, and the safety you thought you
     would find in Egypt is a deception and a lie, just like the pagan gods
     you worship. In the end, you will know the truth, but it will be too late.

      What about those who, steeped in sin and unbelief, seem to be
      doing very well, while at times faithful Christians go through
      terrible trials? How do we work our way through this reality?
                                                                             _

Further Thought: All through the book of Jeremiah, as through all the
      Bible, we are confronted with the question of good and evil. And
      as Christians we know good from evil, because God has defined
      these terms for us in many different ways. (See, for example, Rom.
      7:7, Mic. 6:8, Josh. 24:15, Matt. 22:37–39, Deut. 12:8.) But what if
      you don’t believe in God? How can you know good from evil? Well,
      atheist author Sam Harris has a suggestion. He wrote a book called
      The Moral Landscape, in which he argues that good and evil can
      and should be understood only in terms of science. That is, the same
      way that science has helped us understand the difference between the
      strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force, it should help us
      know right from wrong and good from evil. He even speculates that
      science might one day cure evil. “Consider what would happen if we
      discovered a cure for human evil. Imagine, for the sake of argument,
      that every relevant change in the human brain can be made cheaply,
      painlessly, and safely. The cure for psychopathy can be put directly
      into the food supply like vitamin D. Evil is now nothing more than
      a nutritional deficiency.”­—Sam Harris, The Moral Landscape: How
      Science Can Determine Human Values (New York: Simon & Schuster,
      Inc., 2010), Kindle Edition, p. 109. Most scientists, however, even
      those who don’t believe in God, would have a problem believing that
      science can solve these problems. If, however, you don’t believe in
      God, where else can you find these solutions?

Discussion Questions:
        “With us, everything depends on how we accept the Lord’s
       terms.”—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 118. Why
       is it a mistake to assume that salvation comes with no condition?
       Conditions are not the same things as works, or something that
       gives us merit before God. How can we learn to differentiate
       between the false teaching of salvation by works (legalism) and the
       false teaching that salvation is nonconditional (cheap grace)?

        Dwell more on the difficult question at the end of Thursday’s
       study. If someone says: “I don’t believe in Jesus, I don’t even
       believe in God, and yet look at how well my life is going. In fact,
       I would say that my life is going better than yours, and you are a
       Christian,” how would you respond?

All Things Work Together for

   Like many young people in Africa, Siyoka migrated from his village to a

could back to his widowed mother and two younger brothers.
   It was the music that first attracted him to the meetings held by Pastor
Mbena; but when he heard the story of Jesus, Siyoka kept thinking about
how wonderful it would be to go to heaven with Him, and to never be
hungry, sad, lonely, or afraid again!
   After the meetings, Siyoka returned home. Perhaps, someday, he could
become a pastor too. The local elder who was in charge of following up
with those who had attended the meetings thought Siyoka had lost interest
when he left town. But at home Siyoka did whatever work he could to pay
for his school fees, as well as care for the family garden. But that year the
rains did not come. Sadly the villagers watched their crops wither and die.
Sometimes there was a little rain but not the steady, soaking rains needed
to bring life to the barren earth.
   The famine was terrible. Many died and many more, including Siyoka,
became sick. In desperation, his mother, seeing he was about to die, man-
aged to bring him to a hospital in the nearest city. It was there that Pastor
Mbena, visiting some of his church members, found him.
   After relating these events, Siyoka’s thin face lit up as he said in a weak
whisper, “God is good, Pastor Mbena. He kept me from dying in the fam-
ine, and now I will be alive to see my people baptized. You will come to
my village, won’t you?”
   “Yes, Siyoka, I must come to your village and hold some meetings so
your people can learn about Jesus,” answered the pastor warmly.
   “Oh, they already know Jesus, Pastor!” Siyoka assured him earnestly.
“There are 25 ready to be baptized. I told them everything I learned when
I attended your meetings and taught them the songs too. I met with them
every Sabbath. Even when the famine was really bad we prayed, and God
answered our prayers. He brought me here so I could find you. When can
you come?”
   Pastor Mbena could hardly believe his ears. This boy who had had so
little opportunity to learn had become a preacher for God! When Siyoka
was well enough to go home, the pastor accompanied him. He visited the
people and found that they had indeed been well taught. What a wonderful
day it was when Siyoka and his 25 converts were baptized.

      Lessons From Jeremiah




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Jer. 2:13, 6:20, 7:1–10, Matt. 9:12,
      Deut. 6:5, Jer. 10:1–15, 23:1–8.

Memory Text: “ ‘Behold, the days are coming,’ says the Lord, ‘that I
      will raise to David a Branch of righteousness; a King shall reign
      and prosper, and execute judgment and righteousness in the
      earth’ ” (Jeremiah 23:5, NKJV).



      W
                  e’re now at the end of our study of Jeremiah. It’s been an
                  adventure; a lot of drama, emotion, and energy have been
                  expended in the saga of our prophet.
         Like all the prophets, Jeremiah didn’t write in a vacuum: his was a
      message from the Lord and for people at a specific time and place and
      under specific circumstances.
         And yet, however radically different his circumstances were from ours
      or from those of the many other generations who have read Jeremiah,
      crucial principles expressed there are the same for God’s people in every
      generation.
         Such as faithfulness to God and obedience to His commandments. Such
      as true religion, a religion of the heart, as opposed to empty and dead
      rituals that can leave people in a false state of complacency. Such as the
      people’s willingness to listen to correction, even when it cuts across what
      they want to hear. Such as true revival and reformation. Such as trusting in
      the Lord and His promises instead of the arm of flesh. Such as . . .
         The list goes on. This week, let’s take a look at some of the many lessons
      we can learn from this revelation of God’s love for His people even amid
      many thunderous warnings to them about where their actions will lead.

     Jeremiah’s Lord
        Seventh-day Adventists understand that at the center of the great con-
     troversy exists a crucial issue: What is the character of God? What is
     God really like? Is He the arbitrary tyrant that Satan makes Him out to
     be, or is He a loving and caring Father who wants only the best for us?
     These questions really are the most important questions in the entire
     cosmos. After all, what would our situation be if God were not kind and
     loving and self-sacrificial but mean and arbitrary and sadistic? We’d be
     better off if no God existed than to have one like that.
        So, the questions are of huge importance. Fortunately, we have the
     answers, and they are best seen at the Cross.
        “Never will it be forgotten that He whose power created and upheld
     the unnumbered worlds through the vast realms of space, the Beloved
     of God, the Majesty of heaven, He whom cherub and shining seraph
     delighted to adore—humbled Himself to uplift fallen man; that He
     bore the guilt and shame of sin, and the hiding of His Father’s face, till
     the woes of a lost world broke His heart, and crushed out His life on
     Calvary’s cross. That the Maker of all worlds, the Arbiter of all desti-
     nies, should lay aside His glory and humiliate Himself from love to man
     will ever excite the wonder and adoration of the universe.”—Ellen G.
     White, The Great Controversy, p. 651.

How are the nature and character of God revealed in the following
     texts in Jeremiah? That is, what do these texts tell us about Him?

     Jer. 2:13 __________________________________________________

     Jer. 5:22 __________________________________________________

     Jer. 11:22 _________________________________________________

     Jer. 31:3 __________________________________________________

     Jer. 3:7 ___________________________________________________

       These are just a few of the many images and expressions used in
     the book that reveal to us something of the nature and character of our
     God. He is the Source of life, the powerful Creator, a God of judgment,
     a God who loves us and calls us, again and again, to repent of our sins
     and to turn away from the paths that will lead to our destruction.

      What evidence of God’s loving character have you experienced
      during your lifetime?
                                                                             _

                                                                          105

      Rituals and Sin
        “There is a document that records God’s endless, dispiriting struggle
      with organized religion, known as the Bible.”—Terry Eagleton,
      Reason, Faith, and Revolution: Reflections on the God Debate (Yale
      Univeristy Press, 2010), Kindle Edition, p. 8.
        Not quite true, and that’s because the religion of the Bible, the religion
      that God has given humanity, has always been an “organized religion.”
        On the other hand, there is no question that in the book of Jeremiah,
      the Lord was seeking to get people away from the cold, dead, but very
      organized rituals that came to dominate their faith, rituals that they
      believed covered their sin.
        As said earlier, yet it is worth repeating, the vast majority of
      Jeremiah’s struggles were with leaders and priests and people who
      believed that because they were the chosen ones of God, the children
      of Abraham, the covenant people, they were just fine with the Lord.
      What a sad deception, one that we, also of Abraham’s seed (Gal. 3:29),
      need to watch out for.

What is the message of the following texts in Jeremiah? Most impor-
      tant, how can we apply the principles there in our own walk with
      the Lord? (Jer. 6:20, 7:1–10).
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         Read Jeremiah 7:9, 10. If one ever wanted to find a situation that
      fits what has been called “cheap grace,” the term certainly applies
      here. The people do all these sinful things and then come back to the
      temple and “worship” the true God and claim forgiveness for their
      sins. God is not mocked. Unless these people change their ways,
      especially how they treat the weak among them, they are going to
      face harsh judgment.
         What a deception they are under, the belief that they can claim God’s
      forgiveness and go on doing what they want, without regard to the
      conditions of the covenant so that they can continue on in those sins.

       What is the difference between what Jeremiah is warning about
       here and what Jesus said in Matthew 9:12? Why is it important
       to know that difference?
                                                                                _

     Religion of the Heart
       “So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God”
     (Rom. 14:12).

        So much of the book of Jeremiah is directed toward the nation as a
     whole. Time and again he talked about Israel and Judah corporately, as
     God’s “choice vine” (Jer. 2:21, NIV), or the “beloved” of the Lord (Jer.
     11:15, 12:7), God’s own “heritage” (Jer. 12:7–9), His “vineyard” (Jer.
     12:10), and His “flock” (Jer. 13:17). Without doubt, in the book we
     get a sense of the corporate nature of the Lord’s calling to this nation.
        Of course, it’s the same in the New Testament, where time and again
     the church is understood in a corporate sense (see Eph. 1:22, 3:10,
     5:27).
        Yet, salvation is personal, not a corporate issue. We are not saved as
     package deals. As with the New Testament church, the nation of Judah
     was composed of individuals, and it’s here, at the level of the individ-
     ual, that the real crucial issues arise. The famous text in Deuteronomy
     6:5, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all
     your soul, and with all your strength” (NKJV), though spoken to the
     nation as a whole, is written in the singular second person. That is, the
     “you” in each case is the singular; God is talking to each one individu-
     ally. In the end, each one of us, personally, will have to give an account
     of ourselves to God.
        We find that same thing in Jeremiah as well.

What do the following texts say about the importance of a personal,
     individual walk with the Lord?

     Jer. 17:7__________________________________________________

     Jer. 17:10_________________________________________________

     Jer. 29:13_________________________________________________

     Jer. 9:23, 24_______________________________________________

       Though both Testaments of the Bible talk about the corporate nature
     of God’s church, true faith is a matter of each person, himself or herself,
     making a daily surrender to the Lord, a personal choice to walk in faith
     and obedience.

      Though there’s no question that we are each individually respon-
      sible for our own souls, how can we make sure that we are doing
      everything we can to uplift and encourage others? Whom do you
      know, right now, that you can say some kind and uplifting words to?
                                                                           107

      Twilight of the Idols
What was one of the great sins that the people committed that
      Jeremiah had to deal with constantly? (Jer. 10:1–15).
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         What’s interesting in these texts is not just the way in which the
      prophet shows how vain and useless and silly these idols are but how he
      contrasts them to the living God. These things are powerless, useless,
      empty, and false; what a contrast to the Lord who made the heavens
      and earth! He will endure forever, while these idols will vanish forever.
      So, whom should we be worshiping and dedicating our lives to: that
      which is weak, false, vain, and powerless, or to the Lord, whose power
      and might are so great that He created and sustains the universe? The
      answer, of course, is obvious.
         Yet, however obvious the answer, the fact is, we are in danger of
      falling into idolatry as well. Though today we might not worship the
      same kind of idols that those in Jeremiah’s time did, our modern life
      is full of false gods. These modern idols can be anything that we love
      more than God; whatever we “worship” (and worship doesn’t always
      mean singing and praying) becomes our god, and we are guilty of
      idolatry.

What are some of the things that we can be in danger of making into
      idols? What about things such as digital devices, money, fame, even
      other people? Make a list of what these potential idols are, and then
      ask yourself: In the end, what real salvation do they offer?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        Of course, we know intellectually that none of these things is
      worthy of worship. We know that in the end, nothing that this world
      offers us, nothing that we make into idols, can ultimately satisfy
      our souls and certainly not redeem them. We know all these things,
      and yet, unless we are careful, unless we keep before us Jesus and
      what He did for us and why He did it, we can so easily be swept up
      in a modern form of the idolatry similar to that which Jeremiah so
      passionately railed against.

     The Remnant
       “In the closing years of Judah’s apostasy the exhortations of the
     prophets were seemingly of but little avail; and as the armies of the
     Chaldeans came for the third and last time to besiege Jerusalem,
     hope fled from every heart. Jeremiah predicted utter ruin; and it was
     because of his insistence on surrender that he had finally been thrown
     into prison. But God left not to hopeless despair the faithful remnant
     who were still in the city. Even while Jeremiah was kept under close
     surveillance by those who scorned his messages, there came to him
     fresh revelations concerning Heaven’s willingness to forgive and to
     save, which have been an unfailing source of comfort to the church
     of God from that day to this.”—Ellen G. White, Prophets and Kings,
     p. 466.
       Even amid that prevailing apostasy and doom, God always had a
     faithful people, however small in number. Though as with many of the
     books of the prophets, much of the emphasis in Jeremiah was on apos-
     tasy and unfaithfulness—because these were what the Lord wanted to
     save the people from—all through sacred history the Lord had a faith-
     ful remnant. This, of course, will continue down until the end of time
     (see Rev. 12:17).

How is the concept of the remnant expressed in Jeremiah 23:1–8? How
     does this apply to New Testament times? (See also Jer. 33:14–18.)
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       In verses 5–7 scholars have long seen a Messianic prophecy, a proph-
     ecy of redemption for God’s faithful people. Though it’s true that, after
     the Babylonian exile, a remnant returned, it was not a glorious return.
     However, God’s purposes would be fulfilled through the lineage of
     David, through a “righteous Branch,” the King who would one day
     reign.
       This prophecy had a partial fulfillment in the first coming of Jesus
     (see Matt. 1:1, 21:7–9, John 12:13). It will have its ultimate fulfillment
     in the Second Coming (see Dan. 7:13, 14), when all of God’s faithful
     people, His true remnant, will dwell forever in peace and safety. The
     redemption, first symbolized by the Exodus from Egypt, will be final,
     complete, and eternal.

      In what are you putting your hopes? How can you learn to trust
      more and more in the promises of God and their ultimate fulfill-
      ment in your own life? What else besides them do you have?
                                                                          109

Further Thought: Many years ago a Seventh-day Adventist minister
      named W. D. Frazee preached a sermon called “Winners and Losers.” In
      it he went through the lives of various Bible characters, looking at their
      work and ministry, and then he asked the question regarding each one:
      Was he a winner or a loser?
         For example, he looked at John the Baptist, who lived a lonely life in
      the wilderness. Though eventually John had a small following, it never
      amounted to much, and certainly it was not what Jesus, who came
      later, had. And, of course, John lived out his last days in a dank prison
      where, at times, he was harassed with doubt, finally only to get his
      head chopped off (Matthew 14). After recounting all this, Elder Frazee
      asked: “Was John a winner or a loser?”
         What about Jeremiah the prophet? How successful was his life? He
      suffered a great deal, and he wasn’t afraid to whine and moan about it
      either. With few exceptions, it seems that the priests, prophets, kings,
      and common people not only didn’t like what he had to say, but also
      thoroughly resented it. He was even seen as treasonous against his own
      people. In the end, the destruction and doom that he spent his life warn-
      ing about came, because time and again the people rejected his words.
      They threw him into a muddy pit, hoping he’d die there. He lived to
      see his nation go into a terrible exile while Jerusalem and the temple
      were destroyed. Thus, from a human perspective, not much went well
      for Jeremiah. From one perspective, you could argue that he had a fairly
      miserable life.


Discussion Questions:
        Was Jeremiah a winner or a loser? What are the reasons for
       the choice you make? If you say he was a winner, what does that
       tell us about how crucial it is that we not judge reality by the
       world’s standards? What standards are we to use to try to under-
       stand what is right and wrong, good and evil, success and failure?
        In what ways do we see the life and ministry of Jesus prefig-
       ured in Jeremiah? What are the parallels?
        Earlier this week we saw the problem of believing that going
       on with religious worship without a change of heart is a deception.
       What is true grace, in contrast to the cheap, worthless, and even
       deceptive version of it warned about here?

Now Is the Time
   Debrah, a Seventh-day Adventist, missed her church fellowship after
she married an unbeliever and moved with her husband to an area
where there was no church.
   After some years, a group of Adventist laymen calling themselves
the “Now Is the Time” team decided to hold meetings in this area. The
first night of the meetings, Debrah’s husband happened by and came
in. Although he was very drunk, he realized that these meetings were
being conducted by members of his wife’s church.
   “Where have you been?” he demanded loudly. “My wife is a Seventh-
day Adventist, and she has been waiting years for you to come!” One of
the workers persuaded him to come outside where his drunken behavior
would not interrupt the meeting. Finally, he asked for a Bible to take to
his wife and set off for home, some distance away.
   Meanwhile, Debrah had awakened from a vivid dream in which she
had seen her husband entering the house with a Bible as a gift for her.
She lay in the darkness, wondering what the dream meant. She knew
it was unlikely that her husband would spend his money to buy her a
Bible.
   About 2:00 a.m. her husband came home and presented her with the
Bible, just as she had dreamed. Thrilled over this sign of God’s care,
she couldn’t go to sleep and finally decided to get up and find the place
where the meetings were being held.
   Arriving very early in the morning, Debrah found the preachers and
studied earnestly with them. She decided that nothing would keep her
from serving the God who had spoken to her in a dream.
   Debrah’s husband was tolerant, but his parents were angry. They
burned all of her clothes. When the evangelistic team gave her more
clothes, they burned them too. When her husband’s parents realized
that she would not forsake her religion, they threw Debrah out of the
home and bought another wife for their son. But eventually, because
of his unhappiness, they relented and reinstated Debrah as their son’s
wife.
   Although her husband was glad to have her back, he showed no
interest in religion himself. But as Debrah worked hard to please him
and make him comfortable, while also spending as much time as she
could helping others, her beautiful Christian life made an impression on
him, and he decided to become a Seventh-day Adventist. Today, he and
Debrah work together to share God’s love.

  Debrah and her husband live in an unspecified country in Africa.

2016
          Creation was “blessed” by God. The great controversy came to earth
       when Satan deceived Adam and Eve and diverted their allegiance from
       God to himself. Had Adam and Eve stayed faithful to God’s commands,
       trials and suffering never would have arisen on our planet.
          God pledged to bear in Himself the full responsibility for all human
       rebellion and to suffer the consequences for every evil we have com-
       mitted. This is the only way God could restore His relationship with us
       as well as the relationships between humans, and humanity’s relation-
       ship with the rest of creation.
          It is in this context that we see Satan’s passion to deface creation and to
       obliterate God’s people. His strategies are revealed in the Bible, and God
       is constantly defeating Satan’s purposes throughout Scripture.
          Jesus won at the cross. The challenge always has been where we
       place our loyalty. The choice should be easy, but the battle for our
       hearts and minds continues. Our prayer is that these lessons, entitled
       Rebellion and Redemption by David Tasker, will reveal some of these
       deceptions and help us to choose Christ and to remain in Him.

Lesson 1—Crisis in Heaven
       The Week at a Glance:
       Sunday: The Fall in Heaven (Isa. 14:4, 12–15)
       Monday: The Prince of This World (John 12:31)
       Tuesday: War in Heaven (Rev. 12:7–13)
       Wednesday: Satan Evicted (John 12:31)
       Thursday: The Continuing Battle (John 16:33)
       Memory Text—Revelation 7:10, NKJV
       Sabbath Gem: Lucifer’s lust for power resulted in a “war in
       heaven” (Rev. 12:7). By deceiving Adam and Eve, Satan brought war
       to earth, and we have been dealing with the consequences ever since.
       God’s plan of salvation is His way of restoring order and harmony.

Lesson 2—Crisis in Eden
       The Week at a Glance:
       Sunday: Three Blessings (Gen. 1:22, 28, 2:3)
       Monday: The Test at the Tree (Gen. 2:15–17)
       Tuesday: The Fall: Part 1 (Gen. 3:1–5)
       Wednesday: The Fall: Part 2 (Gen. 3:6–7)
       Thursday: The Consequences (Gen. 3:10–19)
       Memory Text—Genesis 3:15, NKJV
       Sabbath Gem: The story of the Fall remains a powerful reminder
       that our only safety exists not only in believing what God tells us but,
       more important, in obeying what He tells us as well.
