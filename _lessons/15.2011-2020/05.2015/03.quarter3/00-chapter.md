The Great Commission

A
          nd Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, ‘All authority has been given to Me
          in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations,
          baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am
with you always, even to the end of the age’ ” (Matt. 28:18–20, NKJV).
   How much plainer could it be? Here is Jesus, the resurrected Jesus, the Jesus whom
they worshiped (vs. 17), giving His people, in even the earliest days of the church, their
calling and mission: make disciples in every nation of the world. Period.
   It’s not hard, either, to see the link between these words, spoken to the eleven in
Galilee, and the words spoken to John on the island of Patmos years later: “Then I
saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach
to those who dwell on the earth—to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people—saying
with a loud voice, ‘Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has
come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water’ ”
(Rev. 14:6, 7, NKJV; see also vss. 8–12).
   One could say that the three angels’ messages of Revelation 14 are the Great
Commission contextualized for the last days of earth’s history.
   No question: God has told His church, His people, to reach out and spread the gos-
pel to the entire world. It’s what we have been called to do. Spreading the truth about
Jesus and what He has done for us (John 3:16), what He is doing now for us (Rom.


2
8:34), and what He will do for us in the future (1 Thess. 4:16) is, truly, our mission.
   The word mission itself means “a sending or being sent to perform a service.” That
is, people go away in order to do something. In the case of the Great Commission,
what they do is to spread the gospel to the world.
   This quarter we will look at mission first and foremost as God’s means for commu-
nicating the gospel to those who don’t know it. Mission
is a core part of God’s sovereign activity in the process
                                                            In the end, the Christian

on the love of God. And it is accomplished by the will
                                                            And it is accomplished by
of God.                                                     the will of God.
   To better understand God’s mission commitment
and involvement, this quarter’s lessons are based on the following model of salvation
history:
   1. God created men and women and gave them free will.
   2. The first man and woman abused their free will by disobeying God, and they
had to leave Paradise.
   3. God could not use force to bring them back to Paradise.
   4. God sent His Son on a mission to die in their place and reconcile them to Him.
   5. God’s mission is to make the offer of salvation known to all people and, thus,
open the way for them to have Redemption.
   At its most basic level, mission is letting the whole world know about Jesus and
about what He has done for each of us and about what He promises to do for us, now
and for eternity. In short, we who know about those promises have been called to tell
others about them, as well.

      The Missionary Nature
      of God




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 1:26–28; 2:15–17; 1 John
      2:16; John 3:14, 15; 2 Cor. 5:21; Matt. 5:13, 14.

Memory Text: “ ‘See, I have made him a witness to the peoples, a
      leader and commander of the peoples’ ” (Isaiah 55:4, NIV).



      O
               ur world is a mess, and as humans we are the big reason it is
               such a mess. And that’s because we are sinners, fallen crea-
               tures whose nature, at the core, is evil. However much we like
      to think of ourselves as advancing, as improving, the history of the
      past century isn’t too encouraging. And here we are, not even a quar-
      ter of the way into this century, and things don’t look that bright from
      here, either. If the past is a precursor to the future, all we can expect,
      to quote a former British politician, is “blood, toil, tears, and sweat.”
        All is not lost, though. On the contrary, Jesus Christ has died for
      our sins, and through His death we have the promise of salvation, of
      restoration, of all things being made new. “Now I saw a new heaven
      and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed
      away” (Rev. 21:1, NKJV).
        We have not been left alone, abandoned in the infinite expanse of a
      cold and apparently uncaring cosmos to fend for ourselves. We could
      never do it; the forces arrayed against us are so much greater than we
      are. That’s why God had the plan of salvation in order to do for us what
      we could never do for ourselves.

     God Created Man and Woman
        One of the perennial questions humans have asked is, Where do I come
     from? In the first two chapters of the Bible (in fact, all through the Bible),
     we have been given the answer to what many would consider the most
     important question a person can ask. After all, only by knowing where
     we came from are we off to a good start in knowing who we are, why we
     exist, how we are to live, and where we are ultimately going.

Skim through Genesis 1 and 2 but focus especially on Genesis 1:26–28.
     What great differences appear in the creation of humanity as
     opposed to everything else seen in the texts? What is it about
     humans that stands out from other parts of this creation?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        1. Man and woman were created last of all the creatures. They had
     the whole visible Creation in front of them to study and care for.
        2. God’s mode for creating man and woman differed from that of the
     other creatures. Up to this point, the divine command had been, “Let
     there be” (light, firmament, water, fish and birds, animals, etc.). Now
     the command was turned into consultation: “Let us make man . . .”
     The Three Persons of the Godhead—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—
     consulted about it. Though these two chapters deal with the creation of
     the earth and the creatures on it, there’s no question that the main focus
     is on the creation of humanity itself.
        3. Man and woman were created in God’s image and likeness, something
     not said about anything else that was created at that time. Though the text
     doesn’t say what it means to be made in the image and likeness of God, it
     must mean that humans in some way reflect the character of their Creator.
     Because humans have a moral capacity not seen in other creatures (butter-
     flies might be beautiful, but they don’t struggle with questions of right and
     wrong), to be made in the likeness and image of God surely means that to
     some degree humans must reflect His moral character.
        4. Man and woman were to have dominion, to represent God on earth,
     and rule over the rest of Creation. This calling entails responsibility.

      Humans are introduced in the Bible in the first chapter, but not
      in isolation. We exist, but in relationship to God. What does this
      tell us about how central God should be to our lives and why we
      are not really “complete” without Him? See also Acts 17:28.


                                                                                 7

      Free Will
         Embedded in the Creation account is the warning God gave about not
      eating from “the tree of knowledge of good and evil” (Gen. 2:9). So,
      right from the start, we can see the moral element granted humanity,
      something not seen in any of the other living creatures. As we said yes-
      terday, the capacity for moral judgment is one way that humans reveal
      the image and likeness of God.

What does Genesis 2:15–17 say about the reality of free will in humanity?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         God could have created humans so that they automatically do His
      will. That is the way the other created things, such as light, sun, moon,
      and stars, were made. They obey God without any element of choice.
      They fulfill the will of God automatically through the natural laws that
      guide their actions.
         But the creation of man and woman was special. God created them
      for Himself. God wanted them to make their own choices, to choose
      to worship Him voluntarily without being forced 10. Otherwise, they
      could not love Him, because love, to be true love, must be freely given.
         Because of its divine origin, human free will is protected and
      respected by God. The Creator does not interfere with the deepest, per-
      sistent choices of men and women. Wrong choices have consequences,
      sometimes very terrible ones, too, but it is against the character of our
      Sovereign Lord to force compliance or obedience.
         The principle of human free will has three important implications:
         For religion: an omnipotent God does not unilaterally direct indi-
      vidual will and choices.
         For ethics: individuals will be held morally accountable for their
      actions.
         For science: the actions of body and brain are not wholly determined
      by cause and effect. Physical laws are involved in our actions, but free
      will means that we do have a choice regarding our actions, especially
      moral ones.

       What are some of the free moral choices you have to make in
       the next few hours, days, or weeks? How can you be sure you are
       using this sacred gift in the right way? Think through the conse-
       quences of the wrong use of it.

The Fall
  “When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food
and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she
took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was
with her, and he ate it. Then the eyes of both of them were opened,
and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together
and made coverings for themselves” (Gen. 3:6, 7, NIV).

   Eating a little fruit was not a sinful act in itself. However, we have to
consider the circumstances in which it was carried out. Adam and Eve
were agents with a free will, made by God in His image. This included
the freedom—but also the duty—to comply with God’s expressed will.
They ate the fruit, not out of any stern necessity but rather by choice.
It was an act of Adam’s and Eve’s own free will in defiance of God’s
clear and specific instructions.
   Likewise, we must choose for ourselves whether or not to follow God
and whether to cherish or to defy the Word of God. God will not force
anyone to believe His Word. He will never force us to obey Him, and
He can’t force us to love Him. God allows each of us to choose for our-
selves which path we will follow. But, in the end, we must be prepared
to live with the consequences of our choices.
   By eating the fruit, Adam and Eve, in effect, told God that He was
not the perfect ruler. His sovereignty was challenged. They proved dis-
obedient, and as a result, they brought sin and death to the human race.
   “So the Lord God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work
the ground from which he had been taken. After he drove the man out,
he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flam-
ing sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life”
(Gen. 3:23, 24, NIV).
   Adam and Eve had to leave Paradise. It was a necessary yet merciful
consequence. The Lord would not allow rebellious humanity access to
the tree of life. With loving care, He kept Adam and Eve away from the
fruit that would make them immortal and thus perpetuate the terrible
condition into which sin had brought them. (Imagine what eternal life
would be like in a world filled with such pain and suffering and evil as
ours is!) Adam and Eve were driven out from the lovely Garden to work
the less friendly ground outside (vss. 23, 24).

 In the context of today’s study, read 1 John 2:16. How were the
 elements that were warned about in this text seen in the Fall?
 In what ways do we have to deal with these same temptations in
 our lives, as well?




                                                                          9

     God’s Initiative to Save Us
        The Bible shows that after the Fall of our first parents, it was God
     who came looking for them, not vice versa. On the contrary, the man
     and woman tried to hide themselves from the presence of the Lord.
     What a powerful metaphor for so much of the fallen human race: they
     flee the One who comes looking for them, the only One who could
     save them. Adam and Eve did it in Eden, and unless surrendered to the
     wooing of the Holy Spirit, people are still doing the same thing today.
        Fortunately, God did not cast aside our first parents, nor does He cast
     us aside either. From the time that God first called out, “ ‘Where are
     you?’ ” to Adam and Eve in Eden (Gen. 3:9, NKJV), until today, He is
     still calling us.
        “In the matchless gift of His Son, God has encircled the whole world
     with an atmosphere of grace as real as the air which circulates around
     the globe. All who choose to breathe this life-giving atmosphere will
     live and grow up to the stature of men and women in Christ Jesus.”
     —Ellen G. White, Steps to Christ, p. 68.
        Of course, the greatest revelation of God’s missionary activity can
     be seen in the incarnation and ministry of Jesus. Though Jesus came
     to this earth to do many things—to destroy Satan, to reveal the true
     character of the Father, to prove Satan’s accusations wrong, to show
     that God’s law can be kept—the crucial reason was to die on the cross
     in the place of humanity, in order to save us from the ultimate result of
     sin, which is eternal death.

What do each of these texts teach us about the death of Jesus?

       God “made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us” (2 Cor. 5:21, NKJV).
     That is what it took in order for us to be made “the righteousness of
     God in Him” (NKJV). This idea has been called the “great exchange,”
     Jesus taking on our sins and suffering as a sinner so that we, though
     sinners, can be counted as righteous before God as Jesus Himself.

     Metaphors of Mission
       Mission is God’s initiative to save lost humanity. God’s saving mis-
     sion is motivated by His love for each one of us. There is no deeper
     reason for it. God sent Christ on a mission to bring salvation for the
     whole world. John’s Gospel alone contains more than forty declarations
     of the cosmic dimension of Jesus’ mission. (See, for example, John
     3:17, 12:47.) As Christ was sent by the Father to save the world, He in
     turn sends His disciples with the words “ ‘as the Father has sent me, I
     am sending you’ ” (John 20:21, NIV).

Read Matthew 5:13, 14. What are the two metaphors used for mission
     in these texts, and what do they stand for?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        The metaphors of salt and light express core functions of Christian influ-
     ence on humanity. While salt operates internally, joining the mass with
     which it comes in contact, light operates externally, illuminating all that it
     reaches. The term “earth” in the salt metaphor refers to men and women
     with whom Christians are expected to mix, while the phrase “light of the
     world” refers to a world of people in darkness and in need of illumination.
        The children of Israel were encouraged to live up to the moral prin-
     ciples and health rules that God had given them. They were to be a
     light, illuminating and attracting—you are “a light for the Gentiles”
     (Isa. 49:6, NIV). Their collective existence in a state of health, pros-
     perity, and loyalty to God’s Sabbath and other commandments would
     proclaim to the surrounding nations God’s mighty acts of Creation and
     Redemption. The nations, observing their prosperity, would approach
     them and learn to be taught of the Lord. (That was the idea anyway.)
        When Christ came, He also talked about salt, another way to witness. By
     their influence in the world, Christians are to curb the world’s corruption.
     Unbelievers are often kept from evil deeds because of a moral conscious-
     ness traceable to Christian influence. Christians not only have a good
     influence on the corrupted world by virtue of their presence in it, they also
     mingle with people in order to share the Christian message of salvation.

      How good of a witness are you and your church to the surrounding
      world? Is the light dimming? Is the salt losing its punch? If so,
      how can you learn that revival and reformation begin with you,
      personally?


                                                                               11

Further Study: We have dealt with some aspects of the missionary
     nature of God. Mission is an enterprise of the triune God. Mission is
     predominantly related to Jesus Christ, whose Incarnation is central to
     Christian faith and mission. By His life and death, Jesus has paved the
     way for the salvation of all the human race. We, as His followers, His
     missionaries, have to let people know the good news of just what Jesus
     has done for them.

       “The church of Christ on earth was organized for missionary pur-
     poses, and the Lord desires to see the entire church devising ways and
     means whereby high and low, rich and poor, may hear the message
     of truth. Not all are called to personal labor in foreign fields, but all
     can do something by their prayers and their gifts to aid the missionary
     work.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 29.

Discussion Questions:
       Think more about the question of origins. Why do origins matter?
      How does a proper understanding of our origins help us to better
      understand who we are and what the purpose of our existence really
      is?

       How does the following quote help us to understand the exis-
      tence of free will, love, and evil in our world? “Thus, if God wants to
      create loving creatures (in imitation of his perfect love), God has to
      create free beings who can cause suffering and evil in the world by
      their choices. The dynamics of love and freedom require that God
      allow us the latitude to grow in love through our human freedom.
      God’s only alternative to allowing free beings to choose unlov-
      ing acts is to completely refrain from creating loving creatures.”
      —Robert J. Spitzer, New Proofs for the Existence of God: Contributions
      of Contemporary Physics and Philosophy, Kindle Edition (Eerdmans
      Publishing Co., 2010), p. 233.

       The death of Jesus was a single act that occurred in a small
      nation amid the vast Roman Empire almost two thousand years
      ago. Yet, this act is of eternal significance for every human being.
      What responsibility rests on us, who know about this act and what
      it means, to tell those who don’t know about it? How else will they
      learn of it if those who know about it don’t tell them?

The Gun Would Not Fire: Part 1
  by Max de los Reyes, the Philippines

   Fernando Lopez grew up in a town 60 miles south of Manila. Like many
in the Philippines, Fernando’s family didn’t have much money. And like
many young boys, Fernando quit school to help his parents by selling small
items and running errands.
   Fernando was active in his church, which helped to ease the boredom
he often felt. More than anything, Fernando longed for an education so he
could serve God better, but he knew that, humanly speaking, this wasn’t
possible.
   Then one day, Fernando heard about the 1000 Missionary Movement, a
program to train volunteer missionaries who serve God for one year in the
Philippines or in one of several countries. Excited, Fernando asked his par-
ents’ permission to join. With their blessing, he applied and was accepted.
   The training Fernando received helped to fill his desire for education and
prepared him to serve God somewhere in the Philippines. When the training
phase ended, he eagerly awaited his assignment to a territory but had mixed
emotions when he learned that he was assigned to work in an area some four
hundred miles from his home.
   Fernando arrived in his new field and began seeking out those who were
interested in learning more about God. Soon he was giving several Bible
studies a week. Some of the people taking Bible studies lived in a small set-
tlement in the mountains, a four-hour ride by bicycle from where he stayed.
   Despite the hardships, Fernando became so involved in his work that he
often spent most of his small monthly stipend to buy materials to build a
Seventh-day Adventist church, leaving him without money to buy food. This
tested his faith and prepared him for even greater tests that would come. But
throughout his experience, his faith in God did not waver.
   One of Fernando’s converts was Julie Taguinod. She and her sister, Essie,
had studied the Bible with Fernando and then attended his evangelistic
meetings. Julie and her sister had been baptized recently in spite of the
objections of Julie’s husband, Lem.
   Fernando knew of Lem’s objections to his wife’s interest in religion. Lem
had forbidden Julie to attend church and had threatened to harm her if she
continued going. But Julie had stood firm and continued to attend church.
Fernando appreciated her sincere desire to honor Christ. And Lem began
to ignore Julie’s church attendance. Perhaps he realized that his objections
would not stop his wife from following Christ.
   To be continued in next week’s Inside Story.

      Abraham: The First
      Missionary


      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 12:1–3; 14:8–24; Gal. 3:6;
      Heb. 11:8–19; Gen. 12:6, 7; 18:18, 19.

Memory Text: “So also Abraham ‘believed God, and it was credited
      to him as righteousness.’ Understand, then, that those who have
      faith are children of Abraham. Scripture foresaw that God would
      justify the Gentiles by faith, and announced the gospel in advance
      to Abraham: ‘All nations will be blessed through you’ ” (Galatians
      3:6–8, NIV).



      I
          t’s no coincidence that three of the world’s major faiths, Judaism,
          Christianity, and Islam, are sometimes called the “Abrahamic
          faiths.” That’s because all three, in one way or another, trace their
      roots back to this great man of God.
        Though Abraham is admired as the defining example of faithfulness,
      this week’s lesson will examine this faithfulness from a different angle.
      That is, we want to view him as a missionary, as someone called by the
      Lord to go to another land and witness to the people about the true God,
      the Creator and Redeemer.
        God gave Abraham, and his family after him (see Gal. 3:29), a three-
      fold purpose: (1) to be recipients and guardians of the divine truth of
      God’s kingdom that had been lost in the earlier history of humankind;
      (2) to be the channel through which the Redeemer would enter history;
      and (3) to be, as God’s faithful servants, a light to the nations, a light to
      those who needed to know the Lord.

     The Call of Abraham
       “The Lord had said to Abram, ‘Go from your country, your
     people and your father’s household to the land I will show you. I
     will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make
     your name great, and you will be a blessing. I will bless those who
     bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on
     earth will be blessed through you’ ” (Gen. 12:1–3, NIV).

        Abram—whose name meant “the father is exalted” and whose name
     was changed to Abraham, “the father of multitudes”—grew up in Ur, in
     what is now Iraq. God called him to separate himself from his familiar
     social and spiritual context and migrate to an unfamiliar country, where
     God conducted a 100-year spiritual makeover, turning him into the
     “father of the faithful.” In the midst of personal and family struggles,
     Abraham became a prototype missionary to several people groups and
     a respected leader who witnessed to his faith in God.

Read through Genesis 12:1–3. What principles can you find here that
     could apply to any of us in our own particular situation; that is,
     what did Abraham experience that we might experience in our own
     way, as well? See also Heb. 11:8–10.

       The patriarch was called to leave his past behind him, to step out in
     faith, to believe what seemed unbelievable, to do what God had called
     him to do. And as a result of his faithfulness, all the nations of the world
     would be blessed.
       Many of us are tested, as was Abraham. Of course, we might not hear
     the voice of God speaking directly to us, but He calls us by the teach-
     ings of His Word and the events of His providence. We may be required
     to abandon a career that promises wealth and honor; we might have to
     leave congenial and profitable associations and separate from family;
     indeed, we might have to enter upon what appears only to be a path of
     self-denial, hardship, and sacrifice. But if called, how can we refuse?

      In Genesis, the Hebrew reads literally, “And God said to Abram,
      ‘Go for yourself from your land.’ ” He was told to go “for him-
      self”; that is, for his own sake. How should we understand what
      that means, and how can we apply it to ourselves?


                                                                              15

     Abraham’s Testimony to the Kings
        Lot was a relative of Abraham and accompanied him on some of his
     travels. His choice of the well-watered Jordan valley brought him into
     the company of the wicked men in Sodom (Gen. 13:1–13). He was
     then rescued first by Abraham (Gen. 14:11–16) and later by two angels
     (Genesis 19).
        When Abraham heard that his relative, Lot, was in trouble, he decided
     to help him. In rescuing Lot, Abraham headed a military force of more
     than three hundred men of his own household. Numerous kings were
     involved in the battle for Sodom, and Abraham came out the victor.

Read Genesis 14:8–24. What did Abraham’s actions say about his
     character and, hence, about his faith and his God?

        To the kings he conquered, Abraham revealed the power of God.
     Even during this rescue mission, the “father of the faithful” did not lose
     his divine call to be a blessing to the nations.
        “The worshiper of Jehovah had not only rendered a great service to
     the country, but had proved himself a man of valor. It was seen that
     righteousness is not cowardice, and that Abraham’s religion made him
     courageous in maintaining the right and defending the oppressed. His
     heroic act gave him a widespread influence among the surrounding
     tribes. On his return, the king of Sodom came out with his retinue to
     honor the conqueror. He bade him take the goods, begging only that the
     prisoners should be restored. By the usage of war, the spoils belonged
     to the conquerors; but Abraham had undertaken this expedition with no
     purpose of gain, and he refused to take advantage of the unfortunate, only
     stipulating that his confederates should receive the portion to which they
     were entitled.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 135.

      Think about your dealings with others. What kind of witness do
      they present to others about your faith?

     Exemplar of Faith
       Though hardly perfect, Abraham was a man of God, and time and
     again in the Bible, even in the New Testament, he is used as an example
     of faithfulness and of what it means to be saved by faith (see Gen. 15:6,
     Gal. 3:6).

Read Hebrews 11:8–19. What does it tell us about Abraham and his
     faith that is so important for anyone who wants to be a missionary
     for God in whatever capacity possible?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       The Lord wanted to use Abraham, but the first thing He had to do
     was get him to leave his past behind. The lesson there should be obvi-
     ous to any of us, especially those of us who have pasts not in harmony
     with the will and law of God, which actually includes us all.
       Amazing, too, was the fact that though Abraham left, “he did not
     know where he was going” (Heb. 11:8, NIV). Though most mission-
     aries know where they are going, at least in a geographical sense, in
     another sense when we take a giant leap of faith and give our hearts
     totally to God, we really don’t know (at least in the short run) where we
     will wind up (though in the long run, we have absolute assurance). If
     we did know, it wouldn’t require that much faith; hence, not knowing is
     prerequisite for truly being able to live by faith.
       Another crucial point here is that Abraham was looking to “the city
     with foundations, whose architect and builder is God” (vs. 10, NIV).
     Abraham kept the big picture in mind; he knew that whatever he faced
     here, whatever toils and struggles, it would all be worth it in the end.
       He knew, too, that he wasn’t just a stranger in “the promised land” but
     that he was one of many “strangers and pilgrims on the earth” (vs. 13,
     NKJV). This world, and our lives in it, as precious as they appear to us
     now (it’s all we have now), are not the whole story, not by a long shot.
       And, of course, the greatest example of faith in the Old Testament
     was what Abraham was willing to do to his son on Mount Moriah at
     the command of God.

      In what ways have you experienced what it means to step out
      in faith? What hardships have you faced? What joys have you
      experienced? Knowing what you know now, what might you have
      done differently?


                                                                           17

     Abraham, the Wanderer
        A study of Abraham’s life reveals that his faith included difficult
     struggles against doubt and disbelief in God’s power. Abraham’s ances-
     tors were idolaters (Josh. 24:2), and perhaps this background explains
     why he did not always have full confidence in God’s power. Twice
     he showed cowardice and told Sarah to tell only a half-truth (Gen.
     12:11–13, 20:2). He laughed (Gen. 17:17) when he was told that he
     would have a son with Sarah. Despite his faults, Abraham was still used
     by the Lord because Abraham wanted to be used by Him; and thus, the
     Lord was able to mold His character.
        One means God used to shape Abraham into a reformer and
     missionary was his many wanderings. Traveling is an education
     in itself. It opens a person to new ideas and the possibilities of
     change. Pilgrimages to Jerusalem were an important and required
     part of Israelite worship. The changes the pilgrims experienced
     when they had to walk distances, sleep in other places, eat different
     food, encounter another climate, and meet other people enhanced
     their faith by their vulnerability. Their worship, with its sacrifices
     and offerings, sacred dances, and reciting of psalms, helped God’s
     people to confirm their identity and traditions.
        In his travels from his birthplace in Ur to his burial site in Hebron,
     Abraham visited at least 15 different geographical areas. Most of the
     important reforming and missionary episodes in his life are connected
     with his journeys.

What were some of the spiritual lessons that Abraham experienced in
     the following places?

     Abraham: A Missionary in His Own
     House
       “ ‘Abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation,
     and all nations on earth will be blessed through him. For I have
     chosen him, so that he will direct his children and his household
     after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing what is right and
     just, so that the Lord will bring about for Abraham what he has
     promised him’ ” (Gen. 18:18, 19, NIV). What important lessons
     about faithfulness and serving God do we find in these texts?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       “God called Abraham to be a teacher of His word, He chose him to
     be the father of a great nation, because He saw that Abraham would
     instruct his children and his household in the principles of God’s law.
     And that which gave power to Abraham’s teaching was the influence
     of his own life. His great household consisted of more than a thousand
     souls, many of them heads of families, and not a few but newly con-
     verted from heathenism.”—Ellen G. White, Education, p. 187.
       Missionary activities will be more successful when they are backed
     by a family life that is in harmony with the designs of God. Bible his-
     tory and church history tell us that most early Christian churches were
     house- and family-based. One of the reasons Abraham was chosen was
     that God saw his ability to direct his children and his household in the
     way of the Lord. God’s purpose in the family equals His purpose in
     missions; namely, “to do what is right and just” (Prov. 21:3, NIV).

What examples of Abraham’s family can you find that showed that
     they were faithful to the Lord? See, for example, Heb. 11:11, 20.

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Of course, in the Bible we can also find examples of godly men
     whose families didn’t follow the way of the Lord. Nevertheless, the
     point of the texts for today is clear: Abraham’s faith and example were
     strong enough that those of his household learned to “keep the way of
     the Lord” (Gen. 18:19).

      To “keep the way of the Lord.” What does that phrase mean to
      you? How are we to “keep the way of the Lord”?
                                                                          19

Further Study: “God called Abraham, and prospered and honored him;
     and the patriarch’s fidelity was a light to the people in all the countries
     of his sojourn. Abraham did not shut himself away from the people
     around him. He maintained friendly relations with the kings of the sur-
     rounding nations, by some of whom he was treated with great respect;
     and his integrity and unselfishness, his valor and benevolence, were
     representing the character of God. In Mesopotamia, in Canaan, in
     Egypt, and even to the inhabitants of Sodom, the God of heaven was
     revealed through His representative.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and
     Prophets, p. 368.

Discussion Questions:
       For thousands of years, the story of Abraham and Isaac on
      Mount Moriah has thrilled and challenged the faithful while
      evoking scorn and ridicule among those who have seen it as an
      act of cruelty and barbarity. Read the story over again in Genesis
      22. What great lessons can we take from it? What does it teach us
      about the Cross and the terrible cost of sin? What does it teach
      us about what taking a leap of faith entails? Why is the story so
      troubling to many?

       Read Genesis 12:11–13, 20:2, two accounts where Abraham, a
      man of God, showed a lack of faith. What can we take away from
      these stories?

       One of the most famous texts in the Bible is Genesis 15:6. What
      does it say? In what context is it given? How is this text used in the
      New Testament (see Rom. 4:3, Gal. 3:6, James 2:23)? What does it
      teach us about faith, works, and salvation?

       Who were some of the great religious leaders whose family
      members didn’t follow in “the way of the Lord”? What can we
      learn from their stories that can encourage anyone who struggles
      with helping family members to be faithful?

The Gun Would Not Fire: Part 2
  by Max de los Reyes, the Philippines

   Lem was a soldier, and his assignments often took him away from
home. When he was home, he spent much time and money drinking
with his friends.
   One day Lem’s buddies began teasing him about his wife’s interest in
religion. “What’s the matter, Lem?” one man challenged. “Couldn’t you
keep your wife from joining that church?” As the teasing grew more
intense, Lem became agitated.
   “You’re wrong!” he finally blustered. “I’ll prove to you that I can
control my wife!” With those words Lem swaggered out of the bar and
headed home.
   That afternoon Fernando had been visiting homes of people interested
in studying the Bible. He wasn’t far from Julie’s home when he decided
to stop by to make sure Julie still planned on his visit the next day. As
he neared her house, Fernando was startled by a loud blast that sounded
like a gunshot. At first, he was not concerned about it, but when another
shot rang out, he looked around to see who was shooting.
   Just then he saw Julie running toward him. “Run! Get away!” she
shouted. “Lem’s trying to kill you!”
   Fernando took cover behind a large tree. He knew that Lem was an
expert marksman, and if the man wanted to hit Fernando, he could do
so easily. Julie ran back toward the house where she found her husband
angrily yanking at his gun, trying to remove a bullet that had lodged in
the barrel. As Julie saw what he was doing, she grew bold. “Lem, you
know that God jammed your gun so you couldn’t hurt Fernando!”
   None of Lem’s efforts could unjam the gun. Surprised by this unex-
pected turn of events, Lem put the gun down and listened to Julie explain
how God had worked to save His messenger from death. When he cooled
down and sobered up, Lem admitted that his wife was right. Fernando
had done nothing to harm him.
   Lem no longer objects when his wife and children attend church ser-
vices. He has accepted Fernando’s friendship and has agreed to Bible
studies. He has told his drinking buddies that he is glad his family
attends church, and they have stopped teasing him.
   Those who witnessed the events of that day agree that God truly
worked a miracle to save Fernando’s life. But the change in Lem’s heart
is no less of a miracle.

      The Unlikely
      Missionary


      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: 2 Kings 5; Mark 1:40–45; 2 Kings
      2:1–15; John 15:5; Rom. 6:1, 4–11.

Memory Text: “And there were many in Israel with leprosy in the
      time of Elisha the prophet, yet not one of them was cleansed—only
      Naaman the Syrian” (Luke 4:27, NIV).



      T
             he books of Kings, covering the history of the kingdoms of Israel
             from about 970 to 560 b.c., record exciting and dramatic events
             and far-reaching political upheavals touching God’s people.
      Woven in these accounts are the stories of Elijah and Elisha, daring
      prophets of God whose adventures have gripped the imaginations of
      children and adults in every age.
         Also interesting are the similarities between the ministry of Elisha
      and the ministry of Jesus. In the ministries of both, dead persons were
      raised, lepers cleansed, and hungry people fed from small amounts of
      food.
        This week’s lesson deals with one of these miracles: the healing of
      Naaman, a wealthy, powerful, and very proud idolater who, in his great
      need, came to experience the power of the living God and first did so
      through the witness of a very unlikely missionary.
        Among the many spiritual truths that can be found in this account,
      we can get a model for cross-cultural witnessing in the midst of inter-
      national tension and rivalry. We can see, too, in this story a model for
      how the plan of salvation works.

     He Had It All . . . But
       “Now Naaman was commander of the army of the king of Aram.
     He was a great man in the sight of his master and highly regarded,
     because through him the Lord had given victory to Aram. He was
     a valiant soldier, but he had leprosy” (2 Kings 5:1, NIV).

       This verse contains no fewer than four descriptions or titles that put
     Naaman in the top echelon of Syrian, or Aramean, society. He exerted
     major influence on the king of Aram, was held in high esteem, and was
     the king’s right-hand man in religious, as well as military, matters (vs.
     18). He was also extremely wealthy (vs. 5).
       However, verse 1 has a major “but.” All Naaman’s power, honor, and
     bravery paled in light of the most feared disease in those days, leprosy.
     And that is exactly what this poor man had, the major “but” that cast
     a dark shadow over all else he had achieved. This ailment, however,
     brought him into contact with God’s prophet, and through that contact
     he became a believer in the true God.

Read Mark 1:40–45, Luke 8:41–56, and Mark 2:1–12. Despite the
     obvious fact that Jesus did miraculous healings here, what is the
     common denominator in these accounts? What is it that brought
     all these people to Jesus?

       Personal life disruptions, tragedies, and transitions can make people
     more open to spiritual truth and set them on a search for God. Physical,
     psychological, political, or other disasters can open people up to the
     reality of the Divine. Personal loss, national catastrophes, and wars are
     major motivators that cause people to seek a power greater than them-
     selves. The church has long been aware that increased soul-winning
     results tend to come in areas in which people are struck by personal or
     societal suffering.

      On one level Naaman appeared to have it all; on another he was
      a broken man without much hope. In what ways are we all like
      that, having good things and bad things in our lives? How can we
      learn to allow both to keep us connected to the Lord?




                                                                           23

     An Unlikely Witness
Read 2 Kings 5:1–7. What is going on here? Why would the Syrians
     even have listened to what a captive slave girl had to say? What
     might be the hidden implications of what transpired?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       The Bible gives us no real details of how this young girl acted in
     the home, but it’s clear that there was something about her that caught
     the family’s attention. Think about it: on the word of a captive female
     child in his household, a wealthy and powerful military leader goes to
     his king, tells him what she said, and then gets permission from the
     king to go. Even more so, he loads up on gifts to bring to the prophet.
     Obviously, more was going on than what is explicitly stated in the
     texts. Nevertheless, God’s agent to plant the knowledge of Him in the
     ruling circles of Syria was an unnamed little Hebrew slave girl, cruelly
     snatched from her home by a Syrian raiding party. Instead of dwell-
     ing on the cruelty and meaninglessness of that act, and of her life of
     servitude, she shared her unshaken faith in the life-changing power of
     God, who was working through Elisha in Samaria (vs. 3). Thus, like
     Daniel and his companions in Babylon, she was able to turn her own
     adversity into a way to glorify God; and thus, God turned her captivity
     into an opportunity to share her faith. According to Ellen G. White,
     “The conduct of the captive maid, the way that she bore herself in that
     heathen home, is a strong witness to the power of early home train-
     ing.”—Prophets and Kings, p. 245.

What should this tell us about how our faith, lifestyle, and actions
     can draw others to us and to the truths with which we have been
     entrusted?

        What’s fascinating, too, in this story is the reaction of the king of
     Israel upon getting the letter. Am I God? Can I heal leprosy? His words
     reveal just how dreaded the disease was and why only a miracle could
     bring about a cure. For whatever reason, the letter implied the expecta-
     tion that the king was to bring the cure. He knew that he couldn’t do
     that, and so he thought it was all a trick to instigate trouble.

     Elisha, the Prophet
        The ministry of the prophet Elisha in the ninth century b.c. comes to
     us in a series of 18 episodes, extending over more than fifty years. His
     ministry was conducted mostly as the head of the school of the proph-
     ets and was largely public. It included displays of signs and wonders
     at both the personal as well as the national level. Elisha was a prophet
     whose counsel and help were sought by both kings and commoners.

Read 2 Kings 2:1–15. What does this tell us about the calling and
     ministry of Elisha?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        No question that Elisha was called of God; he had some incredible
     experiences that must have confirmed his calling in his own mind.
     More important, his request for a “double portion” of the Spirit showed
     his awareness that for him to do what he was called to do, he would
     need divine power, because in and of himself he would be helpless.
     Thus, even back then, this man of God understood what Jesus said
     many centuries later: “ ‘I am the vine, you are the branches. He who
     abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can
     do nothing’ ” (John 15:5, NKJV). It’s a lesson that we all need to rec-
     ognize, no matter our position in the Lord’s work.
        Obviously, as we can see from the story of Elisha’s calling, this power
     had, indeed, been granted to him. Thus, Elisha revealed that he had a
     healthy and honest understanding of his own role and calling when he
     declared to the king: let Naaman “know that there is a prophet in Israel”
     (2 Kings 5:8).
        Also interesting must have been the scene when this military com-
     mander and his retinue showed up in all their glory at the door of
     Elisha’s house, probably something relatively small and modest in con-
     trast to the luxury that Naaman enjoyed. Elisha, however, didn’t seem
     all that intimidated by Naaman and his troops. In fact, Elisha did not
     so much as step outside to meet his powerful caller; instead, he sent a
     messenger, who gave the military commander a command! The only
     reward for Naaman’s long trip from Damascus was the blunt directive
     to go to the Jordan and bathe! But it was accompanied by a promise:
     “ ‘you will be cleansed’ ” (vs. 10, NIV).
        No doubt the pride of this important man was hurt. Perhaps, though,
     that was the point.
                                                                           25

     The Healing of Naaman
Read 2 Kings 5:11–14. What does this account teach us about Naaman
     and some of the lessons he had to learn? What can we take from
     this for ourselves, as well?
     _________________________________________________________

        Had the prophet Elisha personally met his prominent guest Naaman
     and employed exorcising gestures accompanied by magic formulas and
     other rituals so common in pagan religions, Naaman might not have
     hesitated. But two aspects of his reception insulted him. Not only did
     the prophet not personally come out of his house to meet Naaman, but
     he also directed him to the Jordan River as the place to get his leprosy
     cured.
        From the viewpoint of protocol, Naaman was right. Elisha should
     have left his house to greet him. And the rivers in Damascus were
     undoubtedly better, since their water was clearer than the muddy
     Jordan’s. However, through Elisha, God directed Naaman to the Jordan,
     a river in Israel. The entire cure process was designed to demonstrate,
     first, that there was a prophet of the true God in Israel and, second, that
     God rewarded believing compliance.
        Naaman’s retinue convinced him to submit to his new, divine “com-
     mander” and at least give it a try. Their argument, that if the suggested
     cure had been complicated he would have endured it, persuaded him.
     It must have been hard for Naaman to swallow his pride at having to
     listen to a slave girl, a foreign prophet who showed him little deference,
     and, finally, to his own servants. He was, though, desperate for healing.
        “So he went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times, as
     the man of God had told him, and his flesh was restored and became
     clean like that of a young boy” (2 Kings 5:14, NIV).
        The initial requirements for Naaman’s healing were belief and com-
     pliance. As soon as he conquered his pride and complied with God’s
     expressed will by bathing seven times in the muddy Jordan, he was
     cured.

      Read Romans 6:4–11. How does the story of Naaman reflect
      some of the principles taught in these verses? In what ways have
      you experienced the reality of a “new life” in Christ?

A New Believer
  “Now I know that there is no God in all the world except in Israel.
So please accept a gift from your servant” (2 Kings 5:15, NIV). In
what way do these words help to reveal the experience of salvation?
See Rev. 14:12; 1 John 5:2, 3; Rom. 6:1.

   It would have been easy for Naaman to return directly from Jordan to
Damascus after his healing. However, as a gesture of thankfulness, he
and his attendants returned to the prophet’s place. This time they met
Elisha in person. The confession that the God of Israel is sovereign in
the world is the main theme of the Bible. These words coming from a
pagan constitute one of the high points in Old Testament revelation.
Naaman’s conversion made clear that his new experience had to be
tied to the God of Israel. The prophet was an Israelite, the river was the
most important in Israel, and the number seven was a clear connection
to the God of creation.
   What we see with Naaman is an example of how true faith works:
Naaman received something that he could never have earned on his
own. The fact that Elisha refused the gifts (2 Kings 5:16) was a way
of showing how salvation cannot be earned or bought but is wholly of
God’s grace. At the same time, however, Naaman’s willingness to give
something to Elisha for what he had done for him shows the response of
faith, a response out of gratefulness for what had been given him. Elisha
refused the gift. Here he followed the example of Abraham when he
helped the pagan kings but refused rewards with the words that no one
should be able to say, “I made Abram rich” (Gen. 14:23, NIV). Elisha
knew that acceptance of a gift would have spoiled the lesson Naaman
should learn. The healing was the work of God and an act of sheer grace.
   “Let this point be fully settled in every mind: If we accept Christ
as a Redeemer, we must accept Him as a Ruler. We cannot have the
assurance and perfect confiding trust in Christ as our Saviour until we
acknowledge Him as our King and are obedient to His commandments.
Thus we evidence our allegiance to God. We have then the genuine
ring in our faith, for it is a working faith. It works by love.”—Ellen G.
White, Faith and Works, p. 16.

 If others were to look at your life, what would they see in it that
 reveals your love for God because of what He has done for you
 in Christ?




                                                                       27
                  F riday July 17

Further Study: “Centuries after Naaman returned to his Syrian home,
     healed in body and converted in spirit, his wonderful faith was referred to
     and commended by the Saviour as an object lesson for all who claim to
     serve God. ‘Many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet,’
     the Saviour declared; ‘and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman
     the Syrian.’ Luke 4:27. God passed over the many lepers in Israel because
     their unbelief closed the door of good to them. A heathen nobleman
     who had been true to his convictions of right, and who felt his need of
     help, was in the sight of God more worthy of His blessing than were the
     afflicted in Israel, who had slighted and despised their God-given privi-
     leges. God works for those who appreciate His favors and respond to the
     light given them from heaven.”—Ellen G. White, Prophets and Kings,
     pp. 252, 253.

Discussion Questions:
       Throughout the years a great deal of discussion has ensued
      over what happened after the healing of Naaman. In 2 Kings 5:17–
      19, Naaman makes a powerful confession of faith, saying, “ ‘for
      your servant will no longer offer either burnt offering or sacrifice
      to other gods, but to the Lord’ ” (vs. 17, NKJV). However, right
      after, he says, “ ‘when my master goes into the temple of Rimmon
      to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow down in the
      temple of Rimmon—when I bow down in the temple of Rimmon,
      may the Lord please pardon your servant in this thing’ ” (vs. 18,
      NKJV). What are the implications of Elisha’s reply? To what extent
      do Christian missionaries have to exercise patience and under-
      standing to new converts, especially when they come to us from a
      different religious and cultural background?

       How rapidly should enculturation of new converts take place?
      “The widow of Sarepta and Naaman the Syrian had lived up to
      all the light they had; hence they were accounted more righteous
      than God’s chosen people who had backslidden from Him and had
      sacrificed principle to convenience and worldly honor.”—Ellen G.
      White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 416.

       Healing and salvation came to Naaman by a faith revealed in
      his actions. Discuss more the whole question of the relationship
      between faith and works. Why is it so important to understand the
      crucial yet distinct roles both have in the Christian life and witness?

Twice Victorious: Part 1
  by Nathalie Villanueva, the Philippines

   The Villanueva family were devoted to one another and their church.
Napoleon, the father, often worked far from home. After a while, a pattern
of late-night socializing with his coworkers began. He began spending more
of his paycheck and sending less money home.
   Lolita, his wife, grew concerned by the dwindling checks. She knew
something was wrong and went to see her husband. When she learned of
his activities, she tried to reason with him but eventually returned home,
frustrated and hurt.
   Lolita found a Bible and began searching for guidance and comfort.
One day as she read the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20, the fourth
commandment stopped her. “Remember the Sabbath day,” it said. She
had always worshiped on Sunday. But if Christ died on Friday, rested on
the Sabbath, and rose from the dead on the first day, Sunday, then the
Sabbath day must be Saturday. She decided that if God had commanded
His children to keep the Sabbath day holy, she would obey.
   But she found it more difficult to obey the first and second command-
ments. All of her life she had prayed while looking at statues of Christ or
a saint. “Lord,” she prayed, “I’m sorry, but I can’t pray without looking at
You or a saint! Please give me a sign that I mustn’t pray to these statues!”
   During the night, Lolita was awakened by the sound of breaking glass,
followed by beating wings. She thought that the neighbor’s rooster had
gotten into her house. But before she could investigate, she fell back to
sleep. When she got up the next morning, she found that her statues of
saints had fallen and were lying on the floor, broken into hundreds of
tiny pieces. She fell to her knees and asked God to forgive her for doubt-
ing His Word.
   Lolita found a Seventh-day Adventist church and decided to attend.
She arrived long before services began and knelt quietly to pray. During
the worship service, she wept. Afterward, a woman invited her to study
the Bible. Lolita eagerly accepted and was soon ready for baptism.
   Lolita invited her five teenage children to attend church, but they were
busy. However, when they were free, they went with her. They found
the church service to be long but enjoyed the afternoon youth meetings.
   Napoleon returned home and learned that Lolita planned to be bap-
tized. Out of respect, the family members attended church with her when
they could. One by one, Lolita’s husband and children were baptized.
   To be continued in next week’s Inside Story.

      The Jonah                    Saga



      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Jonah 1–4, 2 Kings 14:25, Isa.
      56:7, Isa. 44:8, Matt. 12:40, Rev. 14:6–12.

Memory Text: “ ‘I now realize how true it is that God does not show
      favoritism but accepts from every nation the one who fears him and
      does what is right’ ” (Acts 10:34, 35, NIV).



      T
              he Jonah saga is the account of a Hebrew prophet working well
              beyond his comfort zone. Alive during the reign of Jeroboam II,
              about 750 b.c. (2 Kings 14:25), Jonah is the only Old Testament
      prophet whom we know of who was directly called to be a mission-
      ary in another country. The truth that the Creator of all races did not
      intend to limit salvation to only His chosen people is stated repeatedly
      in the Old Testament, especially in Isaiah and the Psalms, even though
      popular Israelite theology at the time of Jonah did not accept that the
      Gentiles were also in God’s plan to partake in salvation. Even in New
      Testament times, it was a hard lesson for the Jewish believers to learn.
         In the four chapters of Jonah, we read an honest record of Jonah’s
      reluctant pioneering experience as a foreign missionary, both the posi-
      tive and the negative. Here a person’s inner, and very human, reaction
      to the call of God is preserved, along with a powerful appeal for the
      need of foreign missionaries. A few guidelines for foreign missionaries
      and cross-cultural witnesses emerge from the book, which also points
      to solutions for some of the issues and problems modern missionaries
      face.

     The Flawed Prophet
Read 2 Kings 14:25. What does this tell us about Jonah? In what kind
     of light is he presented?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Outside the book of Jonah, the prophet is mentioned in one other Old
     Testament passage, 2 Kings 14:25. Here he is honored as a prophet that
     predicted Israel’s recapture of territory taken by Syria.
       Jonah was born in Gath Hepher (Hebrew for “winepress at the water
     hole”), a town in Zebulun in northern Israel, only a few miles from
     Nazareth. This means that both Jesus and Jonah were Galilean proph-
     ets, separated by about 750 years.

Read Jonah 1:1–3, 9, 12; 2:1–9; 3:3–10. What kind of picture do these
     verses present about him, both the good and the bad?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Jonah emerges from his book a strange mixture of strength and weak-
     ness: self-willed and rebellious but also teachable and obedient. He was
     loyal to God, courageous, and a believer in prayer, but he was also narrow-
     minded, selfish, and vindictive. While Jonah was described as a servant of
     the Lord in 2 Kings 14:25, he cut a somewhat sad and tragic figure in the
     book bearing his name. It is a mark of the integrity and reliability of the
     Bible that he was described in such a candid manner. The natural, human
     tendency of a writer would be to obscure and hide less-acceptable aspects
     of biblical heroes. But under the Spirit’s inspiration, the Bible’s authors
     present the valiant along with the petty in the lives of people to illustrate
     the truth that, no matter how weak and unpleasant these characters may be,
     God is able to work through them if they are willing.

      What other Bible characters did God use despite their personal-
      ity flaws? What hope can we draw for ourselves from the fact
      that God uses flawed and damaged people to work for Him in
      reaching out to others?


                                                                               31

     An Early Missionary
       “Go to Nineveh!” was God’s command to Jonah. In the Old Testament,
     the usual appeal to the nations was “come to Zion.” God’s original plan
     was for Israel to live their religion, making the nation so attractive that
     other nations would come to them for guidance (Isa. 56:7).
       Jonah, as a forerunner of the disciples in the New Testament (Matt.
     28:18–20), is told to go to Nineveh, which to him seemed an unclean
     center of idolatry, brutality, and totalitarianism. Jonah made detailed
     preparations to go west by sea, even though God had directed him
     to go east by land. Jonah, the unwilling prophet, fled in the opposite
     direction.

Read Jonah 1:3–17. What lessons can we gain from this amazing nar-
     rative?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        God’s response to Jonah’s flight came in the form of a mighty storm.
     The winds obey their Creator, even though His prophet does not (Mark
     4:41). Jonah slept during the storm while the Gentile crew prayed (Jon.
     1:5). In honesty, Jonah confessed that he caused the calamity, and
     he testified to the true God and Creator. Notice that his reply, “I am
     Hebrew,” referred both to his religion and his nationality. In their alarm
     at the ferocity of the storm, the Gentile sailors tried to save themselves
     and the passengers, and they showed compassion to Jonah in their
     reluctance to comply with his instructions to throw him overboard.
     (The reluctant prophet was willing to sacrifice himself to save others.)
     When they finally complied, the storm ceased and the sea calmed (vs.
     15). The amazed sailors became Jonah’s first converts to his God, who
     could work through Jonah, even while he fled from his call.
        The salvation of Jonah was just as miraculous as was the salvation
     of the ship. God prepared “a great fish.” The original Hebrew doesn’t
     specify what sort of fish saved Jonah by swallowing him. Jonah in
     the belly of the fish is certainly the best-known episode of the story;
     however, it should not overshadow the book’s deeper message that God
     loves, cares for, and wills the salvation of all people.

      In the end, there is only one God, the Creator of the heavens and
      the earth (see Isa. 44:8; 45:5, 6). Anything else anyone worships
      is idolatry and error. Any other “god” they pray to is imaginary, a
      lie. Why is this truth so important for us to realize and internalize
      for ourselves, especially in the context of mission?

     In the Belly of the Big Fish
        The three-day experience in the belly of the big fish became a type
     of the death and resurrection of Christ (Jon. 1:17–2:10, Matt. 12:40).
     God provided and directed the great fish. Although there are accounts
     of people who survived at sea after having been swallowed by a whale,
     we must remember that God provided this particular great fish, as well
     as the miraculous power that sustained His servant while inside. In the
     end, this was a miraculous event that could have occurred only through
     the supernatural intervention of the Lord, who is revealed all through
     the Bible as a personal God who does indeed intervene miraculously
     in people’s lives.
        There is evidence that the phrase “three days and three nights” was
     an ancient figure of speech expressing the time needed for the imagi-
     nary journey to Sheol, the Hebrew name for the realm of the dead.
     Considering what happened to him, Jonah indeed should have been as
     good as dead.
        In the belly of the fish, Jonah began to pray. The captain had directed
     Jonah in vain to “call on your God” (Jon. 1:6, NKJV). Now in a hope-
     less situation, Jonah starts to pray, and seriously too. It took something
     this desperate to get him finally to do what he should have been doing
     all along. A summary of Jonah’s prayer has been preserved in the form
     of a psalm of thanksgiving. Such psalms typically include five parts:
     (1) introduction; (2) description of the distress; (3) cry to God for help;
     (4) report of God’s action; and (5) promise to keep any vow made and
     to testify to God’s saving action. That is, Lord, if You get me out of this,
     I promise to do such and such. Who hasn’t prayed like that before? The
     question is, Did you do what you covenanted to do?

Read Matthew 12:40. How does Jesus take the story of Jonah and
     apply it to Himself? See also John 2:19–22.

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        The chapter ends with the words: “And the Lord commanded the
     fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land” (Jon. 2:10, NIV). God’s com-
     mand to the great fish brought about what well-meaning sailors failed
     to do for Jonah. In the same way, Christ commanded the disciples after
     His resurrection to go into all the world; so, Jonah after his underwater
     adventure went to the Gentiles and became the most successful mis-
     sionary in the Old Testament. Jonah’s rescue witnessed to God’s sav-
     ing mercy. His seaweed-draped arrival on the beach testified to God’s
     determination to save even sinful Assyrians from death.
                                                                              33

     The Nineveh Generation
Read Jonah 3. What great message is found here in the context of
     outreach and evangelism?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        “Then the word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time: ‘Go to
     the great city of Nineveh and proclaim to it the message I give you’ ”
     (Jon. 3:1, 2, NIV). Two verbs are important in the text. First, this is the
     second time God says “Go!” God does not give up. He grants failing
     humans a second chance. Here again we have the New Testament mis-
     sion concept, which is the idea of going to the nations, as opposed to
     expecting the nations to come to you.
        The other important verb is “proclaim.” Proclamation has always been
     important in the Bible. It is still the most effective way of spreading the
     gospel message. God emphasized to Jonah that it should be “the mes-
     sage I give you.” That is, the message we proclaim must be God’s, not
     our own, nor even a tweaked, modified, or bowdlerized version of it.
        God’s message is generally threat and promise, judgment and gospel.
     His stark proclamation was, “Forty more days and Nineveh will be
     overthrown” (vs. 4, NIV). That was the judgment. Yet, there was also
     the promise of hope, of deliverance, of salvation (there must have been
     because the people heeded the message and were saved).
        Even with the “everlasting gospel” at the heart of it, Revelation
     14:6–12 also warns about judgment. Gospel and judgment go hand-in-
     hand: the gospel offers us God’s way to avoid the condemnation that
     judgment would justly bring upon us all.
        No preaching of the gospel is fully effective unless judgment is
     taught. “Political correctness,” which leads to a watering down of these
     stark elements and downplaying differences between religions or even
     between different Christian traditions, is risky. Though in mission we
     need to adapt our presentation for the people we are trying to reach
     (contextualization), we must never do so at the expense of the message
     God has given us to proclaim.
        In Jonah 3:5–10, what happens? The Ninevites believed, acted on
     their beliefs, exercised their faith, and were saved.

      God has given us some wonderful promises, and stern warnings,
      too. What should this story teach us about the conditionality of
      these promises and warnings?

     Jonah’s Lament
        Jonah 4:1–11 confirms that the greatest obstacle for God to get His
     prophet involved in world mission was not distance, wind, sailors, fish,
     or Ninevites. It was the prophet himself. Ninevite faith contrasted with
     Jonah’s unbelief and vindictive spirit. Jonah is the only person in the
     Scriptures who accuses God of being gracious, compassionate, and
     slow to anger, abounding in love and who relents from sending calam-
     ity. One would think most people would view these aspects of God with
     thankfulness.
        “When Jonah learned of God’s purpose to spare the city that, not-
     withstanding its wickedness, had been led to repent in sackcloth and
     ashes, he should have been the first to rejoice because of God’s amaz-
     ing grace; but instead he allowed his mind to dwell upon the possibility
     of his being regarded as a false prophet. Jealous of his reputation, he
     lost sight of the infinitely greater value of the souls in that wretched
     city. The compassion shown by God toward the repentant Ninevites
     ‘displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.’ ”—Ellen G.
     White, Prophets and Kings, p. 271.

Read Jonah 4:10, 11. What do these texts teach us about the character
      of God in contrast to sinful human nature? Why should we be glad
      that God, not fellow human beings, is our ultimate Judge?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Jonah showed his anger twice in chapter 4. He was angry because
     God changed His mind and saved Nineveh’s more than one hundred
     twenty thousand inhabitants. He was also angry because the vine
     withered. In his selfishness, the prophet needed to get his priorities
     right.
       God instructed Jonah to recognize human brotherhood based on the
     fatherhood of God. The prophet should accept his common humanity
     with these “foreigners,” although they were wayward. Were not 120,000

       Read again the Lord’s rebuke to Jonah. In what ways might the
       Lord be able to say something similar to us? That is, how often do
       we find ourselves more concerned about our own personal issues,
       many of which at times can really be trivial, than about the lost
       souls whom Christ shed His blood to save?

Further Study: “The book of Jonah is so significant for understanding
      the biblical basis of mission, because it treats God’s mandate to His
      people regarding the Gentile peoples, and thus serves as the prepara-
      tory step to the missionary mandate of the New Testament. But it is
      also important for catching a glimpse of the deep resistance this man-
      date encounters from the very servant Yahweh has chosen to discharge
      His worldwide work.”—Johannes Verkuyl, Contemporary Missiology
      (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Wm. B. Eerdmans Pub. Co., 1978), p. 96.

Discussion Questions:
        “In the history of Nineveh there is a lesson which you should
       study carefully. . . . You must know your duty to your fellow beings
       who are ignorant and defiled and who need your help.”—Ellen G.
       White, The Southern Work, p. 80. What is our duty to these fellow
       beings?

        Assyria was one of the superpowers dominating the ancient
       near east from about 885 to 625 b.c. Israel and Judah suffered
       repeatedly under her harsh rule. Israel’s King Jehu was forced
       to pay tribute to the dominating Assyrian ruler, Shalmaneser I11.
       Israel finally fell to Assyrian forces about 722 b.c. No wonder
       Jonah was reluctant to go to Nineveh, one of the four chief cities
       of Assyria, and the center for the worship of Ishtar, goddess of love
       and war. God had called him to visit the very spiritual heartland
       of enemy territory to call on the warlike Assyrians to repent. What
       lessons are here for us in regard to missions?

        How can the remnant church avoid the assumption that the
       counsels and blessings of the Lord in areas such as the Sabbath,
       health, and education are given to them for their own benefit,
       rather than for the benefit of the nations? Read Rev. 3:17, 18.

        In what ways do the three angels’ messages of Revelation
       14:6–12 reflect the message that Jonah had for the Ninevites?

        Some people automatically reject the Jonah story, particularly
       the part where he is in the belly of the fish. What presuppositions
       would cause them to reject it out of hand? What presuppositions
       do you need in order to believe it?

Twice Victorious: Part 2
  by Nathalie Villanueva, the Philippines

   The Villanueva teens joined the Pathfinder Club. The club scheduled
an outing to Mount Kitanglad, hoping to earn their mountain-climbing
honor.
   James Villanueva, age 16, eagerly started the six-hour trek up the
mountain with his sisters and 12 other Pathfinders. Soon he found him-
self ahead of the rest and decided to wait. He stepped onto a tree stump
to get a better view. Three wires, similar to those strung along the trail
to guide hikers, hung above his head. He reached up and grabbed one of
the wires for balance. When he saw his sisters approaching, he turned
to swing off the stump. As his feet left the stump, a sharp pain flashed
through his hand, and he crumpled to the ground.
   James’s sister Nathalie saw him jump. She saw sparks shoot out from
his hands as he fell. She raced to where he lay motionless. His hands and
arms were so badly burned that the skin was peeling off.
   “Someone get help!” she shouted. “James has been electrocuted!”
   While someone ran for help, Nathalie tore off her shirt to make ban-
dages for her brother’s arms. Toto, the Pathfinder leader, raced up the
slippery mountainside. He ordered some Pathfinders to climb to the
summit and call for help. He sent the rest down the mountain to summon
an ambulance. Toto and Nathalie remained with James, praying that help
would come in time.
   Three men who worked at the summit came upon the accident scene.
The men rigged a stretcher from a sleeping bag and began the dangerous
trip down the slippery mountain.
   It was dark when they reached the bottom. They placed James in an
oxcart to carry him the two and a half miles to where an ambulance
waited. James arrived at the hospital 12 hours after the accident.
   Nathalie stayed with her brother until their parents arrived. The doc-
tors wanted permission to amputate both of James’s arms, but Nathalie
refused. When her parents arrived, she begged them to have James
airlifted to Manila, where he could receive better care. But even there
the doctors said that James’s left arm was too badly burned to be saved.
   Through the difficult months following the accident, the family could
have lost their faith. But prayers and the support of the church members
helped to hold their faith intact.
   James is already planning to go back and conquer Mount Kitanglad
to earn his mountain-climbing honor. But in the eyes of many, he has
already conquered more than a mountain.
  Nathalie Villanueva is the daughter of Napoleon and Lolita Villanueva
and the sister of James.

      Exiles as                Missionaries



      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Daniel 1–12; Isa. 39:5–7;
      Dan. 2:44; Matt. 24:14, 15; Genesis 41.

Memory Text: “ ‘He was given authority, glory and sovereign power;
      all nations and peoples of every language worshiped him. His domin-
      ion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his king-
      dom is one that will never be destroyed’ ” (Daniel 7:14, NIV).



      A
               s a people of prophecy, Seventh-day Adventists believe in the
               soon coming of Jesus Christ. His coming will end this world
               as we know it and ultimately will usher in God’s everlasting
      kingdom, depicted in the book of Daniel this way: “ ‘ “The kingdom and
      dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven,
      shall be given to the people, the saints of the Most High. His kingdom is
      an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey Him” ’ ”
      (Dan. 7:27, NKJV). This kingdom is the culmination of our faith; it is
      what the book of Hebrews (Heb. 11:16) called the “better country,” the
      one that all God’s people through the ages have trusted will come, the
      one whose “builder and maker is God” (vs. 10).
        But the book of Daniel is also a kind of handbook for missionary
      activity. From it we can draw lessons on how the Lord was able to use
      some of His people to witness to those who were steeped in spiritual
      and theological ignorance. Through their faithfulness and diligence and
      unwavering faith, these believers revealed the reality of the living God
      to those who knew only false ones and gave these pagans a chance at a
      place in this everlasting kingdom, as well.

      The Exile
Read Isaiah 39:5–7 and Daniel 1:1, 2. How are these verses related?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         Daniel, whose name means “God is my Judge,” was force-marched
      from a defeated Jerusalem into the Babylonian capital. The book of
      Daniel gives glimpses of his life in the courts of Babylon and Persia.
      After three years of “education” in Babylon, Daniel was employed as
      a civil servant and royal advisor. Through the power of God, he rose
      above normal captive status to become a highly placed missionary to
      two superpowers.
         The book of Daniel is more than a treasure of prophetic literature.
      The reader encounters some of the challenges facing Hebrews living
      in an alien culture that provided no apparent support for their loyalty
      to the God of Israel and, at times, was openly hostile. It also paints a
      beautiful picture of men who learned to live out their commitment to
      truth in the absence of the temple, the priesthood, and sacrifices.

Read Daniel 1:8–13, 5:12, 6:4, 9:3–19. What do these texts tell us about
      Daniel’s character that made him the great missionary he was?

         “Every institution that bears the name of Seventh-day Adventist is to
      be to the world as was Joseph in Egypt, and as were Daniel and his fel-
      lows in Babylon. In the providence of God these men were taken cap-
      tive, that they might carry to heathen nations the knowledge of the true
      God. They were to be representatives of God in our world. They were
      to make no compromise with the idolatrous nations with which they
      were brought in contact, but were to stand loyal to their faith, bearing
      as a special honor the name of worshipers of the God who created the
      heavens and the earth.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church,
      vol. 8, p. 153.

       Think how easy it would have been for Daniel to have compromised,
       especially given his circumstances. What does his example teach us
       about how lame our excuses for compromise often really are?
                                                                           39

      Witnesses           (Daniel 2–5)

        In Daniel 2, Daniel had an opportunity, born out of necessity, to
      witness to the power of the true God, as opposed to the false ones of
      Babylon. After singing a hymn of praise with his Jewish compatriots
      and thanking God for answering their prayers (Dan. 2:20–23), he inter-
      preted the king’s dream and testified to God’s greatness and dominion
      over all earthly kingdoms.

What does the king say that shows he learned something about the true
      God? See Dan. 2:47.

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        In Daniel 2, Daniel didn’t have a choice: either give the king what he
      wanted or face death. In contrast, in chapter 3, his three friends could
      have spared themselves the fiery furnace if they simply had obeyed the
      king’s command. Instead, by their faithful witness, they were able to
      testify to the power of the true God.
        “How did Nebuchadnezzar know that the form of the fourth was like
      the Son of God? He had heard of the Son of God from the Hebrew
      captives that were in his kingdom. They had brought the knowledge of
      the living God who ruleth all things.”—Ellen G. White, Advent Review
      and Sabbath Herald, May 3, 1892.

In Daniel 4, what confession did King Nebuchadnezzar again make regard-
      ing the true God, all thanks to the witness of Daniel? See Dan. 4:37.

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         In Daniel 5, we have Daniel’s last appearance at the Babylonian
      court, where he is called upon to explain the extraordinary writing
      upon the wall of Belshazzar’s palace, foretelling the overthrow of the
      Babylonian Empire at the hands of the Medes and Persians. Though no
      doubt Belshazzar had been impressed by what Daniel did, it was too
      late: the king’s fate was all but sealed. The sad thing is that according to
      the Bible (see Dan. 5:17–23), Belshazzar had had opportunity to learn
      truth and to be humbled by it. As we know, he didn’t take advantage of
      those opportunities.

       How important that we look at our own lives and ask ourselves,
       What kind of witness does my life represent to the world? What
       does your answer tell you?

Daniel in Persia
  “And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice
unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel, ser-
vant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually,
able to deliver thee from the lions?” (Dan. 6:20). The king called
Daniel the “servant of the living God.” What is implied in those
words?

   In Daniel 6, with the change of empire and king, Daniel still kept
his position and was even promoted, becoming one of three presidents
to whom 120 satraps were to report. King Darius even considered
appointing him vizier over his whole kingdom, arousing the antipathy
of the other presidents and satraps. They induced the king to make
an empire-wide decree that really was aimed at Daniel alone. He was
thrown into a den of lions, but God dramatically intervened in a situa-
tion that even the sympathetic king could not reverse. Daniel’s deliver-
ance so pleased the king that he issued an empire-wide royal decree
exalting the God of Daniel.
   “Then King Darius wrote to all the nations and peoples of every lan-
guage in all the earth: ‘May you prosper greatly! I issue a decree that
in every part of my kingdom people must fear and reverence the God
of Daniel. For he is the living God and he endures forever; his kingdom
will not be destroyed, his dominion will never end. He rescues and he
saves; he performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth.
He has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions’ ” (Dan. 6:25–27,
NIV).

 Read Daniel 6. What in the chapter indicates that Daniel had
 already been a great witness to the king? Also, what in the king’s
 decree indicates that he knew more about Daniel’s God than he
 could have learned merely from the dramatic rescue? What does
 this tell us about Daniel’s witness to him?

      Daniel and God’s Eternal Kingdom
        Daniel was not merely an interpreter of other men’s dreams, signifi-
      cant as that was in this context. In Daniel 7–12, he had his own visions,
      which revealed the future of great world superpowers. Daniel’s visions
      especially emphasized that, despite earthly rulers and their plans and
      machinations, God retains final control of nations. In the end, He and
      His final kingdom will triumph, and that triumph will be complete (see
      Dan. 2:44).

Read Daniel 7:13, 14. What is being described in these texts, and how
      does it relate to the idea of Christians taking the gospel to the
      world?

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        Whatever else those verses are talking about, the central issue is the
      establishment of God’s eternal kingdom, which doesn’t come until after
      the return of Jesus. And what factor did Jesus Himself say was impor-
      tant in regard to His return?
        “ ‘And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole
      world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. So
      when you see standing in the holy place ‘the abomination that causes
      desolation,’ spoken of through the prophet Daniel—let the reader
      understand—then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains’ ”
      (Matt. 24:14–16, NIV).
        Jesus’ prophecies of the end of the world in Matthew 24 are linked
      to Daniel’s prophecies. The “abomination of desolation” predicted by
      Daniel (Dan. 11:31, 12:11) was further explained and applied by Jesus
      to His own day and beyond. The point is that Jesus closely linked the
      book of Daniel to the end times, which, of course, isn’t surprising,
      because Daniel in many places does indeed point to the end times (Dan.
      8:17, 19; 11:35; 12:4, 13). And, according to Jesus, the end doesn’t
      come until “this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the
      world” (Matt. 24:14, NKJV).

       The gospel is to be preached unto “all the world,” and only then
       will Jesus return. And we are the ones called to preach it. Some
       then argue that Jesus can’t return until we do our work. How are
       we to understand our role in the timing of Jesus’ return? Bring
       your answer to class on Sabbath.

     More Exiles as Missionaries
        Daniel was an Israelite in involuntary banishment from Israel, as
     were Joseph and Moses in Egypt, Nehemiah in Babylon, and Esther in
     Persia. Their lives reveal that it is possible to live faithfully to God in
     spiritually and culturally unsupportive environments. With God’s direc-
     tion, it was even possible to attain prominent administrative positions
     in these alien settings. Each lived a creative and rich life, skillfully
     negotiating complex religious, social, political, and economic dynam-
     ics far different from those of their home culture. They not only were
     loyal members of exiled Hebrew communities—they were also in their
     own ways effective missionaries for the God of Israel.
        Witness while in exile included both passive presence and active
     proclamation.

Further Study: “Multitudes will be called to a wider ministry. The whole
      world is opening to the gospel. . . . From every quarter of this world of
      ours comes the cry of sin-stricken hearts for a knowledge of the God
      of love. . . . It rests with us who have received the knowledge, with
      our children to whom we may impart it, to answer their cry. To every
      household and every school, to every parent, teacher, and child upon
      whom has shone the light of the gospel, comes at this crisis the ques-
      tion put to Esther the queen at that momentous crisis in Israel’s history,
      ‘Who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as
      this?’ ”—Ellen G. White, The Adventist Home, pp. 484, 485.

Discussion Questions:
        Discuss the prophecies in the book of Daniel, especially Daniel
       2, 7, and 8. In what ways are these such a powerful testimony, not
       only to the prophetic reliability of the Bible but to God’s fore-
       knowledge? For instance, notice how, between Daniel 2, 7, and 8,
       three of the four main kingdoms are named for us. How should
       this help us learn to trust in the Word of God and His promises to
       us?

        In these accounts in the book of Daniel and some of the other
       stories (such as that of Joseph), there were some miracles that,
       of course, greatly added to the credibility of their witness to the
       pagans around them. At the same time, too, what aspects of their
       character lend even more credibility to their witness? That is, in
       what way can character and faithfulness, even more than signs
       and wonders, be a more powerful witness to others about the real-
       ity of God and what He can do in our lives?

        As we saw in Wednesday’s study, Matthew 24:14 says that the
       gospel needs to go to the ends of the earth, and then the end will
       come. Does this mean that Jesus will not come back until we do
       the work that He has called us to do? Discuss.

A Gift From the River: Part 1
by Doneshor Tripura, Bangladesh
   Doneshor was glad to be home, watching his father’s water buffalo. He
had been away at school and had just completed his high school gradua-
tion exams. The day grew hotter, and Doneshor decided to go for a swim
in the nearby river while the buffalo grazed nearby. He waded into the
cool water, looking for a place that was deep enough to swim. It was the
dry season, and the river was much shallower than usual.
   Doneshor stood in the waist-deep water and looked upstream. He saw
something floating in the water. It wasn’t unusual to find debris in the
river, so he wasn’t sure why this object caught his eye. He waited as it
bobbed closer to him, then he reached down and picked it out of the
water. It was a Bible. He had never seen a Bible before, but instinctively
he knew that this was a holy Book. He waded ashore and carefully laid
the wet book in the sun to dry. As a few pages dried, he then turned to
other wet pages and allowed the sun’s hot rays to dry them.
   Doneshor came from a religious family. Every day they worshiped
their gods, laying gifts of rice and incense on the altar in their home.
Doneshor’s parents had taught him to respect all things holy, and that
included the Book he had found in the river.
   The Book wasn’t yet dry when evening came, so Doneshor took it
home. The next morning he carried it back to the field and laid it open
in the sun. After three days, the Bible was dry enough for him to read it.
Curious, he turned to the first pages and began reading, “In the begin-
ning God created . . .”
   Doneshor was fascinated by the account of Creation and the first
man and woman. He remembered reading about the first humans in the
Bhagavad Gita, the Hindu holy book. An idea struck him, and he began
comparing the Bhagavad Gita with the Bible.
   One day he read the prayer that Jesus taught His disciples and con-
trasted that to his own prayers. I have done nothing but ask and ask,
wanting something for myself or my family. Now I understand that
Christians pray for others.
   As Doneshor continued reading, he discovered a God who searches
out and invites people to accept His gift of salvation. This God is patient,
and He loves to forgive. Doneshor thought how his entire life had been
an effort to earn the favor of the gods by giving them expensive gifts and
by making long and tiring pilgrimages to appease them.
   To be continued in next week’s Inside Story.

             within the dangerous political heart of the Persian Empire.
             Her mission involved her in a series of striking contrasts. An
      orphaned female member of a despised ethnic and religious minority
      living in the superpower of her day, she became the wife of the Persian
      king. This was no rags-to-riches fairy tale. Rather, she was lifted from
      obscurity and groomed to carry out a highly specialized mission. It
      required of her the risky strategy of working, at first, undercover. Later
      she had to make a perilous full disclosure of her ethnicity and faith.
         Supported by her cousin and foster father, Mordecai, her daring
      witness at the intrigue-ridden court of the Persian Empire saved her
      people, reversed their low social status, and made them empire-wide
      objects of admiration.
         No doubt as a result of her faithfulness, knowledge of the true God
      became more widespread among their heathen captors. Though not
      your “typical” missionary story, the narrative of Esther and Mordecai
      does present some interesting principles that can help us to understand
      what it means to witness in peculiar circumstances.

     Esther in Persia
Read Esther 1:2–20. What is happening here? What things about this
     story are hard to understand from our perspective today? (As you
     read, remember that a lot of details are not presented.)

       The weeklong banquet that King Ahasuerus gave for his nobles and
     officials seems extravagant, even for someone at the pinnacle of politi-
     cal power, far beyond what most Christians would find acceptable.
     The unrestricted consumption of alcohol (Esther 1:7, 8) was unusual,
     because drinking during ancient formal feasts was usually controlled
     by convention and ritual. In this case, it clouded the king’s judgment to
     the point that he ordered his wife Vashti to provide entertainment for
     the king’s drunken, all-male gathering. This was far beneath her dignity
     as a married woman and as a member of the royal family. Whatever
     her response, she faced the dilemma of losing status, and her coura-
     geous choice to retain self-esteem in the face of an autocratic ruler’s
     base desires prepares the reader to understand the power for good that
     a principled woman could exert, even in a male-dominated royal court.
       Meanwhile, though, we have to deal with the actions of Esther.
     Esther 2:3 gives the impression that these women were not volunteers.
     The king issued the decree, and so Esther had to come. Had she refused,
     who knows the outcome?


Read 1 Corinthians 9:19–23. In what ways can we apply the principles
     seen in these verses to what happened with Esther? Or do they apply?

     _________________________________________________________

      So far in the story the real heroine is Vashti, who then disappears
      from history. Her modesty and stand on principle opened the way
      for Esther. In some cases, though, principled stands don’t always
      lead to an obvious good. In the end, why should we take prin-
      cipled stands, even if we don’t know the outcome of our actions?


                                                                           47

      Esther in the Court of the King
Read Esther 2:10, 20. What situations might arise where nationality or
      religious affiliation should be hidden, at least for a time?
      _________________________________________________________

Read John 4:1–26, the story of Jesus and the woman at the well. Why
      did Jesus tell her so openly that He was the Messiah, when among
      His own people He was not so forthcoming? How does this account,
      perhaps, help us to understand Mordecai’s words to Esther?

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         Twice Mordecai charged Esther not to reveal her nationality and
      family background. This has troubled some commentators, who have
      questioned the need for this attitude of concealment, especially during
      a time that the Jewish people were not threatened. Could she not have
      been a witness about her God to these pagans if she were open about
      who she was and the God she worshiped? Or could it be argued that
      to be a Jew lacked credibility at the Persian court and that revealing
      her ethnicity would have hindered her in gaining access to the king
      when she pleaded for her people? It appears that even before the threat
      occurred, Mordecai had warned Esther not to reveal her identity. The
      fact is that the Bible does not tell us the reason for his words to her;
      however, as we can see with the example of Jesus, one does not have to
      reveal everything at once in every circumstance. Prudence is a virtue.
         Meanwhile, why did Jesus speak so openly to the woman at the well
      and not to His own people?
         “Christ was far more reserved when He spoke to them. That which
      had been withheld from the Jews, and which the disciples were after-
      ward enjoined to keep secret, was revealed to her. Jesus saw that she
      would make use of her knowledge in bringing others to share His
      grace.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 190.

       Have you ever been in a situation in which you deemed it prudent
       not to say too much about your faith or your beliefs? What rea-
       sons did you have? As you look back now, what might you have
       done differently, if anything?

     “For Such a Time as This”
       In Esther 3:1–5, the plot of the story starts to unfold. Mordecai, a
     Jew—following the commandment against idolatry—refused to bow
     down to Haman, a mere man. Furious, Haman sought a way to avenge
     himself for what he took as a slight. Mordecai, by his actions, in a way
     was witnessing among these pagans about the true God.

What excuse did Haman use to try to rid the empire of the Jews? What
     does this tell us about how easy it is to let cultural differences blind
     us to the humanity of all people? Esther 3:8–13; see also Acts 17:26.

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       As Haman’s plot was made known, Mordecai expressed his grief
     visibly, using one of the Jewish religious rituals mentioned in the book
     of Esther: “He tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, . . . wail-
     ing loudly and bitterly” (Esther 4:1, NIV). In the meantime, Esther
     prepared to go before the king. She would become a Jewish breaker
     of royal Persian law by heroically entering the king’s presence without
     invitation, as part of a plan to foil Haman’s plot. The king admitted
     her and accepted her invitation to dine. Esther now takes the lead in
     the drama faced by the Jewish exiles across all of Persia. In this story,
     Esther showed self-denial and heroism (vs. 16), tact (Esther 5:8), and
     courage (Esther 7:6).
       “Through Esther the queen[,] the Lord accomplished a mighty deliver-
     ance for His people. At a time when it seemed that no power could save
     them, Esther and the women associated with her, by fasting and prayer
     and prompt action, met the issue, and brought salvation to their people.
       “A study of women’s work in connection with the cause of God in
     Old Testament times will teach us lessons that will enable us to meet
     emergencies in the work today. We may not be brought into such a
     critical and prominent place as were the people of God in the time of
     Esther; but often converted women can act an important part in more
     humble positions.”—Ellen G. White Comments, in The SDA Bible
     Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1140.

      Read Esther 4:14, Mordecai’s famous words to Esther: “ ‘Who
      knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as
      this?’ ” (NKJV). In what ways might the principle behind these
      words apply to you, right now?


                                                                           49

     Mordecai and Haman
According to Esther 5–8, how was Esther able to save her people?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       The accounts of Esther’s two banquets bring the story to its crisis
     point. They also record the great reversal of the plotted ethnic extermi-
     nation. On the way, the story exposes the difference between true honor
     and self-honor, and it records the punishment of the villain. These court
     intrigues had far-reaching consequences. They give us a glimpse into
     the behind-the-scenes workings of an absolute monarch and his court.
     Esther and Mordecai used their positions, their knowledge of the cul-
     ture in which they lived, and their faith in God’s covenant promises to
     His people to bring about their deliverance.
       Meanwhile, despite his quiet life of service, Mordecai let his faith be
     known, if through no other means than his refusal to bow down before
     Haman. People noticed, and they admonished him, but he refused to
     compromise his faith (Esther 3:3–5). This, surely, was a witness to
     others.

Read Esther 6:1–3. What does this tell us about Mordecai? What
     lessons could we draw about how God’s people can function, even
     witness, in foreign lands?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Though Mordecai obviously was following the Lord, nevertheless he
     showed allegiance, and loyalty, to the sovereign of the nation in which
     he lived. While refusing to bow before a man, he still was a good
     citizen, in that he exposed the plot against the king. Though we can’t
     read too much into the fact that he hadn’t been honored for this act,
     very possibly he did it and then just went on his way, not expecting any
     reward. In time, though, as the story shows, his good deed was more
     than rewarded. His example here is perhaps best expressed by these
     words: “ ‘Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and
     to God the things that are God’s’ ” (Matt. 22:21, NKJV).

     When Some Gentiles Became Jews
Read Esther 8. Focus specifically on verse 17. How can we understand
     this in terms of outreach and witness?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       No question, the book of Esther is not a “typical” story about out-
     reach and witness. And yet, we can see something like this scenario
     happening here toward the end. As a result of the king’s edict on behalf
     of the Jews, “many people of other nationalities became Jews because
     fear of the Jews had seized them” (Esther 8:17, NIV). Some commenta-
     tors argue that theirs could not have been a true conversion experience,
     since fear and anxiety should have no place in proselytizing. While
     that’s true, who knows in the longer run how these people, whatever
     their motives at first, might have responded to the working of the Holy
     Spirit, especially after seeing great differences between their beliefs
     and the belief and worship of the one true God?

Read Romans 1:18–20. How might the concepts taught here come into
     play with these people, especially in the context of this story?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       In the original decrees against the Jews, not only were the Jews to
     be killed, but the ones to do it were told that they should “plunder their
     possessions” (Esther 3:13, NKJV). Also, when the Jews were given per-
     mission to kill their enemies, they, too, were told that they could “plun-
     der” the possessions of their enemies (Esther 8:11, NKJV). However,
     three times in the book of Esther (9:10, 15, 16, NKJV) it specifically
     says that the Jews did not “lay a hand on the plunder” (NKJV). Though
     the texts don’t say why, the fact that it was mentioned three times shows
     the emphasis that was placed on this act. Most likely they refrained
     because they wanted it known that they were acting out of self-defense
     and not greed.

      How can we make sure that in our outreach and witness to oth-
      ers we don’t do anything that would cause people to question our
      motives? Why is this so important?
                                                                            51

Further Study: Ellen G. White, “In the Days of Queen Esther,” Prophets
      and Kings, pp. 598–606.

        “The decree that will finally go forth against the remnant people of
      God will be very similar to that issued by Ahasuerus against the Jews.
      Today the enemies of the true church see in the little company keeping
      the Sabbath commandment a Mordecai at the gate. The reverence of
      God’s people for His law is a constant rebuke to those who have cast
      off the fear of the Lord and are trampling on His Sabbath.”—Ellen G.
      White, Prophets and Kings, p. 605.

Discussion Questions:
        What parallel can we draw between the edict that was brought
       against the Jews and what will happen in the last days as the issue
       of the “mark of the beast” comes to the forefront?

        Both ancient Jews and Christians disputed the right of the book
       of Esther to have a place in the Old Testament canon. It did not
       appear in the Old Testament used by the community that produced
       the Dead Sea scrolls, nor in the Old Testament of the churches of
       ancient Turkey and Syria. The name of God does not appear in
       the book of Esther, while there are about 190 references to the
       heathen king. There are no references to sacrifice, temple, or wor-
       ship, although fasting and prayer are mentioned. Finally, the cove-
       nant emphasis on forgiveness and mercy is not mentioned. And
       yet, the Lord saw fit to include it in the canon. Why? What power-
       ful spiritual lesson can we take from it about how God can work
       in our lives for good, even amid what appear to be very difficult
       circumstances?

        Dwell more on the idea of times during which missionaries
       and others doing outreach do not openly talk about their identity
       and work. What are some valid reasons (if any) for us to do that,
       especially in the context of mission? Sometimes, for instance, mis-
       sionaries are very careful not to say who they are, especially in
       countries that are hostile to Christian witness. If we are impressed
       not to reveal right away who we are, how can we do it in a way that
       is not being dishonest or deceitful?

A Gift From the River: Part 2
by Doneshor Tripura, Bangladesh
   Doneshor felt a fervent desire to know the truth. He decided to mark with
a red pencil everything he found in the Bible and in the Bhagavad Gita that
was good and helpful. Soon he realized that he was marking nearly every-
thing in the Bible. Doneshor decided that one day he would be a Christian,
though he had no idea how or when that would happen.
   He entered college and had little time to read, but his desire to know God
never left him. When he returned home after college, he met an old friend
in the marketplace.
   “I’ve become a Christian,” his friend told him. Doneshor was thrilled. He
told him about finding the Bible in the river and then said, “Tell me how can
I become a Christian.”
   His friend’s face lit up, and he hugged Doneshor. Then he told him that
in a city about thirty miles [forty-five kilometers] away, there was a church
where Doneshor could learn how to become a Christian.
   Early Saturday morning, Doneshor boarded a bus to the town where the
church was located. He found the house church and went in. Everyone sat
with their eyes closed. Doneshor didn’t realize they were praying. He looked
at them. They look like normal people, he thought. When they opened their
eyes, they were surprised to see Doneshor standing near the door. They
welcomed him and invited him to join them.
   Doneshor attended the church as often as he could, but he couldn’t go
every week because the bus fare was expensive. But he felt great joy in what
he was learning and began telling his friends about it. Some wanted to visit
the church, too, so the little group agreed to take turns going, sharing the
expense of the bus fare. Then those who had gone could teach the others
what they had learned.
   For a year, Doneshor and his friends attended church this way. Then
Doneshor told the pastor that he wanted to be baptized. The pastor was
happy to arrange the baptism but apologized because the little church had
no baptistry. “We’ll have to baptize you in the Chengi River,” the pastor said.
   “That’s wonderful!” Doneshor responded. “The same river that brought
me the Bible will seal my covenant with God.”
   Doneshor and 24 others were baptized in the river where his quest for
God had begun. Among those other 24 were seven friends who Doneshor
had invited to learn about Christ. They are the first Christians among the
Tripura people.

  Doneshor Tripura studied theology at Bangladesh Adventist Seminary
and College in Bangladesh.

Read for This Week’s Study: 2 Tim. 1:8, 9; Dan. 9:24–27;
      Isa. 42:1–9; Luke 2:8–14; Matt. 10:5, 6; Acts 1:1–14.

      has sent me, I am sending you’ ” (John 20:21, NIV).



      A
              ccording to Scripture, a core activity of the Trinity is mission.
              Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are involved in saving humanity.
              Their Word began at the Fall and continues through until the end.
      Father, Son, and Holy Spirit will then restore this redeemed world to full
      unity with the divine will.
        According to the Gospels, Jesus underwent the radical change into
      human form necessary for His mission to succeed. In Jesus Christ, the
      meaning of history comes into focus, the total mission activity of God
      becomes coherent, and the deepest needs of humans for meaningful
      existence are fulfilled.
        In the New Testament, we are made acquainted with the purposes
      of the incarnation of Jesus Christ. We find here how He outlines the
      program for mission, and we get glimpses of how Jesus met people
      from other nations, people of other faiths. In the Word of God, we can
      see the incredible saving activity of God on behalf of fallen humanity.

     Jesus in the Old Testament
       “Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of
     me His prisoner, but share with me in the sufferings for the gospel
     according to the power of God, who has saved us and called us with
     a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own
     purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time
     began” (2 Tim. 1:8, 9, NKJV).
       Besides being great verses about the futility of salvation by works,
     these verses reveal the eternal nature of salvation; they show that the
     plan for our redemption had been formulated long, long ago.
       So, it is no wonder that all through the Old Testament, Jesus Christ is
     revealed in one way or another. Especially powerful are the prophecies,
     which clearly show that Jesus is indeed the Messiah.

Read the following Old Testament texts, all applied to Jesus. What
     do they say about Him and His role as Messiah? Isa. 61:1, Dan.
     9:24–27, Isa. 7:14, 9:6, 42:1–9.

       The prophet Isaiah describes the mission of Jesus with these words:
     “ ‘Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom I
     delight; I will put my Spirit on him, and he will bring justice to the
     nations. . . . I, the Lord, have called you in righteousness; I will take
     hold of your hand. I will keep you and will make you to be a covenant
     for the people and a light for the Gentiles, to open eyes that are blind,
     to free captives from prison and to release from the dungeon those
     who sit in darkness’ ” (Isa. 42:1, 6, 7, NIV).

      Dwell on the incredible idea that Jesus, the Creator, took upon
      Himself our humanity and in that humanity lived and died as He
      did. What great hope does this offer you in a world that, in and
      of itself, offers no hope at all?

      The Desire of Ages
         Jesus Christ is Lord of both the church and the world. His coming
      is a fulfillment of the Old Testament expectations of a saved com-
      munity that would extend far beyond the Jewish people. The coming
      of Jesus, especially His suffering and resurrection, ushered in a new
      age in which the distinction between Jew and Gentile, as far as the
      gospel is concerned, disappears. Jerusalem would remain the center,
      at least for a while. However, the point of departure was no longer
      Herod’s temple in Jerusalem, but the Jews converted to Christ; they
      had become the living temple. These Christian Jews would then be the
      “remnant” of Israel at that time in the early church, the ones called to
      bring the gospel to the world.
         This announcement of the worldwide, universal mission of Christ as

      and at His baptism.

        No question, Jesus came as the Savior for all humanity. What does
      this truth mean for us in the context of mission?
        “The missionary spirit needs to be revived in our churches. Every
      member of the church should study how to help forward the work of
      God, both in home missions and in foreign countries. Scarcely a thou-
      sandth part of the work is being done that ought to be done in mission-
      ary fields. God calls upon His workers to annex new territory for Him.
      There are rich fields of toil waiting for the faithful worker.”—Ellen G.
      White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 29.

     Mission to the Jews
       “ ‘I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel’ ” (Matt. 15:24, NIV).

        Between His first public appearance and His crucifixion, Jesus
     focused His ministry almost solely on the Jewish people, particularly
     in Galilee. The Lord addressed Himself first to Israel. Before the Cross,
     there are very few messages of good news to the Gentiles. Apparently,
     Jesus wanted to awaken the Jewish people to their place, purpose, and
     role in God’s overall mission for lost humanity. Israel was to have the
     opportunity to be the witness of God’s message to the world.

Read Matthew 10:5, 6. Why would Jesus say here what He did? How
     do we understand these words in the context of the universal scope
     of what Christ came to do and in the context of missions as a
     whole? Contrast this text with Matt. 28:19.

        When we consider the life and ministry of Jesus, we must observe
     a clear distinction between His thinking, ideals, principles, and plan-
     ning on one side and the way He accomplished these purposes on the
     other. In His day-to-day life and ministry, He identified Himself with
     Jewish culture, just as the Old Testament predicted of the Messiah.
     But the impact of His incarnation was universally applicable. Through
     His death and resurrection, He would bear the sins of the world (John
     1:29).
        We detect here an important biblical principle for establishing mis-
     sion. The first move is directed to creating a center in order to establish
     a strong and stable geographical and cultural base: Israel and the Jewish
     people. When that has been accomplished, mission should next develop
     outward from the center into ever-widening expanses.

      Think about your home church. How well does it model the ideas
      expressed above—that is, a strong and stable base that eventu-
      ally is able to reach out to others? How can you avoid the danger,
      which many churches face, of being self-oriented, worrying about
      your own needs to the neglect of witness and mission?

      Mission to the Gentiles
         Although Jesus spent the major part of His time among the Jews,
      serving them in their cultural context, He made clear in His teaching
      and ministry that His mission was universal. The gospel should be
      preached to the nations, with Israel as the initial base. The salva-
      tion of the Gentiles is part of God’s plan. It was embodied in Jesus’
      teaching.

How do the following teachings of Jesus indicate mission to non-Jewish
      people?

      Matt. 5:13, 14_____________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      Mark 14:9________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      Luke 14:10–24____________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      Matt. 13:36–43____________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        Despite the fact that Jesus ministered mainly among the Jews, there’s
      no question that from the very start His mission was for the whole
      world. Right at His baptism, John the Baptist said it clearly: “The next
      day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, ‘Behold! The Lamb
      of God who takes away the sin of the world!’ ” (John 1:29, NKJV).
      The word world (Greek kosmos) occurs about one hundred times in the
      Gospels. About half of these refer to the worldwide scope of Jesus as
      the Redeemer.

       In the parable Jesus told in Luke 14:16–24, those invited made all
       sorts of excuses for not coming. Read those excuses again. On one
       level, none appeared unreasonable, did they? What important
       lesson should we take from this for ourselves?

     The Great Commission
       Jesus spent the 40 days between His resurrection and ascension
     primarily in preparing the disciples and His church for worldwide
     evangelism.
       The best-known and most quoted resurrection account is Matthew’s.
     However, during this period there were other occasions during which
     the risen Christ could have given further details on the gospel commis-
     sion. There were two appearances in Jerusalem, two in Galilee (one by
     the Sea of Tiberias, one on the hilltop), and the meeting reported in
     Acts 1:1–14.

There are five structured occasions in the Gospels in which the Great
      Commission narrative is dealt with from various angles: on a
      mountain in Galilee (Matt. 28:16–20); at a table (Mark 16:14–16);
      in the upper room (John 20:19–23); on the beach (John 21:15–17);
      and just as Jesus was taken up into heaven (Acts 1:6–9). What key
      points do all these incidents have in common?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Under the power of the Holy Spirit and obeying the words of Jesus,
     the apostles quickly spread across the ancient world. Paul preached on
     the northern shore of the Mediterranean; Philip worked in Samaria.
     According to early Christian tradition, Matthew traveled to Ethiopia
     and Thomas to India.
        Though starting out small, and with so much opposition, through the
     grace of the Lord these faithful followers were able to spread the gospel
     message to the world. Whatever their faults, weaknesses, fears, doubts,
     and struggles, they accepted the call and worked for the salvation of
     the world. That is, what they learned about Jesus, what they got from
     Jesus, they sought to share with others. Isn’t that what being a Christian
     is all about?

       What have you been given in Christ? How should God’s gift to
       you through Christ influence your attitude toward witness and
       mission to others?




                                                                            61

Further Study: According to Matthew, Jesus foretold that “ ‘this gospel
      of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all
      nations, and then the end will come’ ” (Matt. 24:14, NIV). At the same
      time, the Scriptures make another point clear: “But of that day and hour
      knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only” (Matt.
      24:36). Note also Jesus’ words: “ ‘It is not for you to know the times or
      dates the Father has set by his own authority’ ” (Acts 1:7, NIV).
         Thus, while the good news of the gospel has been preached and is
      being preached as never before, and while we believe that Christ’s com-
      ing is soon, we must not get caught up in dates and speculating about
      dates. “We are not to be engrossed with speculations in regard to the
      times and the seasons which God has not revealed. Jesus has told his
      disciples to ‘watch,’ but not for a definite time. His followers are to be
      in the position of those who are listening for the orders of their Captain;
      they are to watch, wait, pray, and work, as they approach the time for
      the coming of the Lord.”—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book
      1, p. 189.

Discussion Questions:
        Despite the clear teaching on not setting dates for Christ’s
       return, hardly a year goes by before we hear something in the news
       about some group of Christians setting a date for Christ’s return.
       Why do you think people insist on doing this, other than as a good
       fund-raising technique? (After all, if Jesus is coming on June 19
       of next year [or fill in any date you want], then what good is your
       money now?) Why is it bad for the Christian witness in the world
       when these dates, year after year, are shown to be false?

        Think of the obstacles the early believers faced in the first few
       years of mission, especially considering that they were so small in
       number. What are some of the obstacles we face in mission today?
       What can we learn from the success of the early church that can
       help us to do what we have been so clearly called to do?

Faithful Bride: Part 1
  by Reena Murmu, Bangladesh
   Shanti was raised in a Christian home in Bangladesh. She was still quite
young when her father died. Her mother struggled to feed her family. When
Shanti was 13 years old, her mother gave her in marriage to a Hindu man.
   According to custom, when Shanti went to live with her husband’s fam-
ily, she was expected to take his religion. But Shanti refused. Her husband’s
family treated her badly, and everyone worked to separate Shanti from her
Christian faith. But Shanti clung to her God.
   Shanti was expected to serve her mother-in-law, who treated her as a slave,
shouting at her and denouncing her. Because Shanti refused to give up her
faith in God, she was considered unclean and not allowed to work with food
or utensils in the kitchen. But her mother-in-law made sure there was plenty
of other work for the girl to do.
   Shanti’s husband, Bhudroy, was much older than Shanti and treated her
kindly, but he was powerless to help his young bride, for he didn’t dare defy
his mother’s orders.
   There was no escape for the young bride because the couple was expected
to remain with the family until after the first child was born. Three years after
they married, their first daughter, Reena, was born.
   Shanti tried to share her faith with her husband whenever she could, and
over time he began to believe that Shanti was following the right religion. A
Seventh-day Adventist pastor lived in the same village as Shanti. He visited
the family and explained the church’s beliefs, hoping to make Shanti’s life a
bit easier. Shanti’s mother-in-law refused to listen to the pastor, but her father-
in-law listened. The pastor returned to visit the family often, sharing his faith
and Bible promises with the family members who were open to hearing them.
   As he worked in the village, the pastor found a number of people who were
interested in learning about the Bible. The pastor arranged to hold evangelistic
meetings. Without Shanti’s knowledge, her husband asked the pastor to study
the Bible with him. Then he was secretly baptized. Shanti didn’t know about
her husband’s interest until after he was baptized, but she was thrilled.
   Shanti’s mother-in-law, however, was very unhappy to learn that her son
had abandoned his gods to worship his wife’s God. She growled under her
breath when she saw Shanti and Bhudroy going to church together. She often
tried to prevent them from attending church. She would hide some household
valuable and demand that the couple find it before they went to church. These
searches often made the couple late.
   When her pranks no longer worked, Shanti’s mother-in-law turned to her
other daughter-in-law for help in breaking the spirits of Shanti and Bhudroy.
This daughter-in-law was selfish and often bickered and fought. She made life
bitter for everyone.

      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: John 4:4–30, Matt. 8:5–13,
      Mark 5:1–20, Matt. 15:21–28, Luke 17:11–19, John 12:20–32.

Memory Text: “ ‘Behold! My Servant whom I have chosen, My Beloved
      in whom My soul is well pleased! I will put My Spirit upon Him,
      and He will declare justice to the Gentiles’ ” (Matthew 12:18, NKJV).



      H
              ow interesting that Jesus spent so much of His earlier years in
              Galilee, known as “Galilee of the Gentiles” (Matt. 4:15), no
              doubt named because of the non-Jewish influence in the prov-
      ince. In this region, in Nazareth, Jesus spent the majority of His years
      before starting His public ministry. Thanks to its position, Nazareth was
      near major routes traveled by Roman army units, as well as merchant
      caravans. As a result, Jesus must have been in contact with non-Jews
      His whole early life (not to mention the time in Egypt).
        After His rejection in Nazareth (see Luke 4:16–31), Jesus centered
      His ministry in the cosmopolitan Galilean city of Capernaum. Contacts
      with Gentiles and their world significantly impacted His ministry and
      teaching. Even though He focused on Israel, the wider world was His
      concern. During the more than three years of His ministry between
      His baptism and ascension, on at least six occasions Jesus had direct
      contact with persons from Gentile nations. We will look this week at
      the Gospel accounts of these contacts.

     The Samaritan Woman
        In the time of Jesus, ancient Israel was divided into three provinces:
     Galilee, Samaria, and Judea. Samaria was situated between Galilee and
     Judea. The Samaritans worshiped the God of Israel, but they also wor-
     shiped pagan gods imported from foreign lands. As an initial mission
     field, Samaria was ideal for the apostles because it was geographically
     close to Israel.

Read John 4:4–30. What can we learn from this story about how Jesus
     witnessed to non-Jews? In what ways did Jesus step outside the
     bounds of tradition in order to reach out to this woman?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        The Samaritan woman was alert, well-informed about the history of
     her people, and asked intelligent questions. She led the conversation
     with her questions. Jesus, however, responded to her questions and
     statements with the things that would benefit the woman spiritually.
     The only point where Jesus changed the conversation was when He
     told her to bring her husband, knowing that she wasn’t married but had
     been with several men. Of course, asking her to do this opened the way
     for Him to reach out to her, however uncomfortable she had become.
     Nevertheless, by doing this, He was able to witness to her in a power-
     ful way.
        Also, we shouldn’t miss what happened in John 4:27. The disciples
     were surprised because Jesus was talking with this foreign woman. Jesus
     transgressed a few Jewish customs: first, asking a Samaritan woman to
     give Him a drink; second, being alone with her. In Israel, a man could
     not be seen alone with a woman unless she was a family member. Jesus
     followed Jewish customs when in Israel. However, in Samaria, He was
     outside Jewish territory and not bound by Jewish traditions, even though
     as we have seen elsewhere, Jesus distinguished between human-made
     traditions and the commands and precepts of God.

      How far out of your own “comfort zone” are you willing to go in
      order to minister to others? How far should you go?

     The Roman Army Officer
Read Matthew 8:5–13 (see also Luke 7:1–10). What does this story
     teach us about how even the largest cultural divides can be
     breached for the sake of the gospel?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        In Capernaum, a Roman officer of centurion rank (commander of
     100 men) sought out Jesus. The Jews resented the occupying Roman
     army, and many Romans hated the Jews. Despite this vast cultural and
     political divide, we can see the close relationship here between this
     Roman and the Jews.
        In Luke’s account, he said that the centurion went to the “elders of
     the Jews” (Luke 7:3, NIV) to ask them to bring Jesus. And, fascinatingly
     enough, they did just that, asking Jesus to come heal the man’s servant.
     Who were these elders? The text doesn’t say, but it seemed to have
     related to Jesus differently than did some of the other leaders.
        Meanwhile, the centurion was obviously a man of faith; his words
     to Jesus, “speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed” (Matt.
     8:8), were an incredible testimony to his belief in Jesus. The centurion
     “did not wait to see whether the Jews themselves would receive the One
     who claimed to be their Messiah. As the ‘light, which lighteth every
     man that cometh into the world’ (John 1:9) had shone upon him, he
     had, though afar off, discerned the glory of the Son of God.”—Ellen G.
     White, The Desire of Ages, p. 317.
        The centurion understood and respected Jewish religious sensitivi-
     ties. He knew that according to law a Jew was not allowed to enter a
     Gentile’s house; so, he requested that Jesus minister from a distance.
     The servant was healed. The faith of the Gentile centurion was
     rewarded. Jesus pointed out that the centurion was a prototype of the
     great day when people from all over the world would join the Jewish
     patriarchs at the Messianic banquet.

      Whatever else one can take from the accounts of this healing, we
      can see that vast cultural divides were not able to keep the Jews
      and this Roman apart. What lessons can we take from this about
      how we must learn to transcend whatever cultural differences we
      can (in good conscience) in order to reach out to others?

     Dealing With Demons
Read Luke 8:26–39 and Matthew 15:21–28. How do these stories help
     us understand how Jesus related to non-Jews? How do we under-
     stand Jesus’ words to the Canaanite woman? Also, what lessons
     should the disciples have picked up, seeing Jesus minister to those
     who were not part of the “covenant people”?

       The region of the Gadarenes was an area formerly dominated by
     Greece, but it had become part of the Roman province of Judaea. The
     man in the tombs was obviously possessed, and his possession mani-
     fested itself in horrific ways. He truly needed divine aid, which he got.
       That this liberation took place in Gentile territory is confirmed
     by the presence of the pigs. It is interesting to notice the reaction to
     this economic loss when the pigs drowned; the townspeople asked
     Jesus to leave their territory. Jesus in turn asked the healed man to
     stay. He was to witness to his own people about Jesus; no doubt,
     too, his changed life, even more than his words, would be a power-
     ful testimony.
       In the next incident, the child in the region of Tyre and Sidon was
     “ ‘demon-possessed and suffering terribly’ ” (Matt. 15:22, NIV). Her
     mother, a Canaanite, illustrated the cultural melting pot of that region.
     Her Canaanite ancestors were displaced from their land when Israel
     inherited it under the leadership of Joshua. Here, again, we see Jesus
     reaching out to those who weren’t of Israel proper.
       In talking to her, Jesus used somewhat harsh language, likening her
     people to dogs, but it tested her faith and showed her humble willing-
     ness to get the help she needed.
       “The Saviour is satisfied. He has tested her faith in Him. By His
     dealings with her, He has shown that she who has been regarded as an
     outcast from Israel is no longer an alien, but a child in God’s household.
     As a child it is her privilege to share in the Father’s gifts. Christ now
     grants her request, and finishes the lesson to the disciples.”—Ellen G.
     White, The Desire of Ages, p. 401.
       The lesson was that, contrary to their understanding, the work of the
     gospel is not just for the Jews but is to go to other nations, as well.

                                                                            67

     Ten Lepers
Read Luke 17:11–19. What lessons are here for us, regardless of our
     nationality or origins?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Notice first that the unfortunate men all knew Jesus. They called
     Him by both name and title, pleading for intervention. What’s fascinat-
     ing, too, is that they were not cleansed right then and there. They were
     told simply to go and present themselves to the priests, as specified in
     Leviticus 14:2. The fact that they just turned around and went showed
     that they believed in Him and His power to heal them.
       Only the Samaritan, though, expressed appreciation for what Jesus
     had done. The nine did not forget to go to the priests, but they neglected
     to give thanks to their Healer. The Samaritan, as the text reads, turned
     around even before he got to the priests. Though the text doesn’t say
     that the other nine were Jews, the location makes it very likely; besides,
     the fact that Luke specifically mentioned that he was a Samaritan, and
     that Jesus called him “this stranger” (Luke 17:18), makes it likely that
     the other nine were, indeed, Jews. Although Jews normally had no
     dealings with the Samaritans, their malady transcended those barri-
     ers. Common misfortune and tragedy, what Albert Schweitzer termed
     “the fellowship of suffering,” had broken down an ethnic divide. Their
     common need for cleansing, healing, and saving had brought them,
     collectively, to Jesus.
       Nevertheless, Samaritans and other foreigners were not the
     immediate goal for Jesus’ ministry—“ ‘I was sent only to the lost
     sheep of Israel’ ” (Matt. 15:24, NIV). He planned first to establish
     a strong mission base among the Jews. Throughout His ministry,
     however, He gave His followers evidence that the gospel should go
     to the whole world. Although this point became clear only after His
     resurrection, even before then Jesus did things that were to open the
     minds of the disciples to the idea that world mission would become
     their main task.

      Though all these men showed faith, only one turned around and
      thanked the Lord for what he had received. What does this tell
      us about the reasons that praise and thanksgiving are so impor-
      tant for faith? What are the things you have to be thankful for?
      Think about how much happier you’d be if you constantly kept
      them before you, and what better way than by thanking God for
      all that you have to be thankful for?

The Greeks and Jesus
  “Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to wor-
ship at the festival. They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida
in Galilee, with a request. ‘Sir,’ they said, ‘we would like to see
Jesus.’ Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip in turn told
Jesus. Jesus replied, ‘The hour has come for the Son of Man to be
glorified’ ” (John 12:20–23, NIV). How does this incident help us to
understand the heartfelt cry of people everywhere for salvation, for
hope, for answers that can be found only in Jesus?

_________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________

  These Greeks were probably converts to Judaism, since they came to
Jerusalem to worship at the feast. Commentators have noted that these
Greeks went to Philip, who, though Jewish, had a Greek name, which
might have attracted them to him. Thus, while pioneering Christian
work can be accomplished by foreign missionaries who have cultural
sensitivity and a sympathetic understanding of the people they want
to win for Christ, the most effective groundbreaking work is done by
people with the same background as the target people.
  The Greeks came only days before Jesus’ crucifixion. They no doubt
were amazed by His words about His suffering, death, and final vic-
tory. (The voice from heaven gave them something to think about, as
well.) Jesus would have been encouraged by their desire to “see” Him.
Their approach signaled the beginning of world evangelization. It was
acknowledged even by the Pharisees, who had exclaimed, “ ‘The world
has gone after Him’ ” (John 12:19, NKJV).
  What we see here are men, outside of Judaism, wanting to come
to Jesus. What a sign that the world was ready for His atoning death!
These Greeks, representing the nations, tribes, and peoples of the
world, were being drawn to Him. Soon the Savior’s cross would draw
the people of all lands and in all subsequent times to Him (vs. 32). The
disciples would find the world ready to receive the gospel.

 Read John 12:20–32. What is Jesus saying about losing your
 life in order to keep it? Why would He say that in this immedi-
 ate context? How have you experienced just what He is talking
 about?




                                                                     69

Further Study: “ ‘I say to you that many will come from the east and
     the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac
     and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But the subjects of the kingdom
     will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping
     and gnashing of teeth’ ” (Matt. 8:11, 12, NIV). Though these words
     were spoken in a particular context, in reference to a particular people,
     we shouldn’t miss the principle. Those who have been given great
     privileges, great advantages in terms of spiritual and theological truths,
     need to be careful. It’s easy to become complacent about truths that we
     have been given, truths that in some cases no one else is preaching and
     teaching. First, we need to make sure that we keep ourselves grounded
     in these truths; then, second, we need to be willing to teach these to
     those who don’t know them.

Discussion Questions:
       The Cross has shown us the absolute universality of all human-
      ity. Before God we are all sinners, and we all need grace for
      salvation. Nevertheless, many groups often do see themselves as
      superior to others. This is common and has been all through his-
      tory. What about yourself and your own ethnic, social, financial,
      or cultural group? In what ways do you harbor (and don’t fool
      yourself—you do harbor) a sense of superiority to others different
      from you? What’s wrong with that attitude, and how can you learn
      at the foot of the Cross to change it?

       The woman at the well went back and witnessed to her own
      people about Jesus. What does this teach us about missions and
      the importance of using those of a particular culture to reach their
      own people?

       The Greeks wanted to see Jesus. No doubt they had heard
      about Him or had themselves seen some of the things He had
      done. Jesus, of course, is now in heaven, and the church, His
      people, represent Him here on earth. What does this mean for us
      in terms of the kind of life we live and the kind of witness we pre­
      sent?

Faithful Bride: Part 2
  by Reena Murmu, Bangladesh

   A year after Bhudroy became a Seventh-dayAdventist Christian, his elder
brother died. Then Shanti became seriously ill with malaria. She didn’t
respond to medicines, and she became increasingly ill. When the fever left,
Shanti’s mother-in-law accused her of pretending to be ill. Shanti pleaded
with God, “Why are You allowing me to suffer so in this family?” Even her
husband grew discouraged and blamed God for their troubles.
   Shanti’s mother learned of her daughter’s grave illness from some other
villagers, so she set out to see her daughter. Shanti’s mother-in-law greeted
Shanti’s mother with a demand: “Take her home with you. She is no good to
us.” Shanti’s mother took her daughter home, but her baby, Reena, remained
with Shanti’s husband and mother-in-law.
   Shanti’s mother took her to the hospital, where doctors could treat her prop-
erly. Meanwhile Shanti’s mother-in-law was sure that Shanti would die and
began looking for a new wife for Bhudroy. But Bhudroy told them he was not
interested in marrying someone else.
   In time, Shanti recovered from her illness but, instead of returning to her
mother-in-law’s home, she stayed with her mother.
   Meanwhile her sister-in-law, whose husband had died, demanded that she
be given her share of the family’s land for her three sons. While she had a
right to the family land, her demand put her parents-in-law into crisis, because
they could not survive without their land. The selfish daughter-in-law wanted
everything she could get for herself and her sons. Slowly Shanti’s mother-in-
law realized that Shanti had been a faithful daughter-in-law while her other
daughter-in-law had been selfish and demanding. She asked Bhudroy to go
bring Shanti home.
   Bhudroy went to visit Shanti. He told her of his mother’s change of heart
and invited her to return home with him. Shanti was eager to see her little girl
again. She packed her things and returned with her husband.
   She was overjoyed to find that her mother-in-law had changed so much.
The older woman welcomed Shanti back into the home and treated her with
respect and kindness. Shanti was determined to be the best Christian she
could, hoping that her once cruel mother-in-law would give her life to Jesus.
Several years later, Shanti’s mother-in-law gave her life to Christ before she
died.
   Bhudroy also renewed his commitment to Christ, and now the family lives
together in peace as Christians. The faithful young bride had survived trials
and taunting and led her husband and parents-in-law to Jesus.

   Reena Murmu is the eldest daughter of Shanti and Bhudroy. She would
like to become a physician.

      Peter and the Gentiles




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Acts 2:5–21; 10:1–8, 23–48;
      Rom. 2:14–16; Acts 10:9–22; 11:1–10; 15:1–35.

Memory Text: “Then Peter said to them, ‘Repent, and let every one
      of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of
      sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise
      is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as
      the Lord our God will call’ ” (Acts 2:38, 39, NKJV).



      P
             eter was the first apostle to proclaim salvation to the Gentiles.
             He continued to provide leadership in the church for a number of
             years after its foundation, even after Paul became the missionary
      to the Gentiles par excellence. Peter, together with Paul, helped the
      early church and its leadership, mostly Jews, understand the universal-
      ity of the Great Commission.
         Peter worked to bring about an integrated church, uniting Gentile
      converts, who were unaware of the finer points of Jewish culture, and
      Jewish converts whose customs tended to take on the character of
      divine absolutes. Like all pioneer missionaries, Peter had to discrimi-
      nate between unchangeable divine absolutes and those practices that
      are cultural and relative and of no important consequence in the life
      of the believer, whether Jew or Gentile. Thus, it was Peter who, at the
      Jerusalem Council, declared of the Gentiles that God “put no difference
      between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith” (Acts 15:9) and
      who helped work through the issues that threatened the early church’s
      unity.

     Peter at Pentecost
       Jesus’ last words before His ascension were of a missionary nature:
     “Ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea,
     and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth” (Acts 1:8).
     Here, again, we see the mandate to spread the gospel into all the world.
     Only ten days later, this calling started to unfold, with Peter playing a
     key role.

Read Acts 2:5–21. How does this event show God’s intent for the gos-
     pel to go worldwide and the role that the Jews were to have in that
     proclamation?

     _________________________________________________________

        The Great Commission found its first fulfillment on the Day of
     Pentecost. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit had as its aim the evan-
     gelization of the world. This initial outpouring of the Holy Spirit gave
     great results on the Day of Pentecost. This was, however, only a fore-
     taste of much greater results to come in the years that followed.
        Peter’s sermon contained a few main points that remain relevant even
     today:
        First, Old Testament prophecies and promises are fulfilled in Christ
     (Acts 2:17–21), a truth revealed through the powerful works and signs
     accompanying His ministry, as well as through His death and resurrec-
     tion (vss. 22–24).
        Second, Jesus was exalted, placed at God’s right hand, and is now
     Christ (the Messiah) and Lord of all (vss. 33–36). In Him, all who
     repent and are baptized will receive forgiveness for sins (vss. 38, 39).
        Here we see the active and vocal disciple Peter standing up for
     his belief in Jesus. He was called by Jesus to be a strong leader in
     the church’s earliest days. Although less cosmopolitan, efficient, and
     adaptable to other cultures and religions than was the apostle Paul (see
     Gal. 2:11–14), Peter opened the way for the gospel to go to about fif-
     teen nations, as he preached to Diaspora Jews in Jerusalem. In this way,
     he used a very important bridge to bring the good news to the Middle
     Eastern world of his time.

      What does the story of Pentecost reveal about our utter need of
      the Holy Spirit in our lives? What choices can we make in order
      to be more attuned to the Spirit’s leading?


                                                                           73

      The Conversion of Cornelius: Part 1
Read Acts 10:1–8, 23–48. What does the story of this Gentile becoming
      a follower of Jesus teach us about salvation and witness?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        The conversion of Cornelius, a pagan officer in the Roman army
      along with his household, has been termed the Gentile Pentecost. It is
      a crucial story in Acts, one that addresses the most divisive issue fac-
      ing the early church: Can a Gentile become a Christian without first
      becoming a Jew?
        The Roman army’s headquarters for all of Judea, including Jerusalem,
      was Caesarea. Cornelius would have been one of six centurions com-
      manding the 600 soldiers that made up the Italian cohort based there.
      His name indicated his descent from an illustrious Roman military
      family that had earlier produced the commander who had defeated
      Hannibal, a Carthaginian general who wreaked havoc against Rome for
      years. More important, Cornelius was a God-fearing man who enjoyed
      spiritual fellowship with his family, prayed regularly, and was generous
      to those who were needy. God heard his prayers and sent an angel with
      a special message to him.
        “Believing in God as the Creator of heaven and earth, Cornelius
      revered Him, acknowledged His authority, and sought His counsel in all
      the affairs of life. He was faithful to Jehovah in his home life and in his
      official duties. He had erected the altar of God in his home, for he dared
      not attempt to carry out his plans or to bear his responsibilities without
      the help of God.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 133.
        Notice, too, what happened when Cornelius finally met Peter. He
      bowed down and worshiped him, an act that must have appalled Peter.
      Thus, what we can see is that this Gentile, favored of God, a devout
      man, still had a lot of truth to learn, even at the most basic level; no
      doubt, though, he was about to learn it.

       What are some of the traits of Cornelius, even in his ignorance,
       that we all would do well to follow in our own spiritual lives?

      The Conversion of Cornelius: Part 2
         “Then Peter began to speak: ‘I now realize how true it is that God
      does not show favoritism but accepts from every nation the one who
      fears him and does what is right’ ” (Acts 10:34, 35, NIV). Though these
      words to us are not that revolutionary, for them to have come from the
      mouth of Peter was an astonishing confession. We have to remember
      who Peter was, where he came from, and the attitudes that he had and
      still struggled with. (See Gal. 2:11–16.) No doubt, though, his experience
      with Cornelius helped him see even more clearly the error of his ways
      and helped him get a better picture of what God had intended to do with
      the gospel message.

Read Acts 10:33. What did Cornelius say to Peter that showed that
      he understood, even despite so much ignorance, that following the
      Lord also meant obeying Him?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

Read Acts 11:14. What does it say that shows us the need to spread the
      gospel, even to such godly men like Cornelius?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

How does Romans 2:14–16 help us to understand what was going on
      with Cornelius?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        As we have seen, Cornelius was a Gentile who “feared God” (Acts 10:2),
      though he still had a lot to learn (don’t we all?). Nevertheless, his fasting,
      his praying, and his giving of alms all revealed a heart open to the Lord;
      and thus, when the time was right, God worked miraculously in his life.
        An important point to remember in this account is how, though
      an angel appeared to him, the angel didn’t preach the gospel to him.
      Instead, the angel opened the way for Cornelius to meet Peter, who then
      told him about Jesus (see Acts 10:34–44). We can see here an example
      of how the Lord uses humans as His messengers to the world.
                                                                                75

     Peter’s Vision
       As we saw yesterday, by the time Peter made contact with Cornelius,
     he had a change in attitude regarding the Gentiles that other Jewish
     believers hadn’t yet understood (see Acts 10:44, 45). What happened
     that changed Peter?

Read Acts 10:9–22 and 11:1–10. What do the passages say about how
     entrenched Peter’s wrong attitudes were that it took something like
     this to open his mind?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Cornelius’s conversion and Peter’s role in the witnessing task were
     so important for the mission of the church that God communicated in a
     supernatural way with both the missionary and the missionary’s even-
     tual host: while an angel visited Cornelius, Peter was given a vision.
        Also, Peter stayed in Joppa with a tanner (Acts 9:43; 10:6, 32), a
     detail that we don’t want to miss. Tanning and tanners were repulsive
     to the Jews since they handled dead bodies and used excreta in their
     processes. Tanneries were not allowed in towns; note that Simon’s was
     located “by the sea side” (Acts 10:6).
        Peter’s stay with a tanner indicated that already, before his vision, he
     realized that some of his previous attitudes were at cross-purposes with
     the gospel. Both Peter and the family of Cornelius needed to shed some
     cultural baggage. All people, represented by “all kinds of . . . animals”
     (NKJV) in Peter’s vision, are God’s children.
        Peter’s call to witness to Cornelius implied that, although all
     people are acceptable to God, not all religions are equally acceptable.
     Cornelius was already a “religious” man, like nearly everyone else in
     ancient society. As a soldier, he would be acquainted with the worship
     of Mithra, and as an officer, he would have taken part in emperor wor-
     ship. But these were not acceptable to God.
        There is a lesson here today for those who approach non-Christian
     religions on the basis of equality with Christianity. Although sometimes
     it is done in a spirit of political correctness, such an attitude leads to a
     watering-down of the biblical claims of Christian uniqueness and finality.

      How do we show respect for people whose faith we believe is
      wrong, without giving the impression that we respect those
      beliefs ourselves? What is the difference between respecting
      people as opposed to respecting their beliefs?

     The Jerusalem Decree
       Early success of the mission to the Gentiles raised some crucial
     questions for the early church regarding what requirements should
     be expected of Gentile converts—those grafted into the faith (Rom.
     11:17). Tensions always appear when people from other religions and
     cultures join an established believing community. In this case, Jewish
     Christians, with their high regard for the requirements of the Old
     Testament laws and rituals, assumed that Gentile converts would accept
     and obey these laws and rituals. The main focus was circumcision, the
     fundamental indication of entry into the Jewish community for males,
     symbolizing compliance with all the requirements of Judaism. Should
     Gentile converts to Christianity be required to undergo circumcision?
     Some Jewish Christians in Judea certainly thought so and stated their
     conviction in stark theological language: to them it was essential for
     salvation.

What happened at the Jerusalem Council that helped settle this
     important issue? Acts 15:1–35.
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Although the question of circumcision was the main reason for
     the Jerusalem Council, it dealt with a range of cultural practices that
     the gospel did not require of its converts. The decree of the council
     (vss. 23–29) provided a common platform where Jewish and Gentile
     Christians could coexist in fellowship. Jewish core values were
     respected, but Gentiles were allowed to avoid circumcision. The coun-
     cil’s decision was both practical and theological. It set a pattern for the
     church to deal with issues and problems before they became too divi-
     sive. Experienced missionaries learn to identify core Christian belief
     issues and keep the focus on them as opposed to getting bogged down
     with things that are not essential to the faith.

      What lesson can we take away from the Jerusalem Council that
      could help the church today as it deals with controversial issues?
      What did they do that can serve as a model for us?




                                                                             77
                 F riday August 28

Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Jew and Gentile,” pp. 188–200,
     in The Acts of the Apostles.

        “Peter told of his astonishment when, in speaking the words of truth
     to those assembled at the home of Cornelius, he witnessed the Holy
     Spirit taking possession of his hearers, Gentiles as well as Jews. The
     same light and glory that was reflected upon the circumcised Jews
     shone also upon the faces of the uncircumcised Gentiles. This was
     God’s warning that Peter was not to regard one as inferior to the other,
     for the blood of Christ could cleanse from all uncleanness. . . .
        “Peter’s address brought the assembly to a point where they could
     listen with patience to Paul and Barnabas, who related their experi-
     ence in working for the Gentiles.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the
     Apostles, pp. 193, 194.

Discussion Questions:
       Peter’s vision has been explained to support the argument that
      the dietary laws of the Old Testament are no longer valid—specifi-
      cally, as justification for eating unclean meat. The meaning of the
      vision was clearly explained by Peter himself: “I should not call
      any [human] common or unclean” (Acts 10:28). The vision was
      not, therefore, about diet but about acceptance of other humans as
      God’s children, regardless of ethnicity, nationality, occupation, or
      religion. Why, though, do people use this as an argument in regard
      to diet? What should this tell us about how careful we need to be
      in how we handle Scripture?

       Dwell more on Romans 2:14–16. How should we as a church
      relate to this idea in terms of missions? That is, why do we need to
      preach to those who have the law written in their hearts?

       In Thursday’s study, we talked about the Jerusalem Council as
      a model for the church today. Read over the texts about the council
      (Acts 15:1–35). What are some specific things it did that provide a
      template for the church today? For instance, look at such things
      as (1) personal testimonies about witness, (2) the role of the gospel,
      (3) the role of the Scriptures, (4) the role of missions, and (5) how
      the people related to each other in the council.

Despair to Hope: Part 1
  by Chenghorn Thean, Cambodia

   Chen lived in a slum-like camp for displaced persons in Phnom Penh,
Cambodia.
   One day Chen walked past a house and heard someone speaking to
a group of people. Curious, she stared through a window. Was this a
church? She wanted to study English, and she had heard that churches
often teach English. She waited outside until the program ended. A man
walked out and introduced himself as Pastor Hang.
   “I want to learn English,” Chen said. Pastor Hang told her that an
English class met at the house church on Wednesday afternoons.
   On Wednesday afternoon, Chen returned for the English class. The
teacher started the class with prayer, and when the class ended, he
invited Chen to visit the church on Sabbath. She came to the worship
service but knew nothing about God and didn’t understand the sermon.
Nevertheless, she wanted to return. She continued studying English on
Wednesdays. Two weeks later, Pastor Hang invited Chen to a Bible class
on Friday afternoon. She enjoyed learning more about the Christian God
and invited Pastor Hang to come to her home to teach her.
   Chen told the pastor that she was having marital problems. She
explained that she and her husband were not legally married, and her
mother-in-law was trying to separate them so that her son could marry
a Chinese girl. The couple moved, but then her mother-in-law took their
two little sons and refused to allow Chen to see them.
   And then her husband began refusing to give her money from his
earnings to buy food. The pastor listened sympathetically to Chen’s sad
story; then he offered a possible solution. He had noticed that Chen was
a natural salesperson. He invited her to sell Seventh-day Adventist books
to earn some money. Chen agreed to try. The pastor continued to study
the Bible with her and led her to Jesus.
   He taught her how to sell the books. Chen followed his directions,
but she wasn’t able to sell any books. The best places to sell books are
in restaurants early in the morning and during the evening meals. But it
was the rainy season, and Chen could not get to these restaurants easily.
   When the rains stopped, Chen prayed, “God, if You are the true God,
if You want me to follow You, please show Your power by helping me to
sell some books tonight.” Then she set a goal to sell three or four books
for one dollar each.

      statements: Matthew 28:18–20, Mark 16:15, Luke 24:47–49, John
      20:21, and Acts 1:5–8. Together, they constitute the greatest assignment
      ever given to Christians. Among the commands was a geographical
      strategy for mission outreach, from its Jerusalem base to Judea and
      Samaria, then ultimately to the ends of the earth. This was a command
      that they, indeed, took seriously and set out to fulfill.
         This geographical strategy is prominent in the mission work of Philip
      the evangelist. According to Acts 8, his work extended outward from
      Jerusalem in expanding circles. That is, it kept spreading farther and
      farther as time progressed.
         Who was this Philip the evangelist? What does the Word of God tell
      us about him and the work that he did during the earliest days of the
      church? Finally, what lessons can we take away for ourselves from the
      inspired record of this early missionary?

Philip the Evangelist
  “We do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things
which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary,
but the things which are not seen are eternal” (2 Cor. 4:18, NKJV).
Think about what Paul is saying here, especially as we study this
week about Philip the evangelist, someone of whom we know little
except for the few references in the Bible. As we will see, though,
Philip did a good work, even though most of what he accomplished
we know little about. Who are some people whom you know of who
have done great things for God but with little outward recognition?
Why is it always important to keep the principle of Paul’s words in
mind, especially if we do a work that doesn’t garner much acclaim
or attention? See also 1 Cor. 4:13.

   Philip was a popular Greek name that means “horse lover.” In the
New Testament, there are four persons called by that name. Two had
the additional name “Herod” and were part of the Herodian ruling fam-
ily, which exerted a generally harsh rule over Israel in New Testament
times. The remaining Philips had outstanding roles in mission.
   The first, Philip of Bethsaida, was a disciple who was instrumental in
bringing Nathanael to Jesus (John 1:43–46). Later, he brought Greeks
to Jesus (John 12:20, 21).
   The second Philip was designated “the evangelist” in Acts 21:8,
to distinguish him from Philip the disciple. He first appeared in the
Jerusalem church as a “table waiter” (Acts 6:2–5) who turned evange-
list and missionary (Acts 8:12). His missionary service, extending over
twenty years and supplemented by his four prophesying daughters, is
mentioned in Acts. We know little else of his background.
   “It was Philip who preached the gospel to the Samaritans; it was
Philip who had the courage to baptize the Ethiopian eunuch. For a time
the history of these two workers [Philip and Paul] had been closely
intertwined. It was the violent persecution of Saul the Pharisee that
had scattered the church at Jerusalem and destroyed the effectiveness
of the organization of the seven deacons. The flight from Jerusalem had
led Philip to change his manner of labor, and resulted in his pursuing
the same calling to which Paul gave his life. Precious hours were these
that Paul and Philip spent in each other’s society; thrilling were the
memories that they recalled of the days when the light which had shone
upon the face of Stephen upturned to Heaven as he suffered martyrdom
flashed in its glory upon Saul the persecutor, bringing him, a helpless
suppliant, to the feet of Jesus.”—Ellen G. White, Sketches From the
Life of Paul, p. 204.

        No question, things were for a time going quite well among the early
     believers. Of course, everyone is fallen, and before long some tensions
     started to rise.

Read Acts 6:1–7. What problems arose, and how did the church deal
     with those problems?

     _________________________________________________________

       Rapid growth of the Jerusalem church brought with it social tension.
     Philip was appointed to a team to deal with it. Converts included under-
     privileged and economically challenged persons whose participation in
     the daily common meals placed increasing demands on church leaders.
     A murmuring about unfair distribution of food to Greek-speaking wid-
     ows emerged. This was especially sensitive because of reminders by the
     Hebrew prophets not to neglect widows and orphans.
       To resolve this serious issue, all twelve apostles gathered the believ-
     ers and proposed the appointment of seven men, full of the Holy Spirit
     and wisdom, who would literally “deaconize [Greek for “serve”]
     tables” so the Twelve could “deaconize the Word” (see Acts 6:3, 4).
     All seven had Greek names, perhaps indicating a balancing of welfare
     service for the neglected Greek-speaking widows. Among them was
     Philip—the first time that this Philip is mentioned in the Bible.
       The apostles argued that additional leadership was needed so that
     they should not be overworked by the administration of the resources
     necessary for communal life. They emphasized that their call was to
     devote themselves to the Word of God and to prayer.

      church, and how can you allow God to use you to help ease them?

     Philip in Samaria
       Saul, a future apostle and missionary, makes his first appearance in
     the Bible at the stoning of the deacon Stephen, the first Christian mar-
     tyr. This wave of persecution only helped to further spread the gospel.

Read Acts 8:1–6. What was the result of the persecution of the church
      in Jerusalem?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Samaria was the first stop on the geographical spread of Christianity.
     Samaritans considered themselves descendants of Israelites left behind
     when Assyria exiled most of the Israelites in 722 b.c. The Jews, how-
     ever, considered Samaritans to be descendants of foreigners that the
     Assyrians forcibly settled in Israel. Jewish-Samaritan relationships
     during the New Testament era were marked by tensions and outbreaks
     of violence. However, as we saw earlier, Jesus had already paved the
     way for mission work there when He dealt with the woman at the well,
     who, in turn, began to “evangelize” her own people.
       Philip’s call to wait on tables now became that of a missionary evan-
     gelist to the Samaritans. As a refugee fleeing religious persecution in
     Jerusalem, he did not waste his time. He proclaimed that the Messiah,
     awaited by both Jews and Samaritans, had come (Acts 8:5, 12).

Read Acts 8:6–15. How successful was Philip’s ministry in Samaria?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Philip was used mightily of the Lord in this early foreign mission
     field. The statement of the woman at the well, that “Jews have no deal-
     ings with Samaritans” (John 4:9, NKJV), had now become a thing of
     the past.

      What animosities, grudges, and prejudices that have poisoned
      your soul need to become “things of the past”? Isn’t it time to
      let it all go?


                                                                          83

      With the Ethiopian
         According to Acts 8:26–39, Philip’s next contact was with the
      Ethiopian treasury administrator, bringing mission another step toward
      “ ‘the end of the earth’ ” (Acts 1:8, NKJV). Philip was the link between
      Samaria and the Gaza mission. From Samaria, north of Jerusalem,
      Philip was called to Gaza, which is south of the city. His work in
      the north focused on a group; here it focused on a single person. In
      Samaria, Philip could proclaim Christ only from the five books of
      Moses, for this was all the Samaritans accepted; here he could also use
      the book of Isaiah, probably in Greek translation.

Read Acts 8:26–39. As you read, answer the following questions: What
      were the texts in Isaiah (from Isaiah 53) that the Ethiopian was
      reading, and why would they have given Philip the perfect oppor-
      tunity to evangelize him?

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

In contrast to Philip’s work in Samaria, where he did miracles (Acts 8:6),
      all he did with the Ethiopian was study the Bible. What point can
      we take away from this for ourselves as we minister to others?

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        The Spirit of the Lord called Philip away as soon as he had finished
      explaining the “good news about Jesus” and had baptized the Ethiopian.
      Philip had no opportunity to transmit his beliefs and teachings to his
      new convert. The Ethiopian was left to embrace the Christian faith in
      the context of his African culture, guided by the Old Testament and the
      Spirit of God, which had already been working in him, for he already
      was a worshiper of the Lord and a believer in His Word.

       Philip explained to the Ethiopian crucial Old Testament texts
       about the death of Jesus. Why must Jesus, His death and resur-
       rection, be central to the message we give to the world? What is
       our message without Him?

     Philip as Evangelist, Father, and Host
        Philip, clearly, was anointed to do the Lord’s work. Commentators
     are divided on what “the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip” (Acts
     8:39) means, whether he was simply told to go to Azotus (vs. 40) or
     was miraculously transported there. Either way, the crucial point for us
     is that Philip was a man surrendered to the Holy Spirit; and thus, God
     was able to use him to do a great work for Him.

Read Acts 8:40. What does it tell us about Philip that helps us to
     understand why he was named the “evangelist”?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

Read Acts 21:7–10. What can we learn about Philip from these few
     verses?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        At this stage of the story, we learn that Philip was a family man with
     four unmarried daughters. Philip’s call out of the deaconate into evange-
     lism involved him in extensive travel. We know about the journey from
     Jerusalem to Samaria, then on to Gaza, followed by “all the towns” on the
     50-mile (80-kilometer) coastline between Azotus and Caesarea. There
     were probably unrecorded journeys. Like all the pioneering missionar-
     ies, he would have been harassed, inconvenienced, and subjected to the
     “ups and downs” such commitments entail. Still, he managed his family
     to the extent that four daughters were deemed by the Holy Spirit suitable
     to receive the gift of prophecy. This testifies to good parenting and true
     godliness in this pioneering Christian missionary family.
        The text reveals that the apostle Paul stayed with Philip “a number of
     days” (vs. 10, NIV). Twenty-five years earlier, Paul, then named Saul,
     had been an aggressive and fierce persecutor of the Christians (Acts
     9:1, 2). His persecution of Jerusalem believers forced Philip to flee
     to Samaria (Acts 8:1–5). Now, years later, persecutor and persecuted
     meet in the home of Philip, who hosts Paul’s visit. What an interesting
     meeting of brothers and fellow workers with Christ in the great cause
     of bringing the gospel to the non-Jewish world!

      In our work for others, why is it so crucial to never forget our
      first obligation, our families?
                                                                            85

Further Study: Ellen G. White, “The Gospel in Samaria,” The Acts of the
      Apostles, pp. 103–111.

        “When they were scattered by persecution they went forth filled
      with missionary zeal. They realized the responsibility of their mission.
      They knew that they held in their hands the bread of life for a famish-
      ing world; and they were constrained by the love of Christ to break
      this bread to all who were in need.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the
      Apostles, p. 106.
        “And when His disciples were driven from Jerusalem, some found
      in Samaria a safe asylum. The Samaritans welcomed these mes-
      sengers of the gospel, and the Jewish converts gathered a precious
      harvest from among those who had once been their bitterest enemies.”
      —The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 106, 107.

Discussion Questions:
        As we’ve seen, the gospel breaks down barriers between
       people. At least, that is the ideal; the reality has at times been
       radically different. What is it about human beings, even among
       Christians—among those who understand that we are all the same
       before God, who understand that the Cross is the great equal-
       izer—that we allow cultural, social, and other barriers to divide
       us to the great extent that they still do? How can the Seventh-day
       Adventist Church, which is so universal, discourage such preju-
       dices?

        As we saw, the persecution of the early church caused believers
       to flee, and as a result, the gospel started spreading in ways that
       it might not have done without persecution. Though God was able
       to bring good out of it, we must remember that religious persecu-
       tion is never good, never right, never justified. What should our
       attitude be toward those who are facing religious persecution, even
       if we don’t agree with their religious beliefs? See Luke 6:31.

Despair to Hope: Part 2
  by Chenghorn Thean, Cambodia

   That night Chen sold five books for five dollars each. She was con-
vinced that God is the true God. But a month later, her husband told her
to stop selling books. “Your work is bringing shame on me,” he said.
   Chen’s husband demanded that she stop believing in Jesus and stop
selling books. “I can’t do that,” she told him. “I believe in Jesus; I have
seen His power at work. And I am selling books to feed myself because
you refuse to give me any money.”
   “If you refuse to give up this nonsense, I will leave you,” he said. But
Chen refused to give up her new faith. When she was baptized a few
months later, her husband left her and went to live with his mother and
his sons.
   For several years, Chen has tried to visit her sons, but she hasn’t been
allowed to see them. Although her life is difficult, Chen has not let her
personal troubles discourage her. She continues to sell literature to sup-
port herself and invites people to the church when they show interest in
the books she sells. When people are too poor to buy a book, she urges
them to come to the church to meet God. She shares her testimony with
them and testifies that God is faithful to those who trust Him.
   One woman who used to pay Chen to paint her nails asked Chen why
she had become a Christian. Chen smiled and told the woman that God
is a loving and powerful God, and He answers her prayers. As the two
women stood talking outside the woman’s home, the woman realized
that one of her precious earrings was missing. “We must find it!” the
woman said, feverishly searching in the dirt for the missing jewelry. “I
inherited this from my mother. I must find it.”
   The two women searched together for the earring. Chen knew that
if they didn’t find the earring, the woman might accuse Chen and the
church. The earring was found. The woman was so impressed that
Chen’s God could help her find her earring that she asked Chen to take
her to Chen’s church on Sabbath.
   Chen was crushed when her husband told her that he no longer wanted
her for his wife. But Chen put her trust in God; and recently she met
a Global Mission pioneer, and the two plan to marry. “Truly God has
provided for all my needs,” she says with a gentle smile.

      Paul: Background and Call




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Acts 9:1; Phil. 3:6, 8; 1 Cor. 15:9,
      10; Acts 9:1–22; 26:16–18; Gal. 2:1–17.

Memory Text: “But the Lord said to Ananias, ‘Go! This man is my
      chosen instrument to proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their
      kings and to the people of Israel. I will show him how much he must
      suffer for my name’ ” (Acts 9:15, 16, NIV).



      O
               ne of the most central figures in the New Testament was Paul,
               originally Saul of Tarsus. Paul was to the early Christian church
               what Moses was to the children of Israel. The difference is that
      while Moses brought God’s people out from the Gentiles in order that
      Israel would be able to do God’s will, Paul brought God’s Word from Israel
      to the Gentiles in order that the Gentiles could do the same; that is, to do
      God’s will.
         More is known about Paul than any other first-century Christian. He is
      especially remembered for his significant contributions that have influ-
      enced Christian outreach during the past two millennia. His missionary
      visits and activities to the nations around the Mediterranean Sea set a pow-
      erful example for Christian missions in coming generations.
         Paul is credited with lifting biblical absolutes from their Jewish culture,
      where civil, ritual, and moral laws were so integrated into the fabric of
      Jewish life that there was hardly any distinction between the Jewish cus-
      tom and what they thought was God’s everlasting message to the nations.
         This week we will take our first look at someone who, other than
      Jesus Himself, is thought by many to be the most important figure in
      the New Testament.

Saul of Tarsus
  Saul was born in Tarsus, an important town on the trade route
between Syria and western Asia (Acts 22:3). Tarsus was a multicultural
center of industry and learning and home for a short time to Rome’s
most famous orator and senator, Cicero.
  Saul’s parents were Diaspora Jews (Jews who were not living in
the land of Israel) from the tribe of Benjamin. His birth name was
Saul (Hebrew sha’ul, “asked for [of God]”)—though, after he began
his mission to the Gentiles (Acts 13:9), he took the name Paul (Latin
Paulus, name of a prominent Roman family). Also, since he was a
Pharisee, Paul probably had a wife, though we know nothing about her.
In fact, we don’t know much about his family at all, though a sister and
a nephew are mentioned (Acts 23:16). Paul was also a Roman citizen
(Acts 22:25–28).
  Saul was probably educated in a synagogue school in Tarsus until 12
years of age, followed by rabbinic study in Jerusalem with the famous
Rabban (this honorary title meant “our rabbi”) Gamaliel (vs. 3). Like
most Jewish males, he learned a trade—in his case, tent making (Acts
18:3).
  As already stated, Paul was a Pharisee (Phil. 3:5). The Pharisees
(meaning “separated ones”) were known for insisting that all the laws
of God, both those written in the books of Moses, as well as those
handed down verbally by generations of scribes, were binding on all
Jews. Their strict patriotism and detailed obedience to Jewish laws
could make them appear to their fellow Jews as hypocritical and judg-
mental. Paul, however, did not hide the fact that he and his father were
Pharisees (Acts 23:6).
  Paul’s pharisaic background was an important element in his success-
ful missionary work for both Jews and Gentiles. It equipped him with
detailed knowledge of the Old Testament, the only Scriptures available
to early Christians. It also acquainted him with the scribal additions to,
and expansions of, the Old Testament laws. He was thus the apostle best
qualified to discern between timeless, Scripture-based divine absolutes
on the one hand and later Jewish cultural additions, which were not
binding, and which therefore could be ignored by Gentile followers
of Jesus. As we have seen, this issue would become a very important
one in the life of the early church. Today, too, the role of culture in the
church creates issues for the church to address.

 Which of our Christian beliefs seem to conflict most sharply with
 the surrounding culture? How do you deal with the conflict with-
 out compromising what must never be compromised?

     Paul, the Man
       Personality traits are an individual’s typical responses to surround-
     ing domestic, cultural, or educational circumstances. Character is the
     combination of traits, qualities, and abilities that make up what sort of
     person an individual is.

Read Acts 9:1; Philippians 3:6, 8; 1 Corinthians 15:9, 10; 1 Timothy
     1:16; Galatians 1:14; and 2 Corinthians 11:23–33. What do these
     texts tell us about Paul’s character and personality?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Paul was clearly a man of great conviction and zeal. Before his
     born-again experience, he used his zeal to persecute the early church.
     He supported the stoning of Stephen (Acts 7:58), took the initiative in
     imprisoning Christian women, as well as men (Acts 8:3), made mur-
     derous threats against the disciples (Acts 9:1), and organized a raid on
     Christians in a foreign country (Acts 9:2, Gal. 1:13).
        At the same time, too, we can see how Paul’s zeal and fervency were
     to be used for good, as he dedicated his life to the preaching of the
     gospel, despite incredible hardships and challenges. Only a man totally
     dedicated to what he believed would have done as he did. And though
     he lost all things for Christ, he counted them as “rubbish,” which comes
     from a Greek word that means something that is useless, like garbage.
     Paul understood what was important in life and what wasn’t.
        Paul was also a humble man. No doubt, partly from the guilt of his
     former persecution of Christians, he viewed himself as unworthy of his
     high calling. And also as someone who preached the righteousness of
     Christ as our only hope of salvation, he knew just how sinful he was in
     contrast to a holy God, and such knowledge was more than enough to
     keep him humble, surrendered, and grateful.
        “One ray of the glory of God, one gleam of the purity of Christ, pene-
     trating the soul, makes every spot of defilement painfully distinct, and
     lays bare the deformity and defects of the human character. It makes
     apparent the unhallowed desires, the infidelity of the heart, the impurity
     of the lips.”—Ellen G. White, Steps to Christ, p. 29.

      None of us is immune to pride. How should focusing on the Cross
      and what it means cure anyone of that sin?

      From Saul to Paul
Read Acts 9:1–22, the story of Paul’s conversion. How was this experi-
      ence linked to his missionary calling? See also Acts 26:16–18.

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        Right from the start, it was clear that the Lord had intended to
      use Paul to reach both Jews and Gentiles. No other event in Paul’s
      preparation as missionary and theologian compared in importance to
      his conversion; indeed, often in his witness he would talk about that
      experience.
        “ ‘Now get up and stand on your feet. I have appeared to you to
      appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen and
      will see of me’ ” (Acts 26:16, NIV). Paul couldn’t preach or teach about
      what he didn’t know. No, instead he would preach and teach out of his
      own experiences with, and knowledge of, the Lord, all the time in har-
      mony with the Word of God. (See Rom. 1:1, 2.)

Read Acts 26:18. What would be the result of Paul’s work?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        From this we can see five results of authentic missionary work:
        1. Open people’s eyes. Make God and Jesus real, present, active, and
      appealing.
        2. Move from darkness to light, ignorance to knowledge—a core
      gospel theme. (See Luke 1:78, 79.)
        3. Turn from the power of Satan to God.
        4. Receive forgiveness of sins. The problem of sin has a solution.
      This is the living, healing, core message of Christians.
        5. Receive a place among the sanctified; this means membership in
      God’s church, regardless of ethnicity, gender, or nationality.

      Paul in the Mission Field
        “From Jerusalem and round about to Illyricum I have fully
      preached the gospel of Christ” (Rom. 15:19, NKJV). What crucial
      element for any kind of mission work can we find in this text? See
      also 1 Cor. 1:23, 2:2, Gal. 6:14, Phil. 1:15–18.
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         One thing is certain about all Paul’s missionary endeavors: no matter
      where he went, the preaching of Christ and Him crucified was central
      to his message. By making it so, he was being faithful to the call that
      Christ had first given him, that he should preach about Jesus. The mes-
      sage for missions today is obvious: whatever else we preach and teach
      (and as Seventh-day Adventists, we have been given so much that needs
      to be shared with the world), we must keep Christ and Him crucified at
      the front and center of all our outreach and mission work.
         Paul, though, didn’t preach Jesus just as some sort of objective truth
      and then go on his merry way. Central to his work was to raise up
      churches, to start Christian communities region by region throughout
      his part of the world wherever he could. In the truest sense, his work
      was “church planting.”
         There is another element to Paul’s missionary work, as well.

Read Colossians 1:28. What does it sound like Paul is saying? That is,
      is this evangelism or discipleship?

      _________________________________________________________

         If one reads many of Paul’s epistles, it’s clear that they often are not
      evangelistic, at least in the sense that we use the term, that of reaching
      out to the unchurched. On the contrary, many of the letters were written
      to established church communities. In other words, included in Paul’s
      missionary endeavors was the work of pastoral care, edification, and
      nurturing the churches.
         So, we can see at least three central elements to Paul’s missionary activ-
      ity: proclaiming Jesus, church planting, and nurturing established churches.

       Think about the last time you witnessed to someone, in whatever
       capacity. How central was Jesus to what you said? How can you
       make sure that you always keep Him central?

     Mission and Multiculturalism
        “Multiculturalism” is a recent term, first appearing in print in the
     1960s, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. For many ancient
     peoples, there were only two categories of humanity—us and them, our
     tribe and not our tribe. For Greeks, all non-Greeks were “barbarians.”
     For Jews, all non-Jews were “Gentiles.”
        As we have seen already, the success of the Gentile mission forced
     the infant church and its leaders to deal with the Jew/Gentile divide.
     The question, at heart, was whether a Gentile could become a Christian
     without first becoming a Jew.

Read Galatians 2:1–17. What happened here, and how does this
     account illustrate, in its own way, the challenge of “multicultural-
     ism” in outreach and mission?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        “When Peter, at a later date, visited Antioch, he won the confidence
     of many by his prudent conduct toward the Gentile converts. For a
     time he acted in accordance with the light given from heaven. He so
     far overcame his natural prejudice as to sit at table with the Gentile
     converts. But when certain Jews who were zealous for the ceremonial
     law came from Jerusalem, Peter injudiciously changed his deportment
     toward the converts from paganism. . . . This revelation of weakness
     on the part of those who had been respected and loved as leaders left
     a most painful impression on the minds of the Gentile believers. The
     church was threatened with division.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the
     Apostles, p. 198.
        Paul faced the issue with Peter and took a firm stand for what today
     could be called a multicultural church. His Gentile converts would not
     have to become Jewish in order to become Christian. Paul’s complex
     background as a devout Pharisee, student of Rabban Gamaliel, Roman
     citizen, fundamentalist persecuting zealot, and finally convert and
     apostle of Jesus Christ, eminently qualified him to distinguish timeless,
     unchanging divine absolutes on one hand and their temporary cultural
     and religious vehicles on the other.

      How do you distinguish between the essentials of our faith and
      purely cultural, social, or even personal preferences?



                                                                           93

Further Study: “I have become all things to all people so that by all
     possible means I might save some. I do all this for the sake of the gospel,
     that I may share in its blessings” (1 Cor. 9:22, 23, NIV).

        Read 1 Corinthians 9:19–23, NIV. Modern missiology applies
     the term “contextualization” to Paul’s mission methods stated here.
     Contextualization is defined as “attempts to communicate the Gospel
     in word and deed and to establish the church in ways that make sense
     to people within their local cultural context, presenting Christianity in
     such a way that it meets people’s deepest needs and penetrates their
     worldview, thus allowing them to follow Christ and remain within their
     own culture.”—Darrell L. Whiteman, “Contextualization: The Theory,
     the Gap, the Challenge,” International Bulletin of Missionary Research,
     vol. 21 (January 1997): p. 2.
        “The Jewish Christians living within sight of the temple naturally
     allowed their minds to revert to the peculiar privileges of the Jews as a
     nation. When they saw the Christian church departing from the ceremo-
     nies and traditions of Judaism, and perceived that the peculiar sacred-
     ness with which the Jewish customs had been invested would soon be
     lost sight of in the light of the new faith, many grew indignant with Paul
     as the one who had, in a large measure, caused this change. Even the
     disciples were not all prepared to accept willingly the decision of the
     council. Some were zealous for the ceremonial law, and they regarded
     Paul with disfavor because they thought that his principles in regard to
     the obligations of the Jewish law were lax.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts
     of the Apostles, p. 197.

Discussion Questions:
        Read 1 Corinthians 9:20. What lessons can we draw from these
       words that can help us to understand and contextualize how we do
       mission, or even how we can do personal ministry and witness?

        Despite Paul’s sinful, even shameful, past, God forgave Paul
       and used him in a mighty way. How can we learn to forgive our-
       selves for what we might have done and, claiming the righteous-
       ness of Christ as our own, seek to be used mightily of Him, as well?

The Stolen Sermons: Part 1
  by Gamini Mendis

   I wanted to call a meeting of all the clergy in my town in Sri Lanka. I
thought we needed to pray and fellowship together. I reviewed the list to be
sure I hadn’t forgotten any pastor. I knew that some of the clergy wouldn’t be
happy that I was inviting the Seventh-day Adventist pastor, for they thought
Seventh-day Adventists were part of a cult, but I wanted to include every
minister.
   I hadn’t met many of the clergy before, and it was a good chance to talk
with them. I was especially interested to learn more about the Seventh-
day Adventist Church. When the Adventist pastor told me that his church
worshiped on Saturday instead of Sunday, I was intrigued. But my inter-
est was for a purely selfish reason. I decided to visit the Seventh-day
Adventist church on Saturday and listen to the pastor’s sermons. Then I
could use his material to help me preach a sermon on Sunday. It would
save me a lot of work!
   The next Saturday I visited the Seventh-day Adventist church. I was
warmly welcomed by the pastor and his congregation. I listened closely
to the sermon and took careful notes. The following day, I preached the
same sermon I had heard in the Seventh-day Adventist church with just
a few minor changes. This makes my life so much easier, I thought. The
next Saturday, I went to the Seventh-day Adventist church again and
took notes from the sermon. I used those notes to preach to my congre-
gation on Sunday. The next week it was the same. Saturday night I went
to sleep smiling at my brilliant idea to save work.
   During the night, I awakened feeling a sudden sharp pain in my shoul-
der. I jumped up and turned on the light. I had been bitten by a snake.
My wife and I frantically searched for the snake in our room, but we
couldn’t find it. My wife took me to the hospital, but we couldn’t tell
the doctors what kind of snake it was so they were not able to give
me the right antivenom treatment. I lost consciousness, and the doctor
thought I had died.
   I was taken to the mortuary, and my brother brought a coffin. My fam-
ily and friends started weeping over my body. After some time, someone
touched me. Perhaps they felt warmth where the skin should have been
cold, but they checked and found I still had a weak pulse. Excitedly, they
rushed me into the hospital’s intensive care unit.
   To be continued in next week’s Inside Story.

      Paul: Mission and
      Message


      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: 1 Cor. 1:22–24, 1 Tim. 6:12,
      2 Tim. 4:7, 1 Cor. 15:12–22, Acts 15:38–41.

Memory Text: “Brethren, I do not count myself to have apprehended;
      but one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and reach-
      ing forward to those things which are ahead, I press toward the goal
      for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus” (Phil. 3:13, 14,
      NKJV).



      D   
               rawing on Old Testament prophetic messages, Jewish history,
               and the life and teachings of Jesus, Paul developed the Christian
               concept of salvation history, all centered on the life, death,
      and resurrection of Christ. Because of his cultural background in both
      Judaism and in Greco-Roman society, Paul possessed sufficient insights
      to allow him to lift the gospel out from the complexity of Hebrew civil,
      ritual, and moral practices of Jewish life and make it more accessible to
      a multicultural world.
         Paul’s 13 letters to the believers applied faith to their lives. He
      touched doctrinal, as well as practical, topics. He counseled, encour-
      aged, and admonished on matters of personal Christianity, relation-
      ships, and church life. Nevertheless, throughout his letters his main
      theme was “Jesus Christ and Him crucified” (1 Cor. 2:2, NKJV).
         Paul was not only a man of letters. He also became known as the
      apostolic missionary par excellence, witnessing to the gospel from
      Syria to Italy, perhaps even to Spain. Within a decade, Paul established
      churches in four provinces of the Roman Empire.
         This week we will take a look at Paul—both his mission and his
      message.

     Greeks and Jews
Read 1 Corinthians 1:22–24. How do these verses help us to under-
     stand the different ways people relate to truth? What can we learn
     here that can help us in our witnessing to various people groups?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        In the Exodus from slavery in Egypt, God worked remarkable signs
     of providential care for Israel. Later generations of Jews developed the
     expectation that any new messenger sent from God should make them-
     selves known by signs and wonders and miracles.
        In contrast, in line with their philosophical and scientific heritage,
     Greeks sought a rational basis for belief, one that would satisfy the
     demands of human wisdom.
        Paul did not dismiss the cultural and spiritual heritage of his target
     peoples but used it as an entry point for proclaiming Christ crucified.
     Those who desired signs found them in the life and ministry of Jesus
     and in the early church. Those who wanted logical elegance and ratio-
     nality found it in Paul’s arguments for the gospel message. Both types
     of persons ultimately had only one need, and that was to know the
     risen Christ and “the power of his resurrection” (Phil. 3:10). How Paul
     brought them to that knowledge depended upon the people to whom he
     was witnessing.
        When Paul preached to Jewish listeners, he based his sermons on
     the history of Israel, linking Christ to David, and emphasizing the Old
     Testament prophecies pointing to Christ and foretelling His crucifixion
     and resurrection (Acts 13:16–41). That is, he started out with what was
     familiar to them, with what they revered and believed, and from that
     starting point he sought to bring them to Christ.
        For Gentiles, Paul’s message included God as Creator, Upholder, and
     Judge; the entry of sin into the world; salvation through Jesus Christ
     (Acts 14:15–17, 17:22–31). Paul had to work from a different starting
     point with these people than he did with the Jews (or with Gentiles who
     believed in the Jewish faith). Here, too, though, his goal was to lead
     them to Jesus.

      Think about your own faith. On what is it based? What good
      reasons do you have for it? How might your reasons differ from
      those of other people, and why is it important to recognize these
      differences?


                                                                           97

      Soldiers and Athletes
         As a skilled communicator, Paul in his mission work used the familiar
      to explain the unfamiliar. He took everyday features of the Greco-Roman
      world to illustrate the practical reality of new life in Christ. He drew
      especially from two areas of his converts’ world for his teaching meta-
      phors—athletes with their games and the ever-present Roman soldier.
         Fondness for athletic accomplishments gripped Paul’s world, much
      as it does ours. Ancient Greeks transmitted their love of competition
      by holding, over the centuries, no fewer than four separate cycles of
      Olympic-type contests, located in different parts of Greece. Romans
      inherited and further promoted athletic competition. Foot races were the
      most popular events and included a race of men wearing full suits of
      military armor. Wrestling also was popular. Athletes trained assiduously,
      and winners were richly rewarded. Ethnicity, nationality, and social class
      mattered little, since endurance and performance were the goals.

What key lessons for the Christian life would Paul’s readers have
      found in the following passages? 1 Cor. 9:24–27, Gal. 5:7, 1 Tim.
      6:12, 2 Tim. 2:5.

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         Starting with Marius, Roman emperors replaced temporary soldiers
      with full-time career warriors, garrisoned them across the Roman
      Empire, and upgraded and standardized their armor and weapons. By
      Paul’s time, soldiers were recruited from various ethnic and national
      groups, whether or not they were Roman citizens. In return for rewards
      at the end of their term of service, soldiers pledged total loyalty to the
      ruling emperor, who in times of conflict personally led them into battle.

In the following passages, what comparisons did Paul make between sol-
      diering and the Christian life? 2 Cor. 10:4, 5; Eph. 6:10–18; 1 Tim.
      6:12; 2 Tim. 2:3, 4.

      _________________________________________________________

         In what is perhaps Paul’s final letter, he applied both soldiering and athlet-
      ics to his own view of his life as a Christian missionary: “I have fought the
      good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith” (2 Tim. 4:7, NIV).

       In what ways is faith a fight and in what ways a race? How
       have you experienced the reality of both metaphors in your own
       Christian life? Which metaphor best describes your own experi-
       ence, and why?

     Paul and the Law
       “Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we
     uphold the law” (Rom. 3:31, NIV). What law must Paul be talking
     about here?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       In English translations of Paul’s letters, the word law appears about
     one hundred thirty times, and in Acts of the Apostles, about twenty
     times. Paul endeavored to get his hearers and readers, regardless of
     cultural background, to understand that “law” carried several meanings,
     especially for Jews. Laws such as the Ten Commandments are in force
     for all people at all times. But other kinds of laws in the Old Testament
     and in Jewish culture, Paul did not consider in force for Christians.
       In his writings, the apostle used the word law broadly in reference to
     rules for religious ceremonies, civil law, health laws, and purification
     laws. He wrote about being “under the law” (Rom. 3:19) and about being
     “released from the law” (Rom. 7:6, NIV). He described a “law of sin” (vs.
     25) but also “law [that] is holy” (vs. 12). He mentioned the “law of Moses”
     (1 Cor. 9:9) but also the “law of God” (Rom. 7:25). Confusing as these
     phrases may seem to non-Jews, for the Jewish believer brought up in the
     Hebrew culture, the context would make clear which law was meant.

Read Romans 13:8–10; Romans 2:21–24; 1 Corinthians 7:19; Ephesians
     4:25, 28; 5:3; 6:2. How do these verses help us to understand that God’s
     moral law, the Ten Commandments, was not nullified at the Cross?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Paul realized that the ceremonial laws, detailing how one approached
     God through priesthood, Hebrew sanctuary, and sacrifices, ceased to be
     valid after the Crucifixion. They had served their purpose in their time
     but were now no longer needed. (This point would become especially
     apparent after the destruction of the temple.)
        With the moral law expressed by the Ten Commandments, how-
     ever, matters are different. In his letters, Paul quotes some of the Ten
     Commandments and alludes to others as universal ethical demands on
     all people, Jewish as well as Gentile. Having written against the prac-
     tice of sin, Paul would not in any way have diminished the very law that
     defines what sin is. That would make about as much sense as telling
     someone not to violate the speed limit while at the same time telling
     them the speed limit signs are no longer valid.
                                                                            99

      The Cross and the Resurrection
       “For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus
      Christ and Him crucified” (1 Cor. 2:2, NKJV).

        No question, the cross of Christ was central to all that Paul lived and
      taught. But Paul didn’t teach the Cross in a vacuum; instead, he taught it
      in the context of other teachings, as well; and one of them, perhaps the
      one most intricately linked to the Cross, was the Resurrection, without
      which the Cross would have been in vain.

Read 1 Corinthians 15:12–22. What do these verses say that show how
      crucial the death and resurrection of Jesus are to the gospel? Why
      is a proper understanding of death as a sleep crucial for making
      sense of these texts? That is, if the dead in Christ are already in
      heaven, what is Paul talking about here?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         Unfortunately, the majority of Christian traditions, as well as non-
      Christian religions, believe strongly in the immortality of the human
      soul. Against this belief, however, Paul emphasized repeatedly that:
         1. Only God has immortality (1 Tim. 6:16);
         2. Immortality is a gift from God to the saved (1 Thess. 4:16);
         3. Death is a sleep until Christ returns (1 Thess. 4:13–15; 1 Cor. 15:6,
      18, 20).
         Worship in almost all religions includes numerous false teachings
      based on the false concept of the immortality of the soul. These errors
      include things such as reincarnation, praying to saints, veneration of
      ancestral spirits, an eternally burning hell, and many New Age prac-
      tices, such as channeling or astral projection. A true understanding
      of the Bible’s teaching on death is the only real protection against
      these great deceptions. How unfortunate, too, that those who show the
      strongest inclination against accepting this truth are Christians of other
      denominations.
       A believer closes his or her eyes in death and, after what seems
       like a moment of darkness and silence, he or she is awakened to
       eternal life at the Second Coming. What does the truth about the
       state of the dead reveal to us about God’s character?

     Getting Along
       Paul was a hard worker with a strong personality and singleness
     of purpose. Such persons can be loners with few friends but many
     admirers. However, on his travels, two or three fellow workers often
     accompanied Paul. At least eight of these close fellow workers are
     mentioned by name (Acts 13:2; 15:22, 37; 16:1–3; 19:22; Col. 4:7, 10,
     11; Philem. 24). To this must be added Paul’s greetings to 24 people in
     Romans 16, in addition to general greetings to households.
       The apostle believed in teamwork, especially in pioneering situations. At
     the same time, however, he did at times have conflict with fellow laborers.

Read Acts 15:38–41. What happened here, and what does it tell us
     about the humanity of even these great workers for the Lord?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        “It was here that Mark, overwhelmed with fear and discouragement,
     wavered for a time in his purpose to give himself wholeheartedly to the
     Lord’s work. Unused to hardships, he was disheartened by the perils
     and privations of the way. . . . This desertion caused Paul to judge Mark
     unfavorably, and even severely, for a time. Barnabas, on the other hand,
     was inclined to excuse him because of his inexperience. He felt anxious
     that Mark should not abandon the ministry, for he saw in him qualifica-
     tions that would fit him to be a useful worker for Christ.”—Ellen G.
     White, The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 169, 170.
        The account in Acts reveals that Paul expected his companions to
     persevere in the toils and perils of their mission. For Paul, the close team
     constituted a church in miniature. He stressed the importance of setting
     a good example, the imitation model of mission. Dutiful yet loving rela-
     tionships among team members became a pattern for the churches, which
     were often based on households. The team also provided an ideal setting
     for the training of new evangelists and missionaries. Of course, at times
     things didn’t always run smoothly, as in the case of John Mark.

Read 2 Timothy 4:11. What does this text reveal about growth and
     forgiveness?
     _________________________________________________________
      We all make mistakes. How can you learn to forgive those whose
      mistakes have hurt you? And think also about those whom you’ve

Further Study: The apostle Paul has been compared with the butterfly
      effect in chaos theory: that “the flap of a butterfly’s wings in California
      causes a hurricane in Asia.” His work as a writer and preacher helped
      turn a Jewish sect in an obscure corner of the Roman Empire into
      a world religion. The ideas put forth in his 13 letters have probably
      exerted greater influence than any other ancient Greek literature of
      comparable size.

Discussion Questions:
        Paul avoided martyrdom by fleeing to Athens, the intellectual
       center of the Greco-Roman world. Cities provide shelter for refu-
       gees, including Christians. The apostle lost no time; after observ-
       ing the city’s religious monuments, he reasoned with the Jews and
       preached in the marketplace. Read Acts 17:16–31. What approach
       does Paul take with these people, and how does it help us to under-
       stand the need to tailor the message for various people groups? At
       the same time, look at how Paul did not in any way water down or
       compromise truth in order to reach these people. In our attempts
       to reach others, how can we be certain that we don’t compromise
       core beliefs?

        Why is the state of the dead such an important teaching? What
       are some of the many errors and deceptions that an understanding
       of this truth protects us against? What about your own culture?
       What are some of the beliefs against which this truth can be a
       bulwark?

        Dwell more on the question of the role of signs in regard to
       faith and the role of logic and reason, as well. In class, let those
       who are willing talk about how they came to faith and what role
       such factors as signs or logic, and so on, had in their experiences.
       Also, what role should they have, not just in coming to faith but in
       maintaining faith?

        What about the majority of people in your society? What kind
       of background do they have? What kind of beliefs are the most
       common? Based on your understanding of their beliefs and back-
       ground, think through carefully the best approach to reach out to
       them. What are some entering wedges that will allow you to make
       contact in a way that will not immediately offend them?

The Stolen Sermons: Part 2
  by Gamini Mendis

   I remained in the hospital for two weeks in great pain but slowly began
to recover. Many pastors came to visit me. Some said that God struck me
down because I had visited the Seventh-day Adventist church. The Adventist
pastor visited me several times and brought me a book entitled The Great
Controversy. I had lots of time to read, and by the time I was discharged, I
had finished the book. When the Adventist pastor came to visit me at home,
I had many questions.
   When I had recovered enough to preach at my church again, I went
back to visiting the Seventh-day Adventist church to borrow the pastor’s
sermon notes. Of course, I didn’t tell him what I was doing, nor did I tell
my own congregation where I was getting my sermon material.
   One Sabbath the Adventist pastor preached a sermon on the Sabbath.
I borrowed that sermon too. After I preached, members of my church
asked me why we worship on Sunday if Saturday is God’s holy Sabbath.
   Suddenly, I realized that I was trapped by my own cunning. I needed
more information so I could answer my congregation’s questions. I
visited the Adventist pastor and asked him to study the Bible with me,
beginning with the Sabbath. After we studied, I asked him all the ques-
tions I thought my congregation would ask. Then I called my church
members together to give them the same Bible study on the Sabbath.
Not all were interested in this new truth, but many wanted to learn more.
   Word reached the church leaders in my denomination that I was
teaching Seventh-day Adventist doctrines. They told me that if I
insisted on preaching like an Adventist pastor I couldn’t continue as
pastor in my church. By this time I believed in the Sabbath and other
Bible truths I had learned through borrowing the pastor’s sermons.
   I decided to become a Seventh-day Adventist, turn my church into a
Seventh-day Adventist church, and bring as many members of my con-
gregation with me as would listen. Sundays became Bible study days
in my church, and several Adventist pastors came to help me teach the
people. For three or four months, we studied the Bible intensely and
tried to understand God’s will for our lives and our church. Then we
held a baptism in which 20 members of my church joined the Seventh-
day Adventist family. Later 13 more people were baptized. More than
half the members of my little congregation have joined the Seventh-
day Adventist Church.

  Gamini Mendis continues to work as a pastor in the same area of Sri
Lanka where he once pastored a charismatic church. He now has three
Seventh-day Adventist churches.

       Must the Whole World
       Hear?


       S abbath A fternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Acts 4:12, Ps. 87:4–6, John 10:16,
       Rom. 2:12–16, John 14:6, Rom. 1:18.

Memory Text: “Now to him who is able to establish you in accor-
       dance with my gospel, the message I proclaim about Jesus Christ, in
       keeping with the revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages past,
       but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by
       the command of the eternal God, so that all the Gentiles might come
       to the obedience that comes from faith—to the only wise God be
       glory forever through Jesus Christ! Amen” (Romans 16:25–27, NIV).



       A
               s we have seen, the Lord uses people to bring the message of
               the gospel to others. However, throughout the ages, millions
               have died without knowing the biblical plan of salvation. The
      fact is that a majority of those who have ever lived have not heard the
      story of redemption or known about the good news of God’s grace as
      revealed in Jesus Christ. This leads to two persistent questions. First, on
      the day of judgment, how is God going to deal with these billions who
      have not known Him? Second, is there salvation outside of someone’s
      knowing the plan of salvation as it is in Jesus?
         Some would answer that there is salvation in a single Christian
      denomination only; in contrast, others believe that all religions are
      equally valid guides to God and eternal life.
         In the end, the crucial point to remember is that Jesus has revealed to us
      the character of God, and this tells us a lot about His love for all humanity
      and His desire for as many as possible to be saved. God is a God of justice,
      and however He works it out, the shout will be heard across heaven: “ ‘Just
      and true are Your ways, O King of the saints!’ ” (Rev. 15:3, NKJV).

      No Other Name Under Heaven
        Some Christians have the conviction that only those who hear and
      respond positively to the Christian gospel can be saved. The people,
      sometimes called “exclusivists,” regard all non-Christian religions as
      constructs of fallen humans, which express willful rebellion against
      God. Non-Christians are, they believe for that reason, outside the sav-
      ing grace of Jesus Christ.
        Some Christians take the further step of claiming that outside their
      specific denomination and doctrinal structure there is no salvation,
      even for other confessing Christians. For them, other denominations
      with their divergent beliefs have placed themselves outside the care
      of God and have no chance of entering the kingdom of heaven. For
      instance, in 1302 in his papal bull Unam Sanctam, Pope Boniface VIII
      declared “that it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human
      creature be subject to the Roman Pontiff.” Some Protestants have taught
      something similar in regard to their own denominations, as well.

Read Acts 4:12. What is it saying, and how are we to understand these
      words?

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        The words of the Scripture here are very clear: salvation is found
      only in Jesus Christ and in no other name under heaven. It’s important,
      however, not to read into these words more than they specifically say.
        Imagine a man in a building that is on fire; before being able to
      escape, he is overcome by smoke and collapses unconscious. A fire-
      fighter finds him on the floor, grabs him, and brings him outside, where
      the medics take over. He is rushed to the hospital, and a few hours later
      he regains consciousness.
        The point is that this person, who was saved, had no idea who had
      saved him. In the same way, anyone who is saved—either before Jesus
      came in the flesh or after—will be saved only through Jesus, whether
      or not that person had heard of His name or of the plan of salvation.
        “Among the heathen are those who worship God ignorantly, those to
      whom the light is never brought by human instrumentality, yet they will
      not perish. Though ignorant of the written law of God, they have heard
      His voice speaking to them in nature, and have done the things that the
      law required. Their works are evidence that the Holy Spirit has touched
      their hearts, and they are recognized as the children of God.”—Ellen G.
      White, The Desire of Ages, p. 638.

                                                                          105

      How Much Must One Know?
        Picking up where we left off on Sunday, we can see that although the
      work of Christ provides the only means of salvation, some believe that
      explicit knowledge of Christ is not necessary in order for one to be saved.
        This does not imply that salvation is available apart from Christ but
      that God is able and willing to apply the merits of Christ’s work to
      whomever He wishes. Some believe that those who do not know Christ
      and have never been exposed to the gospel, but who under the influ-
      ence of the Holy Spirit feel a need for deliverance, and act on it, will
      be saved. The quote from Ellen G. White at the end of yesterday’s study
      certainly implies this (think of Job and Melchizedek).

What light do the following texts shed on this idea?
      Ps. 87:4–6________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      John 10:16________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      Acts 14:17________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      Acts 17:26–28_____________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      Rom. 2:12–16_____________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         “God ‘will repay each person according to what they have done.’ To
      those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immor-
      tality, he will give eternal life” (Rom. 2:6, 7, NIV).
         Paul here declares that there are some outside of Christianity who will
      receive eternal life as a result of an “obedience-unto-life” principle (cf.
      Lev. 18:5). For those “Gentiles” who “show that the requirements of the
      law are written on their hearts” because “their consciences also bearing
      witness” (Rom. 2:15, NIV), it will make a difference on Judgment Day
      because these people have responded to the work of the Spirit in their
      hearts.

       Because we don’t know people’s hearts, why in all cases, either
       with professed Christians or non-Christians, must we be careful
       not to judge their souls’ salvation?

     Universalism and Pluralism
        Some people teach that in the end God is going to save all human
     beings, regardless of what they believed or even how they lived.
     “Universalism” is the conviction that all persons are so related to God
     that they will be saved, even if they never heard or believed the gos-
     pel. After all, John 3:16 says, “God so loved the world.” Thus, in this
     thinking, if He loves everyone, how can anyone be lost, especially if
     being lost means eternal torment in hell? How could God burn forever
     someone whom He loves? Hence, we can see how one false doctrine
     (eternal torment) leads to another (universalism).
        Related to universalism is “pluralism,” the conviction that all reli-
     gions are equally valid and lead equally to God and salvation. No reli-
     gion is inherently better than, or superior to, any other religion, at least
     according to this theology. A pastor in a church in California wrote
     on the church Web site that his congregation “does not believe that
     Christianity is superior in any way to other religious beliefs.”
        For pluralists, the vast range of religious rituals and beliefs, symbols
     and metaphors, are mere surface differences concealing a similar core
     of all religions. Pluralists point out, for example, that most religions
     emphasize love for God and love for fellow human beings, a form of
     the golden rule, and hope for a blessed future life. According to them,
     all faiths, at the core, teach the same thing; hence, they are all valid
     paths to God, and it is very chauvinistic and arrogant to try to push
     Christian beliefs upon those who are members of non-Christian faiths.

What does the Bible have to say about both universalism and plural-
     ism? John 14:6; Rev. 20:14, 15; 21:8; Dan. 12:2; John 3:18; Matt.
     7:13, 14; 2 Thess. 2:9, 10.

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       No question, both universalism and pluralism are contrary to
     Scripture. Not everyone will be saved; and all faiths do not lead to
     salvation.

      What answer would you give to someone who argues that
      Christianity’s claim to be the only true path to salvation (see John
      14:6) is arrogant and exclusivist? Share your answer with your
      class on Sabbath.

      Sinners in Need of Grace
         “For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the
      world, but to save the world through him” (John 3:17, NIV). What
      great hope is found in this verse for all humanity? How can we take
      this crucial truth and, first, make it our own? How then can we use
      it to motivate us to reach out to others?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        According to the Bible, we are all sinners (Rom. 3:23), and God
      wishes for all to repent (Acts 17:30, 26:20, 2 Pet. 3:9) and be saved
      (1 Tim. 2:4). From the Fall in Eden onward, God’s purpose has been to
      save humanity from the devastation and ultimate eternal death that sin
      and rebellion have brought to humanity. What more proof do we need
      than the Cross to show God’s love for us and His desire to save us?
        However, Scripture is clear that God will not save those who openly
      rebel against Him.

Read Genesis 6:11–13, Romans 1:18, 2 Thessalonians 2:12, Revelation
      21:8, 22:15. What powerful warning is found in these verses?

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         God loves all people, but all people are sinners in need of grace,
      and this grace has been revealed in Jesus. He has called His church to
      spread the good news of this grace to the world.
         “The church is God’s appointed agency for the salvation of men.
      It was organized for service, and its mission is to carry the gospel to
      the world. From the beginning it has been God’s plan that through His
      church shall be reflected to the world His fullness and His sufficiency.
      The members of the church, those whom He has called out of darkness
      into His marvelous light, are to show forth His glory. The church is the
      repository of the riches of the grace of Christ; and through the church
      will eventually be made manifest, even to ‘the principalities and pow-
      ers in heavenly places,’ the final and full display of the love of God.
      Ephesians 3:10.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 9.

       In what ways can you personally (not the pastor, not the elder, not
       the deacon, but you) better learn to “show forth His glory” to a dying
       world? What must you change in your life in order to do this?

The Mission Call
  “I have become all things to all people so that by all possible
means I might save some. I do all this for the sake of the gospel, that
I may share in its blessings” (1 Cor. 9:22, 23, NIV). What important
principle is Paul espousing here, and how can we reflect this same
attitude in our own lives?

_________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________

   The Lord of missions, in His wisdom, chose to work through humans
to bring the message of forgiveness and salvation to the world. God
chose men and women, despite their weaknesses, to work together with
the Holy Spirit and the angels. Israel was to be God’s steady “light” in
Old Testament times, but too often they put their light “under a basket”
(Matt. 5:15, NKJV). Too many times the blessings they received were
kept inside Israel. Instead of mixing and sharing, they shut themselves
away from the nations in order to escape “contamination.”
   God’s next plan for world mission called for the salt method—to
go “and make disciples” (Matt. 28:19, NKJV; Mark 16:15, 20; Acts
1:8). The history of Christian missions sparkles with stories of self-­
sacrificing missionaries who went as salt to the world, bringing the gos-
pel of life to individuals, communities, and sometimes entire nations.
   However, as with ancient Israel, too often these mission successes
have been obscured by the human shortcomings of the missionaries
themselves and their overall mission enterprise. These human short-
comings include (1) poor planning for outreach, inadequate under-
standing of the task; (2) narrow focus on mission only as education,
health care, disaster relief, or development, which overshadow preach-
ing the gospel; (3) underfunding and understaffing by the sending
organizations; (4) missionaries unsuited to the task; and (5) nations that
forbid the preaching of the gospel.
   Of course, no one ever said that it was going to be easy. We are in
the midst of a great controversy, and the enemy will work every way he
can to thwart our outreach efforts, whether in our own neighborhoods
or in the most “remote” corners of the world. We, though, mustn’t be
discouraged, because we have been given many wonderful promises of
power, and we can be sure that God will fulfill His purposes on earth.
As we have been told: “ ‘So shall My word be that goes forth from
My mouth; it shall not return to Me void, but it shall accomplish what
I please, and it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it’ ” (Isa.
55:11, NKJV).

                                                                    109

Further Study: Ellen G. White, “On the Mount of Olives,” in The Desire
      of Ages, p. 633; “Speedy Preparation,” in Fundamentals of Christian
      Education, p. 335; “Extension of the Work in Foreign Fields,” in
      Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 23.

         The New Testament employs two Greek nouns, accompanied by the
      adjective “all,” to express the worldwide extent of Christian mission:
      “all the kosmos” in Matthew 26:13, Mark 14:9, and 16:15, and “all the
      oikoumene” - in Matthew 24:14. While kosmos, the more general term
      for the realm of orderly existence, signifies the planet (with approxi-
      mately one hundred fifty New Testament occurrences), the more spe-
      cific oikoumene- focuses on the world’s human inhabitants.
         How extensive was “the whole world” for the first Christians?
      Within a few years of the Crucifixion, they had reached modern-day
      Cyprus, Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, Macedonia, Greece, and Italy. There
      is evidence that they propagated the gospel as far as southern Russia
      (ancient Scythia) in the north, Ethiopia in the south, India in the east,
      and Spain in the west.
         Did the early Christian missionaries believe they had to reach the
      whole world with the gospel? According to Acts of the Apostles, the
      Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost, the “birthday” of the Christian
      church, began to proclaim the “mighty works of God” to visitors from
      a list of nations, geographic regions, and ethnic groups (Acts 2:5–11).
      From its first day of life, the Christian church has been aware of the
      worldwide extent of its mission. If they had that understanding back
      then, how much more so should we today?

Discussion Questions:
        In class, go over your answer to the final question on Tuesday’s
       study about Christian claims being exclusivist and arrogant. Does
       exclusivism necessarily translate into arrogance? If not, why not?
        The church’s understanding of the size and extent of “the
       whole world” has expanded since the Day of Pentecost. Jesus’
       gospel commission to “ ‘go therefore and make disciples of all the
       nations’ ” (Matt. 28:19, NKJV) will remain present truth for the
       church until Christ returns. How does the proclamation of the
       three angels’ messages of Revelation 14:6–12 fit in with the Great
       Commission?
        How would you answer this question: If people can be saved
       without ever having heard the gospel, what’s the point of risking
       life and limb in order to spread it to them?

Providential Bus Encounter
  by Kusumawathie Perera

   One morning I was riding a bus to Colombo, the capital city of Sri
Lanka. I saw Francis, a longtime family friend, sitting nearby. I hadn’t
seen him in a long time and was surprised to learn that he had become a
Seventh-day Adventist. I, too, had become a Christian two years earlier.
   “I was paralyzed and unable to do anything,” I told Francis. “Then some
Christians prayed for me, and God healed me. I attended their church, but
some things they do in their worship service make me uncomfortable—
jumping around, shouting, and rolling on the floor, and talking in strange
languages. Lately, I haven’t gone to church.”
   Francis offered to bring a friend to visit me. “We can study the Bible
together. I’ll tell you a little about the Seventh-day Adventists and what
we believe,” he offered.
   A few weeks later, Francis came with his pastor. We had a pleasant
visit, and the pastor talked about God and Jesus in such simple and easy-
to-understand language that I felt very close to Him. Then he prayed for
my family and me. His prayer was like a beautiful conversation with a
friend.
   Francis and the pastor visited me often and shared God’s truths with
me. I enjoyed the Bible studies, but my husband wanted nothing to do
with God.
   One day, my husband came home drunk when the pastor and Francis
were still there. My husband often got drunk, sometimes becoming vio-
lent, breaking up the furniture and terrifying the children and me.
   When the pastor saw my husband’s condition, he prayed for him. I
knew that my husband would never remember even seeing the pastor,
but I was glad that the pastor was willing to pray for him.
   The next morning, my husband was sober. He remembered almost
nothing of the previous day’s drinking binge, but he remembered that
the pastor had prayed for him. In some mysterious way that prayer had
touched him, and he said he was healed from drinking. I wanted to
believe him, but he had promised to stop drinking before, and it never
lasted. But from that day on, my husband never touched alcohol again.
   When the pastor and Francis visited again, I told them what had hap-
pened to my husband, and we rejoiced together. When I completed Bible
studies, I was baptized and became a Seventh-day Adventist. Although
my husband has not yet given his life to God, I know he believes, and
one day he will come to the Savior.

2015
          Jeremiah, the topic for next quarter, written by Imre Tokics, reveals the
       reality of God’s desire for humans to obey Him and the human tendency
       not 10. The book recounts Jeremiah’s ministry as he preached God’s mes-
       sage to a people who, for the most part, didn’t want to hear it.
          The book takes us through decades of biblical history as the Lord used
       Jeremiah to proclaim truths that have been the foundation of the biblical
       message from the beginning. Of all the spiritual truths taught in the book,
       these words catch the essence of so much of what the Lord seeks from
       His people: “Thus says the Lord: ‘Let not the wise man boast in his wis-
       dom, let not the mighty man boast in his might, let not the rich man boast
       in his riches, but let him who boasts boast in this, that he understands
       and knows me, that I am the Lord, who practices steadfast love, justice,
       and righteousness in the earth. For in these things I delight, declares the
       Lord’ ” (Jer. 9:23, 24). Jeremiah takes a spiritual journey from the lowest
       depths of human depravity to heights and grandeur and majesty of the
       Lord, who, from those heights, cries out to all of us in our fallen state.

       Sabbath Gem: Despite opposition, Jeremiah could not be sold or
       bought; he stood as “a fortified city, an iron pillar and a bronze wall”
       (Jer. 1:18), not in his own strength but in the Lord’s.

Lesson 2—The Crisis (Within and Without)
       The Week at a Glance:
       Sunday: A Quick History (Judg. 2:1–15)

       Sabbath Gem: God’s people faced challenges, but their great-
       est crisis came from within in the sense that the people’s hearts
       had become so hardened and damaged by sin and apostasy that
       they refused to heed the warnings that God was sending to them.
