                  hile many books of the Bible are filled with deep spiritual and
                  theological truths, the book of Proverbs is filled with practical and
                  down-to-earth advice for daily living.
       Brief, well-balanced, poetic, salty, and often humorous, the proverbs are uni-

       For instance, “Go to the ant, you sluggard! Consider her ways and be wise”
    (Prov. 6:6, NKJV). Or: “It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a conten-

    food to eat; if he is thirsty, give him water to drink. In doing this, you will heap
    burning coals on his head, and the Lord will reward you” (Prov. 25:21, 22, NIV).
    Who is going to forget those types of images?
       The book of Proverbs is a witness to the wisdom that had been accumulated over
    generations. Its human authors are referred to as King Solomon (Prov. 1:1–9:18,
    10:1–22:16, Proverbs 25–29); as nonidentified “wise men” from the ancient Near
    Eastern world (Prov. 22:17–24:22, 24:23–34); and as the non-Israelite Agur (Prov.
    30:1–33). The book even acknowledges King Hezekiah’s editorial contributions
    (Prov. 25:1). In some cases, too, the book reflects ancient Near Eastern texts, espe-
    cially those from ancient Egypt.
       Yet the book of Proverbs is the Word of God, because it was under divine


2
inspiration that the authors pulled their materials together. Although God is rarely
explicitly mentioned in the texts, He is always present: wherever we are in the market-
place, or as we speak, eat, drink, work, buy, sell, socialize, and love, the Lord is there.
The God of Proverbs is not just the God of a religious person, whether a priest or a
worshiper in the pew. Godliness is here put into working clothes.
    The book of Proverbs also teaches about what it
means to fear God (Prov. 1:7, 31:30), not just in church
but as we go about our daily lives, because the way we           The book of Proverbs is

is, wisdom is living in faith and in obedience; it’s about
what it means to be human before the God of Creation.
    From the book of Proverbs we will learn how to be wise, but concretely, in practical
ways. The book answers such questions as What and how should I teach my children?
How can I be happy and successful? Why do I have money problems? How can I get a
promotion in my job? How can I resist sexual temptations? How should I cope with my
anger or my tongue?
    Finally, wisdom isn’t necessarily intellectual might. On the contrary, the one who is
sure of his or her brainpower is in the most danger of playing the fool, because even the
smartest person knows so little. One may think of oneself as already wise and therefore
as having no need to seek more knowledge. The prerequisite for wisdom is, instead, to
be humble, to feel our need and then to ask for wisdom.
    Proverbs is deep and rich, and it deals with many topics. Given the limitations of
space, we’ve had to pick and choose which material we could cover. We can’t cover it
all, but all that we have is, indeed, worthy of our prayerful study.

      The Call of                    Wisdom



      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Proverbs 1–3, Gen. 1:1, Exod.
      19:16, 20:20, Prov. 11:30, 13:12, 15:4.

Memory Text: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge,
      but fools despise wisdom and instruction” (Proverbs 1:7, NKJV).



      F
            rom Eden onward, the root of human tragedy lies in wrong
            choices. “Man lost all because he chose to listen to the deceiver
            rather than to Him who is Truth, who alone has understanding.
      By the mingling of evil with good, his mind had become confused.”
      —Ellen G. White, Education, p. 25.
         The book of Proverbs is all about helping us to make right choices,
      to choose the way of God and not that of the deceiver. The father or
      the mother, speaking to their son, not only warns him against wrong
      choices but also encourages him to make the right ones. This is so
      important because the choices we make are literally matters of life and
      death.
         The first three chapters of Proverbs illustrate this method of educa-
      tion. After having explained the purpose of the book: “to know wis-
      dom” (Prov. 1:2), and having laid down the motto of the book: “the fear
      of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge” (Prov. 1:7; compare 9:10),
      the author moves back and forth from warning us against listening to
      foolishness, to urging us to respond to the call of heavenly wisdom.

     The Beginning of Wisdom
       In Proverbs 1:1–6, the title “the proverbs of Solomon the son of
     David” (Prov. 1:1) establishes a link between this proverb and 1 Kings
     3:5–14. In Kings (as in the book of Proverbs), Solomon is presented
     as a son seeking wisdom from God. In addition to both referring to
     Solomon as “the son of David,” the two texts share significant com-
     mon wording: “understand,” “wisdom,” “judgment.” Not only do these
     parallels confirm Solomon as the one behind the composition of the
     book, they also show that Proverbs is dealing with the human quest for
     wisdom from God.

Read Proverbs 1:7. What is wisdom? What is “the fear of the Lord”?
     How do these two concepts relate to each other?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        “Wisdom” here is defined as a religious experience. It is related to
     the fear of the Lord. This important concept of the Hebrew religion is
     key to Proverbs. Not only does it occur repeatedly, but it also frames
     the entire book (Prov. 1:7, 31:30).
        The fear of the Lord has nothing to do with the superstitious and
     childish fear of divine punishment. Instead, it should be understood
     as the acute consciousness of God’s personal presence at all times
     and everywhere. The fear of the Lord had characterized the people’s
     reaction to God’s revelation at Sinai (Exod. 19:16, 20:20), just as it
     explained their commitment to be faithful and to love God in response
     to His covenant with them (Deut. 10:12).
        In short, to fear God means to be faithful to God and to love Him.
        The phrase “the fear of the Lord is the beginning of . . . wisdom”
     means that wisdom originates in this “fear.” The Hebrew word for
     “beginning” (reshit) points to the first word introducing the Creation
     story (Gen. 1:1). The first lesson of wisdom, then, deals with under-
     standing that God is our Creator, the One who gives us life and breath,
     and that He is always present—a God of love, and justice, and redemp-
     tion (John 3:16, Ps. 89:14, Heb. 9:12).

      We are told to love God and also to fear Him. How do these two
      concepts relate to your own experience with the Lord?




                                                                          7

     True Education
Read Proverbs 1:8–19. What two contrasting ways of “education” are
     presented in these verses? What’s the basic message here, not just
     for parents, but for everyone who fears the Lord?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Education is, first of all, a family matter, and true education comes,
     first and foremost, from the parents. In these verses, this education is
     called “instruction” and even “law.” The Hebrew word for law, torah,
     means “direction.” The parents are to point their children in the right
     direction. In contrast, the other type of “education” is not identified, not
     given a name. It is simply acknowledged as the voice of sinners, which
     leads in the wrong direction.
        Also, the words “my son,” not to be taken in a gender exclusive
     sense, are repeated many times, emphasizing parental instruction. Each
     parent—“your father,” “your mother” (NKJV)—is clearly identified
     in the singular and is personally involved, while the other camp is an
     anonymous plural, “sinners.”
        “In His wisdom the Lord has decreed that the family shall be the
     greatest of all educational agencies. It is in the home that the education
     of the child is to begin. Here is his first school. Here, with his parents
     as instructors, he is to learn the lessons that are to guide him throughout
     life. . . . The educational influences of the home are a decided power
     for good or for evil. . . . If the child is not instructed aright here, Satan
     will educate him through agencies of his choosing.”—Ellen G. White,
     The Adventist Home, p. 182.
        The best argument on behalf of family education is its results. These
     are the inner qualities of character, which are like ornaments on the
     head and around the neck. In the Middle Eastern culture, precious col-
     lars and bracelets were passed on from parents to children as a heritage
     of value. Education matters more, though, than material riches. The
     time spent with our children will be of much greater value for them
     than the time spent at our businesses. Also, the reference to the neck
     and the head, which is the individual’s face, suggests that education will
     shape his or her personality. In the way of fools or sinners, only the feet
     (Prov. 1:15) are mentioned, as if the wayward son had lost his identity.

      How can we learn to resist the temptations that culture, society,
      friends, or even family might throw our way?

     The Call of Wisdom
Read Proverbs 1:20, 21. How is wisdom presented here? What are we
     being told?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        While the sinners “lie in wait” and “lurk secretly” (Prov. 1:11, 18,
     NKJV), wisdom “calls aloud outside” (vs. 20, NKJV), “cries out in
     the chief concourses” (vs. 21, NKJV), and “speaks her words” (vs. 21,
     NKJV). Wisdom is here personified, and her offer is given to the man
     and the woman on the street. It is for everyone in the real business of
     life. Amid the noise and rancor of so many products and so many sell-
     ers, the call of wisdom must be loud; otherwise, she would not be heard
     against the clamor of so many other voices.

Read Proverbs 1:22–32. What is the result of rejecting wisdom?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        The reason that people reject wisdom has nothing to do with wisdom
     itself and everything to do with the character of those who reject her.
     These are described as arrogant and disdainful (Prov. 1:25; compare
     vs. 30), as if they know better. The implication is that wisdom is for
     the naive and the simple. And yet those who reject wisdom are simple
     and naive; they are fools who “hate knowledge” (Prov. 1:22, NKJV;
     compare vs. 29).
        Those who reject wisdom will reap the fruit of their rejection. Having
     refused to choose the fear of the Lord, they will have to be content
     with themselves: they will be “full with their own fancies” (Prov. 1:31,
     NKJV). When we reject wisdom from above, we often end up with the
     fables and lies that we fabricate for ourselves, or the fables and lies that
     others fabricate for us and that we so readily accept. In this way, we
     replace God with idols. Ironically, those who despise religion, mocking
     those they judge as simple and naive, often are superstitious in their
     own way, placing value on the most fleeting and useless of things that,
     in the end, can never satisfy the most basic needs of the heart.

      Read Proverbs 1:33. Given the context in what came before,
      what promise and hope are found here for us? How is this promise
      manifested in our own experience?
                                                                               9

     The Benefit of Wisdom
Read Proverbs 2:1–5. What are the conditions for understanding the
     “fear of the Lord”? What choices do we have to make in this matter?

        Three times the discourse is introduced with the conjunction “if,”
     marking three stages in the progression of education. The first “if ”
     introduces the passive stage of listening; that is, simply being recep-
     tive and attentive to the words of wisdom (Prov. 2:1, 2). The second “if ”
     introduces the active response of crying and asking for wisdom (vs. 3). The
     third “if ” introduces passionate involvement in seeking and searching
     for wisdom as we would for “hidden treasures” (vs. 4).

Read Proverbs 2:6–9. What are the conditions for understanding righ-
     teousness? What is God’s responsibility in the acquisition of wisdom?

        Note that the phrase “the Lord gives” in verse 6 (NKJV) responds to the
     phrase “you will . . . find the knowledge of God” in verse 5 (NIV). Wisdom,
     like salvation, is a gift from God. As much as the first paragraph described
     the human process, this paragraph describes the divine work: He gives wis-
     dom; He stores wisdom; and He guards and preserves the way of the wise.

Read Proverbs 2:10–22. What happens when wisdom has finally found
     a home in the heart?

        “When wisdom enters your heart,” it marks the final stage of conver-
     sion. Not only will we enjoy the knowledge of the Lord, but it will be
     a pleasant experience to our souls (Prov. 2:10, NKJV). We will also be
     protected from the way of evil (vs. 12) and from the seduction of evil (vs.
     16), and we will walk in the path of righteousness (vs. 20).

Read Proverbs 2:13, 17. What is the first step of wickedness, and
     where does it lead?

       Though we are sinners, we don’t have to fall into evil. The ones
     depicted as on the wrong path must have first left the right path.
     Wickedness then is understood first of all as a lack of faithfulness. Sin
     begins subtly and innocently, but before long the sinner not only does
     wickedly but also enjoys it.

      What should it tell you about yourself if, heaven forbid, you
      enjoy doing evil? Or even worse, if you don’t even deem it evil
      anymore?

      Do Not Forget!
Read Proverbs 3:7. What is the trap of being wise in one’s own eyes?
      _________________________________________________________

         To be wise in one’s own eyes will lead to the illusion that one does not
      need God to be wise. This is a hopeless situation. “There is more hope
      for a fool than for them” (Prov. 26:12, NIV). Again, wisdom is described
      as a religious commitment. To be wise means to keep God’s command-
      ments (Prov. 3:1), to display “mercy and truth” (vs. 3), and to “trust in
      the Lord” (vs. 5). Wisdom implies an intimate relationship with God.
      Note the repeated reference to the heart (vss. 1, 3, 5), the seat of our
      personal response to God’s influence. (The heart was already mentioned
      in Proverbs 2:10 as the place wisdom should enter.)

Read Proverbs 3:13–18. What reward comes with the gift of wisdom?
      _________________________________________________________
      _________________________________________________________

         Wisdom is associated with life and health (Prov. 3:2, 8, 16, 18, 22).
      One of the most suggestive images is the “tree of life” (vs. 18), a prom-
      ise repeated several times in the book (Prov. 11:30, 13:12, 15:4). This
      metaphor alludes to the Garden of Eden. This promise does not mean
      that the acquisition of wisdom will provide eternal life; instead, the idea
      is that the quality of life with God, which our first parents enjoyed in
      Eden, can to some measure be recovered. When we live with God, we
      get some inkling, some hints, of Eden; even better, we learn to hope in
      the promised recovery of this lost kingdom (see Daniel 7:18).

Read Proverbs 3:19, 20. Why is the need for wisdom so vital?
      _________________________________________________________
      _________________________________________________________

         The sudden reference to the Creation story seems to be out of place
      in this context. Yet the use of wisdom at Creation reinforces the argu-
      ment of verse 18, which associates wisdom with the tree of life. If
      God used wisdom to create the heavens and the earth, wisdom is not a
      trivial matter. The scope of wisdom is cosmic, going beyond the limits
      of our earthly existence. Wisdom concerns our eternal life, as well.
      This lesson is implied in the reference to the tree of life, reminiscent of
      the Garden of Eden. This perspective is also contained in the promise
      that concludes our passage: “The wise shall inherit glory” (Prov. 3:35).

                                                                              11

Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Hidden Treasure,” pp. 111–114,
     in Christ’s Object Lessons; “A Blessing in the Home,” p. 334, in
     Messages to Young People; “Study of Physiology,” pp. 197, 198, in
     Education; Ellen G. White Comments, p. 1156, in The SDA Bible
     Commentary, vol. 3.

        “The youth need to understand the deep truth underlying the Bible
     statement that with God ‘is the fountain of life.’ Psalm 36:9. Not only
     is He the originator of all, but He is the life of everything that lives.
     It is His life that we receive in the sunshine, in the pure, sweet air, in
     the food which builds up our bodies and sustains our strength. It is by
     His life that we exist, hour by hour, moment by moment. Except as
     perverted by sin, all His gifts tend to life, to health and joy.”—Ellen G.
     White, Education, pp. 197, 198.
        “Many cherish the impression that devotion to God is detrimental
     to health and to cheerful happiness in the social relations of life. But
     those who walk in the path of wisdom and holiness find that ‘godliness
     is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and
     of that which is to come.’ They are alive to the enjoyment of life’s real
     pleasures.”—Ellen G. White Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary,
     vol. 3, p. 1156.

Discussion Questions:
       What is the difference between wisdom and knowledge? How
      can someone have a lot of knowledge and not wisdom? After all, who
      doesn’t know personally, or at least know about, some very knowl-
      edgeable people who seem to have no wisdom?

       Dwell more on the idea of “the fear of the Lord.” If “there is no
      fear in love” (1 John 4:18), how can we fear the Lord and still love
      Him? How do we reconcile the tension between justice and love in
      “the fear of the Lord”?

       Why is being “wise in one’s own eyes” such a dangerous state to
      be in, especially when we consider how corrupt the human heart
      is, and how easy it is for us to rationalize just about any behavior
      we want? Think of those who have rationalized the worst of behav-
      iors. How can we make sure we don’t do the same thing?

                                                    Story
From Humptulips to
Aleknagik
   Life was hard in the western Washington town of Humptulips during
the 1930s. Located on the Humptulips River on the Olympic Peninsula,
the town had seen better days for the commercial fishermen trying to earn
a living.
   One family, the Moodys, found life so difficult in Humptulips that they
decided to follow Mrs. Moody’s brother to Alaska, where, according to
the brother, the fishing was good, and there was money to be made. The
family of six packed up and traveled the 2,500 miles from Humptulips
to the Canadian border, then on through British Columbia and the Yukon
before heading west to the frontier town of Dillingham, Alaska. From
Dillingham, they headed up the Wood River, finally arriving on the remote
shores of Lake Aleknagik.
   Although Aleknagik is a Yupik word meaning “wrong way home,” the
Moody family found a good place to settle beside the lake, where they
built a small log cabin. Mr. Moody and the eldest son took their large fish-
ing boat down into Bristol Bay, home of the world’s largest source of red
salmon, while Mrs. Moody cared for the three younger children at home.
   Sadly, just a few months after settling into their new home, tragedy
struck the Moody family. As the father and eldest son headed up the river
from Dillingham, somehow both men ended up in the fast current and
drowned, leaving the mother to raise the two younger sons and a daughter.
   Being a family of faith, the mother continued to gather the children for
worship, and on Sabbath they met with the uncle and his family. During
the week, Mrs. Moody carried out the work of the family fishing business
with the help of her two younger sons, Lloyd, 14, and Roland, 13.
   “We grew up fast,” remembers Roland. “We had a mother and little
sister to help.”
   In order to help their family survive, Lloyd and Roland had little time
for school as they worked as commercial fishermen near their home. By
the time they left their teens, the young men had not yet finished at the
rural public school. Early each morning, Roland, who was now 20, built
a fire in the school’s woodstove so the place would be warm when the
students arrived.
   During those early mornings, Roland not only warmed up the class-
room—he also took the opportunity to get to know the school’s beautiful
young teacher, Miss Jackie. By the end of the year, they were married and
set up a home beside Lake Aleknagik.

      From Ears to                         Feet



      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Proverbs 4, 1 Kings 3:9, Matt.
      13:44, Proverbs 5, 1 Cor. 10:13, Prov. 6:1–19.

Memory Text: “Ponder the path of your feet, and let all your ways be
      established. Do not turn to the right or the left; remove your foot
      from evil” (Proverbs 4:26, 27, NKJV).



      S
              cience has demonstrated that hearing impacts how we walk, and
              that even our balance is influenced by how well we hear. So,
              instruction, or education—that is, what we hear—is crucial to
      how we live. “Wisdom is the principal thing,” says Proverbs 4:7.
         Yet no matter how good the instruction is, the student must pay atten-
      tion. Not without some irony an ancient Egyptian teacher noted that
      the “the ear of the boy is on his back; he listens when he is beaten.”
      (In Egyptian art, the student was often represented with big ears on his
      back.)
         It’s not enough just to know about right and wrong; we need to know
      how to choose right and not wrong. Training in wisdom consists in
      hearing proper instruction and in following and obeying what we have
      learned so that we don’t end up walking in the wrong direction.

     Hear!
Read Proverbs 4. What practical truth is found here, and how can we
     apply this to our own lives as we seek to live in faithfulness to God?

       The act of “hearing” marks the first step in education. In Hebrew
     thought the seat of wisdom or of intelligence is located not in the brain,
     but in the ears. This implies that even before we seek to conceptual-
     ize or solve a problem, we first need to hear it. This means we need
     to listen. When Solomon asks for wisdom, he specifically asks for “a
     hearing heart” (1 Kings 3:9, literal translation).
       The first act of wisdom, then, is “to listen,” which suggests that
     wisdom comes from an external source (in this case, the parents). We
     cannot discover wisdom by ourselves. The self-made individual is an
     impossible concept in the domain of biblical wisdom. Wisdom is, first
     of all, something that we receive, not something we shape with our own
     skills or that we unearth through our own brilliance and reasoning. The
     capacity of “paying attention” (Hebrew, “to put one’s heart”) implies
     the involvement of the heart. The search for wisdom, then, is not
     merely a cold, objective enterprise. The heart, which is the core of the
     individual and (in Hebrew thought) the seat of emotions, participates
     in the search for wisdom.

Read Matthew 13:44 and Jeremiah 29:13. What link can you find
     between these verses and the search for wisdom as it is expressed
     in Proverbs 4?

      Emotions play a crucial role in our basic existence as humans,
      and thus cannot and should not be ignored in our relationship
      with God. How do we learn the proper place and value of emo-
      tions in regard to our spiritual life? How have your emotions
      steered you right (and wrong), and what have you learned from
      those experiences?


                                                                            15

     Protect Your Family
       Once we determine to walk in the way of wisdom, we still need great
     caution because we will meet obstacles along that way (see 1 Pet. 5:8).
     One of the greatest dangers we face deals with our families, the most
     precious, sensitive, and intimate domain of life.

Read Proverbs 5. What dangers must we guard against?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       The first danger begins with ourselves; it lies in our own words.
     We should watch our tongues to make sure that what we say does not
     convey an inappropriate or a mixed message. Our lips should be in
     harmony with our knowledge and should reflect our spiritual views.
       The second danger comes from the other woman or the other man
     (although the text refers to the danger coming from a “strange woman,”
     the language should be understood in a generic sense; temptation could
     come from either a man or a woman) who interferes in the family.
     Either could seduce a spouse into violating the marriage vows, and who
     hasn’t seen, or experienced, just how destructive this sin is?
       According to the text, the best way to resist these temptations, which
     often start with alluring words, is to listen to the words of wisdom. By
     heeding and obeying inspired instruction, we are more likely to stay
     focused on the essentials and so be protected from adultery or whatever
     other temptations come our way.
       Of course, not only should we keep ourselves from adultery, we
     should also avoid going to the place where the “temptress” stays (Prov.
     5:10); we certainly should not approach her door (vs. 8).
       Finally, perhaps the best protection of all against the temptation
     to love another woman or man is this: just love your own spouse,
     “the [wife or husband] of your youth” (vs. 18, NKJV). The author of
     Ecclesiastes resonated with this counsel: “Enjoy life with your wife,
     whom you love, all the days of this meaningless life that God has given
     you under the sun” (Eccles. 9:9, NIV). Be thankful for what you have,
     and you won’t be looking elsewhere.

      Read 1 Corinthians 10:13. With this promise before you, what
      definitive and practical steps might you need to take, right now,
      in order to protect yourself from the passions that might be brew-
      ing in you?

     Protect Your Friendship
       Someone once said: “Lord, protect me from my friends; I can take
     care of my enemies.” The book of Proverbs is concerned with the vul-
     nerability of friendship; it counsels us on how to keep our friends and
     also, if necessary, how to protect ourselves from them. The Hebrew
     word for “friend” also means “neighbor,” the one who is close to us, the
     one who is already a friend or who may become one. Biblical wisdom
     values human relationships and appeals for thoughtfulness and respect
     in these relationships.

Read Proverbs 6:1–5. What problem does Solomon refer to, and what
     is the solution? What crucial spiritual principle do we find here as
     well?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       While the torah urges people to help the poor and to lend them
     money without charging interest (Exod. 22:25), wisdom warns us
     against unwise financial backing for a friend who is in debt. The
     duty of charity does not exclude the duty of justice (Exod. 23:2, 3).
     Though we need to be generous when we can, we would be wise to
     make sure that our charity will not turn into a fiasco (compare Prov.
     22:27).
       Hence, the wise counsel given to us in the proverb. The first caution
     applies to our words. How crucial that we evaluate the situation and
     make sure that we can afford to help our friend. If so, only then speak
     and promise. Indeed, the warmth of our relationship or a moment of
     emotion may precipitate our commitment, and we may regret it after-
     ward.
       No matter how well-intentioned you might have been, it’s crucial to
     think before you act and commit to something that you can’t fulfill.
     The point is that if we get into a bind, we need to do what we can to
     fix it, including humbling ourselves, admitting our mistake, and asking
     for grace.

      How do we learn to balance our desire to bear one another’s bur-
      dens (Gal. 6:2) with the words given to us in this proverb?




                                                                          17

     Protect Your Work
Read Proverbs 6:6–8. What can we learn from the ant?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Not only do ants work hard (even harder than humans, if one com-
     pares the burden they are able to carry to the burden humans can carry
     in proportion to their respective weights), but ants work independently
     and do not need to be supervised. The main reason for their hard work
     is the future. They “anticipate” times of trouble (winter) and prepare
     themselves for it. So, the ant teaches us the wisdom of thinking about
     the future when making plans or engaging in an activity. “This is a
     question that demands consideration by every parent, every teacher,
     every student—by every human being, young or old. No scheme of
     business or plan of life can be sound or complete that embraces only the
     brief years of this present life and makes no provision for the unending
     future.”—Ellen G. White, Education, p. 145.

Read Proverbs 6:9–11. What can we learn from the sluggard?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       It is the sluggard who has something to learn from the ant, not the
     other way around: “Go to the ant, you sluggard! Consider her ways and
     be wise” (vs. 6, NKJV). While the ants are at work, the sluggards are
     asleep. While the ants are productive at the harvest, the sluggards keep
     folding their two hands, a symbol of indolence. The ants surpass them-
     selves by carrying burdens heavier than themselves and by preparing
     for the future; the sluggards live in the present and are occupied only
     with themselves.

      Though indolence and laziness are condemned here, we must
      also remember that life consists of more than work and earning
      money. How does the Sabbath, as presented in the context of the
      workweek, help us find this proper balance?

     Protect Yourself
        After having warned us against the particular evils that threaten
     three domains of life—our family, our social contacts, and our work—
     Proverbs gives us a portrayal of the wicked. It is a satire full of irony
     and sharp psychological observation. The two poems (Prov. 6:12–15
     and 16–19) are parallel and, with the same poetic rhythm of seven,
     cover corresponding motifs. The wicked person’s inside is described as
     linked to what is thought in the heart; at the same time, it all becomes
     manifested in what is done on the outside.

Read Proverbs 6:14, 18 and Matthew 15:19. What important point is
     being made here?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        “If you indulge in vain imaginations, permitting your mind to dwell
     upon impure subjects, you are, in a degree, as guilty before God as
     if your thoughts were carried into action.”—Ellen G. White, The
     Adventist Home, p. 334.

What warnings are given in Proverbs 6:12–19?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        The imagery is ironic. The walking wicked follows the lazy sluggard.
     The two attitudes seem to be different, and yet they carry the same
     lesson. Both stay within themselves. Neither one is interested in the
     instruction coming from outside of themselves. They both follow their
     own wisdom and inclinations. The sluggards are sleeping, and neither
     their ears nor their feet function; the wicked have only their feet and
     their mouths working, not their ears. The result is the same: they will
     both go to destruction.
        Meanwhile, evil has two effects: it harms not only persons sinned
     against, but sinners, as well. The liars will finally believe their own lies.
     It is also noteworthy that the ultimate result of wickedness is discord
     and conflict, which also can affect society. Indeed, the effects of sin
     rarely, if ever, remain confined to sinners. Others are impacted, and
     usually only for the worse.

      How have the sins of others affected your life? Greatly, no doubt.
      What lessons can you learn from this about how careful you need
      to be so that your actions don’t hurt others?
                                                                               19

     in The Adventist Home; “In Contact With Others,” pp. 489–491, in The
     Ministry of Healing; “Other Object Lessons,” pp. 117–120, in Education.

        “The student of the Bible should be taught to approach it in the spirit
     of a learner. We are to search its pages, not for proof to sustain our
     opinions, but in order to know what God says. . . .
        “One of the chief causes of mental inefficiency and moral weakness
     is the lack of concentration. . . . With the immense tide of printed mat-
     ter constantly pouring from the press, old and young form the habit
     of reading hastily and superficially, and the mind loses its power of
     connected and vigorous thought.”—Ellen G. White, Education, p. 189.
        “The habitations that the ants build for themselves show skill and
     perseverance. Only one little grain at a time can they handle, but by
     diligence and perseverance they accomplish wonders.
        “Solomon points to the industry of the ant as a reproach to those who
     waste their hours in idleness or in practices that corrupt soul and body.
     The ant prepares for future seasons; but many gifted with reasoning
     powers fail to prepare for the future immortal life.”—Ellen G. White,
     Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, p. 190.

Discussion Questions:
       Dwell more on this idea of how we can help others, even at a
      personal cost to ourselves. How do we look at what this week’s
      lesson taught in contrast to this verse: “Greater love has no one
      than this, than to lay down one’s life for his friends” (John 15:13,
      NKJV)?

       What other lessons can we take from the natural world that
      we can apply to our own lives? Given, however, that the world is
      fallen, why must we be careful in the lessons we do draw?

Camp Polaris: A Guiding Star
   After they married, Roland and Jackie Moody started talking about
ways to reach out to the native Alaskan community around them, and
decided to build a Seventh-day Adventist school on their property by
the lake. They called it the Mission School and offered first through
eighth grade. Students and parents were delighted, and kids came from
as far away as Nome just to attend the mission school. In order to
accommodate the students, two dormitories were built. Additionally,
the Moodys started an Adventist congregation and built the first
Aleknagik Seventh-day Adventist Church.
   As the school grew, Roland and Jackie wanted to provide more for
their students, so they started a camp. “We just didn’t have any place to
take the young kids for activities and stuff,” recalled Roland, “and kids
like to go someplace.” They named the new place Camp Polaris—after
the guiding light of the North Star.
   Roland purchased several old buildings from Crick Cannery, which
had gone out of business. He barged these buildings across Bristol Bay
to Aleknagik, and then 12 miles up the lake to Camp Polaris. More
than 60 years later, these old cannery buildings are still in use each
summer by the children of western Alaska.
   For decades, Roland and Jackie enjoyed hosting the children and
ferrying them up the lake by barge to the camp. Each year on the last
Sabbath of camp, the entire Aleknagik Adventist church prepared a
feast for the kids and made the one-and-a-half-hour boat trip up the
lake to Camp Polaris where they enjoyed a special Sabbath by the lake
with the campers. After Jackie passed away, Roland married Beverly,
who helped continue the Camp Polaris traditions.
   Over the years, the camp has been a vital ministry to the young
people of western Alaska. Many of the children who attend camp come
from less than ideal homes where poverty, alcoholism, and abuse are
too often the norm. They often exclaim that going to the camp is the
highlight of their year, because it is a place where they feel loved,
accepted, and cared for.
   While Roland and Beverly have since retired and moved to Walla
Walla, Washington, the ministry of Camp Polaris continues. You can
become a part of this special ministry to the children of Alaska by
contributing to this quarter’s Thirteenth Sabbath Offering.

      A Matter of Life and
      Death


      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 5:21–30; Prov. 6:21; 7:3;
      Prov. 6:23; 7:2; 6:24; 6:30, 31; Prov. 7:26, 27.

Memory Text: “For the commandment is a lamp, and the law a light;
      reproofs of instruction are the way of life” (Proverbs 6:23, NKJV).



      T
             wo brothers were left home alone, but given a strict warning by
             their mother to not eat the cake that she had just baked. To make
             sure that the boys would obey, she added the threat of punish-
      ment.
         When she left, it took the boys only a few minutes to decide to eat
      the cake anyway. “This is not a matter of life and death,” they reasoned.
      “Our mother would never kill us; so, let’s eat!”
         For the teacher in Proverbs, though, the issue he speaks about is
      indeed a matter of life and death. His language is strong and sometimes
      graphic. Of course, Jesus used very strong language Himself when talk-
      ing about matters of eternal life and death (see Matt. 5:21–30). And no
      wonder. In the end, our ultimate destiny, our eternal destiny (and what
      could be more important than that?), rests upon the choices that we
      make here, now. So we should take the urgency of the strong language
      at face value.

      The Law in Our Lives
Read Proverbs 6:21 and 7:3. How are we to understand the bodily images
      used in these texts regarding how we should relate to God’s law?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         As we saw in an earlier lesson, in Proverbs the heart represents the
      seat of emotions and thoughts. By telling us to bind the law upon our
      hearts (Prov. 6:21), the teacher means that we should always be in close
      connection with the law. There is no moment we may lose contact with
      the law, because the law is what defines sin (Rom. 7:7). The teacher
      also insists that this law should even be written on the tablets of the
      heart (Prov. 7:3), just as the Decalogue was written by God on the stone
      tablets (Exod. 24:12).
         To speak about the law written on the heart means that the law is not
      just an external set of rules imposed on us. The law should penetrate
      our motivations, our secret intentions, and so be part of our intimate
      self. It’s another expression of having the Pauline promise of “Christ in
      you, the hope of glory” (Col. 1:27), be a reality in our lives.
         To tie the law around the neck also means that we should keep it
      close to ourselves. Ancient people used to tie their precious belongings
      around their necks. The neck is the place through which air travels to
      the lungs, allowing breath and life, an association of thoughts that is
      attested in the Hebrew word nephesh (“soul”), which refers to “life”
      and is derived from a word meaning “throat” and “breathing.”
         To bind the law on one’s fingers means to bring the law into the
      domain of actions. The teacher focuses on the fingers to suggest the
      most delicate and intimate actions. The law should affect not only the
      grand choices we make but the smaller ones, as well (see Luke 16:10).
         Although the biblical intention of these images was purely symbolic,
      it is noteworthy that these symbols have been taken literally in Jewish,
      Christian, and Muslim traditions. It is seen through the use of the
      Jewish tefillin around the head and the fingers, the Christian crosses
      around the neck, and the Muslim (and Christian) rosaries around the
      fingers.

       Symbols can be helpful, but why must we be careful not to mis-
       take the symbol for the reality it represents?




                                                                           23

     Light and Life
Read Proverbs 6:23. How is the law related to “light”?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       In the Bible, the word of God or His law has been compared to light:
     “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path” (Ps. 119:105,
     NKJV). In the Hebrew mind, there is a connection between the idea of
     “law” and of “light.” Just as the lamp illuminates the path where we
     walk, the law will help us stay on track; that is, when we face moral
     choices, it will help us to know what the right choice is, even if at times
     reason or personal expedience would tempt us to disregard the law.

What examples can you find in the Bible of those who chose to follow
     God’s law despite powerful reasons not to? What can we learn from
     their obedience? In what cases, if any, did their choice to be faithful
     seem to be the wrong one at least from a human perspective?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________


Along with Proverbs 6:23, read Proverbs 7:2. Why is the law related
     to “life”?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Since the Fall, our hope for eternal life cannot be found in the law,
     but only through faith in Christ. However, obedience to the law and
     the principles it represents continues to play a central part in the life
     of faith (see Matt. 19:17, Rev. 14:12). We obey because, as the Lord
     said to Israel thousands of years ago, “I am the Lord your God” (Lev.
     18:4). The law of God is related to “life,” simply because of who God
     is—the Source of our life. This principle represents true spirituality:
     we trust God and His promises for our present life, just as we trust His
     promises for eternal life.

      Jesus said: “ ‘I am the light of the world. He who follows Me
      shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of life’ ” (John 8:12,
      NKJV). How have you experienced the reality of this wonderful
      promise in your walk with the Lord?

     Fighting Temptation
        As we have just seen, the author of Proverbs 6:23, under the inspira-
     tion of the Holy Spirit, directly links light and life to God’s law. In the
     next verse, he gives a solid example of how the law, as light and life,
     can offer us powerful spiritual protection.

What are we being warned about in Proverbs 6:24? Besides the obvi-
     ous, what more subtle warning is given here?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        When a religious person is tempted, the greatest temptation is to
     find a religious reason to justify the iniquity. Using God to rationalize
     bad behavior is not only a terrible form of blasphemy—it’s powerfully
     deceptive. After all, if someone thinks that “God is with me,” then what
     can you say in reply? This can happen even in cases of adultery. “God
     has shown me that this [man or woman] is the one I should be with.” If
     that’s what they believe, who or what can trump what “God” has shown
     them?
        Notice, too, it’s not just her physical beauty that lures him. She uses
     language, flattering words, to draw the victim into her trap. How often
     have men and women been led into compromising situations by subtle
     and seductive words, sometimes even couched in religious language? The
     author of the book of Proverbs seeks to warn us against this deception.
        The law is the perfect antidote against the “flattering tongue of a
     seductress.” Only the imperative of the law and the duty of obedi-
     ence will help us resist her alluring words, which can sound so true
     and beautiful. Indeed, the seductress will find you not only handsome
     but also wise and bright. She may even evoke her spiritual needs; and
     ironically, dangerously, “the love of God” might become the justifica-
     tion for sin.

      Just think how easily we can be led, even under the guise of faith,
      to justify wrong actions of any kind, not just adultery. Why, then,
      is an absolute commitment to the law of God our only real pro-
      tection against even our own minds and the tricks that they can

     “You Shall Not Steal”
        Right after his warning about adultery (Prov. 6:24–29), the author
     starts talking about another sin: stealing (vss. 30, 31). The relationship
     between the two commandments (stealing and adultery) shows how
     disobedience to one commandment can affect our obedience to the oth-
     ers. The attitude of compromise, to pick and choose in regard to God’s
     law, could be even more dangerous than complete disobedience to the
     law. “The strongest bulwark of vice in our world is not the iniquitous
     life of the abandoned sinner or the degraded outcast; it is that life
     which otherwise appears virtuous, honorable, and noble, but in which
     one sin is fostered, one vice indulged. . . . He who, endowed with high
     conceptions of life and truth and honor, does yet willfully transgress
     one precept of God’s holy law, has perverted his noble gifts into a lure
     to sin.”—Ellen G. White, Education, p. 150.

Read Proverbs 6:30, 31. What are these verses saying about what even
     a desperate person does?

        Poverty and needs do not justify stealing. The thief is guilty even if
     “he is starving” (vs. 30, NKJV). Although the starving thief is not to be
     despised, he must still restore seven times what he has stolen; this shows
     that even the desperateness of his situation does not justify sin. On the
     other hand, the Bible insists that it is our duty to meet the needs of the poor,
     so that they don’t feel compelled to steal in order to survive (Deut. 15:7, 8).
        How interesting that after going from adultery to stealing, the text
     now returns to adultery (Prov. 6:32–35). The two sins are indeed some-
     what similar. In both cases, someone is illicitly taking something that
     belongs to someone else. A crucial difference, however, between steal-
     ing and adultery lies in the fact that the former sin concerns only the
     loss of an object, while the latter deals with something much greater. In
     some cases, one can make restitution for stealing an object; in the cases
     of adultery, especially when children are involved, the damage can be
     much more severe than when stealing is involved.
        “ ‘Thou shalt not commit adultery.’ This commandment forbids not only
     acts of impurity, but sensual thoughts and desires, or any practice that tends
     to excite them. . . . Christ, who taught the far-reaching obligation of the law
     of God, declared the evil thought or look to be as truly sin as is the unlawful
     deed.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 308.

     The Threat of Death
        Most people don’t think of death when they sin; they have other
     things on their minds, usually the immediate gratification and pleasure
     that they derive from their sin. It doesn’t help, either, that popular cul-
     ture often extols adultery and other iniquities. In contrast, the book of
     Proverbs places sin in the right perspective, a view echoed many years
     later by Paul: “The wages of sin is death” (Rom. 6:23).

Read Proverbs 7:22, 23 (NKJV). What makes the adulterer vulnerable to
     the threat of death?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       The one who goes “after her” is described as someone who has lost
     his personality and will. He is no longer thinking. The word immedi-
     ately suggests that he does not give himself time for much reflection.
     He is compared to an ox who “goes to the slaughter,” to a fool who
     goes to “the correction of the stocks,” and to a bird who “hastens to the
     snare.” None of them realize that their life is threatened.

Read Proverbs 7:26, 27. What makes the immoral woman lethal?
     _________________________________________________________

        It’s possible that the woman here depicts more than a “mere” adul-
     terer. In fact, she represents values opposite to wisdom. Solomon uses
     this metaphor to warn his pupil against any form of evil. The risk is
     huge, for this woman does not just wound; she kills, and her power is
     such that she has slain even the strongest of men. In other words, oth-
     ers before you, stronger than you, have not been able to survive in her
     hands. The universal language of this passage clearly suggests that the
     biblical author is speaking about humankind in general. (The Hebrew
     word sheol in the text has nothing to do with “hell,” as commonly
     thought; it designates the place where the dead now are: the grave.)
        In the end, the point is that sin, whether adultery or something else,
     leads to annihilation, the opposite of the eternal life that God wants us
     all to have through Jesus Christ.
        No wonder, as we said in Sabbath’s introduction, the language is
     strong—we are dealing, literally, with matters of life and death.

      Think of some “strong” people who have fallen in a big way. Why
      should this make you tremble for yourself? What is your only
      protection?


                                                                             27

Further Study: “Satan offers to men the kingdoms of the world if they
     will yield to him the supremacy. Many do this and sacrifice heaven. It is
     better to die than to sin; better to want than to defraud; better to hunger
     than to lie.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, p. 495.
        “Choose poverty, reproach, separation from friends, or any suffering
     rather than to defile the soul with sin. Death before dishonor or the
     transgression of God’s law should be the motto of every Christian. As a
     people professing to be reformers, treasuring the most solemn, purify-
     ing truths of God’s word, we must elevate the standard far higher than
     it is at the present time.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church,
     vol. 5, p. 147.

Discussion Questions:
       How can we be serious about the gravity of sin without falling
      into the trap of fanaticism? At the same time, how can we be obe-
      dient to the law of God without falling into legalism?

       Read Exodus 20:1–17. How are all the Ten Commandments
      related to each other? Why, if we openly violate one command-
      ment, are we likely to transgress other commandments, as well?
      (See James 2:11.) What examples can you find in which transgres-
      sion of one commandment has led to the transgression of others?

       Dwell more on the idea of how people might use religion in order
      to justify wrong actions. It’s not that hard to do, especially if you
      tend to hold up “love” as the ultimate standard of right and wrong.
      After all, think about all the bad things done under the pretext of
      “love.” How, then, does the law continue to act as a way of protecting
      people, either from themselves or others, who might otherwise be
      led into sin?

       Look again at the question at the end of Sunday’s study, which
      deals with mistaking symbols for reality. How might we do that?
      For example, how might idolatry be one way of doing this? What
      traditions, which are symbols of spiritual truths, could be mis-
      taken for those truths themselves?

“This Isn’t Yogi Bear!”
   Being from the tropical country of Puerto Rico, Paola never dreamed
that she would end up in the wilds of Alaska. “It’s just so out there,”
Paola says. “It’s one of those places that you’re never going to go to
because it’s so far away.”
   But when the recruiting team from the Alaska Conference came
to Walla Walla University in Washington State, looking for sum-
mer camp staff, Paola decided to check it out. She was hired, and
that summer she found herself lifeguarding on the shores of Lake
Aleknagik at Camp Polaris.
   “It was nothing like I expected,” Paola admits. “I pictured snow and
igloos, but it was gorgeous and green!”
   In addition to the natural beauty, Paola experienced other surprises.
During orientation, the staff were warned that bears frequented the
camp. “We were instructed that these bears aren’t like Yogi Bear [a
friendly children’s cartoon character],” Paola remembers. “But even
though we were warned, a lot of us were still thinking, It’s just a
bear.”
   One day Paola noticed a bear coming into camp. Wanting a pic-
ture, she quickly grabbed her camera and looked down as she walked
toward the lake. Looking up, she suddenly froze—directly in front of
her was a grizzly bear!
   “Everything stopped. I couldn’t hear anything. Everyone else was
in the lodge; no one could see me. The bear was frozen too. The only
thought I had was, This isn’t Yogi!”
   Suddenly, the grizzly headed toward a garbage container, and Paola
moved quickly back into the lodge. “Sometimes you don’t know how
bad something is until you come face-to-face with it,” she says.
   Working at the camp opened her eyes in many ways, Paola admits.
“I realized that I’m not a kid anymore. These are the kids now, and I
needed to take care of them.”
   Sometimes Paola found drawing the line of authority challenging.
“When there were issues, I learned to maneuver around the children,
not making them feel unwelcome or inferior, but working with them
in a way so they could see they needed to stop their tantrums and
come back with the others who were having fun.
   “There had to be a certain amount of respect going on so that they
would know you were the authority but would still feel comfortable
coming to you if they had any problems—especially spiritually. At
Camp Polaris, there is a spiritual aspect to everything.”

      Divine             Wisdom



      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Prov. 8:1–21, Matt. 16:26,
      Prov. 8:22–31, Gen. 1:31, Prov. 8:32–36, 9:1–18.

Memory Text: “The Lord possessed me at the beginning of His way,
      before His works of old” (Proverbs 8:22, NKJV).



      A
               t this stage in Proverbs, wisdom reappears (see Prov. 1:20,
               21), and it’s clear from the texts for this week that wisdom is
               truth—the Truth as it exists in God, the Source and Foundation
      of all truth.
         This accent on the “absolute” character of truth contrasts with some
      contemporary thinking, especially in the West, in which truth is seen
      as relative, contingent, cultural, with one person’s truth being different
      from someone else’s.
         But this concept is not biblical. My truth should be the same as yours,
      simply because “truth” is universal. It does not belong to anyone in
      particular but to all humanity, whether or not all humanity recognizes it.
         Interestingly enough, Pilate’s famous question to Jesus, “What is
      truth?” (John 18:38), came in response to Jesus’ statement, “ ‘Everyone
      who is of the truth hears My voice’ ” (vs. 37, NKJV). Truth, absolute
      truth, exists, and it even speaks to us; what matters for us is whether or
      not we will listen to, and obey, what it is saying.

     Wisdom Cries Out
Read Proverbs 8:1–21 (NKJV). According to these verses, what is the
     value of wisdom?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Wisdom is so important that it must reach everyone. God created all
     human life, and Christ died for each one of us. So wisdom, the knowl-
     edge of God, and the salvation He offers, is for every human being.
        Look at the words used to describe wisdom’s vocal presence: “cry
     out,” “lift up her voice,” “call,” “voice,” “speak,” “opening . . . lips,”
     “mouth,” “lips,” “words.” However one understands these metaphors,
     what is clear is that wisdom is to be communicated; it is to be heard by
     all who will listen. After all, as we saw last week, what wisdom says is
     a matter of life and death.
        Eight times wisdom talks about the truthfulness of her words. The
     description of wisdom here, interestingly enough, parallels the por-
     trayal of the Lord in Deuteronomy 32:4. This parallel, of course, should
     not be surprising, because God, as the Creator of all things (see John
     1:1–3), is the Foundation of all truth.

Read Proverbs 8:10, 11. What do these verses say about wisdom?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       So many people have lived, and still live, in ignorance, in folly, and
     in darkness. Many live with no hope at all or with false hopes. What
     makes this sad state of affairs even sadder is that wisdom and truth are
     so wonderful, filled with hope and promise for a better life now and
     the surety of eternal life in a new heaven and a new earth, all thanks to
     the sacrifice of Jesus. All the wealth in the world means nothing (see
     Eccles. 2:11–13) in contrast to the knowledge of God.

      Read Matthew 16:26 and ask yourself how well your life reflects
      the crucial truth of these words.




                                                                           31

     Wisdom and Creation
Read Proverbs 8:22–31. How is wisdom related to Creation?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        In these texts, wisdom is mysteriously related to the Lord as the
     Creator. This poem shares many common words with the Creation
     account in Genesis 1 and 2, and even reflects its literary structure,
     organized around the three basic elements of heaven, water, and
     earth. The intention of this parallel is to emphasize the primary cre-
     dential of wisdom: if God Himself used wisdom to create, if wisdom
     is the oldest tool, older than the universe itself and fundamental to
     its existence, we should all the more use wisdom in everything we
     do in life.
        There is also a strong emphasis on the divine origin of wisdom.
     The first word of the poem is the Lord, Yahweh, who is said to
     have “begotten” (second word) wisdom. The Hebrew word qanah,
     translated as “possessed” by the NKJV, has the connotation of
     “begetting” rather than “creating” (see Deut. 32:6, Gen. 4:1). The
     next word is the technical word that is associated with the Genesis
     Creation, reshit (“beginning”), which is found in the first verse of
     Genesis: “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.”
        Yet the word beginning in Proverbs 8:22 is used somewhat differ-
     ently from the way it is used in Genesis 1. In Genesis 1:1, the word
     is related to the Creation itself, while in Proverbs 8:22, the word is
     related to God Himself, to His way (derek), which means His nature.
     Thus, wisdom is part of the very nature of God Himself.
        Wisdom, therefore, is situated in time even before the creation of
     the universe. The existence of wisdom, at that time when only God
     was present, traces the antiquity of wisdom “from everlasting.”
        So, wisdom does not originate in us, but rather is revealed to us;
     it is something that we learn, something that is taught to us; it is not
     what we generate out of ourselves. Surely, to walk in our own light is
     to walk in darkness. We are told that Jesus is “the true Light which
     gives light to every man” (John 1:9, NKJV). Every man needs it too.

     Rejoicing in Creation
       In Genesis 1, we see that each step of the Creation concludes with
     the same refrain: “God saw that it was good” (see Gen. 1:4, 10, 12, 18,
     21, 25, 31). The last step (vs. 31) goes even further: “It was very good.”
     The Hebrew word for “good” contains the idea of enjoyment, and it
     also implies relationship. At the end of the whole Creation week, God
     pauses to fully enjoy His creation (Gen. 2:1–3). The time of this pause,
     the Sabbath, is blessed. Likewise, our poem concludes with wisdom’s
     enjoying the Creation.

Read Proverbs 8:30, 31. Why was wisdom rejoicing?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Wisdom’s rejoicing reflects God’s rejoicing at Creation. This rejoic-
     ing not only happens “daily” at each step of Creation but also crowns
     the work of Creation, when the creation (of life on earth) itself was
     completed.
       In Proverbs 8, we find the reason for wisdom’s rejoicing: “My delight
     was with the sons of men” (vs. 31, NKJV). At the end of the Creation
     week, on Sabbath, God entered into a relationship with humans. The
     immediate application of this divine pause and rejoicing, after the work
     of the week, has implications for the human experience of Sabbath:
     “Following the pattern of the Creator, he too may look back upon his
     finished work with joy, pleasure, and satisfaction. In this way man may
     rejoice not only in God’s creation but also in his responsible rulership,
     not exploitation, over creation.”—Gerhard F. Hasel, in Kenneth A.
     Strand, The Sabbath in Scripture and History (Washington, D.C.:
     Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1982), p. 23.

      Read Colossians 1:15–17, 2:3, Revelation 3:14, and John 1:1–14.
      What do these verses tell us about Jesus’ role in the Creation
      itself? Why is His role as Creator so important in understanding
      His role as our Redeemer?




                                                                           33

     Wisdom’s Appeal
       The last few verses of this proverb return to the personal—to the
     practical application of what it means to have wisdom. By contrast,
     the intellectual knowledge about wisdom’s preexistence, about wis-
     dom’s presence at Creation, is certainly deep. But in the Bible, truth
     must always at some point come down to the human level and how we
     respond to what we have been given in Jesus.

Read Proverbs 8:32–36. What life-and-death message is given here?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        The Hebrew word translated as “blessed” (NKJV) means “happy”
     (see RSV). In this passage, the word “blessed” is attached to two propo-
     sitions. The first one describes an action: “Blessed are those who keep
     my ways” (vs. 32, NKJV). The same language is used in Psalm 119:1,
     2, in regard to the law: “Blessed are the undefiled . . . who walk in the
     law of the Lord! Blessed are those who keep His testimonies” (NKJV).
        The second one describes an attitude: “Blessed is the man who
     listens to me” (vs. 34, NKJV). In both cases, the requirement implies
     a continuous effort. It is not enough to have discovered the right
     way; we have to “keep it.” It is not enough to hear the word of God;
     we have to “watch daily” and follow what we know. As Jesus put
     it: “Blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it” (Luke
     11:28, NKJV).
        “Is this the happiness desirable which is to be found in the path
     of disobedience and transgression of physical and moral law? Christ’s
     life points out the true source of happiness and how it is to be attained.
     . . . If they would be happy indeed, they should cheerfully seek to be
     found at the post of duty, doing the work which devolves upon them
     with fidelity, conforming their hearts and lives to the perfect pattern.”
     —Ellen G. White, My Life Today, p. 162.

      Happiness can be an elusive thing; the more we strive for it, the
      harder it seems for us to attain it. Why should faithfulness to
      God, as opposed to the pursuit of happiness, be our first prior-
      ity? Besides, which is more likely to produce happiness (and
      why): seeking it, or seeking first the kingdom of God?

     Either/Or
       Following wisdom’s appeal, the inspired author of Proverbs 9 urges
     his audience to make a choice now between two lifestyles: wisdom or
     folly. The first and last six verses (vss. 1–6, 13–18) are symmetrical and
     bring out the contrast between the opposite camps.

Compare Proverbs 9:1–6 and Proverbs 9:13–18. What is the differ-
     ence between wisdom and folly?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        1. Wisdom is efficient and is involved in Creation: seven verbs are
     used to describe her actions there (vss. 1–3). The seven pillars she has
     hewn (vs. 1) allude to the seven days of Creation. Folly, in contrast, sits
     and does nothing, just pretending to be someone when in fact “she is
     simple, and knows nothing” (vs. 13, NKJV).
        2. Although wisdom and folly call the same audience (note the iden-
     tical vss. 4 and 16), what they provide is essentially different. Wisdom
     invites her guests to eat the bread and drink the drink that she has
     prepared (vs. 5). Folly offers nothing to eat or drink; she simply boasts
     about stolen provisions (vs. 17).
        3. Wisdom calls us to forsake foolishness and, therefore, to live. Folly
     is more tolerant; she does not demand that we forsake anything, but the
     result is death. Those who follow wisdom will be advancing; they will
     “go in the way of understanding” (vs. 6, NKJV). Those who follow folly
     will be static, and they will “not know” (vs. 18, NKJV).

Read Proverbs 9:7–9. How do the wise man and the wicked man
     respond to the instruction of wisdom? What makes the wise man
     wiser than the wicked man?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        The key to wisdom is humility. The wise man is the man who is teach-
     able and responds to instruction with an open mind. Wisdom comes only
     to the one who, like a child, feels the need to grow. This is why, in the most
     explicit manner, Jesus taught that “ ‘unless you . . . become as little children,
     you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven’ ” (Matt. 18:3, NKJV).
                                                                                  35
                  F riday January 23

Further Study: “The Sovereign of the universe was not alone in His
     work of beneficence. He had an associate—a co-worker who could
     appreciate His purposes, and could share His joy in giving happiness
     to created beings. ‘In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was
     with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with
     God.’ John 1:1, 2. Christ, the Word, the only begotten of God, was one
     with the eternal Father—one in nature, in character, in purpose—the only
     being that could enter into all the counsels and purposes of God. . . . And
     the Son of God declares concerning Himself: ‘The Lord possessed me
     in the beginning of His way, before His works of old. I was set up from
     everlasting. . . . When He appointed the foundations of the earth: then I
     was by Him, as one brought up with Him: and I was daily His delight,
     rejoicing always before Him.’ Proverbs 8:22–30.”—Ellen G. White,
     Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 34.

Discussion Questions:
       Why is belief in the Genesis Creation account the foundation
      of biblical wisdom? Why is the idea of evolution contrary to the
      Bible in every way?

       Dwell more on the idea that true wisdom is something that
      we cannot generate of ourselves but that must be revealed to us.
      What are some examples of important truths that we would never
      know other than their being revealed by divine inspiration? For
      instance, how could we know about Christ’s death on the cross and
      what it offers were it not revealed? What about the seventh-day
      Sabbath or the Second Coming?

       How does God’s work, as revealed in Genesis 1, testify to the
      fact that good cannot be mixed with evil? What implications does
      your answer have for the idea that one could, for instance, incorpo-
      rate an evolutionary worldview into the Genesis Creation story?

       How does God’s enjoyment of the creation help us to under-
      stand how we can have a deeper and richer Sabbath experience?

                                                    Story
“Being Ready for Whatever”
  Travis didn’t know what to do with his camper. At the age of 12,
Logan* was the toughest kid in the cabin and wanted to be in charge of
everyone and everything. One night, Logan decided he wasn’t going to
bed, so Travis and his co-counselor came up with a plan.
  “OK,” they told the obstinate camper, “you can stay up—as long as
you read the Bible.” Logan agreed, but he didn’t have a Bible; in fact,
he had never read one. So the co-counselor loaned Logan his Bible,
and by the light of the moon and a flashlight, the boy met the heroes
of Genesis for the very first time.
  The next morning Logan confided to his counselors, “I actually
found some cool stories in there.” He was especially interested in the
story of Joseph and asked many questions, wondering how Joseph was
able to do all that he did.
  “Although Logan still acted tough, you could see the gears starting
to turn as he wondered what we were all about,” remembers Travis.
“It was kind of cool to see the change that took place over the week.”
  Most of the kids who come to Camp Polaris don’t know the Bible’s
stories. Travis remembers a time when only one camper knew the story
of David and Goliath. “We’re ministering to kids who don’t grow up
in Christian homes, who don’t read the Bible. It takes a lot of prayer to
help reach these kids . . . to know how to reach them.”
  Travis, a senior mechanical engineering student at Walla Walla
University, started working at Camp Polaris in 2011. In addition to
being a counselor, he has taught a variety of classes including wake-
boarding and model rocketry.
  “I’ve loved it every summer, that’s why I keep going back,” he says.
“It’s been an absolute blast. On top of that, I’ve learned a lot about
trusting in God, because you get situations where you don’t know how
to make it through the week, but you always do. Then in hindsight, you
see that even the tough things were a positive. It definitely is about
learning to trust God.
  “I think I’m a little more comfortable now with just being thrown
into a situation. I’ve learned to be flexible and go with the flow, and
to be ready for whatever—because you don’t know what’s going to
happen next.”

      The Blessings
      of the Righteous




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Prov. 10:1–14, Matt. 19:19, Prov-
      erbs 11–12, John 3:16, Proverbs 13.

Memory Text: “Blessings are on the head of the righteous, but violence
       covers the mouth of the wicked” (Proverbs 10:6, NKJV).



      A
               s the title suggests, this lesson looks at the blessings of the
               righteous. The Hebrew word zaddiq, for “righteous,” is the
               key word in our texts. Zedeq (also translated “justice”), from
      which it is derived, appears in the introduction of the whole book:
      “The proverbs of Solomon . . . to receive the instruction of wisdom,
      justice [zedeq] . . .” (Prov. 1:1–3). What the book of Proverbs is telling
      us is that wisdom is righteousness, and “righteousness” means to walk
      according to God’s commands—to walk in faith and obedience to what
      the Lord has called us to be and to do. Righteousness is a gift, one that
      comes from God. The opposite is folly and unfaithfulness. Wisdom is
      justice, or righteousness; folly is sin and wickedness—and in the verses
      we will study, the contrast between them is stark.

       There is a story about a man in a boat who began to drill a hole under
     his feet where he sat. When people in the boat demanded that he stop,
     he responded: “This is none of your business. This is my place!” This
     absurd response is often the excuse used by the sinner to justify his or
     her behavior. “This is my life; it has nothing to do with you.” Of course,
     anything we do or don’t do has an impact on others, especially on those
     nearest to us. Who hasn’t felt, in a big way, the results of other people’s
     actions, either good or bad?
       The principle of unity between the spiritual-moral life and the
     physical-material life is dealt with in verses 3–5. The main idea is that
     wickedness or moral deficiency does not pay, even if one is rich; and
     that righteousness is always rewarding, in one way or another, even if
     one is poor.
       In verses 6 and 7, we see here an earlier expression of what Jesus
     said about how lust is adultery, or hatred akin to murder. Hiding our
     hatred behind our words doesn’t always work, either. Wicked thoughts
     are often betrayed in our body language and the tone of our voice. The
     best possible starting point for good relations with others is, “You shall
     love your neighbor as yourself ” (Lev. 19:18, NKJV; compare with Matt.
     19:19, NKJV). As the texts also suggest, the impression you make for
     good can have a lasting influence on others. In the end, we’re dealing
     with a certain amount of common sense: Isn’t it better to have a good
     name than a bad one?

      What important decision are you going to be making soon? If
      you haven’t already done so, consider carefully the impact that
      choice might have on others, for good or for evil.

     The Mouth of the Righteous
       The mouth (with its components, the lips and the tongue) is the
     most important organ in the book of Proverbs. In the New King James
     Version of the book, the word mouth is used 50 times, lips occurs 41
     times, and tongue 19. The use of this organ in speech is a particularly
     important theme in Proverbs 10–29.
       The basic premise is crucial: our words are very powerful, either
     for good or for evil. The tongue can be the best or the worst gift that
     we’ve been given. This ambivalence about the tongue is one of the most
     important lessons in Proverbs. Indeed, the mouth generates life, but it
     also may bring death.

Read Proverbs 10:11–14. What is the contrast there between how the
     righteous person speaks and how the fool does?
     _________________________________________________________

        In verse 11, notice the expression the “well of life.” It symbolically
     refers to qualities of wisdom. It is used in reference to the Lord (Ps.
     36:9), the Source of life. The same image is used in relation to the
     sanctuary, from which the stream of water springs (Ezek. 47:1, 2). Jesus
     uses this metaphor to illustrate the gift of the Spirit (John 4:14). So the
     comparison of the mouth of the righteous to “a well of life” amounts to
     relating it to God Himself.
        What characterizes this mouth is the positive gift of “life.” This qual-
     ity tells us what the proper function of the mouth should be. It should
     be a force for good, not evil, a source of life, not death. What is being
     said here is seen also in James 3:2–12.
        Remember, too, that it was through speech, through the “word of His
     power” (Heb. 1:3, NKJV), that God created the heavens and the earth.
     Speech, therefore, should serve only creative purposes.

      Consider just how incredibly powerful words are. With your
      words you can fill people with self-confidence, cheer, and hope,
      or you can break them down and damage them as surely as if you
      attacked them physically. How careful are you as you wield the
      power of your tongue?

     The Hope of the Righteous
       “The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness
     of transgressors shall destroy them” (Prov. 11:3). What evidence do we
     have of the truth of this verse? What examples have you seen or heard
     about in which this spiritual truth has been revealed? By contrast, what
     things have you seen that mean, so far at least, that you have to take
     this text by faith?
     _________________________________________________________

Read Proverbs 11. Though it touches on so many topics, what are some
     of the great blessings that come to the faithful as opposed to what
     happens to the wicked?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        The sense of a future and the value of what is not yet seen (see
     2 Cor. 4:18) help motivate the righteous to live rightly. Because of
     their hope in the future, the righteous behave with humility, honesty,
     and compassion.
        On the other hand, wicked people live only in the present; they are
     concerned only with what they see and with the immediate reward. They
     think of themselves before others and will resort to deception and abuse.
     For instance, the salespeople who deceive their customers might perhaps
     get an immediate reward with a higher price, but they ultimately could
     lose their customers, and their business might fail (Prov. 11:3, 18).

      Think about some of the decisions you have to make and how
      you go about making them. How much long-term planning (as in
      eternity) factors into your choices?




                                                                           41

     The Truth of the Righteous
Read Proverbs 12 and focus on the theme of words, especially in the
     context of telling truth or telling lies. What message do we find here
     about honesty and lying?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Philosopher Sissela Bok has convincingly demonstrated how lying
     can be harmful for society. She writes: “A society, then, whose mem-
     bers were unable to distinguish truthful messages from deceptive ones,
     would collapse.”—Lying: Moral Choice in Public and Private Life
     (New York: Pantheon Books, 1978), p. 19. Likewise, Augustine, as
     quoted in the introduction of Bok’s book, noted that “when regard for
     truth has been broken down or even slightly weakened, all things will
     remain doubtful.”—Page xv.
        Ellen G. White wrote: “Lying lips are an abomination to Him. He
     declares that into the holy city ‘there shall in no wise enter . . . any
     thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh
     a lie.’ Let truth telling be held with no loose hand or uncertain grasp.
     Let it become a part of the life. Playing fast and loose with truth, and
     dissembling to suit one’s own selfish plans, means shipwreck of faith.
     . . . He who utters untruths sells his soul in a cheap market. His false-
     hoods may seem to serve in emergencies; he may thus seem to make
     business advancement that he could not gain by fair dealing; but he
     finally reaches the place where he can trust no one. Himself a falsifier,
     he has no confidence in the word of others.”—My Life Today, p. 331.
        When we think of how powerful words are, we must think about
     lying, as well, because most lies are told with words. Who hasn’t felt
     the sting, the betrayal, the sense of defilement when lied to? It’s not
     hard to imagine a society falling into total chaos when lying is the norm
     rather than an aberration from the norm.
        There’s another angle, too: the effect of lying on the one who lies.
     Some people are so used to the practice that it doesn’t bother them;
     many people, though, do feel a sense of guilt, of shame, when they lie.
     Good for them, because that means there is still some receptiveness to
     the Holy Spirit.
        Imagine, though, the danger for the one who lies but doesn’t even
     think twice about it.

      When was the last time you lied? How did you feel when you did it?

     The Reward of the Righteous
       As we have seen in Proverbs, so much of the instruction and teach-
     ing given has been presented by contrasting two types of people. “The
     wise person does this, the fool does that.” “The godly man does that,
     the wicked man does this.”
       Of course, in reality, there’s often a bit of wisdom and foolishness
     in all of us. With the exception of Jesus, we all are sinners, we all fall
     “short of the glory of God” (Rom. 3:23). Fortunately, we have the won-
     derful promise that comes in the next verse: though we are sinners, by
     faith we can be “justified freely by his grace through the redemption
     that is in Christ Jesus” (vs. 24).
       In the end, all humanity is going to be in either one of two camps:
     people who are going to be saved or lost.

Read John 3:16. What two options does all humanity face?
     _________________________________________________________

Read Proverbs 13. How does this chapter contrast the experience and
     fate of the righteous with that of the wicked?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        The wise are compared to a lasting lamp, while the wicked are
     compared to a lamp that will be put out (Prov. 13:9). The wise person
     will enjoy the good fruit of his or her work, while the sinner will reap
     evil (vss. 2, 25). Through their children (vs. 22), the wise have a future
     even beyond themselves; the wicked, instead, will leave their wealth to
     strangers, even to the righteous (vs. 22).
        The point is that a life of faith and obedience to the Lord is better
     than a life of disobedience and folly.

      Putting aside the big issue of the promise of eternal life, what
      are some of the immediate, day-to-day advantages that you have
      experienced through living a life of faith in Christ?


                                                                            43

Further Study: “It is not enough to make a profession of faith in Christ
      and have our names registered on the church roll. . . . Whatever our
      profession, it amounts to nothing unless Christ is revealed in works of
      righteousness.”—Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object Lessons, pp. 312, 313.
         “The greatest deception of the human mind in Christ’s day was that a
      mere assent to the truth constitutes righteousness. In all human experi-
      ence a theoretical knowledge of the truth has been proved to be insuf-
      ficient for the saving of the soul. . . . The darkest chapters of history
      are burdened with the record of crimes committed by bigoted religion-
      ists. . . . The same danger still exists. Many take it for granted that they
      are Christians, simply because they subscribe to certain theological
      tenets. But they have not brought the truth into practical life. . . . Men
      may profess faith in the truth; but if it does not make them sincere, kind,
      patient, forbearing, heavenly-minded, it is a curse to its possessors, and
      through their influence it is a curse to the world.
         “The righteousness which Christ taught is conformity of heart and
      life to the revealed will of God.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages,
      pp. 309, 310.


Discussion Questions:
        Discuss how our decisions impact others for good or for evil.
       Why is this an inescapable fact of life? This truth was first revealed
       in the story of the Fall, where even to this day the impact of Adam’s
       and Eve’s choice is felt in each of our lives. It might be tempting
       to try to measure the amount of good or bad our decisions might
       bring, but that’s risky, because we often don’t know the impact of
       our choices. Why, then, in light of God and His law, must we choose
       to do what’s right, regardless of what we fear the consequences
       might be?

        Proverbs makes a sharp distinction between the righteous and
       the fool, and from these verses we learn about what is right and
       wrong. Why, though, must we be very careful whom we judge as
       fools? On the other hand, how often have we been deceived by
       those whom we once thought were righteous?

                                                    Story
A Light in the World
   Heather Ueeck grew up in Delta Junction, a small town at the end
of the Alaska Highway. As a child, Heather loved going to camp every
summer and kept a record of her experiences, listing her daily activi-
ties. Early on she wrote, “And of course we had to do worship, and
that was dumb.”
   But as the years went by, camp worships became more meaningful
to Heather. One worship that made a big impression involved a candle
and a balloon. “They held a balloon over a lit candle, and the balloon
popped right away. Then they put water into another balloon and held
it over the candle, and it didn’t pop! The presenter explained that we
are like the balloon and the water represents Christ. If we have Christ
in us, He calms us and gives us peace and strength.He’s a resource that
we can latch on 10.”
   Heather now tries to pass on these lessons to campers as she works
at Camp Polaris. “The kids aren’t Adventists, and they don’t come
from the best families. They aren’t used to discipline, to structure, and
people caring about them. They often act up. Sometimes it seems as if
they hate camp, but they keep coming back. Even with the struggles,
underneath they realize that we actually care about them.”
   Heather admits that working at Camp Polaris has taught her patience.
“It’s my job to lead the kids toward God. Patience and flexibility are so
important, and trusting in God. It’s given me a strong tool for facing
situations that will come up in my life—just learning to deal with the
things that this world throws at you. It’s given me an appreciation for
others who have served me and has given me the attitude that I want to
help other people and be a light in the world.”
   Camp Polaris is in need of updated facilities, such as “bear-proof
cabins,” says Heather. And now that the Moodys have left, the only
way to ferry the children to camp is by making several one-and-a-half-
hour trips by small boat. Restroom and bathing facilities include two
outhouses, a steam sauna, and the icy waters of Lake Aleknagik.
   But the primitive accommodations are not a deterrent for Heather.
“I’ve lived in Alaska all my life,” she says, “and [Camp Polaris] is the
most isolated I’ve ever been. But it’s definitely a place where you can
feel very close to God. I really love it up there.”

      What You Get Is Not What
      You See




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Proverbs 14; Dan. 7:25; Mark
      12:30, 31; Prov. 15:3; Isa. 5:20; Proverbs 15; Matt. 20:26–28.

Memory Text: “There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end
      is the way of death” (Proverbs 14:12, NKJV).



      A
               s Paul had said: “We see through a glass, darkly” (1 Cor.
               13:12). We see so little, and what we do see always comes
               filtered through our own minds. Our eyes and ears—all our
      senses, actually—give us only a narrow view of what’s really out there.
         We can be deceived, too, not only about the external world, but about
      ourselves, as well. Our dreams, our views, and our opinions can give us
      very distorted images of what we are really like, and of all deceptions,
      that can be by far the worst.
         What should we do then, to protect ourselves from these deceptions?
      Proverbs provides us with basic counsel. We should not trust ourselves,
      as the fool does. On the contrary, we should trust the Lord, who con-
      trols the course of events even when all seems to go wrong. In short,
      we need to live by faith and not merely by sight, because our sight can
      be exceedingly deceptive, showing only a small portion of what is real,
      and then even worse, distorting the little it does show us.

     The Assurance of the Fool
Read Proverbs 14. What does it say about the fool?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        The fool speaks proudly (Prov. 14:3). The first depiction of the fool
     deals with his “proud speech.” The image of the rod associated with
     the fool’s lips implies his eventual punishment. His proud words have
     resulted in a blow on his lips, an outcome that is seen in contrast with
     the lips of the wise, which are preserved (see also Dan. 7:8).
        The fool mocks wisdom (Prov. 14:6–9). Although the fool seems to
     seek wisdom, in fact he does not believe in it and is skeptical of it. He
     will not find it because, in his own mind, there is no wisdom apart from
     himself. Most frightful is his attitude toward violation of the law. What
     could be more deadly than mocking the idea of sin?
        The fool is credulous (Prov. 14:15). Paradoxically, while the fool
     makes fun of those idealists who still believe in the values of wisdom,
     he has lost his ability to think critically about what he hears; he believes
     “every word.” The irony of this situation strikes at the heart of secular
     society. Skeptical people mock God and make fun of religion, claiming
     that these beliefs are for children and old people, yet they themselves
     often believe in some of the most foolish things, such as the creation of
     life on earth by pure chance alone.
        The fool is impulsive (Prov. 14:16, 29). Because the fool believes
     that he has the truth within himself, he does not take time to think. His
     reaction will be quick, dictated mostly by impulse.
        The fool oppresses others (Prov. 14:21, 31). The mechanisms of
     oppression and intolerance are suggested in the psychology of the fool.
     He is intolerant of others and will treat them with contempt (see Dan.
     7:25; 8:11, 12).

      It’s easy to see the traits of a fool in others, but what about in
      our own selves? Which, if any, of these character flaws might
      you need first to recognize, and then seek by God’s grace to
      overcome?




                                                                              47

        The wise speak humbly (Prov. 14:3). The wise restrain the use of
     their lips. Their silent reflection is motivated by a lack of arrogant
     self-­assurance. The wise give consideration to the other person’s ideas;
     therefore, the wise will take time to think through and weigh the evi-
     dence. They are also silent because they are listening, ready to learn
     from others.
        The wise value learning and knowledge (Prov. 14:6, 18). It is dif-
     ficult for the fool to learn, because it is hard for him to sit at the feet
     of a teacher; in contrast, it is easy for the wise to learn because of their
     humility. They will thus enjoy the experience of learning and growing.
     It is also this search for wisdom, for knowledge that they do not have,
     which makes them wise.
        The wise are cautious (Prov. 14:15). The wise know that sin and evil
     exist. Therefore they will be careful where they walk. They will not trust
     their feelings and personal opinions; they will check things out and ask
     for advice. Yet they will always be careful about what other people say to
     them; they will sort out the good from the bad (1 Thess. 5:21).
        The wise are calm (Prov. 14:29, 33). The wise can stay quiet because
     they do not rely on their “own ways,” but depend on “above” (vs. 14,
     NKJV). It is their faith in God that allows them to relax and exercise
     self-control (Isa. 30:15). It is the fear of God that gives them confi-
     dence (Prov. 14:26).
        The wise are compassionate and sensitive (Prov. 14:21, 31). The two
     commandments, “You shall love the Lord your God” and “You shall
     love your neighbor,” are linked (Mark 12:30, 31, NKJV). We can’t love
     God and at the same time treat other people poorly. The greatest expres-
     sion of our faith is how we deal with others, especially those in need.

      “We do not realize how many of us walk by sight and not by faith.
      We believe the things that are seen, but do not appreciate the
      precious promises given us in His Word.”—Ellen G. White, Our
      High Calling, p. 85. What does it mean to walk by faith and not
      by sight? How are we supposed to do that?

“The Eyes of the Lord”
  “The eyes of the Lord are in every place, keeping watch on the
evil and the good” (Prov. 15:3, NKJV). How does this text make you
feel, and why?
_________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________

_________________________________________________________

   In the next two chapters of Proverbs, the tone changes. These chap-
ters are more theological than the preceding ones. The Lord is refer-
enced more often than in previous proverbs. We are also told something
amazing about Him: that His eyes are in every place (Prov. 15:3).
   This acute consciousness of the Lord’s presence is precisely what the
ancient Israelites called “the fear of the Lord.” The same association is
found in the Psalms: “the eye of the Lord is on those who fear Him”
(Ps. 33:18, NKJV). Likewise, Job describes God as the One who looks
to the ends of the earth and sees all that happens under the heavens (Job
28:24). Because of this, Job concludes that “the fear of the Lord . . .
is wisdom” (Job 28:28).
   This proverb reminds us of God’s ability to see good and evil, no
matter where they are. As Solomon understood (1 Kings 3:9), true
wisdom is the ability to discern between good and evil. On a human
level, this awareness should help us to remember always to do good and
never evil, for God sees all that we do, even if no one else does. We fool
ourselves, thinking that because, for now, we get away with evil, that we
really do get away with it. In the long run, we never do.
   Let us, therefore, be diligent, for “there is no creature hidden from
His sight, but all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom
we must give account” (Heb. 4:13, NKJV).

 Read Proverbs 15:3, Isaiah 5:20, and Hebrews 5:14. What crucial
 message do these verses have for us, especially in an age when the
 very concepts of “good and evil” are often blurred, with people
 claiming that good and evil are relative or just human ideas that
 have no objective existence apart from what we say they are?
 What is so wrong with such a notion of good and evil, and why is
 it so dangerous to hold?




                                                                      49

     The Joy of the Lord
Read Proverbs 15. Why is joy such an important human asset?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Scripture does not promise us a life without trials. As Jesus Himself
     said, “ ‘Sufficient for the day is its own trouble’ ” (Matt. 6:34, NKJV).
     Proverbs 15:15 explains that amid evil days, the one who maintains a
     merry heart will have a better time of it. Pain, suffering, and trials will
     come, and often we can’t control when and how. What we can control,
     at least to some degree, is how we choose to respond.

Read Proverbs 15:14, 23. What is God’s part in this joy?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Although the biblical text does not explicitly mention the reason for
     joy, the parallel thought between verses 13 and 14 suggests that the
     “merry heart” is “the heart of him who has understanding” (NKJV). It
     is the heart of the one who has faith and sees redemption beyond the
     immediate ordeal. This is why faith in God is so important; this is why
     it’s so crucial that we know for ourselves, from our own experience,
     the reality of God and His love. Then, whatever trials come, whatever
     suffering we face, those with understanding can endure, because they
     know for themselves God’s love.
        Proverbs 15:23 brings us another important idea. Joy comes more
     from what we give than from what we receive. It is the good word
     shared with others that will bring joy to the giver. Who hasn’t experi-
     enced the blessings that come from blessing others, whether in word or
     in deed or both? As we have already seen in Proverbs, our words are
     powerful. They can do great good or great evil. And how much better it
     is when they do great good, not only for the one for whom the good is
     done, but for the one who does it.

      How well do you know, for yourself, God’s love? What are things
      you could do that could help open up your heart to this crucial
      truth? Consider how much better life would be if you knew the
      reality of God’s love.

     The Sovereignty of God
       We all dream and make plans, and yet things turn out differently,
     sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. The Bible acknowl-
     edges the value of human responsibility and freedom. Yet the Bible also
     affirms God’s control over the course of events (see Prov. 20:24, 21:31,
     and Daniel 2 and 7).

What does Proverbs 16:1 say? How are we to understand this text?
     _________________________________________________________

        We prepare and make plans, but the last word still belongs to God.
     This does not mean that our preparations are worthless. But in the life
     of faith, if we just submit our plans to God, He will work with them,
     and our plans will be directed (Prov. 16:9) and ultimately established
     by Him (vs. 3). Even the work of our enemies will be used in our behalf
     (vss. 4, 7).
        Though these are not simple ideas to grasp, especially when we face
     difficult situations, they should give us comfort and help us learn to
     trust God, even when things seem to go terribly wrong, and when our
     plans don’t turn out as we had hoped. The key point for us is to learn
     to surrender all to God; if we do that, we can be sure of His guidance,
     even in the hardest times.

Read Proverbs 16:18, 19. What is the place of ambition in human suc-
     cess?
     _________________________________________________________

       As always, the Bible warns against pride. After all, as fallen beings,
     what do we have to be proud of? What vice is more contrary to God
     than pride, the first sin? (See Ezek. 28:17.) Jesus emphatically taught
     about the iniquity of seeking to be great, and He urged His disciples to
     seek humility instead (Matt. 20:26–28).

Read Proverbs 16:33. What is the place of chance in human success?
     _________________________________________________________

        The Bible does not make room for chance. For even when one thinks
     that the course of events is dictated by chance, we can trust that God
     is still in control.

      As we seek to understand why things happen, how does the real-
      ity of the great controversy help us work through some difficult
      issues regarding why things happen as they do?
                                                                          51

Further Study: “From the beginning Satan has portrayed to men the
     gains to be won by transgression. Thus he seduced angels. Thus he
     tempted Adam and Eve to sin. And thus he is still leading multitudes
     away from obedience to God. The path of transgression is made to appear
     desirable; ‘but the end thereof are the ways of death.’ Proverbs 14:12.
     Happy [are] they who, having ventured in this way, learn how bitter are
     the fruits of sin, and turn from it betimes.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs
     and Prophets, p. 720.
        “Nothing tends more to promote health of body and of soul than does
     a spirit of gratitude and praise. It is a positive duty to resist melancholy,
     discontented thoughts and feelings—as much a duty as it is to pray. If
     we are heaven-bound, how can we go as a band of mourners, groan-
     ing and complaining all along the way to our Father’s house? Those
     professed Christians who are constantly complaining, and who seem
     to think cheerfulness and happiness a sin, have not genuine religion.”
     —Ellen G. White, The Ministry of Healing, p. 251.


Discussion Questions:
       Discuss the idea that we have only a limited view of reality.
      What does this mean? What things are out there that we know are
      real, yet we just can’t sense them, in any way? For instance, how
      many radio waves (cell phone calls, satellite programs, radio pro-
      grams) are in the air all around you right now, and yet you can’t
      see, hear, or feel them at all? How should the existence of such
      realities help us to understand how limited our senses are? How
      should this understanding help us to realize the reality of other
      things that we can’t see, such as angels?

       Why is it important to understand the reality of human free
      will and free choice, even if God is ultimately in control? Though
      these concepts (human free choice, God’s sovereignty) seem to be
      in contradiction, both are taught in the Bible, so how can we rec-
      oncile them?

                                                    Story
“They Deserve a Chance Too”
   When Paul and Christie Brown moved into a less-than-desirable
neighborhood in Elkins, West Virginia, they didn’t know that their
home would become a magnet for young people.
   “I’ve always been youth focused,” says Paul, “so when the neighbor-
hood kids wanted to hang out with our kids at the house, we said, ‘OK,
but there are rules:
   “ ‘1. Respect. You will treat yourself and others respectfully, with no
swearing and no name calling.
   “ ‘2. No lying. You lie to me, and it’s done—you are out the door.
   “ ‘3. Health and dietary issues—no drugs, no alcohol, no unclean
meat.’ ”
   Once the young people understood about clean and unclean foods,
they tried sharing what they had learned with their families. “The grand-
father would be cooking a groundhog,” says Paul, “but the kids would
tell him, ‘No! We’re not going to eat that!’ ”
   Before long, the visitors were asking to move in with the Browns.
“Brayden spends every weekend at our house,” says Paul. “It’s his
Sabbath retreat and gets him away from his house.” During the week,
Brayden tries to avoid his abusive, alcoholic stepfather as much as pos-
sible.
   Hunter and Wyatt are two others who spend more time with the
Browns than at home. Coming from difficult situations, both of the
boys feel safe with Paul and Christie, whom they consider to be their
surrogate parents.
   “I try to treat all the kids as if they’re my kids,” says Paul, “because
they deserve a chance too.” That includes providing clothing, bicycles,
and various other items. “Even the vehicle I drive—an extended-cab
truck—is based on how many kids we’re looking after, so we can take
them to and from school.”
   With parental permission, the Browns have taken Brayden and Hunter
with them to Pathfinders and to church and are even paying for them
to attend the local Seventh-day Adventist church school. Unfortunately,
Wyatt’s mother will not give permission for him to join in these activi-
ties; but for Brayden and Hunter, their experience has been life chang-
ing. On November 2, 2013, both boys, along with the Browns’ son, Payton,
were baptized at the Elkins Seventh-day Adventist Church.
   “We’ve been living here for three years now,” Paul says, “and my wife
really feels that the Lord put us in this neighborhood. It’s not where we
would have chosen, but we are sure that the Lord led us here.”

* All names of neighborhood children have been changed.

      Dealing With Fights




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Proverbs 17, 1 Cor. 13:5–7,
      John 8:1–11, Proverbs 18, 19, Deut. 24:10–22.

Memory Text: “Better is a dry morsel with quietness, than a house
      full of feasting with strife” (Proverbs 17:1, NKJV).



      P
             roverbs again denounces the deception of appearances. We may
             seem to have everything the world offers—wealth, power, plea-
             sure, fame—yet, behind the facade, tension and misery flourish.
      It’s even possible that the cause of this tension and misery is precisely
      the wealth and pleasure that people strive so hard for. As an Egyptian
      proverb notes: “Better is bread with a happy heart than wealth with
      vexation.”—Miriam Lichtheim, The New Kingdom, vol. 2 of Ancient
      Egyptian Literature: A Book of Readings (Los Angeles: University of
      California Press, 2006), p. 156. According to the book of Proverbs, the
      first step to solve this problem is to recognize what our priorities are:
      peaceful relationships are more important than wealth (Prov. 17:1).
      What counts is not so much what we have, but who we are within our-
      selves. The advice that follows will help in restoring this priority and
      lead us toward an inner peace (shalom in the Hebrew) that will add to
      our happiness.

      Sin and Friends
Read Proverbs 17:9, 19:11. What crucial point is being made in these texts?
      How should we deal with others who fall?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         When someone messes up, it’s so tempting to spread the story, to tell
      others, Have you heard about what so-and-so did? Though we might
      act as if we are appalled by the action, we still like telling others about
      what happened. In short, we are gossiping, and that’s what we’re being
      warned against, because this behavior will generate contention, even
      between close friends. After all, if a friend of yours messes up, what
      kind of friend are you if you go around telling others about it?
         We are advised instead to “cover” the mistake. This is not, however,
      to imply that we have to hide the sin, to act as if it never happened, as if
      the person never did wrong. The sin that is covered is still present, even
      though hidden. In fact, the Hebrew word for “cover” in that expression
      has the specific connotation of “forgiving” (Ps. 85:2, Neh. 4:5). Love,
      not gossip, should be our response to someone else’s mistake.

Read Proverbs 17:17 and 1 Corinthians 13:5–7. How does love help in
      coping with a friend’s mistake?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         One does not love a friend or spouse because he or she is perfect. We
      love in spite of their mistakes and flaws. Only through love do we learn
      not to judge others, because with our own faults and shortcomings we
      could be just as guilty. Instead, we can mourn with them over what they
      have done, and seek in whatever way we can to help them work through
      it. After all, what are friends for if not for this?

       Think about a time you messed up badly and you were forgiven,
       ministered to, and comforted. What does that tell you about how,
       if possible, you should do the same for others?




                                                                               57

     Be Just!
       True love is not blind. That we “cover” someone’s mistake through
     love does not mean that we do not see the sin and do not recognize it
     as such. Love and justice go together. The Hebrew word for “justice,”
     zedeq, also means “love,” “charity.” We cannot have real compassion if
     we are not just, and we cannot be just if we do not have compassion and
     love. The two concepts must be together.
       For example, the exercise of charity toward the poor should not be
     done at the expense of justice; hence the recommendation not to favor
     the poor in court (Exod. 23:3). If love obliges us to help the poor, it
     would be unjust to favor them when they are wrong, simply because
     they are poor. Justice and truth should therefore go along with love and
     compassion. It is this wise balance that characterizes the torah, the law
     of God, and which is taught and promoted in the book of Proverbs.

Read Proverbs 17:10, 19:25. What do they say about the need for
     rebuke and confrontation?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       The fact that Proverbs 17:10 immediately follows the call to cover
     the mistake through love (vs. 9) is not an accident. This mention of
     “reproof ” in connection with “love” places love in the right perspective.
     The text implies a strong rebuke.

Read John 8:1–11. How do we see Jesus dealing with open sin?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        “In His act of pardoning this woman and encouraging her to live a
     better life, the character of Jesus shines forth in the beauty of perfect
     righteousness. While He does not palliate sin, nor lessen the sense of
     guilt, He seeks not to condemn, but to save. The world had for this
     erring woman only contempt and scorn; but Jesus speaks words of
     comfort and hope. The Sinless One pities the weakness of the sinner,
     and reaches to her a helping hand. While the hypocritical Pharisees
     denounce, Jesus bids her, ‘Go, and sin no more.’ ”—Ellen G. White,
     The Desire of Ages, p. 462.

     Words, Again
Read Proverbs 18. Though different themes are presented here, focus
     on what it has to say about our words. What important concepts are
     presented here regarding what we do or do not say?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        We are again confronted with the reality and power of words; in this
     case we see how fools use their mouths to their own undoing. Verse 13
     is especially enlightening. How easy it is to speak out before carefully
     listening and discerning what has been said to us. How many times
     might we have spared ourselves, and others, undue pain and strife if
     we had only learned to think through carefully what we had just heard
     before responding to it. There is indeed a time when silence is the best
     response.

Read Proverbs 18:4. Why are the words of the wise like deep waters?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       The image of “deep waters” is used positively in the book of Proverbs
     to represent wisdom (Prov. 20:5). It conveys the idea of quiet, but also
     of profundity and riches. The wise are not superficial. They draw their
     words from the depths of personal reflection and experience. Who
     hasn’t marveled sometimes at the deep thoughts and insights from
     those who obviously have wisdom and knowledge?

Read Proverbs 18:21. What does it mean?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Proverbs again tells us what we should already know: our words are
     powerful, and they can be a force for good or evil, even life and death.
     How careful we need to be, then, with how we use this powerful tool.

      Think about a time someone’s words hurt you in a terrible way.
      What should this have taught you about how powerful words
      are? What should it teach you about how careful you need to be
      with what you say?


                                                                          59

     Two Sides to a Story
Read Proverbs 18:2. Why don’t fools need time to form their opinions?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Fools are so sure of themselves and so eager to express their own
     opinions that they are not interested in learning from others. Their
     closed minds go along with their open mouths. This is a deadly combi-
     nation. How careful we need to be that we don’t find ourselves doing
     the same thing, especially on a topic that we are convinced we are right
     about.
       After all, haven’t we all at some point felt very strongly about a sub-
     ject only to find, later on, that we were wrong? This doesn’t mean that
     we should be wishy-washy in our views; it means only that we need
     some humility, in that none of us has all the right answers, and even
     when our answers are right, truth is often deeper and more nuanced
     than we can appreciate or understand.

Read Proverbs 18:17. What important point is given to us here?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Only God does not need a second opinion, precisely because by His
     nature He already has it, for His eyes are everywhere (Prov. 15:3). God
     has the capacity to see all sides of any matter. We, by contrast, generally
     have a very narrow view of everything; a view that tends to get even
     narrower when we get locked into a position, especially on matters that
     we think are important.
       As we should know by now, however, there are always two or even
     more sides to any story, and the more information we have, the better
     we can form the right view of a subject.

      Think of a time you were absolutely convinced of something,
      maybe a view you have held your whole life, only to find out later
      that you had been wrong your whole life. What should this tell
      you about your need to be open to the possibility that you could
      be wrong about things you are fervent about now?

      Be Truthful
         A king needed to appoint a new minister to the highest office of his
      kingdom. For this purpose, he organized a special contest on lying:
      who could utter the biggest lie. All his ministers applied, and each one
      came and spoke their biggest lie. But the king was not satisfied; their
      lies seemed lame. The king then asked his closest and most trusted
      counselor: “Why didn’t you apply?”
         The counselor answered, “I am sorry to disappoint you, Majesty, but
      I cannot apply.”
         “Why not?” asked the king.
         “Because I never lie,” the counselor replied.
         The king decided to appoint him to the position.
         As sinners, lying comes to us easier than we think; for this reason,
      again, how careful we need to be with our words.

Read Proverbs 19. Though many themes are presented there, what does
      it say about lying?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         The book of Proverbs upholds a high ethical standard. It is better to
      remain poor, or even to lose a promotion, if we have to lie in order to get
      it, if we have to sacrifice our integrity (Prov. 19:1), if we have to cheat,
      or if it comes at the price of faithfulness (vs. 22).


Read Proverbs 19:9. What is the responsibility of a witness?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        Lying, in and of itself, is bad enough; but doing it in court and under
     oath is even worse. In many countries perjury is a crime, and a seri-
     ous one at that. The witness must therefore give a truthful testimony.
     It is no accident that this verse follows the mention of a “friend to one
     who gives gifts” (vs. 6, NKJV), and of the poor who are hated by their
     friends and even their brothers (vs. 7, NKJV). The point is, witnesses
     must not be influenced by bribes or by the social status of those they
     are testifying about.

       Read Deuteronomy 24:10–22. What important principle is seen
       here, and how should we apply this to ourselves and to our deal-
       ings with those who are needy?
                                                                               61

Further Study: “The spirit of gossip and talebearing is one of Satan’s
      special agencies to sow discord and strife, to separate friends, and to
      undermine the faith of many in the truthfulness of our positions. Brethren
      and sisters are too ready to talk of the faults and errors that they think
      exist in others, and especially in those who have borne unflinchingly the
      messages of reproof and warning given them of God.”—Ellen G. White,
      Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, p. 195.
         “The children of these complainers listen with open ears and receive
      the poison of disaffection. Parents are thus blindly closing the avenues
      through which the hearts of the children might be reached. How many
      families season their daily meals with doubt and questionings. They
      dissect the characters of their friends, and serve them up as a dainty
      dessert. A precious bit of slander is passed around the board to be
      commented upon, not only by adults, but by children. In this God is
      dishonored. Jesus said: ‘Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the
      least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto Me.’ Therefore Christ is
      slighted and abused by those who slander His servants.”—Testimonies
      for the Church, vol. 4, page 195.

Discussion Questions:
        It’s always hard when those you love or care about mess up.
       And it’s so easy to try to cover up for them. How do we strike the
       right balance in situations like these? Certainly, we need to show
       grace, as we have been shown grace for our errors—that goes
       without saying. But does grace always, or ever, mean that a person
       can sin with impunity and not face consequences? What then is
       the right course to take in situations like these?

        As the lesson said this week, most things in life are very com-
       plicated and have many facets to them. So, even those things we
       happen to be right about will usually be more complex than we
       understand them to be. How can we learn to be open-minded
       while at the same time not being foolish about it?

        What are some ways we can lie without ever using words?

“Your Parents Should Be Very
Proud of You”
  “My dog’s been shot!” Brayden blurted out in tears to his friend
Payton. “Would you speak at his funeral?”
  Twelve-year-old Payton had never conducted a funeral, but wanting
to help his friend, he agreed to do what he could. “I planned the whole
thing out,” he said. “The dog is buried in my yard—Brayden and I dug
his grave.” After Payton performed the eulogy, the boys added the dog’s
dish, collar, and squeaky toy before filling the grave.
  When Payton and his family first moved into the neighborhood,
Payton befriended Brayden and learned about the struggles he was fac-
ing at home. “I told him that I was a Christian and shared my beliefs
with him,” says Payton, “and then he told me, ‘I want to try that out!’ ”
  Brayden began spending more time at Payton’s house and often spent
the night—especially on Fridays, so he could go with Payton and his
family to church the next day. Before long, Brayden’s cousin, Hunter,
wanted to stay with Payton too, “So I was housing three people in my
room,” Payton explains.
  While Payton’s bedroom may be small, his heart is big. He
befriended another neighbor, Wyatt, whose father committed suicide.
Wyatt had been kicked out of several public schools at the age of 13,
and his mother didn’t know what to do with him. Payton spent time
with Wyatt and invited him to come with him to Pathfinders and to
church, along with the other boys, but Wyatt’s mother would not allow
her son to join in.
  During the next three years, Payton often shared his faith with Wyatt,
and one day after hearing that they might be moving, Wyatt handed
Payton and his sister, Stormy, a note. The note is so precious that
Payton keeps it in the family safe.
   “Dear Payton and Stormy,
   “Before you move, I want to thank you. When you first came, I had
lost my way. I stopped going to church and didn’t plan on coming back.
When we became friends, I was trying to act tough, but on the inside,
I wanted to be more like you, Payton. When the hard times came and
I lost my father, talking to you was a comfort. I learned about God
through you. You were and still are a hero, inspiration, and role model
to me. Your parents should be very proud of you, knowing that you
helped me find Jesus.”

      Words of Wisdom




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Proverbs 20; 1 Cor. 12:14–26;
      Jer. 9:23, 24; Proverbs 21; Matt. 25:35–40; Proverbs 22.

Memory Text: “Most men will proclaim each his own goodness, but
      who can find a faithful man?” (Proverbs 20:6, NKJV).



      T
              o some degree (a great degree, actually), we are all products of
              our environment. Though heredity plays a big role, the values
              we hold come to us from what is around us—our home, our
      education, our culture. From infancy we are impacted by what we see
      and hear.
        Unfortunately, what we see and hear isn’t always the best for us; the
      world around us is fallen in every way, and it cannot help impacting us
      negatively. Nevertheless, we have been given the promise of the Holy
      Spirit, and we have God’s Word, which points us to something higher
      and better than the world does.
        This week we will look at various proverbs and the practical truths
      they express, truths that, if taken to heart and followed, can, indeed,
      help us to overcome the negativity of this fallen world and prepare us
      for a better one.

     We Are All Equal
Read Proverbs 20:12. What does this teach us about the value of all
     humans?
     _________________________________________________________

        Unlike the theory of evolution, which considers us all to be nothing
     but chance products of a mindless cosmos, the Bible teaches that all
     humans were created by God (see also Acts 17:26). It is no accident,
     either, that Thomas Jefferson asserted the equality of all humans pre-
     cisely because they were “created” by God. It’s in the Lord, and in Him
     alone, that we have our equality.
        Now, though we all have the same Maker, this doesn’t mean we are
     all the same. Even identical twins don’t wind up behaving exactly
     alike. In Corinthians, Paul talks about our differences, and stresses
     that they should not lead to a sense of superiority but should, instead,
     help us to see our need for one another. “The eye cannot say to the
     hand, ‘I have no need of you’; nor again the head to the feet, ‘I have
     no need of you’ ”(1 Cor. 12:21, NKJV).

Read Proverbs 20:9. What else makes us all equal?
     _________________________________________________________

        Sin is another universal equalizer. To the rhetorical question of the
     proverb, the answer “no one” points to the tragic and hopeless condi-
     tion of humankind. Humans are all weak and mortal, and all the money
     and power in the world will not change that. Yet, in the context of
     the Scriptures, this reference to human sinfulness should not lead to
     despair, because Jesus’ death on the cross and His resurrection have
     paved the way for anyone, no matter how sinful, to have the promise
     of eternal life. And this life comes solely through faith in Him—not by
     our works.
        “If man cannot, by any of his good works, merit salvation, then
     it must be wholly of grace, received by man as a sinner because he
     receives and believes in Jesus. It is wholly a free gift. Justification by
     faith is placed beyond controversy. And all this controversy is ended, as
     soon as the matter is settled that the merits of fallen man in his good
     works can never procure eternal life for him.”—Ellen G. White, Faith
     and Works, p. 20.

      Do you ever find yourself feeling superior (or inferior) to other
      people? (You shouldn’t be comparing yourself to others anyway.)
      If so, what should the Cross tell you about the equality of us all?



                                                                            65

      The Test of Life
         “ ‘Their works follow them,’ ” says Revelation 14:13 (NKJV) about the
      reward of the righteous. Only the future will testify to the real value of
      the individual. People may boast now of their wealth, their knowledge,
      their physical prowess, and maybe that is all true. But what does it mean
      in the sight of God? So often the traits, accomplishments, and deeds that
      humans uplift as important or impressive are shown to be the meaning-
      less dross that they really are. After all, look at some of the despicable
      characters, often in the entertainment industry, who are all but worshiped
      and adored by fans. What we idolize and worship presents a powerful
      testimony to how fallen we are.

Read Proverbs 20:6 (see also Jer. 9:23, 24; Mark 9:35). What are these
      texts telling us about what is of true value to God?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         It is not the single sensational act of love or sacrifice that will demon-
      strate the high quality of our relationships, but the long and regular series
      of small actions that we perform day by day, patiently and surely. The
      daily meal served to your spouse, the constant attention to a sick parent,
      the continued effort in your job; all these humble acts throughout life are
      the evidence that your faith is authentic. Enduring faithfulness is more
      valuable than intense but rare acts of love.
         This principle holds true for our relationship with God, as well. It is
      more difficult and more valuable to live for God than to die for Him, if
      for no other reason than that living takes more time than dying. The saint
      who lives for God is greater than the martyr who dies for Him. Anyone
      can claim to believe in God and to serve Him; the question is: Does it
      last? Or, as Jesus said, “ ‘He who endures to the end shall be saved’ ”
      (Matt. 24:13, NKJV).

       How, through patience, kindness, and a willingness to meet oth-
       er’s needs, can you reveal to someone something of the character
       of Christ? How willing are you to do this, no matter the cost to
       yourself?

      Waiting for the Lord
Read Proverbs 20:17, 21:5. What practical lesson can we find in these
      texts?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         The thief who steals bread gets it faster than the one who has to work
      for it. Salespeople who lie to sell their bad merchandise may become
      rich faster than the honest merchant (compare Prov. 21:5 to the next
      verse). Yet, says the proverb, the future will turn the sweetness into
      “gravel,” and the hastily acquired wealth will become poverty. The text
      gives a number of examples to illustrate the accuracy of this observa-
      tion:
         1. The Inheritance (Prov. 20:21). The mention of an inheritance
      obtained too quickly (implying that the parents are still alive) follows
      the condemnation of the one who curses his parents (vs. 20). The asso-
      ciation of these two proverbs is significant. It is as if the son (or the
      daughter) curses the parents and also wishes them dead. The child may
      even have plotted the death of the parents in order to get the inheri-
      tance. The prospect of this behavior is tragic: the lamp he is presently
      enjoying will become “deep darkness” (vs. 20, NKJV) and his curse
      against his parents will turn on him, for he “will not be blessed at the
      end” (vs. 21, NKJV).
         2. Revenge (Prov. 20:22). This time the proverb addresses the vic-
      tim who may be tempted to seek revenge for the evil that has been
      committed against him. The counsel is just to “wait for the Lord”
      (NKJV). Only then will you be saved, which implies that if you do
      seek revenge you are taking a serious risk. Proverbs 25:21, 22 empha-
      sizes the same instruction, using the metaphor of heaping coals of fire
      on the enemy’s head, an Egyptian ritual expressing repentance and
      conversion. If you refrain from revenge, promises Proverbs 20:22,
      you will be saved by the Lord and, in the process (adds Proverbs
      25:21, 22) you will save your enemy, thus overcoming evil with good
      (Rom. 12:21).

       How can you learn to emulate the character of Christ more
       closely when it comes to overcoming evil with good? Why is this
       so contrary to our inherent nature? Why is death to self the only
       way to achieve this end?




                                                                            67

     Compassion for the Poor
       A person’s character is measured less by wisdom or even religious
     commitments than by readiness to help the poor and the needy. It is
     not what you have that measures your character. Who you are to your
     neighbor is the measure of character. The Samaritan who saves his
     neighbor is closer to the kingdom of God than the spiritual priest (Luke
     10:26–37). The book of Proverbs emphasizes and explains this priority.
       For God’s sake: The first reason to make this a priority lies in God
     Himself, who prefers human compassion for the poor over our religious
     zeal (Prov. 19:17, 21:13). Your sensitivity to the poor and your concrete
     deeds on their behalf will count more with God than will any of your
     pious acts. In fact, God is personally invested in that work, so much so
     that, when we give to the poor, it is as if we are giving to God Himself
     (Matt. 25:35–40).

Read Matthew 25:35–40. What does this tell us about how Jesus iden-
     tifies so closely with those in need? How should this truth impact
     how we relate to such people?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       For the sake of the poor: The second reason lies within the poor
     person, whom God has created just as He has created the rich person
     (Prov. 22:2). The equality between humans, based on the fact that God
     has created them all, makes the poor as worthy of attention as the rich
     person. We should love our neighbors for who they are: beings made
     in the image of God.
       At the same time, think about how much good it does you to help
     those in need. Our basic natures are selfish; by default we tend to look
     out for ourselves over and above others. By giving of ourselves, we
     learn to die to self and to better reflect Christ’s character, and what is
     of more value to us than that?

      In what ways do you get a greater sense of personal satisfaction
      from helping others in need than only doing things for yourself?

     Education
       The Hebrew word for “education” comes from a word that means
     “to build up” and “to begin.” All these meanings are contained in the
     Hebrew idea of education: when we “train up a child” (Prov. 22:6), we
     build up, we begin, and we lay the groundwork for the future. Parents
     and educators are therefore responsible for their children’s future and,
     by implication, the future of the world. What we do with our children
     today will impact society for generations to come.

Read Proverbs 22:6. What does this say about the importance of edu-
     cating children correctly?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        It is significant that the Hebrew word for “educate” is the very word
     used for the “dedication” of the temple (1 Kings 8:63). Early education
     means to dedicate our children to God in the same way that the temple is
     dedicated to God. Education has an impact on our salvation, even beyond
     our own life. “To parents is committed the great work of educating and
     training their children for the future, immortal life.”—Ellen G. White,
     Child Guidance, p. 38. Such education has an eternal effect. The apostle
     Paul seems to allude to Proverbs 22:6 when he commends Timothy for
     his early training in the knowledge of “the Holy Scriptures, which are
     able to make you wise for salvation” (2 Tim. 3:15, NKJV).

Read Proverbs 22:8, 15. What principles do we find here?
     _________________________________________________________
     _________________________________________________________
     _________________________________________________________

       Education can be compared to the activity of “sowing.” The future
     of our society and of our children depends on what we have sown. If
     our seed was “iniquity,” then our education (“the rod”) will fail, and we
     shall reap trouble (vs. 8). If our seed touched the hearts of the children
     (vs. 15), then the rod of our education will drive the children’s foolish-
     ness far from them.

      We so often teach others (especially children) by our example.
      Think about your example: What kind of legacy are you leaving?
      In what areas, if any, might your example be better?
                                                                            69
                   F riday February 20

Further Study: “Parents should be models of truthfulness, for this is the
      daily lesson to be impressed upon the heart of the child. Undeviating
      principle should govern parents in all the affairs of life, especially in the
      education and training of their children. . . . Parents, never prevaricate;
      never tell an untruth in precept or in example. If you want your child
      to be truthful, be truthful yourself.”—Ellen G. White, Child Guidance,
      p. 151.
         “Many fathers and mothers seem to think that if they feed and clothe
      their little ones, and educate them according to the standard of the world,
      they have done their duty. They are too much occupied with business or
      pleasure to make the education of their children the study of their lives.
      They do not seek to train them so that they will employ their talents for
      the honor of their Redeemer. Solomon did not say, ‘Tell a child the way
      he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it.’ But, ‘Train
      up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart
      from it.’ ”—Ellen G. White, Child Guidance, p. 38.

Discussion Questions:
        Dwell more on the idea of Proverbs 22:6. Why must we be
       careful in how we apply this? That is, many parents have done a
       good job in rearing their children, and yet as adults those chil-
       dren make wrong choices. Why must we never forget the reality of
       free will and the reality of the great controversy as we look at the
       meaning of this text?

        Look again at the final question at the end of Wednesday’s
       study. What does it tell us about ourselves that we get such a sense
       of satisfaction from helping others, especially when we get noth-
       ing in return? What should this truth tell us about why so many
       people who have so much of the world’s riches are miserable none-
       theless?

        Though we are not all equal in talents, education, experience,
       and so forth, we are equal in the most important thing: we all need
       the Cross for salvation. What should this teach us about the basic
       equality and worth of all human beings? More so, how should this
       truth impact how we treat all people?

   One day I asked Payton why they were always away on Saturdays. I
thought it was weird that I couldn’t do any work for them on that day.
Payton invited me to come to church with them. I liked it, but after a
while I started slacking off. Six months later I was back—this time to
stay.
   I joined the Pathfinder Club. As we were coming back from a
campout, Payton, my cousin Hunter, and I were talking about school.
Hunter and I didn’t like our school because there were so many fights.
Hunter said that he hoped to someday go to a Christian college. Payton
asked, “Why don’t you just go to a Christian school?” Our parents
agreed to let us go to Highland Adventist School here in Elkins, and
Paul found sponsors for us. I like the school a lot. The teachers and
staff are really nice, and the students are friendly, not fighting.
   One day as we were going to church, Payton said he wanted to get
baptized. Hunter and I said that we wanted to get baptized with him.
So we all took Bible studies together and were baptized on November
2, 2013.
   The church members are the nicest people I’ve ever met. They are
always there for you. And the pastor, Dan, there’s something about his
preaching that just sticks with me. I like the people here a lot; they are
like my second family that I’ve always wanted.
   Being able to come here and know about the Seventh-day Adventist
Church has been a real blessing to me. No one else in my family are
Adventists. They don’t understand why I don’t do some things I used to
do. My stepdad can’t understand why I don’t eat pork—all my life I’ve
eaten it, and at first it was hard not to eat it. But I’m glad I went off of
it. I’ve seen a change in my weight and my personality. Everything has
gone up since I was baptized.

      Words of Truth




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Proverbs 22, 23, Exod. 22:21–
      27, Proverbs 24, Eph. 5:20, Ezek. 33:8.

Memory Text: “Have I not written to you excellent things of coun-
      sels and knowledge, that I may make you know the certainty of the
      words of truth, that you may answer words of truth to those who
      send to you?” (Proverbs 22:20, 21, NKJV).



      S
             ome of this week’s proverbs show parallels with Egyptian texts.
             Under inspiration, Solomon might have shaped these texts
             according to a specifically Hebrew perspective. Here, the words
      of the Egyptians meet the Spirit of Israel’s God, and thus they became
      divine revelation.
         This observation is important, for it reminds us of the universal
      character of “truth.” What is true for the Israelite should also be true
      for the Egyptian; otherwise, it would not be the truth. It is important to
      remember that God’s truths apply universally, to everyone.
         The domain of these admonitions is common to both communities.
      That is, whoever you are, whether a believer or not, and wherever you
      live, there are some things that you should not do.

     The Knowledge of Truth
Read Proverbs 22:17, 18. What are we being told about how truth
     should impact our lives?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       The first duty of the student is to listen and pay attention: “Incline
     your ear and hear” (Prov. 22:17, NKJV). In other words: “Concentrate!”
     The crucial point is that the seeker of truth must be earnest, must truly
     want to learn what is right, and then do it.
       But it is not enough for the student to listen or even to understand,
     intellectually, what is being taught. Some people who have a lot of
     biblical facts in their heads have no real knowledge or experience with
     the Truth itself (John 14:6).
       Instead, truth should reach the innermost part of the human being.
     The Hebrew phrase in Proverbs 22:18, “within you” (NKJV), refers
     to the stomach. The lesson should not stay on the surface; it has to
     be digested, assimilated, and become an inner part of our beings.
     Once the message has gone deep into our system and becomes rooted
     within us, it will then rise to our lips, and we can have a powerful
     testimony.

Read Proverbs 22:19–21. What should an experience in truth do for us?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        1. Faith (vs. 19). The first goal of the teaching of wisdom is not wis-
     dom per se. Proverbs does not aim at making more intelligent and more
     skillful disciples. The teacher’s objective is to strengthen the disciple’s
     trust in the Lord.
        2. Conviction (vs. 21). Students should know why these “words of
     truth” (NKJV) are certain; they should know why they believe what
     they do. Faith by definition is belief in what we don’t fully understand.
     Nevertheless, we still should have good reasons for that faith.
        3. Responsibility (vs. 21). The last step of education is to share with
     others those “words of truth” (NKJV) we have received. This is central
     to our whole calling as a people.

      Think about all the powerfully logical reasons we have for our
      Seventh-day Adventist faith. What are these reasons, and why
      should we never hesitate in keeping them ever before us and shar-
      ing them with others? Bring your answer to class on Sabbath.
                                                                             73

     Robbing the Poor
Read Proverbs 22:22, 23; 23:10. What are we warned about here?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Though it’s always wrong to steal, this prohibition concerns stealing
     from the poor and the oppressed, who are the most vulnerable. They
     are truly helpless, and therefore they qualify for God’s special concern
     (Exod. 22:21–27). The case of David, who killed Uriah in order to steal
     his wife, and Nathan’s parable of the ewe lamb (2 Sam. 12:1–4) come
     to mind. Robbing from the poor is not just a criminal act: it is a sin
     “against the Lord” (2 Sam. 12:13). To take from someone who has less
     than what you have is worse than stealing; it is also an act of cowardice.
     Do these thieves think that God doesn’t see their actions?
       Indeed, Proverbs 22:23 implies that even if the thief gets away with
     no human punishment, God will repay. The reference to the Redeemer,
     the Goel (Prov. 23:11), may even allude to the divine scenario of end-
     time judgment (Job 19:25).
       So, this warning, along with others in the Bible, speaks against those
     who are interested only in the immediate “gains” of their actions, and
     not the long-term results. They take possession and enlarge their prop-
     erties at the expense of others, and they are willing to cheat and kill
     for that purpose. They may enjoy it now, but they will pay later. This
     reasoning should not only discourage the thief; it should show that our
     ethical values are intricately tied to the Sovereignty of God.

      In England, some atheists had the following slogan placed on
      city buses: “There’s probably no God. Now stop worrying and
      enjoy your life.” Though there are many retorts one could give in
      response, think about this one: if there were no God, then those
      who steal from the poor, and are getting away with it now, really
      have nothing to worry about. Indeed, all those who have done great
      evil and seem to have gotten away with it will, in fact, have really
      gotten away with it. How should faith in God and in His promises
      of judgment help to give us some peace of mind regarding all the
      injustice we see in the world now?

     Being Jealous of the Wicked
What do Proverbs 23:17; 24:1, 2; and 24:19, 20 warn us about?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Why would someone envy the wicked? Most likely it’s not because of
     the actual sins that they might be committing. Rather, it’s usually because
     of the immediate gain (wealth, success, power) that they achieve through
     their wickedness—that’s what people often covet for themselves.
        Though, of course, not every successful or rich person is wicked,
     some are—and they are probably the kind of people we are being
     warned about in these verses. We see their “good” life and, from our
     perspective, especially if we are struggling ourselves, it’s easy to envy
     what they have.
        This, though, is a very narrow and shortsighted view of things. After
     all, the temptation of sin is that its reward is immediate: we enjoy the
     present gratification. A perspective beyond the present can protect us
     from temptation; that is, we need to look beyond the immediate “gains”
     of our sin and think through the long-term consequences.
        Besides, who hasn’t seen just how destructive sin is? We never get
     away with it. We might be able to hide it from others so that no one,
     even those closest to us, has a clue about what we are doing (though
     sooner or later they catch on, don’t they?); or we might be able to
     delude ourselves into thinking that our sins are not that bad. (After all,
     look at how many people do worse things!) But sooner or later, one way
     or another, sin catches up with us.
        We should hate sin because it is sin. We should hate it because of
     what it has done to us, to our world, and to our Lord. If we want to see
     the real cost of sin, look at Jesus on the cross. This is what our sin has
     cost. That realization alone should be enough (though so often it isn’t)
     to make us want to avoid sin and to keep away as much as possible from
     those who would lead us into it.

      Have you ever struggled with envy over someone’s success?
      What’s the best remedy for this spiritually deadly problem? (See
      Eph. 5:20.)




                                                                            75

     What We Put in Our Mouths
        It is no accident that the first human temptation concerned food (Gen.
     3:3). It was being disobedient and eating of the wrong thing that brought
     sin and death into the world (Gen. 3:1–7, Rom. 5:12). We shouldn’t miss
     the hard fact, too, that the first mention of wine drinking in the Bible is
     presented in a terribly negative and degrading story (Gen. 9:21).

Read Proverbs 23:29–35. How is the use of alcohol presented in these
     verses?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Who hasn’t seen personally just how devastating alcohol can be? Sure,
     not everyone who drinks becomes a drunk in the gutter. But most likely
     drunks in the gutter never imagined, the first time they took a drink, that
     they would eventually wind up in the gutter.
        “The man who has formed the habit of drinking intoxicating liquor, is
     in a desperate situation. He cannot be reasoned with, or persuaded to deny
     himself the indulgence. His stomach and brain are diseased, his will power
     is weakened, and his appetite uncontrollable. The prince of the powers of
     darkness holds him in bondage that he has no power to break.”—Ellen G.
     White Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1162.

Read Proverbs 23:1–8. Why should we control our appetites?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        This admonition is about more than table manners. The biblical text
     is a warning to those who like to eat and who have great appetites (Prov.
     23:2). The metaphor of putting a knife to one’s throat is particularly
     strong: it not only means curbing the appetite, but also suggests the
     risk to your health and even your life that could be caused by overeat-
     ing. The Hebrew word (bin), translated “consider carefully,” expresses
     the idea of carefully deciding between eating various kinds of food.
     The same word is used by Solomon when he asks for wisdom to help
     him “discern [bin] between good and evil” (1 Kings 3:9, NKJV). The
     inspired writer has more in mind than just the issue of appetite control.
     His counsel may also concern banquets and social drinking, when we
     are pressured and tempted to “desire his delicacies” (Prov. 23:3, NKJV).

      Think about someone you know whose life has been destroyed by
      alcohol. Why should that example alone be enough to help you to
      understand why you should never put that poison in your body?

     Our Responsibilities
        “When I say to the wicked, ‘O wicked man, you shall surely die!’
     and you do not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked
     man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your
     hand” (Ezek. 33:8, NKJV). What basic spiritual principle is revealed
     here? How do we take this concept and apply it to our everyday
     lives?

        Years ago, in a big Western city, a woman was being attacked at
     night on a street. She cried out for help; dozens heard her, yet not one
     person even bothered to call the police. Most people looked out the
     window and then went back to whatever they were doing. Soon the
     woman’s cries stopped. Later, she was found dead, stabbed numerous
     times.
        Were the people who heard her cries but did nothing responsible for
     her death? Though they hadn’t attacked her themselves, did their inac-
     tion kill her?

Read Proverbs 24:11, 12, 23–28. What important messages are here
     for us?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       The law of Moses clearly warns that those who fail to report what
     they witness will bear guilt (Lev. 5:1). We may not be able to act against
     crime, but if we keep silent about what we see, we then share the guilt
     with the criminal. By our silence, we become accomplices.
       On the other hand, if we report the truth in our testimony, giving the
     “right answer” (Prov. 24:26), we respond appropriately and behave as
     responsible people. This act is compared to a kiss on the lips, meaning
     that the person cares about another person.

      It’s tragic enough to remain silent and do nothing as a woman
      is being murdered on your street. But what about many of the
      other evils in the world: hunger, war, injustice, racism, economic
      oppression? What are our responsibilities here, as well?
                                                                            77

Further Study: “Souls around us must be aroused and saved, or they
     perish. Not a moment have we to lose. We all have an influence that
     tells for the truth or against it. I desire to carry with me unmistakable
     evidences that I am one of Christ’s disciples. We want something besides
     Sabbath religion. We need the living principle, and to daily feel indi-
     vidual responsibility. This is shunned by many, and the fruit is careless-
     ness, indifference, a lack of watchfulness and spirituality.”—Ellen G.
     White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1, p. 99.
        “Talk faith, live faith, cultivate love to God; evidence to the world
     all that Jesus is to you. Magnify His holy name. Tell of His goodness;
     talk of His mercy, and tell of His power.”—Ellen G. White, Our High
     Calling, p. 20.

Discussion Questions:
       In class, go over your answer to Sunday’s final question. What
      can we learn from each other’s answers? What are ways that we
      can learn to build up our faith in what we believe?

       Someone wrote: “Remember two things: Christ died for
      you, and you will one day die.” In the context of Tuesday’s study,
      which talked about how we will have to answer for sin one way
      or another, what crucial lesson should we take away from this
      thought?

       Here again is the quote put on the buses in London: “There’s
      probably no God. Now stop worrying and enjoy your life.” Besides
      what the lesson talked about, what other problems do you find
      with that sentiment? Why would God’s existence be something
      that would make people worry to begin with? What does this sen-
      timent tell us about how well Satan has distorted the character of
      God in the minds of many people? In class, come up with different
      ways in which you could respond to that slogan. What are some
      short, pithy slogans that could help people to see the hope that we
      can have in God?

Helping Mission Succeed
  When Dan Jacko isn’t busy helping people learn to walk again, he’s
assisting his church members with their spiritual walk. Pastor Dan, a
professional physical therapist, is also serving as a lay pastor for the
Mountain View Conference in the two church district of Elkins and
Parsons, West Virginia. He also teaches biology and chemistry to the
academy level students at Highland Adventist School in Elkins. His
wife, Cheryl, is an educator and registered nurse and serves as the
principal of the kindergarten through twelfth grade school. Their son,
Jeremy, teaches Bible, math, and history.
  Believing mission is important, every other year, Pastor Dan leads the
students and church members on a mission trip. So far, they’ve been to
Mexico, Panama, Honduras, and, in 2014, Costa Rica.
  While in Costa Rica, they built a church during the day and presented
evangelistic meetings and Vacation Bible Schools in four different
churches in the evenings. In spite of his own full schedule, Pastor Dan
was impressed with the dedication of the pastor in Costa Rica, who
shepherds six churches and doesn’t have a car.
  Not only do Pastor Dan and his members build churches abroad—
they also build them at home, where they recently completed their own
church and school, located on five and a half acres (2.2 hectares), com-
pletely debt-free.
  The most recent challenge for Pastor Dan and the 80-member Elkins
church is keeping up with the many Bible study requests coming from
their community. Over the course of three mailings in 2013 and 2014,
everyone in the state of West Virginia received an invitation for the Voice
of Prophecy’s Discover Bible course. The response was overwhelming—
with 10,000 people indicating that they would like to have Bible studies.
Of that number, more than 200 came from the Elkins and Parsons area.
  “Some are face-to-face Bible studies,” explains Pastor Dan, “and oth-
ers prefer to take them by correspondence, which are then graded by our
local church members.” The local churches are responsible for purchas-
ing the lessons and providing postage for correspondence students.
  “What makes this area even more of a mission field,” says Pastor Dan,
“is that you’ll get a lot of people who say, ‘I believe this,’ but if their
family isn’t in favor of it, a lot of them just won’t make the commitment.”
  Nevertheless, Pastor Dan and the small churches he leads see reaching
people for Jesus in their territory as an important mission and are willing
to give the time, effort, and funds needed to help it succeed.

      Behind the Mask

Read for This Week’s Study: Prov. 25:2, 3; 26:11, 12;
      1 Cor. 1:20, 21; Prov. 26:13–16; 27:5, 6.

Memory Text: “Do not exalt yourself in the presence of the king, and
      do not stand in the place of the great” (Proverbs 25:6, NKJV).



      B
             ehind the dazzling serpent, who utters sweet words and who
             seems so concerned with Eve’s happiness, hides the enemy who
             plots her death (Gen. 3:1–6). Disguised as “an angel of light,”
      Satan prepares the most dangerous traps for humankind (2 Cor. 11:14).
      Even more dangerous and deceitful is self-pretension; when we claim
      to be what we are not, we end up cheating others and even ourselves.
         There are different ways to deceive. One of the most common is
      through language. Some of the proverbs this week deal with words,
      lying words, flattering words, pretty words that use nice sounds and
      wonderful sentiments to cover ugly thoughts and intentions. We need
      to be careful not only about what we say to others, but about how we
      interpret what others say to us. Perhaps this week’s message could be
      summed up this way: “Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst
      of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves”
      (Matt. 10:16).

     The Mystery of God
        Life is full of mysteries. Physicist David Deutsch wrote that “every-
     day events are stupendously complex when expressed in terms of
     fundamental physics. If you fill a kettle with water and switch it on, all
     the supercomputers on Earth working for the age of the universe could
     not solve the equations that predict what all those water molecules
     will do—even if we could somehow determine their initial state and
     that of all the outside influences on them, which is itself an intractable
     task.”—David Deutsch, The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That
     Transform the World (New York: Penguin, 2011), Kindle edition, loca-
     tions 1972–1975.
        If we are confounded about something as mundane as water mol-
     ecules, how could we even begin to expect to understand the mysteries
     of God?

Read Proverbs 25:2, 3. What point is the author making, and how can
     we apply it to a broader situation?

        What makes the glory of God different from the glory of kings is His
     “mysterious” nature, and by implication our human incapacity to fully
     understand Him. The Hebrew root str (“conceal,” “hide”), from which
     comes our word mystery, is often used in the Hebrew Scriptures to char-
     acterize what makes God the only true God (Isa. 45:14, 15). There are
     things about God that we simply cannot understand. On the other hand,
     what makes the glory of kings is their willingness to be scrutinized.
     Transparency and accountability should be the first quality of leader-
     ship (Deut. 17:14–20). It is the king’s duty to “search out a matter”; that
     is, to give an explanation for events and for what he is doing.

      Life is so full of unanswered questions, isn’t it? In a split second,
      seemingly random events can mean the difference between life
      and death. Some people go from one tragedy to another, while
      others do fine. All this should tell us that we need to live by faith.
      What things are happening right now in your life that you have to
      accept by faith, trusting in God? What other choice do you have?

      The Fool as Wise
         Though not a recent fabrication (especially in the Western world), the
      idea has taken hold in recent years that argues for the relative nature
      of truth. That is, what is true for one person, or one culture, might not
      be true for another. While on one level this is always correct (some
      places drive on the right side of the road, others on the left), on another
      it’s a dangerous error, especially in the moral realm. Certain things are
      right and others are wrong, regardless of where we live or our personal
      preferences. In the end, we must always submit our views to the Word
      of God and the truths found there. God’s Word must be our ultimate
      source for knowing right and wrong, good and evil.

Read Proverbs 26:11, 12. (See also Judg. 21:25; 1 Cor. 1:20, 21; 2:6, 7;
      2 Cor. 1:12.) What must we all be careful not to do?

         As we can see, this idea of doing what is right in one’s own eyes
      is nothing new. Yet it was as wrong then as it is now. As we have
      already seen, none of us understands everything; in fact, we don’t
      fully understand anything. We all have areas where we need to grow
      and learn, so we should always be open to the fact that we don’t have
      all the answers.
         In the case of fools, as seen in this proverb, the reason to be con-
      cerned is that the influence of their folly will go beyond themselves.
      They are now more convinced than ever of their wisdom; they will
      therefore repeat their folly. They may even be so convincing that others
      will think they are wise, will honor them, and consult them for advice,
      which can lead to big problems (Prov. 26:8). Folly will spread, but
      labeled as “wisdom,” it can be that much more damaging. Furthermore,
      fools are so foolish that they are not aware of their folly.

       How often are you tempted to compromise on what you know are
       core values, core truths? What happens, however, when certain
       core values collide? How can we know which ones trump the
       others?

     The Sluggard
        “The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he is too lazy to bring
     it back to his mouth” (Prov. 26:15, NIV).

       Just as with students who spend more time and energy preparing to
     cheat on an exam than studying for it, it is ironic that lazy people work
     hard to find excuses for their laziness!

Read Proverbs 26:13–16. What are we being warned about here?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        The lazy person may be right: “There is a lion in the road!” (Prov.
     26:13, NKJV). Therefore, it is wiser to stay at home and not to confront
     the danger. But by doing just that, we miss all the opportunities that life
     offers. We will never enjoy the beauty of the rose if we do not run the
     risk of being hurt by its thorns. We will not be able to move forward
     if we are afraid of obstacles. People who do not dare to commit them-
     selves will never taste the fullness of life.
        Look at some of the other imagery in those verses. Just as the door
     swings on its hinges but doesn’t go anywhere, lazy people turn in their
     beds; that is, they just change position, but don’t go anywhere, either.
        The other image, in verse 15, is even more startling. They can get
     their hands into a dish of food but are too lazy to bring them back to
     feed themselves.
        But even worse is their intellectual laziness, their closed-mindedness
     and certainty about their own positions. Therefore, they will always be
     right, wiser than seven wise men (vs. 16), and will not be open to other
     views, perhaps wiser than their own. Those who think they have all the
     answers usually don’t.

      “In the judgment men will not be condemned because they con-
      scientiously believed a lie, but because they did not believe the
      truth, because they neglected the opportunity of learning what
      is truth.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 55. How
      do we understand our role in giving others the “opportunity” to
      learn what is truth? Where does our responsibility begin, and
      where does it end?




                                                                             83

     The Friend as Enemy
        If we are more disappointed by our friends than by our enemies, it is
     because we expect good from our friends and evil from our enemies. It
     doesn’t always work out that way, though, does it? That’s why Proverbs
     warns us that sometimes a friend behaves like an enemy, and an enemy
     like a friend.

Read Proverbs 27:5, 6. When can rebuke be a sign of love?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Love is not just about kisses and sweet words. Love will sometimes
     oblige us to rebuke our friend or our child, and it can run the risk of
     appearing unpleasant, judgmental, and critical. We might even lose
     friends if we speak out. Yet if we do not warn our friends about what
     they are doing, especially if it will bring them harm, then what kind of
     friend are we?
        Open rebuke is also a sign that our love is not built on illusion and
     pretension, but is based on truth and on trust.


Read Proverbs 27:17. What can be the effect of confrontation between
     friends?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       The image of iron sharpening iron suggests a reciprocal benefit.
     Friendship tested by true confrontation will improve not only the
     quality of the friendship but also stimulate and strengthen both per-
     sonalities. The respective weapons will gain in efficiency. We will end
     up more equipped for our future struggles. People who take refuge in
     themselves and their own ideas only, and never confront the challenge
     of different views, will not grow in knowledge or in character.

      Have you ever been rebuked for something that could have really
      hurt you? Suppose you hadn’t been warned about it? Keeping
      this in mind, if you need to do the same for someone else, how can
      you do it in a redemptive manner, rather than in a judgmental
      and critical way?

     The Enemy as Friend
Read Proverbs 26:17–23. On the lines below, summarize what is being
     said.
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Proverbs, again, gets into the power of words, this time dealing with
     the harm caused by slander and quarreling. Those who slander your
     enemy before your face, to make you think they’re on your side, are
     really like “charcoal”: they feed the quarrel and lead you into the fire
     of more troubles (vs. 21, NKJV).
        Likewise “fervent lips,” which sound so eloquent, can hide a “wicked
     heart” (vs. 23, NKJV). The politician who wants to be elected, the sales-
     man who wants to sell his wares, the playboy who wants to seduce a
     woman—all of them know about the power of eloquence.
        This passage’s lesson is that we should be careful not to believe in
     every nice speech we hear. They can be dangerous precisely because
     they are nice. Some people are very good speakers; they can sound
     so persuasive, so sincere, and so caring, when inside, something
     completely different is going on. Though we have all been victims
     of people like this, who hasn’t at some point been guilty of doing the
     same thing: saying one thing to a person but thinking or feeling some-
     thing completely different? Proverbs, here, speaks strongly against this
     deceptiveness.
        “Everything that Christians do should be as transparent as the sun-
     light. Truth is of God; deception, in every one of its myriad forms, is of
     Satan. . . . It is not a light or an easy thing to speak the exact truth. We
     cannot speak the truth unless we know the truth, and how often precon-
     ceived opinions, mental bias, imperfect knowledge, errors of judgment,
     prevent a right understanding of matters with which we have to do! We
     cannot speak the truth unless our minds are continually guided by Him
     who is truth.”—Ellen G. White, Reflecting Christ, p. 71.

      How open and transparent are you in what you say? How much
      of a disconnect, if any, is there between your words and your
      thoughts? Do you really think that such duplicity can be main-
      tained indefinitely? (See Matt. 10:26, 27.)




                                                                              85

Further Study: “The agency of the Spirit of God does not remove from
     us the necessity of exercising our faculties and talents, but teaches us
     how to use every power to the glory of God. The human faculties, when
     under the special direction of the grace of God, are capable of being used
     to the best purpose on earth. Ignorance does not increase the humility or
     spirituality of any professed follower of Christ. The truths of the divine
     word can be best appreciated by an intellectual Christian. Christ can be
     best glorified by those who serve Him intelligently. The great object of
     education is to enable us to use the power which God has given us in
     such a manner as to represent the religion of the Bible and promote the
     glory of God.
        “We are indebted to Him who gave us existence, for the talents that
     have been entrusted to us, and it is a duty we owe our Creator to culti-
     vate and improve these talents.”—Ellen G. White, Counsels to Parents,
     Teachers, and Students, pp. 361, 362.

Discussion Questions:
       Discuss more about the mysteries that we find in everyday life,
      whether in nature, in human interactions, or in questions about
      faith and the nature of God and salvation. It’s one of the great
      ironies of life that the more we learn, the more we realize how little
      we know. Why is that even more true when it comes to spiritual
      truths?

       What are some “truths” that are, indeed, relative, cultural,
      and changing? How do we distinguish them from truths that are
      eternal, universal, and immutable? Why is it so important that
      we know the difference between them? Why is the confusion of
      contingent truths with eternal truths one of the great dangers we
      face?

       It has been said that smart people keep their friends close and
      their enemies closer. What does that mean? As Christians, how are
      we to relate to such a sentiment? In what way can Matthew 10:16
      help?

Opening “a Lot More Doors”
   In Bridgeport, West Virginia, the only Seventh-day Adventist church
in Harrison County meets each Sabbath in the local Presbyterian church.
Although they don’t have their own building yet, members of the Central
Hills Seventh-day Adventist Church are certainly building relationships.
   In response to the Discover Bible School mailings, the Central Hills
church has received more than 300 requests for Bible studies just from
within Harrison County. Pastor James Volpe and his 30 church mem-
bers are doing their best to keep up. Some of the most active members
include Angela, 21, Heather, 20, and Lee, 22.
   “We were driving from house to house,” remembers Heather, “handing
out the first two lessons, and asking people if they wanted to have per-
sonal visits or continue the lessons through the mail. One of the ladies
we met requested that we return so Angela and I decided that we would
do it. We studied with her every week.
   “That winter, her son committed suicide. We quit doing Bible stud-
ies, but we’d still visit her. We helped her around Thanksgiving and
Christmas. Sometimes she comes to church.” Heather and Angela have
since resumed the Bible studies with this student.
   While Lee doesn’t give personal Bible studies, he jumped in and orga-
nized the mailings. “I make sure the completed lessons get graded and
sent back so that person can start on the next lesson. If a month goes
by and we haven’t heard from the Bible student, then we follow up and
make sure that we keep in contact with them.”
   While the members of the Central Hills church have been supportive,
the church’s young people have especially enjoyed being involved.
   “Our youth group has gotten a lot stronger,” says Angela. “I’ve always
liked to be involved in some way; I just didn’t know how.”
   “I think this is one of the first times we could put into practice all of
the stuff we hear every week, we could actually be a part of something
and watch the church grow,” adds Lee.
   Heather believes that giving personal Bible studies is one of the best
methods for church growth and spiritual commitment. “All of the youth
were together, delivering the lessons. Then once Angela and I started
giving Bible studies, I enjoyed it. It made me grow spiritually.
   “We had an [evangelistic] seminar coming to the area, but by us doing
the Bible studies and getting out—that helped our church to grow. It
opens a lot more doors.”

      Gal. 3:24; Prov. 28:5; 1 John 2:15–17; Prov. 29:13.

Memory Text: “The fear of man brings a snare, but whoever trusts in

      S
            o many voices call to us from so many directions. How do people
            know what is right and what is wrong? The answer is found in
            God and His written revelation. We must learn to rely on God and
      to obey His Law. The rest then will follow by itself.
        Jesus told us this when He said to “ ‘seek first the kingdom of God,’ ”
      and then all that we need will be supplied (Matt. 6:33, NKJV). We
      are to make trusting and following God our first priority; otherwise,
      we will make something else that priority, which is idolatry, pure and
      simple. And we can learn to trust God only by living a life of faith. The
      Christian walk is just that, a walk; we have to make the choices to do the
      things that the Lord has told us to do, and then leave the consequences
      to Him.

     Keep the Law
       Out of 13 occurrences of the word torah—“law” or “teaching”—in
     the book of Proverbs, four are in Proverbs 28 (vss. 4 [twice], 7, 9).
     Although this use in Proverbs applies normally to the “teaching” of the
     wise man (Prov. 13:14), in the Israelite tradition the word has a spiritual
     connotation and refers to divine revelation, as attested in the book of
     Proverbs itself (Prov. 29:18).

Read Proverbs 28:4, 7, and 9. What do these verses tell us about the
     importance of the law in how we live?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        What made the people of Israel different from other nations was not
     so much their way of thinking, or even their “spiritual” and abstract
     theological views. It was their concrete choices in life about, among
     other things, food, rest, the natural environment, and their relationships
     with neighbors and family that made them “holy,” or “set apart” from
     all the other nations. And, ideally, those choices were to center on the
     law and the principles found in it.
        After all, we humans cannot be wise by ourselves; we can’t always
     even distinguish between good and evil (1 Kings 3:9). So, we need the
     divine law to help us to acquire discernment. In other words, the acqui-
     sition of wisdom does not depend on intellectual or spiritual exercises;
     it is essentially related to obedience to a law that lies outside ourselves,
     our culture, our personal psychology, and our desires.
        This law is, of course, God’s eternal law. And to follow that law is
     indeed an act of faith. “For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ:
     for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to
     the Jew first, and also to the Greek. For therein is the righteousness of
     God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by
     faith” (Rom. 1:16, 17).

      What troubles and problems have you been spared because you
      have made a commitment by faith to keep God’s law? How dif-
      ferent would your life be were you not keeping it?




                                                                              89

      Seek the Lord
        No matter how crucial it is to a life of faith, the law (the torah) is
      not itself the source of life. On the contrary, the law points out sin, and
      sin leads to death (see Rom. 7:7–13). Instead, what makes the torah
      effective is that it comes from God. Apart from God, the torah would
      be a legalistic creed that has nothing to do with His original intention.
      A life of obedience to the law of God is related to a life with God. The
      torah does not replace God; it is just a teacher that (according to Paul’s
      analogy) leads the students to their Master (Gal. 3:24).

Read Galatians 3:24 in context. How does the law point us to Jesus, so
      that we can indeed be “justified by faith”?

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         The book of Proverbs is not just a book of wisdom; it is, first of all,
      a book about the God who has revealed wisdom. Seeking wisdom by
      obeying the law will draw us nearer to the Lord and to the salvation He
      freely offers us by faith in Jesus.

Read Proverbs 28:5. What is the key for us to “understand all”?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         The word understand is used twice in verse 5, just as the word law is
      in verse 4. The two verses are related: keeping the law (vs. 4) and seek-
      ing the Lord (vs. 5) belong together. The scope of this activity, however,
      is not just knowing and doing what is right (“justice” [vs. 5, NKJV]).
      This understanding concerns “all” simply because it derives from the
      God of “all.” For ancient Israel, knowledge of all things was not sepa-
      rated from religious experience. Faith was closely tied to intelligence
      and rational understanding. It was inconceivable to have faith without
      thinking or thinking without faith, because God was the foundation of
      both domains.

       Why is faith in God such a rational position to hold? Why is
       it more illogical and irrational to reject God than to believe in
       Him?

     Words for the Rich
Read 1 John 2:15–17. What are we being warned against here, and
     how can we protect ourselves from the danger these verses talk
     about?

     _________________________________________________________

        Though the idea of what it means to be “rich” varies greatly, the book
     of Proverbs comes with some instructions on how to get “rich” and then
     how to deal with your “riches” once you get them.
        1. Do not get rich at the expense of the poor (Prov. 28:8). Your wealth
     is not justified if you obtain it at the expense of the poor. As we have
     already seen, the Bible speaks very strongly against those who exploit
     the poor for their own gain.
        2. Give to the poor (Prov. 28:27). In contrast to the “greedy” of
     Proverbs 28:25 (NIV, literally, “broad of soul/appetite”), the person who
     is generous to the poor will be blessed.
        3. Work hard (Prov. 28:19). Wealth should not come as the result of
     stealing or by chance, but as a reward for our hard work. What is obtained
     depends on the quality of our labor. If we are rich, we should deserve it.
        4. Do not try to get rich fast (Prov. 28:20, 22). Our proverbs present
     two potential scenarios: (1) when we close an eye to some dishonest
     action and, as a result, become complicit in that action (vs. 22); (2)
     when we are so eager to enjoy the wealth of our parents that we rob
     them of what they need to live now (vs. 24). Even worse, those who do
     those things can justify the wrong deeds in their own minds until they
     convince themselves that they have done nothing wrong. Therefore,
     they say, “it is no transgression” (NKJV).

      Money is a very powerful force in this world, which is why the
      Bible talks a lot about it. If, like pretty much everyone else, you
      desire money, how can you make sure that you are not falling
      into the trap of what Jesus called “the deceitfulness of riches”
      (Mark 4:19)?

     Handbook for the Poor
Read Proverbs 29:13. What is being discussed here?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        The poor and the rich are equal (Prov. 29:13, NKJV). The image of
     light used in this proverb places this issue in perspective of Creation.
     Both the rich and the poor have been created by God (Prov. 22:2). They
     both enjoy the gift of life, and the sun shines upon both. Just as the rich
     have been warned about how they treat the poor, the poor are to love even
     their oppressors, which could in some cases be the rich (Matt. 5:44, 45).

What is the message of Proverbs 28:3?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        The poor have the same duties as the rich (Prov. 28:3). Poverty should
     not be an excuse for iniquity. The fact that you may have been oppressed
     does not give you license to oppress others. Jesus’ parable of the unfor-
     giving servant who oppresses the one poorer than himself shows that this
     reaction, although unexpected on the part of the poor (whom one might
     think would be more sympathetic to other poor people), is not unusual
     (Matt. 18:22–35). In Proverbs 28:3, the image of the rain, which usually
     is a blessing, turns out to be a destructive torrent; this imagery illustrates
     the abnormality of that behavior and the disappointment it brings.

What is the message of Proverbs 28:6?
     _________________________________________________________

         The righteous poor are better than the wicked rich (Prov. 28:6).
     According to traditional wisdom, the righteous person is not supposed
     to be poor, for poverty is supposedly the just punishment for the lazy
     (Prov. 24:34). Yet, the reality of life is more complex. The poor may be
     the victims of injustice or of circumstances beyond their control. This can
     often be the case. Nevertheless, the scale of values defended by the book
     of Proverbs is clear and unambiguous. Righteousness is more important
     than riches, and success is not a foolproof indicator of righteousness.

      What can we do when tempted to compromise our values for
      material gain? How can we protect ourselves from doing some-
      thing like this, which is easier to do than we realize?

      Loving the Truth
        Of all the things we could teach our children, our students, or anyone
      who is open to learning from us, perhaps the most important lesson can
      be found here in 2 Thessalonians, as Paul, who is writing about the lost,
      says that “they received not the love of the truth” (vs. 10). Of course,
      because Jesus is the Truth, teaching others to love truth is teaching
      them to love Jesus, and what else really matters?
         “Whatever line of investigation we pursue, with a sincere purpose
      to arrive at truth, we are brought in touch with the unseen, mighty
      Intelligence that is working in and through all. The mind of man is
      brought into communion with the mind of God, the finite with the
      Infinite. The effect of such communion on body and mind and soul is
      beyond estimate.”—Ellen G. White, Education, p. 14.

Read Proverbs 29:15 (see also vs. 19). What important principle is seen
      here, not just in education but in life in general?

      can’t reprove or punish—in some cases more is needed. This is espe-
      cially true with our children. At times children need to be punished in
      order to be brought into line.
         Our natures are all fallen and corrupt, and this includes even those ador-
      able little beings whom we love, our children. We don’t do our children or
      ourselves any favors by letting them do whatever they want. Children, in
      fact, not only need discipline—they want it. They need to know that bound-
      aries exist, and that they need to stay within them. A mother who believes
      that she has to respect her children’s freedom and lets them do whatever
      they want without ever saying No to them, will ultimately bring “shame”
      (vs. 15) to herself and, no doubt, sorrow to the children—if not now, then
      certainly when the children become adults.

       What are some of the lessons you learned as a child that have
       stuck with you as an adult? How has that knowledge helped to
       make your life better now?

Further Study: “The laws of God have their foundation in the most im-
     mutable rectitude, and are so framed that they will promote the happiness
     of those who keep them. . . . Religion brings man into personal relation
     with God, but not exclusively; for the principles of heaven are to be lived
     out, that they may help and bless humanity.”—Ellen G. White, Sons and
     Daughters of God, p. 267.
       “The utter neglect of training children for God has perpetuated evil
     and thrown into the ranks of the enemy many who with judicious care
     might have been co-laborers with Christ. False ideas and a foolish,
     misdirected affection have nurtured traits which have made the children
     unlovely and unhappy, have embittered the lives of the parents, and
     have extended their baleful influence from generation to generation.
     Any child that is permitted to have his own way will dishonor God and
     bring his father and mother to shame. . . . By neglecting their duty and
     indulging their children in wrong, parents close to them the gates of
     the city of God.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5,
     pp. 325, 326.

Discussion Questions:
       Russian author Leo Tolstoy, though raised in a Christian
      home, abandoned his faith for many years. When older, he faced
      a crisis: What did life mean, especially a life that will certainly end
      in death? Though he sought answers in all areas of knowledge,
      he found none there. He eventually realized that the only logical
      answer to the question of life and its meaning had to be found in
      faith—in something that went beyond logic itself. That is, his logic
      told him to step beyond logic, into the world of faith, in order to
      get answers to the meaning of life. Why, then, is faith in Jesus
      really the most logical choice we can make regarding the meaning
      and purpose of life?

       What is your understanding of what it means to love the truth?
      How do we love truth? To love truth, of course, would mean that
      we would have to know it first. How do we come to a knowledge
      of truth? And how can we be sure that we don’t allow anything to
      stand in the way of our loving truth above all else?

                                                    Story
Kindness Always Comes Back
   Miranda Starr, principal and teacher at Parkersburg Academy in West
Virginia, wanted to do an experiment with her first- and second-grade
students.
   “In Bible class, we were studying about kindness, and how it is conta-
gious,” she says. “We wanted to see if it really works.”
   Then Miranda had an idea; why not go to Eagle Pointe, a local nursing
home, where the students could practice their reading skills and make
friends with the residents? “This was something I had always wanted to
do,” she admits. “We like to sing, but [I wondered] what else could we
do for them to make relationships.”
   The idea was a hit, and by January the students were reading well
enough to read on their own.
   “We go to Eagle Pointe every other Friday,” explains eight-year-old
Ben. “We sing to the whole group, and we read to our partners.”
   “It wasn’t hard to pick our partners,” chimes in seven-year-old Reagan.
“We saw them, looked at their faces, and then chose one because we
liked them!”
   The students also get to choose the book or books that they want to
read to their partner and are welcome to exchange books with other
students if they finish their own.
   As the students read, they are also developing friendships. “My part-
ner’s name is Miss Jane,” says six-year-old Sophia. “I was reading about
animal tracks, and I read about a red fox. She told me that she once had
a red fox as a pet!”
   The residents clearly enjoy the visits and comment on what good read-
ers the students are. “I like seeing my partner smile,” Ben adds.
   The students in grades three through eight also participate. “I really
like going there,” says nine-year-old Ryleigh. “There’s one man I read
to—Mark. He’s always happy to see me, and says, ‘God loves you.’ I
really like him and wish we could go more often.”
   In appreciation of the students’ visits, Eagle Pointe held a banquet
in their honor and presented Miranda with an award plaque: “Junior
Volunteers of the Year—Parkersburg Academy. You’ve warmed the
hearts of many by the caring that you show. Volunteers are Shining
Stars.”
   Reflecting on their kindness experiment, Miranda knows it was a suc-
cess. “Kindness did come back. We tried to give them joy, but they gave
more to us.”

      The Humility of the Wise




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Proverbs 30, Luke 18:9–14, Job
      38–40:2, 1 John 1:9, Rev. 3:14–18, Ps. 104:24.

Memory Text: “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom
       of heaven” (Matthew 5:3, NKJV).



      I
          n the Bible, humility is considered an important virtue. The greatest
          of prophets, Moses, is singled out as the most humble person who
          ever lived (Num. 12:3, NKJV). According to Micah 6:8, the main
      duty that God expects from people is “to walk humbly with your God”
      (NKJV). Jesus, too, insists that humility is an ideal that the Christian
      should adopt: “ ‘Whoever humbles himself as this little child is the
      greatest in the kingdom of heaven’ ” (Matt. 18:4, NKJV).
         After all, what does anyone have to boast about? Every breath, every
      heartbeat, every gift, every talent, comes only from God, in whom “we
      live, and move, and have our being” (Acts 17:28). And in light of the
      cross, even all our righteousness is as “filthy rags” (Isa. 64:6); how,
      then, can we boast?
         This week Proverbs looks at humility; considering our situation, how
      foolish is it to be anything but humble?

     Who Do You Think You Are?
Read Proverbs 30:1–3, 32, 33. Together, what are they saying?

       The self-negation seen in these texts is quite a break from the usual
     self-exaltation of kings in the ancient Near East, who often liked to
     boast of their wisdom, achievements, and military victories. Solomon
     himself is recorded as surpassing “all the kings of the earth in riches
     and wisdom” (1 Kings 10:23, NKJV; Eccles. 2:9). And then, of course,
     there’s Nebuchadnezzar, who proclaimed: “ ‘Is not this the great
     Babylon I have built as the royal residence, by my mighty power and
     for the glory of my majesty?’ ” (Dan. 4:30, NIV).
       Because our author understands his own ignorance, he calls boast-
     ing “foolish.” The Hebrew word for “foolish” here is nabal, which is
     the name of Nabal, whose behavior exemplified foolish pride, as well
     (1 Samuel 25). Such boasting, which implies pride, also carries the
     potential for humiliation and thus, for anger and strife. The apostle
     Paul also called some of his church members “fools” who considered
     themselves wise and were, even worse, boasting about it (2 Cor.
     11:18, 19).

Read Luke 18:9–14. Why might it be easier to be like the Pharisee
     than one might think? How can we make sure that we don’t fall
     into this same trap even in the subtlest ways?

       You have to feel sorry for people who boast (usually it’s a cover for
     insecurities, anyway); it shows just how self-deceived and foolish they
     really are.
                                                                         97

     A Knowledge of God?
       Pride arises in those who don’t know the Lord in a personal way. In
     contrast, the person who lives in communion with God will be humble,
     for he or she is constantly in touch with the One who is infinitely
     greater than any of us. When we think about the size of the universe
     and realize that we are worshiping the One who created that universe,
     and that this same God suffered in the person of Jesus on the cross for
     us—it’s hard to imagine how we could struggle with pride while keep-
     ing these thoughts before us.

Read Proverbs 30:3–6. What do these verses tell us about the power,
      majesty, and mystery of God?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       The expression “knowledge of God” is to be understood as meaning
     “knowledge about God.” Five rhetorical questions are then asked, which
     force us to recognize just how much about God we really don’t understand.

Read those questions in Proverbs 30:4. What challenge do they present
      to us?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       Because God is the Creator (the first four questions), He remains far
     beyond our understanding (the fifth question). In the book of Job, God
     challenges Job with the same questions so that Job would realize that
     he could not comprehend God or His ways (Job 38–40:2).
       The fact that God is the Creator, and that we cannot fully understand
     Him, gives us a crucial lesson regarding how we should receive His
     written revelation, which scholars are always questioning. Who are
     we—whose understanding of even the simplest things in nature is
     clouded and full of mystery—to challenge the Word of God, even the
     parts that baffle or disturb us?

       Dwell on the grandeur and mystery of the creation itself. What
       should these tell us about the grandeur and mystery of the Creator?
       Why should this grandeur and mystery give us comfort and hope?

     Neither Too Much nor Too Little
        Proverbs 30:7–9 contains the only prayer in the book of Proverbs. It
     is not by chance that this request immediately follows the affirmation
     of God as the great Creator (Prov. 30:4) and the promise of His faith-
     fulness (vs. 5).

Read Proverbs 30:7–9. Why would someone ask these things?
     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Before we ask God for anything, it is important to make sure our
     relationship with Him is solid. If we lie, then we act as if God, who
     knows all things, doesn’t even exist. This is why the confession of
     our sin is a prerequisite for forgiveness (1 John 1:9). We cannot cheat
     God; He sees us exactly as we are. As we pray, the dramatic gesture of
     prostration, lying in the dust like the dead (Lam. 3:29), reveals not only
     our reverence and humility, but shows an awareness of our spiritual
     nakedness before Him.
        In Proverbs 30:8, the writer asks God to “give” neither poverty nor
     riches. The first time that the verb “give” is used in the Bible in relation
     to humans, it deals with God’s gift of food (Gen. 1:29). This is why in
     many cultures food is traditionally associated with prayer. This basic
     need, which makes us so dependent on the God of Creation, places the
     experience of prayer at the core of our survival.
        The two requests do not aim just at the balance of human character.
     They converge in one goal: the glory of God. If we get too little, we
     tend to steal and insult God; if we get too much, we do not feel the need
     for God and may even deny His existence. It is noteworthy, however,
     that only the latter predicament can lead to a disconnect from God; the
     former will likely keep us in touch with Him.
        The Lord’s Prayer carries the same twofold concern: (1) “Give us this
     day our daily bread” (Matt. 6:11) provides for our needs and not more;
     and (2) “ ‘Do not lead us into temptation’ ” (vs. 13, NKJV) takes care
     of our needs.

      Think about just how dependent you are on God. How can keep-
      ing that stark fact ever in your mind help you grow in faith?
      What dangers come when we forget this dependence?




                                                                              99

      The Actions of the Arrogant
         Just as humility is positive and brings blessings, a lack of humility
      is dangerous and brings curses. After having encouraged the virtue of
      humility by showing its rewards and fruit, Proverbs 30 gives a stern
      warning about the dangers that come from pride.
         Cursing your parents (Prov. 30:11, 17). Agur begins with this cat-
      egory, for it represents the most serious act of arrogance, when children
      despise their source of life. Significantly, honoring and blessing one’s
      parents is the only commandment associated with the promise of life
      (Exod. 20:12; Eph. 6:2, 3), while the death penalty is prescribed for its
      transgression (Exod. 21:15, 17).
         Self-righteousness (Prov. 30:12, 20). The condition of sinners who
      think of themselves as righteous is bad, because they will stay in their
      sin, believing that they are pure and don’t need forgiveness. This is
      why the confession of sin is so fundamental to obtaining forgiveness
      (1 John 1:9). The Laodiceans, who claim that they are rich, intelligent,
      and well dressed (though unaware that they are poor, blind, and naked),
      are counseled to acquire from God the means to repair their miserable
      condition (Rev. 3:14–18).
         “Here is represented a people who pride themselves in their pos-
      session of spiritual knowledge and advantages. But they have not
      responded to the unmerited blessings that God has bestowed upon
      them. They have been full of rebellion, ingratitude, and forgetfulness
      of God; and still He has dealt with them as a loving, forgiving father
      deals with an ungrateful, wayward son. They have resisted His grace,
      abused His privileges, slighted His opportunities, and have been satis-
      fied to sink down in contentment, in lamentable ingratitude, hollow
      formalism, and hypocritical insincerity.”—Ellen G. White, Faith and
      Works, p. 83.
         Contempt (Prov. 30:13, 14). The picture presented of the arrogant is
      not pretty. Though they have a proud look on their face, the arrogance
      doesn’t remain just there: it is manifested in the contempt they reveal
      to those who they feel are below them. The imagery of the “fangs” and
      “teeth” (vs. 14, NKJV) show just how bad their actions are.

       Think about how you have treated others, particularly those to
       whom you might even feel superior (most of us have those feel-
       ings at times, do we not?). How can you make it right? How can
       you display the humility needed to make it right?

      Lessons From Nature
        All through the Bible, imagery from nature has been used to teach
      spiritual truths. Here, too, using nature, the proverb teaches us lessons
      about humility.

Read Proverbs 30:18, 19. What is it saying here, too, about the limits
      of human understanding?

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        Agur sees mystery in even many of the “common” things. It is a very
      fascinating mix of mysteries that he presents here. The first two are
      from animals: an eagle silently moving through the sky, a snake silently
      moving along the earth. He then shifts to two human actions: a ship on
      the sea, and a man with a woman. Even today, with all our scientific
      knowledge, so many mysteries remain. How crucial it is that we never
      lose our appreciation for the depth and majesty of life. That attitude
      will surely help keep us humble before God.

Read Proverbs 30:24–28. What other mysteries from nature catch the
      author’s attention and awe?

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        It’s interesting that the immediately preceding verses (Prov. 30:20–23)
      deal with human folly, arrogance, and vice. He then shifts to the animal
      world, pointing to small and humble creatures, even though he uses
      the same Hebrew word for “wise” in reference to them that is used in
      reference to humans (Prov. 3:13) and even God Himself (Job 12:13,
      Ps. 104:24). Even today, with all our advances in science, how these
      creatures do what they do remains beyond our full comprehension. How
      much more so their actions must have baffled this wise man in his time.
      And he was indeed wise, because one of the great signs of wisdom is to
      acknowledge just how little we know, even about the commonest things.

       Think about some of the “simplest” things in nature: the leaf of
       a tree, a drop of water, a seashell. How should the fact that even
       these things are full of mysteries keep us humble?
                                                                          101

Further Study: “We should reverence God’s word. For the printed
      volume we should show respect, never putting it to common uses, or
      handling it carelessly. And never should Scripture be quoted in a jest,
      or paraphrased to point a witty saying. ‘Every word of God is pure’; ‘as
      silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.’ Proverbs 30:5;
      Psalm 12:6.”—Ellen G. White, Education, p. 244.
         “Christ’s first words to the people on the mount were words of bless-
      ing. Happy are they, He said, who recognize their spiritual poverty, and
      feel their need of redemption. The gospel is to be preached to the poor.
      Not to the spiritually proud, those who claim to be rich and in need of
      nothing, is it revealed, but to those who are humble and contrite. . . . The
      Lord can do nothing toward the recovery of man until, convinced of his
      own weakness, and stripped of all self-sufficiency, he yields himself to
      the control of God. Then he can receive the gift that God is waiting to
      bestow. From the soul that feels his need, nothing is withheld. He has
      unrestricted access to Him in whom all fullness dwells.”—Ellen G.
      White, The Desire of Ages, pp. 299, 300.

Discussion Questions:
        Dwell on the plan of salvation and what was required to save
       us. That is, we are so fallen, so corrupt, so evil, that mere regenera-
       tion would not be enough to redeem us from sin. No matter how
       much we are changed and restored, that regeneration and resto-
       ration cannot save us. We need a substitute, someone who legally
       stands in our place and whose righteousness alone is enough to
       make us right with God. What should this reality itself tell us
       about why arrogance and pride have to be some of the worst sins
       in fallen beings like us?

        What are some of the different ways that our very existence
       depends upon God? What are the things in nature itself that show
       us how God sustains our existence?

        Dwell more on the prayer in Proverbs 30:7–9. Look at the bal-
       ance there. How do we find balance in all that we do? Why is this
       so important?

Thrice Saved
   At the age of four, Jesse lost his mother. By the time he was nine, Jesse
lived in foster homes. As a teen, he met a young man who played bas-
ketball. When Jesse shared his name, the young man looked surprised.
“Your mother and my father were brother and sister!”
   Taking Jesse home, the cousin introduced him to the rest of the fam-
ily. That’s when Jesse learned that his mother had died of complications
caused by his father’s beatings.
   Jesse moved in with his uncle; and as his anger over his circum-
stances simmered, he joined the U.S. Air National Guard then switched
to the U.S. Marines. He married, had three children, but later divorced.
“I felt hurt and empty inside,” he recalled. “Once more I had no family
and felt completely alone.”
   Feeling life wasn’t worth living, Jesse took his rifle and ammunition
down to the beach with plans to end his life. Wading into the sea, he
sat down on a rock. Soon a police officer came, but Jesse raised his
rifle, warning him to stay away. Then the colonel from the Marine base
arrived, ordering him to put the gun down. Jesse refused. But when he
saw his father approaching, Jesse put the gun into his mouth and pulled
the trigger. There was an explosion and he fell backward—still alive.
The bullet had jammed halfway through the barrel.
   Jesse was discharged from the Marines and tried again to commit
suicide. This time he ended up in the hospital emergency room where
he met Dr. Nozaki, a Seventh-day Adventist physician determined to
save him. When he awoke after surgery, Jesse found a Bible by his bed,
placed there by Dr. Nozaki. He hid the Bible, but each day he found
another one.
   When Jesse was released from the hospital, Dr. Nozaki urged him to
read the book of John. Finally, Jesse agreed. The doctor called him each
day, making sure that he had food and clothing. In time, Jesse realized
that Dr. Nozaki really cared, and he learned to trust him. He started Bible
studies, and the doctor invited him to church.
   One day Jesse returned to the rock where he had tried to kill himself
and thanked God for saving his life. He continued studying and was
baptized into the Seventh-day Adventist Church. “For the first time in
my life,” he said, “I felt peace.”
   Later, with the doctor’s encouragement, Jesse and his wife reconciled.
They remarried in Dr. Nozaki’s home.

      Women and Wine




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Proverbs 31, Job 29:15, Prov-
      erbs 8, 1 Cor. 1:21, Rev. 14:13.

Memory Text: “Do not give your strength to women, nor your ways to
      that which destroys kings. It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for
      kings to drink wine, nor for princes intoxicating drink” (Proverbs
      31:3, 4, NKJV).



      T
             he book of Proverbs began with the teachings of a father (Prov.
             1:1, 8; 4:1) and ends with the teachings of a mother (Prov. 31:1).
             The name Lemuel may allude to Solomon; if so, then Lemuel’s
      mother is Solomon’s mother, and she warns her son against the two
      most serious threats to the king: wine and women.
        The association of wine and women is deliberate. To be efficient as
      a ruler, the king has to be careful of the influences he faces, and these
      two factors can be very powerful. Though the right woman could be
      beneficial, alcohol is only trouble.
        The father’s introduction was concerned with the spiritual acquisition
      of wisdom. Now, the mother’s conclusion is concerned with applying
      wisdom in real life. For the spiritual principles taught by the father
      would mean nothing if the practical advice offered by the mother were
      not followed.

     A Toast “To Life”?
        In many cultures, drinking alcohol is associated with living a good
     life. People raise a glass and wish one another a long life, though the
     irony is that each glass works toward destroying life. Nicely designed
     bottles, poetic and funny drinking songs, clever commercials, and even
     some “scientific” findings all comfort drinkers in their idea that alcohol
     is good for them. Proverbs has already warned us against this deadly
     deception (Prov. 23:30–35). Now the theme reappears, showing us even
     more damage that drinking can bring.

Read Proverbs 31:4, 5, 8, 9. Together, what do they say, and how does
     their message apply to every follower of the Lord, not just the king?

     _________________________________________________________

        In similar language, Job describes himself as being “eyes to the blind,
     and . . . feet to the lame” (Job 29:15, NKJV). Likewise, the king or
     those with means should help support the poor and the needy—those
     who are “speechless” in that they don’t have a voice because no one
     listens to them.
        The destructive effect of wine can also be seen in how it can so easily
     distort one’s judgment. While alcohol is bad enough for common folk,
     for a king or someone with power, alcohol can create terrible situations.
     The drinking king not only “forgets the law” and does not know what
     is right, but he subsequently issues distorted judgments: the guilty are
     declared innocent, and the innocent guilty.
        What is at stake here is the capacity to discern between right and
     wrong, good and evil. The prohibition of wine drinking has to do with
     basic wisdom and, as such, should apply to every human being. It is
     noteworthy that this concern is precisely the reason implied in the
     special prohibition of drinking for the priest: “that you may distinguish
     between holy and unholy” (Lev. 10:9, 10, NKJV).

      Who hasn’t seen the devastating effects of alcohol in so many
      lives? How can you help others, especially the young, stay clear of
      what can bring only harm to them and to others?




                                                                          105

      A Toast “To Death”
Read Proverbs 31:6, 7. How are we to understand these texts?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         A quick reading of these verses gives the impression that Lemuel’s
      mother allows the consumption of wine or any other alcohol for the
      person who is about to die (vs. 6) or for the person who suffers from
      depression (vs. 7). This reading, however, would contradict not only the
      immediate context—Lemuel’s mother has just warned the king against
      wine drinking—but also the general context of the book of Proverbs,
      which systematically and emphatically prohibits wine drinking.
         In addition, it hardly makes sense to offer something to the perish-
      ing that would only make their health and well-being worse. And giv-
      ing alcohol to a depressed person is like giving salt to someone who
      is already dehydrated. If, as we know, God cares about our bodies
      and our health, it doesn’t make sense to see these texts, especially in
      context, encouraging the use of alcohol.
         More important, an analysis of the use of the expression “who is
      perishing” in the book of Proverbs reveals that it is speaking about
      the wicked (Prov. 10:28; 11:7, 10; 19:9; 21:28; 28:28). Through the
      expression “who is perishing,” Lemuel’s mother points in fact, by
      association, to the wicked. As for the expression “bitter of heart,”
      it refers to the depressed person (Prov. 31:6, NKJV), who, like the
      wicked, becomes insensitive and “forgets” poverty (vs. 7).
         “Satan gathered the fallen angels together to devise some way of
      doing the most possible evil to the human family. One proposition
      after another was made, till finally Satan himself thought of a plan.
      He would take the fruit of the vine, also wheat, and other things given
      by God as food, and would convert them into poisons, which would
      ruin man’s physical, mental, and moral powers, and so overcome
      the senses that Satan should have full control. Under the influence
      of liquor, men would be led to commit crimes of all kinds. Through
      perverted appetite the world would be made corrupt. By leading men
      to drink alcohol, Satan would cause them to descend lower and lower
      in the scale.”—Ellen G. White, Temperance, p. 12.

     A Virtuous Woman
       “Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above
     rubies” (Prov. 31:10).

       Who is the “virtuous woman” of Proverbs 31:10? A number of indi-
     cations suggest that the author has more in mind than a godly woman or
     the ideal wife. Following the lead of many passages of the book (Prov.
     1:20–33, 3:13–20, 4:5–9, Proverbs 8), we have good reason to think
     that “the virtuous woman” represents wisdom. This personification of
     wisdom as a woman is justified not only because the Hebrew word for
     “wisdom,” chokmah, is a feminine noun but also because it allows the
     Hebrew writer to draw all kinds of concrete lessons for our daily life.
     Wisdom is not pictured as some lofty and unreachable ideal but as a
     very practical and approachable woman who could become our life
     companion.
       This last teaching about wisdom is given through a beautiful acrostic
     poem: each verse begins with a Hebrew letter following the alphabetic
     order, as in the book of Lamentations and in many psalms.

Compare the text on wisdom in Proverbs 8 with our text on the
     “virtuous woman.” What features of the “virtuous woman” remind
     us of wisdom in the book of Proverbs?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

       1.   She is precious and worth finding (Prov. 31:10, 8:35).
       2.   Her worth is more than rubies (Prov. 31:10; 8:10, 11, 18, 19).
       3.   She provides food (Prov. 31:14, 8:19).
       4.   She is strong (Prov. 31:17, 25; 8:14).
       5.   She is wise (Prov. 31:26, 8:1).
       6.   She is praised (Prov. 31:28, 8:34).

        Though we live in the so-called information age, and though we have
     acquired so much more knowledge than had previous generations, there’s
     little to indicate that our generation is any wiser than previous genera-
     tions. Indeed, as Martin Luther King Jr. said, “We have guided missiles
     and misguided men.”

      Read 1 Corinthians 1:21. What does it say to you, and how can
      this idea help you live by faith?


                                                                         107

      She Works
         The virtuous woman in Proverbs 31 is not lazy; she works hard and
      is very active. The poem insists on this quality (Prov. 31:27), which
      characterizes the wise versus the fool (Prov. 6:6; 24:33, 34). The field
      of her activities is comprehensive and concrete. To be spiritual does not
      mean that we should be idle, all under the pretext that we are concerned
      with highly important religious issues, and thus do not have time to
      take care of “trivial” matters. (See Luke 16:10.) The woman “willingly
      works with her hands” (Prov. 31:13, NKJV). It is interesting that this
      very spiritual person is never depicted praying or meditating. She is
      shown only as an efficient and productive woman, like Martha of the
      Gospels (Luke 10:38–40).

Read Proverbs 31:12, 15, 18. Why is the woman always working?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

        The woman works “all the days of her life” (vs. 12), even during the
      night (vs. 15, 18). Her active and watchful presence is effective all the
      time. The reason for her constant attention is her responsibility.

Read Proverbs 31:20, 25. What is the temporal scope of her projects?
      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

      _________________________________________________________

         Here we touch on an important point regarding our work and effort:
      it will be tested by time. Only the future will testify to the quality of
      our deeds. To work wisely is to work with the future in mind, not just
      for an immediate reward.
         Though not quite dealing with the same thing, the principle in the fol-
      lowing text from Revelation is so important: “Blessed are the dead which
      die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest
      from their labours; and their works do follow them” (Rev. 14:13).

       If you have a special woman (a wife, mother, family member,
       teacher, boss, or friend) in your life, what can you do to show
       your appreciation for her and for all she has done for you?

     She Cares
Read Proverbs 31:26–31. What other important characteristics are
     seen in this woman? Why are these important for all of us, regard-
     less of who we are?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        As we have seen all through this quarter, an emphasis is placed on
     words, on what we say. The woman is known for her wisdom and for
     her kindness. They are related. After all, couldn’t one argue that kind-
     ness is another form of wisdom, especially when we understand that
     wisdom isn’t just what we know but what we say and do?
        Notice, too, the phrase the “law of kindness.” That is, kindness isn’t
     just some fleeting attribute that escapes from her mouth now and then.
     It is a law, a principle of her very existence. How powerful it would be
     if the “law of kindness” were to guide all that came out of our mouths.

Read Proverbs 31:30. What important point is revealed here that is so
     often forgotten?

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        All too often women are rated only in terms of outward appearance;
     that’s such a shallow and superficial marker. The Bible points out just
     how “vain,” how empty, that kind of attitude ultimately is. This woman’s
     true beauty is found in her character and how that character is made
     manifest in her life and works. Beauty will always pass away; character
     can endure forever. “A great name among men is as letters traced in
     sand, but a spotless character will endure to all eternity.”—Ellen G.
     White, God’s Amazing Grace, p. 81.

      In what areas of your life do you need to see your character
      improve? Praying about it is fine, but what concrete positive
      steps must you take in order to see growth?

      Further Study: “When indulging their appetite for wine and
      while under its exciting stimulus, their reason was clouded, and they
      could not discern the difference between the sacred and the common.
      Contrary to God’s express direction, they dishonored Him by offering
      common instead of sacred fire. God visited them with His wrath; fire
      went forth from His presence and destroyed them.”—Ellen G. White,
      Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3, p. 295.
         “Let the children and youth learn from the Bible how God has hon-
      ored the work of the everyday toiler. . . . Let them read . . . of the
      wise woman described in the Proverbs, who ‘seeketh wool and flax,
      and worketh willingly with her hands;’ who ‘giveth meat to her house-
      hold, and their task to her maidens;’ who ‘planteth a vineyard,’ ‘and
      strengtheneth her arms;’ who ‘stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea,
      . . . reacheth forth her hands to the needy;’ who ‘looketh well to the
      ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.’ Proverbs
      31:13, 15, R.V.; 31:16, 17, 20, 27.”—Ellen G. White, Education, p. 217.

Discussion Questions:
        Why is total abstinence from alcohol the only right option?
       After all, what possible good can arise from any kind of alcohol
       consumption? On the other hand, think about all the damage that
       it often causes.

        Dwell more on the idea that although we have a lot of knowl-
       edge for our time, we don’t necessarily have more wisdom. In what
       ways can knowledge without wisdom be even more dangerous
       than a lack of knowledge without wisdom? What are some recent
       examples we can see of just how damaging knowledge without
       wisdom can be?

        Review the characteristics of the “virtuous woman.” How can
       the principles behind what is revealed in this specific situation be
       applied to believers, whatever their gender, marital status, or age?

        The book of Proverbs is filled with practical wisdom. This
       should tell us that our religion, even with all its lofty theology and
       spiritual dimensions, has a very practical side to it, as well. How
       can we make sure that we don’t neglect the practical aspects of
       faith as we seek to fulfill its theological and spiritual dimensions?

                                                    Story
“Sabbath Shoes”
   Becky needed a new pair of shoes. Going to her favorite shop near
Newport Beach, California, she picked out a pair but discovered her size
wasn’t in stock.
   Dwight McKeever, the sales rep, assured her that her size could be
ordered, and the shoes would be in by Wednesday afternoon.
   Becky returned on Wednesday, but the shoes hadn’t arrived. On Thursday,
still no shoes. When Becky came into the shop late Friday afternoon,
Dwight explained that the delivery truck hadn’t arrived but would any time
soon. Becky waited a few more minutes, but then said she had to go. Fifteen
minutes after she left the store, the shoes arrived.
   Quickly phoning Becky’s home, Dwight left a message. Sometime later,
she returned his call, explaining that she would wear her old shoes the next
day and pick up the new ones on Saturday night.
   Just a few minutes later, Becky returned to the store. “I just came to let
you know that I’m not angry that the shoes didn’t arrive on time and that
I’m very impressed with all you’ve done to help solve this problem.” Then
she turned to leave.
   “But what about your shoes?” Dwight asked. “I’ll get them tomorrow
night,” came the response as Becky walked out the door. Thinking that
maybe she needed money, Dwight offered her a loan, but money wasn’t
the problem. Frustrated, Dwight couldn’t understand what the problem was.
   Finally Becky explained, “I’m a Christian. I want to honor God on the
Sabbath.”
   “Sabbath?” The only Sabbath Dwight knew of was the rock group Black
Sabbath.
   “I’m a Christian too,” he told her, “but what does that have to do with
buying shoes?”
   “If you’re a Christian,” she replied with a smile, “then you know that the
Ten Commandments tell us to keep the Sabbath holy and that means we
shouldn’t buy or sell.”
   Intrigued, Dwight wanted to learn more. Becky invited him to a
Revelation Seminar being held nearby, and he accepted. “I had picked up
the Bible a few times and wanted to know how it would all end, so I went
straight to the last book but couldn’t understand a thing,” he recalls. “There
was a beast with all these heads, but I wasn’t too worried because I knew
with nuclear warfare we could just blow up all those heads.”
   When he told that to Becky, she laughed. “You might want to come to the
seminar and learn what it’s really all about.”
   To see how Becky’s faithfulness led Dwight and many of his family to
accept Bible truth, continue reading the story in Mission magazine, for first
quarter 2015, or online at www.adventistmission.org/mqa-home.

        Bible Study Guide for the Second Quarter
2015
         Luke, a Gentile convert and doctor, directed his Gospel account
       to Greek and Gentile members of the community of faith while
       not disregarding the Jewish roots of Jesus. Luke presents Jesus,
       the Son of man, as the Savior of the world and friend of humanity.
       We will study his account in our second quarter 2015 study guide,
       entitled The Book of Luke by John M. Fowler. The universality
       of salvation is the underlying theme of his Gospel, and so Luke’s
       genealogy traces Jesus all the way to Adam and links Him to God.
       Luke’s Gospel is the largest in the New Testament, and it contains
       six miracles and 13 parables that are unique to its account. Some
       theologians have recommended the book of Luke as a good biogra-
       phy of our Lord Jesus. So as a world church, the book of Luke will
       be the focus of our study for second quarter 2015.

       Thursday: The Witnesses to the Savior (Luke 2:25–32)
       Memory Text—Luke 1:37, NKJV
       Sabbath Gem: Luke’s readers must stand in awe and wonder at
       the fact that Jesus is real, and that through Him, God has invaded his-
       tory with the “ ‘Savior, who is Christ the Lord’ ” (Luke 2:11, NKJV).

Lesson 2—Baptism and the Temptations
       The Week at a Glance:
       Sunday: Prepare the Way of the Lord (Luke 3:1–14)

       Sabbath Gem: Jesus was baptized and received the benediction
       of Heaven that He is God’s “beloved son” (Luke 3:22) and began His
       ministry at the time when the Roman Empire was being ruled by
       great historical dignitaries.
