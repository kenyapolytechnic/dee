Revival and Reformation

I       n every generation, God’s Spirit strives to bring revival to the hearts of His
        people. Revival is an ongoing, daily experience. Each of us should identify
        with an old hymn that says: “Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it, / Prone to leave
the God I love” (From “Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing” by Robert Robinson).
Deep within, we know these words are true.
   Our hearts are, indeed, prone to wander. Our minds drift from the eternal to the
mundane. Our thoughts turn so easily from the heavenly to the earthly. Too often
we seem to be in bondage to deeply entrenched habits. At times our own attitudes
and reactions baffle us.
   And that’s because our natures are fallen (Jer. 17:9) as the result of sin. Our natu-
ral tendency is to turn from God’s way to our own (Isa. 53:6). With the apostle Paul
we cry out, “O wretched man that I am” (Rom. 7:24), and with David we plead,
“Revive me, O Lord, according to your lovingkindness” (Ps. 119:159, NKJV).
   Revival is all about a God of loving-kindness seeking to deepen His relationship
with us. The initiative in revival is His. His Spirit creates longings within us. His
Spirit convicts us of our need. His Spirit reveals Jesus’ goodness and grace.
   Throughout history, God’s Spirit has moved mightily in revival. When Israel
drifted from God’s plan and purposes, God used the young King Josiah to lead the
nation back to Him, and a mighty revival followed. At the dedication of the temple,
God said to Solomon: “ ‘If My people who are called by My name will humble
themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I
will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land’ ” (2 Chron.
7:14, NKJV). God’s heart longing was for Israel to meet the conditions of revival,
experience the power of revival, and reveal the light of His love to the entire world.
   When God’s people responded to His appeals for revival, He worked might-
ily in their behalf. This was true for the New Testament Christian church, the
Reformation, and the Advent Movement. It will also be true for God’s end-time
people. His Holy Spirit will be poured out in its fullness
and the earth will be “illuminated with his glory” (Rev.
18:1, NKJV).                                                 Revival is all about
   This quarter’s lessons focus on the varied aspects of a God of loving-
revival and reformation. Together we will probe such kindness seeking to
questions as, What are the conditions that God has
given for the outpouring of His Spirit? Is God waiting

life? Is there anything we can do to cooperate with God revival is His.
in order to receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit
now? Where does revival and reformation begin?
   Ellen G. White described the importance of revival in these words: “A revival of
true godliness among us is the greatest and most urgent of all our needs.”—Selected
Messages, book 1, p. 121. Heaven places priority on revival. What could be more
important? This quarter, as we study such topics as prayer and revival, the Word
and revival, witnessing and revival, a finished work and revival, and other related
subjects, let us pray that God will powerfully speak to our hearts and draw us closer
to Him.
   Why not open your heart to the moving of His Spirit right now? Why not ask
Him to do something extra special in your life today? He will answer your prayers,
and heavenly blessings will flow in ways that you have not yet imagined.

      Revival: Our Great Need




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Rev. 3:14–21, Heb. 12:7–11,
      Matt. 25:1–13, Zech. 3:1–5, Song of Sol. 5:2–5.

Memory Text: “ ‘Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any-
      one hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and
      dine with him and he with Me’ ” (Revelation 3:20, NKJV).



      L
             aodicea is the last church in Revelation’s sequence of seven
             churches. The name means “a people judged.” It is also a fitting
             symbol for God’s last-day people.
         Laodicea was located in an open valley in southwestern Turkey.
      It was an important financial capital, a fashion mecca, and an edu-
      cational and medical center. Its inhabitants were independent, self-
      confident, and rich.
         The one vital natural resource that the city lacked, however, was
      water. The water was piped in via Roman aqueducts from a spring
      that was five miles south of the city. By the time the water reached
      Laodicea, it was lukewarm. Jesus uses that symbolism to represent
      the lukewarm condition of His last-day church, described as self-
      confident, complacent, apathetic, and spiritually indifferent. It is a
      church that has lost its passion. It is a church that needs a spiritual
      revival.
         Nevertheless, the Laodicean message is filled with hope. Christ
      speaks to His people in love, offering to meet their heart needs and
      revive their deepest spiritual longings.

     Hope for Lukewarm Laodiceans
       Jesus addresses each of the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3
     with a title of Himself that is appropriate for their spiritual condition.
     The titles He uses in His message to the church of Laodicea ring with
     the assurance of spiritual renewal for all those who will heed His
     call.

Read the following Bible passages (Rev. 3:14, 15; 2 Cor. 1:20; John
     3:10, 11; Col. 1:13–17). Why do you think that Jesus uses the titles
     “the Amen,” “the faithful and true witness,” and “the beginning
     of the creation of God” to address the Laodicean church?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        In Revelation 3:14, the Greek word for “beginning” is arche. It can
     mean “beginning,” in the sense that the one to whom it refers is the
     beginner of the event or action. In this context, arche refers to Jesus
     as the Beginner, or the first cause of all creation. In other words, He
     is the Creator (John 1:1–3; Eph. 3:8, 9).
        This is extremely significant. Jesus, the One who spoke and worlds
     came into being, the One who created the earth, the One who spoke
     life into existence—this same Jesus speaks hope to Laodicea. The all-
     powerful Creator can create new life. He can re-create new spiritual
     longings in our hearts. He can transform our spiritual lives.

Read 2 Corinthians 5:17 and Galatians 6:14, 15. What do these texts
     mean to you?

      Why is the Laodicean message a message of hope? What is it
      about the introduction to this message of strong rebuke that
      encourages you? Which of the three titles of Jesus do you iden-
      tify with the most, and why?

     A Loving Rebuke
Read Revelation 3:15, 16. Why does Jesus give the Laodicean church
     such a strong rebuke? What does it mean to be lukewarm? What
     other words might Jesus have used in place of “lukewarm”?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Commenting on Revelation 3:15 and 16, Ellen G. White states:
     “The message to the Laodicean church applies most decidedly to
     those whose religious experience is insipid, who do not bear decided
     witness in favor of the truth.”—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7,
     p. 962. This is a fascinating statement. An insipid religious experience
     is one that is lifeless. It has the outer husk of Christianity but lacks
     the substance. It has the external form but lacks the living power.
     The Laodiceans are not heretics or fiery fanatics; they are, simply,
     spiritually indifferent. The Laodiceans appear to be good moral
     people. They have what Paul calls “a form of godliness but denying
     its power” (2 Tim. 3:5, NKJV). Jesus speaks of religious people in
     His day who “draw near to [Him] with their mouth and honor [Him]
     with their lips, but their heart is far from [Him]” (Matt. 15:8, NKJV).

Read Hebrews 12:7–11; Job 5:17–19; Psalm 94:12; and Proverbs
     29:15, 17, and describe God’s purpose in His rebukes.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Our Lord loves His people too much to let them go easily to perdi-
     tion. He will do whatever it takes to rekindle a spiritual flame in their
     hearts. His strong rebuke is because of a stronger love. His chastise-
     ment is only because of His longing to heal us. The prophet Hosea
     echoes this sentiment with this call to repentance: “Come, and let
     us return to the Lord; for He has torn, but He will heal us; He has
     stricken, but He will bind us up” (Hos. 6:1, NKJV).
      Has God ever used painful, even embarrassing, experiences to
      humble you and draw you closer to Him? What did you learn
      from these experiences that, ideally, ensures you won’t have to
      go through them again?

     Perception and Reality
       There is a gap between what Laodicea says and does. There is an
     even greater gap between the spiritual experience that Laodicea thinks
     she has and what she actually does have.

Read Revelation 3:17. What is Laodicea’s evaluation of herself?
     What is our Lord’s assessment of her? How do you think a people
     could be so blinded to their true spiritual condition? In what ways
     might we be blind regarding our own spiritual condition?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       One of Satan’s fatal deceptions is to blind us to the reality of
     our spiritual needs. Some of the religious leaders of Jesus’ day
     were blind to their own spiritual poverty. They were Bible-reading,
     Sabbath-keeping, tithe-paying “church” members looking for the
     coming of the Messiah. Yet, many were in darkness regarding the
     type of spiritual kingdom that He would usher in. Jesus called them
     “blind guides” (Matt. 23:24). Paul writes to the church at Corinth
     about those “whose minds the god of this age has blinded” (2 Cor.
     4:4, NKJV). This is why Jesus said that He came for the “ ‘recovery
     of sight to the blind’ ” (Luke 4:18, NKJV). Jesus will restore the
     spiritual eyesight that we have lost if we allow Him. Every time that
     Jesus opened blind eyes in the New Testament, He was revealing
     His desire to open the eyes of our minds in order to enable us to see
     Him clearly.

Read Matthew 25:1–13. What are the similarities between the foolish
     virgins and the members of the church at Laodicea?

     The Divine Remedy
       There is hope for Laodicea, just as there is hope for all who are
     afflicted with spiritual apathy and indifference. Our Lord has the
     divine remedy. The fact that the Lord speaks to this church shows
     that hope for the church exists if His people accept and follow His
     counsel.

Reflect on Jesus’ counsel in Revelation 3:18, 19. What does Jesus
     mean when He talks about “gold refined in the fire,” being
     clothed in “white garments,” and our eyes being anointed with
     “eye salve”? See also 1 Pet. 1:7, Zech. 3:1–5, Rev. 19:7–9, Eph.
     4:30.

     ________________________________________________________

        “Jesus is going from door to door, standing in front of every soul-
     temple, proclaiming, ‘I stand at the door, and knock.’ As a heavenly
     merchantman, he opens his treasures, and cries, ‘Buy of me gold tried
     in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou may-
     est be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear.’
     The gold he offers is without alloy, more precious than that of Ophir;
     for it is faith and love.
        “The white raiment he invites the soul to wear is his own robes of
     righteousness, and the oil for anointing is the oil of his grace, which
     will give spiritual eyesight to the soul in blindness and darkness, that
     he may distinguish between the workings of the Spirit of God and the
     spirit of the enemy. Open your doors, says the great Merchantman, the
     possessor of spiritual riches, and transact your business with me. It is
     I, your Redeemer, who counsels you to buy of me.”—Ellen G. White,
     The Advent Review and Sabbath Herald, Aug. 7, 1894.

      Ellen G. White quotes Revelation 3:20, saying of Jesus, “ ‘I
      stand at the door, and knock.’ ” Jesus knocks; He doesn’t break
      down the door and force His way in. What this means is that, in
      the end, regardless of what God is willing to do for us, we must
      make the choice to let Him in. Ask yourself, “How resistant am
      I to opening the door to Him?” If you are resistant, ask yourself,
      “Why?” What is holding you back? What sin, what indulgence,
      don’t you want to let go of, or what is it that you find so hard
      to let go of?

     A Relentless Love
Compare Revelation 3:20 to Song of Solomon 5:2–5. What simi-
     larities do you find in both instances? What do these passages
     reveal about God’s love?

     ________________________________________________________

       The evening meal in the Middle East was and still is extremely
     important. When the work of the day was over and the men returned
     from the fields for the evening meal, the entire family gathered around
     the table. In most instances the extended family lived together. The
     number at the evening meal often would be quite large. Grandfather
     and grandmother, brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, nephews
     and nieces and cousins, adults and children might be present. In this
     grand reunion after a hard day’s work, stories were told, experiences
     shared, and counsel given. It was a time of fellowship. It was a time
     of warmth and family intimacy. Jesus longs to have fellowship like
     this with us, as well.

How does Christ’s promise in Revelation 3:21 reveal His heartfelt
     desire for each one of us?

     ________________________________________________________

        The book of Revelation mentions God’s throne more than forty
     times. This is more than in any other book of the Bible. At God’s
     throne, we join in with the heavenly chorus and joyously proclaim:
     “ ‘Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and riches and
     wisdom, and strength and honor and glory and blessing’ ” (Rev. 5:12,
     NKJV). He promises that we can participate in this grand festive scene
     of rejoicing once the long saga of sin ends.
        Christ uses His greatest motivation for His indifferent end-time
     people. The greatest motivation to wake us from spiritual slumber is
     Jesus’ endless love, for He longs to spend all eternity with us. If that
     is not enough to shake us out of our spiritual apathy, what is? If that
     is not enough to bring us to our knees, seeking revival, what will?
     His love has provided eternity for us. We have royal blood running
     through our veins. We are sons and daughters of the King of the uni-
     verse. We can reign with Him, seated upon His throne forever.

      Christ longs to be in fellowship with you. How much do you
      want to be in fellowship with Him? The answer is simple. How
      much time do you spend in prayer and fellowship with the
      Lord? What does your answer tell you about yourself and, per-
      haps, just how lukewarm you might be?
                                                                         11

    Further Study: “A revival and a reformation must take place under
         the ministration of the Holy Spirit. Revival and reformation are two
         different things. Revival signifies a renewal of spiritual life, a quick-
         ening of the powers of mind and heart, a resurrection from the spiri-
         tual death. Reformation signifies a reorganization, a change in ideas
         and theories, habits and practices. Reformation will not bring forth the
         good fruit of righteousness unless it is connected with the revival of
         the Spirit. Revival and reformation are to do their appointed work, and
         in doing this work they must blend.”—Ellen G. White, The Advent
         Review and Sabbath Herald, Feb. 25, 1902.

1           “The counsel of the True Witness is full of encouragement and
         comfort. The churches may yet obtain the gold of truth, faith, and
         love, and be rich in heavenly treasure. ‘Buy of me gold that thou may-
         est be rich, and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed, and that
         the shame of thy nakedness do not appear.’ The white raiment is the
         righteousness of Christ that may be wrought into the character. Purity
2        of heart, purity of motive, will characterize every one who is washing
         his robe, and making it white in the blood of the Lamb.”—Ellen G.
         White, The Advent Review and Sabbath Herald, July 24, 1888.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 What is so dangerous about being lukewarm? Why can it lead
          us so easily to spiritual self-deception?
3
          l2 Why do some Christians seem so radiant and others so indif-
          ferent? Is it a matter of different personality types, or is there
          something deeper? If so, what?

          l3 Discuss with your class ways in which to avoid becoming
          spiritually indifferent. How can we keep our spiritual experi-
          ence vibrant and growing? What are things that we can do as
          a church body, as a whole, to protect ourselves from becoming
          “lukewarm”?

          l
          4 Why do you think God would rather have us be “cold” than
          “lukewarm”? Why isn’t being lukewarm better than being flat-
          out cold? Hint: what’s more comfortable, being lukewarm or
          being cold?

Ibrahim’s Question
   Ibrahim, 9, lives in the country of Azerbaijan. Most people in
Azerbaijan are religious, but they are not Christians. Ibrahim loves going
with his mother to do missionary work. Often they take a minibus to a vil-
lage near their home. Ibrahim likes to sit near the driver so they can talk.
One day the driver asked Ibrahim some questions: “How many eyes do
two birds have?”
   “Four!” Ibrahim said. “Now I have a question for you. How many days
did it take God to create the earth?” The driver didn’t know. “It took six
days,” Ibrahim said. “If you want to know more about what God does, you
should buy a book from my mom. It’s called Only Allah Gives Us Peace.”
   Some people on the bus heard Ibrahim talking to the driver. One of them
asked Ibrahim’s mother about the book Ibrahim had mentioned. She told
them that the book is about people who are faithful to Allah [God]. “How
can we get the book?” a man asked. Ibrahim’s mother usually sold the
book to help pay their bus fare, but she let Ibrahim give a copy to each of
the people on the bus for free.
   Ibrahim walked down the aisle giving one to each person. The people
smiled and said, “Sahg-ohl” (thank you).
   As Ibrahim and his mother got off the bus, he noticed several passengers
reading the book he’d given them. We’ve just arrived at the village, and
already we’ve shared God’s Word with many people, he realized.
   At school, every student takes part in a religion class. One day Ibrahim’s
teacher read the story of Noah. Then she quizzed the students about the
story. “What did God tell Noah to do?” she asked.
   Ibrahim raised his hand. “God told Noah to build a boat,” he answered.
   “Yes,” the teacher said. “And how long did it take to build the boat?”
   “It took Noah 120 years to build the boat and warn the people about
the flood.
   Ibrahim answered confidently. “But no one chose to enter the boat
except Noah and his family—eight people. So, God sent the animals into
the boat and closed the door. Then the flood came.”
   “How do you know so much about this story?” the teacher asked
Ibrahim.
   “My mother and I read the sacred writings together,” Ibrahim said.
Ibrahim and his mother share God’s message of love in a land where
Jesus isn’t worshiped as God. Our mission offerings help believers in dif-
ficult countries to share God’s message of hope with people who’ve never
heard. Thank you for giving so that others can hear God’s message of love.

      Prayer: The Heartbeat of
      Revival


      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Acts 1:4, 8, 14; Mark 1:35;
      Luke 5:16; Matt. 18:19, 20; 2 Cor. 10:3–5; Ps. 50:23.

Memory Text: “ ‘If you then, being evil, know how to give good
      gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in
      heaven give good things to those who ask Him!’ ” (Matthew 7:11,
      NKJV).



      G
               od moves powerfully as His people pray. Alfred Lord
               Tennyson was certainly correct when he said, “More things
               are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of.” The
      great revivals throughout Scripture were bathed in prayer. The Old
      Testament records the intercession of the patriarchs and prophets
      as they sought for revival. Moses, David, and Daniel petitioned the
      Almighty for power. The book of Acts reveals New Testament believ-
      ers on their knees storming heaven, seeking the outpouring of the
      Holy Spirit.
        Jesus’ prayer life reveals a constant dependence on His heavenly
      Father. The gospels give us glimpses of the source of His spiritual
      power. It was on His knees alone with the Father that the Savior
      received His greatest strength.
        “A revival need be expected only in answer to prayer.”—Ellen G.
      White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 121. During this week’s lesson,
      we will explore the role that prayer played in some of the great reviv-
      als in the Bible.

*Study this week’s lesson to prepare for Sabbath, July 13.

      Prayer and Revival in Acts
         The believers in Acts were filled with power from on high. The
      Holy Spirit was poured out in a marked way. Hearts were touched,
      lives changed. The gospel penetrated the most difficult places, and
      thousands were converted. In Acts 2, three thousand were added to
      the church (Acts 2:41). Acts 4:4 records that the number of men alone
      who believed “was about five thousand.” Even many of the religious
      leaders, who opposed Jesus during His lifetime, became “obedient to
      the faith” (Acts 6:7). The story of this phenomenal growth continues
      in Acts 9, which said that churches throughout “all Judea, Galilee,
      and Samaria” were “multiplied” (Acts 9:31, NKJV). By Acts 10 to 12
      the gospel spanned cultural and geographical boundaries. The Roman
      centurion and the treasurer of the queen of Ethiopia were baptized.
      Acts 1 says that about one hundred twenty believers met in the upper
      room (Acts 1:13, 15). The best estimates are that by the end of the
      first century there were at least one million Christians in the Roman
      Empire. This is remarkable growth by any standard.
         What was the secret?

Look up the following texts. What was a major reason for the growth of
      the New Testament church? Acts 1:4, 8, 14; 2:42; 4:31, 33; 6:3, 4.

        Pastor R. A. Torrey was a powerful revival preacher in the late
      nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He conducted revival meet-
      ings in Great Britain from 1903–1905 and throughout North America
      in 1906 and 1907. Lamenting the busyness of Christians, he stated,
      “We are too busy to pray, and so we are too busy to have power. We
      have a great deal of activity, but we accomplish little; many services
      but few conversions, much machinery but few results.”

       Are you too busy to pray? Who can’t relate to that? How can
       you slow down enough to take the time you need to pray? Think
       about all the excuses that you have to put it off, the reasons that
       you give to do other things. In the end, what is it that you are
       losing by not spending time in prayer?

     Jesus’ Prayer Life
Compare the following texts: Mark 1:35, Luke 5:16, 9:18. What
     three specific things do these passages reveal about Jesus’ prayer
     life?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        “Christ was continually receiving from the Father, that he might
     communicate to us. ‘The word which ye hear,’ he said, ‘is not mine,
     but the Father’s which sent me.’ ‘The Son of Man came not to be
     ministered unto, but to minister.’ Not for himself, but for others, he
     lived and thought and prayed. From hours spent with God he came
     forth morning by morning, to bring the light of heaven to men. Daily
     he received a fresh baptism of the Holy Spirit. In the early hours of
     the new day the Lord awakened him from his slumbers, and his soul
     and his lips were anointed with grace, that he might impart to others.”
     —Ellen G. White, The Review and Herald, Aug. 11, 1910.

Examine the passages below. Identify each of the things for which
     Jesus prayed. How do Jesus’ prayers reveal His most important
     concerns? What is the most distinctive component of each of
     Jesus’ prayers?

     John 17:20–24____________________________________________

     Luke 22:31, 32 ___________________________________________

     Matt. 26:36–44____________________________________________

       Prayer was a vital part of Jesus’ life. It was His lifeline to the
     Father. Daily the Savior renewed His relationship with His Father
     through prayer. Jesus’ prayer life gave Him the courage and strength
     to face the temptations of the enemy. He came from these prayer
     sessions with a deepened commitment to do the Father’s will. They
     provided Him with a spiritual freshness and power. Describing one
     of Jesus’ times of prayer, Luke adds, “As He prayed, the appearance
     of His face was altered, and His robe became white and glistening”
     (Luke 9:29, NKJV). Jesus experienced spiritual refreshing and a
     renewed experience with the Father each day through His prayer life.

      Spend a few moments reflecting on some specific times that
      God powerfully answered your prayers. How can recalling and
      reflecting on these experiences deepen your prayer life today?

     Praying Together
        Although Jesus often spent time alone in prayer, there were mul-
     tiple occasions when He encouraged His closest disciples to pray
     with Him. Peter, James, and John accompanied Jesus to the mount
     of transfiguration (Matt. 17:1, 2). He urged them to unite with Him
     in prayer in Gethsemane (Luke 22:39–46). There is unusual power in
     united prayer.

Carefully analyze Matthew 18:19, 20. Summarize Jesus’ statement
     regarding united prayer.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       “The promise is made on condition that the united prayers of
     God’s people are offered, and in answer to these prayers there may
     be expected a power greater than that which comes in answer to
     private prayer. The power given will be proportionate to the unity of
     the members and their love for God and for one another.”—Ellen G.
     White, The Central Advance, Feb. 25, 1903.
       John Bunyan once commented, “You can do more than pray, after
     you have prayed, but you cannot do more than pray until you have
     prayed.”
       As we enter into earnest and heartfelt intercession, the Holy Spirit
     powerfully works in miraculous ways through our united prayers.

Read Acts 12:1–16. What was Peter’s situation? What was the
     attitude of the church? What does this passage tell us about the
     power of united prayer?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        No question, in this case Peter had a miraculous deliverance. It was
     so intense that Peter wasn’t even sure it was real and that he wasn’t
     in a vision. Only afterward did he realize what had happened. It’s
     important to note that these texts stated twice that people were praying
     together. Considering the tough circumstances, it is no wonder. There
     is no question that we should do the same, especially when we face
     challenges as a community, such as they did there.
                                                                         17

     Our Freedom
        Have you ever wondered why prayer is so vital? Why do we have
     to ask Him for the Holy Spirit? Isn’t He willing to give the Holy Spirit
     to us?
        The answer to these questions lies in understanding God’s respect
     for our freedom of choice. He has created us with the ability to make
     moral choices. God is doing everything He can for us and through us
     before we pray, but He is limited by our choices (Ps. 78:41, 42).
        In prayer we freely acknowledge our total dependency upon God
     and give Him the freedom to intervene in our lives. The more we pray,
     the more we acknowledge His all sufficiency. When we pray, His
     Holy Spirit prepares our hearts to receive more of Him. The more we
     pray, the more we allow the Holy Spirit to “crucify” our sinful desires.
     In the great controversy between good and evil, prayer enables God to
     work more powerfully in our lives.

Analyze 2 Corinthians 10:3–5. How would you define the expres-
     sion “the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in
     God” (NKJV)? What are these weapons? What kind of warfare
     is Paul talking about here, and why would he use this kind of
     imagery? How are we to understand the battle in which we are
     engaged?

        As Seventh-day Adventists, we understand the reality of the great
     controversy between Christ and Satan. We know that it is real and that
     we all are involved in it. Left alone, we would be hopeless against
     Satan. Our only hope is our connection with Jesus, and central to that
     connection is our prayer life—a spiritual weapon for a spiritual battle,
     a weapon that none of us can do without. If Jesus needed to pray, how
     much more so do we?
        “We, too, must have times set apart for meditation and prayer and
     for receiving spiritual refreshing. We do not value the power and effi-
     cacy of prayer as we should. Prayer and faith will do what no power
     on earth can accomplish.”—Ellen G. White, The Ministry of Healing,
     p. 509.

      In what ways have you experienced in your own life the harsh
      reality of the great controversy between Christ and Satan?
      How has prayer aided you in this struggle? Where would you
      be without it?

      Effective Prayer
        There are many effective ways to pray. Some people have found it
      helpful to kneel before God with their Bibles open. Then they read a
      few verses and commune with God about what they are reading.
        The Psalms are particularly inspirational as subject matter for
      prayer. Try meditating upon a particular psalm during your prayer
      times. Take one verse at a time. Read it aloud, and then talk to God
      about what the text is saying to you.
        Others have found that their most meaningful prayer times are
      alone with God in some quiet natural setting. Still others have blended
      singing and prayer.

What do we learn about effective prayer from the following verses?
      Pss. 34:1, 50:23, 67:3, 71:6.

      ________________________________________________________

         David’s prayers were filled with adoration or praise. When we
      meditate upon God’s goodness and matchless love, our hearts over-
      flow with praise.

Read Daniel 9:8–13. What kind of prayer is this?
      ________________________________________________________

What feature does Paul add to an effective prayer life? Eph. 5:20.
      ________________________________________________________

What is the meaning of supplication in Ephesians 6:18 and Philippians
      4:6, and why is this an important component of prayer?

      ________________________________________________________

         Though we don’t want to give a formula for prayer, a broad outline
      could be as follows: we start with praise and adoration, thanking God
      for His goodness to us. We then confess our faults and shortcomings,
      and then thank God for His forgiveness. We conclude with supplica-
      tions, making our requests known to Him, all the while seeking an
      attitude of submission and trust in His divine power.

       Has your prayer life not been what it should or could be? What
       do you need to do differently? Why not make a more concentrated
       effort to spend more time in prayer? It can change your life.

                      F riday July 12

    Further Study: “Keep your wants, your joys, your sorrows, your
         cares, and your fears before God. You cannot burden Him; you cannot
         weary Him. He who numbers the hairs of your head is not indifferent
         to the wants of His children. ‘The Lord is very pitiful, and of tender
         mercy.’ James 5:11. His heart of love is touched by our sorrows and
         even by our utterances of them. Take to Him everything that per-
         plexes the mind. Nothing is too great for Him to bear, for He holds
         up worlds, He rules over all the affairs of the universe. Nothing that
         in any way concerns our peace is too small for Him to notice. There
         is no chapter in our experience too dark for Him to read; there is no
1
         perplexity too difficult for Him to unravel. No calamity can befall
         the least of His children, no anxiety harass the soul, no joy cheer,
         no sincere prayer escape the lips, of which our heavenly Father is
         unobservant, or in which He takes no immediate interest. ‘He healeth
         the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.’ Psalm 147:3. The
         relations between God and each soul are as distinct and full as though
2
         there were not another soul upon the earth to share His watch care, not
         another soul for whom He gave His beloved Son.”—Ellen G. White,
         Steps to Christ, p. 100.

    Discussion Questions:
          l1 Why do we need to pray if God knows everything? Though
          many answers can be given, perhaps the most important one is
3         that we have been told, time and again in the Bible, to pray. Even
          if we don’t understand how it works, those who pray effectively
          know that it does work. You might take a medicine that helps
          to bring healing to your body, even though you don’t know how
          that medication works. It’s the same with prayer. What other
          reasons can you give for the importance of prayer, especially as
          we seek revival and reformation?

          l
          2 Read over prayerfully the Ellen G. White statement found
          in Friday’s Further Study. Look at all the encouragement that
          is found in there, especially in the last line that addresses the
          relationship between God and the praying supplicant. What can
          you do, what choices can you make, to enter into the kind of close
          communion with the Lord that is described here?

          l
          3 In class, talk about the reality of the great controversy and
          how it’s being manifested in your own church community. Talk
          about how praying together can help you all work through what-
          ever challenges you are facing.

Show Me Your Church: Part 1
   Roger’s stomach tightened as he waited to see the director of his school.
I will stay true to God, no matter what this man decides.
   Roger was in his final year of secondary school. Soon he would take the
national exams that would grant—or deny—him the right to pursue higher
education. Roger had taken the exams before, but when one of the exams
fell on Sabbath, he had chosen to honor God rather than take the exam. He
had accepted the failing grade as a price he could pay for his faithfulness
to God. He planned to try again the next year, but civil unrest in Central
African Republic forced his family to flee to the Republic of the Congo. He
now faced the same problem in a foreign country.
   On the first day of classes in his new school, Roger had gone to the
school’s director to explain his religious beliefs and ask to be excused from
school functions on Sabbath, a regular school day. The director had been
polite, but his response was simply “We’ll see how it goes.” Roger could
only hope—and pray—that the man would honor his request.
   When Roger looked at his class schedule, he saw that nearly every exam
was scheduled for a Sabbath. Roger asked the teachers to give him his exam
on another day. Some did, but others refused.
   “You are just one student among so many,” the director told him. “I
am a Christian too. Show me where God says that we must not work on
Saturday.”
   Roger opened his Bible to Exodus 20 and began reading the Sabbath
commandment.
   “I didn’t know that,” the director said thoughtfully. “Why don’t you wor-
ship your God in the morning, and come to school after lunch?” It seemed
like such a reasonable request.
   Patiently Roger explained the Sabbath, which began at sunset on Friday.
He read Bible texts to support his explanation.
                                The director thought for a moment, and then
                             said, “Show me your church.”
                                Roger sat back. How can I show him my
                             church? he thought. In all of the Congo we have
                             not one church.
                                Before Roger could answer, the director
                             made another request. “Can you bring me your
                             church pastor?” Roger smiled. He could bring
                             a pastor.

      The Word: The Foundation
      of Revival




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Ps. 119:50, 74, 116; Heb.
      4:12; 11:3; John 5:39; Heb. 4:1, 2; Acts 20:27–32.

Memory Text: “Plead my cause and redeem me; revive me ac-
      cording to Your word” (Psalm 119:154, NKJV).



      J
           ust as serious Bible study spawned past revival movements, we
           believe that it will happen again in the last days. The Holy Spirit
           will move upon a generation of committed Adventist Christians
      who have discovered His will in His Word and are passionate about
      proclaiming it to the world.
        They will have found grace and strength and hope in His Word;
      they will have come face-to-face with the matchless charms of Christ
      in His Word. Thus, God will honor their commitment by pouring out
      His Holy Spirit in abundance, and the whole world will be lightened
      with the glory of the three angels’ messages. The Holy Spirit will be
      poured out beyond measure, and the gospel will be carried to the ends
      of the earth, and Jesus Christ will return (Matt. 24:14).
        In this week’s lesson we will study the role of the Bible in revival
      and how God’s Word can make a life-changing difference in us if we
      surrender ourselves in faith and obedience to its precepts and truths.

      Revived Through the Word
Look up each of the verses below. On the first line write the plea.
      On the second line write the circumstance that led David to make
      the plea.

      Ps. 119:25 (Plea)__________________________________________

      (Circumstance)____________________________________________

      Ps. 119:107 (Plea)_________________________________________

      (Circumstance)____________________________________________

      Ps. 119:153, 154 (Plea)_____________________________________

      (Circumstance)____________________________________________

In the Psalms, David talks about the blessings of the Word in his own
      spiritual life. Read the following verses from Psalm 119 and
      choose a word from each verse that best summarizes the blessings
      that the psalmist discovered in that Word. Ps. 119:50, 74, 116,
      130, 160, 169, 170.

         David found courage and strength in God’s Word. He discovered
      hope and divine guidance in God’s Word. The Word of God brought
      light to his darkened mind (Ps. 119:130). It nourished his famished
      heart and quenched his thirsty soul (Ps. 119:81). When Saul threat-
      ened to kill him, he clung to God’s promise of deliverance (Ps.
      34:4). Plagued with guilt after his adulterous affair with Bathsheba,
      he clung to God’s promise of forgiveness (Ps. 32:1, 2). Perplexed
      regarding the future, he clung to God’s promise of guidance (Ps.
      32:8). David jubilantly exclaimed, “Your word has given me life”
      (Ps. 119:50, NKJV). The foundation of revival is all about finding
      new life in God’s Word.

       How can you learn to draw hope, strength, assurance, and light
       from the Word of God? That is, how can you have a deeper
       experience with the Lord through coming to know Him as He
       is revealed in the Bible?
                                                                       23

      The Word’s Creative Power
Read Hebrews 4:12. The passage states that God’s Word is living,
      powerful, and sharper than a two-edged sword, piercing our
      inmost being. How is God’s Word alive? What does that mean?
      ________________________________________________________
      ________________________________________________________
      ________________________________________________________

In what way is God’s Word different from the intelligent counsel of any
      other wise teacher, pastor, or counselor? What do the following
      texts say about the power of God’s Word? Ps. 33:6, 9; Heb. 11:3;
      2 Tim. 3:16, 17.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         There is value in wise human counsel. We have all been helped
      by the advice of others. The problem is that human counsel does
      not carry with it the power to accomplish the kind of change that
      God’s Word can. God’s Word is a living, dynamic, powerful agent of
      change. The same power that was in God’s spoken word at Creation is
      in the Written Word of God. Accepting God’s commands and prom-
      ises by faith, we receive the power of the Holy Spirit to accomplish
      that which Christ commands.
         “The creative energy that called the worlds into existence is in the
      word of God. This word imparts power; it begets life. Every command
      is a promise; accepted by the will, received into the soul, it brings with
      it the life of the Infinite One. It transforms the nature, and re-creates
      the soul in the image of God.”—Ellen G. White, Education, p. 126.
         A casual reading of God’s Word very seldom produces spiritual
      revival. Studying the Bible to prove one’s own position, or to con-
      vince someone else of his or her mistakes, does very little good for
      our own spiritual life. Change comes when we prayerfully read God’s
      Word, asking the Holy Spirit to give us the power to be more like
      Jesus. Real transformation takes place when we ask the God of crea-
      tion to re-create us in His image. Change comes when Jesus’ teach-
      ings in Scripture become part of our lives, and we live “ ‘by every
      word that proceeds out of the mouth of God’ ” (Matt. 4:4).

       In what ways has the power of God’s Word changed your life?
       In which areas do you need to see more of that change?

     Jesus and the Word
How are the functions of the Word of God and the Spirit of God
     similar? Read John 5:39; 16:14, 15.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        The Word of God bears witness of Jesus. The Holy Spirit also bears
     witness of Jesus. The Spirit leads us to a deeper experience with Jesus
     through His Word. The purpose of the Holy Spirit in revival is not
     primarily to manifest Himself through supernatural signs and wonders
     but to exalt Jesus through His Word. The baptism of the Holy Spirit
     is not about our power to accomplish great miracles. It is about God’s
     power to transform our lives—and that’s what revival and reforma-
     tion are all about.
        The Word of God provides the foundation or the basis for all genu-
     ine revival. Our experience flows out of an understanding of God’s
     Word. Our praise and worship spring from minds saturated with the
     Word. A transformed life is the greatest testimony of true revival.
        Positive feelings of praise may accompany revival, but they are
     never the basis for revival. Any so-called “revival” based solely on
     external feelings or experience is shallow at best, deceptive at worst.
     It is an illusion of spirituality, not genuine godliness. When revival is
     rooted in the Word of God, it is an experience that lasts and makes a
     difference in our lives and in the lives of the people around us.
        The story of Jesus’ appearance to the two disciples on the Emmaus
     road reveals the role that the Bible plays in initiating true revival.
     These followers of Christ were filled with confusion. Gradually, how-
     ever, He “expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concern-
     ing Himself ” (Luke 24:27, NKJV). He repeated the Old Testament
     prophecies regarding the Messiah. Jesus could have worked a miracle
     to prove His identity or showed the scars in His hands. He did not.
     Instead, He gave them a Bible study.
        Notice their response as they reflected on what had happened
     that day. “They said to one another, ‘Did not our hearts burn within
     us while He talked with us on the road, and while He opened the
     Scriptures to us?’ ” (Luke 24:32, NKJV).
        What an example of genuine revival!

      Why can’t we trust our feelings? How can our feelings deceive
      us? What role do feelings have in our walk with the Lord, and
      what role do they not have?

                                                                          25

      Revival, Faith, and the Word
         Speaking of the time just before His return, Jesus said,
      “ ‘When the Son of Man comes, will He really find faith on the earth?’ ”
      (Luke 18:8, NKJV). Evidently, faith will be in short supply in the last
      days.
         How might we define biblical faith? Is faith believing that God will
      give us anything we want? Is faith centered in our desires? Is faith
      about asking God for what we want and believing we will receive it
      if we only believe hard enough?
         We should know the answers to those rhetorical questions,
      shouldn’t we?
         Faith, true faith, is always focused on God’s will, not on our wishes.
      It is trusting in God, believing in His promises, and acting on His
      Word. Our faith grows as we listen to God’s Word and put it into
      practice (Rom. 10:17; James 2:17, 18). Opening our minds to the
      teachings of God’s Word builds faith; and doing what God says—
      even if it is contrary to our personal desires—prepares us to receive
      the fullness of the Spirit’s power.

Why do some people receive little benefit from reading the Bible?
      Heb. 4:1, 2.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Our spiritual experience is revived when we accept and claim
      God’s Word by faith. There is little benefit derived from hastily read-
      ing the Bible out of a sense of obligation or duty. We are changed as
      we internalize what we read, and allow the teachings of the Bible to
      mold our thoughts and our lives.

Compare the faith of the Roman centurion, the paralytic at Bethesda,
      and the disciples on the stormy Sea of Galilee (Matt. 8:8–10, John
      5:6–9, Matt. 14:29–33). What can we learn from each account?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

       Faith does not grow merely by reading or listening to God’s
       Word. It comes as we claim His promises as our own and when
       we believe that what He said applies to us personally. God has
       given each one of us a measure of faith. It is one of Heaven’s
       gifts (Rom. 12:3). When we exercise the faith that He has
       already placed in our hearts, that faith cannot help but grow.

     The Word: Revival’s Guardian and
     Safeguard
        The Holy Spirit mightily moved through the teaching and preaching
     of the apostle Paul as he established the Christian church in Ephesus.
     Ephesus was a city of approximately two hundred fifty thousand
     people. It was considered the marketplace of Asia. As ships brought
     their wares from throughout Asia, people flocked to Ephesus to buy
     fine silk, rare jewels, flavorful spices, hand-woven carpets, exquisite
     art objects, and exotic foods. It was also the center for the worship of
     the goddess Diana and the future home of the famed Celsus Library,
     with 12,000 volumes. The city had a magnificent amphitheater seat-
     ing 15,000 people. It was used for massive concerts and theatrical
     productions. Sexual promiscuity was commonplace. If there ever was
     an unlikely place for Christianity to take root, grow, and flourish—it
     was Ephesus.

Read Acts 20:27–32. What was Paul’s concern for the believers
     at Ephesus? What was his counsel to the church members in
     Ephesus? What role did he give to the Word of God?

      the role of the Word of God? Why, then, must the Word of
      God be central to spiritual revival, both on a personal and on
      a corporate level?
                                                                         27

    Further Study: “ ‘To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not
          according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.’ Isaiah
          8:20. The people of God are directed to the Scriptures as their safe-
          guard against the influence of false teachers and the delusive power
          of spirits of darkness. Satan employs every possible device to prevent
          men from obtaining a knowledge of the Bible; for its plain utterances
          reveal his deceptions. At every revival of God’s work the prince of
          evil is aroused to more intense activity; he is now putting forth his
          utmost efforts for a final struggle against Christ and His followers.
          The last great delusion is soon to open before us. Antichrist is to per-
1         form his marvelous works in our sight. So closely will the counterfeit
          resemble the true that it will be impossible to distinguish between
          them except by the Holy Scriptures. By their testimony every state-
          ment and every miracle must be tested.
              “Those who endeavor to obey all the commandments of God will
          be opposed and derided. They can stand only in God. In order to
2         endure the trial before them, they must understand the will of God as
          revealed in His word; they can honor Him only as they have a right
          conception of His character, government, and purposes, and act in
          accordance with them. None but those who have fortified the mind
          with the truths of the Bible will stand through the last great con-
          flict.”—Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, pp. 593, 594.

    Discussion Questions:
3          l1 Read carefully the Ellen G. White statements in Friday’s
           Further Study. What role does she give to the Word of God,
           especially in the context of the last days and the final deceptions?
           Dwell on the implications of this line: “So closely will the coun-
           terfeit resemble the true that it will be impossible to distinguish
           between them except by the Holy Scriptures.” What does this tell
           us about how we need to be careful about judging truth based
           only on personal experience or on the way that we feel?

           l
           2 During the week we read James 1:22, where we are told to
           be “doers of the Word.” What does that mean, and why is that
           so essential for us if we are to have any kind of true spiritual
           revival in our lives? Why is reading about faith and teaching
           about faith and talking about faith so much easier than living it?
           Think through your week: how much of a “doer of the Word”
           were you?

Show Me Your Church: Part 2
   Roger asked his pastor to visit his school and explain what Seventh-
day Adventists believe and why the congregations in the Republic of the
Congo met in houses, sheds, and covered courtyards.
   The next day Roger struggled to listen in class while the pastor and
the field president met with the school director. The meeting seemed to
last forever. Then moments after the pastors left the school, the director
stepped into Roger’s classroom and said, “From now on no exams will
be scheduled for Saturday.” Then, looking at Roger, he added, “Now I
understand why you honor your Sabbath.”
   One day Roger’s biology teacher urged Roger to consider his future
and set aside his faith until he graduated. Roger told him, “I can’t do
that, sir. God commanded me to keep the Sabbath day holy, and I
must obey.” Then he told his teacher about Shadrach, Meshach, and
Abednego, who refused to bow to the king’s image and were thrown
into the fiery furnace. “These men didn’t know if God would choose to
save them,” he said. “But they preferred to die rather than dishonor God.
I can do no less.”
   The teacher asked Roger where his church met. Roger explained
that during the civil war in Congo, the government had confiscated the
church’s clinic and church building. “Today we have no building.” He
reached into his book bag and pulled out his Sabbath School lesson
quarterly and showed him the map on the back cover. “We are few in the
Congo, but we are millions around the world.” The teacher was amazed
that there were millions of Seventh-day Adventists around the world.
He asked many questions about the Seventh-day Adventist Church and
what its members believe, and Roger answered them all. He gave the
teacher some books by Ellen G. White. Many other teachers and fellow
students asked Roger questions about the Bible.
   As the national exams approached, the school director asked Roger
what he would do if an exam fell on Saturday.
   “That’s not my problem,” Roger said. “My duty is to keep the
Sabbath. If that means that I fail the exam, so be it.” When the exam
dates were posted and no exams were scheduled for Sabbath, Roger
knew that God had done this to help him to show others that God honors
those who choose to obey.
   Today thanks to your Thirteenth Sabbath Offerings, two churches
stand as lighthouses in the Republic of the Congo. Your mission offer-
ings do make a difference.

Roger Wazoua passed his exams and is preparing to become a pastor in Africa.

      Witness and Service: The
      Fruit of Revival




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 28:19, 20; John 20:21;
      Acts 2; Acts 22:1–14; John 6:1–11; Acts 8:26–38.

Memory Text: “ ‘You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has
      come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem,
      and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth’ ” (Acts
      1:8, NKJV).



      T
             he purpose of revival is to fill our hearts with such a love for
             Jesus that we long to share this love with every person possible.
             In genuine revival, our own hearts are wakened to God’s good-
      ness, compassion, forgiveness, and power. We are so charmed by His
      love and transformed by His grace that we cannot be silent.
        In contrast, a “revival” that focuses on one’s “spiritual experience
      alone” misses the mark. If it develops attitudes critical of others who
      do not measure up to one’s “standard of holiness,” it is certainly not
      heaven inspired. If the emphasis of revival is to merely change exter-
      nal behavior rather than to change hearts, then something is wrong.
        Changed hearts lead to changed behavior. Genuine revival never
      leads to self-centeredness or, especially, to self-sufficiency or self-
      exaltation. Instead, it always leads to a selfless concern for others.
      When our hearts are renewed by God’s grace, we long to bless and
      serve those who are in need. All genuine revival leads to a renewed
      emphasis on mission and service.

     Christ’s Parting Commission and
     Promise
        Christ did not establish His church in order for it to simply care
     for itself. Jesus’ parting words focused upon the church’s mission.
     Christ’s intention is for His church to look beyond itself. He estab-
     lished it to share the light of His love and the message of His salvation
     with the world.

Read and summarize the following texts. How does each passage
     reveal Jesus’ heart desire for His church?

     Matt. 28:19, 20____________________________________________

     Mark 16:15_______________________________________________

     Luke 24:45–49_____________________________________________

     John 20:21_______________________________________________

        Once Christ ascended to heaven, His church was to be a visible
     manifestation of His love and grace to the world. The disciples had
     a mission. They had a message to share. They had a task to com-
     plete. They were to carry on the work that He had begun.
        “The church is God’s appointed agency for the salvation of men.
     It was organized for service, and its mission is to carry the gos-
     pel to the world. From the beginning it has been God’s plan that
     through His church shall be reflected to the world His fullness and
     His sufficiency. The members of the church, those whom He has
     called out of darkness into His marvelous light, are to show forth
     His glory. The church is the repository of the riches of the grace of
     Christ; and through the church will eventually be made manifest,
     even to ‘the principalities and powers in heavenly places,’ the final
     and full display of the love of God. Ephesians 3:10.”—Ellen G.
     White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 9.
        The burden of Jesus’ heart is the salvation of the human race.
     The apostle Paul wrote to his young friend Timothy that it is the
     Savior’s desire that “all . . . be saved and . . . come to the knowl-
     edge of the truth” (1 Tim. 2:4, NKJV). The apostle Peter adds
     that the Lord is “longsuffering toward us, not willing that any
     should perish but that all should come to repentance” (2 Pet. 3:9,
     NKJV).

     Receiving the Promise
        The mission of sharing His love and truth with the entire world
     must have seemed overwhelming to this small group of disciples.
     The challenge was enormous, the task immense. Its accomplishment
     in their lifetime might certainly have seemed impossible (as it can
     in ours). The best estimates are that the population of the Roman
     Empire in the first century was approximately sixty to seventy mil-
     lion. According to the first chapter of Acts, 120 believers met in the
     upper room on the day of Pentecost. This is a ratio of 1 Christian to
     approximately every 500,000 to 580,000 people in the empire. From a
     human standpoint, Jesus’ command to preach the gospel to the world
     seemed unthinkable.

Read Acts 2. What were the results of the outpouring of the Holy
     Spirit on the mission of the early church?

     ________________________________________________________

       The results were astounding. The Christian church exploded in
     growth. Tens of thousands were converted. The message of Jesus’
     love was carried to the remotest parts of the empire.
       Pliny the Younger, governor of the Roman province of Bithynia
     on the northern coast of modern Turkey, wrote to Emperor Trajan
     around a.d. 110. Pliny described the official trials he was conducting
     to find and execute Christians. “Many of every age, of every social
     class, even of both sexes, are being called to trial and will be called.
     Not cities alone but villages in even rural areas have been invaded by
     the infection of this superstition” (Christianity).
       This quote is remarkable. It reveals that in a few generations
     Christianity had invaded nearly every level of society, even in the
     remote provinces.
       Ninety years later, around a.d. 200, Tertullian, a Roman lawyer
     turned Christian, wrote a defiant letter to the Roman magistrates
     defending Christianity. He boasted that “nearly all the citizens of all
     the cities are Christians.”
       The story of the book of Acts is the story of a revived church com-
     mitted to witness for its Lord. Spiritual revival always leads to pas-
     sionate witness. Sharing is the natural outgrowth of a transformed life.
     Jesus said to His disciples, “ ‘Follow Me, and I will make you fishers
     of men’ ” (Matt. 4:19). The closer we follow Jesus, the more we care
     about what He cares about. If we have little interest in sharing His
     love with others, it may be because we are following Him at a distance
     and need a personal spiritual revival.

     The Power of Personal Testimony
       Religious ritual has little power to change lives. Religious formal-
     ism leaves people spiritually barren. Doctrine alone will not transform
     hearts. The power of New Testament witnessing was rooted in the
     genuineness of lives changed by the gospel. The disciples were not
     play-acting. They were not going through the motions. Theirs was
     not some form of artificial spirituality. An encounter with the living
     Christ had changed them, and they could not be silent any longer.

What common thread runs through the experiences of Paul and
     John that made them such powerful witnesses? Acts 22:1–14, Phil.
     3:1–7, 1 John 1:1–4.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        At Pentecost the disciples were changed people. Something hap-
     pened to them so that the Spirit could do something through them.
     The Holy Spirit had done something for them so that He could do
     something with them. The Spirit overflowed from their lives to
     refresh the lives of others.
        Jesus put it this way: “ ‘He who believes in Me, as the Scripture
     has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water’ ” (John
     7:38, NKJV). The root word for “believes” in the Greek here is pis-
     tis. It means much more than a superficial belief or mere intellectual
     assent. It is a rock-solid belief or confident trust. It is a dynamic, life-
     transforming faith in Christ, who poured out His life on the cross for
     the sins of humanity. Jesus’ point is that when His love quenches our
     spiritual thirst, this love flows from our hearts to the people around
     us.
        “Our confession of His faithfulness is Heaven’s chosen agency
     for revealing Christ to the world. We are to acknowledge His grace
     as made known through the holy men of old; but that which will be
     most effectual is the testimony of our own experience. We are wit-
     nesses for God as we reveal in ourselves the working of a power that
     is divine.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 347.
        The most powerful witness is one of a Christian who knows Jesus
     personally. There is no substitute for the testimony that springs natu-
     rally from a heart immersed in Jesus’ love.
      What kind of personal testimony do you have that tells of what
      the Lord has done for you? How can you learn to share it better
      with others?

     A Witnessing Faith Is a Growing
     Faith
        Activity is a law of life. In order to be healthy, our bodies need con-
     sistent exercise. Every organ, muscle, and tissue is strengthened and
     invigorated through exercise. When we neglect exercise, our immune
     system is compromised, and we become more susceptible to disease.
        Something similar happens to us spiritually when we do not exercise
     our faith through witnessing. The words of Jesus, that “ ‘ “it is more
     blessed to give than to receive” ’ ” (Acts 20:35), work themselves out
     in our own spiritual lives. When we share God’s Word with others,
     we grow spiritually. The more we love Jesus, the more we will desire
     to witness of His love. The more we witness of His love, the more we
     will love Him. Sharing our faith strengthens our faith.

What does Jesus’ miracle of multiplying the loaves and fishes teach
     us about the sharing of our faith? John 6:1–11.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        The more that we give away our faith, the more our faith multi-
     plies. This law of multiplication is a divine principle of spiritual life.
     Give and grow, or withhold and wither. Jesus increases our faith as
     we share it with others, even if our faith is quite small. As we share
     the Bread of Life with spiritually hungry people around us, Jesus
     multiplies in our hands, and we end up with more than we started.
        When Jesus began, He had five loaves and two fish. After five
     thousand people were completely satisfied with their meal that day,
     Jesus had more left over than when He started. There were still
     twelve baskets remaining.
        Jesus’ instructions to His New Testament church are too clear to
     be misunderstood. He declared, “ ‘Freely you have received, freely
     give’ ” (Matt. 10:8, NKJV). Witnessing is the gentle breeze that
     fans the sparks of revival into Pentecostal flames. When witness and
     service do not accompany a revival of prayer and Bible study, the
     flames of revival are extinguished, and the embers soon grow cold.

      It’s true, isn’t it? The more that we witness, the more our faith
      grows. What has been your own experience with this crucial
      spiritual truth?

     Revival, Witnessing, and Divine
     Intervention
       The thrilling story of the rapid growth of New Testament Christianity
     in Acts is the story of a revived church witnessing of Jesus’ love. It is
     the story of a church that regularly experienced divine intervention.
     Witnessing was a way of life for these early believers.
       “Daily in the temple, and in every house, they did not cease teach-
     ing and preaching Jesus as the Christ” (Acts 5:42, NKJV). Persecution
     even furthered the cause of the gospel. When persecution scattered the
     members of the church at Jerusalem, they “went everywhere preach-
     ing the word” (Acts 8:4, NKJV).
       One of the more remarkable examples of divine intervention in
     Acts is the story of Philip and an Ethiopian government official.

Read the story of Philip instructing the Ethiopian and his response
     in Acts 8:26–38. What can we take from this story about revival
     and witnessing?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       “An angel guided Philip to the one who was seeking for light and
     who was ready to receive the gospel, and today angels will guide the
     footsteps of those workers who will allow the Holy Spirit to sanctify
     their tongues and refine and ennoble their hearts. The angel sent to
     Philip could himself have done the work for the Ethiopian, but this is
     not God’s way of working. It is His plan that men are to work for their
     fellow men.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 109.
       There are three essential elements in revival, and they are prayer,
     the study of God’s Word, and witnessing. When God’s people seek
     Him in earnest, heartfelt intercession, and when they saturate their
     minds with the truths of His Word, and when they passionately wit-
     ness of His love and truth to others—God divinely intervenes and
     opens unusual doors for the proclamation of truth.

      Be honest with yourself: what do you do when witnessing
      opportunities come? Do you witness, or do you find some excuse
      not to? What does your answer tell you about your own need of
      revival and reformation?

    Further Study: “In His wisdom the Lord brings those who are seek-
         ing for truth into touch with fellow beings who know the truth. It is
         the plan of Heaven that those who have received light shall impart it
         to those in darkness. Humanity, drawing its efficiency from the great
         Source of wisdom, is made the instrumentality, the working agency,
         through which the gospel exercises its transforming power on mind
         and heart.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 134.

           “God could have reached His object in saving sinners without our
         aid; but in order for us to develop a character like Christ’s, we must
         share in His work. In order to enter into His joy,—the joy of seeing
1        souls redeemed by His sacrifice,—we must participate in His labors
         for their redemption.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 142.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 What is the main idea of this week’s lesson? Are there

2         changes that God is calling you to make in your life? Do your
          priorities need to be readjusted in any way? What actions might
          God be calling you to take?

          l
          2 Dwell more on this amazing spiritual truth that the more we
          witness for our faith the more our faith grows. Why do you think
          this is true? Why does this principle make so much sense?

3         l
          3 How often do you witness for your Jesus? If not a lot, ask
          yourself, Why not? Are you afraid of rejection? If so, think
          about Jesus and how often He was rejected. If rejection didn’t
          deter Him, it shouldn’t us. Or do you fail to witness because you
          are not sure of what to say? If so, what does that tell you about
          your need for a deeper walk with the Lord?

          l
          4 During the week we talked a bit about how religious ritual
          alone cannot bring about a change of the heart. That is so true.
          At the same time, what is the place of ritual and tradition in our
          faith and church? In what ways, if any, can ritual and tradition
          be of value in revival and reformation?

          l5 Why do we get so much satisfaction from being used by God
          to reach souls for Him?

Zuri’s Hope
   Zuri, ten, lives in a village in the mountains of central Mexico. The villagers
work hard every day. But on festival days, they put aside work and eat and
drink and dance and laugh. But Zuri didn’t like the festivals. Often the men
would get drunk and would fight. Often someone got hurt. Zuri told his father
how much he hated the noise and fighting and drinking during the festivals.
   “But what can we do?” his father asked. “We live here.”
   “We could go to the [Seventh-day] Adventist church on festival days,” Zuri
suggested. “They play games, and everyone has fun, but no one drinks or gets
hurt. It’s nice.”
   “How do you know that?” Zuri’s father asked.
   “I’ve seen them,” Zuri said. Zuri didn’t tell his father that he had gone to
the church and listened to them sing or gone to the river to watch them hold
baptisms.
   Father respected Seventh-day Adventists and gave Zuri permission to
attend the Seventh-day Adventist church. The next Sabbath Zuri went to
Sabbath School. He enjoyed the children’s program and decided to go every
week. He went to weeknight programs, too, and enjoyed sitting in the front
row where he could watch the musicians play their guitars and sing.
   When the church planned a social, Zuri invited his parents to attend. They
went and enjoyed it. Then he invited them to church, and they went. They
were pleased to see how well church members treated Zuri.
   One day the pastor announced a baptism. Zuri asked the pastor if he could
be baptized. The pastor said that anyone who loves Jesus and wants to follow
Him can be baptized. Zuri ran home and told his parents what the pastor had
said. They gave Zuri permission to be baptized.
   Zuri studied the Bible with the pastor and learned what God expects His
followers to do. Zuri eagerly accepted God’s instructions and asked to be
baptized.
   On the day of the baptism Zuri hurried to the river. Often he had stood
on the bank and watched others be baptized. This day his parents stood on
the bank and watched him be baptized.
   Zuri taught his parents what he had learned about following Christ.
A few months later Zuri stood once more on the riverbank to watch his
parents be baptized.
   Today when the village holds festivals, Zuri’s family spends the day
with their Seventh-day Adventist church family. They invite others to join
them, and the church is growing.
   Our Thirteenth Sabbath Offerings have helped to build churches and
training camps in central Mexico where more people can learn what it
means to join God’s family.

          Lesson             5      *July 27–August 2


      Obedience: The Fruit of
      Revival


      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Matt. 26:69–74, Acts 5:28–32,
      6:3–10, 9:1–9, Phil. 2:5–8.

Memory Text: “The weapons of our warfare are not carnal but
      mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, casting down argu-
      ments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge
      of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of
      Christ” (2 Corinthians 10:4, 5, NKJV).



      A
               n illustration of the impact of revival on daily life can be seen
               in the Welsh Revival of 1904. Evan Roberts and some of his
               friends began earnestly praying for the outpouring of the Holy
      Spirit. They interceded, studied Scripture, and shared their faith.
        The Spirit was poured out in response. Lives were changed. In six
      months there were one hundred thousand conversions in the small
      country of Wales. The results of this revival were seen throughout the
      country. Throughout the day people flocked to churches by the thou-
      sands for prayer. The rough cursing coal miners were transformed
      into kind, courteous gentlemen. Even the pit ponies in the coal mines
      had to learn new commands because the miners were not cursing at
      them anymore! Transformed, obedient lives sprang from converted
      hearts. This is irrefutable evidence of a true revival.

*Study this week’s lesson to prepare for Sabbath, August 3.

     The Transformed Life
       Revival does not simply result in some warm, fuzzy feeling of sup-
     posed closeness to Jesus. It results in a changed life. There were times
     when the Bible writers felt extremely close to Jesus, and at other times
     they felt distant. There were times when their spirits soared in ecstasy,
     and they delighted in the joy of His presence. At other times, they did
     not feel the nearness of His presence at all.
       The results of revival are not necessarily positive feelings. They are
     a changed life. Our feelings are not the fruit of revival. Again, obedi-
     ence is. This is evident in the lives of the disciples after Pentecost.

Analyze Peter’s reactions before the Cross, after the Resurrection,
     and after Pentecost. What do you notice? What difference did
     the Cross, the Resurrection, and Pentecost make in Peter’s atti-
     tudes?

       The outpouring of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost made a dramatic
     difference in Peter’s life. It transformed him from a weak, vacillating
     believer to a faith-filled, obedient disciple. Once full of brash words
     and empty promises, Peter now became filled with faith, courage, and
     zeal for witnessing. It is a powerful example of what the Holy Spirit
     can do for anyone surrendered in faith and obedience to our Lord.

                                                                          39

     The High Cost of Obedience
       One of the early examples of faith, and the cost of faith, can be seen
     in the life of Stephen.

How is Stephen described in the following passages? Acts 6:3–10,
     7:55.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        The infilling of the Holy Spirit led the disciples to live unselfish,
     godly lives. Their faith led them to obedience. At times the spiritual
     warfare was fierce, but Jesus, their Savior and Lord, was by their side
     to strengthen their faith. They were stoned, imprisoned, burned at
     the stake, and shipwrecked. Their obedience also often came with an
     unusually high price. Many of the disciples suffered a martyr’s death.
        In Acts 7, Stephen preaches a magnificent sermon outlining the his-
     tory of Israel. He describes the experience of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,
     Joseph, Moses, David, and Solomon. Throughout his appeal, Stephen
     describes God’s faithfulness in the light of Israel’s unfaithfulness.
     Stephen concludes his sermon by charging that the religious leaders of
     Israel violated God’s covenant and resisted the influence of the Holy
     Spirit (Acts 7:51, 52).

What happened to Stephen because of His witness for Jesus? What
     does this teach us about what the cost of faithfulness can be? Acts
     7:54–60.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Stephen was obedient to the call of God and faithful to the mission
     of God, even to the point of death. Though we might not all be called
     to die for our faith, we need to be so committed to our Lord that, if we
     were called to that, we would not back off but, like Stephen, remain
     faithful to the end. It’s not out of the realm of possibility that someone
     reading these words right now will one day have to give up his or her
     life in the cause of the Lord.

      What would happen were you to face a life-threatening situa-
      tion because of your powerful witness? Though you might not
      be able now to predict what you would do, how have your past
      actions revealed the way in which you might react if one day
      you were brought into such a situation?

     When the Spirit Surprises
        Although Saul was misguided in his fierce persecution of Christians,
     he thought he was doing God’s will in confronting what he believed
     to be a fanatical sect. As Saul journeyed to Damascus to capture
     Christians and drag them back to Jerusalem, Jesus dramatically sur-
     prised him. Saul’s Damascus road experience changed not only his
     life, but it changed the world, as well.

Read the account of Paul’s conversion experience in Acts 9:1–9. Why
     did the Lord send him immediately to Ananias after this experi-
     ence? What important lesson is here for us?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       “Many have an idea that they are responsible to Christ alone for
     their light and experience, independent of His recognized followers
     on earth. Jesus is the friend of sinners, and His heart is touched with
     their woe. He has all power, both in heaven and on earth; but He
     respects the means that He has ordained for the enlightenment and
     salvation of men; He directs sinners to the church, which He has made
     a channel of light to the world.
       “When, in the midst of his blind error and prejudice, Saul was given
     a revelation of the Christ whom he was persecuting, he was placed
     in direct communication with the church, which is the light of the
     world.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 122.

How did Jesus surprise Ananias? What attitude must Ananias have
     had in order to follow the Savior’s instructions? Acts 9:10–16.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

      Try to put yourself in the position of Paul after meeting Jesus
      on the road to Damascus. What a shock to him. Also, try to put
      yourself in Ananias’ position. What a shock it must have been
      to him, as well. What do these accounts teach us about the ways
      in which we might be called by the Lord to face and do things
      that, at the time, we don’t understand? Why, though, must we
      obey the Lord regardless?

      Sensitivity to the Spirit’s Call
        Throughout his ministry, Paul was guided by the Spirit, convicted
      by the Spirit, instructed by the Spirit, and empowered by the Spirit. In
      his defense before King Agrippa, he described the heavenly vision on
      the Damascus Road. He then testified that the purpose of his ministry
      to both the Jews and Gentiles was “ ‘ “to open their eyes, in order to
      turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God,
      that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among
      those who are sanctified by faith in Me” ’ ” (Acts 26:18, NKJV).

In light of the Holy Spirit’s guidance, what is significant about the
      apostle Paul’s response to his Damascus road vision? Contrast
      Paul’s response to the call of the Holy Spirit to King Agrippa’s
      response. Acts 26:19–32.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         In direct contrast to Paul, King Agrippa did not yield to the convict-
      ing power of the Holy Spirit. His own self-inflated importance and
      egotistical desires were in conflict with the Spirit’s prompting for a
      new life in Christ.
         Jesus stated it clearly: “ ‘A little while longer the light is with you.
      Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you; he who
      walks in darkness does not know where he is going. While you have
      the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light’ ”
      (John 12:35, 36, NKJV).
         As we obediently follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit and walk
      in the light of God’s truth, He will continually reveal more light and
      truth. At the same time, too, the more that we push away the prompt-
      ing of the Holy Spirit, the more that we resist Him, the harder our
      hearts will become.

       “Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian” (Acts 26:28).
       Those are some of the most poignant, powerful, and sad words
       in all the Bible. In what ways can we be in danger of harboring
       a similar attitude? For instance, how does compromise in our
       walk with the Lord reveal the same principle that is seen in
       Agrippa’s words?

     Spirit-Led Obedience
       The Holy Spirit played a major role in every aspect of Jesus’ life.
     He was “conceived of the Holy Spirit” (NKJV) and “anointed . . .
     with the Holy Spirit and with power” (NKJV) at baptism—the birth
     of His ministry (Matt. 1:20; 3:16, 17; Acts 10:34–38). Throughout
     Christ’s life, He was obedient to the Father’s will (John 8:29, Heb.
     10:7).

Read Philippians 2:5–8. What aspects of a life filled with the Holy
     Spirit appear in this specific description of Jesus?

       He who was “in the form,” or the very essence, of God, “made
     Himself,” or as the original Greek text of the New Testament says,
     “emptied Himself ” of His privileges and prerogatives as God’s equal
     and, instead, became “a servant.”
       Jesus was a servant to the Father’s will. He “humbled Himself” and
     became “obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross”
     (Phil. 2:8). Jesus provides an example of what a life filled with the
     Holy Spirit is like. It is a life of willing obedience and humble sub-
     mission to the Father’s will. It is a prayerful life devoted to service
     and ministry, a life consumed with the passionate desire to see others
     saved in the Father’s kingdom.
       The apostle Paul declares that Spirit-filled, New Testament believ-
     ers have “received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith
     among all nations for His name” (Rom. 1:5, NKJV). The heathen, on
     the other hand, “are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey
     unrighteousness—indignation and wrath” (Rom. 2:8, NKJV).

      In Romans 6:15–23, Paul uses two contrasting expressions,
      “slaves of sin” (NKJV) and “slaves of righteousness” (NKJV). In
      Romans 8:12–17, he describes the “spirit of bondage” and the
      “Spirit of adoption.” What does your own experience with the
      Lord, with faith, with the struggle against sin, and with accep-
      tance from God tell you about the meaning of these terms?

    Further Study: “At the entrance gate of the path that leads to
         everlasting life God places faith, and He lines the whole way with the
         light and peace and joy of willing obedience. The traveler in this way
         keeps ever before him the mark of his high calling in Christ. The prize
         is ever in sight. To him God’s commands are righteousness and joy
         and peace in the Holy Spirit.”—Ellen G. White, In Heavenly Places,
         p. 183.

           “The promise of the Holy Spirit is not limited to any age or to any
         race. Christ declared that the divine influence of His Spirit was to be
         with His followers unto the end. From the Day of Pentecost to the
         present time, the Comforter has been sent to all who have yielded
         themselves fully to the Lord and to His service. To all who have
2
         accepted Christ as a personal Saviour, the Holy Spirit has come as a
         counselor, sanctifier, guide, and witness. The more closely believers
         have walked with God, the more clearly and powerfully have they
         testified of their Redeemer’s love and of His saving grace. The men
         and women, who through the long centuries of persecution and trial
         enjoyed a large measure of the presence of the Spirit in their lives,
         have stood as signs and wonders in the world. Before angels and
         men they have revealed the transforming power of redeeming love.”

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Read Acts 5:1–11. What can we learn from this powerful,
          and to some degree, frightful story? Why do you think that they
          faced such dire consequences for their actions?

          l
          2 Dwell on Thursday’s study, which talked about how Jesus
          “emptied Himself” in order to fulfill what He came here to do.
          How can we take that principle and apply it to ourselves, in our
          walk with the Lord? Why, especially, as we seek for revival and
          reformation in our lives and in the church, is this kind of self-
          denial and death to self so crucial?

A New Leaf
   Danilo paced the floor in anger. What right does Mom have to send
me away? he asked himself. She hasn’t been here for me for years.
   Danilo’s parents had divorced when he was five years old. He and
his brother lived with his father, who drank heavily. By the time
Danilo was 12, he was drinking too. Then friends offered him cocaine,
and soon he was hooked. He started selling cocaine to pay for his own
drugs. When his mother found out, she gave him an ultimatum: Go into
rehab or go to a boarding school. Fearful for her son, she took Danilo
to live far from his friends.
   Danilo stopped using drugs for a while, but when he went to live
with his dad, he started using drugs again. Danilo needed money for
drugs, and a friend suggested that they rob a pizza parlor. But the
manager recognized his friend and called the police. The boys were
arrested.
   While Danilo waited for his father to bail him out, he had time to
think about what he had done. He remembered that when he was little
his parents had taken him to church and taught him to pray. For the
first time in years Danilo prayed. “God, if You take me out of this situ-
ation, I’ll change my life.”
   The judge sentenced Danilo to probation. Danilo wanted to change
his life, so his father asked a cousin to help enroll Danilo in a Seventh-
day Adventist boarding school near the capital city of Brazil. Danilo
didn’t have money to study at the school, but his cousin helped him
to get a part-time job to help to pay his tuition. At school, he started
reading the Bible and felt God drawing him to Himself.
   Danilo enjoyed his studies and made the best of his second chance.
He has given his life to Jesus and is thrilled to know that God is chang-
ing his life one day at a time. “I feel free now, freer than I’ve ever felt.
There’s no high like the high I get from praising God,” he says.
   The school sponsors several outreach activities, and Danilo enjoys
sharing his new faith with others, especially his parents and brother.
He prays that one day the family will be united in Christ, who is chang-
ing him completely.
   Our mission offerings help to establish and strengthen Seventh-day
Adventist schools where young people’s lives can change forever. Part
of a recent Thirteenth Sabbath Offering is helping to build a church on
the campus of Central Brazil Adventist Academy, where Danilo stud-
ies and is preparing to become a leader for God. Thank you.

          Lesson            6      *August 3–9


      Confession and Repentance:
      The Conditions of Revival




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Acts 5:30–32, 2 Cor. 7:9–11,
      Lev. 5:5, 1 John 1:9, Heb. 12:17, Ps. 32:1–8.

Memory Text: “He who covers his sins will not prosper, but who-
      ever confesses and forsakes them will have mercy” (Proverbs
      28:13, NKJV).



      T
             hroughout Scripture, both repentance and confession have pre-
             pared the way for spiritual revival. God has always prepared
             His people to do a great work for Him by leading them to godly
      sorrow for their sins. Once we acknowledge our sins and confess
      them, we are on track to have victory over them.
        “The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men
      count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any
      should perish, but that all should come to repentance” (2 Pet. 3:9).
      Repentance and confession are two prerequisites needed in order for
      us to receive the Spirit’s power in abundance.
        In this week’s lesson, we will trace the importance of true repen-
      tance in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit as it is revealed in the book
      of Acts. We will also contrast true repentance with false repentance.
      Most of all, we will discover that repentance is a gift that the Holy
      Spirit gives in order to help us to reflect Jesus’ love to those around
      us.

     Repentance: God’s Gift
       During the weeks before Pentecost, the disciples earnestly sought
     God in prayer. Acts 1:14 says that they were in “one accord in prayer
     and supplication.” This experience of “one accord” reveals a strong
     unity and harmony among Christ’s followers that would not have
     been possible without repentance and confession. Prayer and confes-
     sion prepared them for what was going to come.

Read Acts 5:30–32. What important points can we take from what
     Peter said here?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Peter makes two critical points. First, repentance is a gift. As we
     open our hearts to the promptings of the Holy Spirit, Jesus gives us the
     gift of repentance. Second, the disciples themselves were witnesses in
     their own lives of the reality of repentance. They not only preached
     repentance, they experienced it.
        “As the disciples waited for the fulfillment of the promise, they
     humbled their hearts in true repentance and confessed their unbelief.
     As they called to remembrance the words that Christ had spoken to
     them before His death they understood more fully their meaning. . . .
     As they meditated upon His pure, holy life they felt that no toil would
     be too hard, no sacrifice too great, if only they could bear witness in
     their lives to the loveliness of Christ’s character.”—Ellen G. White,
     The Acts of the Apostles, p. 36.
        Repentance and confession are common themes throughout Acts
     (Acts 17:30, 31; 26:19, 20). It is “the goodness of God” that leads us
     to repentance; it is the convicting power of the Holy Spirit that brings
     us to the realization of our need for a sin-pardoning Savior. At the
     same time, we must remember that the Holy Spirit does not fill unre-
     pentant hearts (Rom. 2:8; Acts 2:38, 39; 3:19). The Holy Spirit fills
     hearts emptied of selfish ambition, of the desire for personal recogni-
     tion, and of the drive for personal glory.

      Why is it so difficult to acknowledge our sins and repent of
      them? Why is it so easy to let self get in the way of true repen-
      tance?

     True Repentance Defined
How does the apostle Paul describe true repentance? 2 Cor. 7:9–11.
     ________________________________________________________
     ________________________________________________________
     ________________________________________________________

        Repentance is a God-initiated sorrow for sin. It also includes a
     decision to forsake whatever specific sins that the Holy Spirit brings
     to mind (Ezek. 14:6, Zech. 1:4). Genuine repentance does not lead
     Christians into a state of deep depression because of their sinful
     natures or deeds. “Godly sorrow produces repentance leading to sal-
     vation” (2 Cor. 7:10, NKJV). It leads us, instead, to focus on Jesus’
     righteousness, not our sinfulness. It produces a “diligence” in “look-
     ing unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith” (2 Cor. 7:11, Heb.
     12:2).
        Throughout the New Testament, we see that the enormity of our
     sin is never greater than the enormity of His grace. For “where sin
     abounded, grace abounded much more” (Rom. 5:20, NKJV). This was
     certainly true in the apostle Paul’s experience.

Read 1 Timothy 1:14–17 and Acts 26:10–16. What do these passages
     tell you about Paul’s sinfulness and Jesus’ righteousness?
     ________________________________________________________
     ________________________________________________________
     ________________________________________________________

        When the apostle Paul realized that he was persecuting the Lord of
     glory, he was driven to his knees in genuine repentance and confes-
     sion. Throughout his entire life he never tired of telling the story of his
     own sinfulness and God’s grace. His repentance did not leave him in a
     state of depression; instead, it drove him into the arms of an all-loving
     and forgiving Savior. The confession of his sin did not leave him feel-
     ing guiltier than before. His focus was not on how unrighteous he was
     but on how righteous Jesus was.

      Have you ever felt that you were the “chief” of sinners? Or, if
      not the chief, still too sinful to be saved? How can you learn to
      rest in the assurance that Christ’s righteousness is enough to
      save you?

      True Repentance and Confession
What spiritual principles do we learn from Leviticus 5:5; 1 John 1:9;
      Isaiah 1:16–18; and Acts 26:19, 20 regarding the nature of true
      repentance and confession?
      ________________________________________________________
      ________________________________________________________
      ________________________________________________________

         Genuine repentance is always accompanied by confession of spe-
      cific sins. The Holy Spirit does not give us vague feelings of guilt. He
      convicts us of our definite shortcomings.
         “True confession is always of a specific character, and acknowl-
      edges particular sins. They may be of such a nature as to be brought
      before God only; they may be wrongs that should be confessed to
      individuals who have suffered injury through them; or they may be
      of a public character, and should then be as publicly confessed. But
      all confession should be definite and to the point, acknowledging the
      very sins of which you are guilty.”—Ellen G. White, Steps to Christ,
      p. 38.
         The purpose of the convicting power of the Holy Spirit is to reveal
      our need of the saving grace of Christ. Repentance does not make
      God love us more; rather, it enables us to appreciate His love more.
      Confession does not earn God’s forgiveness; it instead enables us to
      receive His forgiveness. God does not love us more when we repent
      or love us less when we fail 10. His love for us is constant. The only
      variable is our response to the working of the Holy Spirit in our
      lives.
         The truth is that our hearts are hindered from receiving the abundant
      blessings that God has for us while our spiritual arteries are clogged
      with the sludge of sin. Sin deadens us to the Spirit’s prompting and
      makes it harder for us to respond to Him. Repentance and confes-
      sion open the clogged channels of our spiritual hearts so that we may
      receive the overflowing of the Holy Spirit’s presence and power.

       However much we long for forgiveness when we confess and
       repent, we must remember that this is a two-way street. That
       is, how do we respond to those who have treated us wrongly
       and who ask for forgiveness? Who, though totally undeserving
       of our forgiveness, do we need to forgive anyway, and why is it
       so important for us to forgive?

     True and False Repentance
     Contrasted
       There are some very specific examples in the Bible of people who
     sought repentance but were not forgiven by God. They wept. They
     were sorrowful. They confessed their sin but were not forgiven. Read
     the accounts of Pharaoh, Balaam, Esau, and Judas in Exodus 12:29–32,
     Numbers 22:32–35, Hebrews 12:17, and Matthew 27:4.

What common thread do you see running through each story in
     regard to repentance and/or confession?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

         One phrase in Hebrews 12:17 sums it up well. Speaking of Esau,
     the passage says that “when he wanted to inherit the blessing” (NKJV)
     he repented. Like Pharaoh, Balaam, and Judas, Esau’s heart was not
     broken over the pain that his sin had brought to his family or to the
     heart of God. His concern was over the birthright he had lost. He was
     sorry that he had not received that which he believed to be rightfully
     his. His motives were not pure. His sorrow was for himself. False
     repentance focuses upon the consequences of sin as opposed to the
     sin itself.
        The law of sowing and reaping is a divine law. It is true that sin
     brings dire consequences, but repentance is not consumed with the
     negative results of sin. It is concerned, instead, with the dishonor and
     sorrow that our sin has brought to God.
        True repentance is always characterized by at least three things:
     First, a sorrow that our sin has broken God’s heart. We are hurt
     because we hurt the One who loves us so much. Second, there is an
     honest confession of the specific sin that we have committed. True
     repentance is not laced with excuses for our behavior. It does not
     place blame on someone else. It takes responsibility for our actions.
     Third, true repentance always includes the decision to turn away from
     our sin. There can be no genuine repentance unless there is a corre-
     sponding reformation in the life. False repentance, on the other hand,
     is self-centered. It is concerned with the consequences of our sin. It
     is an emotional state of sorrow because our sins often bring negative
     consequences. It makes excuses and lays the blame on someone else.
     It is unconcerned about the changing of behavior unless the change
     will personally bring its own rewards.

     Confession’s Healing Power
       Confession lances the boil of guilt and allows the poisonous pus of
     sin to drain. Confession is healing in many ways. It opens our hearts
     to receive God’s grace. Through confession we accept the forgive-
     ness that Christ freely offers us from the Cross. Confession is healing
     because it allows us to receive grace. Confession also breaks down
     barriers between us and other people. It heals relationships.

Read Psalm 32:1–8. What does this teach us about confession and
     repentance?

     ________________________________________________________

Read Acts 24:16. The apostle Paul strove for a “conscience void to
     offence toward God, and toward men.” What does that mean?

     ________________________________________________________

        Is guilt good or bad? It all depends. If the Holy Spirit convicts us
     of sin, and the guilt of that sin drives us to Jesus, guilt is good. If we
     have already confessed our sin and continue to feel guilty, the guilt
     may become destructive. “This feeling of guiltiness must be laid at the
     foot of the cross of Calvary. The sense of sinfulness has poisoned the
     springs of life and of true happiness. Now Jesus says, ‘Lay it all on
     Me. I will take your sins. I will give you peace. Banish no longer your
     self-respect, for I have bought you with the price of My own blood.
     You are mine. Your weakened will I will strengthen; your remorse for
     sin I will remove.’ ”—Ellen G. White, Manuscript Releases, vol. 9,
     p. 305. The answer to guilt is Jesus. His grace abolishes the destruc-
     tive guilt sin lays upon us.
        There are times we may have confessed our sins and we still feel
     guilty. Why? One reason might be that the devil is attempting to rob
     us of the assurance of salvation. He loves to steal away the blessed
     assurance of forgiveness and salvation that we have in Jesus. Second,
     the Holy Spirit may be pointing out something that exists between
     us and another individual. If we have hurt another individual, our
     troubled conscience will be eased when we confess our wrong to the
     person whom we have hurt.

      How has guilt impacted your relationship with the Lord and
      with others? What can you do to help to alleviate the burden
      of guilt that you carry? Even if you have done wrong and the
      guilt is in a sense justified, what promises can you claim from
      the Bible to help you to move on?

                                                                           51
                       F riday August 9

    Further Study: “Confession will not be acceptable to God without
         sincere repentance and reformation. There must be decided changes
         in the life; everything offensive to God must be put away. This will
         be the result of genuine sorrow for sin. The work that we have to
         do on our part is plainly set before us: ‘Wash you, make you clean;
1
         put away the evil of your doings from before Mine eyes; cease to do
         evil; learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the
         fatherless, plead for the widow.’ Isaiah 1:16, 17. ‘If the wicked restore
         the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the statutes of life,
         without committing iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die.’
         Ezekiel 33:15.”—Ellen G. White, Steps to Christ, p. 39.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 What crucial lesson about forgiveness can we learn from
          Jesus’ willingness to forgive those who nailed Him to the cross?
          If He was willing to do that, how much more so should we be
          willing to forgive those who have hurt us?

          l
          2 In your own experience, how has confession of sin been a
3         blessing to you? In what ways has it helped you in your relation-
          ship, not only with the Lord but with others?

          l3 Though we read this week about the need, at times, to confess
          to other people whom we have wronged, why must we always be
          very careful in what we say to others?

          l4 True repentance, we have read, includes a putting away of
          sin. What happens, however, if we—struggling with that sin—
          fall into it again? Does that mean our repentance wasn’t sincere?
          Does it mean we cannot be forgiven for it again? If this were
          true, what hope would any of us have? How are we to under-
          stand the nature of biblical repentance while always keeping in
          mind the reality of our sinful natures?

          l5 From what we have studied this week, why is repentance a
          vital component in the whole issue of revival and reformation?
          How do the terms revival and reformation contain within them-
          selves the idea that we do need to repent?

The Newspaper Ad
   Alexei scanned the classified ads of his local newspaper in Siberia,
Russia. He wanted to be sure that his ad for home improvements was
attractive and his prices competitive. His eyes fell on the religious section
of classified ads. The ads there offered to tell people’s fortunes or read their
palms. So many ads for Satan, and not one for Christ, Alexei thought. He
grabbed a paper and scribbled the words “I will tell you about Christ” and
he added his telephone number. The next day he placed the ad in the paper.
   His phone began ringing. Most callers had their own advertisements in
the paper and wanted to know what Alexei would tell people about Christ.
Some wanted to argue theology. Alexei wondered whether his advertise-
ment would reach anyone who was searching for God.
   The phone rang again, and Alexei offered a cheerful “Hello.”
   “I want to know about Christ,” a weathered voice said. The men spoke for
several minutes, then the caller invited Alexei to visit him.
   An elderly man answered Alexei’s knock. The two men talked several
minutes, and then the older man said, “I’m old, and I’m not well. I want to
know about God while I have time.” Alexei opened his Bible and read several
verses about God. Then they watched an evangelistic video. For 10 days the
two studied God’s Word together. Alexei’s new friend is eager to learn more.
   Normally Alexei doesn’t answer his phone on Sabbath because most
calls are about work. But recently he received several calls from the same
person on Sabbath. Maybe it’s an emergency, Alexei thought. He answered
the phone.
   “Are you a Christian?” a young man asked. Alexi answered his question.
“I’m Vitaly,” the caller said. “I just got out of prison, and I need to talk to
you.”
   The two met, and Vitaly told Alexei that while he was in prison, a
Seventh-day Adventist woman had sent him The Great Controversy. He
had read it and wanted to know more about God. Then he found Alexei’s
newspaper advertisement.
   Vitaly now attends the Seventh-day Adventist church and is eager to
know God personally. “I know that Alexei’s advertisement was God calling
me,” Vitaly says.
   Alexei now knows that God called him to place that ad in the paper.
“People are searching for spiritual insight; I want to introduce them to
Jesus.”
   God uses simple things to draw people to Him. Our prayers and our
mission offerings strengthen God’s work around the world. Our own min-
istry strengthens God’s work at home. What ministry has God given you?
Alexei continues sharing his faith in Krasnoyarsk, Russia, where part of a recent
Thirteenth Sabbath Offering is helping to build a new church for a growing congregation.

      Unity: The Bond of
      Revival


      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: John 17:9–11, 20–24; 1 Cor.
      12:12–18; Acts 4:32, 33; 1:8; 15:1–31; Matt. 18:16–20.

Memory Text: “I, therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you
      to have a walk worthy of the calling with which you were called,
      with all lowliness and gentleness, with longsuffering, bearing with
      one another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in
      the bond of peace” (Ephesians 4:1–3, NKJV).



      U
              nity is an essential ingredient of revival. Conflict, division,
              and strife do not create an environment for nurturing revival.
              At Pentecost, the Holy Spirit was poured out on a church that
      had united in Christ’s mission to the world. Their petty differences
      were subordinate to the call of Christ’s larger mission. Striving for
      supremacy ceased in the light of Christ’s commission to reach the
      lost with the gospel. If the early followers of Christ were busy vying
      for power, the work would have been stymied from the start. Instead,
      convicted by the Holy Spirit to die to self, they were united in purpose
      and mission.
        In short, where there is no unity, there can be no revival. Where
      jealousy, envy, and jostling for supremacy reign, the Holy Spirit’s
      power is withheld. How crucial, then, that we learn how to break
      down the barriers that sometimes separate us so that we can enter into
      the unity that Christ seeks for His church.

     Answering Christ’s Prayer for Unity
      John 17 contains Jesus’ great intercessory prayer. It reveals what
     was on His mind at that momentous hour of earth’s history.

Read John 17:9–11, 20–24. What was Jesus’ heartfelt longing? Why
     was this so important? How did the disciples’ relationship to one
     another demonstrate genuine Christian faith? See Acts 4:32, 33.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        The “oneness,” or unity, of the disciples prepared their hearts for the
     reception of the fullness of the Holy Spirit’s power. Christ’s prayer
     for His church was fulfilled. They surrendered their differences. Love
     prevailed. Strife was banished.
        “Now the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and
     one soul; neither did anyone say that any of the things he possessed
     was his own, but they had all things in common. And with great
     power the apostles gave witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.
     And great grace was upon them all” (Acts 4:32, 33, NKJV).
        This passage links the disciples having “one heart and one soul”
     with their “great power” in witnessing. In the challenging circum-
     stances of first-century Jerusalem at a time when Christianity was
     unpopular, these committed Christians shared their resources. They
     supported one another. They laid aside their personal ambitions. Their
     unselfish attitudes and generosity of spirit prepared them to receive
     the fullness of the Holy Spirit’s power for witnessing.
        “Notice that it was after the disciples had come into perfect unity,
     when they were no longer striving for the highest place that the Spirit
     was poured out. They were of one accord. All differences had been put
     away.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8, p. 20.

      Why is the fulfillment of Jesus’ prayer in John 17 so important
      for our church? What does Jesus’ desire for the unity of the
      first-century church reveal about His desire for our church
      today?

     New Testament Illustrations of Unity
        The New Testament world of the first century was divided by
     caste, social status, and gender. It was a society in social turmoil. The
     concepts of equal rights, freedom, and human dignity were not the
     accepted norms.
        Then Christianity burst upon the scene. It created a social revolu-
     tion. Jesus’ teachings of equality, justice, concern for the poor, and
     respect for the marginalized appeared radical. At the same time, New
     Testament believers united around the core values of Creation and
     Redemption. They taught that all human beings were created by God
     and that Redemption was made available to all people through the
     cross of Christ. The Cross showed that each person, regardless of his
     or her worldly status, was of immense value in God’s sight.

How do the following images illustrate the way in which different
     believers, regardless of their backgrounds, blend into a harmoni-
     ous whole? 1 Cor. 12:12–18; 1 Pet. 2:4, 5.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        What images could be more powerful to illustrate unity in the
     church? The apostle Paul uses the body to illustrate the church and
     its members. The body is closely knit. Its members are interrelated
     and mutually dependent upon one another. All parts have their func-
     tion. If one part of the body suffers, the entire body suffers (1 Cor.
     12:18–26).
        Peter adds the illustration of a spiritual building with the members
     as stones, each fitting perfectly into the construction of a glorious
     temple that will glorify Jesus’ name. In these illustrations, each mem-
     ber is intimately linked. It was this bond of loving unity in a world
     of fractured relationships, power struggles, and divisive schisms that
     was to be a powerful argument for Christianity. Jesus stated this uni-
     versal truth clearly: “By this all will know that you are My disciples,
     if you have love for one another” (John 13:34, 35, NKJV).

      How well does your local church reflect the unity spoken about
      here? Ask yourself, too: are you helping to bring unity, or what
      attitudes might you be harboring that could be adding to the
      problem?

     Elements of Unity: Our Mission and
     Message
       The unity experienced by the New Testament believers was based
     on far more than emotional warmth between members.

Read Acts 1:8, 4:33, 5:42, 9:31, and 28:28–31. What was the all-
     consuming passion of the New Testament church? How did this
     passion unite them?
     ________________________________________________________
     ________________________________________________________

        The disciples were consumed with something much larger than
     themselves. Christ’s commission to take the gospel to the entire world
     swallowed up their personal ambitions. The church cannot reach the
     community with the gospel until it is united, but it will never be united
     until it is consumed with the preaching of the gospel.
        Mission is a great unifying factor. The early believers rallied around
     mission. The life, death, resurrection, priestly ministry, and return of
     our Lord bound them together. New converts were anchored in the
     “apostles’ doctrine” (Acts 2:41, 42, NKJV). The teachings of Jesus
     provided the foundation for their unity.
        The apostle Peter uses the term “present truth” (2 Pet. 1:12). The
     message of “present truth” in Peter’s day united the church and pro-
     pelled it forward with a prophetic impetus: Jesus Christ of Nazareth
     was the fulfillment of the Messianic prophecies of the Old Testament.
     They were united with an urgent, present-truth message regarding the
     fulfillment of prophecy.
        Now, in the final days of earth’s history, God has given His people
     an urgent, present-truth message, as well (Rev. 14:6–12). It is the
     message of “the everlasting gospel” in the context of judgment, of
     obedience, and of the Lord’s return. This is what unites Seventh-day
     Adventists as a worldwide family. If this message was watered down,
     given a secondary place, or treated as a relic of the past, the unity of
     the church would be fractured, and its mission would lose its urgency.
     If the church’s message is either misunderstood or distorted, its mis-
     sion will be unclear. It is the proclamation of the prophetic message
     of the Three Angels that gives Seventh-day Adventists the reason for
     our existence.

      How connected are you with our message and mission? Or look
      at it this way: why are you a Seventh-day Adventist? Bring
      your answer to class on Sabbath.

     Church Organization: The Structure
     for Unity
        The New Testament reveals that the early church had a definite
     organizational structure. This structure helped to preserve the doc-
     trinal purity of the church and keep it focused on mission.
        In Acts 6, a small group of disciples met together to solve the
     problem of the distribution of food to the widows of the Greek con-
     verts. They selected deacons to solve the dilemma. Church members
     respected the authority of these church leaders.
        When the apostle Paul was converted on the Damascus Road,
     he was directed to Ananias, a representative of the church (Acts
     9:10–17).
        After Paul’s baptism by Ananias, the Holy Spirit directed him to
     meet with the leaders of the church in Jerusalem in order to confirm
     his ministry (Acts 9:26–30).
        In Acts 20 Paul met with the church elders from Ephesus to urge
     them to be on guard against false teachers and their heresies (Acts
     20:17, 27–32).

How did the New Testament church solve a major dispute over cir-
     cumcision? Acts 15:1–31.
     ________________________________________________________
     ________________________________________________________
     ________________________________________________________

        The Jerusalem Council saved the first-century church from a seri-
     ous schism. Church organization with administrative authority was
     essential in preserving the doctrinal integrity of the New Testament
     church. In this instance, local church representatives were sent to
     Jerusalem to participate in doctrinal discussions, which would have
     serious implications for the future of the church. Once this represen-
     tative group came to a consensus, they wrote out their decision in a
     committee action and circulated it throughout the churches where the
     problem had originated: Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia (Acts 15:23).
        Members accepted the decision of the Jerusalem Council and
     rejoiced that the Holy Spirit had guided them to an answer to their
     dilemma (Acts 15:30–35).
      If you are a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, then
      you are involved in the church structure. What is your role
      in that structure, and how might you be more constructively
      involved?

     Achieving Unity
        The closer we come to Jesus, the closer we come to one another.
     We see with new spiritual eyesight. The Spirit of Christ enables us
     to view one another differently. The little things that once bothered
     us are reframed by the grace of Christ. Cherished hostilities are relin-
     quished in the light of His magnificent grace. Old scores and disputes
     are, as much as possible, set aside. Barriers are broken down. The
     gospel heals broken relationships.
        When the Holy Spirit was poured out in its fullness on Pentecost,
     the attitudes of the disciples toward one another were dramatically
     changed. In the light streaming from the Cross, they saw one another
     differently.
        “Every Christian saw in his brother a revelation of divine love and
     benevolence. One interest prevailed; one subject of emulation swal-
     lowed up all others. The ambition of the believers was to reveal the
     likeness of Christ’s character and to labor for the enlargement of His
     kingdom.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 48.

List some of the practices that fostered unity among first-century
     Christians. Why are these practices so powerful in bringing
     believers together? Matt. 18:16–20; Acts 1:14; 12:5, 12; 6:7; Matt.
     28:16–20.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Hoping or wishing for unity does not bring it about. The New
     Testament church prayed together and talked together. They studied
     God’s Word together, and together they shared their faith. Prayer, Bible
     study, and witnessing are powerful elements that create, foster, and sus-
     tain the unity of the church. As we pray for one another, we are drawn
     closer together. Participating in an evangelistic outreach to the com-
     munity creates a sense of oneness or togetherness. A living, dynamic,
     unified, and revived church is one whose members are praying together,
     studying God’s Word, and reaching out to their community.

      What are some of the forces at play that threaten the unity of
      your local church, or even the church as a whole? Why is it
      important to understand what these forces are and to be ready
      to deal with them?

    Further Study: “In these first disciples was presented marked diversity.
          They were to be the world’s teachers, and they represented widely
          varied types of character. In order successfully to carry forward the
          work to which they had been called, these men, differing in natural
          characteristics and in habits of life, needed to come into unity of feel-
          ing, thought, and action. This unity it was Christ’s object to secure.
          To this end He sought to bring them into unity with Himself.”—Ellen
          G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 20.

    Discussion Questions:
           l
           1 Why is a unified church structure so important for us? What
           would happen to our mission, to our message, and to our church
           as a whole if congregations, conferences, unions, or divisions
           were to go their own way? Imagine the chaos that would ensue.
2
           l
           2 In class, answer the question: Why am I a Seventh-day
           Adventist?

           l
           3 However important unity is for the church, are there some
           things that are even more important? If so, what? For instance,
           in dealing with those who preached doctrines with which he
           disagreed, Paul wrote this: “But though we, or an angel from
3
           heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we
           have preached unto you, let him be accursed. As we said before,
           so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you
           than that ye have received, let him be accursed” (Gal. 1:8, 9).
           What happened to unity here, at least with these people?

           l
           4 Dwell more on the issue of how our message and mission are
           crucial to our whole identity as Seventh-day Adventists. After
           all, what would our purpose be without our message, which no
           one else is preaching to the world? At the same time, what other
           things unite us as Seventh-day Adventists? That is, though we
           would have nothing were it not for our mission and message,
           what else do we have that helps to define us, and why are these
           important, as well?

           l
           5 Why is unity so crucial for any revival and reformation
           among us?

The Disobedient Daughter
   Irunga stepped outside the mud hut that was her father’s home. She had
hoped that he would understand that becoming a Christian didn’t mean
she was rejecting her family’s traditions. She loved her family, but now
God was more important.
   Irunga is a Herero, a tribal people living in northern Namibia. She grew
up watching her grandfather sit before the holy fire and talk to the ances-
tors, asking them to tell God the family’s concerns.
   When she was ten years old, she went to live with her uncle and attend
school in the little town nearest to her family’s settlement. While study-
ing, she attended a Protestant church and accepted Jesus as her Savior.
She knew that her family would be unhappy, but when her grandfather
accused her of deserting their culture, she was deeply hurt. They called her
a disobedient daughter. Saddened, Irunga returned to town.
   A friend introduced her to some Seventh-day Adventist missionaries and
their interpreter, Kapitango. Irunga enjoyed talking with the missionaries,
but she had no intention of becoming a Seventh-day Adventist. However, as
her friendship with Kapitango grew, so did her interest in his faith. In time
she accepted the Seventh-day Adventist faith, and the young couple decided
to marry. But marriage in Irunga’s culture is complicated, and parents often
take years to decide to allow their young people to marry.
   Kapitango’s parents asked Irunga’s parents for permission for the cou-
ple to marry, and they agreed. But just before the wedding, they withdrew
their permission. Kapitango and Irunga decided to marry anyway.
   Religion continues to be a wedge between Irunga and her family, who
still refuse to listen to her testimony. But Irunga hopes that one day they will
share her love for Jesus. She is her village’s only contact with Seventh-day
Adventists.
   Irunga and her pastor-husband work with a group of Seventh-day
Adventist missionaries to reach the Herero and Himba people of Namibia.
They are developing Bible stories told in the oral traditions of her people.
The stories, recorded onto MP3 players, are making a difference in people’s
lives, and Irunga hopes that one day soon they will reach her own family.
   Part of a recent Thirteenth Sabbath Offering has gone to help make
these MP3 players available to more Himba and Herero people so that
they can hear for themselves that God is not distant or uncaring but loving
and forgiving.
   Thank you for giving to missions and the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering and
making it possible for others to hear the story of salvation for themselves.

Irunga Ndjamba shares her faith in northern Namibia.

Read for This Week’s Study: John 17:3; 1 John 2:3–6;
      Matt. 23:27, 28; 2 Thess. 2:9–12; 1 Cor. 12:4–7.

Memory Text: “Consider how I love Your precepts; revive me,
      O Lord, according to Your lovingkindness. The entirety of
      Your word is truth, and every one of Your righteous judgments
      endures forever” (Psalm 119:159, 160, NKJV).



      E
             arly in my ministry I studied with a family in rural Tennessee.
             One day a large man walked into the room smoking a big
             cigar. He then declared that the Lord had healed him from lung
      cancer!
        I have reflected upon this experience often. This man sincerely
      believed that the Holy Spirit had miraculously healed him. However,
      did his belief that he was healed make it true? Are signs and wonders
      always evidence of the Holy Spirit’s working? Can we base our faith
      on signs and wonders alone? What role might signs and wonders have
      in a false revival?
        In the context of revival, we need to ask, Is it possible that the devil
      can create a false religious excitement and leave the impression that a
      genuine revival has occurred?
        This week we will study the spiritual indicators of genuine revival
      and contrast them with the obvious signs of false ones. Knowing the
      difference between the two will help to save us from the enemy’s
      delusions.

     God’s Will and His Word
        All true spirituality is focused on knowing God and doing His will
     (John 17:3, Heb. 10:7). Any so-called “revival” that focuses on expe-
     rience rather than commitment to obey God’s Word misses the mark
     completely. The Holy Spirit will never lead us where God’s Word
     does not. The Holy Spirit leads us into the Word (2 Tim. 3:15, 16).
     The Word of God is the foundation and heart of all true revival.

What do the following passages in Psalm 119 reveal about revival
     and God’s Word? List all the spiritual qualities that God’s Word
     develops in our lives. Ps. 119:25, 28, 49, 50, 67, 81, 105, 116, 130,
     154. What do these promises mean in practical terms in our expe-
     rience with the Lord?

       In Jesus’ sermon about the Bread of Life, He explained the
     essence of all revival and the foundation of all spiritual life. He
     declared, “ ‘It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing.
     The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life’ ” (John
     6:63, NKJV). Jesus’ statement is extremely significant. The Holy
     Spirit, who is the Source of all spiritual revival, speaks through
     God’s Word in order to give to those who grasp it by faith a deep
     spiritual life. Revival occurs when the Holy Spirit impresses Jesus’
     words upon our minds. This is why the Savior said, “ ‘ “Man shall
     not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the
     mouth of God” ’ ” (Matt. 4:4, NKJV).
       “In many of the revivals which have occurred during the last half
     century, the same influences have been at work, to a greater or less
     degree, that will be manifest in the more extensive movements of the
     future. There is an emotional excitement, a mingling of the true with
     the false, that is well adapted to mislead. Yet none need be deceived.
     In the light of God’s word it is not difficult to determine the nature
     of these movements. Wherever men neglect the testimony of the
     Bible, turning away from those plain, soul-testing truths which
     require self-denial and renunciation of the world, there we may be
     sure that God’s blessing is not bestowed.”—Ellen G. White, The
     Great Controversy, p. 464.
       The essence of true revival is discovering God’s will as manifest in
     God’s Word. Jesus lived a life filled with the Holy Spirit. From His
     birth to His death, He was led and empowered by the Holy Spirit.
                                                                         65

     God’s Love and His Law
        Revival is all about knowing Jesus. It is a reawakening of the spiri-
     tual faculties of the soul. It is a personal and vital experience with
     the Savior. Knowing Jesus—really knowing Him as a friend—is the
     essence of all revival. From the depth of his personal experience with
     Jesus, the apostle Paul shared that he is praying for the Ephesians to
     “know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be
     filled with all the fullness of God” (Eph. 3:19, NKJV).
        This is in contrast to the story of the end-time virgins, five of whom
     had an outer form of godliness and religion but lacked an intimate
     experience with Jesus. Referring to their great need, Jesus said,
     “ ‘Assuredly, I say to you, I do not know you’ ” (Matt. 25:12, NKJV).
        Knowing God always leads to obedience. God’s law reveals His
     love. A deeper relationship with Christ leads to a greater desire to
     please Christ. Obedience is the fruit of love. The more we love Him,
     the more we will desire to obey Him. Any so-called revival that does
     not emphasize repentance for the times that we have willfully broken
     His law is suspect. Religious fervor may stimulate a temporary reli-
     gious high, but lasting spiritual change will be lacking.

For the apostle John, what are the evidences that one really knows
     God? 1 John 2:3–6; 4:7, 8, 20, 21.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       In these passages John makes two crucial points. First, knowing
     God leads to keeping His commandments. Second, loving God leads
     to loving one another. John’s point is clear. Genuine spirituality
     results in a changed life. The heart of revival is not a warm sensation
     of feeling close to Jesus. It is a transformed life filled with the joy
     of serving Jesus. God’s great goal in all revivals is to draw us closer
     to Him, to deepen our surrender to His purpose for our lives, and to
     release us for witness and ministry in His cause.

      How are you in your own personal relationships? What do
      those relationships tell you about your own walk with the Lord?
      In what ways might you need to progress in both your relation-
      ship with God and with others?

     Formalism, Fanaticism, and Faith
        One of the challenges of true revival is breaking through the icy
     surface of cold formalism while at the same time avoiding the fiery
     flames of fanaticism. Formalism is rigidly locked in the status quo. It
     is satisfied with the external husks of religion while it denies the liv-
     ing reality of faith. Fanaticism tends to go to extremes. It goes off on
     religious tangents. It tends to be unbalanced, focusing on one aspect
     of faith to the neglect of all others. Fanaticism is often self-righteous
     and judgmental. The apostle Paul longed that the Christian church
     “no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every
     wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of
     deceitful plotting” (Eph. 4:14, NKJV).

What do we learn about cold formalism in Jesus’ condemnation of
     the Pharisees? Matt. 23:27, 28; Luke 11:39, 40; Mark 7:5–9.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

What do we learn about those who thought that signs and wonders
     proved that they were Jesus’ faithful followers? Matt. 7:21–23.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       The deeper issue in both of these experiences is the commitment
     of the heart. Signs and wonders can never take the place of authentic
     biblical faith. They are not substitutes for surrendering to the will and
     Word of God. The essence of real revival is a faith so deep that it leads
     to an obedient life that is committed to do God’s will. A biblically
     based revival echoes John’s words, “For whatever is born of God
     overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the
     world—our faith” (1 John 5:4, NKJV).
       “What kind of faith is it that overcomes the world? It is that faith
     which makes Christ your own personal Saviour—that faith which,
     recognizing your helplessness, your utter inability to save yourself,
     takes hold of the Helper who is mighty to save, as your only hope.”
     —Ellen G. White, Reflecting Christ, p. 21.

      Which side do you tend to lean toward: formalism and tradi-
      tion or experience and excitement? If, perhaps, you lean too
      much toward one side or the other, how can you find the right
      balance?

                                                                          67

     Ministry and Miracles
        False revivals often place their major emphasis on miracles.
     Genuine revivals focus on ministry. False revivals emphasize spec-
     tacular signs and wonders; genuine revivals recognize that the great-
     est miracle is a changed life.
        The healing miracles of Jesus testified to the fact that He was the
     Messiah. As our compassionate Redeemer, the Savior was concerned
     with alleviating human suffering. But He was even more concerned with
     the salvation of everyone whom He touched with His healing grace.
     The purpose of Jesus’ redemptive ministry was to “seek and save” lost
     humankind (Luke 19:10). Speaking to the religious leaders regarding
     the paralytic, Jesus declared, “ ‘But that you may know that the Son of
     Man has power on earth to forgive sins’ ”—then He said to the paralytic,
     “ ‘Arise, take up your bed and go to your house’ ” (Matt. 9:6, NKJV).
     The crowd’s response to this miracle was to glorify God (Matt. 9:8).
        Miracles were an outgrowth of Jesus’ redemptive ministry, but they
     were not the main reason He came to earth.

What can we learn from these texts about how people can be deceived
     in the last days? 2 Thess. 2:9–12; Matt. 24:11–13, 24; Rev. 19:20.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       These people are deceived by false miracles “because they did not
     receive the love of the truth.” When the desire for the spectacular is
     far more important than the desire for a new life in Christ, the mind is
     open to deception. The parable of the rich man and Lazarus concludes
     with Jesus’ insightful words, “ ‘But he said to him, “If they do not
     hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though
     one rise from the dead” ’ ” (Luke 16:31, NKJV). In other words,
     spectacular signs and marvelous wonders can never take the place of
     understanding and then following God’s Word. Obedience to God is
     primary; signs and wonders, if and when they come, are always only
     secondary.

      What kind of miracles have you experienced in your own life,
      in your own walk with the Lord? What have you learned from
      them? How important are they to your faith?

      Fruits and Gifts
What are some of the prime reasons that God gives the gifts of the Holy
      Spirit to His church? 1 Cor. 12:4–7, Rom. 12:4–8, Eph. 4:11–16.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         The gifts of the Holy Spirit may be divided into two large catego-
      ries: some gifts are qualities, other gifts are callings. For example,
      the gifts of helps, hospitality, exhortation, and teaching are qualities
      that God imparts to individual believers (Rom. 12:6–8). The gifts of
      apostles, prophets, evangelists, and pastor/teachers are callings given
      to individual believers (Eph. 4:11, 12). Both categories serve a similar
      purpose. They have been imparted by the Holy Spirit to strengthen
      the spiritual life of the church and equip it for mission. Spiritual gifts
      are not an end in themselves. They have been given by God for the
      benefit of His church.

What does the apostle Paul mean when he uses the expression “Walk in
      the Spirit” in Galatians 5:16? Read Galatians 5:22–25, and list each
      fruit that comes from walking in the Spirit. See also John 15:1–7.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         Any so-called revival that has little interest in the fruit of the Spirit
      but is obsessed with possessing the gifts of the Spirit is dangerous. If
      God gave the gifts of the Spirit in abundance to believers who were
      not manifesting the fruit of the Spirit, the church would become the
      center of selfish exhibitionism. For God to turn on Heaven’s power
      when the spiritual power lines are frayed would produce only disas-
      trous results. Beware of movements that concentrate on the gifts and
      power of the Holy Spirit rather than on obedience to God’s will and a
      transformed character that reveals the fruit of the Spirit.
        What do you say to someone who has experienced what he or
        she judges to be a supernatural manifestation from God? How
        can you help him or her to know if it truly were from God or
        from the other side? How does our understanding of the reality
        of the great controversy help us when we seek to understand
        who or what can be behind miracles?
                                                                              69

    Further Study: “The promise of the Spirit is not appreciated as it
         should be. Its fulfillment is not realized as it might be. It is the absence
         of the Spirit that makes the gospel ministry so powerless. Learning,
         talents, eloquence, every natural or acquired endowment, may be pos-
         sessed; but without the presence of the Spirit of God, no heart will be
         touched, no sinner be won to Christ. On the other hand, if they are
         connected with Christ, if the gifts of the Spirit are theirs, the poorest
         and most ignorant of His disciples will have a power that will tell
         upon hearts. God makes them the channel for the outworking of the
1
         highest influence in the universe.”—Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object
         Lessons, p. 328.

             “The apostle’s earnest words of entreaty were not fruitless. The
         Holy Spirit wrought with mighty power, and many whose feet had
         wandered into strange paths, returned to their former faith in the
2
         gospel. Henceforth they were steadfast in the liberty wherewith
         Christ had made them free. In their lives were revealed the fruits of
         the Spirit—‘love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness,
         faith, meekness, temperance.’ The name of God was glorified, and
         many were added to the number of believers throughout that region.”
         —Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 388.

    Discussion Questions:
3         l1 Dwell more on the contrast between cold formalism and
          unbridled fanaticism. Or, are they always in contrast? That is,
          could a church be fanatical and coldly formal at the same time?
          If so, how might that be made manifest? Why would either
          extreme, or both, be detrimental to revival and reformation?
          What about your own local church? Where does it stand in this
          area? How could you help it to find the right balance?

          l2 What evidence, if any, can we see of false revivals going on in
          the world? How can we know that they are false? On the other
          hand, would it be wrong to believe that God is working a revival
          among those who, though loving the Lord, don’t know the things
          that we do?

Mila’s Prayers
   Mila [MEE-lah] is six years old, but already she’s a prayer warrior. She
prays for people until God answers.
   One day at school Mila saw her teachers outside during their break
smoking cigarettes. Mila knows that smoking is dangerous, so right there
she prayed for them. “Dear Jesus,” she said, “please help my teachers
know that smoking is bad for them. Help them to stop smoking before it
makes them sick. Amen.”
   That evening when Father arrived home, he saw Mila sitting on the couch
with her head bowed. He wondered if something was wrong. He touched
her and asked if she was OK. Mila looked up and said, “I’m fine. I’m just
praying for my teachers. They smoke, and I don’t want them to get sick.”
   Daddy knew about Mila’s prayer ministry. He sat down beside her and
asked, “Would you pray for a woman at work? She smokes too.” Mila
smiled and bowed her head. She prayed for Daddy’s friend at work and
for her teachers. Mila kept praying for her teachers and her father’s friend
every day.
   Several weeks later, Daddy came home from work and told Mila that
his friend at work had stopped smoking. The woman told him that one
day she had suddenly lost her desire to smoke and hadn’t smoked again.
Daddy knew that the woman had tried to stop smoking many times before,
but she had failed.
   “What day did you stop smoking?” he asked. The woman thought for
a minute and then told him the date. “That was the day after my daugh-
ter started praying for you,” he said. Daddy told the woman that Mila
had been praying that she would stop smoking. She was surprised that a
child’s prayer could help her to stop smoking when nothing else could.
   “My teachers still smoke,” Mila said. “And I’m still praying for them.
Sometimes I tell them that smoking is bad for them and that I’m con-
cerned about them. I’ve told them that I’m praying for them. My teacher
says that she wants to stop smoking,” Mila added. “I’m sure God will
answer my prayers.”
   God answers our prayers, but He never forces someone to do something
against their wishes. When we pray for others, God works in their hearts
and in ours to answer those prayers. When we pray that people will meet
God and accept Jesus’ love, we must be willing to help make that happen
if God calls us.
   Our mission offerings help to provide tools to lead others to Christ, no
matter where they are. Thank you for giving so that others can meet God.

      Reformation: The
      Outgrowth of Revival




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: 2 Chron. 20:17–20; 1 Cor.
      6:19, 20; Rev. 2:1–6; Rom. 1:16, 17; Rev. 14:6, 7, 12.

Memory Text: “For both He who sanctifies and those who are
      being sanctified are all of one, for which reason He is not ashamed
      to call them brethren” (Hebrews 2:11, NKJV).



      R
              evival is an ongoing process. Daily our Lord invites us into the
              joy of His presence. Just as Israel was nourished by the manna
              that fell from heaven, Jesus spreads out a spiritual banquet for
      us every day. Daily our souls are nourished, our spirits refreshed, and
      our hearts revived as we kneel quietly before His throne, meditat-
      ing upon His Word. True spiritual renewal leads to a change in our
      thought patterns, habits, and lifestyle; it’s what we call a “reforma-
      tion.”
         “You therefore, beloved, since you know this beforehand, beware
      lest you also fall from your own steadfastness, being led away with
      the error of the wicked; but grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord
      and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory both now and forever.
      Amen” (2 Pet. 3:17, 18, NKJV). The term reformation simply refers
      to this “growing in grace”; it is allowing the Holy Spirit to align
      every aspect of our lives with God’s will. In those areas where we
      have drifted from obedience, revival reawakens our longings to please
      God. Reformation leads us to make the challenging choices to sur-
      render anything that stands between us and Him.

     The Prophet’s Appeal
     for Reformation
       God often sent His prophets to lead Israel into revival. Reformation
     regularly accompanied these times of revival. It is important to notice
     that even when God’s people drifted away from Him, they were still
     His chosen people. Again and again, He sent His messengers to guide
     them back. The examples of revival and reformation recorded in the
     Old Testament often have similar characteristics.
       Revival and reformation occurred in the Old Testament when there
     was a renewed heart commitment to obey God’s will. When Israel
     “turned to its own way” and “everyone did what was right in his own
     eyes” (Judg. 21:25), God withdrew His blessing, and the nation faced
     disaster and defeat.
       In one instance, when God’s people faced one of their great-
     est challenges—a battle with the Ammonites and Moabites—King
     Jehoshaphat showed remarkable spiritual leadership. Throughout the
     crisis, the king sought to keep the eyes of all Israel focused on the
     power of God (2 Chron. 20:12).
       The king recognized a critical point in sustaining all revival and ref-
     ormation. What earnest counsel did he give his people? What spiritual
     pattern do we discover here for revival and reformation?

Read 2 Chronicles 20:1–20 and summarize King Jehoshaphat’s instruc-
     tions to Judah.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       “God was the strength of Judah in this crisis, and He is the strength
     of His people today. We are not to trust in princes, or to set men in the
     place of God. We are to remember that human beings are fallible and
     erring, and that He who has all power is our strong tower of defense.
     In every emergency we are to feel that the battle is His. His resources
     are limitless, and apparent impossibilities will make the victory all the
     greater.”—Ellen G. White, Conflict and Courage, p. 217.
       Jehoshaphat’s experience illustrates the essence of revival and ref-
     ormation. He led Israel into a united time of fasting, praying, trusting,
     and obeying God.

      How can you learn, in your own times of stress and challenges,
      to apply the spiritual principles revealed here? What is the only
      way to truly exercise faith?

     Paul’s Appeal for Reformation in
     Corinth
       In his letter to the Corinthians, Paul expresses great concern regard-
     ing their spiritual condition. Many members had drifted from God’s
     ideal. The situation was serious, including sexual immorality that,
     Paul says, was not seen even among the pagans (1 Cor. 5:1). A whole
     host of problems arose that Paul had to address. In light of this back-
     ground, it is not difficult to understand why the Corinthian church
     needed revival and reformation.

What counsel did Paul give the Corinthians regarding their spiri-
     tual lives? What is the main idea in the following texts? 1 Cor. 6:
     19, 20; 9:24–27; 13:13; 15:1, 2, 27, 28.

       The apostle Paul urged them to steadfastly hold on to their faith and
     make God’s glory the primary goal of their lives. He reassured the
     Corinthians of his love and assured them that the power of God was
     greater than any temptation they faced (1 Cor. 10:13).

How did the Corinthian church respond to Paul’s counsel? 2 Cor.
     7:8–12.

        Paul was overjoyed with the Corinthians’ response. Although he
     still had concerns, he wrote, “I rejoice that I have confidence in you
     in everything” (2 Cor. 7:16, NKJV). What a change. In his first let-
     ter to the Corinthians, Paul chastised them as “carnal.” In his second
     letter he expressed complete confidence in their new experience
     with God. The Holy Spirit brought the Corinthians spiritual renewal.
     This revival brought a corresponding reformation. Reformation led
     to changed habits, changed lives, and changed relationships. The
     Corinthians still faced spiritual challenges. They had their share of
     trials, but they made significant advances in their Christian faith.
     Revival and reformation are not some panacea to solve all of our
     spiritual problems. They are part of an ongoing faith journey.

     Revelation’s Appeal for Reformation
     in Ephesus
        The seven churches described in Revelation 2 and 3 are repre-
     sentative of the Christian church throughout the centuries. This is a
     view that has been taken by Bible students throughout the centuries.
     Seventh-day Adventist expositors have historically taken this posi-
     tion, as well.
        The angel instructs John to “ ‘write the things which you have seen,
     and the things which are, and the things which will take place after
     this’ ” (Rev. 1:19, NKJV). The vision of the seven churches relates to
     the past, the present, and the future. It records the triumphs of God’s
     church, as well as its failures. It shares the church’s victories, as well
     as its defeats. Although the seven churches can represent a historical
     continuum of Christian faith down through the centuries, there are
     vital lessons in each one of these churches for God’s people today.
        Ephesus, for instance, provides a striking illustration of heaven’s
     appeal for revival and reformation.

Read Revelation 2:1–6. What are the good things about this church?
     But what are the problems, as well?

       Ephesus, here, is equated with the New Testament church from
     approximately a.d. 31 to a.d. 100. These early Christians were zealous
     for their faith. They labored unceasingly for the advancement of the
     gospel. The disciples diligently preserved the doctrinal purity of the
     church. They had no tolerance for heresy and were fierce defenders
     of truth.
       As time went on, however, the members began to lose their “first
     love.” They substituted duty for devotion. Doing Jesus’ work became
     more important than their relationship with Him. Gradually and
     almost imperceptibly, their experience with Jesus began slipping
     away. They were laboring hard to defend the faith, but something vital
     was missing in their own spiritual experience. Love for Jesus and for
     one another was desperately lacking.

      What was it like when you first came to know Jesus? How can
      you still maintain that “first love”? Why is it so important that
      you do so? What things threaten to turn you away from that
      love?
                                                                           75

     Luther’s Appeal for Reformation
       When we think of the word reformation, our minds are naturally
     drawn to the Protestant Reformation and Martin Luther. Until then,
     western Christianity was for the most part locked in tradition. The
     tenets of the church overshadowed the teachings of Jesus. Tradition
     became more quoted than Scripture. Multitudes were dominated by
     fear. They had little or no assurance of salvation. Confused and bewil-
     dered, they struggled to believe that God really longed to save them.
       It was at this crucial point of religious history that God raised up
     Martin Luther, among others, to lead His people into a thorough ref-
     ormation. Luther had struggled with the guilt of his own sins for years
     until the light of the gospel broke through.

Read the following passages from Romans. Why did they make
     such a powerful impact on Luther’s life? Why are they so vital in
     leading us to a revival of faith and reformation? Rom. 1:16, 17;
     3:21–25; 5:6–11; 8:1–4.

       “Sinners can be justified by God only when He pardons their sins,
     remits the punishment they deserve, and treats them as though they
     were really just and had not sinned, receiving them into divine favor
     and treating them as if they were righteous. They are justified alone
     through the imputed righteousness of Christ. The Father accepts
     the Son, and through the atoning sacrifice of His Son accepts the
     sinner.”—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 3, p. 194.
       Understanding grace is life transforming. It is the very essence of
     Christianity. God’s unmerited, undeserved grace is the cornerstone of
     our faith. Through the life, death, resurrection, and priestly ministry
     of Jesus, the gift of eternal life is ours. Receiving it by faith, we have
     the assurance of salvation.
       Revival has to do with appreciating the gift of grace every day.
     There is nothing more spiritually uplifting than the daily rejoicing in
     the goodness and grace of God. Reformation is simply living out this
     grace in all that we do.

      Dwell on the great hope that salvation is found in what Christ
      has done for you. Why must that truth be the foundation of any
      revival and reformation in your life?

     Heaven’s Appeal for an End-Time
     Reformation
        The Seventh-day Adventist Church is a reform movement. It was
     raised up by God to restore biblical truths lost sight of many centu-
     ries ago. Although the Holy Spirit worked powerfully through the
     Reformers, there were vital truths that they did not fully understand.
     God still had more truth to reveal to His people.
        God is not interested in our understanding truth merely in order to
     fill our minds with more religious knowledge. Biblical truths are win-
     dows into His very heart. They reveal something about His character.
     The more clearly that we understand the truths of His Word, the more
     completely we will understand the depth of His love. False doctrine
     distorts His character. Truth unmasks the devil’s lies and reveals
     who he really is (take, for instance, eternal torment in hell as a prime
     example of what lurks in Satan’s heart).
        From the inception of the great controversy in heaven, Satan has
     attempted to malign the character of God. He has lied about God’s
     intentions toward His creatures. But, in the life that He lived, in the
     truths that He taught, and in the death that He died, Jesus revealed
     what His heavenly Father was really like.

Read God’s end-time message of revival and reformation (Rev. 14:6,
     7, 12). Read carefully what is said there. What do these verses
     teach us about the character of God?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       God’s end-time message of the “everlasting gospel” includes a call
     to obedience to God’s will in the light of the judgment hour. The
     judgment reveals to the whole universe both the justice and mercy of
     God. In an age of evolution, Jesus’ message of reformation also calls
     His people back to worship the Creator on the true Bible Sabbath. The
     Sabbath is a stunning rebuke to the error of Darwinian evolution and
     to the harsh and violent depiction of God that it presents.

      What does it mean that the whole foundation of these mes-
      sages is the “everlasting gospel”? How can you daily have the
      assurance that this gospel message is for you, whatever your
      mistakes? Why is it so important that you daily claim the gospel
      message for yourself?

                                                                         77

    Further Study: “A revival and a reformation must take place under
         the ministration of the Holy Spirit. Revival and reformation are two
         different things. Revival signifies a renewal of spiritual life, a quick-
         ening of the powers of mind and heart, a resurrection from spiritual
         death. Reformation signifies a reorganization, a change in ideas and
         theories, habits and practices. Reformation will not bring forth the
         good fruit of righteousness unless it is connected with the revival of
         the Spirit. Revival and reformation are to do their appointed work, and
         in doing this work they must blend.”—Ellen G. White, The Advent
         Review and Sabbath Herald, Feb. 25, 1902.

            “Whatever may be their profession, it is only those who are world
         servers at heart that act from policy rather than principle in religious
         things. We should choose the right because it is right, and leave con-
         sequences with God. To men of principle, faith, and daring, the world
         is indebted for its great reforms. By such men the work of reform
2
         for this time must be carried forward.”—Ellen G. White, The Great
         Controversy, p. 460.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 In the call for revival and reformation, what must come first,
          revival or reformation, and why?

3         l2 Why are revival and reformation things of the heart more
          than anything else? Why must they start individually, with each
          of us making a conscious choice to renew our walk with the Lord,
          to draw closer to Him, and to seek more earnestly than ever to do
          His will? What is the danger of waiting for the person next to you
          in the pew to do this, or waiting for the pastor to initiate this?
          Why must you, yourself, now, make the choice to surrender even
          more fully to the Lord so that He will work in you?

          l
          3 Nothing could kill the call to revival and reformation more
          than a harsh and judgmental spirit toward those who don’t seem
          to live up to the standards that we think they should. How can we
          learn to avoid that dangerous pitfall while at the same time stand
          for the truths that have been entrusted to us?

Home at Last
   Sade Belo was born to Seventh-day Adventist parents in a village
in the Solomon Islands. He loved swimming and began competing
in swim meets in school. He qualified to travel to other islands of
the South Pacific to compete, but during this time he lost his way
spiritually.
   He completed high school and married a woman from a charis-
matic church. Sade attended church with her and was asked to be a
pastor. He enjoyed his church work, but often thought of the faith he
had left behind. The Sabbath still held a special place in his heart.
He was glad when his eldest son joined the Seventh-day Adventist
Church.
   When a Seventh-day Adventist pastor held some meetings in his
area, Sade attended. He listened to the messages on prophecy and
earth’s final days. Sade realized that even though he was a pastor, he
was a prodigal son. During one meeting he asked Jesus to take his
life completely and guide him back to the faith he had once known.
   He told his wife of his conviction to return to the Seventh-day
Adventist Church and invited her to study the Bible with him. He
explained to his congregation that he had been convicted that he
must follow the Bible and rejoin the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
He and his wife were baptized in 2008.
   Some members of the charismatic church asked to study the Bible
in order to learn what had impressed their former pastor to become a
Seventh-day Adventist. Sade focused on the beauty of God’s gift of
the Sabbath as he explained what had drawn him to the Seventh-day
Adventist faith. “The Sabbath isn’t so much about choosing to obey
God’s commandment to honor a particular day,” he says. “It’s more
about accepting a gift of fellowship with God.”
   Sade has a new mission now, to reach people who are just dis-
covering the beauty of the Sabbath and those who once knew it but
have fallen away. “I’m grateful that God was patient with me and
has led me back home to the [Seventh-day] Adventist faith. I thank
God for those in my family, including my older son, who prayed for
me for so many years. Your mission offerings help in many ways to
share God’s love with others. Many people in the Solomon Islands
don’t understand the faith I’ve learned to love. I want to share God’s
love and the beauty of His Sabbath with His children who live in the
heart of the Solomon Islands.”

        Lesson            10 *August 31–September 6
      Reformation: The Willingness
      to Grow and Change




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: 1 John 2:1–9, Phil. 2:12–14,
      Matt. 26:31–35, John 20:24–29, Luke 15:11–21, John 5:1–14.

Memory Text: “He gives more grace. Therefore He says: ‘God re-
      sists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.’ Therefore submit
      to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you” (James 4:6, 7,
      NKJV).



      B
              efore Pentecost, the disciples had significant spiritual needs.
              Their understanding of God’s plan was clouded. They failed to
              comprehend Jesus’ mission. After they were touched by divine
      grace, Christ’s love broke their hearts. They experienced revival and
      reformation.
        A revival is simply a reawakening of deeper spiritual longings. It is
      an intensifying of our spiritual desires as our hearts are drawn closer
      to God through the promptings of the Holy Spirit. Revival does not
      imply that we have had no previous experience with Jesus; rather, it
      calls us to an experience that is deeper and richer. Reformation calls
      us to grow and change. It appeals to us to move beyond the status quo,
      spiritually. It invites us to reexamine our lives in the light of bibli-
      cal values and to allow the Holy Spirit to empower us to make any
      changes necessary in order to live in obedience to God’s will.
        This week we will study the lives of New Testament believers who
      experienced growth and change in their own spiritual experience.

     The Grace to Grow
       The lives of the disciples showed constant spiritual growth as they
     walked with Jesus. When Christ first called His disciples, their attitudes
     and actions certainly did not reflect the loveliness of His character.

Read Luke 9:51–56 and Matthew 20:20–28. How do these passages
     reveal James’ and John’s thinking?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        James and John had some serious character flaws. They were not
     prepared to represent Christ’s love to the world. They were not quali-
     fied to proclaim a message of grace to others who had not changed
     their own lives.
        In spite of their serious defects of character, James and John longed
     to reveal Jesus’ character more fully. They longed for transformation
     and reformation in their own attitudes. Growth and change are part of
     our Christian experience.

Read 1 John 2:1–9. What do these verses reveal about the great
     changes that came over John during the years following Jesus’
     death? What do they teach us about what it means to be a fol-
     lower of Jesus?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

      It’s so easy to get discouraged over our own spiritual growth,
      especially as we truly want to have revival and reformation in
      our lives. When discouraged, when feeling as if you are a spiri-
      tual failure and that you are going to be lost, what promises can
      you claim that will show you why you must never give up, and
      why, despite your faults, you can have assurance of salvation?

     The Power to Choose
       Change comes at the point of choice. Reformation occurs as we
     choose to yield to the convicting power of the Holy Spirit and sur-
     render our wills to God’s will. God will never force or manipulate our
     wills. He respects our freedom. His Spirit impresses our minds, con-
     victs our hearts, and prompts us to do right, but the choice to respond
     to the Holy Spirit’s appeals is, always and only, our own.

Read Philippians 2:12–14. How does this passage show the necessity
     of cooperating with God in our growth in grace? What does Paul
     mean by “work out your own salvation”? What does he mean by
     “it is God who works in you”?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        It is not possible for us to work out what God has not already
     worked in. As He works in us through His supernatural power, we are
     able to make the choices to “work out” through our lives the grace and
     strength that He has worked into our lives.
        “As finite, sinful man works out his own salvation with fear and
     trembling, it is God who works in him, to will and to do of His own
     good pleasure. But God will not work without the co-operation of
     man. He must exercise his powers to the very utmost; he must place
     himself as an apt, willing student in the school of Christ; and as he
     accepts the grace that is freely offered to him, the presence of Christ
     in the thought and in the heart will give him decision of purpose to
     lay aside every weight of sin, that the heart may be filled with all the
     fullness of God, and of his love.”—Ellen G. White, Fundamentals of
     Christian Education, p. 134.
        Reformation occurs as we cooperate with God by choosing to sur-
     render to Him anything that the Holy Spirit points out as not being
     in harmony with His will. Unless we make those choices (sometimes
     very painful ones too), then positive, spiritual change will not occur.
        God will not rip some selfish thought out of our minds. He will not
     mysteriously snatch away unhealthful habits or secret indulgences. He
     convicts us of sin. He convinces us of right, but we must choose. Once
     we do, He empowers our choices, but it is we ourselves who have to
     daily, even moment by moment, make those choices.

      What does it mean to cooperate with God in the working out of
      our salvation? What doesn’t it mean? When was the last time
      that you felt deeply convicted over something and, through
      God’s grace, overcame, no matter how difficult the struggle?

     Confidence and Doubt
What was wrong with Peter’s attitude before the Cross? Matt.
     26:31–35.

     ________________________________________________________

       Peter was no match for the wiles of the evil one. He attempted
     to face Satan’s temptations in His own strength. Filled with a sense
     of self-inflated confidence, he had little idea of the crisis that was
     coming. Alone in Pilate’s courtyard and trembling at the sound of a
     servant girl’s questioning, Peter denied His Lord (Matt. 26:69–75).
     Jesus had warned Peter earlier, “ ‘Simon, Simon! Indeed, Satan has
     asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat. But I have prayed for
     you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to
     Me, strengthen your brethren’ ” (Luke 22:31, 32, NKJV). Jesus’ state-
     ment provides a fascinating analysis of Peter’s spiritual condition.
     Trusting in his own strength, Peter drifted from his Lord. This is why
     Jesus used the expression, “when you have returned to me.” Peter
     needed a spiritual awakening. He needed a change of attitude. He
     needed reformation.

Read John 20:24–29. What does this passage reveal about Thomas?
     What lessons can we take from this for ourselves?

     ________________________________________________________

        Both Peter and Thomas had one striking feature in common. They
     approached faith from a very human perspective. Peter placed con-
     fidence in what he could do; Thomas, in what he could see. They
     depended on their faulty human judgment. But Pentecost made a
     difference. A transformed Peter fearlessly preached, and three thou-
     sand were baptized on Pentecost (Acts 2:41). Peter realized that he
     certainly had no strength to heal a lame man, but Jesus had that power
     and a miracle took place (Acts 3:2–9). When the authorities attempted
     to silence his voice, Peter proclaimed, “ ‘For we cannot but speak the
     things which we have seen and heard’ ” (Acts 4:20, NKJV). Peter was
     a changed man. Thomas was changed also. It is believed that he sailed
     to India to preach the gospel. Though not much more is said about
     him, we can be sure that he had become a new man after Pentecost,
     as well.

      Who are you more like in temperament, Peter or Thomas?
      What can you learn from their experiences so that you don’t
      make similar mistakes?

     The Conviction to Return
Read Luke 15:11–21. What specific attitudes and actions led the
     prodigal to decide to return home? What principles of revival and
     reformation do we discover in this passage?

     ________________________________________________________

        Revival can be defined in different ways. However it may be
     defined, one factor ought not be missed: revival is coming home.
     It is a heart hunger to know the Father’s love in a deeper way.
     Reformation is the choice to respond to the Holy Spirit’s leading for
     change and growth. It is the choice to give up whatever stands in the
     way of this closer relationship with God. The prodigal could not have
     both the pigpen and the Father’s banquet table.
        Simply put, the young man missed home too much to remain where
     he was. There was an aching in his heart to return. It is this heartache
     for the presence of God that leads us to long for revival and reforma-
     tion. It is this heart cry for the warm embrace of the Father that moti-
     vates us to make necessary changes in our lives too.

As the young man prepared to return home, he planned his apology
     in advance. He must have rehearsed it again and again. Read his
     speech in Luke 15:18, 19 and his father’s interruption in verses
     20–24. What does this interruption reveal about the father’s atti-
     tude toward his son and God’s attitude toward us?

     ________________________________________________________

       Although his son was far from the father’s eyes, he was not far from
     his heart. The father’s eyes searched the horizon for his son each day.
     The greatest motivation to make changes in our lives is the desire to
     no longer break the heart of the One who loves us so much. When the
     boy was wallowing around in the mud with the pigs, the father suf-
     fered more than his son. Revival occurs when God’s love breaks our
     hearts. Reformation occurs when we choose to respond to a love that
     will not let us go. It takes place when we make the difficult choices
     to give up those attitudes, habits, thoughts, and feelings that separate
     us from Him.

      How is the statement “ ‘ “my son was dead and is alive
      again” ’ ” an insightful definition of true revival? What is it like
      to be dead and then alive again?

     The Faith to Act
         Jesus revealed the Father’s compassion and love through the mira-
     cles that He performed. He healed palsied bodies in order to reveal an
     even greater ability to heal palsied souls. He restored twisted arms and
     legs in order to demonstrate His greater desire to restore twisted hearts
     and minds. Jesus’ miracles teach us something about how to exercise
     faith. They teach us valuable lessons about growth and change.
       One of Jesus’ most powerful illustrations of the power of faith is
     found in the miracle of the sufferer at the pool of Bethesda. The poor
     man lay by the pool for thirty-eight years. He was hopeless. His life
     seemed doomed to wretchedness, poverty, and suffering until Jesus
     came.

Read John 5:1–14. Why do you think Jesus asked the man, “Do you
     want to be made well?” (John 5:6, NKJV). Isn’t it rather obvious that
     anyone suffering for so long would want to be healed? What was
     Jesus’ motive here? What was the man’s response? John 5:7.

        Jesus did not listen to the man’s excuse. He did not counter the
     excuse with an argument. He simply said, “ ‘Rise, take up your bed
     and walk’ ” (John 5:8, NKJV). The essential question was, Would this
     poor sick man believe the word of Christ and act upon it in spite of
     what he was experiencing? As soon as the man resolved to act upon
     the word of Christ, He was made whole. Jesus’ gift of healing was in
     His word. Christ’s word carried with it the power of the Holy Spirit
     to accomplish that which Christ declares.
        “If you believe the promise,—believe that you are forgiven and
     cleansed,—God supplies the fact; you are made whole, just as Christ
     gave the paralytic power to walk when the man believed that he was
     healed. It is so if you believe it.
        “Do not wait to feel that you are made whole, but say, ‘I believe it;
     it is so, not because I feel it, but because God has promised.’”—Ellen
     G. White, Steps to Christ, p. 51.

      Why is it so important to believe God’s promises for forgive-
      ness, especially when we feel so condemned and guilty for our
      sins? Why must forgiveness precede reformation in our lives?
      Why is it important to believe that we can overcome through
      Christ’s power in our lives, even now?
                                                                          85

    Further Study: “Let no man present the idea that man has little or
         nothing to do in the great work of overcoming; for God does noth-
         ing for man without his cooperation. Neither say that after you have
         done all you can on your part, Jesus will help you. Christ has said,
         ‘Without Me ye can do nothing’ (John 15:5). From first to last man
         is to be a laborer together with God. Unless the Holy Spirit works
         upon the human heart, at every step we shall stumble and fall. Man’s
1
         efforts alone are nothing but worthlessness; but cooperation with
         Christ means a victory. . . . Never leave the impression on the mind
         that there is little or nothing to do on the part of man; but rather teach
         man to cooperate with God, that he may be successful in overcom-
         ing.”—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 381.
2
           “All true obedience comes from the heart. It was heart work with
         Christ. And if we consent, He will so identify Himself with our
         thoughts and aims, so blend our hearts and minds into conformity
         to His will, that when obeying Him we shall be but carrying out our
         own impulses. The will, refined and sanctified, will find its highest
         delight in doing His service. When we know God as it is our privilege
         to know Him, our life will be a life of continual obedience. Through
         an appreciation of the character of Christ, through communion with
3
         God, sin will become hateful to us.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of
         Ages, p. 668.

    Discussion Questions:
          l1 Growth comes in the Christian life as we claim God’s prom-
          ises by faith, believing that He will do just what He says. What
          are the promises made to us here? 1 John 1:7–9, Phil. 4:13, James
          1:5–8, Rom. 8:31–39. How can you learn to believe them for
          yourself? More important, what choices can you make that will
          help these promises to become more real in your life?

          l
          2 Dwell more on this idea of working out your own salvation
          with “fear and trembling.” In class, talk about what that means,
          especially in terms of salvation by faith alone. What should we
          fear; what should cause us to tremble?

          l
          3 When was the last time, like Peter, that you made a promise
          to God that you, however sincere at the time you made it, utterly
          failed to follow through on it? What did you learn from that mis-
          take? What principles can we find in the Bible that will enable us
          to have the victories that we are promised?

Samba Jean’s Dilemma
   Samba Jean loved going into the forest near his mountain home in cen-
tral Madagascar to collect herbs for his magic. Although his family calls
themselves Christians, his father sees no problem mixing Christian beliefs
with witchcraft. He uses sticks and bones to determine who has cursed
someone, and he uses magic and traditional herbs to break curses, bring
good luck, and heal his clients.
   When Samba Jean was 14, a friend invited him to attend evangelistic
meetings. Samba Jean listened intently as the preacher read from God’s
Word. He heard things that were so different from what his father and his
priest had taught him. Who is right? he wondered. As he learned more, he
became convinced that the Seventh-day Adventist pastor who read from
the Bible was teaching the truth. He realized that his father’s powers were
from the devil.
   Samba Jean spent many restless nights trying to decide what he must do
with the new truths he was discovering. What will the devil do to me if I
refuse to help my father? he wondered.
   Samba Jean’s father tried to force the boy to take part in his witchcraft
ceremonies, but Samba Jean refused. The boy wanted to commit his life
completely to God in order to be free of the devil’s power. But his parents
insisted that he attend their church.
   Samba Jean asked the pastor to baptize him but allow him to continue
attending his parents’ church to keep the peace. But the pastor explained
that baptism means giving up all other religions and accepting only God’s
truth.
   As Samba Jean continued attending Bible studies, he realized that he
must leave his family’s faith and join the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
When he told his parents, his father refused to speak to him. Other family
members called him a traitor.
   Samba Jean took his stand for God and is trying to share his faith with
his family. But his father insists that his witchcraft has all the power he
needs. To keep the Sabbath holy, Samba Jean stays at the church all day
on Sabbath so he won’t be told to work. He tells those who visit his father
that he no longer believes in witchcraft, that God is more powerful than
his father’s witchcraft. Some of his father’s clients are studying the Bible
with him now.
   “I pray that soon my parents will give up their false beliefs and surren-
der to God,” Samba Jean says.
   Our mission offerings help us to reach people such as Samba Jean
around the world. Thank you for giving so that others can meet the Savior.
Samba Jean lives in the hills near Antananarivo, Madagascar.

      Reformation: Thinking New
      Thoughts


      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Col. 3:1, 2; 2 Cor. 3:17, 18;
      10:3–5; Rom. 12:2, 3; John 10:10; Matt. 5:13–15.

Memory Text: “If then you were raised with Christ, seek those
      things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand
      of God. Set your mind on things above, not on things on the
      earth” (Colossians 3:1, 2, NKJV).



      I
           saac Watts is credited with more than seven hundred fifty hymns,
           many of which are sung by thousands of Christians today. On one
           occasion, a parade was held in London in Watts’ honor. People
      thronged the streets to get a glimpse of this famous man. As his car-
      riage passed under a balcony filled with spectators, one lady was
      astonished that this short, elderly man now hunched over in old age
      had written such mighty hymns. She shrieked, “What, you are Isaac
      Watts?” Watts motioned for the carriage to stop. He stretched himself
      up to his full frame and exclaimed, “Madame, could I in fancy grasp
      the poles or hold creation in my span, I would still be measured by my
      mind, for the mind is the measure of a man.”
         Isaac Watts was right. The mind is the measure of a man, and refor-
      mation is about our minds. If we have a reformation in our thinking,
      we will have a reformation in our actions. Reformation occurs as the
      Holy Spirit brings our thoughts into harmony with Christ’s thoughts.
      When that happens, our actions will follow.

     The Mind Matters
       Our thoughts will ultimately dictate our behavior. The way that
     we think influences the way that we act. The converse is also true.
     Repeated actions influence our thoughts. The Christian is a “new
     creation.” Old thinking patterns have been replaced by new ones
     (2 Cor. 5:17).
       When a sailboat embarks on its seaward journey, the sails are set.
     The set sails give the boat its direction. Throughout the journey,
     the sails need to be reset in order to maintain the correct course. If
     the sails are neglected, the boat will veer off course very quickly.
     Like those sails, our thoughts give direction to our spiritual lives.
     When the apostle Paul admonishes Christians to “set your mind on
     things above” (Col. 3:2, NKJV), he is urging us to focus our thoughts
     heavenward. Our minds are shaped by what we put into them. Our
     thoughts are molded by what we spend our time dwelling upon.

What miracle of grace takes place in our own lives as we behold
     God’s glory in His Word? 2 Cor. 3:17, 18.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        As we behold Jesus in His Word, we are changed. New thoughts
     replace old ones. By beholding Him, we become more like Him.
     “It is a law both of the intellectual and the spiritual nature that by
     beholding we become changed. The mind gradually adapts itself to
     the subjects upon which it is allowed to dwell. It becomes assimilated
     to that which it is accustomed to love and reverence. Man will never
     rise higher than his standard of purity or goodness or truth. If self is
     his loftiest ideal, he will never attain to anything more exalted. Rather,
     he will constantly sink lower and lower. The grace of God alone has
     power to exalt man. Left to himself, his course must inevitably be
     downward.”—Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, p. 555.
        Reformation is all about looking to Jesus. It is about Jesus filling
     our minds. It is about Jesus shaping our thoughts. It is about Jesus
     guiding our actions. When we behold Jesus, He will lead us to higher
     standards than a mere rigidity to rules. We cannot really look to Jesus
     and remain the same. When we think His thoughts, we have only one
     desire, and that is to do His will.
      What counsel would you give to a person struggling to make Jesus
      a priority in his or her thinking process? What does the Bible
      mean when it talks about “beholding” or “looking to Jesus”?

      The Mind’s Filters
        There are some parents who are so concerned about their children’s
      Internet viewing habits that they have installed filters to block out
      certain sites. Others have done something similar with television. The
      purpose of these electronic filters is to let some things in while keep-
      ing others out. God has provided a “spiritual filter” for our minds. It
      has been carefully crafted to allow only those things into our minds
      that will build our spiritual experience with Jesus.

What practical instruction does Paul give to his fellow Christians as
      a filter designed to guard their minds from the intoxicating influ-
      ences of evil? How does this counsel apply today to our television,
      Internet, and movie-viewing habits? Phil. 4:7, 8; Rom. 12:2.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         Here is one simple reality. It is not possible to develop deeply
      spiritual thoughts if we feed our minds with violence, immoral-
      ity, greed, and materialism. Our senses are the gateway to our
      minds. If our minds are bombarded with the stimulating scenes of
      Hollywood’s entertainment, they will be molded by these sensual
      experiences rather than by the principles of God’s Word. Multiple
      millions of dollars are spent by media producers to manipulate our
      emotions, condition our thinking, and shape our values. We can be
      assured that the basic question that these entertainment gurus ask is
      not, “How can these productions prepare people for the soon return
      of Jesus?” The bottom line that motivates them the most is money.
      Seventh-day Adventist Christians preparing for the second coming
      of Christ should reflect carefully before sacrificing their souls on the
      altar of the world’s entertainment.

       There is a great cathedral with three large wooden entrance
       doors in Milan, Italy. Etched above the left-hand door are
       these words: “All that pleases is for a moment.” Over the
       right-hand door, these words stand out in bold relief: “All
       that troubles is but for a moment.” And emblazoned in bold
       letters over the center door is this poignant phrase: “That
       alone endures which is eternal.” Ask yourself: How often do
       you think about what’s eternal? How do your choices reflect
       those thoughts?

     The Mind’s Safeguard
        “And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will
     guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus” (Phil. 4:7, NIV).
     This is a wonderful promise but one that we have to actively seek in
     order to make it real in our lives.
        There are many ways in which we can let down our guard. We can
     let in the cesspool of this world’s entertainment. Our minds might
     be overcome by anger, bitterness, and resentment. They may be sub-
     merged in an ocean of intoxicating pleasure or addictive habits. The
     good news is that Jesus has promised to safeguard our minds—if we
     let Him.

Read 2 Corinthians 10:3–5. When Paul says that the “weapons of
     our warfare are not carnal” (NKJV) but spiritual, what does he
     mean? What are carnal weapons? What are spiritual weapons?
     The apostle also talks about “bringing every thought into captiv-
     ity to the obedience of Christ” (2 Cor. 10:5, NKJV). What does he
     mean, and how can it be accomplished?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Billy Graham is quoted as saying, “You cannot stop the birds from
     flying over your head, but you can stop them from nesting in your
     hair.” In other words, thoughts will rush into our minds. There are
     varying sights, sounds, and smells that stimulate certain thoughts.
     Different experiences evoke different emotions. We cannot always
     choose the thoughts that race through our minds. We can choose
     whether we will dwell upon them and allow them to dominate our
     thinking. To bring each thought into obedience to Christ is to surren-
     der our minds to Jesus. Carnal thoughts are not banished by merely
     wishing them away. They are driven out as the mind is filled with
     something else. The mind focused on the positive principles of God’s
     Word is the mind “safeguarded” and “kept” by God’s grace from the
     wiles of the evil one.

      When Paul says, “Let this mind be in you which was also in
      Christ Jesus” (Phil. 2:5, NKJV), what specifically does he mean?
      How is it possible for us to have the mind of Christ? Where
      does the word let, or allow, in the text place responsibility for
      change?

      Mind/Body Relationships
        The ancient Greeks taught a form of dualism; that is, they believed
      that there was a great distinction between our bodies and our souls.
      In contrast, Scripture teaches that human beings are an integrated unit
      of physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual dimensions. Whatever
      affects one part of the human frame affects all parts. The disciples
      taught that physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health were
      interconnected and could not be separated.

How is this idea reflected in 1 Thessalonians 5:23?
      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         For the New Testament believers, physical, mental, and emo-
      tional well-being are indissolubly linked to spiritual well-being. The
      apostle Paul appealed to believers to “glorify God in their bodies.”
      He believed that all humanity was bought with a price and we are not
      our own (1 Cor. 6:19, 20). Caring for our bodies by adopting a more
      healthful lifestyle does much more than add a few more years to our
      lives; done with the right motives, it can be an act of worship itself.

How do Romans 12:2, 3; John 10:10; and 1 Corinthians 10:31 show
      the intimate relationship between our physical and spiritual
      health?
      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         The Holy Spirit does not limit Himself to one aspect of our lives
      when He convicts us of our need for growth. Reformation is not one-
      dimensional. The Spirit longs to bring our lives into total conformity
      to the will of Christ in every area. If there are physical lifestyle prac-
      tices not in harmony with His will, God invites us to surrender them
      for His glory. Satan wants to control our minds through our bodies;
      Jesus longs to control our bodies through our minds. Our bodies are a
      temple, not a funhouse. By following heaven’s principles, we can live
      more joy-filled, productive, abundant, healthy lives.

       What are the personal experiences that have shown you just
       how inseparable the link is between our physical and spiritual
       natures? What choices can you make to help to bring them into
       more beneficial harmony?

     Images of Influence
       There are numerous images that Jesus uses to describe Himself and
     His church. One is “light.” He is “the light of the world” (John 8:12).
     He is also the “true Light which gives light to every man coming into
     the world” (John 1:9, NKJV). He encourages us to “walk while you
     have the light” and “believe in the light” (John 12:35, 36, NKJV).

Compare Matthew 5:13–15 with Philippians 2:14–16. What is our
     Lord’s goal for His people in this world? What does that mean in
     practical terms? How can we be what we are called to be?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        The goal of all revival and reformation is to allow the light of
     Christ’s love, grace, and truth to shine through our lives. Light
     shines in contrast to darkness. Jesus has called His people to live a
     lifestyle distinctly different from that which is lived in the world in
     order to demonstrate the superiority of His way of life. He calls us
     to be compassionate, caring, and concerned in a world of selfish-
     ness, greed, and egotism. He calls us to uphold high standards in
     entertainment in a society intoxicated with pleasure (Col. 3:1, 2).
     He calls us to healthful living at a time when millions are dying too
     young from self-inflicted degenerative diseases (John 10:10). In the
     midst of an immodest, sex-centered, jaded generation, Jesus calls us
     to something different. He calls us to modesty, propriety, and moral
     purity (1 Pet. 3:3, 4).
        The Old Testament prophet Isaiah gave a clarion call to Israel for
     reformation about seven hundred years before Christ. His words
     speak with relevance to a church waiting for the return of our Lord.
     “ ‘For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My
     ways,’ says the Lord. ‘For as the heavens are higher than the earth,
     so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your
     thoughts’ ” (Isa. 55:8, 9, NKJV). God’s ideal for His church and for
     us as individuals is higher than what we can imagine. All of heaven
     longs to reveal His character of love through His people.

      Look at the standards that mark your lifestyle. In what ways
      (if any) do they reveal that you are a follower of Jesus and that
      your life is set on something other than this fading world?

    Further Study: “Many profess to be on the Lord’s side, but they
         are not; the weight of all their actions is on Satan’s side. By what
         means shall we determine whose side we are on? Who has the heart?
         With whom are our thoughts? Upon whom do we love to converse?
         Who has our warmest affections and our best energies? If we are on
         the Lord’s side, our thoughts are with Him, and our sweetest thoughts
         are of Him. We have no friendship with the world; we have conse-
         crated all that we have and are to Him. We long to bear His image,
1
         breathe His spirit, do His will, and please Him in all things.”—Ellen
         G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2, p. 262.

            “It is the privilege of every soul to be a living channel through
         which God can communicate to the world the treasures of His grace,
         the unsearchable riches of Christ. There is nothing that Christ desires
2
         so much as agents who will represent to the world His Spirit and
         character. There is nothing that the world needs so much as the mani-
         festation through humanity of the Savior’s love. All heaven is waiting
         for channels through which can be poured the holy oil to be a joy and
         blessing to human hearts.”—Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object Lessons,
         p. 419.

3   Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 What terms does Paul use to describe the high calling of
          God’s people? 2 Cor. 5:18–20; 6:17, 18. What do these images
          mean in practical terms? How do our lives show that Paul is
          talking about us?

          l
          2 If we are honest, we can read and claim all the Bible promises
          we want, but unless we make a conscious choice at the moment of
          temptation to set our minds on the things that we should, we will
          succumb to temptation. What principles or practices have you
          found helpful in controlling your thoughts when tempted?

          these principles into our lives and into our outreach and wit-
          ness? What role should the health message have in revival and
          reformation?

Such a Little Thing
   Twelve-year-old Yvette walked along the dusty path, carefully balanc-
ing the plastic water jug on her head. She didn’t want to spill even a drop
of water. She passed children walking toward a nearby school. They were
dressed in dark skirts or trousers and white shirts. Yvette’s steps slowed
as she thought about the children learning to read and write and do math.
Sometimes she could hear them reciting their lessons aloud in the little
school. She sighed heavily and walked faster. Her mother was waiting
at home. There were meals to prepare, a garden to water, and clothes to
wash.
   Jean Claude walked along the narrow path gently prodding the family’s
cow with a large twig. He tapped her away from a neighbor’s property as
she searched for fresh grass to eat. His stick kept her safely away from the
nearby road where cars and trucks whizzed past.
   Jean Claude paused and looked up at the green patchwork gardens on
the hills that surrounded his home. The honk of a large truck stirred the
boy from his thoughts, and he hurried to catch up with the cow.
   The happy voices of children floated on the warm afternoon breeze.
Jean Claude used his branch to nudge the cow off the pathway so the
children could pass without getting dirty. He watched them pass and
wondered if he would ever go to school. His father explained that they
couldn’t afford to buy him a school uniform or school supplies. But in
his heart Jean Claude continued to hope that someday he could join the
children in the school.
   Schools in Rwanda no longer charge tuition, but many children, such as
Yvette and Jean Claude, still can’t study because they don’t have school
uniforms or supplies. Without an education, these children will continue
living in the cycle of poverty into which they were born.
   A school uniform is such a little thing. But it makes a big difference to a
child who can’t go to school without one. Recently Seventh-day Adventist
children around the world helped to provide school uniforms through the
Thirteenth Sabbath Offering. Because of their gifts, children such as Jean
Claude and Yvette can now attend a Seventh-day Adventist school.
   Our mission offerings and our Thirteenth Sabbath Offerings help to
make a world of difference to people we may never meet by providing
schools, clinics, evangelistic opportunities—and even school uniforms—
to reach them for Christ. Thank you for faithful support of mission
through your offerings.

      Reformation: Healing
      Broken Relationships




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: 2 Tim. 4:11, Philem. 1–25,
      2 Cor. 10:12–15, Rom. 5:8–11, Matt. 18:15–17.

Memory Text: “For if when we were enemies we were reconciled
      to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been
      reconciled, we shall be saved by His life” (Romans 5:10, NKJV).



      E
             ven after Pentecost, the relationship between believers was at
             times strained. The New Testament records repeated examples
             of the way that church leaders and individual members dealt
      with such challenges. These principles are extremely valuable for the
      church today. They reveal the positive results that can come when we
      use biblical principles to deal with conflicts.
        In this week’s lesson we will focus on restored relationships. Great
      spiritual revivals in the past fostered healed relationships. Movements
      of the Holy Spirit involve bringing people closer to God and to one
      another. They include breaking down the barriers in our relationship
      with God and breaking down barriers in our relationships with one
      another. In short, the greatest demonstration of the power of the gos-
      pel is not necessarily what the church says but how the church lives.
        “ ‘By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love
      for one another’ ” (John 13:35, NKJV). Without this love, all our talk
      about revival and reformation will come to naught.

     From Fracture to Friendship
        Paul and Barnabas worked together in witnessing for Jesus. But
     they had some strife between them (Acts 15:36–39). Paul could not
     trust one as fearful as John Mark. The potential dangers of preach-
     ing the gospel had caused John Mark at one point to desert Paul and
     Barnabas and return home.
        “This desertion caused Paul to judge Mark unfavorably, and even
     severely, for a time. Barnabas, on the other hand, was inclined to
     excuse him because of his inexperience. He felt anxious that Mark
     should not abandon the ministry, for he saw in him qualifications that
     would fit him to be a useful worker for Christ.”—Ellen G. White, The
     Acts of the Apostles, p. 170.
        Although God used all these men, the issues between them needed
     resolution. The apostle, who preached grace, needed to extend grace
     to a young preacher who had disappointed him. The apostle of for-
     giveness needed to forgive. John Mark grew in the affirming mentor-
     ship of Barnabas and, eventually, Paul’s heart was apparently touched
     by the changes.

How do Paul’s letters from prison to Timothy and the church at
     Colossae reveal his renewed relationship with John Mark and
     a new confidence in this young preacher? Col. 4:10, 11; 2 Tim.
     4:11.

     ________________________________________________________

        Although details of Paul’s reconciliation with John Mark may be
     sketchy, the biblical record is clear. John Mark became one of the
     apostle’s trusted companions. Paul highly recommended John Mark
     as a “fellow worker” to the church at Colossae. At the end of Paul’s
     life, he strongly encouraged Timothy to bring John Mark with him
     to Rome because he was “useful to me for ministry” (NKJV). Paul’s
     ministry was enriched by the young preacher, whom he had obviously
     forgiven. The barrier between them was broken, and they were able to
     work together in the cause of the gospel.

      How can we learn to forgive those who have hurt or disap-
      pointed us? At the same time, why does forgiveness not always
      include a complete restoration of a previous relationship? Why
      does it not always need to?

     From Slave to Son
        While he was imprisoned in Rome, Paul met a runaway slave
     named Onesimus who had fled from Colossae to Rome. Paul per-
     sonally knew Onesimus’ master. The Epistle of Philemon is Paul’s
     personal appeal to his friend regarding a restored relationship with
     the runaway slave.
        Relationships mattered to Paul. The apostle knew that fractured
     relationships are detrimental to spiritual growth. Philemon was a
     church leader in Colossae. If he harbored bitterness toward Onesimus,
     it would color his Christian witness.

Read Philemon 1–25. What important principles about restored
     relationships can we find here? Remember, the key word is prin-
     ciples.

     ________________________________________________________

        At first glance it is somewhat surprising that Paul did not speak
     more forcefully against the evils of slavery. But Paul’s strategy was
     far more effective. The gospel, ideally, breaks down all class distinc-
     tions (Gal. 3:28). The apostle sent Onesimus back to Philemon, not
     as a slave but as his son in Jesus and Philemon’s “beloved brother” in
     the Lord (Philem. 16).
        Paul knew that runaway slaves had little future. They could be
     apprehended at anytime. They were doomed to a life of destitution
     and poverty. But now, as Philemon’s brother in Christ and willing
     worker, Onesimus could have a wonderful future. His food, lodging,
     and job could be made secure under Philemon. The restoration of a
     broken relationship could make a dramatic difference in his life. He
     became a “faithful and beloved brother” and colaborer in the gospel
     with Paul (Col. 4:9).

      Drawing from the principles of the gospel as seen here, what
      can you take away that can help you to deal with whatever
      stresses and strains, even fractures, you have in relationships
      with others?

      From Comparison to Complement
As we saw in an earlier lesson, the church at Corinth had deep prob-
      lems. What principles does Paul outline in 1 Corinthians 3:5–11,
      12:1–11, and 2 Corinthians 10:12–15 for healing and restoration,
      all of which are so vital to revival and reformation?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         In these passages, the apostle outlines critical principles of
      church unity. He points out that Jesus uses different workers to
      accomplish different ministries in His church, even though each
      one is laboring together for the building up of God’s kingdom
      (1 Cor. 3:9).
         God calls us to cooperation, not competition. Each believer is
      gifted by God to cooperate in ministering to the body of Christ
      and serving the community (1 Cor. 12:11). There are no greater
      or lesser gifts. All are necessary in Christ’s church (1 Cor. 12:18–
      23). Our God-given gifts are not for selfish display. They are given
      by the Holy Spirit for service.
         All comparisons with others are unwise, because they will make
      us feel either discouraged or arrogant. If we think that others are
      far “superior” to us, we will feel despondent when we compare
      ourselves to them. If we think our labors for Christ are more effec-
      tive than the work of others, we will feel proud. Both of these atti-
      tudes cripple our effectiveness for Christ. As we labor within the
      sphere of influence that Christ has given us, we will find joy and
      contentment in our witness for Christ. Our labors will complement
      the efforts of other members, and the church of Christ will make
      giant strides for the kingdom.

       Can you think of someone whose gifts in ministry have made
       you jealous? (Not too hard, is it?) At the same time, how
       often have you felt proud of your gifts in contrast to those
       of others? The point is, Paul’s concerns are an ever-present
       reality in fallen beings. Regardless of the side on which we
       fall, how can we learn the unselfish attitudes that are neces-
       sary in order to avoid the pitfalls here?

      From Friction to Forgiveness
        What is forgiveness? Does forgiveness justify the behavior of
      someone who has horribly wronged us? Is my forgiveness dependent
      on the offender’s repentance? What if the one with whom I am upset
      does not deserve my forgiveness?

How do the following passages help us to understand the biblical
      nature of forgiveness? Rom. 5:8–11; Luke 23:31–34; 2 Cor. 5:
      20, 21; Eph. 4:26–30.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         Christ took the initiative in reconciling us to Himself. It is the
      “goodness of God [that] leads you to repentance” (Rom. 2:4, NKJV).
      In Christ, we were reconciled to God while we were yet sinners. Our
      repentance and confession do not create reconciliation. Christ’s death
      on the cross did; our part is to accept what was done for us.
         It is true that we cannot receive the blessings of forgiveness until
      we confess our sins. This does not mean that our confession creates
      forgiveness in God’s heart. Forgiveness was in His heart all the time.
      Confession, instead, enables us to receive it (1 John 1:9). Confession
      is vitally important, not because it changes God’s attitude toward us
      but because it changes our attitude toward Him. When we yield to the
      Holy Spirit’s convicting power to repent and confess our sin, we are
      changed.
         Forgiveness is also so crucial for our own spiritual well-being. A
      failure to forgive someone who has wronged us, even if he or she does
      not deserve forgiveness, can hurt us more than it hurts him or her. If
      an individual has wronged you and the pain festers inside because you
      fail to forgive, you are allowing that person to hurt you even more.
         Forgiveness is releasing another from our condemnation because
      Christ has released us from His condemnation. It does not justify
      another’s behavior toward us. We can be reconciled to someone
      who has wronged us because Christ reconciled us to Himself when
      we wronged Him. We can forgive because we are forgiven. We can
      love because we are loved. Forgiveness is a choice. We can choose to
      forgive in spite of the other person’s actions or attitudes. This is the
      true spirit of Jesus.

       How can focusing on the forgiveness we have in Christ help us
       to learn to forgive others?

     From Rancor to Restoration
Read Matthew 18:15–17. What three steps does Jesus give us to help
     us to resolve conflicts when we are wronged by another church
     member? How are we to apply these words in our contemporary
     situations?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Jesus’ desire in giving the counsel of Matthew 18 is to keep con-
     flict in as small a group as possible. His intent is that the two people
     involved solve the problem themselves. This is why Jesus declares,
     “ ‘If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault between
     you and him alone’ ” (Matt. 18:15, NKJV). As the number of people
     involved in a conflict between two individuals increases, the more
     contention is created. People take sides, and the battle lines are drawn.
     But when Christians attempt to settle their differences privately, and
     in the spirit of Christian love and mutual understanding, a climate of
     reconciliation is created. The atmosphere is right for the Holy Spirit to
     work with them as they strive to resolve their differences.
        There are times when personal appeals for conflict resolution are
     ineffective. In these instances, Jesus invites us to take one or two
     others with us. This second step in the reconciliation process must
     always follow the first step. The purpose is to bring people together,
     not drive them farther apart. The one or two who join the offended
     party are not coming to prove his or her point or to join in blaming
     the other individual. They come in Christian love and compassion as
     counselors and prayer partners in order to participate in the process of
     bringing two estranged people together.
        There are occasions when all attempts to solve the problem do not
     work. In this case, Jesus instructs us to bring the issue before the
     church. He is certainly not talking about interrupting the Sabbath
     morning worship service with an issue of personal conflict. The appro-
     priate place to bring the issue, if the first two steps have not helped to
     reconcile the two parties, is the church board. Again, Christ’s purpose
     is reconciliation. It is not to blame one party and exonerate the other.
         “Do not suffer resentment to ripen into malice. Do not allow the
     wound to fester and break out in poisoned words, which taint the
     minds of those who hear. Do not allow bitter thoughts to continue
     to fill your mind and his. Go to your brother, and in humility and
     sincerity talk with him about the matter.”—Ellen G. White, Gospel
     Workers, p. 499.
                                                                          101

    Further Study: “When the laborers have an abiding Christ in their
          own souls, when all selfishness is dead, when there is no rivalry, no
          strife for the supremacy, when oneness exists, when they sanctify
          themselves, so that love for one another is seen and felt, then the
          showers of the grace of the Holy Spirit will just as surely come upon
          them as that God’s promise will never fail in one jot or tittle.”—Ellen
          G. White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 175.

             “If we stand in the great day of the Lord with Christ as our ref-
          uge, our high tower, we must put away all envy, all strife for the
1         supremacy. We must utterly destroy the roots of these unholy things,
          that they may not again spring up into life. We must place ourselves
          wholly on the side of the Lord.”—Ellen G. White, Last Day Events,
          p. 190.

    Discussion Questions:
2
           l1 Read Colossians 3:12–17 in class. Discuss the Christian quali-
           ties that the apostle Paul encourages the church at Colossae to
           seek. Why are these qualities the basis for all conflict resolution?
           How do they guide us in carrying out the principles that Jesus
           gives us in Matthew 18:15–18?

           l2 Look again at Colossians 3:12–17 and the teachings found
           in these verses. Why are these things so utterly essential for
3
           the revival and reformation that we so desperately need in the
           church?

           l
           3 If we look at our church, that is, the Seventh-day Adventist
           Church, as a whole, what is the greatest thing holding us back
           from the kind of revival and reformation that will be needed in
           order to reach the world? Is it our teachings and doctrines? Of
           course not. These are the very things that God has given us to
           proclaim to the world. The problem lies solely in us, in our inter-
           personal relationships, our petty jealousies, our bickering, our
           selfishness, our desire for supremacy, and a whole host of other
           things. Why must you, yes, you, not the person next to you in the
           pew, not the pastor—but you, yourself—plead for the power of
           the Holy Spirit to bring the changes that have to occur in you
           before we will see revival and reformation in the whole church?

The Power of Faith
   I come from an influential family in central India and grew up worship-
ing stone gods. My parents wanted the best education for me, so they
enrolled me in a Seventh-day Adventist secondary school. We didn’t
know what “Adventist” meant then.
   I liked the school and made friends quickly. One friend, Amith, invited
me to his home on Saturday. I was surprised that he and his family weren’t
watching television but instead were talking about something called the
“Sabbath.” When I asked Amith what the Sabbath was, he invited me to
church the next Saturday. I was curious, so I went.
   Inside the church I recognized some people I knew from school. To my
surprise, the sermon was on the Sabbath. The pastor read Bible texts and
explained why the Sabbath was so special. I didn’t know Christ, but by
the time we left church I understood the Sabbath.
   I attended church with Amith every week. I loved the worship service,
and the hymns brought me peace. The Bible lessons were simple but pro-
found. Christianity was so different from my family’s religion.
   I often joined a classmate for her family’s worship. They explained dif-
ficult Bible texts, and I began reading the Bible for myself. The Creation
story was so different from what I had been taught. I knew I had to follow
God, not my family’s gods.
   I told my parents that I had decided to follow Jesus and would no longer
worship the gods I had once worshiped. But they didn’t give up. One day
they asked me to go with them on a religious pilgrimage—to carry their
luggage, they said. But when I realized that they wanted me to take part
in the temple rituals, I knew I couldn’t do it. I didn’t want to argue with
them, so I left the train at the next station and returned home.
   When my parents returned, they asked me why I had left them. I
explained that God forbids worship of other gods. We sat for five hours
as I explained what I could about God, Creation, Jesus’ life and death, and
His second coming. Finally my parents nodded. They didn’t understand
my new faith, but they let me follow my convictions.
   I thank God for leading me to the Seventh-day Adventist high school. It
changed my life. I now teach young people, knowing that they can share
their faith with their families. It’s my way of giving back.
   Our mission offerings help to build strong Seventh-day Adventist
schools around the world where thousands of young people find Christ
every year. Thank you for supporting missions.

              he challenge of preaching the gospel in the context of the three
              angels’ messages to the entire world may seem impossible.
              Although the Seventh-day Adventist Church is growing rap-
      idly, it is not keeping up with the population. There are multiple areas
      of the world where the name “Seventh-day Adventist” (much less our
      message) is not known.
         The reality of this harsh fact leads to serious questions. Is it possible
      for the gospel to be preached to the entire world in this generation?
      Will there be some unusual breakthrough that will dramatically speed
      up the proclamation of the three angels’ messages? There is always
      one thing to keep in mind when we discuss this topic: the mission
      is God’s, and He will accomplish it. At the same time, however, we

     The Promised Power
Christ’s Great Commission in Matthew 28:18–20 is accompanied
     by His great promise. What is that promise, what does it mean in
     a practical sense, and how can we draw comfort from it? Why is
     that promise so important to us?

        The disciples preached not in their strength but in Christ’s.
     According to Paul, in fact, the gospel was preached to every creature
     under heaven in just a few short years (Col. 1:23). Although some
     might question the precise meaning of Paul’s words, it is undeni-
     able that the gospel made a powerful impact on first-century society.
     It changed the world. Christ promised His disciples that He would
     “ ‘send the Promise of My Father’ ” and they would receive “ ‘power
     from on high’ ” (Luke 24:49, NKJV). The Savior added, “ ‘You shall
     receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you shall
     be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to
     the end of the earth’ ” (Acts 1:8, NKJV).
        No matter how challenging the task, the promises of God are sure.
     Jesus’ statement that “ ‘this gospel of the kingdom will be preached
     in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will
     come’ ” (Matt. 24:14, NKJV) is a promise. The proclamation of the
     gospel to the entire world may seem impossible, but God’s power will
     overcome every obstacle. Every person on planet Earth will have a
     reasonable opportunity to hear and understand God’s message of love
     and truth before the return of our Lord (see Rev. 18:1).
        “I saw angels hurrying to and fro in heaven, descending to the earth,
     and again ascending to heaven, preparing for the fulfillment of some
     important event. Then I saw another mighty angel commissioned to
     descend to the earth, to unite his voice with the third angel, and give
     power and force to his message. Great power and glory were imparted
     to the angel, and as he descended, the earth was lightened with his
     glory. The light which attended this angel penetrated everywhere.”
     —Ellen G. White, Early Writings, p. 277.
        God will finish His work. He will pour out His Spirit in mighty
     power and accomplish what seems impossible according to all human
     planning.

      What are ways that you can, in your immediate sphere, be a
      more effective witness for the Lord? That is, what can you do
      to help to see the fulfillment of Matthew 24:14?

      The Early and Latter Rain
        Both the Old and New Testaments use the symbolism of water to
      represent the Holy Spirit. The prophet Isaiah quotes the words of our
      Lord, “ ‘ “I will pour water on him who is thirsty. . . . I will pour My
      Spirit on your descendants” ’ ” (Isa. 44:3, NKJV). Isaiah uses a com-
      mon Hebrew literary device called parallelism. The second phrase
      in the passage explains the first. The prophet Joel also discusses
      the symbolism of water. God promises to water Israel’s fields, then
      declares, “ ‘And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out
      My Spirit on all flesh’ ” (Joel 2:28, NKJV). Jesus uses the symbolism
      of water to represent the Holy Spirit (John 7:37–39).

What are the two symbols that each of the following texts use regard-
      ing the outpouring of the Holy Spirit? Joel 2:21–24; 28–32; James
      5:7, 8. How are we to understand what they mean?
      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         In Bible times, sowing and plowing took place from the middle of
      October, shortly after the falling of the early rains. These early rains
      brought the seed to germination and nurtured its early growth. The
      latter rain came in the late spring to bring the ripening fruit to harvest.
      The barley harvest and other grain harvests were spring events, fol-
      lowed by the fruit harvest in the summer and fall.
         God uses the symbolism of the early and latter rain in two ways.
      The early rain of the Spirit fell upon the disciples at Pentecost in order
      to launch the Christian mission. The latter rain will be poured out on
      God’s church at the end of time in order to complete His mission on
      earth. The term early rain also refers to the daily work of God’s Spirit
      convicting, instructing, guiding, and empowering each believer. The
      latter rain is a term used to describe a special endowment of God’s
      Holy Spirit on Christ’s church just before the coming of Jesus.
         “Under the figure of the early and the latter rain, that falls in
      Eastern lands at seedtime and harvest, the Hebrew prophets foretold
      the bestowal of spiritual grace in extraordinary measure upon God’s
      church. The outpouring of the Spirit in the days of the apostles was the
      beginning of the early, or former, rain, and glorious was the result. . . .
         “But near the close of earth’s harvest, a special bestowal of spiritual
      grace is promised to prepare the church for the coming of the Son of
      man. This outpouring of the Spirit is likened to the falling of the latter
      rain; and it is for this added power that Christians are to send their
      petitions to the Lord of the harvest ‘in the time of the latter rain.’ ”
      —Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 54, 55.

     Prerequisites for the Latter Rain
What do the following texts tell us about the preparation needed in
     order to receive the Holy Spirit’s power in its fullness? Acts 1:14,
     Zech. 10:1, Acts 3:18–20, 4:31, Ps. 119:25, John 6:63.
     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       The Scriptures invite us to ask God for the Holy Spirit (Luke
     11:13). The disciples believed Christ’s promise, waited in unity, and
     prayed for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:8, 14). The reason
     that God asks us to pray for the Holy Spirit is not that He is unwilling
     to give us the Spirit but that we are not prepared to receive it. As we
     pray for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, God works on our hearts
     to lead us to deeper repentance. Praying in small groups with other
     church members draws us into a closer bond of unity and fellowship.
     Both prayer and Bible study prepare our minds to be sensitive to the
     ministry of the Holy Spirit in our lives.

What is the natural result of spiritual renewal in our lives? Where
     does all spiritual revival and reformation lead? Ps. 51:10–13; Acts
     4:13, 20; 5:33; 8:4.
     ________________________________________________________

       All spiritual revival and genuine reformation lead to a passionate
     desire to witness. When our hearts are filled with a deep appreciation
     for everything that Jesus has done for us, then, like Peter and John,
     “ ‘we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard’ ”
     (Acts 4:20, NKJV). The outpouring of the Holy Spirit in the early
     rain on the day of Pentecost empowered the disciples to effectively
     witness. Their witness was so powerful that a rebellious mob in
     Thessalonica screamed in fear that “ ‘these who have turned the world
     upside down have come here too’ ” (Acts 17:6, NKJV).
       Just as the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost
     enabled the disciples to be a formidable witness to their generation,
     the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in latter-rain power will empower
     God’s church to reach the world in the final generation. It will take
     nothing less than latter-rain power to complete God’s mission on
     earth, and God offers nothing less. Heaven’s most precious gift is
     offered in infinite supply in order to accomplish the most urgent and
     important task ever entrusted to His church.

      The early disciples turned the world “upside down” with their
      preaching and witness. Why isn’t that said of us?
                                                                        107

      The Baptism of Fire
        Both the Old and New Testaments use a variety of symbols, such
      as water, wind, and oil, to describe the work of the Holy Spirit. John
      the Baptist links another image, that of fire, to the work of the Holy
      Spirit (Matt. 3:11, Luke 3:16).
        There are many who have misunderstood John’s statement. The
      passage does not say, “ ‘He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit or
      with fire’ ” (NKJV). It says, “He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit
      and with fire.” The second expression, “ ‘and with fire,’ ” explains
      the first expression, “the baptism of the Holy Spirit.” The baptism of
      the Holy Spirit is the baptism of fire. The word baptism in the New
      Testament is used 80 times and refers to total immersion.

Read the following passages and describe what the symbolism of fire
      represents in the Bible. Exod. 3:2–4; 24:17; 1 Kings 18:24; Mal.
      3:2, 3; Acts 2:1–4; Heb. 12:29.
      ________________________________________________________

         The symbolism of fire is a symbol of the glory, presence, and power
      of God manifest in the ministry of the Holy Spirit. To be baptized with
      fire is to be immersed in the glory of God’s presence through the Holy
      Spirit in order to witness in His power. Moses met God at the burn-
      ing bush and then left the glory of His presence in order to witness to
      Pharaoh. Elijah witnessed to Israel in the glory of God’s fiery pres-
      ence on Mount Carmel. When tongues of fire fell on Pentecost, the
      disciples witnessed in languages that they had never before known.
      The baptism of the Holy Spirit is immersion in the presence and
      power of God in order that we can effectively witness of His glory.
      Once again, in the last days of earth’s history, God’s people will be
      immersed in His presence, filled with His power, and sent out to wit-
      ness of His glory to the world.
         The earth will be filled with the glory of God. “The earth will be
      filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover
      the sea” (Hab. 2:14, NKJV). In prophetic vision, John saw an angel
      messenger descend from heaven and “the earth was illuminated with
      his glory” (Rev. 18:1, NKJV).
         God’s glory, His loving character, will be revealed through the
      power of the Holy Spirit to a waiting world and a watching universe.
      Every person on planet Earth will have the opportunity to both hear
      and understand God’s last-day message.

       God’s glory, His loving character, will be revealed to the world.
       How can you, right now, in your own sphere, reveal that glory
       in your life? What will that require on your part?

      The Great Controversy Ended
       The entire book of Revelation can be summarized in just a few
      words: Jesus wins, Satan loses.

Read Revelation 12:17; 17:13, 14; 19:11–16. What is the central mes-
      sage of these passages?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Here is good news: the same Jesus who defeated Satan on the cross
      will come again and triumph over the powers of hell and put a full end
      to evil (Rev. 19:19–21; Ezek. 28:18, 19). Evil will not have the last
      word. Poverty and pestilence will not have the last word. Sickness and
      suffering will not have the last word. Chaos and crime will not have
      the last word. Disease and death will not have the last word.
        Instead, God will.
        Until then, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are doing everything
      possible to reach every person. God’s heart aches over a lost world.
      Soon His people will reveal to the world, in both the witness of their
      words and their works, Jesus’ amazing grace and truth.
        Of course, Satan will do everything in His power to oppose this
      witness. The final crisis will break upon this world. Jesus will pour
      out His Spirit in latter-rain power, and the work of God on earth will
      be finished.
        “Servants of God, with their faces lighted up and shining with holy
      consecration, will hasten from place to place to proclaim the message
      from heaven. By thousands of voices, all over the earth, the warning
      will be given. Miracles will be wrought, the sick will be healed, and
      signs and wonders will follow the believers.”—Ellen G. White, The
      Great Controversy, p. 612.
        The work of God on earth will be finished. Jesus will come. All
      heaven and earth will rejoice. There is no more important priority
      in our lives than experiencing a revival of God’s grace in our hearts
      daily and inviting His Holy Spirit to make us into His image (1 John
      3:1–3).

       Our world is falling apart. Who can’t see that? Is there any-
       thing that matters more than opening our hearts to Jesus and
       pleading for the revival and reformation so needed, not just by
       each one of us individually but by our church as a whole? What
       would happen if our own hearts were totally surrendered to
       Him and we were completely devoted to spreading this message
       to the world?
                                                                       109

    Further Study: “The message will be carried not so much by argu-
          ment as by the deep conviction of the Spirit of God. The arguments
          have been presented. The seed has been sown, and now it will spring
          up and bear fruit. The publications distributed by missionary workers
          have exerted their influence, yet many whose minds were impressed
          have been prevented from fully comprehending the truth or from
          yielding obedience. Now the rays of light penetrate everywhere, the
          truth is seen in its clearness, and the honest children of God sever
1         the bands which have held them. Family connections, church rela-
          tions, are powerless to stay them now. Truth is more precious than all
          besides. Notwithstanding the agencies combined against the truth, a
          large number take their stand upon the Lord’s side.”—Ellen G. White,
          The Great Controversy, p. 612.

2   Discussion Questions:
           l
           1 In the statement above, Ellen G. White wrote: “The message
           will be carried not so much by argument as by the deep convic-
           tion of the Spirit of God.” In class, discuss what you think that
           means. What does it not mean? After all, our message is very
           logical, very reasonable, and it comes with some very powerful
           arguments in its favor. How are we to understand, then, what
           she is telling us?
3
           l
           2 What spiritual application do the promises God gave to His
           people in the Old Testament have for His church today? Deut.
           11:13–18, Hos. 6:1–3, 10:12.

           l
           3 Dr. Stephen Hawking, one of the world’s greatest scientists,
           called the concept of an afterlife a “fairy story for people afraid
           of the dark.” Why does a statement like that show just how cru-
           cial and hopeful our message is for a world that knows neither
           God nor His love?

           l4 Though we don’t know when Jesus is going to come back,
           we do know that we want Him to and that we want this sin-sick
           world to end and a new sinless world to begin. That’s why we
           believe revival and reformation are so crucial to us as a people,
           and it’s why our leaders are calling us to it. In the end, though, it
           will not come by anything other than the work of the Holy Spirit
           in our hearts, and that will not happen until we, as individuals,
           make a conscious choice to surrender ourselves with all our
           hearts and souls and minds to the Lord. How can we, without
           judging others, without making comparisons among ourselves,
           do our part to encourage one another to be prepared for the
           work of the Holy Spirit in our lives?

I Want to Serve!
   Marquan loves Jesus and wants everyone to know about Him. When he
was five, he wanted to learn to read so he could read the Bible for himself.
One day he asked his pastor for a job at church. The pastor invited him to
tell the children’s story. Marquan did a good job and was invited to speak
more often. Then one day the pastor asked him to preach.
   “Me? I’m only eight years old,” Marquan said, surprised.
   “It doesn’t matter how old you are.” The pastor smiled. “God can use
anyone who is willing.”
   I’m just a kid, Marquan thought. What would I preach about? Would
people even listen to a child? Marquan promised to pray about it.
   Marquan’s grandmother told him that the prophet Jeremiah had thought
he was too young to preach, too, but God had told him that he must share
the love of God with everyone God sent him 10. Marquan decided that
God was asking him to preach. His father helped him to write his first
sermon, and then Marquan memorized it.
   Marquan felt a little nervous on the day he was to preach. But he
remembered God’s words to the prophet Isaiah, “I have put my words in
your mouth” (Isaiah 51:16, NIV). Marquan knew that God was with him,
and his nervousness went away.
   People at other churches in his town heard about the boy’s sermon, and
they invited him to speak at their churches. Marquan accepted the invita-
tions, for he had promised God that he would do whatever God asked him
to do. He prayed that his sermons would be a blessing to everyone who
heard them.
   When Marquan was 12, his pastor offered him a new challenge. “The
church is planning a three-week Revelation Seminar, and we would like
you to lead it,” the pastor said. Preparing and preaching 21 sermons was a
huge commitment for a young boy. But Marquan prayed about it and felt
sure that God wanted him to do it.
   The church held the meetings in a rented hall. On opening night some
250 people came. Many returned each night to hear a young boy preach
God’s Word.
   “I’ve learned that if we’re willing, God can use anyone to tell others
about Jesus,” Marquan said. “It doesn’t matter how old you are; Jesus just
wants you to be willing to tell others about Him.”
   God has blessed us with truths that millions don’t know. It’s our duty to
share these truths. We can tell others, we can pray for them, and we can
give mission offerings so that those whom we may never meet will have
a chance to hear that Jesus loves us.
Marquan Buchanan shares his faith in his hometown in Arkansas, United States.

2013    Bible Study Guide for the Fourth Quarter
          Ellen G. White recommended focusing our highest attention on
       the sanctuary because “the sanctuary in heaven is the very center of
       Christ’s work in behalf of men.”—The Great Controversy, pp. 488,
       489.
          The sanctuary discloses the heart of God. The greatest revelation of
       the love and character of God was at the cross. To help us to under-
       stand better what this great sacrifice meant, God devised the earthly
       sanctuary, a pictorial representation of the plan of salvation. This
       earthly sanctuary, however, only modeled the heavenly one, which is
       the true center of God’s presence and of His activity in the universe.
       The sanctuary formed the template to help us to understand Jesus as
       our Sacrifice and High Priest.
          Our study of The Sanctuary, the fourth quarter 2013 guide by Martin
       Pröbstle, will explore God’s sanctuary, both His earthly model and the
       heavenly original, and bring us close to the presence of God.
