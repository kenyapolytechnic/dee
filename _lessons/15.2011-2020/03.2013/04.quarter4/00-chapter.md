The Picture of Salvation

U           nquestionably, the greatest revelation of the love and character of God
            was at the Cross, where the Lord offered Himself in the person of Jesus
            Christ as a sacrifice for the sins of a world that never had to sin to begin
with. To help us to understand better what this great sacrifice meant, God devised
the earthly sanctuary, a pictorial representation of the plan of salvation. This earthly
sanctuary, however, only modeled the heavenly one, which is the true center of
God’s presence and of His activity in the universe.
   When God established the sanctuary on earth, He used it as a teaching tool. The
Israelite sanctuary and its services displayed important truths about redemption,
about the character of God, and about the final disposition of sin.
   The sanctuary formed the template to help us understand Jesus as our Sacrifice
and High Priest. When John the Baptist told his disciples that Jesus was the “Lamb
of God who takes away the sin of the world” (John 1:29, 36, NKJV), they under-
stood what John meant because they understood something of the sanctuary. The
book of Hebrews presupposed a knowledge about the ancient Israelite priesthood so
that the original recipients of the letter could grasp what Jesus was doing for them
in heaven. Sanctuary terminology was also used to teach truths about Christian liv-
ing. In short, knowledge of the sanctuary system became a foundation for the new
message of salvation in Christ.
   However, throughout much of the Christian era, the sanctuary message was
largely forgotten. Not until the middle of the nineteenth century, when Seventh-day
Adventists began to appreciate God’s paradigm of salvation anew, including the mes-
sage of the pre-Advent judgment, was a fresh emphasis placed on the sanctuary.
   “The subject of the sanctuary was the key which unlocked the mystery of the dis-
appointment of 1844. It opened to view a complete system of truth, connected and
harmonious, showing that God’s hand had directed the great advent movement and
revealing present duty as it brought to light the position and work of His people.”
—Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, p. 423.
   As the key for a complete system of truth, the sanc-
tuary and Christ’s priestly ministry became the basis          The sanctuary
for the Seventh-day Adventist faith—and still remains
                                                               formed the tem-
so. In fact, the sanctuary message is the Adventists’
unique doctrine. At the same time, no other doctrine           plate to help us
of the Seventh-day Adventist Church (with the possible         understand Jesus
exception of the Sabbath) has faced so many challenges.        as our Sacrifice
Fortunately, throughout the years, these challenges have       and High Priest.
not only been withstood, but they have increased our
understanding of this crucial teaching and have made
us, as a people, stronger in our understanding of salvation.
   Ellen G. White recommended focusing our highest attention on the sanctuary
because “the sanctuary in heaven is the very center of Christ’s work in behalf of
men. It concerns every soul living upon the earth. It opens to view the plan of
redemption, bringing us down to the very close of time and revealing the trium-
phant issue of the contest between righteousness and sin. It is of the utmost impor-
tance that all should thoroughly investigate these subjects.”—The Great Controversy,
p. 488. Thus, we can “exercise the faith which is essential at this time” and “occupy
the position which God designs [us] to fill.”—The Great Controversy, p. 488.
   The sanctuary discloses the heart of God. Studying the sanctuary will bring us
close to the presence of the Supreme and to the personality of our Savior and draw
us into a deeper personal relationship with Him.
   Hence, our study for this quarter: God’s sanctuary, both His earthly model and
the heavenly original.

      The Heavenly
      Sanctuary


      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Jer. 23:23, 24; Ps. 89:14;
      Revelation 4, 5; Ps. 11:4–7; Deut. 25:1; Heb. 8:1, 2.

Memory Text: “ ‘[T]hen hear in heaven Your dwelling place their
      prayer and their supplication, and maintain their cause’ ” (1 Kings
      8:49, NKJV).



      W
                 here does God live?”
                 This innocent question of a six-year-old could be quite per-
                 plexing. It could easily lead to more difficult ones, such as,
      “If God lives in one place, how is it possible that He is everywhere?”
      Or, “Does God need a dwelling place?” Or, “If He doesn’t need one,
      why does He have one?” Or, “If He does need one, why does He
      need it?”
         These are good questions, and, given the little we know (and the lot
      we don’t), they are not so easy to answer.
         Nevertheless, we can answer with what we do know. As Seventh-
      day Adventists, we know from the Bible that God dwells in heaven,
      that He is actively working in our behalf “up there,” and that the
      center of His work is in the heavenly sanctuary.
         Scripture is clear: the heavenly sanctuary is a real place, and from
      it we can learn truths about the character and work of our God. Thus,
      the focus of this week’s lesson is the heavenly sanctuary and what
      God is doing there for us, because what He is doing in the sanctuary
      is, indeed, for us.

*Study this week’s lesson to prepare for Sabbath, October 5.

     God’s Residence
        We often say that “God is everywhere.” Or that He is “omnipres-
     ent,” which means that He is present throughout the universe. “ ‘Am
     I a God near at hand, . . . and not a God afar off? . . . Do I not fill
     heaven and earth?’ ” (Jer. 23:23, 24, NKJV). David understood, too,
     that nobody can flee from God (Psalm 139). Indeed, as Paul argues,
     God is close to everyone, at least in a spiritual sense (Acts 17:27, 28).
        Complementing God’s attribute of omnipresence is His eternal
     existence. God has neither beginning nor end (Ps. 90:2). He has
     always been and will always be (Jude 1:25).

Read 1 Kings 8:49 and Psalm 102:19. What do they teach us about
     the place where God dwells? How are we to understand what this
     means? Can we understand it?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

       The Scriptures are full of statements about God’s residence being
     in heaven (1 Kings 8:30, 43, 49). Does this mean that God is more
     present in heaven than He is anywhere else? God obviously dwells in
     heaven in a special way, in His glorious presence and pure holiness.
     The greatest manifestation of God’s presence exists in heaven.
       There is a difference, however, between God’s “general presence”
     and His “special presence.” God is generally present everywhere; yet,
     He chooses to reveal Himself in a special way in heaven and, as we
     will see, in the heavenly sanctuary.
       Of course, we have to admit that we are limited in our understand-
     ing of His physical nature. He is spirit (John 4:24) and, as such, can-
     not be contained in any structure or dimension (1 Kings 8:27). Even
     so, the Bible presents heaven (John 14:1–3) and the heavenly sanctu-
     ary as real places (Heb. 8:2) where God can be seen (Acts 7:55, 56;
     Rev. 4:2, 3). We have to believe that even heaven and the heavenly
     sanctuary are places where God condescends to meet His creation.

      There are many things that are difficult for us to imagine or
      understand, such as the dwelling place of God. Yet, the Bible
      says that this dwelling place is real. How can we learn to trust in
      all that the Bible teaches us, no matter how hard it is sometimes
      to understand? Why is it important for us to learn to trust even
      when we don’t understand?

                                                                            7

     Throne Room
Read Psalms 47:6–9; 93:1, 2; 103:19. What do these texts teach us
     about God and His throne?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Several visions of the heavenly throne occur in the Bible. Most
     depict a kind of heavenly assembly with God as King. Interestingly
     enough, most of them are concerned with human affairs—usually
     presenting God as acting for or speaking in behalf of the righteous.
        The Bible also reveals God as sovereign. For instance, the kingship
     of the Lord is a recurring theme in the Psalms. God is not only King
     of heaven but also “King of all the earth” (Ps. 47:7, NKJV), and not
     only in the future but already in the here and now (Ps. 93:2).
        That God’s throne is established in heaven has several ramifica-
     tions. One of them is that God is independent and superior to the rest
     of the universe.

Read Psalms 89:14, 97:2. What do these texts teach us about the
     character of God and how He rules?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        God’s rule encompasses righteousness and justice, as well as love
     and truthfulness. These moral qualities describe how He acts in the
     human world and underscore His position in the entire universe.
     These qualities, which compose His rule, are also the same as those
     that He wants His people to manifest in their lives (Mic. 6:8, compare
     with Isa. 59:14), and it is our sacred privilege to do so.
        “As in obedience to His natural laws the earth should produce its
     treasures, so in obedience to His moral law the hearts of the people
     were to reflect the attributes of His character.”—Ellen G. White, The
     Adventist Home, p. 144.

      How can we better manifest goodness, righteousness, and jus-
      tice in a world filled with evil, unrighteousness, and injustice?
      Why must we do these things?

     Worship in Heaven
Read Revelation 4 and 5. What do these two chapters teach us about
     the heavenly dwelling place of God? In what way is the plan of
     salvation revealed in these texts, as well?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        The vision of the heavenly throne room is a vision of the heavenly
     sanctuary. This is made evident from the language referring to the
     Hebrew religious system. For instance, the words for “door” and “trum-
     pet” in Revelation 4:1 appear often in the Septuagint (an ancient Greek
     translation of the Old Testament) in reference to the sanctuary. The
     three precious stones in Revelation 4:3 are part of the High Priest’s
     breastplate. The seven lampstands are reminiscent of the lampstands
     in Solomon’s temple. The twenty-four elders remind us of the twenty-
     four divisions of service for the temple priests throughout the year and
     their prayer offering in the golden bowls of “incense” (Ps. 141:2).
     All of these verses point back to the Old Testament worship service,
     which centered around the earthly sanctuary.
        Finally, the slain Lamb of Revelation 5 points, of course, to Christ’s
     sacrificial death. Christ, the Lamb, is the only Mediator of divine sal-
     vation and is accounted worthy because of His triumph (Rev. 5:5), His
     sacrifice (Rev. 5:9, 12), and His divinity (Rev. 5:13).
        “Christ took upon Himself humanity, and laid down His life a sac-
     rifice, that man, by becoming a partaker of the divine nature, might
     have eternal life.”—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 3,
     p. 141.
        What we see in these two chapters, centering around God’s throne,
     is a depiction of God’s work for the salvation of humanity. We can
     see, too, that this work has unfolded before the other intelligent beings
     in heaven, a key theme in the great controversy motif.

      Think about what it means that Christ, as God Himself, took
      on our humanity and died as our Substitute; that is, what-
      ever wrongs you have done for which you yourself should be
      punished fell on Him instead. Why should this truth motivate
      everything that you do?

     Court Room
Read Psalm 11:4–7 and Habakkuk 2:20. What else does God do in
     His heavenly temple, and why is this important for us to know?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Many Psalms reveal that the Lord is not indifferent to the needs of
     the righteous or to the injustices that they often face. He will react to
     the issues that cry out for redress, and He will “ ‘justify the righteous
     and condemn the wicked,’ ” just as any good judge would do (Deut.
     25:1, NKJV).
        When God judges, the throne room becomes a courtroom and the
     heavenly throne, a judgment seat. The One enthroned is the One who
     judges (see Ps. 9:4–8), a concept known in the ancient Near East
     where kings often functioned as judges, as well.
        Divine judgment involves both the wicked and the righteous. While
     the wicked receive a punishment similar to that received by Sodom
     and Gomorrah, the upright “will behold His face” (Ps. 11:6, 7, NASB).
     The classic combination of throne room and judgment appears in
     Daniel 7:9–14 (a significant passage that we will study later). There
     again, the judgment consists of two strands: a verdict of vindication
     for the saints and a sentence of condemnation for God’s enemies.
        In the book of Habakkuk, after Habakkuk asks God why He is silent
     about injustice (Habakkuk 1), God answers that He will certainly
     judge (Hab. 2:1–5). While idols have no “breath” or “spirit” (Hab.
     2:19), the Creator God is enthroned in His temple, the heavenly sanc-
     tuary, and He is ready to judge.
        The prophetic appeal is, “ ‘Let all the earth be silent before Him’ ”
     (Hab. 2:20, NASB). The appropriate attitude toward God’s ruling and
     judging is awed silence and hushed reverence.
        The place where God reveals His special presence and where He
     is worshiped by the heavenly beings is the same place where He is
     rendering righteous judgment for all humans: the sanctuary in heaven.
     God is just, and all our questions about justice will be answered in
     God’s time, not ours.

      However much we cry out for justice, we often don’t see jus-
      tice in the present. Why, then, must we trust in God’s justice?
      Without that promise, what hope do we have?

     Place of Salvation
Read Hebrews 8:1, 2. What is Christ doing at the throne of God?

      ________________________________________________________

        The book of Hebrews teaches that Christ is ministering in the
     heavenly sanctuary as our High Priest. His work there is focused on
     our salvation, for He appears “in the presence of God for us” (Heb.
     9:24, NASB). He sympathizes with us, giving us assurance that we
     will not be rejected, but instead, receive mercy and grace (Heb.
     4:15, 16) because of what He has done for us. As in the earthly sanc-
     tuary, the heavenly one is where “atonement” (or “reconciliation”)
     is made for the sins of the believers (Heb. 2:17). The Jesus who died
     for us is the One now ministering in heaven “for us,” as well.

Read Revelation 1:12–20, 8:2–6, 11:19, and 15:5–8. What sanctuary
     imagery appears in these passages?

      ________________________________________________________

        The verses in today’s study are just some of the places in the book
     of Revelation where sanctuary imagery appears. In fact, most of the
     major sections of the book begin with or contain a sanctuary scene.
        The first introductory scene shows Christ, clothed as High Priest,
     walking among the seven lampstands (Rev. 1:12–20). The second
     shows the heavenly throne room, and the verses reveal a wide vari-
     ety of sanctuary imagery: throne, lamps, sea, slain Lamb, blood,
     and golden bowls of incense (Revelation 4, 5). The third scene
     refers to the continual service of intercession in the context of the
     first apartment of the heavenly sanctuary (Rev. 8:2–6). The fourth
     and central scene gives us a glimpse of the ark of the covenant in
     the second apartment (Rev. 11:19). The fifth scene brings the entire
     tabernacle in heaven into view (Rev. 15:5–8). The sixth scene is
     unique in that it does not contain any explicit references to the
     sanctuary, perhaps to illustrate that Christ’s work there is finished
     (Rev. 19:1–10). The final scene is all about the glorious Holy City
     on earth, which is portrayed as the tabernacle “coming down out of
     heaven” (Rev. 21:1–8, NASB).
        A careful study of these scenes reveals that they are interconnected,
     showing an internal progression in the salvation accomplished by
     God: from Christ on earth, to His heavenly ministry in the first and
     second apartments, to His high priestly ministry’s end, and finally to
     the new earth tabernacle.


                                                                         11

          glories there, the very best thing he could do was to not try to describe
          them. He tells us that eye had not seen nor ear heard, neither hath it
          entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for
          those that love Him. So you may put your imagination to the stretch,
          you may try to the very best of your abilities to take in and consider
          the eternal weight of glory, and yet your finite senses, faint and weary
          with the effort, cannot grasp it, for there is an infinity beyond. It takes
          all of eternity to unfold the glories and bring out the precious treasures
          of the Word of God.”—Ellen G. White, The SDA Bible Commentary,
          vol. 6, p. 1107.
1             “The abiding place of the King of kings, where thousand thousands
          minister unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stand before
          Him (Daniel 7:10); that temple, filled with the glory of the eternal
          throne, where seraphim, its shining guardians, veil their faces in
          adoration, could find, in the most magnificent structure ever reared
          by human hands, but a faint reflection of its vastness and glory. Yet
2         important truths concerning the heavenly sanctuary and the great
          work there carried forward for man’s redemption were taught by
          the earthly sanctuary and its services.”—Ellen G. White, The Great
          Controversy, p. 414.

    Discussion Questions:
           l
           1 Look at the last statement in Friday’s study from Ellen G.
           White. What does she mean when she says that many “important
3
           truths” for our salvation were taught in the earthly sanctuary
           and its services? What are some of those truths, and why are
           they important?

           l
           2 What does it mean that God “dwells” in heaven? How do you
           understand that concept?

           l
           3 This week’s lesson touched on the idea that the onlooking
           universe sees the work that God is doing in behalf of humanity.
           Why is that a crucial concept to grasp? How does this concept
           help us to understand the great controversy motif and what that
           motif means in the whole plan of salvation? What does it tell us
           about the character of God that He would leave His ways open
           to the scrutiny of beings that He, Himself, created?

The Rude Neighbor
   Jules and some choir members were going door-to-door to share their
faith in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo. As they approached
one home, a man yelled angrily, “I don’t want you here! Get out!” Jules
tried to talk to the man, but he shouted angry threats at them. Quietly the
believers left and went next door. The neighbor, Mangu, listened to the
choir members sing several spiritual songs. He thanked them and accepted
a pamphlet they offered.
   On Sabbath Jules and his friends returned to Mangu’s home to sing and
share their faith again. Simon, the neighbor who had been so rude to the
young people, saw the visitors in Mangu’s yard and walked over to see
what was happening. Mangu showed Simon the Bible study pamphlet.
   Simon asked Mangu for the pamphlet. “This one is mine,” Mangu said.
“Ask for your own.” Simon swallowed his embarrassment and invited the
Seventh-day Adventists to come to his house.
   “I saw the Bible lesson you gave Mangu,” Simon said. “I want to read
it too. I want to know what’s so special about Seventh-day Adventists.”
   Simon listened to Jules and his friends talk about Jesus. The young
people invited Simon and his family to join the choir’s Bible-study group.
“I’d like one of these pamphlets for my wife and each of my children,”
Simon said quietly.
   Jules smiled as he pulled out more Bible pamphlets. “Could we have
Bible studies here in our home?” Simon asked. Jules agreed. He and one
other young man returned to Simon’s home every week for a month.
Then Simon and his wife and children joined the Bible-study group at
the church.
   When the church announced evangelistic meetings, Simon and his fam-
ily attended every meeting. Simon and his wife asked to be baptized, and
later the couple’s three teenage children joined the church, as well.
                               Simon, the once-rude neighbor who wouldn’t
                            allow the youth into his home, now shares his
                            faith with anyone who will listen. He urged his
                            neighbor, Mangu, to check out the Seventh-day
                            Adventists, and Mangu now attends the Bible-
                            study group every week.
                               Our mission offerings help reach people
                            in difficult places such as Kinshasa, where
                            less than one in a thousand is a Seventh-day
                            Adventist Christian. Thank you for sharing.

      “Heaven” on Earth




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 1:31–2:3; Exod. 39:32,
      43; 25:9; Heb. 8:5; John 2:19–21; 1 Cor. 3:16, 17; Rev. 21:1–22.

Memory Text: “Who serve the copy and shadow of the heavenly
      things, as Moses was divinely instructed when he was about to
      make the tabernacle. For He said, ‘See that you make all things
      according to the pattern shown you on the mountain’ ” (Hebrews
      8:5, NKJV).



      T
             hough the sanctuary in heaven is the original, the one where
             God Himself is ministering “for us,” the Lord has revealed
             truths about this sanctuary in different ways to us here on earth.
        God created the Garden of Eden as a symbol of the sanctuary. The
      heavenly sanctuary and its function in salvation were represented
      in the earthly tabernacle and the larger structure of the Israelite
      temples.
        In Jesus, of course, the temple was made manifest in a human being.
      And, finally, the heavenly temple will come down to the new earth.
        As we will see, God has used concepts relating to the heavenly
      sanctuary to reveal truth. This week we will study some of those
      concepts.

*Study this week’s lesson to prepare for Sabbath, October 12.

The First “Sanctuary” on Earth
  Bible students have noted that many features of the Garden of
Eden correspond to the later sanctuaries in Israel, indicating that
Eden was the first symbolic “temple” on earth. Some parallels
between Eden and the sanctuary include:
  1. At the end of the Creation account and the report describing
     the construction of the wilderness tabernacle, the same three
     elements—approval, completion, and blessing—are expressed
     with the same key words (compare “all,” “finish,” and
     “bless” in Gen. 1:31–2:3 with Exod. 39:32, 43; 40:33).
  2. Just as God was “walking in the Garden” (Gen. 3:8, NASB),
     so He was in the midst of His people in the sanctuary (2 Sam.
     7:6, 7).
  3. Adam was to “tend” and “keep” the Garden (Gen. 2:15,
     NKJV). The same two verbs are used for the service of the
     Levites in the tabernacle (Num. 3:7, 8).
  4. Gardenlike imagery appears all throughout the sanctuary
     (Exod. 25:31–36, 1 Kings 6:18).
  5. Cherubim guarded the Garden (Gen. 3:24); two cherubim
     were stationed in the Most Holy Place (Exod. 25:18–22).
  6. Just as Creation took six days, each day being introduced by
     “God said” and all of them together followed by the Sabbath,
     so there are six “the Lord spoke to Moses” sections concerning
     the tabernacle (Exod. 25:1; 30:11, 17, 22, 34; 31:1), followed
     by a seventh section about the Sabbath (Exod. 31:12–17).
  7. The sanctuary was finished on the first day of the first month
     (Exod. 40:17), the Hebrew New Year’s Day, which recalls the
     completion of the world at Creation.
  Genesis 2 did not need to be explicit about these parallels; the
ancients understood them. For example, a Jewish writing of the
second century b.c. claims that “the garden of Eden was the holy
of holies and the dwelling of the Lord.”
  The Garden of Eden is called the “garden of God” (Isa. 51:3,
Ezek. 28:13, 31:9). It was God’s dwelling on earth, the place
where our first parents were intended to worship and commune
with Him. Therefore, the greatest loss of the Fall was not the
expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden but the loss of being
in the immediate presence of God.

 Dwell on the concept of the word sanctuary itself. What
 comes to your mind? What things form a “sanctuary” for
 you now? How does your understanding of these sanctuaries
 on earth help you to understand better what God’s sanctuary
 in heaven provides for us?
                                                                15

     Copy of the Pattern
Read Exodus 25:9, 40; Hebrews 8:5; 9:23, 24. What is the relation-
     ship between the earthly and heavenly sanctuaries?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        The Scriptures clearly teach that Moses did not invent the taber-
     nacle but built it according to the divine instruction that he received
     on the mountain (Exod. 26:30, 27:8, Num. 8:4). The earthly sanctu-
     ary was to be constructed after the “pattern” (Exod. 25:9, 40). The
     Hebrew word for “pattern” (tabnit) expresses the idea of a model or
     copy; thus, we can conclude that Moses saw some kind of miniature
     model that represented the heavenly sanctuary and that this model
     served as the pattern for the earthly one.
        Therefore, the heavenly temple is the original, the model for the
     Israelite sanctuaries. What is also obvious is that we cannot equate
     the sanctuary in heaven with heaven itself. The heavenly temple is
     “in heaven” (Rev. 11:19, 14:17, 15:5); thus, heaven contains it. The
     two are not synonymous.
        The book of Hebrews explains in unmistakable terms that the
     heavenly sanctuary is real. The sanctuary in heaven is called the
     “true tabernacle” (Heb. 8:2, NKJV), as well as the “greater and more
     perfect tabernacle” (Heb. 9:11, NKJV), while the earthly is a “copy
     and shadow” of the heavenly one (Heb. 8:5, NKJV). As a shadow
     is always a mere representation of something real, and an imper-
     fect and faint representation at that, the earthly sanctuary is a mere
     representation of the heavenly. Whatever its limitations, however,
     the earthly sanctuary does reflect the reality of the heavenly one in
     important ways.
        The relationship between the two is called typology. Typology is
     a divinely designed, prophetic prefiguration that involves two cor-
     responding historical realities, called type (original) and antitype
     (copy). Because the correspondence runs from the type (original) to
     the antitype (copy), we can see in Hebrews that the heavenly model
     that Moses had seen is referred to as “type” or “pattern” (Heb. 8:5)
     and the earthly sanctuary as “antitype” or “copy” (Heb. 9:24). This
     truth presents more evidence that the heavenly one existed prior to the
     earthly one. As Seventh-day Adventists, we are on solid biblical ground
     when we emphasize the physical reality of the heavenly sanctuary.

     Jesus as the Sanctuary
Read John 2:19–21. Why is Jesus’ body compared to the temple? See
     also John 1:14.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        One of the themes in the Gospel of John is that, with Jesus, the bet-
     ter “temple” has come. Tabernacle imagery is used as early as in John
     1:14. Jesus is the Word who “dwelt” among men, and they saw His
     “glory.” The Greek word used for “to dwell” (skenoo) is the verbal
     form of the Greek noun for “tabernacle” (skene); so, one could trans-
     late verse 14 as the Word “tabernacled among us.” In this context,
     the word glory recalls the glory of God that filled both the wilderness
     tabernacle (Exod. 40:34, 35) and Solomon’s temple at its inaugura-
     tion (2 Chron. 7:1–3). So, when Christ came to earth as a human, He
     fulfilled God’s temple promise to dwell among His people.
        As the texts above show, Jesus declared Himself to be the temple,
     signifying already the end of the earthly temple’s significance after
     His death (John 2:19–21, Matt. 27:51). Also, when Jesus said that
     He is the Bread of Life (John 6:35) and the Light of the world (John
     8:12), He might have been pointing beyond the manna on the table
     to the bread of the presence and the lampstand, objects in the earthly
     sanctuary. A definite reference to the sanctuary is the designation of
     Jesus as the sacrificial “Lamb of God” who will bear the sin of the
     world (John 1:29).
        “All who did service in connection with the sanctuary were being
     educated constantly in regard to the intervention of Christ in behalf of
     the human race. This service was designed to create in every heart a
     love for the law of God, which is the law of His kingdom. The sacrifi-
     cial offering was to be an object lesson of the love of God revealed in
     Christ—in the suffering, dying victim, who took upon Himself the sin
     of which man was guilty, the innocent being made sin for us.”—Ellen
     G. White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 233.

      Because of our sinful natures, it’s so easy to think that God is
      angry with us. How does the revelation of God’s love, as seen in
      the life and death of Jesus, help each of us to realize on a per-
      sonal level that God loves us despite our faults? In what ways
      should this realization encourage us to gain victories over self?

     The Church as the Sanctuary
       After Christ’s ascension to heaven and His inauguration as High
     Priest in the sanctuary there, the temple on earth no longer had any
     real purpose in the plan of salvation (see Matt. 27:50, 51). However,
     God still seeks to dwell among His people on earth, which was now
     possible through the Holy Spirit. The apostles use temple imagery to
     convey this truth.

Read 1 Corinthians 3:16, 17; 6:19, 20; 2 Corinthians 6:16; and
     Ephesians 2:19–22. Notice the sanctuary imagery in these texts.
     What truth does the Bible teach us here?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Paul speaks in 1 Corinthians 3:16, 17 to the church as a corporate
     unity, and he presents to them the temple themes of ownership (1 Cor.
     3:16) and of holiness (1 Cor. 3:17). He applies the same principles
     in 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20 to the individual believer. As a temple, the
     believer is holy terrain and, as such, is under divine obligation to
     live in holiness. Paul uses the temple imagery to emphasize his call
     for pure and holy living, which in this context he identifies as sexual
     purity over immorality (1 Cor. 6:15–18). Paul’s last reference to the
     church as a divine sanctuary fits into this pattern. There is no common
     ground between believers and unbelievers (2 Cor. 6:14–7:1), for the
     church is in a covenant relationship with God and, thus, is exclusively
     His (2 Cor. 6:18).
        At the same time, the church is not only God’s temple but also a
     holy priesthood (1 Pet. 2:5, 9). No doubt, with such a privilege as this,
     important responsibilities follow. How crucial that we surrender our
     lives in faith and obedience to the Lord who has given us so much and
     who, therefore, asks much of us in return.

      Of course, we are saved by Christ’s righteousness, which cov-
      ers us completely. However, because of what we have been
      given in Christ by grace, what does God ask of us in return?
      And even more important, how can we best do that which He
      asks of us?

     New Creation
Read Revelation 7:15–17. Where are the redeemed, and how does
     this passage portray them?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        These verses describe the redeemed as kings and priests who serve
     in God’s palace and temple (Rev. 1:6, 5:10, 20:6). The promise that
     “He who sits on the throne will spread His tabernacle over them”
     (Rev. 7:15, NASB) alludes to God’s presence in the wilderness sanctu-
     ary, where He dwelt among ancient Israel as its Leader. On the new
     earth, the sanctuary once more becomes the perfect place of relation-
     ship where God and the redeemed meet. It guarantees shelter, protec-
     tion, and the ultimate fulfillment of life in the presence of God and His
     Christ. The One who once tabernacled among men (John 1:14) now
     spreads the tabernacle over His saints so that they may “tabernacle”
     in His place.

Read Revelation 21:1–22. How is the New Jerusalem described?
     What parallels do you find between the Holy City and the sanctu-
     ary in these texts?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        John does not see a temple in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:22), but
     this does not mean that there is no temple. Rather, the New Jerusalem
     itself is the temple and the “tabernacle of God” (Rev. 21:3, NKJV).
     Several sanctuary elements are assigned to the New Jerusalem: it is
     “holy” and of heavenly origin (Rev. 21:2, 10); it has the same cubical
     form as did the Most Holy Place (Rev. 21:16, 1 Kings 6:20); similar to
     the temple precincts, “nothing unclean” is allowed into the city (Rev.
     21:27); and, most important of all, God is present. In the sanctuary of
     God, we can live with Him in the closest relationship possible (Rev.
     21:3, 7). This is the goal of salvation.

      An eternity in a close relationship with God? Why is it, then, so
      crucial for us to walk, as Ellen G. White says over and over, “in
      close communion with God” now?

         pp. 301–309, in Education; “The Controversy Ended,” pp. 673–678,
         in The Great Controversy.

            “A fear of making the future inheritance seem too material has led
         many to spiritualize away the very truths which lead us to look upon
         it as our home. Christ assured His disciples that He went to prepare
         mansions for them in the Father’s house. Those who accept the
         teachings of God’s word will not be wholly ignorant concerning the
         heavenly abode. And yet, ‘eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither
1
         have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath pre-
         pared for them that love Him.’ 1 Corinthians 2:9. Human language is
         inadequate to describe the reward of the righteous. It will be known
         only to those who behold it. No finite mind can comprehend the glory
         of the Paradise of God.”—Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy,

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Why do you think it is important for us to understand that
          God’s heavenly sanctuary is a real place? At the same time,
          why must we be careful not to make too detailed a comparison
          between the earthly temple and the heavenly temple?

3         l
          2 In class, dwell more on the idea of the church as a “sanctu-
          ary.” How do you understand this truth? Also, how can we as a
          church better fulfill this crucial teaching?

          l
          3 “Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the
          Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of
          God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which
          temple ye are” (1 Cor. 3:16, 17). What do these texts teach us,
          and how can we apply their teachings to the way that we live?

          l
          4 Dwell more on this idea that we are “priests” now and that we
          will function as priests after the Second Coming. What are those
          functions for us now, and what will they be after Jesus returns?
          Why does even the use of the word priests show us just how cen-
          tral the concept of the sanctuary is to the plan of salvation?

Faithful Little Flock
   In China, pastors often have several churches. Pastor Sun oversees 10
churches and 200 small groups with a membership of about 5,000. To
shepherd this large and diverse flock, Pastor Sun trains lay evangelists.
   Sister Xu found Christ and joined the Seventh-day Adventist church in
the provincial capital. She wanted to share her new faith with her family
and friends living in her hometown, Wu Yan, a city of about 100,000
people. When she arrived in Wu Yan, she found no other Seventh-day
Adventists living there. Undaunted, she shared her faith first with her
sister and then with others. Xu found several people who wanted to hear
about Christ, and she asked Pastor Sun to send someone to help her plant
a church in Wu Yan.
   Pastor Sun sent Liu, a Global Mission pioneer, to work with Xu. He met
with Xu’s sister and some neighbors in Xu’s home. Another neighbor reported
Liu’s activities to her own church officials, who made trouble for Liu.
   The little band of new believers prayed that God would protect the
infant flock, and Liu visited the neighbor’s church. He worshiped with
them and made friends in the congregation. Liu met several people who
were open to hearing what he believed, and he explained his work.
   One woman in the church, Zhang, asked for Bible studies. Liu studied with
her, and she in turn brought five others to meet Liu and study the Bible with
him. All six people from the neighbor’s church began keeping the Sabbath.
Liu encouraged them to continue attending their church on Sunday to find
other honest-hearted Christians who wanted to know what the Bible teaches.
   When the Sunday church’s leaders learned that more than 20 of their
members were studying to become Seventh-day Adventists, they were
angry and told them to stop attending their church. But the little group
continued telling others what they had discovered. The believers invited
                            their friends and those in need to come for
                             prayer and help.
                               In one year, more than 30 people are meet-
                             ing regularly on the Sabbath, and 18 have been
                             baptized. In China, a new believer must know
                             the Bible truths and pass an examination before
                             they are baptized, so 18 baptisms is remarkable.
                               Our mission offerings support the world
                             church in its challenging task of telling every-
                             one everywhere that Jesus loves them and died
                             to save them. Thank you for your part in sup-
                             porting missions around the world.

      Sacrifices



      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 3:9–21; Exod. 12:21–27;
      Lev. 2:1–3; Gen. 22:1–19; Lev. 17:10, 11; Phil. 4:18.

Memory Text: “I urge you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of
      God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable
      to God, which is your spiritual service of worship” (Romans 12:1,
      NASB).



      C
              entral to the entire gospel is the concept of sacrifice. In the
              biblical languages, the words for “sacrifice” often depict the
              idea of drawing near and of bringing something to God. The
      basic meaning of the Hebrew for offering or sacrifice describes the
      act of approaching, the act of bringing something into the presence of
      God. The Greek equivalent means “gift” and describes the presenta-
      tion of a sacrifice.
         Similarly, the English word offering comes from the Latin offerre,
      the presentation of a gift. The word sacrifice is a combination of the
      Latin sacer (holy) and facere (make) and refers to the act of making
      something sacred.
         This week we will look at some of the sacrifices that believers have
      offered to God. We will discover that God has always been calling for
      sacrifices, and He is still doing so today.
         Of course, and most important, God provided the ultimate sacrifice,
      that of Himself in the person of Jesus Christ.

     The First Sacrifice
Read Genesis 3:9–21. What was God’s response to Adam and Eve
     after they sinned?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Adam and Eve lived in a perfect world, in a sanctuary-like garden,
     and God granted them face-to-face communion with their Creator.
     Their first sin opened a nearly insurmountable breach in their relation-
     ship to God. However, God had already planned how to counter such
     a breach of trust, and even before there came any judgment against
     them, He gave them the hope of a Savior (Gen. 3:15).
        “Adam and Eve stood as criminals before their God, awaiting the
     sentence which transgression had incurred. But before they hear of
     the thorn and the thistle, the sorrow and anguish which should be
     their portion, and the dust to which they should return, they listen to
     words which must have inspired them with hope. Though they must
     suffer . . . , they might look forward to ultimate victory.”—Ellen G.
     White, That I May Know Him, p. 16.
        The Lord showed them the ultimate foundation of that victory
     when, immediately after His judgment speech, He made for them gar-
     ments of skin to cover their nakedness and shame. Although unstated,
     it may be reasonable to assume that an innocent animal had to die for
     this, and perhaps even that it was understood as a kind of sacrifice
     (Gen. 3:21).
        God’s provision of clothes for the culprits became a symbolic act.
     Just as the sacrifices in the desert sanctuary guaranteed the special
     relationship between God and His people, so the clothing in the Garden
     assured the guilty of God’s unchanging goodwill toward them.
        So, from the earliest days of human history, sacrifices taught that
     sinful humans could find union with God, but only through the death
     of Jesus, who was prefigured in those sacrifices.

      Reread Genesis 3:9–21. What does it say to you that even before
      God spoke any words of judgment to the guilty pair, He gave
      them the promise of “ultimate victory”? What does this say
      about God’s attitude toward us, even in our fallen state?

      Types of Offerings
         In Old Testament times, believers could bring offerings on different
      occasions and in different personal circumstances. Different objects
      they were allowed to “offer” included clean animals, grain, or drink,
      as well as other things. The animal sacrifice is the oldest element in
      the sanctuary service, and together with the priestly service, belongs
      at the center of the Israelite service. Religious life without sacrifice
      was inconceivable.

Which kinds of offerings are described in the following texts? Exod.
      12:21–27, Lev. 2:1–3, Exod. 25:2–7, Lev. 4:27–31.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         God established the sacrificial system so that believers could enter
      into a close relationship with Him. This is why offerings could be
      brought in all different kinds of situations: for thanksgiving, for an
      expression of joy and celebration, for a gift, for a petition for forgive-
      ness, for a penitential plea, for a symbol of dedication, or for restitu-
      tion.
         Among the most important types of offerings were the burnt offer-
      ing (Leviticus 1) and the grain offering (Leviticus 2), as well as the
      peace, or well-being offering (Leviticus 3), the purification offering
      (Leviticus 4), and the reparation (trespass) offering (Lev. 5:14–6:7).
      The first three were voluntary offerings, which were to remind the
      giver (and us) that, in the end, everything that we are and all that we
      have belong to God. The burnt offering symbolizes the total dedica-
      tion of the one making the offering. The grain offering symbolizes
      the dedication of our material possessions to God, whether they be
      food, animals, or something else. The well-being offering is the only
      sacrifice in which the participant receives a part of the offering for
      personal consumption.
         The other two sacrifices were obligatory. They reminded the
      people that, though wrongs have consequences, those wrongs can be
      “healed.” The purification offering, often called “sin offering,” was
      offered after ritual defilement or after the person became aware of a
      moral defilement through sin.

       The widespread function of the offerings shows that every
       aspect of our lives must come under God’s control. How can
       you learn to surrender completely everything you have, or are,
       to Him? What happens when you don’t do this?

     Sacrifice at Moriah
Read Genesis 22:1–19. What did Abraham learn about sacrifice?
      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        What was God’s purpose in this incredible challenge to Abraham’s
     faith? The patriarch’s life with God had always been accompanied by
     divine promises: the promise of land, of descendants, and of bless-
     ings; the promise of a son; and the promise that God would take care
     of Ishmael. Abraham sacrificed, but it was always in the light of some
     promise. However, in the situation described in Genesis 22, Abraham
     did not get any divine promise; instead, he was told to sacrifice the
     living promise, his son. Following through on God’s command,
     Abraham showed that God was more important to him than anything
     else.
        “It was to impress Abraham’s mind with the reality of the gospel,
     as well as to test his faith, that God commanded him to slay his son.
     The agony which he endured during the dark days of that fearful trial
     was permitted that he might understand from his own experience
     something of the greatness of the sacrifice made by the infinite God
     for man’s redemption. No other test could have caused Abraham
     such torture of soul as did the offering of his son. God gave His Son
     to a death of agony and shame.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and
     Prophets, p. 154.
        Concerning the sacrifice, Abraham understood two essential prin-
     ciples. First, no one but God Himself can bring the true sacrifice and
     the means of salvation. It is the Lord who will, who must, provide.
     Abraham eternalizes this principle by naming the place, “YHWH
     Jireh,” which means “The-Lord-Will-Provide.” Second, the actual
     sacrifice is substitutional, one that saves Isaac’s life. The ram is
     offered “in the place of ” Isaac (Gen. 22:13, NASB). That animal,
     which God provided, prefigures the Lamb of God, Jesus Christ, on
     whom “the Lord has laid . . . the iniquity of us all” (Isa. 53:6, 7; Acts
     8:32, NKJV).

      What an astonishing surrender to God! Who can imagine what
      that experience must have been like for Abraham? Think about
      the last time that you had to reach out in sheer faith and do
      something that caused you a lot of anguish. What did you learn
      from your actions, and how well has the lesson stuck?

     Life for a Life
Read Leviticus 17:10, 11. What function does God give to the blood?
      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        In a passage where God instructs the Israelites not to eat any blood,
     He provides an interesting reason for this prohibition: blood stands for
     life, and God has made sacrificial blood a ransom for human life. One
     life, represented by the blood, ransoms another life. The principle of
     substitution, which became explicit on Mount Moriah when Abraham
     offered the blood of the ram in the place of the blood of his son, is
     firmly anchored in God’s legal requirements for ancient Israel.
        As in Genesis 22, God shows that it is He Himself who provides
     the means for atonement; in the Hebrew, the I in “ ‘ “I have given it
     to you” ’ ” (Lev. 17:11, NKJV) is emphasized. We cannot provide our
     own ransom. God must give it.
        The concept is different from that of other religions that use sacri-
     fices. In the Bible, it is not a human who approaches God and knows
     how to appease Him; it is God, rather, who provides the means for
     a person to come into His holy presence. And in Christ, He Himself
     provides the blood for ransom.

Read 1 Samuel 15:22 and Micah 6:6–8. What are some of the dan-
     gers of the ritual system?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        God never intended the sacrificial service to be a substitute for the atti-
     tude of the heart; on the contrary, the sacrifices were to open the heart of
     the believer to the Lord. If we lose sight of the fact that sacrifices express
     a spiritual relationship between God and us and that they all point to a
     much greater sacrifice, Jesus Christ, we could easily mistake the sacrifi-
     cial ritual for an automatic apparatus for making atonement. Besides sac-
     rifice, God really wants our hearts to be right with Him (Ps. 51:16, 17).
     Consistently the Israelite prophets accused the people of false piety and
     called for them “to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly
     with your God” (Mic. 6:6–8, NRSV; compare Isa. 1:10–17).

      In what ways do we face the same danger as expressed above?
      Why is it often so hard to realize that we could be doing exactly
      what the ancient Israelites did in this area? How can we avoid
      this mistake?

     Sacrifices Today/Living Sacrifice
       Though after Christ’s sacrificial death there was no more need for
     animal sacrifices, the New Testament does talk about the need for
     another kind of sacrifice instead.

According to these texts, what kind of offerings are we to bring to
     God today? Rom. 12:1, 2; Phil. 4:18; Heb. 13:15, 16; 1 Pet. 2:5.
      ________________________________________________________
      ________________________________________________________
      ________________________________________________________

       Terminology from the sacrificial system worked very well in
     describing the early Christian concept of what it meant to live a life
     totally consecrated to God. In fact, even when Paul was thinking
     about his martyrdom, he described himself as a drink offering (Phil.
     2:17, 2 Tim. 4:6).

What specific message is given to us in Romans 12:1? In what ways
     are we to manifest this truth in our own lives?
      ________________________________________________________
      ________________________________________________________
      ________________________________________________________

        A “living sacrifice” means that the entire person is given to God. It
     includes the dedication of the body (Rom. 12:1) as well as the trans-
     formation of the inner being (vs. 2). We are to be set apart (“holy”)
     for the sole purpose of serving the Lord. Christians will present
     themselves wholly to the Lord because of the “mercies of God,” as
     described in Romans 12:1–11, which presents Christ as our Sacrifice,
     the means of our salvation.
        In this context, Paul’s appeal is for Christians to imitate Christ. A
     true understanding of God’s grace leads to a life consecrated to God
     and to a loving service for others. Surrender of self and the desires
     of self to the will of God is the only reasonable response to Christ’s
     ultimate sacrifice for us.
        In the end, there has to be a harmony between our understanding
     of spiritual and doctrinal truth and our service to others. Every aspect
     of life should express the believer’s genuine commitment to God.
     True worship is never only inward and spiritual; it must encompass
     outward acts of selfless service. After all, think about what our Lord
     has done for us.
                                                                         27

    Further Study: “It had been difficult even for the angels to grasp
         the mystery of redemption—to comprehend that the Commander of
         heaven, the Son of God, must die for guilty man. When the command
         was given to Abraham to offer up his son, the interest of all heavenly
         beings was enlisted. With intense earnestness they watched each step
         in the fulfillment of this command. When to Isaac’s question, ‘Where
         is the lamb for a burnt offering?’ Abraham made answer, ‘God will
         provide Himself a lamb;’ and when the father’s hand was stayed as he
         was about to slay his son, and the ram which God had provided was
         offered in the place of Isaac—then light was shed upon the mystery
1        of redemption, and even the angels understood more clearly the won-
         derful provision that God had made for man’s salvation.”—Ellen G.
         White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 155.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 “Our feet will walk in his paths, our lips will speak the truth
2         and spread the gospel, our tongues will bring healing, our hands
          will lift up those who have fallen, and perform many mundane
          tasks as well like cooking and cleaning, typing and mending; our
          arms will embrace the lonely and the unloved, our ears will listen
          to the cries of the distressed, and our eyes will look humbly and
          patiently towards God.”—John Stott, Romans (Downers Grove,
          Ill.: InterVarsity, 1994), p. 322. In what ways does this quote
          show what it means to be a “living sacrifice”? Why is it that only
3         through death to self could we ever be able to live like this?

          l
          2 As we saw during the week’s lesson, one of the great prob-
          lems that the people faced was seeing the sacrificial system as
          an end in itself instead of a means to an end—that end being
          a life wholly consecrated to God, a consecration that reveals
          itself in loving service to others. In what ways are Seventh-day
          Adventists (who have been given so much light), especially in
          danger of going down the same path, because perhaps we now
          think that the great truths we possess are an end in and of them-
          selves, instead of a means to the end?

          l
          3 Dwell more on the story of Abraham and Isaac on Mount
          Moriah. However troubling this story is, one could argue that it
          was meant to be troubling, to cause consternation and distress.
          Why do you think anyone would argue that it was meant, among
          other things, to evoke those emotions in the reader?

Best Friends for Jesus
  Moses is eight years old. He and his family live in the tiny country
of Armenia, tucked between Turkey, Georgia, and Azerbaijan.
  Moses and his family had just moved to a little village in western
Armenia. Moses didn’t know anyone there. Then he met Hayk [hike],
a boy his own age. The two boys quickly became friends. They enjoy
playing and riding their bicycles together.
  Moses realized that Hayk didn’t know Jesus. His family didn’t go to
church. So, Moses started praying for his friend. He wanted to invite
Hayk to church, but first he decided to give Hayk a book about Jesus.
  Hayk liked the book and started reading it even before Moses left his
house. Mother noticed that Hayk read late into the evening and again
the next day. The book has lots of pictures that held Hayk’s interest.
  Later when Hayk visited, Mother asked the boys some questions
about stories she knew were in the book, and Hayk answered them all.
Hayk said that he tells his mother the stories that he reads, and now his
mother and sister want to read the book too.
  A few days later, Hayk asked Moses, “May I go to church with
you?”
  Moses was surprised and happy. “Of course you can!” Moses said.
“I was going to invite you!”
  Hayk loves church and wants to go every Sabbath. Children in
Armenia don’t have lesson quarterlies, so the teacher must read the
lesson in Russian and tell it to the children in Armenian.
  Hayk is so excited about what he’s learning in church that he’s
invited some of his friends to go with him. One week, five boys and
girls attended church with Hayk, and he’s looking for more children to
                           invite.
                              Moses invited Hayk, and now the boys are
                           inviting others. And the church in Armenia
                           is growing.
                              Our offerings help support outreach in
                           countries where Seventh-day Adventist mem-
                           bership is small. Thank you for stretching the
                           arms of mission around the world through
                           your offerings.


                               Moses and Hayk (left) share their faith in a small town in
                               western Armenia.

     Place of the Presence
According to Exodus 25:8, what was the purpose of the earthly
     sanctuary in the wilderness? What amazing truth does this teach
     us about God’s love for us?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        In the Garden of Eden, sin had broken the face-to-face relationship
     between God and humanity. Sin forfeited our first parents’ unhindered
     communion with God. However, the Creator still desired to draw us to
     Himself and to enjoy a deep covenant relationship with fallen human-
     ity, and He began this process right there in Eden. Centuries later,
     in saving Israel out of Egypt and establishing the sanctuary and the
     sacrificial system, God again took the initiative in bringing humanity
     back into His presence.
        The sanctuary thus testifies of God’s unceasing desire to dwell
     among His people. This is God’s idea (Ps. 132:13, 14). His ultimate
     goal is relationship, and the sanctuary services were His chosen
     means to illustrate that relationship. The sanctuary is the tangible
     evidence of God’s presence with His people on earth.
        From the description in Numbers 2, it is evident that the tabernacle
     was located in the center of the square encampment where, as was
     customary in the ancient Near East, the king would place his tent. So,
     the tabernacle symbolizes that God is the King over Israel.
        The Levites, meanwhile, placed their tents around the tabernacle
     (Num. 1:53), and the other tribes put theirs farther around at a “dis-
     tance” in groups of three (Num. 2:2). This illustrates in a tangible way
     both the nearness and the distance of God.
        Another purpose of the sanctuary was to provide a location for
     a centralized, divinely ordained system of worship. Because God’s
     presence in the midst of the people was jeopardized by their impu-
     rities and moral failings, He provided a system of sacrifices and
     offerings through which unholy people could live and remain in the
     presence of a Holy God.
        So, in this context, the sanctuary revealed details regarding the plan of
     redemption, which included not only the sacrifices but the ministry of the
     priesthood, which was an integral part of the plan of redemption, as well.

      With the sanctuary, the Creator of the universe, the One who
      made all that was made (see John 1:1–3), lowered Himself to
      dwell among homeless wanderers in the desert. How should
      this fact alone help us avoid harboring ethnic, class, or cultural
      prejudices against anyone?
                                                                             31

     “Be Ye Holy”
       “And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the taber-
     nacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels
     thereof: and it shall be holy.
       “And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all
     his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most
     holy” (Exod. 40:9, 10).

        Exodus 40:9, 10 shows us that the sanctuary was to be regarded as
     “holy.” The basic idea of holiness is separateness and uniqueness, in
     combination with one’s belonging to God.
        “The typical service was the connecting link between God and
     Israel. The sacrificial offerings were designed to prefigure the sac-
     rifice of Christ, and thus to preserve in the hearts of the people an
     unwavering faith in the Redeemer to come. Hence, in order that the
     Lord might accept their sacrifices, and continue His presence with
     them, and, on the other hand, that the people might have a correct
     knowledge of the plan of salvation, and a right understanding of their
     duty, it was of the utmost importance that holiness of heart and purity
     of life, reverence for God, and strict obedience to His requirements,
     should be maintained by all connected with the sanctuary.”—Ellen G.
     White Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2, p. 1010.

Read Leviticus 19:2 and 1 Peter 1:14–16. What is the primary reason
     for the people to be holy?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        God’s holiness transforms us and sets us apart. His holiness is the
     ultimate motivation for the ethical conduct of His people in all spheres
     of life (see Leviticus 19), whether that be observing the dietary laws
     (Lev. 11:44, 45), respecting the priest (Lev. 21:8), or not conforming
     to former lusts (1 Pet. 1:14). Obviously, God wants us to grow in holi-
     ness as we become closer to Him. This change can come about only
     through a self-surrender of our sinful natures and through a willing-
     ness to do what is right, regardless of the consequences.

      Think about yourself, your habits, your tastes, your activities,
      et cetera. How much of what you are, and what you do, would
      be considered “holy”? It is kind of a tough question to face,
      isn’t it?

     Instruments of the Sanctuary
Read Exodus 31:2–11. What do these verses teach us about the mak-
     ing of the objects in the earthly sanctuary? What link is there with
     Genesis 1:2? See also Exod. 25:9.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Of all the objects in the sanctuary, the ark of the testimony was the
     supreme symbol of God’s presence and holiness. The name derives
     from the two stone tablets of the law, called the “testimony” (Exod.
     32:15, 16), that were placed inside the ark (Exod. 25:16, 21).
        On top of the ark was placed the “mercy seat,” with two cherubim
     overshadowing the cover with their wings (Exod. 25:17–21). It is
     appropriately called the “atonement cover” (NIV), for it conveys the
     idea that our compassionate and gracious God has reconciled the
     people with Himself and made every provision for them to maintain a
     covenant relationship with Him.
        This is the place where, once a year, on the Day of Atonement
     (Yom Kippur in the Hebrew), atonement for the people and the sanc-
     tuary took place (Lev. 16:14–16). In Romans 3:25, Paul refers to Jesus
     as “atonement cover” (usually translated as “propitiation” or “sacri-
     fice of atonement”), for Jesus Himself is the place of Redemption, the
     One through whom God has made atonement for our sins.
        In the Holy Place, the first compartment, the lampstand continually
     provided light (Lev. 24:1–4), and the altar of incense produced the
     protective smoke that concealed the presence of God from the priest
     (Lev. 16:12, 13). On the table for the bread of the presence were
     placed twelve loaves of bread, representing the twelve tribes of Israel.
     Dishes, pans, jars, and bowls (Exod. 25:29, 30) also were placed on
     the table. Although little information is given about the significance
     of these items, it seems that they represented the elements of a cov-
     enant meal (recalling Exod. 24:11) and served as a constant reminder
     of God’s covenant with the people.

      Read Romans 3:25–28. What great hope can we take from the
      promise of salvation “by faith apart from the deeds of the law”?
      (NKJV).

      Center of Divine and Communal
      Activity
Read 1 Kings 8:31–53. What more does this text teach us about the
      function of the sanctuary?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        At the dedication ceremony of the newly built temple, King
      Solomon offered seven kinds of specific prayers that could be offered
      at the temple. The seven functions exemplify the extensive role of
      the temple in the lives of the Israelites. The temple was a place for
      seeking forgiveness (vs. 30); for oath swearing (vss. 31, 32); for sup-
      plication when defeated (vss. 33, 34); for petition when faced with
      drought (vss. 35, 36) or other disasters (vss. 37–40). It was also a place
      for the foreigner to pray (vss. 41–43), as well as a place to petition for
      victory (vss. 44, 45).
        That the temple was intended to be a “ ‘house of prayer for all
      the peoples’ ” (Isa. 56:7, NASB) becomes evident from the fact that
      Solomon envisioned the individual Israelite, the foreigner, and the
      entire population as petitioners.

The sanctuary was the ideological center of basically all activity in
      Israel. Religion was not just part of the believer’s life, even if it
      was a major part; it was life. What does this tell us about the role
      that our faith should play in our own lives?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        When the people wanted to receive advice or judgment, or if they
      repented of their sins, they went to the sanctuary. The sanctuary
      was also the hub of life during the desert years of Israel. When God
      desired to communicate to His people, He did so from the sanctuary
      (Exod. 25:22). Therefore, it is appropriately called the “tent of meet-
      ing” (for example, Lev. 1:1, NASB).

       Think about your prayer life. How deep, how rich, how faith-
       affirming and life changing is it? Perhaps the first question
       you need to ask yourself is: how much time do I spend in
       prayer?

     “Until I Went Into the Sanctuary of
     God”
        Time and again, the Psalms show that the sanctuary plays a signifi-
     cant part in the relationship between believers and God. Well known
     is the firm conviction David expressed at the end of Psalm 23 that he
     “will dwell in the house of the Lord forever” (vs. 6, NKJV). David’s
     foremost wish in Psalm 27 was to be in the presence of Yahweh,
     a presence which was best experienced in the sanctuary. In order
     to show how much he cherished the sanctuary, David used the full
     range of expressions to refer to it, calling it the house of the Lord, the
     temple, the tabernacle, and the tent. It is there that one can meditate
     and “behold the beauty of the Lord” (Ps. 27:4, NKJV).
        The activities of God in the sanctuary illustrate some crucial points:
     He keeps the worshiper safe and hides him in His sanctuary, even in
     tough times (Ps. 27:5). God provides secure refuge and assures peace
     of mind for all who come into His presence. These expressions con-
     nect the beauty of God to what He does for His people. In addition,
     the sanctuary service with its symbolic significance shows the good-
     ness and justice of God.
        The ultimate object of David’s deepest desire was not only simply
     to be in the sanctuary but for Yahweh to be present with him. That is
     why David resolves to “seek” God (Ps. 27:4, 8).

Read Psalm 73:1–17. Which insights did Asaph receive after enter-
     ing the sanctuary?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        In Psalm 73, Asaph addressed the problem of suffering. He could
     not understand the apparent success of the wicked (vss. 4–12) while the
     faithful were afflicted. He himself almost slipped (vss. 1–3), but going
     into the sanctuary made the difference for him (vss. 13–17). There,
     Asaph could see the same power and glory of God that David mentions
     in Psalm 63:2 and recognize that the present conditions will one day
     change and justice will be done. He could reflect anew on the truth and
     receive reaffirmation that, in the end, the wicked are on slippery ground
     (Ps. 73:18–20) and the faithful are secure (vss. 21–28). For those who
     seek God, the sanctuary becomes a place of confidence and a strong-
     hold of life, one where God will set them “high upon a rock” (Ps. 27:5,
     NKJV). From the truth that the sanctuary service teaches, we can indeed
     learn to trust in the goodness and the justice of God.
                                                                           35

    Further Study: Ellen G. White, “The Tabernacle and Its Services,”
         pp. 343–358, in Patriarchs and Prophets.

            “For the building of the sanctuary great and expensive prepara-
         tions were necessary; a large amount of the most precious and costly
         material was required; yet the Lord accepted only freewill offerings.
         ‘Of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take
         My offering’ was the divine command repeated by Moses to the
         congregation. Devotion to God and a spirit of sacrifice were the first
         requisites in preparing a dwelling place for the Most High.”—Ellen
         G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 343.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Dwell more on the question of God’s justice. We see so little
          justice in this world now. Why, then, without the ultimate hope
          of God’s justice, would there be no hope of justice at all?
2
          l
          2 Someone wrote: “The tabernacle is a piece of holy ground
          amid a world that has lost its way.” What does that mean to
          you?

          l
          3 Read 1 Peter 1:14–16. In what way do you understand God’s
          holiness? What does it mean to be holy yourself? How can we
          become holy?
3
          l
          4 The sons of Eli are an example of people who were “close”
          to God but who lost their appreciation of His holiness (1 Sam.
          2:12–17). How can you avoid losing a sense of God’s holiness?
          Why are prayer, study, and obedience crucial in helping us to
          preserve the awareness of His holiness?

          l
          5 “The most important part of the daily ministration was the
          service performed in behalf of individuals. The repentant sinner
          brought his offering to the door of the tabernacle, and placing
          his hand upon the victim’s head, confessed his sins, thus in figure
          transferring them from himself to the innocent sacrifice. By his
          own hand the animal was then slain, and the blood was carried
          by the priest into the holy place and sprinkled before the veil,
          behind which was the ark containing the law that the sinner
          had transgressed. By this ceremony the sin was, through the
          blood, transferred in figure to the sanctuary.”—Ellen G. White,
          Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 354. How does this quote help us to
          understand the ways in which “salvation by faith” was revealed
          in the sanctuary service?

Persecuted and Victorious
   “Hang the heretics!” the angry mob shouted, shoving my neighbor and
me toward a makeshift gallows. Rough hands slipped a noose over my
head and shouted, “Now will you repent?”
   “No!” I said, and the noose drew tighter around my neck.
   Months earlier I noticed a man reading a Bible on a bus. He saw my
interest and urged me to buy a Bible and discover God’s truths for myself.
Then he invited me to visit the Seventh-day Adventist church. I bought a
Bible and began reading, eager to share what I was learning with others.
   On Sabbath my wife and I walked two hours to the next village to visit
the Seventh-day Adventist church. Church members gave me eight Bibles
to share, and a layman offered to come to the village and study with us.
   I gave out the Bibles and invited my neighbors to study with me. Soon
my house was full of people who wanted to know God’s Word! But when
the local village leaders learned of the Bible study, they accused us of
making trouble and threatened us. The next day an angry mob came to
arrest my neighbor and me.
   We were told to renounce our faith. We refused, and the men placed the
ropes around our necks. As I prayed for my family and the new believers,
someone cut the ropes. They let my friend go, but they beat me and threat-
ened me. Still I refused to deny Christ.
   Eventually they let me go, but as I hurried toward home I noticed some
villagers following me with machetes. I ducked behind some tall bushes and
ran home, where the Seventh-day Adventist layman waited with my wife.
   “Come and stay in our town for a while,” he urged. We gathered some
clothes and our animals, and we escaped to the neighboring village, where
we stayed until the church could work out a solution with our village
leaders. At night we sneaked back home to harvest our crops so we would
have food. Soon my wife and I were baptized.
                              When it was safe, we returned home, free to
                            worship and share our faith with friends and
                            family. The village leaders gave us land, and we
                            built a church. Today more than three hundred
                            Seventh-day Adventists, and many visitors wor-
                            ship with us!
                              We praise God for turning persecution into
                            praise. Part of a recent Thirteenth Sabbath

      Atonement: Purification
      Offering


      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: 2 Chron. 33:12, 13; 2 Sam.
      14:1–11; Lev. 4:27–31; Jer. 17:1; Lev. 10:16–18; Mic. 7:18–20.

Memory Text: “Knowing that you were not redeemed with perish-
      able things like silver or gold from your futile way of life inher-
      ited from your forefathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb
      unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ” (1 Peter 1:18, 19,
      NASB).



      T
             he sacrificial system is probably the best-known part of the
             sanctuary service because it’s the part that points directly to
             Christ’s sacrifice. The blood of the animal that died for the sin-
      ner becomes a symbol for the blood of Christ, who died for us.
        This week we will study several concepts linked to the “purification
      offering” (also called “sin offering”), which was God’s appointed way
      of helping us to understand better how He is reconciling us to Himself
      through the only true Sacrifice, Jesus Christ. At times, this lesson uses
      the term “purification offering” instead of “sin offering” to avoid the
      impression that an act that required an offering, such as giving birth,
      be regarded as a moral fault (Lev. 12:5–8). Such a sacrifice is best
      understood as a purification offering for a woman’s ritual impurity
      and not as a sacrifice because of sin.

*Study this week’s lesson to prepare for Sabbath, November 2.

     Sin and Mercy
       As anyone who knows the Lord can testify, sin separates us from
     God. The good news is that the Lord has put in place a system to heal
     the breach caused by sin and to bring us back to Him. At the center of
     this system is, of course, the sacrifice.
       There are basically three kinds of sin depicted in the Old Testament,
     each corresponding to the sinner’s level of awareness while he or she
     committed the transgression: inadvertent or unintentional sin, deliber-
     ate or intentional sin, and rebellious sin. The “purification offering”
     prescribed in Leviticus 4:1–5:13 applied to cases of unintentional sin,
     as well as some cases of deliberate sin (Lev. 5:1). While an offering
     was available for these first two categories, none is mentioned for
     rebellious sin, the most heinous kind. Rebellious sin was done “in
     the face” of God, with a high hand, and the rebel deserved nothing
     less than to be cut off (Num. 15:29–31). However, it seems that even
     in these cases, such as with Manasseh, God offered forgiveness (see
     2 Chron. 33:12, 13).

Read Deuteronomy 25:1, 2 and 2 Samuel 14:1–11. What does 2 Samuel
     14:9 reveal about mercy, justice, and guilt?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Is God justified in forgiving the sinner? After all, is not the sinner
     unrighteous and therefore worthy of being condemned (see Deut. 25:1)?
        The story of the woman of Tekoa can illustrate the answer. Pretending
     to be a widow as instructed by Joab, this woman went to King David,
     seeking his judgment. Joab contrived a story that he asked her to tell
     David, about her two sons, one having killed the other. Israelite law
     demanded the death of the murderer (Num. 35:31), even though he was
     the only male left in the family. The woman pleaded with David (who
     functioned as judge) to let the guilty son go free.
        Then, interestingly enough, she declared: “ ‘Let the iniquity be on
     me and on my father’s house, and the king and his throne be guilt-
     less’ ” (2 Sam. 14:9, NKJV). Both the woman and David understood
     that if the king would decide to let the murderer go free, then the king
     himself would acquire the guilt of the murderer and that his throne
     of justice (that is, his reputation as judge) would be in jeopardy. The
     judge was morally responsible for what he decided. That is why the
     woman offered to take over this guilt herself.
        Similarly, God takes over the guilt of sinners in order to declare them
     righteous. For us to be forgiven, God Himself must bear our punishment.
     This is the legal reason why Christ had to die if we were to be saved.
                                                                           39

        The goal of the offering was to remove sin and guilt from the
     sinner, to transfer responsibility to the sanctuary, and to let the
     sinner leave forgiven and cleansed. (In extremely rare cases, one
     could bring a certain amount of fine flour as a purification offer-
     ing. Although this purification offering was bloodless, it was
     understood that “without shedding of blood there is no forgive-
     ness” [Heb. 9:22, NASB]).
        The ritual itself included the laying on of hands, the death of
     the animal, blood manipulation, the burning of fat, and the eating
     of the animal’s flesh. The sinner who brought the offering was
     granted forgiveness, but only after the blood ritual.
        A crucial part of this process involved the laying on of hands (Lev.
     1:4, 4:4, 16:21). This was done so that the offering “may be accepted
     for him to make atonement on his behalf ” (Lev. 1:4, NASB). The
     offering applied only for the one who put his hands on the animal’s
     head. According to Leviticus 16:21, the laying on of hands would
     be accompanied by a confession of sin; this would acknowledge the
     transfer of sin from the sinner to the innocent animal.
        The slaughter was, of course, basic to any animal offering.
     After the animal was killed, the spilled blood was used to make
     atonement on the altar (Lev. 17:11). Because the sins had been
     transferred to the animal by the laying on of hands, we should
     understand the death of the animal as a substitutionary death. The
     animal died in the place of the sinner. This may explain why the
     act of killing the animal had to be performed by the sinner, or the
     guilty one, and not by the priest.

      Next time you are tempted to sin, envision Jesus dying on
      the cross and see yourself putting your hands on His head
      and confessing your sins over Him. How might this concept,
      played out in your mind, help you to understand just what it
      cost in order to be forgiven? How could this idea help you to
      resist succumbing to that temptation?

Transfer of Sin
  “The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the
point of a diamond: it is graven upon the table of their heart, and
upon the horns of your altars” (Jer. 17:1).

   After the laying on of hands and the death of the animal, the next
ritual activity in the offering was the handling of the blood. The priest
applied the sacrificial blood to the horns of the altar. Because blood
was involved, this ritual part had to do with atonement (Lev. 17:11). If
the sinner was a commoner or a leader, the blood was applied on the
altar of burnt offering (Lev. 4:25, 30); if the high priest or the entire
congregation was the sinner, the blood was applied to the inner altar,
the altar of incense (Lev. 4:7, 18).
   What did it mean to smear blood on the horns of the altar? The
horns were the highest points of the altar and, as such, could signify
the vertical dimension of salvation. In this way, the blood was brought
into the presence of God.
   Jeremiah 17:1 is of particular importance for understanding what hap-
pens: the sin of Judah is engraved “upon the tablet of their heart, and on
the horns of their altars” (NASB). Although the text is referring to altars
involved in idolatrous worship, the principle remains the same: the altar
reflected the moral condition of the people. Blood transferred the guilt
of sin. The blood smeared on the horns of the altar transferred sin away
from the sinner to the sanctuary, a crucially important truth in order for
us to understand the plan of salvation as revealed in the earthly sanctuary
service, which symbolizes the work of Christ in heaven for us.
   Because the blood carried sin, it also defiled the sanctuary. We find
an example of this defiling in cases where the blood of the purification
offering splashed accidentally on a garment. The garment needed to
be cleansed, not just anywhere, but only “in a holy place” (Lev. 6:27,
NKJV).
   Finally, the burning of the fat on the altar indicated that everything
relating to the purification offering belonged to God (Lev. 3:16).
   Thanks to the death of Jesus, symbolized by these sacrifices, our sin
has been taken away from us, placed on Him, and transferred to the
heavenly sanctuary. This is central to the plan of salvation.

 How does the sanctuary service help us to understand our utter
 dependence on God for forgiveness of our sins? What comfort
 does this truth bring you? At the same time, what important
 responsibilities follow? See 1 Peter 1:22.

     Bearing Sin
Read Leviticus 6:25, 26; 10:16–18. What crucial truth is revealed
     here?

      ________________________________________________________

        By eating the offering at a holy place, the officiating priest would
     “bear away the guilt” of the offender. The meat of this offering was
     not just payment for the priests’ services (otherwise Moses would not
     have been so angry with Aaron’s sons for not eating of it) but a crucial
     part of the atonement.
        How does the eating of the sacrifice contribute to the process of
     atonement? Eating was required only of those offerings in which
     blood did not enter the Holy Place; that is, the offerings of the leader
     and the commoner. The Bible explicitly said that by eating the sac-
     rifice the priests would “bear away the guilt,” which would “make
     atonement” for the sinner. To carry the sinner’s guilt implies that the
     sinner now goes free.
        In the Hebrew, Exodus 34:7 says that God “carries iniquity,” the
     same two Hebrew words used in Leviticus 10:17, where it’s clear that
     the act of the priest’s carrying the sin is what brings forgiveness to
     the sinner. Otherwise, without that transfer, the sinner would have to
     bear his own sin (Lev. 5:1), and that, of course, would lead to death
     (Rom. 6:23).
        The priest’s work of bearing another’s sin is exactly what Christ did
     for us. He died in our place. We conclude, then, that the priestly work
     at the earthly sanctuary typifies Christ’s work for us, because He has
     taken upon Himself the guilt of our sins.
        “The blessing comes because of pardon; pardon comes through
     faith that the sin, confessed and repented of, is borne by the great
     Sin-bearer. Thus from Christ cometh all our blessings. His death is
     an atoning sacrifice for our sins. He is the great medium through
     whom we receive the mercy and favor of God. He, then, is indeed the
     Originator, the Author, as well as the Finisher, of our faith.”—Ellen
     G. White, Manuscript Releases, vol. 9, p. 302.

      Imagine standing before God in judgment. What would you
      lean on—your good works, your Sabbath keeping, all the nice
      things you have done and all the bad things you haven’t done?
      Do you really think this would be enough to justify you before
      a holy and perfect God? If not, what’s your only hope in that
      judgment?

     Forgiveness
Read Micah 7:18–20. What picture of God do we find in this pas-
     sage?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        The last three verses of the book of Micah focus on the relationship
     of God with His remnant. The text beautifully describes why God
     is unrivaled. He is incomparable because of His forgiving love and
     grace. The outstanding characteristic of God, as revealed in Micah
     (and elsewhere), is His willingness to forgive. Micah emphasizes
     this point by using various expressions for God’s attributes (vs. 18)
     and achievements (vss. 19, 20). His attributes and achievements are
     explained in the language of the Israelite Credo in Exodus 34:6, 7,
     one of the most beloved biblical descriptions of the character of God.
        Interestingly, several crucial words in Micah 7:18–20 are also used
     in the Servant Song in Isaiah 53, pointing to the fact that the means of
     forgiveness comes from the One who is suffering for the people.
        Unfortunately, not everyone will enjoy God’s saving grace. God’s
     forgiveness is neither cheap nor automatic. It involves loyalty. Those
     who have experienced His grace respond in kind, such as we see
     in Micah 6:8, a central text in the book. Just as God “delights in
     unchanging love” (NASB), He calls His remnant to “love kindness”
     (NASB). His people will imitate God’s character. Their lives will
     reflect His love, compassion, and kindness.
        In the Bible, Micah 7:18–20, with its emphasis on forgiveness, is
     immediately followed by Nahum 1:2, 3, with its emphasis on judg-
     ment. This unfolds the two dimensions of God’s dealings with us; He
     forgives the repentant and punishes the wicked. Both sides belong to
     God. He is Savior and Judge. These two aspects of God’s character
     are complementary, not contrary. A compassionate God can also be
     a just God. Knowing this, we can rest assured in His love, in His for-
     giveness, and in His ultimate justice.

      Read Micah 6:8. What good is a profession of faith without
      these principles to reveal the reality of that profession? What’s
      easier, to claim faith in Jesus or to live out that faith, as
      expressed in Micah 6:8? How can you better do the latter?

            “As Christ at His ascension appeared in the presence of God to
         plead His blood in behalf of penitent believers, so the priest in the

         in the sinner’s behalf.

         type the blood of the sin offering removed the sin from the penitent,
         but it rested in the sanctuary until the Day of Atonement.”—Ellen G.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Some have argued that the whole concept of substitution is
          unfair. Why should the innocent die in the place of the guilty?
          However, because this is a truth that is not only clearly taught
          in the Bible but is central to the core theme of the Bible, how do
          we answer that charge? Might the “unfairness” of it all help us
          to understand the grace that was displayed in order to bring us
3         forgiveness? That is, in what ways might this “unfairness” help
          to show just how great and merciful and loving our God really
          is?

          l
          2 As a class, read Micah 6:8. What are we being told here?
          More important, how can we learn to fufill this explicit com-
          mand? How do we learn to do all these things, including to “walk
          humbly with thy God”? What does that mean? How can walking
          humbly with God translate into walking humbly with others?

          l
          3 Think about what it means that the only way we could be
          saved was through the death of Jesus. What does this amazing
          truth teach us about just how bad sin is and why any effort to
          save ourselves by our own works is as fruitless as scrubbing a pig
          in hopes of making it kosher?

          l
          4 In class, go over the final question at the end of Wednesday’s
          lesson. Discuss your answers and the implications of your answers
          in terms of the gospel and that which God has done for us in
          order to save us.

The Sword and the Spirit
   Joseph’s heart pounded as the mob raged toward him. “Beat him!” some-
one yelled. “Kill him!” another echoed.
   Joseph hadn’t been a Christian long. In his zeal to share his new faith with
others, he had come to this village as a Global Mission pioneer to teach oth-
ers about Christ. Some listened, but others were angry that a Christian had
come to stir up their village. They found Joseph and demanded vengeance.
   Joseph prayed as the mob surrounded him. Then he spoke to the leader,
who brandished a sword. “Brother, I’ve come in peace and in the name of
Jesus,” he said. “My God wants to be your God too.”
   The crowd quieted, and the leader challenged Joseph with his eyes. “My
little girl has been paralyzed for six years. She can’t move, and she can’t
speak. If your God can heal my daughter, then we will leave you alone. But
if not, then we will kill you.” The man turned and walked toward his home.
The mob pushed Joseph to follow. Joseph and the mob leader entered the
house together.
   Joseph looked at Kamala, the little girl, and realized that only a miracle
would save her life—and his. He knelt by her bed and asked God to heal
Kamala if it was His will. “Help this family to understand that You are the
all-powerful God,” he prayed.
   Joseph finished his prayer and stood up. He continued to pray silently
for the child, and within minutes Kamala moved slightly. She stretched one
leg and then the other; then she stretched her arms. Slowly she sat up. The
family watched, speechless with joy, as Kamala pulled herself up on her
once-withered legs and took a step.
   “My daughter!” Kamala’s mother whispered. The girl smiled and walked
slowly toward her mother. Tearfully the man who had planned to kill Joseph
hugged him. “I want to know about your God,” he said.
   News of the girl’s miraculous healing spread rapidly through the village.
Many wanted to know about Joseph’s God. The man who had brandished
                             a sword and planned to kill Joseph now works
                             with him to teach others about the living God.
                             Dozens have turned to Jesus and worship Him
                             instead of their former gods.
                                Our mission offerings help support the work
                             of men and women such as Joseph who serve
                             as Global Mission pioneers around the world.
                             Thank you for having a part in the work of God

      The Day of Atonement




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Leviticus 16, Lev. 23:27–32,
      Deut. 19:16–21, Matt. 18:23–35, Isa. 6:1–6.

Memory Text: “Who is a God like Thee, who pardons iniquity
      and passes over the rebellious act of the remnant of His posses-
      sion? He does not retain His anger forever, because He delights
      in unchanging love. He will again have compassion on us; He will
      tread our iniquities underfoot. Yes, Thou wilt cast all their sins into
      the depths of the sea” (Micah 7:18, 19, NASB).



      T
             he Day of Atonement, or Yom Kippur, as revealed in Leviticus
             16, is the most solemn Old Testament ritual. It is deliberately
             placed in the heart of the book of Leviticus, which is itself at
      the center of the Five Books of Moses, in order to help to illustrate the
      “most holy” character of this ritual. Also referred to as the Sabbath
      of Sabbaths (Lev. 16:31), the day calls for the cessation of all work,
      which is unique for an Israelite yearly festival. This fact places the
      day squarely within the concept of the Sabbath—it is a time to rest in
      what God, as Creator and Redeemer, has done (and will do) for us.
        This week we will study what happened on the Day of Atonement
      in the earthly sanctuary, specifically the rituals with the two goats,
      which helps us to better understand deeper truths regarding salvation
      and the final disposition of sin.

     The Yearly Cleansing
Read Leviticus 16:16, 30. What is purged on the Day of Atonement?
      ________________________________________________________

        Throughout the year, all kinds of sins and ritual impurities were
     transferred to the sanctuary. With the Day of Atonement comes
     the time for their removal. There are three main parts to the Day of
     Atonement:
        1. The purification offering for the priest. The high priest slaughtered
     a bull for his sins, making sure that he (the priest) would be clean when
     entering the sanctuary so that he could perform the ritual to cleanse it.
        2. The purification offering of the goat “for the Lord” (Lev. 16:8,
     NKJV). During the year, the purification offerings “brought” all the
     sins of the Israelites into the sanctuary. The Day of Atonement was
     the time to remove these sins from the sanctuary; this process was
     done through the blood of the goat “for the Lord.”
        3. The elimination ritual with the live goat for Azazel. God wanted
     to get the sins of His people away from the sanctuary and the camp.
     Therefore, another live goat was sent out into the desert.

Read Leviticus 16:15. What happened to this goat, and what did it
     symbolize?

      ________________________________________________________

       Because there was neither confession of sin nor laying on of hands
     involved with the goat for the Lord, its blood was not a carrier of sin.
     Thus, it did not defile; but rather, it cleansed. The effect is clearly
     described in verses 16 and 20. The high priest made atonement with
     the blood of the Lord’s goat, cleansing the entire sanctuary. The same
     procedure also effected the purification of the people so that, when
     the sanctuary was cleansed from all the people’s sins, the people
     themselves were cleansed too. In this sense the Day of Atonement
     was unique, for only on this day were both the sanctuary and the
     people cleansed.
       The Day of Atonement was the second stage of a two-phase atone-
     ment. In the first phase, during the year, the Israelites were forgiven.
     Their sins were not blotted out but were entrusted to God Himself, who
     promised to deal with them. The second phase did not have much to
     do with forgiveness; the people were already forgiven. In fact, the verb
     forgive does not occur at all in Leviticus 16 or in Leviticus 23:27–32.
     What this shows us is that the entire plan of salvation deals with more
     than just the forgiveness of our sins, a point that makes even more sense
     when understood in the wider context of the great controversy.
                                                                            47

     Beyond Forgiveness
Read Leviticus 16:32–34. What was the main task of the high priest
     on the Day of Atonement?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        The primary function of the high priest was to mediate between
     God and humankind. Regarding the sanctuary, he administered the
     system and performed various rituals of sacrifices and offerings (Heb.
     8:3). His task on the Day of Atonement was enormous. He performed
     almost every ritual, except for leading the goat for Azazel into the
     wilderness, though he gave the command to send the goat away.
        On the Day of Atonement, the “great” priest, as he was also called,
     became a living example of Christ. Just as the attention of God’s
     people was focused on the high priest, Jesus is the exclusive center
     of our attention. As the activities of the high priest on earth brought
     cleansing to the people, Jesus’ work in the heavenly sanctuary does
     the same for us (Rom. 8:34, 1 John 1:9). Just as the only hope of the
     people on the Day of Atonement was in the high priest, our only hope
     is in Christ.
        “The blood of Christ, while it was to release the repentant sinner
     from the condemnation of the law, was not to cancel the sin; it would
     stand on record in the sanctuary until the final atonement; so in the
     type the blood of the sin offering removed the sin from the penitent,
     but it rested in the sanctuary until the Day of Atonement.”—Ellen G.
     White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 357.
        According to Leviticus 16:16–20, the high priest had to enter the
     Most Holy Place and purge it from the ritual impurities, transgressions,
     and sins. He then transferred all the iniquities, all the transgressions,
     and all the sins of Israel onto the live goat and sent them away, through
     the goat, into the desert. Thus, all the moral faults of Israel were gone.
     This achieved the unique goal of the Day of Atonement: a moral puri-
     fication that went beyond forgiveness. There was no new forgiveness
     necessary on this day. God had already forgiven their sins.

      As we struggle with all our God-given strength to put away all
      sin, how can we learn to lean totally on Christ’s merits as our
      only hope of salvation?

     Azazel
Read Leviticus 16:20–22. What happened to the live goat?
      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        The ritual with the live goat was not an offering. After the lot
     decided which of the two goats was to be for Yahweh and which
     one was for Azazel (often translated as “scapegoat”), only the goat
     for Yahweh is referred to as a purification offering (vss. 9, 15). By
     contrast, the goat for Azazel is called the “live goat.” It was never
     slain, probably to avoid any idea that the ritual constituted a sacrifice.
     The live goat came into play only after the high priest had finished
     the atonement of the entire sanctuary (vs. 20). This point cannot be
     overemphasized: the ensuing ritual with the live goat had nothing to
     do with the actual cleansing of the sanctuary or of the people. They
     already had been cleansed.
        Who or what is Azazel? Early Jewish interpreters identified Azazel
     as the original angelic sinner and the primary author of evil, even as
     the leader of evil angels. We know him, of course, as a symbol of
     Lucifer himself.
        The ritual with the live goat was a rite of elimination that accom-
     plished the final disposal of sin. Sin would be brought upon the one
     responsible for it in the first place and then carried away from the
     people forever. “Atonement” was made upon it in a punitive sense
     (Lev. 16:10), as the goat carried the ultimate responsibility for sin.
        Does Satan then play a role in our salvation, as some falsely charge
     we teach? Of course not. Satan never, in any way, bears sin for us as a
     substitute. Jesus alone has done that, and it is blasphemy to think that
     Satan had any part in our redemption.
        The ritual with the live goat finds a parallel in the law of the mali-
     cious witness (Deut. 19:16–21). The accuser and the accused stand
     before the Lord, represented by the priests and judges. An investiga-
     tion is held; and, if the accuser is found to be a malicious witness,
     he shall receive the punishment he intended for the innocent (for
     example, vicious Haman who put up gallows for loyal Mordecai).

      Thank God again for His merciful forgiveness and the fact that
      He will remember our sin no more (Jer. 31:34). How can we
      learn not to remember our sins once they are forgiven? Why is
      it so important for us to do this?

     On the Day of Atonement
        “Thus in the ministration of the tabernacle, and of the temple
     that afterward took its place, the people were taught each day the
     great truths relative to Christ’s death and ministration, and once
     each year their minds were carried forward to the closing events
     of the great controversy between Christ and Satan, the final puri-
     fication of the universe from sin and sinners.”—Ellen G. White,
     Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 358.

Read Leviticus 16:29–31 and 23:27–32. What did God expect the
     Israelites to do on Yom Kippur? How do these principles
     apply to us today, living as we are in the “antitypical Day of
     Atonement”?

        If someone in ancient Israel did not follow these instructions, he was
     to be cut off and destroyed (Lev. 23:29, 30). The Day of Atonement
     was truly about nothing less than life and death. It demanded the
     believer’s complete loyalty to God.
        Imagine that someone had confessed his sins during the first phase
     of atonement during the year; that is, the daily sacrifices, but then did
     not take the Day of Atonement seriously. By his disregard of what
     God had planned to demonstrate on this day, such a person proved
     himself to be disloyal to God.
        What this means is that a person who professes faith in God can
     still lose salvation. As Seventh-day Adventists, we do not believe in
     once-saved-always-saved, because the Bible does not teach it. We are
     secure in Christ just as long as we live in faith and surrender to Him,
     claiming His power for victory when tempted and His forgiveness
     when we fall.

      Read Matthew 18:23–35. What lesson should we take away
      from this powerful parable?

     Isaiah’s Personal Yom Kippur
       In Isaiah 6:1, Isaiah sees the heavenly King sitting on a throne in
     the temple, “high and exalted.” The vision is a judgment scene that
     presents God as coming for judgment (Isa. 5:16). Isaiah beholds
     the true King, identified in the Gospel of John as Jesus Christ (John
     12:41).
       Even though Isaiah was God’s prophet and he called others to
     repentance, he understood that in God’s presence he was doomed.
     Confronted with God’s holiness and glory, Isaiah perceived his own
     sinfulness and also the uncleanness of his people. Holiness and sin are
     incompatible. Like Isaiah, we all need to come to the conclusion that
     we cannot pass through the divine judgment on our own. Our only
     hope is to have a Substitute.

What parallels to the Day of Atonement appear in Isaiah 6:1–6?
      ________________________________________________________

        The combination of a temple filled with smoke, an altar, judg-
     ment, and atonement for sin and uncleanness recalls strongly the
     Day of Atonement. Isaiah experienced his own “personal Day of
     Atonement,” as it were.
        Functioning like a priest, a seraph (literally “burning one”) took a
     burning coal from the altar, presupposing some kind of offering, to
     purge the prophet’s sin. This is an apt image for the cleansing from sin
     that is possible through the sacrifice of Jesus and His priestly ministry
     of mediation. Isaiah recognized this as a cleansing ritual, and he kept
     still as the coal touched his lips. Thereby his “iniquity is taken away”
     and his “sin is forgiven” (Isa. 6:7, NASB). The passive voice in verse
     7 shows that forgiveness is granted by the One sitting on the throne.
     The Judge is also the Savior.
        God’s work of cleansing brings us from “Woe is me” to “Here am
     I, send me.” In other words, understanding the heavenly work on
     the Day of Atonement leads to a readiness for proclamation because
     a true understanding leads to assurance and surety. This is because
     we know that in judgment we have a Substitute, Jesus Christ, whose
     righteousness alone (symbolized by the blood) will enable us to stand
     without fear of condemnation (Rom. 8:1). Gratitude motivates mis-
     sion. Acquitted sinners are God’s best ambassadors (2 Cor. 5:18–20)
     because they know what God has delivered them from.
                                                                          51

    Further Study: “Now the event takes place foreshadowed in the
         last solemn service of the Day of Atonement. When the ministration
         in the holy of holies had been completed, and the sins of Israel had
         been removed from the sanctuary by virtue of the blood of the sin
         offering, then the scapegoat was presented alive before the Lord; and
1
         in the presence of the congregation the high priest confessed over him
         ‘all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their transgressions
         in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat.’ Leviticus
         16:21. In like manner, when the work of atonement in the heavenly
         sanctuary has been completed, then in the presence of God and heav-
         enly angels and the hosts of the redeemed the sins of God’s people
2        will be placed upon Satan; he will be declared guilty of all the evil
         which he has caused them to commit.”—Ellen G. White, The Great
         Controversy, pp. 657, 658.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Why would any understanding of the plan of salvation be
          incomplete if it leaves out or minimizes the work of Christ as our
          High Priest? What does the sanctuary teach us about just how
3         central the work of intercession in the sanctuary is to the plan of
          salvation? The bulk of an entire New Testament book, Hebrews,
          is dedicated to the work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary. In
          view of this, just how important is that work?

          l
          2 Someone once wrote that the work of Christ, from His death
          to His ministry in the heavenly sanctuary, is simply part of
          “God’s orderly method” of dealing with the sin problem in a
          way that will help to answer all questions regarding His justice,
          fairness, and love. Dwell on the implications of that thought,
          especially in light of the great controversy and what it teaches us
          about the grand issues involved in the sordid tragedy of sin.

          l
          3 Many Seventh-day Adventists were taught about the Day of
          Atonement in a way that has left them without assurance of sal-
          vation. Such a view comes from a false understanding of the pur-
          pose of the Day of Atonement. Think about the word atonement.
          What does it mean? How is atonement achieved? Who does the
          work of atonement? How is it accomplished? How should these
          answers help us to understand why the Day of Atonement is
          actually good news?

A Child Shall Lead
   From infancy, Joelito’s mother taught him to love and serve Jesus. When
she led small-group meetings, Joelito watched her and learned from her.
When he was eight years old, he asked to be baptized and to lead others to
Jesus.
   When Joelito was ten, the government of Peru passed a law requiring
children to attend school on Sabbath. His teacher allowed him to skip
classes and make up work on Mondays. But when the time came for
national exams, the teacher couldn’t help him. “If you don’t take the exam,”
she said sadly, “you’ll fail.” Joelito prayed that God would intervene, and in
faith he spent the Sabbath worshiping God.
   On Monday Joelito learned that the exam hadn’t been given on Saturday
because the classroom key had been lost. Joel thanked God for making it
possible for him to keep the Sabbath and still take the exam.
   Joelito told his friends how God had answered his prayers. He invited
them to church and offered to study the Bible with them, just as he had
learned from his mother. When the church held children’s programs, Joelito
invited his friends to attend. If they couldn’t attend, he offered to visit their
homes and study the children’s Bible course with them. The mother of one
of the children asked Joelito to study the Bible with her. “I wasn’t nervous,”
Joelito says. “I had watched my mother give many Bible studies.”
   Joelito’s church is small, and everyone takes part. When Joelito was 12,
he began taking turns preaching and working as the stewardship leader.
   During the summer vacation, young people throughout the country take
part in a program called Mission Caleb. They go to a specific town to
do community service, visit door to door, and give Bible studies. Joelito
wanted to go, but he was told that he was too young. So, he stayed home
and helped a group of Mission Caleb volunteers that had come to his town
to do similar work.
                                 Joelito continues to work hand in hand with
                              God, visiting people, giving them Bible studies,
                              and working in the church. “I don’t go with my
                              mom to give Bible studies anymore,” he says.
                              “I’m too busy giving my own Bible studies.”
                              Joelito preaches in his church once a month,
                              and he loves it.
                                 Part of your Thirteenth Sabbath Offering
                              recently helped to build a small church in
                              Joelito’s town. Thank you for sharing so that
                              others can hear God’s message of love.

      Christ, Our Sacrifice

Read for This Week’s Study: Isa. 53:2–12, Heb. 2:9, Heb.
      9:26–28, Heb. 9:12, Exod. 12:5, Heb. 4:15.

Memory Text: “He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross,

      wounds you were healed” (1 Peter 2:24, NASB).

              atholic Priest Maximilian Kolbe was imprisoned in Auschwitz
              for providing shelter to refugees from Greater Poland, includ-
              ing 2,000 Jews. When a prisoner in his barracks vanished
      (perhaps he escaped), the SS picked ten prisoners to be starved to
      death in reprisal. One of the selected men cried out, “Oh, my poor
      wife, my poor children. I shall never see them again.” At that point
      Kolbe offered himself in the man’s place; that is, he asked that he be
      the one to starve, not the distraught family man. The surprised SS
      officer agreed, and Kolbe joined the ranks of the doomed while the
      other man survived.
         However moving, Kolbe’s sacrifice is only a shadow of the One
      who willingly took our place, an act symbolized in the sanctuary ser-
      vice. The New Testament identifies Jesus with the two major aspects
      of the Old Testament sacrificial system: He is our Sacrifice (Hebrews
      9, 10), and He is our High Priest (Hebrews 5–10).
         This week we will study different aspects of Christ’s ultimate sacri-
      fice and see what His once-and-for-all death has provided for us.

     Jesus in Isaiah 53
Read Isaiah 53:2–12. What do these verses teach about what Christ
     did for us?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Isaiah 52:13–53:12 is a powerful description of Christ’s death for
     the sins of the world. Several aspects in this passage provide clear evi-
     dence that Jesus’ death is atonement in the form of penal substitution,
     which means that He took the penalty that others deserved and, in
     fact, died as a Substitute for them. Here are some of the implications
     of this passage for Jesus’ ministry for us:
        1. Jesus suffered for others. He took their grief and sorrows (vs. 4),
     transgressions, iniquities (vss. 5, 6, 8, 11), and sin (vs. 12).
        2. He brings great benefits to those for whom He suffers: peace and
     healing (vs. 5) and justification (vs. 11).
        3. It was God’s will for Jesus to suffer and be crushed (vs. 10). God
     put our iniquity on Him (vs. 6) because it was God’s plan that He died
     in our stead.
        4. Jesus is righteous (vs. 11), without violence or deceit (vs. 9).
        5. He was a guilt offering, an atoning sacrifice for sin (vs. 10).

Read Luke 22:37, Acts 8:32–35, and 1 Peter 2:21–25. How do these
     New Testament authors interpret Isaiah 53?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

       The New Testament allusions to Isaiah 53 establish beyond doubt
     that Jesus Christ fulfills this prophecy. Even He identified Himself
     with the person depicted there (Luke 22:37). Christ took our sins upon
     Himself so that we could be forgiven and transformed.

      Dwell on all that Isaiah 53 says that Christ did for us. How can
      you make this personal, and know that no matter what you
      have done, the assurances here can apply to you if you give
      yourself to the Lord in faith and surrender?

     Sufficient Substitution
Read Hebrews 2:9. What does it mean that Jesus “taste[d] death for
     everyone”? See also Heb. 2:17, 9:26–28, 10:12.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Jesus died for sinners. He was without sin (Heb. 4:15) so that when
     He gave His life as a sacrifice He would not die for His own sin. On
     the contrary, He was “to bear the sins of many” (Heb. 9:28, NKJV),
     to “make propitiation for the sins of the people” (Heb. 2:17, NKJV),
     and to put away sin forever (Heb. 9:26).
        According to Hebrews 2:9, the purpose of making Jesus “lower than
     the angels” is so that He could suffer death. The point is to explain
     why Jesus’ death is an indispensable requirement for His exaltation.
     In simple terms, in order for humanity to be saved, Jesus had to die.
     There was no other way.
        In this passage, the goal of the Incarnation is the death of the Son.
     Only through the suffering of death could Jesus become the Author
     of salvation (Heb. 2:10).
        Why was it fitting for God to let Jesus suffer? The context in
     Hebrews 2:14–18 suggests that Jesus’ death was necessary in order to
     rescue God’s children from the slavery of death, from the devil, and
     from the fear of death, and to qualify Jesus to become a “merciful and
     faithful High Priest” (NKJV).
        In short, the Cross had to precede the crown.
        “Upon Christ as our substitute and surety was laid the iniquity of us
     all. He was counted a transgressor, that He might redeem us from the
     condemnation of the law. The guilt of every descendant of Adam was
     pressing upon His heart. The wrath of God against sin, the terrible mani-
     festation of His displeasure because of iniquity, filled the soul of His Son
     with consternation.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 753.

      Christ, the Creator of the universe, died as a human being for
      your sins. Dwell on what this means. Think of the incredible
      good news that it is. Think of the hope it offers you, personally.
      How can you make this amazing truth the chief motivation of
      all that you do?

     Christ’s Blood
        The concept of redemptive blood pervades the entire Bible.
     Starting from the earliest sacrifices after Adam and Eve sinned,
     blood was always present when animal sacrifices occurred. Blood
     rituals characterized the Israelite sacrificial system in order to illus-
     trate the crucial truth that, without blood, we would not have any
     chance to be forgiven our sins and to enter into the presence of God.
     Blood was the only way to receive God’s mercy and to have com-
     munity with Him.

Read the following passages in Hebrews about Christ’s blood and
     the blood of the Old Testament sacrifices. What do they teach us
     about the blood?

     Heb. 9:12 ________________________________________________

     Heb. 9:14 ________________________________________________

     Heb. 9:18 ________________________________________________

     Heb. 9:22 ________________________________________________

     Heb. 10:19 _______________________________________________

     Heb. 12:24 _______________________________________________

     Heb. 13:12 _______________________________________________

     Heb. 13:20 _______________________________________________

        Christ’s blood does not refer to His life, but instead it is a symbol
     of His substitutionary death. As such, it describes the functional
     aspect of that death. Christ’s shed blood is amazingly multifunctional.
     Christ’s blood obtains eternal redemption for us, provides us with
     cleansing from sin, provides us with forgiveness and sanctification,
     and is the reason for the resurrection.
        In Hebrews, there is a powerful contrast: Christ’s blood is bet-
     ter than any other blood. In fact, no other blood can really provide
     forgiveness; Christ’s death is the only reason why sins are forgiven,
     before and after the Cross (Heb. 9:15). The shedding of Christ’s
     blood, and its effects, are clear evidence that Christ’s death was
     substitionary, which means that He took the penalty that we deserve.

      How should an understanding of Christ’s death help to free us
      from any notion that our own works can save us?
                                                                          59

      Spotless Sacrifice
Which criteria does a sacrificial animal need to meet? Read Exod.
      12:5, Lev. 3:1, 4:3.

      ________________________________________________________

         The selection of a sacrificial animal required great care. A person
      could not just take any animal for an offering; the animal needed to
      fulfill several criteria, depending on the kind of offering.
         However, there is one criterion that all offerings had to meet. They
      had to be “unblemished.” The Hebrew word tamim could also be
      translated as “complete,” “unscathed,” “without fault,” or “perfect.” It
      expresses the idea that something meets the highest standard possible.
      Only the best was good enough.
         Pertaining to people, the word is used to characterize their relation-
      ship with God as being “blameless” (Gen. 6:9, 17:1, NASB).

How do these texts describe Jesus? Heb. 4:15; 7:26; 9:14; and 1 Pet.
      1:18, 19. Why was it crucial that Jesus be sinless?

      ________________________________________________________

        Jesus, the “Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world”
      (John 1:29, NKJV), perfectly fulfills the Old Testament criterion
      of a spotless sacrifice. His pure life established Jesus as a perfect
      sacrifice. This is the guarantee of our salvation, for only a sinless
      one could bear our sin for us, and it is His perfect righteousness that
      covers us, now and in the judgment. That righteousness is our hope
      of salvation.
        Like its Hebrew equivalent, the Greek word for “without blemish”
      (amomos) is used not only to describe Jesus and His flawless sacrifice
      but also the character of His followers.
        “By comparing their lives with Christ’s character, they will be able
      to discern where they have failed to meet the requirements of God’s
      holy law; and will seek to make themselves perfect in their sphere
      even as God is perfect in his sphere.”—Ellen G. White, The Paulson
      Letters, p. 374.
        Through Christ’s death and His ministry, we are presented blame-
      less before God (Jude 24). This is possible only because the Blameless
      One stands in our place.

       Why can the concept of being “holy and blameless” cause
       uneasiness? How can the knowledge that Christ is our Substitute
       help you to accept that you are “holy,” as well? How should our
       new status before God impact the way in which we live?

     A Great Danger
       In the book of Hebrews, Paul not only focuses on the theological
     understanding of Christ’s sacrifice, but he also explains some of its
     practical implications. At several places he shows what happens if
     someone ignores this sacrifice.

Read Hebrews 6:4–6 and 10:26–31. About what is Paul warning us?
     What kinds of attitudes does he describe?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        In the book of Hebrews, Paul demonstrates how magnificent
     God’s salvation is, how God has revealed Himself, and what He has
     done and is doing for the believers. However, there is at least one
     main, problematic issue that Paul has to address. It is the danger that
     Christ’s sacrifice could gradually be taken for granted. He describes
     such a danger as “drifting away” from the goal (Heb. 2:1). The imag-
     ery behind Paul’s words is that of a ship that is veering off course and
     does not reach the port of destination. So, the main task is to stay on
     course.
        Some of those who reject God do so deliberately, which means that
     their lives after receiving the gospel are virtually the same as they
     were before these people received the gospel. These people do not, in
     fact, have any efficacious sacrifice for their sins (Heb. 10:26–31). It
     seems that not many believers would forthrightly reject Christ’s sacri-
     fice or even think about such a thing. Still, Paul sounds a warning. The
     real danger of disregard and neglect is that it is often a subtle and very
     gradual process. The transition can be unnoticeable. Gradually, the
     work of Christ is not appreciated enough, similar to Esau’s failure to
     appreciate his birthright anymore (Heb. 12:15–17). Christ’s sacrifice
     should never become so familiar that we regard it as commonplace.
        Paul does not want to make his readers fearful; nevertheless, he
     needs to show them the consequences of veering away from God.
     He does not want such a thing to happen. On the positive side, he
     encourages them vividly to “hold fast” to all the good things of salva-
     tion (Heb. 3:6, 14; 10:23) and to fix their eyes on Jesus (Heb. 12:2).

      What about yourself? Have you simply become “used to” the
      amazing truth about the Cross? Why is this such a terrible
      thing to do? How can we protect ourselves from the danger that
      Paul warns about here?
                                                                           61

    Further Study: “The Atonement, Part I—Atoning Sacrifice,”
         pp. 457–476, in Appendix C of The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7A.

            What Martin Luther frequently called a “wonderful exchange” or
         “joyous exchange” of Christ’s righteousness for human sin, Ellen G.
         White describes in a classic statement as follows: “Christ was treated
         as we deserve, that we might be treated as He deserves. He was
         condemned for our sins, in which He had no share, that we might be
         justified by His righteousness, in which we had no share. He suffered
1        the death which was ours, that we might receive the life which was
         His. ‘With His stripes we are healed.’ ”—The Desire of Ages, p. 25.
            “Nothing less than the death of Christ could make His love effica-
         cious for us. It is only because of His death that we can look with joy
         to His second coming. His sacrifice is the center of our hope. Upon
         this we must fix our faith.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages,
2        p. 660.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Some don’t like the idea of Jesus as our Sacrifice. They think
          it makes God sound bloodthirsty or vengeful, like the pagan dei-
          ties of the past. (In fact, some argue that the language of blood
          and sacrifice and so forth in the Bible is simply a reflection of
3
          these pagan concepts.) What is so dramatically wrong with this
          perception of the Cross? How do the concepts of death, sacrifice,
          and blood help to show us just how serious sin and its conse-
          quences are? How should this realization of the cost of sin help
          us to seek God’s power to put sin out of our lives?

          l
          2 Some people struggle with the issue of works and how they
          relate to salvation. How can keeping before us Christ’s sub-
          stitutionary death, and what He accomplished for us by that
          death, help to protect us from falling into the trap of salvation
          by works? After all, what could our works possibly add to what
          Christ has done for us by dying in our stead?

          l
          3 Ellen G. White said it would be good to spend a thoughtful
          hour every day focusing on the life of Jesus, especially the clos-
          ing scenes. How could such an exercise help to strengthen our
          relationship with Christ, as well as increase our appreciation of
          what He has done for us?

God of the Impossible
   When my parents died, my grandmother took me in. Her priest hoped I
would follow in his footsteps, so he paid my school fees. One day he gave
me a sermon and told me to preach it the following Sunday. I didn’t under-
stand it, and the priest wasn’t there to explain it. So, I asked a Seventh-day
Adventist neighbor to explain it to me. He read the sermon and said the
sermon wasn’t biblical. Then he read several Bible texts that explained
what the Bible actually said.
   I skipped church that Sunday. Angry, the priest threatened to stop pay-
ing my school fees. I told the Seventh-day Adventist man, and he read me
two powerful Bible texts. “For what will it profit a man if he gains the
whole world, and loses his own soul?” (Mark 8:36, NKJV), and “Seek first
the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be
added to you” (Matt. 6:33, NKJV). He invited me to visit his church. On
Sabbath I found a few Seventh-day Adventists worshiping under a tree.
But I sensed that God was there.
   The priest stopped paying my school fees, and I had to quit school. My
neighbors taunted me for rebelling. But the Seventh-day Adventist district
pastor found a sponsor so I could study. In time I was baptized into the
Seventh-day Adventist Church.
   When my sponsor died, I had no means to continue studying. I prepared
to go home, but the school’s accountant stopped me and said my fees
were paid for two more terms. I praised God and continued my studies. I
worked to pay my remaining fees until I graduated.
   I wanted to study at Zambia Adventist University, but with no sponsor,
I couldn’t enroll. I prayed fervently for God’s help. I was offered a job
on campus that would pay my tuition. I stayed with four other students in
an unused chicken house until the school helped us find something better.
We didn’t mind, for we are studying!
                                I’m studying to serve God as a pastor. That’s
                             not exactly what the priest had in mind when
                             he sent me to school, but I know it’s God’s
                             will. I love to tell others this wonderful truth
                             that I have learned. People in my village have
                             seen that my God is the God of the impossible.
                             Four members of my family have surrendered
                             their lives to God and joined the Seventh-day

         Lesson            8       *November 16–22



      Christ, Our Priest




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Ps. 110:1–5; Gen. 14:18–20;
      Heb. 7:1–3; Rom. 8:31–34; 1 Tim. 2:4–6; Heb. 8:6; Heb. 2:17, 18;
      Heb. 3:6; Heb. 10:1–14.

Memory Text: “Now the main point in what has been said is
      this: we have such a high priest, who has taken His seat at the
      right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, a minis-
      ter in the sanctuary and in the true tabernacle, which the Lord
      pitched, not man” (Hebrews 8:1, 2, NASB).



      A
               fter His resurrection and ascension to the heavenly sanctuary,
               Christ entered into a new phase of the plan of Redemption
               (Heb. 2:17). With the indispensable requirement of His sac-
      rifice fulfilled, He was inaugurated as Priest and began His priestly
      ministry in order to mediate His perfect sacrifice in behalf of those
      covered, by faith, by His blood. His priestly ministry consists of two
      phases, both foreshadowed in the earthly sanctuary: the daily ministry
      and the yearly ministry during the Day of Atonement.
         This week we will study the work of Jesus during His daily ministry
      and see some of the practical ramifications that His work has for us.
      We can, indeed, draw great comfort from knowing that Jesus is now
      standing in the presence of God, ministering the merits of His sacri-
      fice in our behalf. The sanctuary message offers hope and encourage-
      ment to even the weakest of His followers.

     Our High Priest
       The New Testament book that speaks the most about Christ as
     Priest is Hebrews. The Old Testament backbone of Hebrews consists
     of two verses quoted from Psalm 110. Verse 1 is cited to confirm
     that Christ is exalted above all because He sat down at the right hand
     of God. This is a recurring theme in Hebrews, one that emphasizes
     Jesus’ divinity and Messiahship (Heb. 1:3, 4:14, 7:26, 8:1, 12:2).
     Psalm 110:4 is used to demonstrate that Christ’s priesthood has been
     foreshadowed by Melchizedek (Heb. 5:6).

In what ways does Christ fulfill the divinely promised priesthood
     according to the order of Melchizedek? Compare Gen. 14:18–20,
     Ps. 110:4, and Heb. 7:1–3.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        The Bible does not provide much information regarding
     Melchizedek. Yet, what it does reveal shows remarkable similarities
     to Jesus. Melchizedek is the king of the city Salem (Salem means
     “peace,” so he is the “King of Peace”). His name means “King of
     Righteousness,” which speaks of his character. He is detached from
     history, as his familial line is not given. His birth and death are not
     mentioned. So, it seems as if he had no beginning and no end, and
     he is “priest of the Most High God.” Melchizedek’s priesthood is
     superior to the Levitical priesthood, because through Abraham, Levi
     gave tithes to Melchizedek (Heb. 7:4–10). Melchizedek, then, is a
     type of Christ.
        But Christ is even more. Aaron was the first high priest in Israel.
     Hebrews 5:1–4 describes an idealized Aaronic high priestly office:
     divine appointment, representative of men, mediation before God,
     compassionate, and offering sacrifices for the people and for him-
     self.
        The book of Hebrews portrays Christ as the new High Priest. He
     is of a better order than even Aaron; not only does He fulfill the
     requirements of the Aaronite priesthood, He enhances them. Jesus
     had no sin, was fully obedient, and did not need to bring an offering
     for Himself. On the contrary, He Himself was the offering­—the most
     perfect offering possible.
        Jesus fulfilled both the Aaronite and the Melchizedek high priest-
     hood in a better way than either of those priests, or priesthoods, ever
     did or could. Both types met their antitype in Christ.
                                                                        65

     Advocate and Intercessor
Read Romans 8:31–34. What great hope and promise is offered us
     here?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

       The background of verses 31–34 is a courtroom scene in which
     we should visualize ourselves on trial. Questions are asked: Who is
     against us? Who will bring a charge against us? Who condemns us?
     Such a situation could easily send shivers down our spines. After all,
     are we not well aware of our human imperfection and sinfulness?
       However, we do not need to fear. The promise that nothing and
     no one can separate us from God’s love centers on several impor-
     tant points: God is for us (vs. 31), God delivered His Son for us
     (vs. 32), God freely gives us all things (vs. 32), and God justifies us
     (vs. 33). Jesus Christ is on our side. Jesus is the answer to any fear
     of condemnation, for He died, was raised, and is now continuously
     interceding for us in the heavenly sanctuary at the right hand of God
     (vs. 34).
       If someone goes so far as to die willingly for us, we should feel
     confident of His love. The assurance revealed in Romans 8:31–39 is
     really telling us about the kind of God we believe in. If we understand
     that our God loves us so much that nothing can thwart His purposes
     for us (vss. 35–39), the divine courtroom becomes a place of joy and
     jubilation.
       This truth becomes even clearer in 1 John 2:1, 2. The Greek
     parakletos designates a legal assistant or advocate, someone who
     appears in another’s behalf as “intercessor.” Jesus is our Advocate,
     and He defends us because otherwise we would have no hope.
       Our Advocate is “righteous,” which gives us the assurance that the
     Father will hear Christ’s intercession, for Christ could do nothing that
     His righteous Father would reject. Christ intercedes for those who
     have sinned, presenting Himself—the One who has not sinned—as
     the Righteous One who stands in their stead.

      How can you better experience the marvelous truth that noth-
      ing will separate you from God’s love? How can you use this
      assurance as a motivation to live as God would have you live, as
      opposed, perhaps, to how you are living now?

Mediator
  “Who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge
of the truth. For there is one God and one Mediator between God
and men, the Man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself a ransom for
all, to be testified in due time” (1 Tim. 2:4–6, NKJV). How do these
verses help us to understand just what Christ is doing for us in
heaven?

________________________________________________________

________________________________________________________

________________________________________________________

   Christ is called the one Mediator between God and man. There is no
one else because, in fact, no one else is necessary. Through Christ’s
position as Mediator, salvation and knowledge of truth are universally
available (1 Tim. 2:4). The crucial question for us all is whether or
not we will take advantage of what Christ has offered to each of us,
regardless of our status, race, character, or past deeds.
   Mediator is a term from the ancient Greek commercial and legal
world. It describes someone who negotiates or acts as arbitrator
between two parties in order to remove a disagreement or to reach a
common goal in order to inaugurate a contract or covenant.
   In Hebrews, Christ as Mediator is connected to the new covenant
(Heb. 8:6, 9:15, 12:24). He has made reconciliation. Though sin
had destroyed the close communion between humanity and God and
would have led to the destruction of the race, Christ came and restored
the connection. This is reconciliation. He alone is the link between
God and humanity, and through this link we can enjoy a full covenant
relationship with the Lord.
   Paul’s reference to Him as the “man Christ Jesus” expresses His
unique quality of being both human and divine (1 Tim. 2:5). Salvation
and mediation are anchored precisely in Jesus’ humanity and His vol-
untary self-offering. By being both God and human, Jesus is able to
link heaven and earth with ties that can never be broken.
   “Jesus Christ came that He might link finite man with the infinite
God, and connect earth that has been divorced by sin and transgres-
sion from heaven.”—Ellen G. White, Sermons and Talks, vol. 1,
p. 253.

 Think: there is a human being in heaven right now, mediating
 in your behalf. What should this tell you about your importance
 in the eyes of God? How should this truth influence how you
 live and how you treat others?
                                                                   67

     Great High Priest
What do the following texts reveal about Christ’s ministry as High
     Priest? Heb. 2:17, 18; 3:6; 4:14, 15; 7:24–28; 8:1–3.

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________

        Jesus is the “great High Priest” (Heb. 4:14, NKJV). He is supe-
     rior to all high priests and rulers of earth. Jesus is the true and only
     High Priest. The Bible assigns a number of qualities to Jesus as
     great High Priest:
        Merciful and faithful. The two characteristics of merciful and
     faithful (Heb. 2:17) fit Christ’s role as Mediator, for He bestows
     His gifts on us (is “merciful”) and is loyal to His Father and to us
     (is “faithful”).
         With us. Jesus can sympathize with us (Heb. 2:18; 5:2, 7).
     Because He has lived as a human, we can trust that He is a compas-
     sionate and perfect Helper. Yet, He is not in the same situation as
     we are, because He is “without sin” (Heb. 4:15).
        Over us. Jesus as High Priest is not in the community of believ-
     ers as Moses was; He is over us, like a son presides over the house
     of his father (Heb. 3:6). Christ enjoys full authority among the
     saints.
        As we are. Jesus’ divine origin did not give Him any exclusive
     rights. He was tempted just as we are (Heb. 4:15). The selected
     temptations in the Judean desert show that He was tempted in the
     physical, mental, and spiritual dimensions (Matt. 4:1–11).
        For us. Christ appears in the heavenly sanctuary in the presence
     of God “for us” (Heb. 9:24), and He also is making intercession for
     us (Heb. 7:25). Thank God that we have a Divine Representative
     to appear in the judgment in our place.

      Jesus is in heaven “for us.” What does that mean? How can
      you draw some assurance and security from this wonderful
      truth?

     The One Sacrifice
        As we have seen, a crucial purpose of the earthly sanctuary service
     was to reveal—in symbols, in types, in mini-prophecies—the death
     and high priestly ministry of Jesus. Sin is something too terrible to
     be solved merely by the death of animals (as sad and unfortunate as
     those deaths are). Instead, all of that spilled blood was to point to the
     only solution for sin, and that was the death of Jesus Himself. That
     it took His death, the death of the One who was equal to God (Phil.
     2:6), in order to atone for sin, shows just how bad sin really is.

Read Hebrews 10:1–14. How does this passage contrast the function
     and work of the earthly sanctuary service with the death and high
     priestly ministry of Jesus?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Many crucial truths ring out of these texts, one of the most impor-
     tant being that the deaths of all those animals was not sufficient to
     deal with the sin problem. “For it is not possible that the blood of bulls
     and goats could take away sins” (Heb. 10:4, NKJV). They merely
     point to the solution; they were not the solution themselves. The
     solution was Jesus, His death, and then His ministry in the heavenly
     sanctuary in our behalf.
        Notice another crucial point in these texts: the complete sufficiency
     of Christ’s one death. Though the animal sacrifices had to be repeated
     time and time again, day after day, year after year, Jesus’ single sacri-
     fice was sufficient (after all, look at who was sacrificed!) to cover the
     sins of all humanity. God powerfully revealed this crucial truth when
     the inner veil of the earthly sanctuary was torn supernaturally after the
     death of Jesus (Matt. 27:51).

      Look around at the world, look at the damage that sin has
      caused: the pain, the loss, the fear, the hopelessness. How can
      we learn day by day, moment by moment, to cling to Jesus as
      the only solution to the sin problem in our own lives?

         of Atoning Sacrifice,” pp. 476–488, in Appendix C of The SDA Bible
         Commentary, vol. 7A.

            “Step away from Satan’s voice and from acting his will, and stand
         by the side of Jesus, possessing his attributes, the possessor of keen
         and tender sensibilities, who can make the cause of afflicted, suf-
         fering ones his own. The man who has had much forgiven will love
         much. Jesus is a compassionate intercessor, a merciful and faithful
1
         high priest. He, the Majesty of heaven—the King of glory—can look
         upon finite man, subject to the temptations of Satan, knowing that
         he has felt the power of Satan’s wiles.”—Ellen G. White, Christian
         Education, p. 160.
            “The conscience can be freed from condemnation. Through faith

         about what Christ and God think of us, but about what God thinks of
         Christ, our Substitute.”—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 2,
         pp. 32, 33.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Read Hebrews 2:17. Why was it necessary for Jesus to
3         become human and to suffer before He could become our High
          Priest?

          l
          2 Dwell on the second Ellen G. White statement listed above.
          Look especially at the line: “We are not to be anxious about
          what Christ and God think of us, but about what God thinks
          of Christ, our Substitute.” How does this help us to understand
          what comes before, when she talks earlier about being “made
          perfect in Christ Jesus”?

          l
          3 Our High Priest, Jesus Christ, is the Surety of our salvation,
          and He administers the effects and benefits of His sacrifice and
          blood. With Him on our side, we have nothing to fear. How can
          we take these wonderful truths, so powerfully expressed in the
          book of Hebrews, and apply them to ourselves, especially at
          times of great temptation?

          l
          4 The book of Hebrews is very clear that Jesus’ once-and-for-
          all sacrifice was all that was needed for dealing with sin. What
          should that tell us about any religious practice that claims to
          repeat this sacrifice as a necessity for the forgiveness of sins?

On Jesus’ Side
   Mee Mee comes from a poor family living in a small village in
Myanmar (Burma). Her family had to sell their land to feed their chil-
dren. Her parents couldn’t afford to send her to school, so she went to
work in the rice paddies when she was 13.
   When Mee Mee was 18, she learned that a Christian family in
another town needed a house helper. Her parents let her go, but they
warned her, “Don’t let these people make you become a Christian.”
Her friend had told her that the Christian family was kind, but still she
was afraid.
   Mee Mee was surprised that her new employers treated her as part
of the family. She refused their invitation to join them for worship, but
she listened from the next room as the family sang songs and prayed.
A few days later she shyly joined the family for worship. How can
Christians be so evil that my parents don’t want me to worship with
them? she wondered.
   On Friday Mee Mee and her host mother worked hard to clean the
house and prepare food for Saturday, which she called “Sabbath.” Mee
Mee declined the invitation to worship in the church that met upstairs
in the family’s home. Then her host father asked her to take Grandma
up the stairs and help her during worship. Mee Mee felt awkward, but
the worshipers were so kind that soon she became more comfortable.
   When Mee Mee’s father called to check on her, she told him about
how loving her host family was. He was glad, but he repeated his
warning, “Remember, don’t become a Christian.”
    Mee Mee continued joining the family for worship. Little by little
God’s love seeped through the barriers of her heart. Her host mother
gave her a Bible, and she took turns reading it during worship.
Something in her heart stirred, and she felt drawn to Jesus.
   Mee Mee knows that her parents will be angry when she tells them
that she wants to become a Christian. But she’s convinced that Jesus
is the true God. She feels torn between respect for her family and their
traditions and God’s call.
   “I know that I must stand on Jesus’ side,” Mee Mee says. “I’m pray-
ing for courage to stand true. Please pray for me.”
   Becoming a Christian in Myanmar isn’t easy. Please pray for those
like Mee Mee who have discovered the truth and want to follow Christ.
And remember that your mission offering helps make evangelism in
this largely Buddhist country possible.

      The Pre-Advent
      Judgment


      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Daniel 7, Gen. 3:8–20, 2 Tim.
      2:19, Ps. 51:4, Ps. 96:11–13, 2 Cor. 5:10.

Memory Text: “ ‘ “Then the sovereignty, the dominion, and the
      greatness of all the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be
      given to the people of the saints of the Highest One; His kingdom
      will be an everlasting kingdom, and all the dominions will serve
      and obey Him” ’ ” (Daniel 7:27, NASB).



      A
              s the book of Hebrews so clearly shows, after His death and
              resurrection, Jesus began a new phase of work for us. He
              became our High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary. The visions
      in Daniel 7 and 8 reveal that at some point in history this heavenly
      work of Christ in our behalf had entered a new phase, the judgment.
      This is sometimes called the “eschatological Day of Atonement”:
      eschatological, because it pertains to the end time; Day of Atonement,
      because it is prefigured by the Day of Atonement service in the
      earthly sanctuary.
        Daniel 7, our focus this week, contains a sequence of kingdoms,
      symbolized by four animals, that parallels the sequence in Daniel 2:
      Babylon, Media-Persia, Greece, and Rome.
        As we study, we’ll see that the judgment is good news, because
      our Lord God works for His people. He judges in their behalf before
      the onlooking universe and grants them entrance into Christ’s eternal
      kingdom, the culmination of all their hopes as followers of the Lord.

The Vision and the Judgment
  “A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thou-
sand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten
thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books
were opened” (Dan. 7:10).

Read Daniel 7:1–14. What is happening here?

________________________________________________________

________________________________________________________

________________________________________________________

   After Daniel sees the four beasts, he observes another horn coming
up among the horns of the fourth beast. This “little horn” becomes the
main enemy of God and His saints. Then, suddenly, Daniel’s attention
turns from the dark earth to a bright judgment scene in the heavenly
throne room (Dan. 7:9–14).
   The judgment scene is the pivot of the entire vision and involves
two key figures, the Ancient of Days and the Son of man. Angels also
are there, witnesses to the judgment. The scene unfolds in three steps:
first is the court scene (vss. 9, 10), then the outcome of the judgment
on the beastly powers on earth (vss. 11, 12), and finally the transfer of
dominion and kingdom to the Son of man (vss. 13, 14). God the Father
is portrayed as the majestic Ancient of Days, the wise and sage judge
par excellence. The Son of man represents humanity, Jesus Himself,
in the heavenly court. Jesus used this title many times to refer to
Himself, and at least twice He clearly evoked the images of Daniel 7
(Matt. 24:30, 26:64).
   The Day of Atonement functions as the most natural typological
setting for this heavenly temple scene. In fact, it is portrayed as if the
heavenly High Priest comes, surrounded by clouds of incense, to the
Ancient of Days. In Daniel 7:10, the “books were opened.” Books
play a major role in the heavenly judgment. There are several books
of heavenly origin known in the Bible: the “book of life” (Ps. 69:28,
Phil. 4:3, Rev. 3:5, 13:8, 17:8, NASB), the “book of remembrance”
(Mal. 3:16), the books of “deeds” (Rev. 20:12), and God’s “book”
(Exod. 32:32, 33; Ps. 56:8).

 Imagine being judged by God. (You will be.) Imagine every-
 thing you have ever done being judged. (It will be.) If you have
 to stand on your record, your own deeds, your own good works,
 what hope do you have? What, then, is your only hope in judg-
 ment?
                                                                      73
                M onday November 25

     Judgment Pattern
Read Genesis 3:8–20. What does God do before He pronounces judg-
     ment?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        The concept of an investigative judgment is biblical. God’s judi-
     cial procedure often includes a phase of investigation and inquiry. A
     first instance is reported in Genesis 3, where God investigates before
     He pronounces the verdict (Gen. 3:8–19). God’s dealings with Cain
     (Genesis 4), Babel (Genesis 11), and Sodom (Genesis 18, 19) follow
     a similar pattern. We see God undertaking the same action that He
     requires of the judges in Israel: namely, to “investigate and search out
     and inquire thoroughly” (Deut. 13:14, NASB; see also Deut. 19:18).
        Investigation involves deliberation and fairness. It is often public.
     God allows others to see for themselves what He is doing. In this way,
     when God announces the verdict—be it salvation or condemnation—
     onlookers are assured that God’s action is the best. This is exactly the
     reason why the heavenly judgment in Daniel 7 involves books. The
     books are not for God’s sake, so that He would remember more eas-
     ily, but for the benefit of the celestial beings surrounding Him, who,
     unlike God, don’t know all things.

How does judgment turn out for the saints? Dan. 7:22.
      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

       In talking about the judgment, Ellen G. White wrote: “The fact that
     the acknowledged people of God are represented as standing before
     the Lord in filthy garments should lead to humility and deep search-
     ing of heart on the part of all who profess His name. Those who are
     indeed purifying their souls by obeying the truth will have a most
     humble opinion of themselves. . . . But while we should realize our
     sinful condition, we are to rely upon Christ as our righteousness, our
     sanctification, and our redemption. We cannot answer the charges
     of Satan against us. Christ alone can make an effectual plea in our
     behalf. He is able to silence the accuser with arguments founded not
     upon our merits, but on His own.”—Testimonies for the Church,
     vol. 5, pp. 471, 472.

      How do these words help us to understand why the judgment
      is such good news?

                 T uesday November 26

      Time of the Judgment
Read Daniel 7:7–10, 21, 22, 25, 26. When does the judgment of Daniel
      7 take place?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Both in the vision and in the angelic interpretation, the judgment
      follows as God’s response to the horn’s presumption and climaxes
      with the transfer of the kingdom to God’s saints. The Bible describes
      the judgment as occurring during the time when the horn power is still
      in existence (Dan. 7:8, 9). The horn’s dominion is taken away only
      after the court sits in judgment; then, when the judicial procedures are
      ended, all earthly kingdoms are destroyed (vs. 26).
        What this means, clearly, is that the judgment must take place
      before the Second Coming. It is a pre-Advent judgment that begins
      sometime after “a time, times, and half a time” (vs. 25, NASB). How
      could there be a final reward or punishment if there were not a judg-
      ment that preceded it?
        Indeed, the saints are rewarded at the time of Christ’s advent,
      which presupposes that they have already been judged. Similarly, the
      wicked, including the demonic powers, will be judged during the mil-
      lennium before God executes the final judgment (see Revelation 20).

Why does God need a judgment? Doesn’t “ ‘the Lord know those who
      are His’ ”? 2 Tim. 2:19, NASB.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         Of course our omniscient God is fully aware of who His people are.
      He does not need a judgment in order to decide who is going to be
      saved. The pre-Advent judgment, rather, shows the Judge to be just
      in the saving of His people. Heavenly beings need to be sure that the
      saints are safe to save. As we seek to understand the meaning of the
      judgment, we need to remember the reality of the great controversy
      scenario, which is hinted at in these texts, because we see the angelic
      host witnessing the judgment. Other beings have an interest in the
      final outcome of the plan of salvation.

       “ ‘The Lord knows those who are His’ ” (NASB). How can you
       be sure you are one of “His”? What’s the only way to be sure?
       (Rom. 8:1).
                                                                          75

     When the Judgment Ends
Read Daniel 7 again. What are the results of the pre-Advent judg-
     ment?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        The judgment results in several far-reaching actions:
        1. The Son of man is crowned. He receives “dominion, glory, and a
     kingdom” (Dan. 7:14, NASB).
        2. The saints receive the kingdom forever. The judgment is for the
     benefit of the saints who will receive God’s kingdom (Dan. 7:22).
     Unmistakably, the Son of man and the saints have a very close rela-
     tionship. When the Son of man receives His kingdom, He invites the
     saints to join Him. His kingdom is their kingdom (Dan. 7:27). This
     judgment leads to a time when the King of the everlasting kingdom is
     reunited with His people. This is their greatest reward and His.
        3. The rebellion is defeated and destroyed. The enemies of God’s
     people are judged. After the horn makes war with the saints, it is
     defeated itself and destroyed forever (Dan. 7:25, 26).
        4. The absolute justice of God is demonstrated. Because the judg-
     ment in the heavenly court is public and the angels attend the inquiries
     into human affairs, all can see for themselves that God is fair in His
     actions. He is able to uphold both love and righteousness. Thus, in the
     end, God Himself will be vindicated, and all will acknowledge that
     God is just and that God is love. The whole procedure ensures that the
     universe will be a secure place for eternity (see Ps. 51:4, Rom. 3:4).
        The pre-Advent judgment results in fulfilling the hopes of both God
     and the believers. God’s desire is to save His people and eradicate
     sin while leaving no doubt about His love and justice. Humanity’s
     yearning is to have salvation from sin and its oppression in every form
     and to enjoy eternal life in the presence of the One who loves them.
     The judgment thus becomes the guarantee for an eternal and trusting
     relationship between God and His creation.
        “The great controversy is ended. Sin and sinners are no more. The
     entire universe is clean. One pulse of harmony and gladness beats
     through the vast creation. From Him who created all, flow life and
     light and gladness, throughout the realms of illimitable space. From
     the minutest atom to the greatest world, all things, animate and inani-
     mate, in their unshadowed beauty and perfect joy, declare that God is
     love.”—Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, p. 678.

             T hursday November 28

     Responsible Assurance
Read Psalm 96:11–13. What is the reason for all creation to
     rejoice?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Why would anyone cry out “Judge me, O Lord” (Ps. 7:8, NKJV)?
     The reason is simple. Judgment means salvation: “Save me, O God, by
     Your name, and vindicate me by Your power” (Ps. 54:1, NASB). Psalm
     26 is a heartbreaking plea for justice and righteousness. David expresses
     marvelously the idea that God, the Judge, is always on the side of His
     loyal people and that His judgment is more than desirable (Pss. 26:1,
     35:24, 43:1, 54:1). This is because judgment also implies vindication.
        So, does the pre-Advent judgment threaten our assurance of salvation?
     No, because the outcome of this judgment is certain. It is “in favor of the
     saints” (Dan. 7:22, NKJV). God’s work in the judgment reaffirms our
     forgiveness and intensifies our assurance by making our sins eternally
     irrelevant. Judgment is actually another manifestation of the salvation
     that is ours. The judgment is not the time when God decides to accept or
     reject us; rather, it is the time when God finalizes our choice of whether
     or not we have truly accepted Him, a choice revealed by our works.
        For the believer, then, judgment increases assurance. To put it
     more radically, judgment lies at the heart of the doctrine of Christian
     assurance.

Read Romans 14:10–12 and 2 Corinthians 5:10. How should the
     reality of judgment affect the way in which we live?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        To exempt the righteous from judgment is not what the Bible teaches.
     Though the righteous are vindicated in the judgment and their sins are
     forever blotted out, the anticipation of the judgment encourages them
     to live a life of loyalty and accountability. The assurance of salvation
     is thus accompanied by the motivational impetus for moral behavior.
     Because God has done so much for us, we love Him and seek to express
     that love through being faithful in all that He asks of us.

      Suppose a fellow believer expresses his or her fear of God and
      especially of the judgment. How can you help that person to
      understand the good news about the judgment and to develop a
      personal sense of assurance regarding salvation?
                                                                            77

    Further Study: “He who dwells in the heavenly sanctuary judges
         righteously. His pleasure is more in His people, struggling with temp-
         tation in a world of sin, than in the host of angels that surround His
         throne.”—Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 176.

           “Satan has an accurate knowledge of the sins that he has tempted
         God’s people to commit, and he urges his accusations against them,
         declaring that by their sins they have forfeited divine protection,
         and claiming that he has the right to destroy them. He pronounces
         them just as deserving as himself of exclusion from the favor of
1
         God. . . . But while the followers of Christ have sinned, they have not
         given themselves up to be controlled by the satanic agencies. They
         have repented of their sins and have sought the Lord in humility and
         contrition, and the divine Advocate pleads in their behalf. He who
         has been most abused by their ingratitude, who knows their sin and
         also their penitence, declares: ‘The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan. I gave
2
         My life for these souls. They are graven upon the palms of My hands.
         They may have imperfections of character; they may have failed in
         their endeavors; but they have repented, and I have forgiven and
         accepted them.’ ”—Ellen G. White, Prophets and Kings, pp. 588, 589.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Where did questions about God’s justice, law, and fairness

3         first arise, on earth or in heaven? What are the implications of
          your answer, especially in the context of helping us to under-
          stand why there is a heavenly judgment of any kind?

          l
          2 The Seventh-day Adventist Church has proclaimed the mes-
          sage of the judgment for many years now. Still, Christ has not
          returned. How are we to respond to what seems to be a very long
          time? Why is it so important to remember that, as humans, we
          have a very limited understanding of time itself? Think about
          some of the very long time prophecies in the Bible and how
          someone living in those times could easily have been discouraged
          about what, from their perspective, seemed to be taking forever.

          l
          3 Many Christians believe in the biblical concept of judg-
          ment. (How could they not? It’s all throughout the Bible.) How,
          though, does linking the judgment to the sanctuary help to reveal
          crucial truths about the nature of judgment and the assurance
          that it offers us?

Spreading the Light
   High on a lush mountaintop in Papua New Guinea (PNG) stands the vil-
lage of Kora. People live in simple houses made of roughly cut wood and
a thatched roof. They raise crops of yams, bananas, and sweet potatoes.
   Most of the older people can’t read, and they speak only the local lan-
guage, which we call wontok [one talk]. Teaching them the Bible was a
challenge. But your mission offerings have made it easier. Many adults
come to the children’s Sabbath School to hear Bible stories. We now have
flip charts, modern picture rolls, to illustrate the week’s lessons. These
picture rolls were given to us because people around the world gave a
special Thirteenth Sabbath Offering a few years ago. The flip charts help
focus the attention of children and adults while they hear the stories.
   Recently we received MP3 players, audio devices that contain the entire
Bible plus children’s lessons on them. Because the Bible and the stories are
in pidgin, I listen and then translate the story or Bible text into the wontok.
For those who understand pidgin, I turn up the volume so they can hear the
story in pidgin, and then I translate it so everyone can understand it.
   I teach the kindergarten Sabbath School, and the lessons are on the MP3
player. So, if I can’t get a Sabbath School lesson quarterly, I can still hear
the story and tell the children. To the children, it’s like listening to the
radio, only they’re hearing God’s Word.
   Another important mission project has vastly improved the lives of the
people living in Kora and in similar villages across the rugged Papua New
Guinea terrain. Several years ago, the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering helped
purchase a mission plane for PNG. The plane brings us our Sabbath
School supplies, drops off missionaries or other church officials, and
sometimes carries seriously ill or injured villagers to the hospital just 30
minutes away. Without the mission plane, it would take days of difficult
and dangerous hiking to cross several mountain ridges to the nearest town.
                                Recently, another Thirteenth Sabbath Offering
                              helped raise funds to open medical clinics in
                              several isolated areas. The offering will help
                              thousands more hear God’s Word on MP3 play-
                              ers and will help buy Bibles for children to share
                              with their families across the South Pacific.
                                The people of Kora and across the South
                              Pacific thank church members in places
                              they’ve never heard of for helping in so many
                              ways to teach them about Christ.

     The Little Horn’s Attack
Read Daniel 8, focusing especially on verses 9–14 and verses 23–25.
     What does the little horn power attack?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        The horn power interferes with the worship of the divine “Prince of
     the host” (vs. 11, compare with Josh. 5:13–15). It removes from Him
     (Dan. 8:11, 12) “the daily” (in Hebrew tamid)—a word that refers
     over and over to the daily sacrificial service in the earthly sanctuary
     service. Because the agent of tamid activities at the sanctuary is a
     priest, often the high priest, the horn sought to usurp the role of the
     (high) priest, command its own counterfeit “host,” and take away
     “the daily.” In this case, given the prophetic context (during the time
     of papal Rome), it’s obviously Christ’s high priestly ministry that is
     attacked.
        The horn power thus usurps the responsibilities of the heavenly
     Priest and interrupts the continual worship of God on earth. It acts
     like another “captain of the host,” waging a religious war against the
     divine heavenly Prince, His sanctuary, and His people. It becomes an
     earthly instrument of Satan; it is said to be “mighty, but not by his
     own power” (Dan. 8:24, NKJV), and its activities reflect a cosmic war
     that is fought on two levels, the earthly and the heavenly.
        The little horn follows right after the ram (Media-Persia) and the
     he-goat (Greece); therefore, it must be identified historically as Rome,
     which came after the kingdoms of Media-Persia (Dan. 8:20) and Greece
     (Dan. 8:21). Though the little horn started out as imperial Rome, the
     greater emphasis is on papal Rome, the primary focus of the vision.
        As said before, the “daily” (tamid) refers to Christ’s continual,
     priestly mediation in the heavenly sanctuary (Heb. 7:25; 8:1, 2). The
     “taking away of the daily” by the horn power represents the introduc-
     tion of such papal innovations as a mediating priesthood, the sacrifice
     of the mass, the confessional, and the worship of Mary, by which it
     has successfully taken away knowledge of, and reliance upon, the
     continual ministry of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary.

      None of us is immune to the danger of trying to play God. How
      might you, however subtly, be doing the same thing?

     “How Long?”
        The presumption of the little horn leads to the cry for judgment. As
     the ram and the he-goat became great and then were broken (Dan. 8:4,
     7, 8), so the horn power exalts itself (Dan. 8:9–11). Thus, the question
     comes, How long will the vision be?

What specific issues are prompting the question in Daniel 8:13?
     _________________________________________________________
     _________________________________________________________
     _________________________________________________________
     _________________________________________________________

        Although the question singles out a few activities of the horn, per-
     haps the most horrible ones, it still asks for the length of the entire
     vision; that is, it is asking about the events shown in the vision of
     Daniel 8.
        In the Scriptures, the question “How long?” always asks for the
     present situation to be changed. It is found directed to people by God
     and by His prophets (Exod. 10:3, Num. 14:27, and 1 Kings 18:21). It
     is also directed to God by His people (Ps. 94:3, Rev. 6:10) and by the
     angel of Yahweh (Zech. 1:12). The angelic cry “How long?” (Dan.
     8:13, 12:6) is a lament over continuous distress, a plea for change,
     and a call for divine judgment. Such a question expresses the expecta-
     tion that God will finally triumph.
        As in Zechariah 1:13, where Yahweh replied with “gracious words,
     comforting words” (NASB), the answer to the question in Daniel 8:13
     comes right away: restoration will be underway beginning with a
     period of “2,300 evenings and mornings” (vs. 14, NASB).
        Once we understand the human condition and the prophetic time in
     which we live, we cannot remain silent. The cry “How long?” needs
     to be put forth. As we look around at our world, how can we not plead
     for the Lord to come and usher in a new world “in which righteous-
     ness dwells” (2 Pet. 3:13, NKJV)? Although God is now at work, as
     promised in Daniel 8:14, we want Him to end the reign of evil here
     and return in the glory that He has promised time and again.
      In which situations have you asked God the question, “How
      long?” How do you maintain the assurance that God is indeed
      in control, however dismal your immediate prospects might
      seem and no matter “how long” it is taking to resolve the things
      you want changed?

     Restoration of the Holy
Read Daniel 8:14. What happens at the end of the 2,300 “evenings
     and mornings”?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        The phrase “evenings and mornings” reflects language from the
     Creation account that signifies a day (Gen. 1:5, 8, et cetera). It implies
     that God, using His own creative force, will counter the destructive
     activities of the horn and its host. The Creator causes a change of situ-
     ation, which is actually called for by the question in Daniel 8:13.
        The answer in Daniel 8:14 can be read as, “Until 2,300 evenings-
     mornings, then will the holy [sanctuary] be restored [cleansed].” A
     study of the terms that are parallel to “restore” (from the Hebrew word
     zdq) shows that it has three major meanings: in a relational context,
     it denotes restoration (Isa. 10:22); in the context of the sanctuary,
     it denotes cleansing or purification (Job 4:17, 25:4); and in a legal
     context, it denotes vindication (Job 34:5). The same verb is used for
     God’s intervention in judgment when the righteous are vindicated,
     or declared to be righteous (1 Kings 8:32, Isa. 50:8). The word holy,
     used in Daniel 8:14 (often translated as “sanctuary”), is also used in
     association with holy people (Dan. 12:7). In fact, Daniel 8:24 makes
     it clear that the little horn power, like the little horn power in Daniel
     7, attacks God’s “holy” people.
        Thus, the restoration of the “holy” (or “sanctuary”) in Daniel 8:14
     encompasses the solution to all the problems mentioned previously
     in the question. Not only will judgment be rendered against the little
     horn power, but the sanctuary will be cleansed, and God’s people
     and God’s sanctuary will be given their rightful state. This finds a
     parallel in what happened on the Levitical Day of Atonement (Lev.
     16:20, 30).
        The work of restoration in Daniel 8 equals the divine judgment in
     Daniel 7, where judgment was given in favor of the saints and against
     the evil little horn power.
        The world needs to know that justice and judgment, as predicted in
     Daniel 8:14, will come and that now is the time to accept the salvation
     offered us in Jesus.

      Read Revelation 14:6, 7. How do these verses tie in directly with
      the judgment of Daniel 7 and the cleansing of the sanctuary in
      Daniel 8?
                                                                           83
         W ednesday December 4

     Day of Atonement in Daniel 8
        The target of the horn’s assault is God’s heavenly sanctuary and
     His people. What does the future hold for them? That is what the
     question in Daniel 8:13 asks. However, only the Day of Atonement
     can bring the sanctuary and the people of God back to their right-
     ful state and, thus, justify God in His dealings. So, the answer in
     Daniel 8:14 must be a Day of Atonement activity. In fact, the Day
     of Atonement is the only ritual day that shows the same combina-
     tion of prominent themes as shown in the climax of the vision of
     Daniel 8: sanctuary imagery, purification of sanctuary and people,
     judgment, and creation.
        There are also several terms in Daniel 8 that allude to the Day
     of Atonement. The horn acts in “rebellion” (Dan. 8:12, 13, NIV),
     a term that occurs specifically in Leviticus 16:16, 21 (NIV). It
     describes a defiant sin, and only on the Day of Atonement can the
     sanctuary be cleansed from it. The word holy (qodesh) explicitly
     links Daniel 8:14 with Leviticus 16, where it occurs to designate
     the Most Holy Place (Lev. 16:2, 3, 16, 17, 20, 23, 27, 33). That
     the “holy” is restored to its rightful place is reminiscent of the Day
     of Atonement, when the “holy” is purified from “rebellion” (Lev.
     16:16, NIV). The specific use of the animal imagery of the ram
     and he-goat also alludes to the Day of Atonement (Lev. 16:5), as
     does the further designation of the goat as the “shaggy” one (Dan.
     8:21, NASB), a description used for the two goats at the Day of
     Atonement.
        The horn’s war in the realm of religion is countered and cut short
     by divine intervention carried out in the context of an eschatologi-
     cal Day of Atonement. At last, terror finds its end, and God’s
     people, the true worship, and the sanctuary are restored to their
     rightful position and, in the final analysis, God Himself is vin-
     dicated. As God demonstrated on the Day of Atonement that He
     is just in His dealings and judgments by forgiving the loyal and
     judging the disloyal and rebellious, so the eschatological Day of
     Atonement will verify that God is just when He saves and when
     He punishes.

      Whatever else we can learn from Daniel 8:14, it should tell us
      that, even after all these long centuries, the Lord has not forgot-
      ten His promises to us and that He will punish evil and reward
      His saints. How can you learn to hold on to those promises,
      especially during times of trial? After all, without these prom-
      ises, what hope do you have?

     Daniel 8 and 9
        The term for “vision” (in Hebrew, chazon) in the question in
     Daniel 8:13 refers to the entire vision in Daniel 8:3–11 (see Dan.
     8:1, 2, 13, 15) and encompasses the time of Media-Persia (ram),
     Greece (he-goat), and papal Rome (little horn). When the length of
     the vision is given as “2,300 evenings and mornings,” we should
     therefore understand it as covering the span from Media-Persia
     to the end time. The text repeatedly emphasizes that the vision
     pertains to the “time of the end” (Dan. 8:17, 19) and “many days
     in the future” (Dan. 8:26, NASB). Because of its length, a literal
     2,300 days is nowhere near long enough to cover the time span
     of the vision. Therefore, we need to interpret it by the day-year
     principle as 2,300 years, following the example of Ezekiel 4:5, 6
     and Numbers 14:34.
        The question remains: When do the 2,300 years begin?
        Bible scholars, both Jewish and Christian, have seen a strong
     link between Daniel 8:14 and Daniel 9:24–27, long viewed as a
     powerful prophecy pointing to the coming of the Messiah, Jesus.

Read Daniel 9:24–27. What is happening in these verses? How is this
     linked to Daniel 8:14?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

       While the word vision (chazon) refers to the entire prophecy
     of Daniel 8, another word, mareh, translated as “vision,” points
     specifically to the “vision [mareh] of the evenings and mornings”
     (Dan. 8:26, NASB). It is this mareh, that of the 2,300 days, that
     Daniel did not understand (Dan. 8:27). The angel had explained
     everything else.
       Several years later, the same angel, Gabriel, appeared to Daniel
     to give him a message so that he would “understand the vision
     [mareh]” of the 2,300 days (Dan. 9:23, NKJV). The 70-week
     prophecy in those verses helps us to understand the prophetic time
     element of Daniel 8:14. It is the verb decreed at the beginning
     of Daniel 9:24, which is best translated as “apportioned” or “cut
     off,” that specifically suggests that the 70 weeks compose a part
     of the longer period of 2,300 days. Thus, the 70-week prophecy is
     “cut off ” from the larger 2,300 day prophecy of Daniel 8:14. This
     gives us the starting point for the prophetic time period depicted in
     Daniel 8:14. (See tomorrow’s study for more details.)
                                                                      85

    Further Study: Ellen G. White, “What Is the Sanctuary?”
         pp. 409–422; “The Holy of Holies,” pp. 423–432, in The Great Controversy.

            In Daniel 9:24–27, the beginning of the 70 weeks is marked by “the
         issuing of a decree to restore and rebuild Jerusalem” (Dan. 9:25, NASB).
         The book of Ezra reports on three decrees that concern Jerusalem and the
         temple, but the third, reported in Ezra 7:12–26, is the most effective one.
1
         The Persian King Artaxerxes I issued the decree in 457 b.c. It involves
         both the reconstruction of the temple and the rebuilding of Jerusalem as a
         political and administrative center (Ezra 7:25, 26). In the Bible, only this
         decree is followed by thanksgiving that praises God for influencing the
         king (Ezra 7:27, 28). Furthermore, only with 457 b.c. as a starting point do
         the 70 weeks (that is, 490 years) reach the time of Christ, the “Messiah, the
2
         Prince” of Daniel 9:25–27. Thus, the prophecy of the 70 weeks provides
         the precise event to date for the beginning of the 2,300 evenings and morn-
         ings. They start in 457 b.c. and end after 2,300 years in a.d. 1844.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 If possible, get a more detailed explanation of the link between
          Daniel 8:14 and Daniel 9:24–27 and study the close connection
          between them. What should it tell us about the importance of
          the prophecy of Daniel 8:14 that it is so closely linked to such a
          major prophecy as Daniel 9:24–27?

          l
          2 Ellen G. White wrote: “The subject of the sanctuary and the
          investigative judgment should be clearly understood by the peo-
          ple of God. All need a knowledge for themselves of the position
          and work of their great High Priest. Otherwise it will be impos-
          sible for them to exercise the faith which is essential at this time
          or to occupy the position which God designs them to fill.”—The
          Great Controversy, p. 488. What do you think she meant by this?
          Why are these things so important for us to understand?

          l
          3 When talking about the little horn, the prophecies of Daniel 7
          and 8 are dealing solely with Rome, and nothing else—not com-
          munism (as some have said in the past) or Islam (as some now
          say). How, though, do we remain faithful to our beliefs without
          causing undue hurt to others? Why must we show that our con-
          cern is with a system, not with the people caught up in it?

Stubborn Atheist
   I was an atheist. I taught physics and astronomy in a secondary school
in Bulgaria and was responsible for teaching atheism. Then my brother
became a Seventh-day Adventist Christian. I knew nothing about what he
had gotten into, but I was sure it was trouble.
   My brother told me of a man in his workplace who read his Bible during
work breaks. He gave my brother some Bible literature and signed him
up for a Bible course. My brother invited me to study the Bible course,
too, but I refused to listen to one word about God. Karl Marx had said
that religion is the opiate of the people, and I refused to be tainted by it.
   He kept urging me to study the Bible, and I finally agreed to read the les-
sons, but only so I could show him the errors of these studies. I read through
them quickly until I got to the lesson about the second coming of Christ. It
caught my interest. I went back and reread the earlier lessons and even filled
in the study sheet. I grew impatient for the next lesson to arrive.
   I began to visit my brother’s church. It was small and quite conserva-
tive. I experienced God’s presence and love in that church. I was learning
to love others just because Jesus loves them. He relies on us to be His
light in this world.
   In my attempt to prove my brother’s new faith wrong, I found the
Savior.
   My brother eventually became a pastor, and I prayed that God would
send me to a certain village to share my faith. God answered my prayer in
an unexpected way. I was asked to become women’s ministries director
for the Western Bulgaria Conference. I had been thinking of teaching a
few old ladies in a village, but suddenly the church entrusted to me the
care of all women in western Bulgaria! I am amazed that God could trust
me with such a responsibility.
                                God has used this new role to help me min-
                             ister to mothers with children who are not in
                             the faith and to families experiencing abuse
                             and to help women find and fulfill their roles
                             in ministry to their families, their church, and
                             their society.

                             to reach others for Christ. If my brother’s col-
                             league hadn’t given him material to read, who
                             knows where I would be today. Thank you.

      heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water’ ” (Revelation 14:
      6, 7, NKJV).



     T
            he judgment message of Daniel 7 and 8 links directly to the
            great controversy scenario depicted in Revelation 12–14. Here
            we find the three angels’ messages, which contain the themes
      of creation, judgment, and gospel (Rev. 14:6–12). These texts present
      God’s urgent and final call to prepare for the second coming of Jesus.
        The message of the first angel is indeed the “everlasting gospel”
      because it’s the same truth that the apostles preached when they said
      that people “should turn from these useless things to the living God,
      who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and all things that are in them”
      (Acts 14:15, NKJV; compare with Act 4:24). Highlighting the impor-
      tance of the message is the fact that the word gospel itself appears only
      here in the book of Revelation. Whatever we preach about end-time
      events, we must make certain that the “gospel” is at the core.

      Time of Disappointment
Read Revelation 10. What is the message of the angel with the little
      scroll? What does it mean to “prophesy again”?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        The portrayal of the angel recalls the description of Christ (Rev.
      1:13–16) and of the divine-like “man in linen” in Daniel’s last vision
      (Dan. 10:5, 6; 12:5–7), suggesting that they are identical. In Daniel
      12:6, 7, He swore by the One who lives forever as He gave the
      prophecy of three and a half times (1,260 years). This is a repetition
      of the crucial prophecy given in Daniel 7:25, describing that God’s
      people would face terrible persecution, another truth that is repeated
      in Daniel 12:7, as well.
        The book of Daniel was supposed to be sealed until the end of time.
      Then it would be opened, and many would gain knowledge from it
      (Dan. 12:4–9). When the prophesied period of 1,260 years ended, the
      time had come to open the book for further knowledge. This is sym-
      bolized by the open book in the hand of the angel in Revelation 10.
      From then on, Daniel’s prophecies were to be better understood.
        At the same time, Revelation 10 reveals that the experience would
      not be totally pleasant. John ate the book as commanded, and it was
      sweet in his mouth but bitter to his stomach. John stands symbolically
      for the people who internalized the book of Daniel. This prophetic
      description, we believe, was fulfilled in the Millerite movement,
      which arose in the first half of the nineteenth century amid great
      worldwide interest in end-time events. It also describes the bitter dis-
      appointment of those who understood that the long-time prophecies in
      Daniel referred to their time, but not in the way they had first thought.
      The “2,300 evenings and mornings” did not signal the return of Christ
      but, rather, the beginning of the great judgment scene of Daniel 7.
        Right after the bitter experience, John was told to “prophesy again
      concerning many peoples and nations and tongues and kings” (Rev.
      10:11, NASB). This is being fulfilled as Seventh-day Adventists
      preach the “everlasting gospel” to the world.

       Disappointment isn’t alien to Christians, especially when they
       misinterpret the meaning of events. Certainly the experience of
       the disciples between their Master’s death and His resurrection
       was a disappointment. Such was the experience of the Millerites
       in 1844. How can we handle disappointments without losing our
       faith? What Bible promises can you hold on to during your own
       times of disappointment?
                                                                           89
                M onday December 9

     Fear God!
The first angel’s message tells us to “fear God.” What does that
     mean? See Ps. 34:7–22.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Fear could be understood in two ways. First, there is a fear that
     shows itself in reverence and respect. This kind is what the first angel
     wants to bring to our attention. Those who fear God are true believers
     in Him (Rev. 11:18). To fear God means to honor Him (Rev. 14:7),
     praise Him (Rev. 19:5), obey Him (Rev. 14:12), and glorify His
     name (Rev. 15:4). The fear of God in the first angel’s message also
     acknowledges God as Judge and as Creator, and it calls us to worship
     Him as such.
        Second, there is a fear in the sense of being afraid that sooner or
     later God will judge this world. To the unfaithful, the message of the
     judgment is a message of terror. That’s why we often call the three
     angels’ messages God’s last warning to the world. Inherent in the very
     notion of a “warning” is something to be feared, and if we read about
     that which the lost will face, they indeed do have something to fear.
        However, as long as mercy is available, God always desires to
     move the lost to repentance, and the fear of God could be an incen-
     tive to start seeking Him (see Rev. 11:13). Though ultimately a saving
     relationship with God is one based on love, sometimes people need a
     good dose of fear to open their eyes. And if it takes a warning to get
     their attention, why not?

      We know that “God is love,” and nothing reveals this love more
      than the Cross. We know, too, that God loves this world, and
      it must pain Him tremendously to see what sin has done to it.
      A God of love and justice isn’t going to sit by forever and let
      evil go unpunished. “It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands
      of the living God” (Heb. 10:31, NKJV). How can we strike the
      right balance in understanding both God’s love for us and
      understanding His wrath against the evil that has done us all
      so much harm?

     The Rage of Nations
Read Revelation 14:7. What judgment is this verse talking about?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        The judgment proclaimed here begins before the return of Christ,
     which is described in Revelation 14:14–20. It is, therefore, the same
     as the pre-Advent judgment of Daniel 7. Its beginning, which Daniel
     8:14 anchors in the year 1844, coincides with the fact that the three
     angels’ messages call people to worship God and turn away from the
     beast and its “image.” This “image” came into existence only after
     the prophetic 42 months, as with the 1,260 days (because they are the
     same thing), which ended in a.d. 1798 (Rev. 13:3–5, 12–14).
        As the final call in Revelation 14:6–12 goes out, the door of mercy
     is still open, because people are still being called to turn away from
     Babylon and worship the true God.

What does God’s judgment encompass? Rev. 11:17, 18.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        God reacts to the rage of the nations by revealing His power.
     Revelation 13 depicts this rage, which Satan’s wrath has incited (Rev.
     12:17). From the perspective of the oppressed believers, whose peren-
     nial plea is the call for divine judgment (Rev. 6:10), the judgment
     might seem long overdue. However, it begins at the prophesied time,
     and the eschatological Day of Atonement takes its course all accord-
     ing to God’s plan.
        Revelation 11:17, 18 gives a short overview of God’s judgment.
     It begins in heaven and is brought to earth, when God destroys the
     wicked powers that corrupted humanity (Rev. 19:2). God’s wrath
     originates in the heavenly sanctuary and is poured out in the seven
     plagues (Revelation 15–18).
        At the Second Advent, God will also reward the faithful (Rev.
     22:12). Finally, God judges the dead and eradicates evil (Rev. 20:11–
     15). When all is over, God’s character stands vindicated before the
     onlooking universe. Everyone can see that He is just and fair in all
     His ways. For now, our challenge is to cling to Him with all our hearts
     and souls and minds, trusting that all this will come to pass in God’s
     appointed time.

                                                                        91

     Worship the Creator
        The heart of the book of Revelation is about worship. While the
     dragon, the beast from the sea, and the beast from the earth (often called
     “the false trinity”) join forces to unite the world in worshiping them (see
     Rev. 13:4, 8, 12, 15; 14:9, 11), God calls the human race to worship the
     Creator (Rev. 14:7). Those who do not worship the “image of the beast”
     risk losing their temporal lives (Rev. 13:15; see also Daniel 3), while
     those who do worship that image lose eternal life (Rev. 14:9–11).
        What a choice!

Read Revelation 14:12. What does this teach us about the role of
     God’s commandments in the final conflict?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

       Worship is inextricably connected with God’s commandments.
     Revelation 13 and 14 are full of allusions to the Ten Commandments:
     “image” (Rev. 13:14, 15; 14:9, 11), idolatry (Rev. 13:4, 8, 12, 15;
     14:9, 11), blasphemy (Rev. 13:1, 5, 6), the Sabbath (Rev. 14:7), mur-
     der (Rev. 13:10, 15), and adultery (Rev. 14:4, 8). The final “contest
     will be between the commandments of God and the commandments
     of men.”—Ellen G. White, Prophets and Kings, p. 188.
       Since the rise of the theory of evolution, it has become particularly
     important for us to uphold and affirm our belief in a six-day Creation.
     This teaching is the foundation of our worship of the Lord as Creator.
     Evolution, even a kind that purports to believe in the Bible, guts
     Seventh-day Adventism of all that it stands for. Without Creation, the
     belief in the “everlasting gospel,” among other teachings (such as the
     Sabbath), is seriously compromised, even negated.
       The verse that describes God as having “made heaven and earth,
     [and] the sea” alludes to the Sabbath commandment (Exod. 20:11).
     The Sabbath is the central issue in the conflict over God’s com-
     mandments. As with no other commandment, the designated day of
     worship is suited for a test of loyalty because it cannot be deduced by
     logical reasoning. We keep it only because God has commanded us
     to do so. Creation also goes hand in hand with judgment. The phrase
     “springs of water” (Rev. 14:7) alludes to the Flood (Gen. 7:11) and
     points to God as the righteous Judge of the world (2 Pet. 3:5–7).

      Nothing we believe as Seventh-day Adventists makes sense when
      taken apart from the Lord as Creator, and nothing in the Bible
      is as clear a sign of God’s creatorship as the Sabbath. How seri-
      ously do you take the Sabbath? How can you have a deeper expe-
      rience with the Lord through obedience to this commandment?

The “Patience” of the Saints
   The second and third angels’ messages of Revelation are a warning
to all who do not heed the divine call of the first angel’s message.
If people continue on their wrong path, they will partake of God’s
seven last plagues, which are seen as “the wine of the wrath of God”
(Rev. 14:10), and this wine will be poured out on those who remain
in Babylon.
   In the Bible, Babylon stands for rebellion against God (Gen.
11:1–9; Jeremiah 50, 51). Babylon arrogantly assumes the place
of God and is the enemy of God’s people. By the time of the New
Testament, Babylon had become a code word for Rome (1 Pet. 5:13).
In the book of Revelation, the harlot Babylon is a religious-political
power in opposition to God and to His people and, as such, attempts
to control the world. Revelation 13:15–17 describes the “Babylonian
crisis” when the beastly powers of Revelation 13 join forces to per-
secute the remnant of God. Babylon is thus a symbol of the end-time
alliance of apostate churches together with the corrupt political pow-
ers of the world.
    The message of the three angels calls God’s followers in Babylon
to come out and join the faithful and visible end-time remnant of God
(Rev. 18:4, 5). Yes, there is still a faithful remnant in Babylon, and
they need to hear the Seventh-day Adventist end-time message.
   As we saw yesterday, Revelation 14:12 clearly depicts God’s faith-
ful remnant. The “perseverance,” or “patience,” of the saints does not
describe so much a passive endurance of hostile activities but, rather,
a steadfast awaiting of Christ. The believers not only follow the com-
mandments but also proclaim them to the world.
   At the same time, the “faith of Jesus” can refer to the believers’
“faith in Jesus” (NASB) and also to Jesus’ loyalty that carries the
believers faithfully through. The end of the third angel’s message
directs our eyes to Christ. Through His merits and His loyalty, God’s
people are able to persevere and keep His commandments. “Several
have written to me, inquiring if the message of justification by faith is
the third angel’s message, and I have answered, ‘It is the third angel’s
message in verity.’ ”—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 1,
p. 372.

 However central the commandments of God are to the final
 crisis, Ellen G. White says that justification by faith is the
 third angels’ message “in verity.” How does this help us to
 understand why, first and foremost, we must rely only on Jesus
 and His merits for salvation as the great hope that will get us
 through the final crisis?

         Ellen G. White, see the following: for the first angel’s message, see
         “Heralds of the Morning,” pp. 299–316, “An American Reformer,”

         Awakening,” pp. 355–374, in The Great Controversy. For the second
         angel’s message, see “Prophecies Fulfilled,” pp. 391–408, “What Is
         the Sanctuary?” pp. 409–422, “In the Holy of Holies,” pp. 423–432, in
         The Great Controversy. For the third angel’s message, see “God’s Law
1
         Immutable,” pp. 433-450, “A Work of Reform,” pp. 451–460, in The
         Great Controversy.

            “Of all professing Christians, Seventh-day Adventists should be fore-
         most in uplifting Christ before the world. The proclamation of the third
         angel’s message calls for the presentation of the Sabbath truth. This
2
         truth, with others included in the message, is to be proclaimed; but the
         great center of attraction, Christ Jesus, must not be left out. It is at the
         cross of Christ that mercy and truth meet together, and righteousness
         and peace kiss each other. The sinner must be led to look to Calvary;
         with the simple faith of a little child he must trust in the merits of the
         Saviour, accepting His righteousness, believing in His mercy.”—Ellen
         G. White, Gospel Workers, pp. 156, 157.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Warnings play a significant role in our society and in our daily
          dealings with each other. In most cases, warnings are for the good
          of those being warned. How can we present the fearful warnings
          found in the three angels’ messages in a way that reveals the won-
          derful hope that they offer?

          l
          2 Seventh-day Adventist beliefs and evolution are inherently
          contradictory. To paraphrase a fundamentalist atheist, evolution
          is an “acid” that erodes everything it touches. This would espe-
          cially include the three angels’ messages of Revelation 14, which
          have the central theme of Creation and Redemption, two truths
          nullified by evolution, even a “theistic” kind. (Who would want
          to worship a theos who created like that, anyway)? Why must we
          as a church never allow the false science of evolution to make any
          inroad into our teachings?

          l
          3 In the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the three angels’ mes-
          sages of Revelation 14 are a treasured beacon that encapsulates
          the divine end-time message that we are called to proclaim.
          Although many church members have certainly heard about these
          messages, some may still have questions about what they really
          mean. How would you explain briefly the meaning of the last call
          of God to this world, and what it entails?

The Ghost Dancer, Part 1
   I am Daniel—at least that is the name I have taken. I live in the country
of Benin, the birthplace of voodoo.
   My grandmother was a voodoo priestess; so was my mother. People
would come and whisper their problem or their wish into a seashell, which
the priestess throws on the ground. How it lands tells the priestess what
the problem is. The priestess tells the person what they must do and bring
to receive what they wish. The person pays with money, alcohol, or an
animal.
   My father worshiped the spirits of dead people and called on them to
bring peace to people who were troubled.
   My father initiated me into the secrets of voodoo. He invited me to be
a ghost dancer, a person who dances during certain voodoo ceremonies.
He told me that if I danced well, people would give me money, and he
warned me that if others became jealous of me, they would try to kill me.
I agreed to join the ghost dancers.
   The dancing ghosts were hired to perform for a ceremony. We all
danced, but I danced very well and got a lot of money. I didn’t think any-
one was jealous, but when I returned home I did not feel well.
   My legs swelled and became painful. My father suspected that someone
had put a curse on me. He said it was urgent that I get treatment immedi-
ately, or I could die. I was afraid. I went to an old voodoo priest, and a few
days later I felt better. But I decided this devil dancing was too dangerous
and I needed to get out of it—fast.
   I had met some Christians, but I didn’t think their God was any differ-
ent from voodoo gods. But after my brush with death, I wasn’t willing to
make fun of anyone’s God. So when I heard an evangelist speaking one
day, I stopped to listen.
                                 I felt that the speaker spoke right to me. I
                              continued to attend the meetings, and when the
                              speaker invited people to follow Jesus Christ,
                              I decided I must obey. But I knew my parents
                              would be angry, so I didn’t tell them.
                                 I studied the Bible with the pastor who had
                              spoken at the meetings. When I was ready, I
                              went to a distant city to be baptized. I realized
                              that sooner or later, I’d have to tell my parents.
                              But I didn’t look forward to it.
                                                        (Continued next week.)

      The Cosmic Conflict Over
      God’s Character




      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Ezek. 28:12–17, Isa. 14:
      12–15, Job 1:6–12, Zech. 3:1–5, 1 John 4:10, 2 Tim. 4:8, Ezek. 36:23–27.

      Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments”
      (Revelation 16:7).



     S
            eventh-day Adventists understand reality through the biblical
            concept of the “great controversy between Christ and Satan.” To
            use a term from philosophy, the great controversy is the metanar-
      rative—the grand, overarching story that helps to explain our world
      and the things that happen in it.
          Central to this controversy is the sanctuary, which, as we have
      seen, presents a recurrent theme that runs from the beginning to the
      end of salvation history: Redemption of humanity through the death
      of Jesus. Properly understood, the sanctuary message also helps to
      illustrate God’s character, which Satan has been attacking since the
      great controversy first began in heaven.
         This week we will study some milestones in the great conflict
      between Christ and Satan that reveal the truth about God’s character
      and that expose Satan’s lies.

     Revolt in the Heavenly Sanctuary
Read Ezekiel 28:12–17 and Isaiah 14:12–15. What do these verses
     teach about Lucifer’s fall?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        At first glance, Ezekiel 28:12 seems to be talking about only an
     earthly monarch. Several aspects, however, suggest that this verse is
     really referring to Satan.
        For starters, this being is referred to as the anointed cherub “who
     covers” (Ezek. 28:14, NKJV), which recalls the Most Holy Place of
     the earthly sanctuary, where two cherubim covered the ark and the
     presence of the Lord (Exod. 37:7–9). This celestial being also walked
     in the midst of the fiery stones, that is, on the “holy mountain of God”
     (Ezek. 28:14) and in the center of “Eden, the garden of God” (Ezek.
     28:13, NKJV)—both of which are sanctuary images. The covering of
     precious stones described in verse 13 contains nine stones that are also
     found in the high priestly breast garment (Exod. 39:10–13), indicating
     another reference to the sanctuary.
        After having described the surpassing splendor of the cherub, the
     text moves to his moral fall. His glory went to his head. His beauty
     made his heart haughty, his splendor corrupted his wisdom, and his
     “trading”—which probably refers to his slandering of the character of
     God and stirring up rebellion—made him violent.
        Also, arrogant earthly powers seek to move from earth toward
     heaven. In Isaiah 14:12–15, the “son of the morning” (Latin lucifere,
     from which comes the name Lucifer) goes in a different direction:
     he falls from heaven to earth, indicating his supernatural rather than
     earthly origin. Other phrases like “throne above the stars of God,”
     “mount of the congregation” in the far north, and “Most High” rein-
     force the impression that this is a celestial being. While verses 12 and
     13 are in past tense, verse 15 suddenly changes to the future. This
     change in time signals that there was first a fall from heaven to earth
     (Isa. 14:12) and that there will be a second fall, from earth to Sheol
     (the grave), sometime in the future (Isa. 14:15). This does not refer to
     any Babylonian king; it is, instead, a clear reference to Lucifer.

      A perfect being created by a perfect God falls into sin? What does
      this tell us about the reality of moral freedom in God’s universe?
      And what does such freedom reveal to us about God’s character?

     The Accusations
       After his fall from heaven, Satan attempted to distort and slander
     God’s character. He did this in Eden (Gen. 3:1–5), in the midst of
     the first “sanctuary” on earth. Satan brought his rebellion, which
     originated in the heavenly sanctuary, down to the earthly sanctuary
     of Eden. After initiating contact with Eve through the medium of the
     serpent, he openly planted the idea in her mind that God was depriv-
     ing both Adam and her of something that would be good for them, that
     He was holding something back that they should have. In this way,
     however subtly, he was misrepresenting God’s character.
       The fall of Adam and Eve set Satan temporarily on the throne
     of this world. Several texts suggest that Satan had gained access to
     the heavenly court again, but now as the “ruler of this world” (John
     12:31, NKJV), as one who possesses the earth but does not own it,
     much like a thief.

Read Job 1:6–12 and Zechariah 3:1–5. How is the great controversy
     revealed in these texts?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        These texts give us a glimpse of the heavenly side of the great con-
     troversy. Satan presents Job’s righteousness as simply self-serving:
     if I am good, God will bless me. The implication is that Job doesn’t
     serve God because God is worthy, but because it’s in Job’s best inter-
     ests. Once it becomes clear that serving God won’t bring blessing, Job
     will abandon his faith.
        In the case of the high priest Joshua (a sanctuary motif) and of other
     believers (see Rev. 12:10), Ellen G. White says that Satan “is accus-
     ing the children of God, and making their case appear as desperate
     as possible. He presents before the Lord their evil doings and their
     defects.”—Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 167.
        In both cases, though, the real issue is the justice of God. The ques-
     tion behind all accusations is whether or not God is fair and just in His
     dealings. God’s character is on trial. Is it fair when God saves sinners?
     Is God just when He declares the unrighteous to be righteous? If He
     is just, He must punish the unrighteous; if He is gracious, He must
     forgive them. How can God be both?

      If God were only a God of justice, what would be your fate, and
      why would you deserve it?

     Vindication at the Cross
       From the very beginning, God left no doubt that He would invali-
     date Satan’s accusations and demonstrate His ultimate love and
     justice. His justice demands that there be payment of the penalty for
     humanity’s sin. His love seeks to restore humanity into fellowship
     with Him. How could God manifest both?

How did God demonstrate both His love and justice? 1 John 4:10,
     Rom. 3:21–26.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

       God’s character of love and justice has been revealed in its fullest
     manifestation by the death of Christ. God loved us and sent His Son
     to be the atoning Sacrifice for our sins (1 John 4:10, John 3:16). By
     paying in Himself the penalty for violating the law, God showed His
     justice: the demands of the law had to be met. They were met at the
     cross, but in the person of Jesus.
       At the same time, by this act of justice, God was also able to reveal
     His grace and love, because Jesus’ death was substitutionary. He died
     for us, in our stead, so that we don’t have to face that death ourselves.
     This is the amazing provision of the gospel, that God Himself would
     bear in Himself the punishment that His own justice demanded, the
     punishment that legitimately belonged to us.
       Romans 3:21–26 is a biblical jewel on the theme of God’s righ-
     teousness and the redemption in Jesus Christ. Christ’s sacrificial
     death is a demonstration of God’s righteousness so “that He might be
     just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus” (Rom. 3:26,
     NASB).
       Again, sanctuary imagery provides the framework for Christ’s
     death. In previous weeks, we have seen that His death is a perfect,
     substitutionary sacrifice and that Christ is the “atonement cover”
     (Rom. 3:25). In short, both Testaments reveal that Christ’s mission
     was typified by the earthly sanctuary service.

      “With intense interest the unfallen worlds had watched to see
      Jehovah arise, and sweep away the inhabitants of the earth. . . .
      But instead of destroying the world, God sent His Son to save
      it. . . . At the very crisis, when Satan seemed about to triumph,
      the Son of God came with the embassage of divine grace.”—Ellen
      G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 37. What does this quote tell you
      about the character of God?
                                                                          99

      Vindication in the Judgment
        As Scripture has shown, God’s judgment is good news for those of
      us who believe in Him, who trust in Him, and who are loyal to Him,
      even though “we cannot answer the charges of Satan against us.”
      —Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 472. How-
      ever, the judgment is not only for us. It also serves the purpose of
      vindicating God before the entire universe.

How is God’s character presented in the following texts about judg-
      ment? Ps. 96:10, 13; 2 Tim. 4:8; Rev. 16:5, 7; 19:2.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         God’s character will be revealed in His judgment. What Abraham had
      already understood will, in the end, be manifest to all humanity: “ ‘Shall
      not the Judge of all the earth deal justly?’ ” (Gen. 18:25, NASB). The
      different phases of judgment, with their open-book investigation, make
      sure that the angels (in the pre-Advent judgment) and the righteous (in the
      millennial judgment) can prove and be reassured that God is just in His
      dealings with humanity and that He has been merciful in each case.

Read Philippians 2:5–11. What amazing event do these verses depict?
      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         Verses 9–11 predict the exaltation of Christ. The main two actions
      express the same thought: Jesus is Lord, and all creation will acknowl-
      edge Him as such. First, “every knee should bow” (vs. 10, NASB). The
      bowing of the knee is a customary act for recognizing the authority of
      a person. Here it refers to rendering homage to Christ and recognizing
      His supreme sovereignty. The dimension of the homage is universal. “In
      heaven and on earth and under the earth” (NASB) comprises every liv-
      ing being: the supernatural beings in heaven, the living on earth, and the
      resurrected dead. Those who will pay homage don’t seem to be limited to
      the saved. Everyone will acknowledge His lordship, even the lost.
         The second action is that everyone “should confess that Jesus Christ
      is Lord” (vs. 11, NASB). In the end, all will acknowledge the justice of
      God in exalting Christ as Lord. In this way, all creation will acknowl-
      edge the character of God, which has been at the center of the great
      controversy, as just and faithful. Even Satan, the archenemy of Christ,
      will acknowledge God’s justice and bow to the supremacy of Christ
      (see Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, pp. 670, 671).

     The Cosmic Spectacle
       During the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus utters these amazing words:
     “Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good
     works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven” (Matt. 5:16).
     With this, He reveals a principle that, though easily misunderstood, is
     nevertheless seen throughout the Bible. It tells how, as followers of
     Christ, we can bring glory or shame to God by our actions.

Read Ezekiel 36:23–27. How was God going to vindicate His name
     in ancient Israel?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        These verses comprise one of the classic passages on the new
     covenant. God desires to work a dramatic transformation among His
     people. He will cleanse them (vs. 25) and grant them a new heart and
     a new spirit (vs. 26) so that they will become a holy people who will
     follow His commandments. What God wants to accomplish is to jus-
     tify and sanctify believers so that by their lives they will honor God
     for who He is and what He does (vs. 23).
        Of course, the key element in vindicating God’s character before
     the universe is the Cross. “Satan saw that his disguise was torn away.
     His administration was laid open before the unfallen angels and
     before the heavenly universe. He had revealed himself as a murderer.
     By shedding the blood of the Son of God, he had uprooted himself
     from the sympathies of the heavenly beings.”—Ellen G. White, The
     Desire of Ages, p. 761.
        At the same time, the New Testament followers of Christ are called
     a “spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men” (1 Cor. 4:9,
     NKJV). That is, what we do is being seen not only by other people
     but by heavenly intelligences, as well. What kind of witness do we
     present? By our lives we can make known the “manifold wisdom of
     God . . . to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places” (Eph.
     3:10, NASB). Or our lives can bring shame and reproach on the name
     of the Lord whom we profess to serve.

      What kind of spectacle, both to other people and to angels, does
      your life present? Is it one in which God is glorified, or one in
      which Satan can exult, especially because you profess to be a
      follower of Jesus?

    Further Study: Ellen G. White, “Why Was Sin Permitted?” pp. 33–43,
          in Patriarchs and Prophets; “The Character of God Revealed in Christ,”
          pp. 737–746, in Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5.

             “There stood in the world One who was a perfect representative
          of the Father, One whose character and practices refuted Satan’s
          misrepresentation of God. Satan had charged upon God the attributes
          he himself possessed. Now in Christ he saw God revealed in His true
          character—a compassionate, merciful Father, not willing that any
          should perish, but that all should come to Him in repentance, and have
1         eternal life.”—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 254.
             “The mission of Christ, so dimly understood, so faintly compre-
          hended, that called Him from the throne of God to the mystery of the
          altar of the cross of Calvary, will more and more unfold to the mind,
          and it will be seen that in the sacrifice of Christ are found the spring
          and principle of every other mission of love.”—Ellen G. White, In
2         Heavenly Places, p. 319.

    Discussion Questions:
           l
           1 Dwell on the idea that, by the time the whole great contro-
           versy ends, every intelligent creature in the universe, including
           Satan and the lost, will acknowledge the justice and fairness
           and righteousness of God in His dealing with sin and rebellion.
           Though it is a very heavy concept for us to grasp, what does this
3
           tell us about the character of God? What does it teach us about
           the reality of moral freedom and just how sacred and basic free-
           dom is to the kind of universe that God has created?

           l
           2 There are many Christians who deny the existence of Satan,
           seeing him as merely an ancient superstition held by primitive
           people who were looking to explain evil and suffering in the
           world. Think about how great a deception such a view is. It’s
           hard to imagine what kind of Christianity could deny the reality
           of a power that is so often revealed in the Bible, especially the
           New Testament, as a real being. What does this tell us about just
           how powerfully influenced some churches are by the inroads
           of modernism and secularism? What can we, as Seventh-day
           Adventists, learn from the mistakes that we see others making in
           order that we not fall into the same deception, as well? Without
           a literal Satan, what happens to the whole great controversy
           theme?

The Ghost Dancer, Part 2
   Shortly after my baptism, my father called me to dance in a big ghost
festival in our home village. I was shaking as I told my father, “No, I
don’t dance anymore.” Father urged me to dance, but I took a deep breath
and told him, “I have found a power that is stronger than witchcraft.” I
knew that my words were a challenge to my father and the ghost dancers.
I prayed that my God would protect me from whatever evil would befall
me.
   When I didn’t show up for the ghost dancers’ practice session in the
bush, some dancers came to remind me it was time to dance. I told them
I wasn’t going to dance. They argued and tried to convince me to go with
them, but I refused. Then these dancers grabbed me and forced me to go
with them.
   We arrived at the place where the ghost dancers were preparing for the
dance. I told them again that I wasn’t going to dance. Someone forced me
to drink something, and I lost consciousness. They tried to wake me, but
I didn’t wake up until the next day, the day of the ceremony. The ghost
dancers tried to get me to dance, but I couldn’t even stand up. Finally my
father came and told them to leave me alone. I slept through the entire
ghost ceremony.
   After the ceremonies ended, my father took me aside and reminded me
of vows I had taken to not tell anyone what we did in our dancing. Then a
friend told me that I must leave the village or face death. I left my village
and haven’t returned.
   I was 18 years old. I had no job and no money. I’d had just three years
of education and wasn’t sure what I could do. I prayed, and God hasn’t
abandoned me. I am learning a trade now so that I can support myself.
   It’s not safe for me to go to my father’s village, for I know that there are
                              people there who would try to kill me. I’m not
                              afraid of them, for I believe that Jesus is stron-
                              ger than voodoo gods. But until God sends me
                              back to my parents’ village, I feel it’s wise to
                              stay away.
                                 I found Christ when a pastor shared God’s
                              love with me. Your mission offering helps
                              spread the good news that Jesus is the only true
                              God. Millions in Benin and around the world
                              are waiting to hear. Thank you for giving them

      Exhortations From the
      Sanctuary


      Sabbath Afternoon
Read for This Week’s Study: Heb. 10:19–25; Heb. 4:16;
      Exod. 24:8; James 4:7, 8; John 13:34; Heb. 10:24, 25.

Memory Text: “And since we have a great priest over the house
      of God, let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance
      of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil con-
      science and our bodies washed with pure water” (Hebrews 10:
      21, 22, NASB).



      T
            hroughout the book of Hebrews, passages about Christian faith
            alternate with passages about Christian living. In other words,
            theology has practical implications. The “what” of faith leads to
      the “how” of living that faith. In Hebrews, after the author has painted
      the magnificent theological picture of Christ as our Sacrifice and High
      Priest (Heb. 7:1–10:18), he encourages and exhorts believers to live
      according to the implications of these truths. This exhortation is espe-
      cially seen in Hebrews 10:19–25.
         This passage is one long, complex sentence in Greek. It consists
      of two basic facts that lead to three exhortations, each starting with
      the phrase “let us,” and each containing the familiar triad of faith,
      hope, and love. Also, each “let us” section contains another facet of
      Christian faith.
         This week we will study Hebrews 10:19–25 and its practical exhor-
      tations for Christian living.

     Access to the Heavenly Sanctuary
Read Hebrews 4:16; 6:19, 20; and 10:19–21. To what do believers
     have access, and what does this mean for us? What hope is offered
     here, and more important, what impact should this hope have on
     our life and faith?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Believers have spiritual access to the heavenly sanctuary, to the
     very throne of God. We can seek closeness to God because our
     “entry” was made possible by the blood of Christ and by His repre-
     sentation in our behalf as our High Priest. The texts assure us that our
     soul has an anchor, Jesus Christ, who is in the very presence of God
     (Heb. 4:14–16; 6:19, 20). The assurance for us is that Christ gained
     full access to God after He was inaugurated as the heavenly High
     Priest (Heb. 6:20). At the inauguration, Christ sat on the heavenly
     throne, an image that demonstrates His royal status (Rev. 3:21).
       The good news for us is that our Representative is in the presence
     of the Father. No mere earthly priest, who himself is sinful, serves on
     our behalf. We have the better Priest. Nothing separates the Father
     from the Son. Because Christ is perfect and sinless, there does not
     need to be a veil that shields God’s holiness from Jesus, our High
     Priest (Heb. 10:20).
       “What does intercession comprehend? It is the golden chain which
     binds finite man to the throne of the infinite God. The human agent
     whom Christ has died to save importunes the throne of God, and his
     petition is taken up by Jesus who has purchased him with His own
     blood. Our great High Priest places His righteousness on the side of
     the sincere suppliant, and the prayer of Christ blends with that of the
     human petitioner.”—Ellen G. White, That I May Know Him, p. 78.
       What assurance we have that we can have close communion with
     the Father, all because of what Jesus has done and is doing for us!

      Dwell on what it means that Jesus is interceding for you in
      heaven. Why do you need that intercession so greatly?

      Cleansed and Sincere
Read Hebrews 10:22. What conditions for approaching God in the
      heavenly sanctuary are laid down in this verse?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

          According to this verse, worshipers should meet four conditions
      when they draw near to God:
         1. Come with a sincere heart. The heart is our inner being, our
      thoughts, our motivations, our emotions, our will, and our character.
      God wants us to be sincere. However, the heart can become sincere
      only if it is cleansed. This doesn’t mean that we are perfect, just that
      we are striving toward revealing the character of Christ.
         2. Come in full assurance of faith. As we saw in yesterday’s study,
      there is no more reason to doubt that we will gain access to God.
         3. Come with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience.
      The sprinkling of the heart is sanctuary language that refers back
      to the blood sprinkled upon the people at the wilderness tabernacle
      (Exod. 24:8; Lev. 8:23, 24), which made them ritually clean but could
      not cleanse their conscience (Heb. 9:9, 13). The cleansing in the
      true tabernacle in heaven, however, is a cleansing of the conscience,
      brought about by the blood of Christ (Heb. 9:14). The justification of
      the repentant sinner is symbolized by this cleansing. We can have a
      clear conscience because we have been forgiven.
         4. Come with our bodies washed with pure water. This sounds like an
      allusion to Christian baptism, but we can also understand it in a more
      spiritual sense as the “washing of water with the word” (Eph. 5:26,
      NASB), reading the Bible and applying its principles to our lives.
         In James 4:7, 8, James struggles with the “double-minded” attitude of
      his readers. They have apparently lost their single-mindedness toward
      God. They have compromised and are in immediate danger. He uses
      language associated with purity at the sanctuary. It is truly a sanctu-
      ary concept that approaching God is possible only if purification takes
      place.

       It should be clear that only God can cleanse our hearts. The
       question is: what painful choices do we make that allow Him to
       do this work of grace in our lives?

     Faith: Be Confident
       Read Hebrews 10:19–25 again. One theme appears again and again,
     and that is “confidence.” The Greek word for “confidence” (Heb.
     10:19) refers to a boldness, courage, and fearlessness that in the New
     Testament describes our new relationship with God.
       Originally, the word referred to an openness of speech, which, in
     this context, could specifically mean that one can freely approach
     God in prayer. This type of openness in our relationship with God
     produces a joyful confidence. The reason and object of our confi-
     dence is that we have a High Priest in heaven through whom we can
     have access to the presence of God. This access is unlimited and not
     blocked by anything but ourselves and our wrong choices. We have
     an open invitation to come into the heavenly sanctuary.
       Where does this confidence come from? It is not produced by
     ourselves but by recognizing, again, that the blood of Jesus has won
     access to God’s presence for us.

There are other texts in Hebrews that speak about confidence and
     assurance: Hebrews 3:6, 14; 4:16; 6:11; 11:1. What kind of confi-
     dence do these texts describe?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Assurance and confidence do not anchor us in ourselves but only
     in Christ. These conditions are not dependent upon who we are but
     who our Mediator is. Interestingly, there is no mention that believers
     would have anything less than “full assurance” (Heb. 6:11, 10:22).
     Obviously, the new way that has been forever opened through
     Jesus’ death will lead without fail to full confidence. Nothing less is
     expected.
        There are two ways to obtain Christian confidence and maintain it
     in faith. One is through faith itself (Eph. 3:12); the other is through
     faithful Christian service for others (1 Tim. 3:13). Both aspects are
     necessary and important. In Hebrews, too, assurance of faith and
     exhortation to prove oneself as a Christian go hand in hand. Christian
     living is never detached from Christian faith.
      What things in life challenge your confidence in God or your
      full assurance of His good will for you? What can you do to help
      to protect yourself from this spiritual danger?

      Hope: Be Steadfast and Unswerving
Look up the texts below. What do they all have in common? What
      should believers hold on to?

      Heb. 3:6 _________________________________________________

      Heb. 3:14 ________________________________________________

      Heb. 4:14 ________________________________________________

      Heb. 6:18 ________________________________________________

      Heb. 10:23 _______________________________________________

         Besides having the assurance of salvation, it is important to persevere
      and uphold the hope offered us all. In Hebrews, to hold fast is a serious
      appeal. One gets the impression that some believers were slipping away
      from their Christian faith and hope. The apostle had to encourage them
      not to let go. The text expresses, quite similarly, the things that are worth
      holding on to: hope, confidence, assurance, and confession. All of these
      terms refer in an objective sense to the Christian belief. We can do these
      things because our hope isn’t in ourselves but in Jesus and what He has
      done for us. The moment we forget that crucial truth, we will surely lose
      confidence.
         These texts challenge us to be steadfast from the “beginning” (Heb.
      3:14) and “until the end” (Heb. 3:6, 14; 6:11). To do so “without waver-
      ing” (Heb. 10:23, NKJV) refers to an immutable and unshaken faith.
      Whatever the circumstance may be, our hope remains the same and our
      commitment to God is unchanged because we can trust that He is faithful
      and will do what He has promised.
         There is no question that God is true to His Word. He fulfilled
      the promise that He made to Abraham and Sarah (see also Rom. 4:
      19–21); He fulfilled the promise of Christ’s first coming (Gal. 3:19); and
      He will also fulfill the promise of His return (Heb. 12:26). God’s ultimate
      promise, however, is eternal life, which He promised even before time
      began (Titus 1:2, 1 John 2:25).
         God’s faithfulness is immovable. Even “if we are faithless, He remains
      faithful; for He cannot deny Himself ” (2 Tim. 2:13, NASB). Our unfaith-
      fulness or disbelief will not change God’s intention for us. His promises
      remain unshaken by our moral lapses. The promises will still be available
      for us because faithfulness is part of the divine nature.

       It is so easy to become discouraged because of our sins. How can
       we overcome those sins, and yet, at the same time, not give up
       when we fail? Why must we cling to these promises, especially
       when we fail?

     Love: Encourage One Another
       “And let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and
     good deeds” (Heb. 10:24, NASB).

        Whereas the exhortation in Hebrews 10:23 focuses on the indi-
     vidual attitude, the next one in Hebrews 10:24 has the community of
     believers in view. We do not walk alone on our path with Christ. We
     should care for one another consistently.
        The challenge to love one another is a traditional component of
     Christian behavior (John 13:34, 35; Gal. 5:13). However, loving one
     another does not just happen naturally. The act of “considering” suggests
     concentrated and careful pondering. We are urged to pay attention to our
     fellow believers and see how we could incite them to love others and to
     do good works. Unfortunately, it is easier to provoke and antagonize oth-
     ers than it is to spur them on to Christian love, isn’t it?
        Then let us consolidate our efforts to work for the best of the com-
     munity so that, because of our inducements to love, others cannot help
     but love and perform good works, as well.

Read Hebrews 10:24, 25. What do “love” and “good deeds” have to
     do with the “assemblies”?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

       One point that Hebrews stresses is that we can express love toward
     one another in Christian gatherings. If someone does not come to
     worship, how can he or she ever fulfill Christ’s law of love? Some
     people may think that they have “good” reasons to stay away from
     Christian meetings. Hebrews, however, touches on the sensitive issue
     that, in the end, it might be their own apathy that keeps them away. If
     one wants, one can always find reasons to avoid church attendance or
     other Christian gatherings. Those reasons, however, pale in contrast to
     one of the reasons for coming: to be a blessing to others.
       Such behavior is all the more pressing as the day of Christ’s return
     comes nearer and nearer. At the beginning of Hebrews 10:19–25, the
     author admonished believers to draw near to God in the heavenly
     sanctuary, and at its conclusion he reminds them that the Day of the
     Lord draws near to them. Christ’s return should always be a major
     incentive for Christian behavior.
      Who in your church do you want to encourage with your words,
      deeds, or just by your presence? If you are deliberate in that
      intention, you can make a big difference in people’s lives and,
      in turn, be blessed yourself.
                                                                         109

    Further Study: “The Mediator, in his office and work, would greatly
          exceed in dignity and glory the earthly, typical priesthood. . . . This
          Saviour was to be a mediator, to stand between the Most High and his
          people. Through this provision, a way was opened whereby the guilty
          sinner might find access to God through the mediation of another. The
          sinner could not come in his own person, with his guilt upon him, and
          with no greater merit than he possessed in himself. Christ alone could
          open the way, by making an offering equal to the demands of the divine
1         law. He was perfect, and undefiled by sin. He was without spot or blem-
          ish. The extent of the terrible consequences of sin could never have been
          known, had not the remedy provided been of infinite value.”—Ellen G.
          White, The Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 2, p. 11.
             “Faith in the atonement and intercession of Christ will keep us
          steadfast and immovable amid the temptations that press upon us in
2         the church militant.”—Ellen G. White, The SDA Bible Commentary,
          vol. 7A, p. 484.

    Discussion Questions:
           l
           1 Skim through the book of Hebrews. What are all the times
           in this book that we are called to act in certain ways, ways that
           directly result from our faith?
3          l
           2 Dwell more on the idea that we have full access to God. What
           does that mean? How should this influence our lives, especially
           in times of temptation or in times of discouragement over our
           spiritual state?

           l
           3 What is the difference between “full assurance” of faith and a
           presumptuous attitude?

           l
           4 Dwell on this line taken from the Ellen G. White quote in
           Friday’s further study: “The extent of the terrible consequences
           of sin could never have been known, had not the remedy pro-
           vided been of infinite value.” What does that tell us about just
           how bad sin is that it cost something of “infinite value,” the life
           of Jesus? How do we understand the idea of “infinite value”?
           How does the fact that Jesus is the Creator help us to grasp this
           amazing truth? Knowing these things, how can our lives not be
           transformed? How can we know these things and not want to
           teach them to others?

           l
           5 How can we develop spiritual friendships in which we encour-
           age one another to be more loving and to live a life of good
           deeds? What spiritual benefits do you gain from “assembling
           together”? What would you miss if you could not worship with
           other Christians in church?

Nurturing Spiritual Roots
  Mi Eh Kim was disappointed. She had arrived in Tokyo from China
to study, but she couldn’t find a Chinese Seventh-day Adventist con-
gregation and didn’t yet understand enough Japanese to understand
people. She was used to worshiping God every Sabbath in China, and
she worried about her spiritual life when she couldn’t go to church.
She prayed to find a place to live closer to a church.
  While Mi Eh studied Japanese, she prayed that God would lead her
to a university located near a Seventh-day Adventist church. She was
accepted at a university outside Tokyo, and to her joy discovered that
a Seventh-day Adventist church was nearby. Members offered to pick
her up on Sabbaths. What an answer to prayer!
  The pastor of the small group of worshipers welcomed her and
introduced her to the members. Instantly Mi Eh felt the warmth of
fellowship and enjoyed the spiritual feast in the town her friends had
told her was cold to foreigners. She looked forward to Sabbaths with
an intensity she found hard to imagine.
  When she graduated she moved back to Tokyo to work. Once more
she searched for a church in which to worship. But this time she
learned that a Chinese-speaking congregation was worshiping in one
of the Japanese churches in the city. How precious it was to worship
God in her mother tongue.
  Mi Eh has been in Japan for ten years now, and sometimes she still
feels like a foreigner. She knows the stress people feel in a foreign
country, and she knows how happy they are to meet with people who
speak their own language. Her church family helps nourish her spiri-
tual roots and makes a huge difference in her life.
  Part of a previous Thirteenth Sabbath Offering has helped nourish
                           this Chinese-speaking church in Tokyo. It
                           has now formed a second congregation so
                           that more Chinese-speaking people can find
                           spiritual nurture in a foreign land.

                               or working in Japan.

2014    Bible Study Guide for the First Quarter

          Christ’s example of disciple-making must be the model that believ-
       ers follow in answering the Great Commission (Matt. 28:19).
          In our study for the first quarter 2014, entitled Discipleship, by Dan
       Solis, we will look at discipleship as the process by which we become
       followers of Jesus and, as such, become better soul winners.
          How did Jesus attract His followers? What can we learn from Christ’s
       example that would enable us to effectively lead others to Him?
          These are not merely discussion questions that stimulate intellectual
       interchange; rather, they are a crucial area of study for Christians
       whose desire is to follow Jesus’ example of guiding lost sheep to the
       loving Shepherd.
          Our study this quarter will focus on these important aspects of dis-
       cipling.

Lesson 1—Disciples and Scripture
       The Week at a Glance:
       Sunday: Jesus and the Bible (Luke 4:1–12, 16–21)
       Monday: The Authority of Scripture (Matt. 5:17–20, 12:3–8)
       Tuesday: Public Proclamation (Matt. 5:17–39)
       Wednesday: Personal Ministry (John 13:18–20, Luke 10:25–28)
       Thursday: The Next Generation (Matt. 12:15–21, Mark 1:1–3)
       Memory Text—John 5:39

       Sabbath Gem: All of our disciple-making endeavors must, ulti-
       mately, be about Jesus and what He has done for us.

Lesson 2—Discipling Through Metaphor
       The Week at a Glance:
       Sunday: Old Testament Examples (2 Sam. 12:1–7, Isa. 28:24–28)
       Monday: Architectural Wisdom (Matt. 7:24–27)
       Tuesday: Agricultural Analogies (Matt. 13:1–30)
       Wednesday: The Revolutionary’s War (Matt. 21:28–32)
       Thursday: Christ’s Creative Legacy (1 Cor. 3:10–15)
       Memory Text—Matthew 13:34, 35, NIV

       Sabbath Gem: Complex concepts like justification, righteousness,
       and sanctification were easily grasped through the Master Storyteller’s
       art. In other words, concepts that are often difficult to grasp in ordinary
       language can be taught through symbols and metaphors.
