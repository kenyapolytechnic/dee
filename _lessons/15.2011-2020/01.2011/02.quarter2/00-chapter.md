         The Adult Sabbath School Bible Study Guide is prepared by the Office of the
         Adult Bible Study Guide of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists.
         The preparation of the guides is under the general direction of the Sabbath
         School Publications Board, a subcommittee of the General Conference
         Administrative Committee (ADCOM), publisher of the Bible study guides. The
         published guide reflects the input of a worldwide evaluation committee and the
         approval of the Sabbath School Publications Board and thus does not solely or
         necessarily represent the intent of the author(s).

                                                                                     1
A Thing Bigger Than Itself

W                e are awash in symbols. Our language, our words (hence our
                 thoughts, even) are symbols, representations of things other than
                 themselves. The letters of the word dog aren’t a dog or any dog.
They’re a symbol, composed of type on a page, made of letters and sounds that, no
matter how construed, never can be what they stand in for. The word dog, in every
tongue and script, represents something bigger than itself.
    Language, culture, society, politics—everything to some degree—come to us
filtered through symbols: flags, icons, pictures, slogans, idioms, art, poetry, sculptures,
dance, architecture, rituals, and customs, with meanings often varying from place to
place. So many things mean more than what they, in and of themselves, are.
    Maybe that’s why the Bible is awash in symbols, as well. In Genesis 2, God made
the seventh day a symbol of all that came before it, the six days of Creation. The
first gospel promise, the first promise of salvation for the fallen race, was revealed
in symbols: seed, head, heel (Gen. 3:15), all referring to a reality much greater than
seeds, heads, and heels. Then, too, when He said to the murderous Cain, “the voice
of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground” (Gen. 4:10), the Lord
Himself was speaking in symbols.
    All through the Bible, symbols, representations of things and ideas bigger than
themselves, appear—the rainbow after the Flood (Gen. 9:13), Joseph’s dreams
(Gen. 37:1–11), the three angels of Revelation 14 (Rev. 14:6–12), the entire sanc-
tuary service of the Old Covenant period (Hebrews 9), the bread and wine of the
Lord’s Supper (Mark 14:22–25). They all point to realities and truths beyond
themselves.
   Of course, as Seventh-day Adventists, we’re all familiar with the prophetic sym-
bolism of Daniel: a winged lion (Dan. 7:4), a beast with iron teeth (Dan. 7:7), a
goat that “touched not the ground” (Dan. 8:5), a statue with feet of iron and clay
(Dan. 2:33). Again, all these are symbols of greater realities.
   Then there’s the powerful symbolism of biblical
poetry: “Who hath measured the waters in the hollow
of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and            All through the
comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and
                                                                Bible, symbols . . .
weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a bal-
ance?” (Isa. 40:12). Or something as simple as “A word          appear. . . . They
fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver”      all point to reali-
(Prov. 25:11).                                                  ties and truths be-
   And the parables Jesus told? The lost sheep (Luke            yond themselves.
15:1–6), the rich man burning in hell (Luke 16:22–31),
the marriage supper (Matt. 22:1–13), and the ten vir-
gins (Matt. 25:1–13) all are symbolic representations
of concepts that, in their essence, have little or nothing to do with their symbols.
(Christ came to give eternal life to a fallen race, not to find lost farm animals.)
   This quarter’s lessons focus on biblical symbolism of a certain kind: clothing
imagery. (We give special thanks to Myrna Tetz for this concept. Myrna, now
retired, was managing editor of the Adventist Review.) We will consider the gar-
ments that people in the Bible wore and what that clothing really meant, what
truths it symbolized, what great realities it pointed to, and what lessons we can learn
from it. From the fanciful adornment of Lucifer in heaven to the filthy rags of our
own righteousness, from the coats of animal skins for Adam and Eve in Eden to the
“garments of splendor” mentioned in Isaiah, the Bible uses clothing and clothing
imagery to portray truths about sin, pride, righteousness, salvation, justification,
resurrection, and eternal life in Christ.
   Though we’re not what we wear, what we wear can say much about who we are.
In that sense, as with all symbols, garments can point to something greater than
themselves.

      In the Loom of Heaven




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Isaiah 64, Rom. 3:21–31,
      4:1–7, 6:1–13, Phil. 3:3–16.

Memory Text: “ ‘Blessed are they whose transgressions are for-
      given, whose sins are covered’ ” (Romans 4:7, NIV).



      C
                hrist is the sinner’s substitute and surety. He has obeyed the law
                in the sinner’s place, in order that the sinner may believe in him,
                and grow up into him in all things to the full stature of a man in
      Christ Jesus, and thus be complete in him. Christ has made reconciliation
      for sin, and has borne all its ignominy, reproach, and punishment; and
      yet while bearing sin, he has brought in everlasting righteousness, so that
      the believer is spotless before God. The time comes when it is asked,
      ‘Who shall lay anything to the charge of God’s elect?’ and the answer
      is, ‘It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again.’ He who has the
      spotless robe of righteousness, woven in the loom of heaven, in which is
      not a thread that sinful humanity can claim, is at the right hand of God, to
      clothe his believing children in the perfect garment of his righteousness.
      Those who are saved in the kingdom of God will have nothing of which
      to boast in themselves; the praise and the glory will all flow back to God,
      the giver of salvation.”—Ellen G. White, The Youth’s Instructor, Dec.
      6, 1894. Notice the imagery: a robe of righteousness, a spotless robe of
      righteousness, “woven in the loom of heaven” and with not a thread of
      sinful humanity stitched in anywhere. What a wonderful image of the
      righteousness of Jesus, the righteousness that covers anyone and every-
      one who will be saved into His kingdom at last.

     Staring in the Mirror
        It’s a sad fact: not all Christians, or those professing Christ, have
     lived up to the high standards that their faith calls them 10. This is a
     truth revealed, not just in the fall of some famous mega-evangelist or
     TV preacher but among all Christians.
        Who hasn’t been greatly disappointed in the actions of someone
     whom they looked up to as a role model? As they’ve gotten to know
     some “good” Christian really well, who hasn’t seen faults and flaws
     that they never knew existed? Some who profess the name of Jesus
     do better than others, or at least appear to before others, but we all
     fall short.
        What Christian, looking in the mirror, stares in the face of someone
     who is perfectly reflecting the character of Jesus? What Christian,
     no matter how faithful, staring in the mirror, can claim any kind of
     righteousness for himself or for herself? What Christian, staring in
     the mirror, isn’t horrified by what he or she knows lurks beneath the
     surface?

Read Isaiah 64. What message is being proclaimed there? What
     garment imagery is used to describe human righteousness, and
     what does it mean? What hope is presented in the chapter, as
     well?

        The phrase “filthy rags” means a garment defiled by menstruation.
     What more powerful image could the Bible give to describe human
     righteousness after the Fall? The apostle Paul picks up on this theme
     in Romans 3, where he makes it clear that both Jews and Gentiles
     are in the same position before God: sinners in need of divine grace.
     Isaiah 64 may be seen as an Old Testament precursor to Romans 3,
     pointing out our dilemma as sinners and yet not leaving us without
     hope.

      When was the last time you took a deep look at yourself, your
      thoughts, your innermost motives, and your desires? What did
      you see? How scary was it? What is your only hope?

     Imputed Righteousness
        No question, any honest Christian looking at himself or herself,
     particularly in contrast to the righteousness of God, especially as
     revealed through Christ, will see something pretty scary. Not much
     there to commend oneself toward God, is there? In fact, there’s noth-
     ing at all, nothing but “filthy rags.”
        What hope, then, do we have? A great hope, actually, and the
     theological term for that hope is imputed righteousness. What does
     it mean? Very simply, it’s the perfect righteousness of Jesus, the
     righteousness that was “woven in the loom of heaven” and granted
     to us by faith. “Imputed righteousness” means the substitution of His
     sinless life for our sinful life. It is credited to us, outside of us, and
     it covers us completely. We are viewed in God’s eyes as if we have
     never sinned, as if we have always been completely obedient to God’s
     commands, as if we were as holy and righteous as Jesus Himself.

Read Romans 4:1–7. How does Abraham’s trust in God illustrate
     imputed righteousness?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Paul said in Romans 4:2 that if Abraham were justified by works,
     he could have boasted. However, Abraham believed God, and there-
     fore, he was accounted righteous. Jesus invites us to come to Him in
     simple belief, sinners though we are, and He will provide His robe of
     perfection, the perfect righteousness that He wrought out in His life
     while here in the flesh. That’s known as imputed righteousness, and
     it’s the only solution to the dilemma so graphically depicted in Isaiah
     64 and Romans 3.
        Imagine it like this: Jesus strips away your old stained garments,
     your filthy rags, and wraps you in the robe of His perfect righteous-
     ness, His perfect holiness, His perfect record of law-keeping. He
     wraps you in it and then whispers in your ear, “Now you are perfect.
     I have given you My perfection. Please wear this robe, and don’t let
     it slip away from you.”

      What is the greatest gift anyone ever gave you? How did the gift
      make you feel, especially if you didn’t do anything to deserve
      it? How much more grateful should we be, then, for the gift of
      righteousness that Jesus offers us?

      Without the Law
         A preacher stood before a congregation and declared, “Jesus Christ
      has changed my life. I am a radically new and different person than
      I was before.
         “However, after 25 years of being a Christian, if there is one truth
      that my experience has taught me—an experience judged and tested
      by the Word of God—it is this: if, in the end, I am to be saved, if I
      do indeed ‘endure to the end,’ as Jesus said, and I make it into God’s
      eternal kingdom, then there isn’t a doubt in my mind that it will be
      only because I am covered in the robe of Christ’s righteousness, a
      righteousness that is woven in the loom of heaven and that covers me
      completely. I can overcome sin, and through the grace of God I have
      had many victories; I can overcome character defects, and through the
      grace of God I have; I can learn to love all sorts of people, even my
      enemies, and through the grace of God I am learning 10.
         “All that being said, I know that none of that is anywhere near
      good enough. Unless I am covered by the righteousness of Jesus, a
      righteousness credited to me by faith, apart from my obedience to the
      law, then at the end of the thousand years, you can stand on the wall of
      the holy city and wave down to me, because I know I won’t be there
      with you. I can’t be there with you.”

Read Romans 3:21–31. What is Paul saying here, and how are the ideas
      presented in these verses reflected in what the preacher above said?

         Though Paul was addressing a specific group with a specific issue,
      his point is relevant to everyone, Jews and Gentiles. Today, for us
      as Seventh-day Adventists who believe in the perpetuity of the law,
      it’s especially important. The righteousness that saves us, the righ-
      teousness that we as sinners need covering us like a garment, is a
      righteousness that has been made manifest “without the law.” In other
      words, it’s the righteousness of Jesus, the righteousness of His life,
      the righteousness that brings us “the redemption that is Christ Jesus.”
      The redemption is in Him, it is found in Him, not in ourselves or in
      our law-keeping, and this redemption becomes ours by faith.
         		
        What has been your experience with law-keeping? Have you ever
        sensed that your best efforts at obedience were making you right

     Clothes Make the Man
        An author wrote a short story about two small-time crooks trying to
     pull off a robbery. In the plan, one of the crooks was to dress up in a
     policeman’s uniform and stand in front of the place to be robbed. That
     way, with him there, no one would be suspicious while his partner
     pulled off the heist itself. The story ended, however, with the partner
     dressed as a policeman apprehending and arresting the other one.
     Dressed as a cop, he started to act like one!
        This story makes a point relevant to our topic. Yes, by faith we are
     covered in the righteousness of Christ, His “robe of righteousness” as
     it is called. We now are born again and have a new life in Christ. No
     question, then, that our lives will reflect the garment that we wear.
        In receiving Christ’s robe of righteousness, we have made a 100 per-
     cent commitment to let Him work His attributes of character into our
     lives. We are justified by grace, the work of a moment, and also have
     been given a power to obey that is assimilated over time and described
     as the work of a lifetime. Why would we ask for more? “I can do
     all things through Christ who strengthens me” (Phil. 4:13, NKJV).
     Certainly that would mean, if nothing else, the power to obey His law.

Read Romans 6:1–13. What do these texts say about what kind of
     life we are to live, now that we are covered, “clothed,” by the
     righteousness of Jesus?

        Paul is very clear here about the radical, life-changing impact that
     will happen to someone who has “been crucified” with Jesus. Notice the
     life-and-death imagery here; there’s nothing halfway. Our old person, the
     person in those filthy rags, has died; a new person is born, one clothed in
     the righteousness of Jesus, a righteousness that is made manifest so that
     we can now “walk in the newness of life.” This newness means that we
     are no longer to let sin reign in us. We have been given many promises
     of victory; the question is, Will we claim them for ourselves?

      What aspects of your life reveal the reality of your experience
      with God? What areas are you struggling in? How can you
      make the choice daily to die to self and live the new life in Christ
      that is offered us?

      Cheap Grace and Legalism
         All through the Bible, the inspired writers emphasize the need for
      obedience. To think that it doesn’t matter what we do as long as Christ
      lives in our hearts is a fallacy. If Christ truly lives in our hearts, good
      actions must, inevitably, follow. At the same time, it’s no less fatal to
      think that we can be saved by our own works of obedience.
         Paul wrote a very impressive list of his life, accomplishments, and
      pedigree before he met Jesus: he was circumcised on the eighth day,
      he was a descendant of Israel, he was a Pharisee, he had zeal, and he
      said he was faultless. Talk about legalism. After his conversion, he
      called these things rubbish compared to knowing Christ. He gained
      righteousness by accepting the robe of Christ’s righteousness, and he
      wanted to become like Him.

Read Philippians 3:3–16. How is Paul expressing the great truth of sal-
      vation by faith and what it means in the life of the one saved?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         We must keep distinct, theologically, the imputed righteousness of
      Christ—the righteousness that justifies us—from the work that the
      Holy Spirit does in us to change us. We never must separate them in
      the context of what it means to be a Christian. We must have both. To
      have the first without the second is like having a coin with only one
      side. It doesn’t exist.
         The understanding that obedience comes as a gift keeps us out of
      two ditches: cheap grace and legalism. First, we will believe in the
      importance of obeying, and second, our obedience will not be merito-
      rious because we will have received it as a gift. We are just as depen-
      dent upon Christ to obey the law and to be sanctified as we are on Him
      to be justified and forgiven before God. God is more than willing—
      He’s eager not only to justify us but to give us the victory over sin and
      self. As always, the wild card remains our will: how willing are we to
      make the daily surrender of self to Him so that we “know Christ and
      the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his suf-
      ferings, becoming like him in his death”? (Phil. 3:10, NIV).

       Read over the texts again for today. Where do you see the real-
       ity of human free will? What does Paul mean in verse 16 when
       he says “let us live up to what we have already attained”? (NIV).
       What choices can you make that will allow you to do just that?
                                                                             11

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Testing Process,”
         pp. 88, 89, in Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4; “Righteousness
         by Faith,” p. 161, in Gospel Workers; “Faith and Acceptance,”
         pp. 49–55, in Steps to Christ.

            “The law requires righteousness,—a righteous life, a perfect char-
         acter; and this man has not to give. He cannot meet the claims of
         God’s holy law. But Christ, coming to the earth as man, lived a holy
         life, and developed a perfect character. These He offers as a free gift
         to all who will receive them. His life stands for the life of men. Thus
         they have remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of
1        God. More than this, Christ imbues men with the attributes of God.
         He builds up the human character after the similitude of the divine
         character, a goodly fabric of spiritual strength and beauty. Thus the
         very righteousness of the law is fulfilled in the believer in Christ. God
         can ‘be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.’ Rom.
         3:26.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 762.

          out a paraphrase of what she is saying, and bring it to class on
          Sabbath. Listen to each other’s versions, and share your own.
          What main points come through?

          l
          2 In class, discuss your answer to Tuesday’s final question.


          l3 When we put on the robe of Christ’s righteousness, we
          “who . . . reflect the Lord’s glory, are being transformed into
          his likeness with ever-increasing glory” (see 2 Cor. 3:18, NIV).
          Describe what reflecting the Lord’s glory means.

          l
          4 Over the years, some church members have struggled with
          the question of assurance of salvation. How are we to understand
          what it means to have assurance? Where is that assurance to be
          found? How does the imagery of a robe of righteousness woven
          “in the loom of heaven” without a thread of human devising help
          us understand where our assurance can come from? How can we
          know we’re not being presumptuous if we have that assurance?

          l5 Why is it so important to maintain a theological distinction
          between what Christ has done for us, in that He justifies and
          forgives us the moment we claim it by faith, and what He works
          out in us over our lifetime? What dangers arise if we don’t keep
          that distinction sharp?

No More Devil Sticks
   Simon lives in Burundi in eastern Africa. He met a witch doctor who
convinced him that he could have great powers. Simon put away his Bible
and followed the witch doctor. He pounded sticks into the ground around
his house to protect his family from evil spirits.
   About this time Simon’s friend Samuel attended some evangelistic
meetings held by Seventh-dayAdventists. He became convinced that he
was hearing the truth and surrendered his life to Christ.
   Samuel visited Simon and shared what he had learned at the meetings.
He urged Simon to leave his witchcraft and follow Christ, but Simon
refused. Samuel continued visiting his friend and sharing his faith. One
day Samuel asked Simon, “What will be your future if you don’t turn your
life over to Christ?” Samuel’s words pierced Simon’s heart, but still he
refused to leave his witchcraft.
   On one visit Simon told Samuel that he must never eat sweet potatoes or
peanuts that have been baked in a fire or he would die. Samuel answered,
“I will eat those foods, and God will protect me.”
   Samuel went home and prayed that God would protect him as he
showed his friend that God was stronger than the spirits. Then he returned
to Simon carrying the forbidden foods. He put the food into Simon’s
cooking fire. The men talked as the sweet potatoes and peanuts roasted.
Then Samuel pulled them from the fire and ate them. He didn’t die; he
didn’t even look sick. Samuel told his friend, “You have seen for yourself
that God is more powerful than the devils in which you trust.”
   That night Simon couldn’t sleep. He found the Bible he had discarded
and opened it at random to Hosea 4:12. There he read, “ ‘They consult
a wooden idol and are answered by a stick of wood. A spirit of prostitu-
tion leads them astray; they are unfaithful to their God’ ” (NIV). Simon
trembled as he read God’s words.
   When Samuel returned, Simon told him, “I no longer trust in the sticks
that surround my house. Please help me remove them.” Samuel prayed,
and the men removed the sticks. Then Simon accepted Samuel’s invita-
tion to worship with him on Sabbath. Simon and his wife attended the
Adventist church that Sabbath and gave their hearts to God.
   “We praise God for patiently calling us to follow Him,” Simon says.
“Now we invite others to come and learn this wonderful truth that Samuel
shared with us.”
   Our mission offerings help support the work of lay evangelists and
Global Mission workers such as Samuel and Simon in dozens of countries
around the world.
Samuel Bazikwankana and Simon Bicuro are lay workers in eastern Burundi.

      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: John 1:1–3; Col. 1:16,
      17; Ezek. 28:12–19; Deut. 8:1–18; Isa. 14:12–14; 2 Cor. 11:14.

Memory Text: “Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that
      thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee” (Ezekiel 28:15).



      T
              oday’s memory text has to be one of the most profound in all
              revelation. Two crucial words stand out: perfect and iniquity,
              with the latter (iniquity) encapsulated by the former (perfect).
      What this means is that contained in the idea of being perfect, of having
      perfection—even in heaven!—is the potential for iniquity. How could
      iniquity be found in a being created “perfect” unless perfection allowed
      for it? Iniquity could not arise in a being created perfect unless being
      “perfect” included the possibility of it, which it obviously did.
         What this text shows is that, in God’s universe, the concept of
      “perfect” includes freedom, moral freedom, the ability to choose right
      and wrong. How could it not and humans still be moral and free? A
      company might be able to program software that blocks employees
      from accessing Internet pornography or gambling or other immoral
      sites, yet no one would call the software itself “moral” or “free.”
          What we have, then, is a being, Lucifer, so highly exalted that even
      his garments, his covering, are given special notice in Scripture, yet
      he abuses the freedom given him and falls away from the Lord.
         What can we learn from his tragic mistake?

     The Creator of All That’s Been Made
       Our God is the Creator. John 1:1–3 makes it clear that anything that
     was created, that is, anything that once didn’t exist but then existed,
     did so only through the action of the Lord.

Someone once asked the question, “Why is there something
     instead of nothing?” It is perhaps the most basic of all questions
     that ever could be asked. Read John 1:1–3. How does it answer
     that question?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       This idea is interesting, too, in light of what is known as the big
     bang theory, which teaches that our universe, instead of being eternal,
     as many believed through the millennia, actually came into existence
     billions of years ago. Whether the theory turns out to be true or false,
     many have seen it as evidence for a God, a Creator, because a lot of
     science, a lot of physics, and a lot of math equations were needed
     for the big bang to have occurred. And, as one scientist asked, “Who
     breathed fire into the equations?”
       We know the answer, don’t we?
       Scientists now speculate, too, that there are vast sections of the
     universe that we cannot see, which are filled with what is called dark
     matter and dark energy. What this should tell us, if nothing else, is that
     we are very limited in our view of what’s really out there.

Read Colossians 1:16, 17. What else—and who else—has God cre-
     ated that, for the most part, are beyond what we can see every
     day? What lessons should we draw from this about how humble
     we need to be regarding our knowledge of reality?

      Notice, too, in those verses that not only were all these things
      created by God, they also were created “for Him.” What might
      that mean? How can we understand that? What should it mean
      for us to know that we, too, were created “for Him”?


                                                                            15

     A Beautiful and Perfect Being
       Among what was created by God, among what once didn’t exist
     but then came into existence, was the angelic host. Chief among the
     host was the created being known as Lucifer, whose fall is recounted
     in Ezekiel 28 in the figure of the king of Tyre.

Read Ezekiel 28:12–19. What description is given to Lucifer? What
     kind of covering did he have, and what might that represent?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Describing Lucifer as the “son of the morning,” Isaiah 14:12
     records how God pictured him in his unfallen state. In Ezekiel 28:12
     God described him as “thou sealest up the sum”; the word sum could
     be translated as “pattern” or “You set a seal to your completeness.”
     —The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 675.
        Lucifer also carried the description of “day star” or “shining one”
     (Isa. 14:12, ASV and NLT). In Hebrew, htlel (shining one) and its
     equivalents in related languages commonly were applied to the planet
     Venus when it appeared in unrivaled brilliance as the morning star.
        Imagine wearing a garment, a covering, made perhaps of rubies,
     diamonds, topaz, beryl, onyx, jasper, sapphire, emerald, chrysolite,
     and turquoise mounted on gold. Even though we might attempt to
     visualize the colors of Lucifer’s covering (red, yellow, green, azure
     blue, turquoise, olive green), our earthly vision of the heavenly jewels
     and the majestic colors never would allow us to admire the robe as
     the angels could. As a heavenly being adorned in such splendor and
     with the highest position among them, Lucifer must surely have had
     the respect and affection of all the other angels.
        The angels desired to do as they were bidden. They reflected the beauty
     of their Creator and praised Him for their privilege of living in a paradise
     of celestial harmony. Their constant praise for their Maker inspired an
     unselfish love for each other, and, as long as this was their only desire,
     they lived in a constant, unequaled, and loving environment.
        In this heavenly environment, harmony, perfection, love, and
     adoration reigned—a picture that we, as human beings, can barely
     imagine.

      How could we imitate the heavenly environment with harmony,
      perfection, and love in our homes, workplaces, and churches?
      Discuss specific ways our earthly existence could better reflect
      our God’s glory and His love.

     The Fall of a Perfect Being
        				
        However hard it might be for us, with our limited view of reality, to
     envision it, Lucifer must have been an incredible-looking being. Look
     at the description of him again in Ezekiel 28: wise, beautiful, dressed
     in all these majestic stones. He must have been something!
        If we look carefully at Ezekiel 28:13, we can notice an interest-
     ing point. After talking about all these precious jewels that were his
     covering, the text says, “ ‘ “on the day you were created they were
     prepared” ’ ” (NIV). Lucifer’s coverings, his garments, as they were,
     simply reflected his exalted position. As we’ll see throughout this
     quarter, garments can reveal a great deal about our station and posi-
     tion. Thus, if garments hint at anything, it was that Lucifer was an
     exalted and lovely being, one with power and influence.

Read Ezekiel 28:17. According to this text, what helped bring
     Lucifer’s downfall? What important message should we take
     from this for ourselves?

       The irony in all this is that however wonderful Lucifer’s coverings,
     however beautiful his person, however wise he was, where did it all
     come from? Of course, whatever Lucifer had, whatever he achieved,
     whatever the wonderful garment that covered him, it all was from
     God. Again, we are dealing with a created being: his covering, his
     beauty, and his wisdom were all gifts from God. Without the Lord, he
     would have had nothing and been nothing.
       And yet, somehow, a being who lived closest to God forgot that
     important point.

Read Deuteronomy 8:1–18. What principle is found here that is
     reflected in what happened to Lucifer?

      How easy, especially in times of prosperity and wealth, to forget
      just how dependent we are upon the Lord for everything. What
      daily and practical things can we do to help us keep from falling
      into the trap of looking at our “beautiful garments”—our wis-
      dom, our success, our prosperity, in whatever form these come—
      and forgetting just how dependent we are on the Lord for it all?

     Wanting to Be God
        		
        “ ‘ “You were on the holy mount of God; you walked among the
     fiery stones” ’ ” (Ezek. 28:14, NIV).

        Ezekiel used a figure of speech that represents the placement of
     God’s government or heaven itself. When Ezekiel described Lucifer
     on the mountain of God, his words showed the high position that
     God gave to this created being and the privileges that were granted
     him. Other instances in the Bible indicate that a mountain experience
     was of great meaning. For instance, Moses ascended a mountain to
     meet God (Exod. 19:20), and Jesus and three of the disciples met on
     a high mountain where Jesus experienced the Transfiguration (Matt.
     17:1, 2).
        In “Thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of
     fire” (Ezek. 28:14), again the prophet Ezekiel uses symbolism to
     indicate the presence of God: “stones of fire.” The Lord appeared to
     Moses, Aaron, and the other leaders in this way: “And they saw the
     God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of
     a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness”
     (Exod. 24:10).
        In spite of all of Lucifer’s privileges, he allowed the wrong thoughts
     to enter and to fester in his mind, thoughts that eventually led to
     actions and to his rebellion and ruin.

Read Isaiah 14:12–14, another depiction of Lucifer’s fall. What
     principles are in play here, and what can we learn from them for
     ourselves amid our own temptations and struggles?

     ________________________________________________________

       The ancient Romans often believed that when an emperor died, he
     became a deity, which explains Vespasian’s dying words, “Oh, my, I
     think I’m becoming a god.”
       The temptation to play God can be more subtle than most of us
     realize. When we judge people’s motives, when we take for ourselves
     prerogatives that don’t belong to us, when we seek to control others
     in ways that are inappropriate—are we not, in our own way, seeking
     to play God?

      Dwell more on the subtle ways we all might be in danger of
      seeking to put ourselves in the role of God. How might you have
      done the same thing? What is, really, the only cure for this dan-
      gerous but often subtle deception?

      Satan on Earth
         “No wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of
      light” (2 Cor. 11:14, NASB).

        As we all know so well, Satan’s fall didn’t impact only heaven but
      affected earth, as well, and his fall and rebellion in heaven are mani-
      fested here on earth in what we call the great controversy. It’s real, it’s
      bitter, and it involves all of us.

Read Revelation 12:7–12. What is this passage talking about, and
      what caution—and at the same time, hope—can we take from
      these verses?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Fortunately, because of the Cross, because of what Jesus completed
      for us there, we know how it will turn out in the end. Victory is assured
      for all who are covered in the robes of Christ’s perfection. Hence, Satan
      works diligently to try to keep as many as possible from finding the sav-
      ing righteousness that guarantees them a place in eternity.

Read 2 Corinthians 11:14 again, paying close attention to the context
      in which Paul is writing. What important message should we take
      from this passage for ourselves?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         Satan works in various ways to deceive us, to turn us from a saving
      relationship with Christ, and he’s not averse to using other professed
      Christians to do just that. Indeed, that often can be his most effective
      ploy.
         Spiritual danger lurks all around us (1 Pet. 5:8). The important thing
      for all of us to remember, however, is that we’re dealing with a defeated
      foe: the devil has lost, his ruin is sure, and his reign will end. Yet, in and
      of ourselves we cannot fight him and win. Our only hope and strength are
      found in the One who has defeated him already, and that is Jesus. His vic-
      tory is ours, as long as we claim it for ourselves in faith and obedience.

       What are the subtle ways the devil can slowly but surely, step-by-
       step, undermine our faith if we are not careful? What day-by-day
       choices can we make to ensure that he doesn’t succeed?
                                                                                19

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Why Was Sin Permitted?”
         pp. 35–43, “The Tabernacle and Its Services,” p. 349, in Patriarchs
         and Prophets; “The Light of Life,” p. 464, in The Desire of Ages.
         Read also The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, pp. 675, 676.

            “When Satan seeks to cover the people of God with blackness, and
         ruin them, Christ interposes. Although they have sinned, Christ has
         taken the guilt of their sins upon His own soul.”—Ellen G. White,
         Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 169.
            “Sin entered the world by the defection of one who stood at the
1
         head of the holy angels. What was it that wrought so great a change,
         transforming a royal, honored subject into an apostate? The answer
         is given, ‘Thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty; thou hast
         corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness.’ Had not the Lord
         made the covering cherub so beautiful, so closely resembling his own
         image; had not God awarded him special honor; had anything been
2
         left undone in the gift of beauty and power and honor, then Satan
         might have had some excuse.”—Ellen G. White, General Conference
         Daily Bulletin, March 2, 1897.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Dwell more on the idea of morality and freedom. Can there be
          true morality apart from freedom? Are actions that are deemed
3         moral really moral if they are forced, if they don’t come from
          free choice? Discuss.

          l
          2 No matter how much Satan had, it wasn’t enough. In what
          ways do we find ourselves manifesting that same attitude? How
          can we stop ourselves from following down this ruinous path?

          l
          3 In class, read over Revelation 12:7–12 and discuss what those
          texts mean in light of how we are to live, particularly verse 11:
          “And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the
          word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the
          death.”

          l
          4 Dwell more on the idea of how we can make ourselves out to be
          God. What does it mean? How might this trait be manifested in
          our lives without our even realizing it?

          l5 Read again the first Ellen G. White quote above, about Christ
          taking our guilt upon Himself. What exactly does that mean?
          What hope can we take from that promise for ourselves? What
          will happen to those who refuse to believe that this promise is
          applied to them personally?

Nagging Questions
by Daniel Safciu
   I grew up in Romania during Communist times. My parents were
Seventh-day Adventists, and they risked everything to teach us about their
faith and model Christian behavior. But in spite of their efforts and
prayers, I chose to believe evolution rather than the faith my parents had
taught me.
   I lost my faith in God and stopped attending church, stopped obeying
the Ten Commandments, and stopped keeping the Sabbath. I declared
myself an atheist, which broke my mother’s heart. I was uncomfort-
able being the only unbeliever in my home, so I left home and set out to
escape from Romania. I slipped across the border in hopes of escaping
the Communist world, but I failed repeatedly; and each time I tried, I was
sentenced to time in prison.
   Later I was caught stealing cars and was sent to prison again. There I
met a doctor who was a political prisoner. I told him I didn’t believe in
God, and he said, “Why? Even Einstein believed in God.” I wondered, Is
this man right? Does God really exist after all? I began to wonder how
such scientific phenomena as gravity and electromagnetic force could
exist unless Someone created them. I prayed, “God, if You exist, help me
believe.” About this time, Communism fell in Romania.
   Without warning I was sent to another prison. Two days after I
arrived, a guard asked me, “Do you want to attend a small meeting for
Christians?” I went, and to my surprise I recognized people I had known
from the Adventist church during my childhood. One was my cousin. He
gave me some books to read. One was on creationism and science. I read
them and found answers to my questions. I continued attending the small
group, and I felt God changing my life. I surrendered my life to Christ and
was baptized after I was released from prison.
   I joined a group who ministers to prisoners because I understood their
situation and their needs. Today I work with former prisoners, helping
them adjust to society, find housing and work, and make something of
themselves. I’m raising funds to set up a book bindery and other voca-
tional training programs for ex-convicts.
   God has brought me full circle. I knew the truth but let it go; then I
struggled with disbelief until I was willing to listen to God’s voice again.
Now I am helping others who’ve walked the same path as I have.
   Your mission offerings are helping so many people find new meaning
in life. I’m one of them.

Daniel Safciu is a carpenter. Originally from Romania, he now lives in Belgium.

      A Garment of Innocence




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: 2 Tim. 3:16, 17; Luke
      21:36; Gen. 2:20–25; 2:15–17; 3:6–11, 21.

Memory Text: “So God created man in his own image, in the
      image of God created he him; male and female created he them”
      (Genesis 1:27).



      A
               s we have studied, Lucifer’s fall wasn’t limited to heaven. He
               has brought his wiles and deceptions to earth, as well. What’s
               amazing, too, is how successfully he has perverted the most
      obvious truths of God’s Word and has made millions believe the
      opposite of those truths.
         For instance, Genesis is so clear: humans started out at the top of the
      earthly “food chain.” They were created, immediately, in the “image
      of God.” This image wasn’t something that evolved over billions of
      years from natural processes. Evolution teaches the opposite—that
      humans started out at a lower level (as microbes) and eventually,
      through a brutal process of violence and death, clawed their way up
      the food chain. Scripture, in contrast, teaches that humans started
      out at the top, in the image of God, and through sin began a steady
      descent.
         This week, with some garment imagery that appears in Genesis,
      we’ll take a look at how that descent began and what the only solu-
      tion is.

     The First Days
Skim through the first two chapters of Genesis. Try to imagine what
     this earth, fresh from the hand of the Creator, must have been
     like, a world untainted by sin. In what overt ways does our world
     today differ from what it was like back then?

     _______________________________________________________

       Adam and Eve were put in an environment beyond our wildest
     imaginations—a stunning home in a gorgeous garden with animals
     and other creatures as loyal friends. They reveled in the spectacular
     scenery, the scented flowers, the birds, and the animals, and in God’s
     love and in their love for each other. They neither wanted nor needed
     anything more, and they tended the Garden as they were bidden by
     their Maker. Adam and Eve surely looked forward to their Master’s
     visits as they strolled together in the Garden and actively communi-
     cated with Him. They knew that He loved them, and in return, their
     love for Him increased each day.

Adam’ and Eve’s connection with their Maker and their Master
     developed and grew through these cherished daily contacts, in a
     world that didn’t know sin and the decay and devastation that
     sin always brings. How might we have a similar relationship with
     our Creator, but now in a world long corrupted by sin? See 2 Tim.
     3:16, 17; Luke 21:36; Matt. 6:25–34; John 17:3.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       Adam and Eve held open-faced communion with the Lord, a
     privilege that we don’t have now. However, we do have the privilege
     of living our lives in constant connection with the same God as did
     Adam and Eve. Sure, sin has gotten in the way. But through Jesus,
     who has connected heaven to earth with bonds that never can be bro-
     ken, a way has been paved for us to live as closely and intimately with
     our Creator as is possible now.

      How intimately and closely do you walk with God? As you mull
      over your answer, ask yourself, What things am I doing that
      strengthen that intimacy, and what things break it? What choices
      must you make if you want a closer walk with your Lord?

                                                                        23

     Naked but Not Ashamed
       It’s very hard for us—whose concepts of the world, of reality, of
     everything, actually, are filtered and tainted and distorted by sin—to
     imagine fully the moral condition of Adam and Eve in Eden. These
     were people who knew no pain, no suffering, no deception, no
     betrayal, no death, no loss, and no shame, especially sexual shame
     (which is perhaps the most prevalent kind in a world so steeped in the
     consequences of sin today).

Read Genesis 2:20–25. What kind of close relationship and intimacy
     between Adam and Eve is revealed in these texts?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       As “one flesh” (see Gen. 2:24), Adam and Eve were close then, not
     only to God but to each other. The text is very clear, very unambigu-
     ous: they were naked and not ashamed (vs. 25). Talk about purity and
     innocence!
       “The sinless pair wore no artificial garments; they were clothed
     with a covering of light and glory, such as the angels wear. So long
     as they lived in obedience to God, this robe of light continued to
     enshroud them.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 45.
       Exactly what this light looked like, how it functioned, what its
     purpose was, we aren’t told. Only that, even with it, they still were
     deemed “naked.” The fact that they weren’t ashamed must have
     meant that this covering of light didn’t completely hide their naked-
     ness, but in that sinless environment it didn’t matter, for no shame
     existed.
       In a sense, the emphasis on nakedness seems to reveal the kind of
     physical closeness the sinless couple enjoyed. There was an open-
     ness, a transparency, an innocence about them and all that they did
     that allowed for this state of affairs. They lived in complete honesty,
     openness, and freedom before each other and before God. It was,
     after all, how the Lord had ordained it. How nice it must have
     been.

      How much openness and transparency exist in your own life?
      Or are you constantly hiding things, cutting moral corners,
      cloaking yourself in coverings that don’t reveal what’s really
      going on? (See Matt. 10:26.) If the latter, what aspects of your
      life must you start to change?

     The Test
        Last week’s lesson talked about a crucial truth: the freedom that
     God allows all His moral beings. Again, without that freedom, they
     might be able to do moral things, in the same way that a house alarm
     that protects people from crime does something “moral,” yet who
     would call the alarm itself moral? In the same way, beings who have
     no choice but to do the right thing aren’t moral either. Only free
     beings can be moral ones.
        A simple test was given to Adam and Eve, to see whether they
     would—in their freedom—obey the Lord. It was, in a sense, a time of
     probation for these free creatures. Freedom means just that, freedom,
     and they had to prove that they would do the right thing with the
     freedom given them.

Read Genesis 2:15–17, the probationary test given to Adam (and,
     eventually, Eve). Think about the environment in which this test
     was given. Why did that environment make their transgression
     that much more egregious?
     ________________________________________________________

Read Genesis 3:1–4. Look carefully at what Satan said to Eve. What
     unfortunate truth did he mix in with all his lies?
     ________________________________________________________
     ________________________________________________________

       It’s interesting that the tree was of both “good and evil.” God,
     obviously, didn’t want to keep Adam and Eve from good. Indeed, the
     whole world God had created, including them, was good, even “very
     good” (Gen. 1:31). It was from the knowledge of evil that the Lord
     wanted to spare them.
       Which is not hard to understand, is it? Even in our fallen world,
     what parent doesn’t want to protect his or her children from the
     knowledge of evil? How much more so, then, did God want to protect
     Adam and Eve from evil, from the knowledge of the one thing that
     would cause them to lose their garments of light and to know shame,
     suffering, and death?

      Evil doesn’t always come in blatant manifestations, which are
      so easy to see and detect and, often, avoid (after all, how many
      people are serial killers and the like?). There are, however,
      very subtle manifestations of evil. What might these be? How
      can we learn to identify these forms of evil and then to protect
      ourselves from them?
                                                                      25

     A New Set of Clothes
       As we know all too well, Adam and Eve failed their test, even one
     as simple as that. To call the results tragic would, of course, be the
     greatest understatement in human history. Tragic hardly conveys the
     horrible results of our first parents’ disobedience.

Read Genesis 3:6 –11. What was the first thing that happened to
     Adam and Eve (which is exactly what Satan, in verse 5, said
     would happen) after they fell, and what does that mean? What
     did it imply the results of their transgression were?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       Their eyes were opened, just as Satan said they would be, only
     now they were seeing the world and reality differently than they ever
     had before. All through those verses, the theme of their nakedness
     reoccurs. It’s the controlling motif in the section. Their fall from
     innocence, their transgression, and their new relationship to God and
     to each other are all expressed in the theme of their now knowing that
     they are naked.
       Notice, too, the Lord’s question to them: “ ‘Who told you that you
     were naked?’ ” (vs. 11, NIV). It implies that in their innocence they
     never realized their nakedness, that it just seemed a natural way to be,
     and so they didn’t give it any thought. Now, though, not only did they
     think about it, they were dominated by the shame that it brought.

What is the significance of Adam and Eve’s response to their naked-
     ness?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Imagine Adam and Eve hiding behind some bushes, looking at
     themselves with mouths agape and attempting to cover themselves
     before the Lord. Looking at the possibilities for coverings, they must
     have decided that the fig leaves were the best. Thus, here we have
     the first lesson in salvation by works, in humans attempting to solve
     the problem of sin by their own works and deeds. As pathetic as their
     attempts were then, they are no more so than ours are today.

Animal Skin
  “And the Lord God made for Adam and for his wife garments
of skins, and clothed them” (Gen. 3:21, RSV).

   Yesterday we saw Adam’s and Eve’s response to their sin; today
we’ll look at God’s. In the above text, we have, in a sense, the gospel
message prefigured.
   First, we can see that Adam’s and Eve’s fig-leaf covering was not
adequate. If it were, there would have been no need to kill innocent
animals in order to clothe the fallen couple. In the same way, all our
efforts to keep the law well enough to be saved are inadequate. If
working our way to salvation were adequate, Christ would not have
had to die for us. Just as fig leaves would have been less costly and
traumatic than the death of innocent animals, so, too, our works would
have been cheaper than the death of Jesus. In both cases, our works,
fig leaves, couldn’t suffice; that’s why Jesus had to die for us; that’s
why innocent animals needed to be slain. It could be no other way
(Gal. 3:21, Rom. 3:21–28).
   Second, what’s the main difference between fig leaves and animal
skins? What inevitably comes from the latter that doesn’t from the
former? Of course, the answer is blood. That alone should tell us how
the gospel appears in Genesis 3:21 (see Lev. 17:11; Rev. 12:11; 1 Pet.
1:18, 19; Heb. 9:22).
   Third, perhaps the most insightful part of the text is the last part, in
which it says that “[He] clothed them” (Gen. 3:21). The Hebrew is
clear: it was the Lord who placed the animal skins on Adam and Eve. It
was His act, it was what He did for them that covered the shame of their
nakedness. As we saw yesterday, the immediate consequences of their
sin were revealed in the nakedness motif; now, however, God Himself
solves the problem by clothing them Himself, in a covering made from
innocent animals who were slain. The text says only that a “skin” cov-
ered them; it doesn’t tell us what kind. It might not be hard to make a
correct guess, though, would it? (See Gen. 22:8, John 1:36, 3:16.)
   Thus, right from the start, the Lord revealed the plan of salvation.
However horrible Adam’s and Eve’s sin, it wasn’t greater than God’s
grace to save them from it, a point we should never forget ourselves.

 Dwell on the wonderful promise of salvation by faith in Jesus.
 Dwell on the promise that our salvation is found in what He
 has done for us and not in what we can ever do for ourselves.
 How can we learn to make the promise of the gospel, of Christ’s
 righteousness as our own robe, the center and foundation of our
 lives and our walk with the Lord?

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Creation,” “The Tempt-
         ation and Fall,” and “The Plan of Redemption,” pp. 44 –70, in
         Patriarchs and Prophets.

           “The white robe of innocence was worn by our first parents when
         they were placed by God in holy Eden. . . . Nothing can man devise to
         supply the place of his lost robe of innocence. . . . Only the covering
         which Christ Himself has provided can make us meet to appear in God’s
         presence. This covering, the robe of His own righteousness, Christ will
         put upon every repenting, believing soul. . . . This robe, woven in the
1        loom of heaven, has in it not one thread of human devising. Christ in
         His humanity wrought out a perfect character, and this character He
         offers to impart to us.”—Ellen G. White, Maranatha, p. 78.
           “The Lord Jesus Christ has prepared a covering, the robe of his
         own righteousness, that he will put on every repenting, believing soul
         who by faith will receive it. . . . Then when the Lord looks upon the
2        believing sinner, he sees, not the fig-leaves covering him, but his own
         robe of righteousness.”—Ellen G. White, Advent Review and Sabbath
         Herald, Nov. 15, 1898.

    Discussion Questions:
          l1 Read Genesis 3:6. What were the avenues to Eve’s soul that
          the devil was able to take advantage of in seeking to make her
          fall? How do these same things work for him today, as well?
3
          l2 Dwell more on the centrality of nakedness in the Eden nar-
          rative. What else can we take from this idea that could help us
          understand what was going on there?

          l3 Read the two Ellen G. White quotes in Friday’s study. How is
          the wonderful truth of the gospel revealed in those words?

          l4 Look at Hebrews 5:14: “But strong meat belongeth to them
          that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their
          senses exercised to discern both good and evil.” Dwell more on
          the whole question of evil. What do we mean by the term evil? Is
          it something that is always absolute and unchanging? Or is evil a
          relative term, in that what some cultures deem evil other cultures
          might deem good, or that what was once deemed evil in one cul-
          ture now no longer is? How much does culture itself influence our
          concept of what is and isn’t evil? How can we step beyond our
          culture and know for sure what is good and what is evil? How are
          we to understand Isaiah 5:20: “Woe unto them that call evil good,
          and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness;
          that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter”?

Seeing the Light
by Faustino Mendez
   Life for my family was hard. I sold bread on the streets of Veracruz,
Mexico. But I used a good portion of my income to buy cigarettes and
alcohol. Then one day a blind man stopped to buy some bread. Orestes
was friendly and invited me to his house for a drink of water. After that
he often stopped to talk to me.
   Orestes loved to talk about God, and when he invited me to study the
Bible, I agreed. My wife and I belonged to another church, and she didn’t
understand why I wanted to study the Bible with someone from another
faith. But I told her I needed to know more about God, so she agreed to
study with me.
   My sister joined us for the Bible study, and we often talked about how
our new knowledge of God was influencing our faith. But we hesitated to
make a decision to change churches. Then, suddenly, my sister died in an
automobile accident.
   My wife and I realized how unsure the future is and that we mustn’t
delay in acting on what we knew was the truth. So, when the man teaching
us the Bible invited us to church, we went. The people of the church were
friendly and kind; we felt welcome.
   Saturday had been my busiest day selling bread. I didn’t think we could
survive unless I worked on Saturday. But when I tried to sell bread on
Saturday, God didn’t bless my business. I realized that I was losing God’s
blessing by not obeying Him in this matter. I stopped selling bread and
found work that wouldn’t require me to work on Sabbath.
   I realized that smoking and drinking were wrong, and I stopped buying
cigarettes and alcohol. The money we save more than pays for our tithes
and offerings.
   I’m convinced that we’re where God wants us to be. I invite others to
church, and we have started a small group that meets in our house.
   Our church is growing, and I pray that one day soon we’ll have a church
building in which to worship and invite our friends. I want to bring my
large family—my ten brothers and sisters, their children, and many other
relatives—to God. I want them to know that His truth is for today, for
us.
   Your mission offerings helped support the work in our country, so a
blind man could show us the light of God’s love. And a recent Thirteenth
Sabbath Offering is helping to build a church in our city so others can
come to Christ, as well. Thank you!

Faustino Mendez shares his faith in Veracruz, Mexico.

      The Coat of Different
      Colors


        			
      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 29:21–30:24; 34;
      37; 42:13; 1 Cor. 9:24–26.

Memory Text: “Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his chil-
      dren, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a
      coat of many colours” (Genesis 37:3).



      T
             he seed (so to speak) for this whole story began in Genesis
             29, with Jacob and his wives and concubines. One father, four
             mothers, and about a dozen children between them: one didn’t
      need to be a prophet to know beforehand what a dysfunctional and
      dismal family this would turn out to be.
        How much better had Jacob followed the earliest archetype
      example, the one from Eden: one husband, one wife. Period. This was
      the ideal model for all homes, for all times.
        But as we have seen, God created us free beings, and that freedom
      includes the freedom to do wrong. Symbolic, perhaps, of the mistakes
      that Jacob made, the famous “coat of many colors” reveals how one
      mistake can lead to others and others, with consequences far beyond
      our control.
        How much better, then, to nip sin in the bud before it devours us
      and those we love.

     The Genesis of a Family Disaster
        Life, as we all know, doesn’t come sealed off, in distinct and sepa-
     rate categories or sections. Everything impacts just about everything.
     In fact, Einstein’s theory of general relativity teaches that all matter in
     the universe has a gravitational pull on all other matter. That is, your
     body exerts a gravitational pull not only on your neighbor but on the
     sun and everything else in the created world, as well.
        Of course, we don’t need a lesson in physics to recognize the reality
     of how the deeds and actions of one person can radically, and even
     tragically, impact others, even generations later. Who we are, where
     we are, why we are what we are—these all have been affected to some
     degree by the actions of others completely out of our control. Thus,
     we need to be careful regarding the things we say and do; for who
     knows the impact, short-term and long-term, and either for good or
     for ill, that our deeds and words will have on others?

Read Genesis 24 and 29:21–30. What kind of family is being created
     here? What lesson should this reveal to us about how following
     customs of the world, especially when they go against principles
     of truth, can lead to disaster?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        “The sin of Jacob, and the train of events to which it led, had not
     failed to exert an influence for evil—an influence that revealed its bit-
     ter fruit in the character and life of his sons. As these sons arrived at
     manhood they developed serious faults. The results of polygamy were
     manifest in the household. This terrible evil tends to dry up the very
     springs of love, and its influence weakens the most sacred ties. The
     jealousy of the several mothers had embittered the family relation, the
     children had grown up contentious and impatient of control, and the
     father’s life was darkened with anxiety and grief.”—Ellen G. White,
     Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 208, 209.

      What things have you been handed that were beyond your con-
      trol? A lot, isn’t there? Right now, think about some important
      decisions you are going to make. Ask yourself, How might these
      choices impact others, and is that what I really want to see hap-
      pen?

     Joseph and His Brothers
       Sibling rivalry, even in the most traditional of homes, can be bad
     enough. But in this mix, it turned into a festering brew, for in it were
     ingredients such as hatred and jealousy and favoritism and pride that
     led eventually to disaster.
       For starters, the brothers of Joseph weren’t exactly the sweetest lot
     of young lads, were they?

Read Genesis 34. What does this chapter tell us about the brothers’
     characters?

     ________________________________________________________

        Then, too, there was the issue of Joseph’s dreams (Gen. 37:5–11),
     in which the whole family bows in obeisance toward him. If the broth-
     ers didn’t like him beforehand, these dreams would only increase their
     dislike. In fact, that’s exactly what Genesis 37:8 says.
        But there’s more.

Read Genesis 37:2. How would this only make relations worse
     between Joseph and his brothers?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       No one likes to be tattled on, and regardless of how bad the broth-
     ers’ conduct was, they surely didn’t appreciate Joseph telling on
     them to their father. Though the text doesn’t say specifically what
     they were doing, considering their past conduct, it most likely was
     something that needed to be dealt with before they brought even more
     shame and reproach on themselves and their family.
       Finally, too, perhaps the biggest issue was that, as the Bible comes
     out and says, “Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children”
     (Gen. 37:3). The brothers weren’t stupid; they had surely picked up
     on their father’s attitude, and that could have made a bad situation
     worse.
       Hence, however inexcusable the brothers’ actions were toward
     Joseph, this background helps us better understand what led to them.

      We all, to some degree, are trapped in our circumstances. Things
      happen that are beyond our control. The questions for us always
      must be, then, How do I respond to these circumstances? Do they
      dominate me to the point that I compromise my principles, or do
      I allow my principles to guide me through my circumstances?

      The Coat of Many Colors
         The bad characters of the brothers stood out even more in contrast
      to the character of Joseph.
         “There was one, however, of a widely different character—the
      elder son of Rachel, Joseph, whose rare personal beauty seemed but
      to reflect an inward beauty of mind and heart. Pure, active, and joy-
      ous, the lad gave evidence also of moral earnestness and firmness.
      He listened to his father’s instructions, and loved to obey God. The
      qualities that afterward distinguished him in Egypt—gentleness,
      fidelity, and truthfulness—were already manifest in his daily life. His
      mother being dead, his affections clung the more closely to the father,
      and Jacob’s heart was bound up in this child of his old age. He ‘loved
      Joseph more than all his children.’ ”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and
      Prophets, p. 209.

Read Genesis 37:3, 4. How did this act by their father make the situ-
      ation worse?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         The costly coat, given to Joseph by a doting father and beauti-
      fully woven in a variety of colors, certainly was finer than any of his
      brothers’ cloaks and was a kind of garment usually worn by people
      of distinction. The brothers no doubt assumed that their father would
      bestow further honors upon this child, and that could mean that he
      would get the birthright. They could have easily read into it that
      Joseph would get the greater inheritance. Whatever the father meant
      by giving Joseph the coat—and it could simply have been a token of
      love and nothing more—it was a big mistake, for it fanned even more
      the flames of hatred in the brothers’ hearts toward Joseph.
         In a sense, the coat symbolizes earthly honors and earthly distinction—
      earthly and, therefore, temporal and superficial in the end. In writing the
      story, however, Moses placed the coat in the context of Jacob loving
      Joseph more than the other children, and thus, it was also central in the
      context of their hatred for him and what that hatred led 10.

       Have you ever been given a worldly honor? How good did you
       feel at the time? How long before the euphoria or the sense of
       satisfaction or whatever good feeling you had wore off, and the
       honor came to mean little or nothing? What lesson should you
       take from that? See 1 Cor. 9:24–26.

     The Coat Stripped
Read Genesis 37:12–25. What great contrast between good and evil
     is seen here, between innocence and treachery?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       Not only did Joseph’s brothers plot his death, they also planned in
     advance just what they would tell their father. Oh, Father. We’re so sorry.
     We found this coat. Is it Joseph’s? If so, then a ferocious animal must
     have devoured him. It’s hard to imagine how people could be so full of
     hatred toward their own brother that they could do something like this.

Read Genesis 37:23. What is significant about what happened there?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        The first thing the brothers talked about when they saw Joseph from
     afar was the dreams, which made their hatred for him grow. Now,
     once and for all, they would see what would come of those dreams.
     It’s interesting to note that the first recorded act against Joseph by
     his brothers was the stripping away of his coat. The Hebrew makes it
     clear that they were talking about the much-hated coat, the one that
     their father had made for him. The text stresses that it was “on him.”
     Along with everything else, to see him approach wearing the coat
     must have only added to their anger.
        Thus, here we can see the brothers attempting to undo all the
     things that caused them so much hatred and anger. The coat for them
     symbolized all that they hated about their brother, all the good things
     about him and the bad things about themselves. It must have been
     with a lot of joy, glee, and satisfaction that they stripped off the coat.
     Now, suddenly, without that fancy garment, which symbolized what
     they feared was Joseph’s superiority over them, Joseph was helpless
     before those who, according to his own dreams, were one day to bow
     down before him.

      Look at how irrational the brothers’ actions were as a result of
      their emotions. How often do we allow our emotions to drive us
      to do irrational things? How can we learn to keep our emotions
      under the power of God and thus spare ourselves (and often
      others) from the terrible consequences of things done in fits of
      deep emotion?

     “Thy Son’s Coat”
       “So they took Joseph’s tunic, and slaughtered a male goat and
     dipped the tunic in the blood; and they sent the varicolored tunic and
     brought it to their father and said, ‘We found this; please examine it
     to see whether it is your son’s tunic or not’ ” (Gen. 37:31, 32, NASB).

        How could they, the sons of a loving father, stoop so low as to hand
     their father the cloak he had given his son, now splashed with blood,
     and ask him to identify it? Maybe even a day before they had com-
     mitted this crime, nothing like it had entered their minds. But once we
     start on a trail of sin, who knows where it will lead?

Read Genesis 37:26–36. What is revealing about the language the
     brothers used before their father?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Notice, the brothers’ question referred not to “our brother’s coat”
     but to “your son’s coat.” The coldness, the callousness, is amazing.
     Perhaps, too, it was a kind of unconscious defense mechanism for them.
     It wasn’t “our brother’s” coat that they found but, rather, “thy son’s
     coat”—a way to limit in their own minds the evil that they had done.
        Thus, the coat had a role both in the beginning and in the end. A
     symbol of the relationship between Jacob and Joseph, it now was
     covered in blood, a symbol of Joseph’s “demise” and what they all
     assumed would be the end of Joseph and all their animosity toward
     him. No doubt, though, this act solved one problem only to bring on
     a host of others. Surely the brothers must have been pained by their
     father’s grief. Surely, day by day seeing Jacob mourn, these men must
     have struggled with guilt and remorse.

Read Genesis 42:13, 21–23, 32 and Genesis 44:28. What do these
     verses tell us about the long-lasting impact of the brothers’ deeds
     on themselves and their family?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       In the end, the Lord brought good out of the evil that the brothers
     had done, but that hardly justifies what they did. However extreme
     their actions were, this story should remind us of how quickly sins
     can get out of hand, blind us, and lead us to do things that more often
     than not lead to tragedy and suffering.
                                                                         35
                      F riday April 22

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Return to Canaan,”
         “Joseph in Egypt,” and “Joseph and His Brothers,” pp. 209–240, in
         Patriarchs and Prophets; pp. 428–432, in The SDA Bible Commentary,
         vol. 1.

           “Joseph, unsuspicious of what was to befall him, approached his
         brethren with gladness of heart to greet them after his long, weari-
         some journey. His brothers rudely repulsed him. He told them his
         errand, but they answered him not. Joseph was alarmed at their angry
         looks. . . . They accused him of hypocrisy. As they gave utterance to
         their envious feelings, Satan controlled their minds, and they had no
1        sense of pity, and no feelings of love for their brother. They stripped
         him of his coat of many colors that he wore, which was a token of his
         father’s love, and which had excited their envious feelings.”—Ellen G.
         White, The Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 1, pp. 128, 129.
           		
    Discussion Questions:
2
          l1 What other kinds of “coats of many colors” are there? What
          are things of the world that we covet, which sooner or later
          can be easily stripped from us and defiled in blood? What kind
          of worldly honors seem to mean so much and yet, in the end,
          really mean nothing at all?
          								
          l2 Think about the context of this week’s lesson and then read

3         Genesis 45:22. What irony is found there?

          l
          3 Joseph often has been seen as a type of Christ. Go through the
          Joseph story and see what parallels you can find between Christ
          and Joseph. Share your answers with your class.

          l4 There’s little doubt the brothers felt great remorse for their
          actions. We don’t know what their father did with the bloodied
          coat. Perhaps he kept it as a memento of his beloved son. Imagine
          how the brothers would have felt each time they saw this coat,
          once a symbol of their jealousy, and now a symbol of their guilt.
          How can we learn to think before we act and not to do things
          rashly? How much different this story would have been had the
          brothers known the Lord whom their father served! If the broth-
          ers knew how to pray, how to die to self, how to surrender to the
          Lord in faith and obedience, none of this would have happened,
          and so much pain and suffering could have been spared. How
          can we learn not to fall into the same trap that these men did?

A Passionate Giver
   Deok Ja (Dohk jah) watched the Christians enter the church across the
street from her home in southwestern Korea. The children were so well
behaved; she wished her daughters had such friends to play with.
   One day a woman knocked on her door and introduced herself as the
wife of the pastor of the church across the street. She offered Deok Ja a
magazine, Signs of the Times®. The pastor’s wife visited often after that,
bringing gifts of vegetables and bread. She invited Deok Ja to attend a
meeting on health, and Deok Ja went, because she wanted to know more
about healthful living. She attended worship services, and in time, she
found Jesus as her Savior and joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
   God’s love bubbled over in her life, and Deok Ja shared that love with
others. But her husband and children held the first place in her prayers.
   Her husband allowed her to worship and to teach their children about
God, but he wasn’t interested in religion. Deok Ja prayed that God would
work a miracle in her husband’s heart and bathed her prayers with kind
words and deeds.
   For ten years she prayed and shared God’s love with others, leading
many to Christ. She taught their daughters to do the same. Still her heart
ached for her husband, who told her that he would consider attending
church with her after he retired from public service. Then on New Year’s
Day one year the family shared their wishes for the coming year. One
daughter expressed her wish that the family could be united in Christ.
When Deok Ja’s husband heard that, he responded, “I’ll try.”
   He kept his promise and began attending church with the family. One
Sabbath he stood in church and said, “I’m here because I’ve seen God
through my wife, who has prayed for me faithfully for many years.” In
time he surrendered his life to Christ and was baptized. Today Deok Ja’s
husband invites his colleagues to special meetings in the church.
   Deok Ja continues to bring people to Christ through every means pos-
sible. Her daughter has caught her mother’s spirit of evangelism and plans
to serve a year in the church’s 1000 Missionary Movement program in the
Philippines.
   “Evangelism is giving,” Deok Ja says. “And our church has many great
programs that help us to share God’s love with others. Our mission offer-
ings help make this outreach possible, and when someone gives their life
to Christ, I invite them to share the blessings they’ve received with others.
In this way many will come to know my beautiful Savior.”


Deok Ja lives in southwestern Korea.

      The Priestly Garments of
      Grace


      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Exod. 32:1–6; Lev. 21:7–22:8;
      Exodus 28; Rev. 21:12–14; Heb. 4:14, 15.

Memory Text: “But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priest-
      hood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth
      the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his
      marvellous light” (1 Peter 2:9).



      O
              ne great theme from the Protestant Reformation is what
              has been called “the priesthood of all believers,” the idea—
              derived especially (but not solely) from the above text—that
      all Christians function as priests before God and that, because they
      have Jesus, they don’t need earthly mediators (as in some religious
      systems) between them and the Lord. “For there is one God, and one
      mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus” (1 Tim. 2:5).
         After the life, death, resurrection, and high priestly ministry of
      Jesus, the old Hebrew system that God had initiated was fulfilled in
      Christ. The Levitical priesthood has been replaced and a new order
      established, one in which we all are part of the “royal priesthood.”
         This week, as we study the garments worn by the priests in the old
      system, we can learn a bit about what it means to be priests in the
      new.

     Old Covenant Grace
        Jesus said it about as clearly as human language could express it:
     “ ‘From everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded;
     and from the one who has been entrusted with much, much more will
     be asked’ ” (Luke 12:48, NIV). It’s a powerful principle, one that we
     as Adventists, with all that we have been given (and we have been
     given so much!), would do well to take seriously. Just compare the
     truths we have been given with some of the other doctrines out there
     (eternal torment in hell, Sabbath changed to Sunday, 144,000 Jewish
     virgins preaching the gospel when the church is secretly raptured dur-
     ing the reign of the antichrist) in order to understand all that we have
     been entrusted with.
        Hence, it is this principle that makes the sin of Aaron and the
     golden calf that much worse.

Read Exodus 32:1–6. What possible excuse could Aaron have had for
     partaking in this flagrant apostasy?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        The apostasy itself was bad enough, but that Aaron acquiesced in
     it seems even more incredible. Think about all that Aaron had been
     privileged with. Aaron was right there with Moses from the start
     (Exod. 4:27–30); Aaron was Moses’ spokesman before Pharaoh (Exod.
     7:1); Aaron cast down the rod that became a serpent (vs. 10); Aaron
     smote the waters that turned to blood (vs. 20); and Aaron was part
     of a select few who were able to approach the Lord in a very special
     way (Exod. 24:9, 10). In short, the man had been given privileges that
     few in history ever had, and yet, when a great test came, he failed
     miserably.
        However, and here’s the amazing thing, God not only forgave
     Aaron his sin, the Lord eventually allowed Aaron to wear the sacred
     garments as the covenant nation’s first high priest, a type for the high
     priestly ministry of Jesus Himself (Heb. 8:1). In other words, though
     Aaron was guilty of a terrible sin himself, he was also the recipient
     of God’s redeeming grace; grace so great that it not only forgave him
     but allowed Aaron to assume a sacred office that, at its core, is all
     about God’s grace and mercy and forgiveness. Thus, Aaron’s life is a
     special example of mercy and redemption available to all in Christ.

      Have you ever failed, even miserably, to live up to what you
      have been given? How can you get hope from Aaron’s example
      for yourself that all is not lost, even despite your mistakes?

                                                                         39

     The Priesthood
       “And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with
     him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister unto
     me in the priest’s office, even Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar
     and Ithamar, Aaron’s sons” (Exod. 28:1).

       The Levitical priesthood was established during the wilderness
     wanderings of the children of Israel (see Gen. 14:18) and was to last
     more than fifteen hundred years. Although the concept of a priest-
     hood to the Lord had already long existed, the establishment of the
     Levitical priesthood provided a clearer view of its role.
       As we saw yesterday, despite the enormity of his sin, Aaron was
     chosen by the Lord to become the first head of this new priesthood.
     This shows that the priests needed to be able to relate to the people
     whom they represented before God, because that was exactly what
     they were doing: acting as representatives, mediators between fallen
     humanity and a holy God. Aaron, as a fallen human being, easily
     could relate to the fallen human beings whom he was to represent.
     Who would he be to judge others in their sin when he was hardly
     innocent himself?
       At the same time, the priesthood was a sacred honor, and the priests
     were to represent holiness and purity. After all, they were the ones
     who were standing before the Lord in place of the people. They had to
     be “holy”; otherwise, what was the point of a priesthood? They had to
     be different, not in an arbitrary way (different just to be different) but
     different in a sacred sense, a sense that would—while acknowledging
     their closeness to those whom they were representing—clearly dif-
     ferentiate them from the masses as a whole.

What were some of the things required of the priests, and what do
     you think these things were to represent? Lev. 21:7–22:8.		
     _______________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________

        However difficult some of these concepts are for us today to grasp,
     the idea nevertheless should be clear: the priesthood was to be some-
     thing different, sacred, and special. Priests were symbols of Jesus, and
     their work was to symbolize, in shadows and types, what Jesus would
     do in our behalf.

      Should we be different from the world around us? If so, why,
      and in what ways?

     Priestly Garments
       “And these are the garments which they shall make; a breast-
     plate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a mitre,
     and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy
     brother, and his sons, that he may minister unto me in the priest’s
     office” (Exod. 28:4).

       As one studies the earthly sanctuary model, it should be clear that
     nothing was left to chance. God gave the priests explicit instructions
     on what was to be done. This also is apparent when it came to the gar-
     ments that the priests were to wear. Everything was done according
     to exact instructions.

Read Exodus 28, the description of the clothing that was to be made
     for Aaron, the high priest, and for the priests in general. Without
     getting caught up in intricate details, what spiritual lessons can
     we take in general from what is being presented here?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       “The pattern of the priestly robes was made known to Moses in the
     mount. Every article the high priest was to wear, and the way it should be
     made, were specified. These garments were consecrated to a most solemn
     purpose. By them was represented the character of the great antitype,
     Jesus Christ. They covered the priest with glory and beauty, and made
     the dignity of his office to appear. When clothed with them, the priest
     presented himself as a representative of Israel, showing by his garments
     the glory that Israel should reveal to the world as the chosen people of
     God.”—Ellen G. White, The Youth’s Instructor, June 7, 1900.
       A great deal has been written over the centuries about the supposed
     meaning and symbolism of each color and fabric and stone and chain
     and the like. Whatever their individual meanings, together they repre-
     sented the perfection and holiness and beauty and dignity of “the great
     Antitype,” Jesus our true High Priest who ministers in the sanctuary
     in heaven (Heb. 8:1, 2).
       Notice, too, in the texts the idea of the priests bearing various things
     (Exod. 28:12, 29, 30, 38, 42). This, of course, is a crucial theme in
     the whole plan of salvation, which the priesthood and sanctuary
     symbolized—the idea of Jesus, our Substitute, bearing in Himself our
     sins and taking upon Himself the punishment for them. All of this was
     foreshadowed through the sanctuary service and the clothing of the
     priests, filled with symbolism that represented the character and work
     of Jesus in our behalf.
                                                                           41

     Breastplate of Judgment
        Of all the vestments worn by the priests, the breastplate of judgment
     (Exod. 28:15) to be worn by the high priest was the most elaborate and
     intricate. The other garments were more like a backdrop to this sacred
     part of the priestly vestment. Considerable time, about one-third of the
     chapter (Exod. 28:15–30), is spent describing the construction of this
     sacred ornament. That alone should indicate something of just how cen-
     tral and important it was to the ministry of the priests in the sanctuary.

Read Exodus 28:15–30. What is the meaning of the different stones?
     What does it mean that the priest would “bear the names of the
     sons of Israel over his heart”? Vs. 29, NIV; see also Rev. 21:12–14.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Here, in a unique way, we see again the theme of the priest, a sym-
     bol of Jesus, bearing His people. The Hebrew word there for “bear”
     is a common word in the Old Testament for the bearing of sin, some-
     thing that the priests would do as part of their ministry (Lev. 10:17;
     Exod. 28:38; Num. 18:1, 22). Now, though, it’s used in the context of
     the priest bearing the names of Israel; though the immediate context
     is somewhat different, the idea is still there: God’s people must be
     completely dependent upon the Lord, who forgives them, who sus-
     tains them, and who offers them the power to live the holy lives that
     He demands from His people (Phil. 4:13).
        Notice, too, where the priest bears the names of the people. Upon
     his heart. The text specifically mentions that location, a common sym-
     bol in the Bible (and in many cultures) that reveals the love and tender
     care that the Lord has for His children.
        Another important point is that each tribe had a different gem, each
     with different qualities, to symbolize the distinctiveness of each tribe
     (see Genesis 49). Commentators have seen this as a way to point out
     the distinctive differences and traits, not just in the twelve tribes, nor
     just in the Twelve Apostles (Rev. 21:14), but of the church as a whole,
     which is made of various “living stones” (1 Pet. 2:5, NIV). No matter
     how different we all are in personality, character, and gifts, we are
     still to be united in purpose under the grace and Lordship of our great
     High Priest, Jesus.

      What are ways that you have personally experienced the love of
      God? How has He shown you that He has you near His heart?
      Why is it important to dwell on those experiences, and how can
      you draw strength from them, especially in times of trial?

      Jesus, Our High Priest
        “Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through
      the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we
      profess. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize
      with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every
      way, just as we are—yet was without sin” (Heb. 4:14, 15, NIV). What
      hope and promise do you find in these two verses that you can apply
      to your own life and in your own struggle with temptation?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

     Because Christ resides today as our Priest in the sanctuary in
   heaven, He, in a sense, wears the breastplate on His heart, as well. And
   because He “ever liveth to make intercession” (Heb. 7:25) for us, we
   should find comfort in the knowledge that our High Priest is touched
   with the feelings of our problems, pains, and temptations. Like Aaron,
   Jesus had been a human being who knew the trials, tribulations, and
   temptations of all humanity; unlike Aaron, however, Jesus was “with-
   out sin,” a crucial distinction, for out of His sinlessness we can claim
   two wonderful promises: (1) the robe of His righteousness can be ours
   by faith, and thus, we know that we stand perfect before God; and (2)
   we can have the power to overcome temptation just as Jesus did.
     		
Read Hebrews 8:10–13. What promises are there for us, and how
   should these promises be made manifest in our lives?
   		
   ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         Here we can see both aspects of what it means to have salvation in
      Christ, to be covered in His righteousness. How wonderful is the promise
      that the Lord will be “merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins
      and their iniquities will I remember no more” (vs. 12). He is talking about
      those who through faith have surrendered to Jesus and have claimed His
      New-Covenant promises, those who have His law written in their hearts
      and thus obey it, not to achieve salvation but because they already have
      it. Clothed in the covering of His righteousness, they now live out that
      righteousness in their own lives. That’s the heart and soul of the New
      Covenant.
                                                                             43

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Tabernacle and Its
         Services,” pp. 347, 348, in Patriarchs and Prophets; “The Lord’s
         Vineyard,” p. 288, in Christ’s Object Lessons; “Destroyed for Lack
         of Knowledge,” p. 293, in Prophets and Kings; “The Sanctuary,”
         pp. 250–253, in Early Writings; “What Is the Sanctuary?” p. 416,

           “Christ is the minister of the true tabernacle, the high priest of all
         who believe in Him as a personal Saviour, and His office no other
         can take. He is the high priest of the church.”—Ellen G. White, That
         I May Know Him, p. 74.
           “We should daily exercise faith; and that faith should daily increase
         as it is exercised, as we realize that He has not only redeemed us, but
2
         has loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood, and has
         made us kings and priests unto God and the Father.”—Ellen G. White,
         Sons and Daughters of God, p. 287.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Read Revelation 1:5, 6, where Jesus tells us about His job
          description and then gives us what we might call an “eagerly
          anticipated promise.” Discuss what is meant in verse 6 where
3         He says that He has made us to be “kings and priests” to serve
          Him forever.

          l2 Go over some of the other garments worn by the priests as
          revealed in Exodus 28. What spiritual lessons and truths can be
          found there, as well?

          l
          3 We have been warned about the danger of pretending to don
          the garments of righteousness but not really living a righteous
          life. Talk about ways to evaluate our own motives and actions.
          How can we know if we really are wearing His robe of righteous-
          ness or if we are just fooling ourselves? What are ways to know
          if we are covered or if we are really walking around in the shame
          of our nakedness?

          l
          4 Discuss the idea from Sunday’s lesson about the grace and
          forgiveness extended to Aaron. This man, who had been given a
          high responsibility, failed to live up to that responsibility, and,
          as a result, tragedy ensued. And yet, Aaron eventually was given
          an even greater responsibility. Is there anything we can take
          away from this story for ourselves, as a church, when someone
          given great responsibility also fails to live up to the responsibil-
          ity? Discuss.

The Power of Influence
   Samara is nine years old and lives in northern Brazil. Since she was
an infant, her parents have taught her to love and honor God. So, it was
natural that when she saw the ice cream vendor come through her neigh-
borhood with a cigarette in his mouth, she told him that smoking was bad
for his health and made Jesus sad.
   The man threw his cigarette down and asked to speak to Samara’s
mother.
   “Your daughter is a wise little girl,” he said. “She has taught me that
smoking is bad, and I want you to know that I will never smoke again.”
   After that, whenever the man passed by Samara’s house, he’d ask,
“Where’s my little teacher?” Samara called the man Tio, which means
“uncle.” Samara’s father talked to Tio about Jesus, too, and invited him
to church. Tio agreed, but he lived too far away to attend the family’s
church, so Father gave him directions to an Adventist church closer to his
home. Tio went to that church, and in time, he gave his heart to Jesus.
   Sometime later, on a Sabbath afternoon, Samara saw a teenage boy sit-
ting on his front porch next door. It was her new neighbor, Eduardo. She
started talking to him and asked him if he believed in God. Eduardo said
that they used to attend church, but the family had stopped going.
   Samara invited Eduardo to attend the Sunday evening program at her
church. Eduardo went and took his little brother. Samara asked the broth-
ers to study the Bible. The brothers agreed, so Samara and her father
studied the Bible with them.
   When Eduardo finished the Bible studies, he accepted Jesus as his
Savior and asked to be baptized. Samara hadn’t been baptized yet, so she
asked if she could be baptized with Eduardo. Her parents and the pastor
agreed, so the two friends were baptized together.
   Eduardo’s family has moved away, but he keeps in touch with Samara’s
family and has told them that he is sharing God’s love with others and is
giving Bible studies in his new hometown.
   Samara enjoys sharing God’s love with others and credits her parents
with being good examples who helped her make sharing her faith a natural
part of her life. Recently, when she preached for children’s Sabbath, 15
people gave their hearts to Jesus.
   Samara knows that age doesn’t matter when it comes to telling others
about Jesus; God can use anyone who is willing.



Samara lives in northern Brazil.

      F
             ew biblical characters have had a more colorful existence than
             the prophet Elijah. What an incredible story of faith, of trial, and
             of God’s overwhelming power in this world.
         Today, in Judaism at least, he still looms large. In fact, in Jewish
      tradition he has been glorified more than perhaps any other biblical
      figure.
         Each Passover, for instance, a special cup of wine is filled and put
      on the Passover table. During the Passover itself, the door of the house
      is opened, and everyone stands in order to allow Elijah the prophet to
      enter and drink. At circumcisions, a chair, “the chair of Elijah,” is set
      aside as part of the ceremony. Also, as the Sabbath ends, Jews sing
      about Elijah, hoping he will come “speedily, in our days . . . along
      with the Messiah, son of David, to redeem us.”
         An example of Elijah’s prominence in Jewish thinking is found in
      the Gospel of Matthew, when Peter says that some had thought Jesus
      Himself was Elijah (Matt. 16:14).
         This week we’ll look at Elijah and the mantle he wore and see what
      spiritual lessons we can draw from him and it.

     “A Still Small Voice”
       Elijah’s life, recorded in 1 and 2 Kings, includes instances where he
     bravely faced kings and their threats on his life. There was, however,
     one notable exception—the time when, scared by threats from a nasty
     queen, he ran for his life.
       In 1 Kings 18, he called down fire from heaven onto Mount
     Carmel, had the prophets of Baal slaughtered, and warned Ahab of
     the approaching rain. The power of the Lord came upon him, and
     after he tucked his cloak into his belt, he ran ahead of Ahab for the
     20 miles to Jezreel.
       By the next chapter, however, this same man of God appears in a
     whole new light.

Read 1 Kings 19:1–4. What lessons can we take from this passage
     regarding how, no matter what our relationship with God has
     been, no matter what great triumphs of faith we have experi-
     enced, none of us are immune from deep spiritual lows?
     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       The Lord, though, wasn’t done with Elijah, not even after his rather
     desperate and somewhat pathetic prayer. He still gave Elijah powerful
     evidence of His love for him and His interest in Elijah’s life.

Read 1 Kings 19:5–19. What is the significance of Elijah’s wrapping
     his face in the mantle?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        It’s fascinating that though Elijah saw a great wind, an earthquake,
     and a fire, none of these caused him to wrap his face in his mantle. It
     was only the presence of the Lord in “a still small voice” that brought
     this response to him—a response of fear, respect, and self-protection.
        What Elijah needed to learn was that, mighty and moving though these
     forces be, they do not of themselves portray a true picture of the Spirit of
     God. Elijah heard the voice of the Lord in a quiet and subtle way, telling
     him what to do, and it was this voice that he obeyed.

      How can we learn to recognize the voice of the Lord speaking to
      us? More important, however, is this question: do you obey what
      you hear, or do you squelch that “still small voice” speaking to
      your soul? What does your answer tell you about yourself?
                                                                             47

      The Change of Garments
         After the magnificent demonstration of God’s power at Mount
      Carmel, Elijah complained that he was the only one left who loved
      the Lord. The Lord, it seems, ignored Elijah’s whining, but when he
      finished his speech, the Lord then gave him instructions: he was to
      anoint two kings and Elisha.
         Following the Lord’s directions to find a successor, Elijah went to
      the farm of Shaphat, Elisha’s father, and found Elisha plowing with
      oxen. Maybe Elijah waved to Elisha to get his attention, and Elisha
      stopped his work and waited to hear Elijah’s message.

Read 1 Kings 19:19. How was the call of Elisha demonstrated there
      in the field?

      ________________________________________________________

        We aren’t given the exact words of Elijah or Elisha’s response to
      the call of Elijah, but we do know that he responded positively. Elijah
      now cast his mantle, a symbol of his responsibilities as a servant of
      God, on Elisha’s shoulders (see Num. 20:28). The symbolism is pretty
      obvious. Elisha was now given a sacred calling.

In other incidents of the Bible, a mantle (or cloak or some similar gar-
      ment) was not always used as an indication of God’s invitation to
      serve Him. How is the idea of a mantle used in these verses: Job 1:20;
      Psalm 109:29; Jude 22, 23; 2 Samuel 10:3, 4; Ezekiel 16:15, 16?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Elijah’s mantle here meant devotion, commitment, and dedication.
      “As Elijah, divinely directed in seeking a successor, passed the field in
      which Elisha was plowing, he cast upon the young man’s shoulders the
      mantle of consecration. During the famine the family of Shaphat had
      become familiar with the work and mission of Elijah, and now the Spirit
      of God impressed Elisha’s heart as to the meaning of the prophet’s act.
      To him it was the signal that God had called him to be the successor of
      Elijah.”—Ellen G. White, Prophets and Kings, pp. 219, 220.

       Think about how a single object can have both good and bad
       connotations, depending on how it is used. What are you doing
       with the things in your own life? What kind of meanings are
       you, by your actions, giving them? What have they come to
       symbolize to you, and why?

     The Wearing of Sackcloth
        In the Elijah narratives, clothing comes into play with other char-
     acters, as well.
        Ahab, the king of Israel, wished to purchase a vineyard that was
     next to the palace. It belonged to Naboth, a Jezreelite. When Naboth
     refused to sell it and Jezebel heard about it, she became incensed and
     cleverly laid a plot for Naboth’s demise. After Naboth’s death, Ahab
     took possession of the vineyard, not realizing that Elijah had been
     instructed to meet him there.
        “ ‘You shall speak to him, saying, “Thus says the Lord: ‘Have
     you murdered and also taken possession?’ ” And you shall speak to
     him saying, “Thus says the Lord: ‘In the place where dogs licked the
     blood of Naboth, dogs shall lick your blood, even yours’ ” ’ ” (1 Kings
     21:19, NKJV).
        Elijah’s mission to face Ahab on several serious issues should have
     produced a fair amount of stress, but he seemed strong and willing,
     at least here, to follow the instructions from his Lord even though he
     knew his life could be in danger. Now he must tell Ahab what denun-
     ciations the Lord has pronounced on him besides the one about the
     dogs licking his blood.

Read 1 Kings 21:21–29. How are we to understand Ahab’s response,
     especially in light of what those verses say about the kind of man
     he was?
     ________________________________________________________
     ________________________________________________________

       When Ahab heard these words, he presented himself to the Lord
     in an exceedingly humble way (1 Kings 21:27), which included him
     tearing his clothes, putting on sackcloth, and even refusing to eat. The
     rest of the chapter implies that his repentance and humility must have
     been genuine. The tearing of his robe, a common action in that time to
     represent horror and sorrow, revealed that he truly accepted the truth
     of what Elijah said to him. How deep, how long lasting that repen-
     tance went, the text doesn’t say; what it does say is that the rending of
     his robe revealed the sincerity of his heart at that time.

      “Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and
      leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death” (2 Cor. 7:10,
      NIV). Read the immediate context of that verse. What is Paul
      saying here, and how can we apply this warning to our own
      lives?

     The Taking of Elijah
       Whatever one can say about Elijah, he certainly had an interesting
     and dramatic time of it (though, no doubt, he’s having more fun now).
     Second Kings 1 tells a fascinating story which leads into an even more
     fascinating one in the next chapter. If it could be said that anyone, to
     use the cliché, went out in a blaze of glory, it was Elijah.

Read 2 Kings 2:1–18 and answer the following questions:
     1. What reasons might Elisha have had for refusing to separate from
     Elijah, despite the master’s three requests that he do just that?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     2. Why did Elisha tear his clothes here? Was it for mourning or
     something else? If so, what?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       No doubt Elisha’s response was one of extreme excitement and
     gratefulness. Yes, he did see the chariot and the horses. Yes, he would
     have a double portion of Elijah’s power. Although, generally, the
     tearing of clothes meant mourning, this time Elisha may have been
     so overwhelmed that he tore his clothes in gratitude. He had in his
     hands Elijah’s cloak. His tearing of his clothes also could have been
     symbolic of his getting rid of his own and putting on Elijah’s.
       When Elijah first put his mantle on farmer Elisha, both men knew
     that this act symbolized a calling to work for God (though Elisha must
     have given it back to Elijah at some point). Elisha now had this special
     garment in his own possession, signifying that he must carry on the
     responsibilities of leadership as Elijah had done.
       Look, too, at Elisha’s request of his mentor. (What request does
     this remind you of?) Elisha’s words reveal something of his character,
     showing that he was a worthy successor to wear the mantle of the
     great prophet who was about “to be taken” from this world.

      What broader picture of existence does this story present to us?
      That is, how often do we tend to hold a narrow, materialistic
      view of the world, forgetting the ever-present reality of the
      supernatural realm, which also exists in this world and which
      interacts with us?

      The Cloak
        “He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and
      went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan; and he took the
      mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and
      said, Where is the Lord God of Elijah? and when he also had
      smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha
      went over” (2 Kings 2:13, 14). What story does this make us think
      of? What important symbolism is seen there?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

Read 2 Kings 2:15–18. Try to put yourself in the place of these proph-
      ets from Jericho. Why might they have reacted as they did, trying
      to find Elijah, even though they knew that he had been taken?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         It is obvious from earlier texts that the prophets knew Elijah was
      going to be taken. The text doesn’t say if they themselves saw the event.
      In one sense, it doesn’t really matter, because they knew that the “Spirit
      of the Lord” had taken him. To where, though, was another matter. For
      some reason they believed that Elijah still could be found “on some
      mountain or in some valley” (vs. 16, NIV). Perhaps not prepared for the
      idea of someone being whisked off to heaven like that, they assumed
      the Lord did something else with him. And though they had the words
      of Elisha not to bother trying to find him, they insisted on it anyway.
      Perhaps, only then, after not finding him, did they realize what hap-
      pened. Yet, even then there was room for doubt. Maybe the Lord set
      him down on some mountain or valley they hadn’t checked?
         In the end, no matter the experiences or miracles we have seen, we
      still need to exercise faith, or else, sooner or later, doubt will creep in
      and seriously challenge our Christian experience.
         		
       Think about some powerful experience you had with the Lord.
       No question, at the time and right after, your faith was strong.
       Over time, however, what happened, especially as the experi-
       ence itself started receding in the stream of time? Thus, why is
       it important that you, on a daily basis, do things that can help
       keep your faith strong?

                                                                             51

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Seth and Enoch,” p. 88,
         in Patriarchs and Prophets; “From Jezreel to Horeb,” “What Doest
         Thou Here?” and “In the Spirit and Power of Elias,” pp. 155–189, in
         Prophets and Kings.

            “Elijah, who had been translated to heaven without seeing death,
         represented those who will be living upon the earth at Christ’s second
         coming, and who will be ‘changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of
         an eye, at the last trump;’ when ‘this mortal must put on immortal-
         ity;’ and ‘this corruptible must put on incorruption.’ 1 Cor. 15:51–53.
         Jesus was clothed with the light of heaven, as He will appear when
2
         He shall come ‘the second time without sin unto salvation.’ For He
         will come ‘in the glory of His Father with the holy angels.’ Heb. 9:28;
         Mark 8:38.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 422.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 What are practical things we can do to help us hear “the still
          small voice”? What things do we do that make that difficult,
          if not impossible? How does willful sin, in a big way, make us
3         “hard of hearing,” so to speak?

          l2 When you experience despair and discouragement that are
          almost more than you can bear, how do you know, as Elijah did,
          that the Lord is near and watching over you?

          l3 The mantle of Elijah symbolized the succession of his minis-
          try to Elisha, which brings up the question of succession in the
          church today. How does the process work, and how can we be
          sure that the right people are, to use an Elisha cliché, “handed
          the mantle”? Or can we?

          l4 “Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and
          leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death” (2 Cor. 7:10,
          NIV). In class, talk about what this text means and what we must
          learn from it ourselves about what true repentance is as opposed
          to a repentance that, itself, needs to be repented of?

          l5 In this quarter’s lesson on clothing and garments, we are
          dealing with a lot of symbols. What are symbols, how are they
          interpreted, what meanings do we give to symbols, and what do
          those meanings tell us about ourselves?

Curses and Blessings
   João grew up in Angola in southwestern Africa. His family attended a
Christian church, but their beliefs were mixed with spirit worship. When
his mother became seriously ill, family members were sure her husband
had cursed her. She fled with her four children to Namibia.
   Life was hard, and João’s mother sent her children to live with other people.
João had to quit school and herd cattle. João was unhappy and ran away; he
found his way back to Angola and lived with two of his aunts. But his aunts
made and sold homemade beer, and soon young João was drinking beer too.
   A friend gave him a little New Testament, and João began reading it.
He stopped drinking and returned to his family’s church. But something
was missing.
   One day he heard a radio program sponsored by the Seventh-day Adventist
Church. The teachings caught his attention. He had never heard of the
Sabbath before and asked the priest at his family’s church about Sabbath.
When the priest didn’t answer his questions, João stopped attending church.
He compared what he heard on the radio programs with his New Testament
and realized that the Adventists taught the truth. But he hesitated to visit an
Adventist church, for his family said Adventists were witches. He visited
several other churches, but none of them satisfied his thirst for truth.
   One day João noticed a new church near the edge of town. He saw a
sign announcing evangelistic meetings, so he decided to attend. João was
impressed with the messages he heard, and, at the end of the series, he
surrendered his life to God.
   But his relatives were unhappy about his decision, for they still believed
that Adventists were witches. João continued attending the Adventist
church in spite of their accusations. He wanted to prove that Adventists
were not witches. In time he was baptized, fully aware that life at home
would be difficult.
   Schools in Angola hold classes on Saturday, but God impressed him
to honor the Sabbath day instead of study. His mother urged João to stop
attending the Adventist church, because it went against the family’s tra-
ditional beliefs. But João told her that Adventist beliefs were in line with
the Bible, which was God’s firm word.
   Eventually, his mother allowed João to attend worship services in
peace. Today he enjoys an active ministry that includes translating mate-
rial for the radio program that led him to the church in the first place.
   Our mission offerings support outreach efforts such as evangelistic meet-
ings and radio and television broadcasts in Angola and around the world.

      In the Shadow of His
      Wings


      Sabbath Afternoon				
                   		
Read for This Week’s Study: Exod. 19:4, 2 Samuel 11,
      12, Pss. 17:8, 32:1, 36:7, 51:2, 57:1, 61:4, 63:7.

Memory Text: “Because You have been my help, therefore in
      the shadow of Your wings I will rejoice” (Psalm 63:7, NKJV).

        “There are three things which are too wonderful for me, yes,
      four which I do not understand: the way of an eagle in the air”
      (Prov. 30:18, 19, NKJV).



      T
              he eagle is a live jet fighter. Armed with a hooked beak and
              razor’s-edge talons, it is loaded like a jet fighter too. The eagle
              is wind and wing, bone, sinew, and blood. The eagle is scaven-
      ger, fisher, and thief. The eagle hurls itself from clouds toward water
      with the speed of a cyclonic storm. The eagle hobbles on balled-up
      claws in its nest to keep from dicing up its young. The eagle is maj-
      esty, power, and grace. The eagle is all these metaphors, yet greater
      than their sum. Small wonder, then, that the Bible writer failed to
      understand the fierce beauty of the eagle’s flight.
        David himself turned to a similar image in his psalms about being
      sheltered under the wings of God. This week we will meditate with
      David through his psalms on how God shelters us and covers our sin.
      But first we will look at the events that inspired his need for these
      coverings. Then we will seek to understand why we, too, need to be
      sheltered under those same wings.

     The Naked Truth
        Eagles can soar to an altitude of 10,000 feet, higher than most birds.
     Like the eagle, David soared high. The shepherd-king reached heights
     of greatness few monarchs ever attain. He was clothed in the spoils of
     military victory and covered with honor and glory. But David forgot
     that his kingly robes were a gift from God. They could not hide a
     man’s sins—even a king’s—from God’s sight.
        David’s garments, in a spiritual sense, were priestly as well as
     kingly; he was the head of Israel’s theocracy too. The bitter sins that
     stained these garments inspired Psalms 32 and 51. To appreciate fully
     the imagery in these psalms as a covering for sin and the imagery in
     other psalms of God’s wings as a divine covering, we need to look
     at how the narrative events of David’s life inspired them. How ironic
     and tragic that in a study devoted to the spiritual lessons of garments,
     the sad story of David’s fall begins in a literal lack of them.
        At the pinnacle of greatness, David faces his fiercest battle. The war
     isn’t waged on the bloody fields of Rabbah but over the six inches
     of mental turf that lies behind David’s frontal lobe. Satan chooses
     his “weapon” well. What Goliath with his monstrous lance failed to
     do to David, a bathing woman, seen from the king’s rooftop, does.
     Obviously, David forgets the lesson of his sling: how easily a “giant”
     is felled by one small stone or, in this case, one small glance.

One small stone and down falls a giant. One small glance and down
     falls a king. David did many things to “cover” his sin of adultery
     and avoid exposure. What were they? 2 Samuel 11. Why do our
     attempts to cover sin to avoid detection or punishment lead only
     to committing greater sins and to the threat of still greater expo-
     sure? How do the narrative details of David’s story enforce this
     point?


       One forbidden glance sets in motion events that end in murder and
     near civil war. David’s story is of concealment after concealment to
     avoid consequences. The awful reality of sin is that committing one
     sin, without confessing and forsaking it, leads to committing another
     more heinous sin in order to hide the previous offense. David commit-
     ted adultery and murder under the cloak of kingly power. But God’s
     eye sees beneath the outer garments and lays bare the heart.

      It has been said, “If adversity has slain its thousands, prosperity
      has slain its ten thousands.” With David’s life in mind, what dan-
      gers does prosperity expose the soul to? Why does adversity often

     Nathan Bares All
       For a whole year, David hides his sin under a veil of deceit. It looks
     as though the king has gotten away with murder. Sin hardens David’s
     heart to stone. But God sends Nathan to break it.

Read Nathan’s parable in 2 Samuel 12:1–12 and its interpretation,
     keeping in mind that Jesus also resorted to parables. What are
     the advantages of using them? What was it about David’s condi-
     tion that made clothing the truth in a story a more effective, even
     necessary, way of reaching him?

        Only a few verses long, Nathan’s parable holds precious lessons for
     reaching the sin-hardened heart. First, Nathan does not come to David as
     an accuser; instead, he humbly and tactfully solicits David’s help. David’s
     heart may be hardened by sin, but his sense of justice is not completely
     deadened. Second, by clothing the truth in a parable, Nathan breaches
     David’s defenses. Third, Nathan’s method of presentation invites David
     to listen without feeling judged. The result? David condemns himself.

Nathan’s verdict, “Thou art the man,” rips through the veil of
     self-deceit in which David shrouded himself. David’s response,
     “ ‘I have sinned against the Lord’ ” is met with “ ‘the Lord also
     has put away your sin’ ” (vs. 13, NKJV). Why was the Lord able
     to put away, or cover, David’s sin? See 1 John 1:9.

       David’s sin is covered, but the child conceived in sin must die. For
     David, this tragedy must have been more bitter than his own death.
     He removes his kingly robes and puts on the garments of humility
     and mourning. He openly prostrates himself before God in repentance,
     pleading for his child’s life. How ironic that, a year earlier, under
     the cover of darkness, David secretly prostrated himself in lust with
     Bathsheba on that fatal eve his dying child was conceived.
       David reacts to the child’s death in a manner that baffles his advisors.
     He rises. He bathes. He changes his clothes. He, the anointed of God,
     anoints himself anew and worships God. These actions demonstrate
     how those who have mourned for their sins must allow God to restore
     them: First, God raises the grieving sinner and bears him to Himself.
     Next, He washes away the guilt of our sin and clothes us in His righ-
     teousness. He anoints us with His Spirit so that we may worship Him.
       David’s fall into sin begins and ends with a bath. This final wash-
     ing, however, is not a prelude to sin but a sign of a clean heart.

      What hope do David’s bathing, garment change, and anointing
      give us? Why can we who have been washed clean by Jesus have
      full assurance that we may come worship Him?

      Blessed Is He Whose Sin Is Covered . . .
        “Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is
      covered” (Ps. 32:1).

        For a whole year after his sin against Uriah and Bathsheba, David
      refuses to confess his sin, even to himself. But as Psalm 32 tells us, he
      suffers severe agony of mind and body as a result of his silence.

Read Psalm 32:3–5. In what ways does David use poetic imagery
      and symbolic language to describe what happens to him when he
      refuses to confess his sin? According to verse 5, what does David
      do to end his suffering?

      ________________________________________________________

        With lies and bloodshed David covers his sin of adultery, but the
      weight of his own guilt crushes him. As Psalm 32 shows, though, David
      casts himself in true humility and repentance on the sure mercy of
      God. In his cry for forgiveness, David does a number of things that are
      instructive for all who seek God’s covering of forgiveness: (1) David
      makes no excuse for his sin; (2) he makes no attempt to justify himself;
      (3) he does not find fault with God’s law for condemning him; (4) he
      blames only himself for his sin; and (5) he genuinely hates the sin that
      separated him from God and turns from it. And God covers it.

David conceals his sin (Ps. 32:3, 4); God covers it (vss. 1, 2). What
      is the difference between our concealing and God’s covering?
      Before the righteousness of Christ can cover sin, what must be
      done to it?

      ________________________________________________________

        God does not overlook sin. But sin is covered, meaning its guilt is no
      longer to be imputed, or brought against, the sinner when it is repented
      of. Confession alone is incomplete without repentance. We must not
      only be sorry for our sin, we must turn away from it in God’s power.
      God can forgive and cover all sin. His grace not only forgives sin but
      accepts the repentant sinner as though he or she never sinned! That is
      the power of Jesus, our Substitute, upon whom God lays the sin. In this
      way, Christ’s righteousness is imputed to the repentant sinner.

       How readily do you acknowledge before God your own sin and
       wrongdoing? If you do not, in the end, are you deceiving God or
       only yourself? Dwell on the implications of your answer.


                                                                           59

      Whiter Than Snow
         Psalm 51, like Psalm 32, is a penitential psalm, written after David
      confesses his sin. Just as Psalm 32 alludes to garments in order to illu-
      minate the concept of God’s covering for sin, Psalm 51 also alludes
      to the imagery of garments as a sin covering. But here the emphasis
      is on the washing and whitening agents used to clean garments and
      on their spiritual significance. In other words, in this psalm, David
      metaphorically does his “dirty laundry.”

In Psalm 51:2, David asks God to wash him thoroughly. What does this
      washing involve? How do the images of “purge me with hyssop”
      and “whiter than snow” (vs. 7) help us understand the nature of
      this cleansing?

        The word that David uses here for washing is used elsewhere in
      Scripture to refer to the washing of a garment (see Gen. 49:11, Exod.
      19:10). Purge suggests the idea of making atonement for sin. Hyssop,
      a gray-green marjoram plant, was used as a spice and had medicinal
      properties, thus it was both a nutritive and a healing agent. Hyssop,
      as David knew well, had a long history in Israel. It was used in the
      original Passover ritual (Exod. 12:22), in the day of cleansing a leper
      or a house (Lev. 14:6, 49), and in the offering of the red heifer for the
      purification of men and items unclean through contact with the dead.
      Moses used hyssop at the ratification of the covenant (Heb. 9:19, 20).
      See “Hyssop” in The SDA Bible Dictionary.
        All these uses signify that hyssop was a powerful cleansing agent.
      David’s use of hyssop shows he understood that only the remedy with
      the greatest purifying power could cleanse him from sin’s defilement.
      And that remedy is the atoning blood of our Savior.

In Psalm 51:10, David prays for God to create in him a clean heart.
      What does having a “clean heart” mean?

        God does not merely cleanse the heart from iniquity; He creates
      in His forgiven child a new heart. A new heart is a new mind. Paul
      exhorts us, “Be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed
      by the renewing of your mind” (Rom. 12:2) “through the washing of
      regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out
      on us abundantly through Jesus Christ” (Titus 3:5, 6, NKJV). Prayer
      for forgiveness always should be united with prayer for heart renewal
      and holy living. David desires to be clothed in an entirely new mental
      and moral nature. He prays to be steadfast in obedience and not to be
      deprived of the guidance of the Holy Spirit.

     In the Sanctuary of His Wings
       “I will abide in Your tabernacle forever; I will trust in the shel-
     ter of Your wings” (Ps. 61:4, NKJV).

       Some eagles have wingspans of up to nine feet under which they
     can shelter and protect their hatchlings. God’s mercy, like the wings
     of the eagle, shelters those who forsake their sins, no matter how deep
     they may have fallen. But unlike the guilt of our sin, which is blotted
     out, the consequences or results of sin often may not be removed.
     David experienced the bitter reality of this truth, fourfold, in the
     deaths of three of his sons and in the rape of his daughter Tamar by
     her own half-brother, Amnon.
       Sure, his sin had been forgiven, he could have peace in that sense.
     But in another sense, pain and suffering were to be his lot, all from a
     sin that had been forgiven.
       May we all take heed!

What did David seek in the shadow of God’s wings? What do they
     offer us covering from? Pss. 17:8, 36:7, 57:1.
     									
     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       David probably composed Psalm 61 while in exile during the time
     Absalom usurped the throne. It declares trust in the covering mercy
     of God, possibly referring to the mercy seat in God’s sanctuary. Here
     rests the ark of God’s covenant with His people, with its covering
     cherubim, whose overarching wings shelter the law—the written tran-
     script of God’s character of love. David may have been expressing
     a desire to dwell, through faith, with God in His sanctuary, his soul
     garbed in the transforming light of that love.

      Perhaps, even now, though you’ve dedicated your life anew to
      God, you are suffering the consequences of sin: estrangement,
      exile, physical ailment, or emotional pain. What hope of healing
      does the shelter of God’s wings offer?

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “David’s Sin and Repentance,”
         pp. 717–726, in Patriarchs and Prophets; “Bible Biographies,”
         p. 157, in Education.

           “David’s repentance was sincere and deep. There was no effort
         to palliate his crime. No desire to escape the judgments threatened,
         inspired his prayer. But he saw the enormity of his transgression against
         God; he saw the defilement of his soul; he loathed his sin. It was not
         for pardon only that he prayed, but for purity of heart. David did not in
1        despair give over the struggle. In the promises of God to repentant sin-
         ners he saw the evidence of his pardon and acceptance. . . .
           “Though David had fallen, the Lord lifted him up. He was now
         more fully in harmony with God and in sympathy with his fellow men
         than before he fell. . . .
           “Whoever under the reproof of God will humble the soul with
2        confession and repentance, as did David, may be sure that there is
         hope for him. Whoever will in faith accept God’s promises, will find
         pardon. The Lord will never cast away one truly repentant soul. He
         has given this promise: ‘Let him take hold of My strength, that he
         may make peace with Me; and he shall make peace with Me.’ Isaiah
         27:5. ‘Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his
         thoughts: and let him return unto the Lord, and He will have mercy
         upon him; and to our God, for He will abundantly pardon.’ Isaiah
3        55:7.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 725, 726,

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 As a class, discuss the futility of coverings of our own devis-
          ing compared with what Jesus willingly provides. What does He
          provide, and why is it the only covering for sin that can heal and
          save?

          l
          2 Try writing one of your own psalms about God’s mercy and
          love. Like David, write it from your own personal experience.
          Bring it to class and share what you have written.

          l3 Laundry detergent advertisements for bleaching agents prom-
          ise to whiten and soften clothes. To bleach out a stain without
          softening it could be too harsh for fabric. To soften fabric with-
          out attending to the stain leaves it dirty. Why, then, do we need
          both the whitening power of God’s justice and the softening
          power of His mercy to cleanse the soul’s garment?

          l4 Forgiven sin can make us miserable, but we mustn’t forget that
          it is forgiven. How can we learn that living with the consequences
          of our sin doesn’t mean that our sin hasn’t been forgiven?

Circle of Love
  Georgi Kertikov was an unbeliever living in Bulgaria when he was
called to repair some electrical appliances in a woman’s home. She invited
him to church, and he accepted, mostly because he didn’t want to lose her
as a customer.
  In Sabbath School the class was discussing the beasts from Revelation
13. Georgi was interested in Chinese mythology and fighting sports, and
this chapter of the Bible, with its dragons and beasts, really appealed to
him. He decided that any church that talked about fighting, blood, and
dragons must be pretty good. So, he continued attending and was baptized
two years later.
  Georgi married and was called to serve as a Global Mission pioneer in
a small town in Bulgaria. Three small Bible study groups had formed in
the town. The Bulgarian group had five members, the Turkish group had
some interests but no members, and a Romani (Gypsy) group had seven or
eight interests and no members. Georgi worked with all three groups for
the next 18 months, and a number of the Romani people were baptized.
  Georgi was asked to move to Chirpan, a city in southern Bulgaria that
has a sizable population of Romani. The group there had been without a
leader for several months, and a number of members had drifted away.
  Georgi began visiting the members and encouraging them to visit those
who had fallen away. Although he isn’t Romani, Georgi has learned that
Romani are highly communal people with strong family and clan ties. So,
visiting members—and teaching members how to visit—is a high priority.
  He used his carpentry and electrical skills to help make friends in the
community. He made a device to help a paralyzed man move his legs and
repaired a hole that a horse had kicked in a woman’s door. As he works,
he shares his faith.
  Georgi focuses on social events to build community between believers
and their families and friends who may not yet come to the church. He
plans picnics, work bees, sporting events, and even computer classes to
draw people together, to cement friendships and introduce people to Jesus.
Before he could teach young people how to use computers, they had to
learn to type. He assigned them to create a songbook of Turkish religious
songs that they sing in church.
  Georgi loves his work. He loves to make friends and share his love for
Jesus. Currently, he is preparing 30 people for baptism and making many
more friends in the community to whom he can introduce Jesus.
  Your mission offerings support the work of Global Mission in hard-to-
reach places around the world.
Georgi Kertikov shares his faith in Chirpan, Bulgaria.

      Garments of Splendor




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Isaiah 1–5; 6:1–8; 51:6–8,
      61; Luke 4:16–20.

Memory Text: “I delight greatly in the Lord; my soul rejoices
      in my God. For he has clothed me with garments of salvation and
      arrayed me in a robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom adorns his
      head like a priest, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels”
      (Isaiah 61:10, NIV).



      L
              iving amid the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah,
              Isaiah preached for more than four tumultuous decades, dur-
              ing which he produced some of the richest texts of the Bible.
      Written during a time of political, moral, military, and economic tur-
      moil, Isaiah’s book is permeated, not just with warnings of gloom and
      doom upon the unrepentant but with themes of salvation, deliverance,
      and hope—the hope found in “the Lord, thy Redeemer, the Holy One
      of Israel,” the One who says, “I am the Lord thy God which teacheth
      thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go”
      (Isa. 48:17).
         Isaiah urged the people to put on the glorious garments of righ-
      teousness and to accept God’s salvation. Illustrations describing gar-
      ments, coverings, and sackcloth help teach spiritual truths that have
      echoed through the ages. For Isaiah’s contemporaries and for us, the
      question is, again: do we claim the garments for ourselves, or do we
      continue in the shame of our own defilement and nakedness?

      Bring No More Futile Sacrifices
         “In that day the Lord will snatch away their finery: the bangles
      and headbands and crescent necklaces, the earrings and bracelets
      and veils, the headdresses and ankle chains and sashes, the per-
      fume bottles and charms, the signet rings and nose rings, the fine
      robes and the capes and cloaks, the purses and mirrors, and the
      linen garments and tiaras and shawls” (Isa. 3:18 –23, NIV).

        The opening chapters of Isaiah present a fairly bleak picture of the
      spiritual state of the southern kingdom. Over time, the descendants of
      those who witnessed the incredible miracles of the Exodus had fallen
      into complacency—and worse! No doubt most of them believed all
      those wonderful things happened, but the question they might have
      been asking themselves was, So what? What has any of that to do
      with us today? Why is what had happened to our ancestors long ago
      relevant to us today?

Skim through the first five chapters of Isaiah. What were some of the
      things that the people were doing, or the attitudes they had, that
      caused such a harsh warning to come upon them? What parallels
      can you find to our church today?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         Perhaps the scariest part in all this is found in the first chapter, in
      which the Lord decries all their religious observances and practices.
      In other words, these were people who professed to serve the Lord
      and who went through the forms of worship. And yet, what does the
      Lord say about them and their worship? (See Isa. 1:11–15.)
         As always, though, the Lord is gracious; as always, He is seeking
      to save all whom He can. The Cross is all the proof we’ll ever need as
      to how much the Lord wants us to have salvation. Thus, even in these
      initial chapters, we see the Lord calling out to His people, offering
      them a way to avert disaster.

       How do you worship the Lord? What are you thinking about
       when you do? How much is show, and how much is deeply felt
       submission, praise, and repentance, and how can you know the
       difference?

     Unclean Lips
        It was in the context of the horrible picture presented in yesterday’s
     lesson that the prophet Isaiah gets his call. It came about 740 b.c., the
     year King Uzziah of Israel died. Uzziah, starting out well, eventu-
     ally fell into apostasy (2 Chronicles 26) and met a terrible end. At
     this time, Isaiah began his ministry but not before getting a powerful
     vision of the Lord.

Read Isaiah 6:1–8. What kind of reaction does Isaiah have? Why is
     that so significant, especially for our understanding of the plan of
     salvation?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        “Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips,
     and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips” (Isa. 6:5).
        Notice, Isaiah’s response wasn’t about the power and majesty of
     God in contrast to his own weakness; nor was it about the eternity of
     God in contrast to his own temporality. Instead, the response was one
     dealing with morality. Isaiah, seeing this vision of God, seeing “the
     train of his robe” (Isa. 6:1, NIV) filling the temple, was overcome by
     the contrast between God’s holiness and his own sinfulness. At that
     moment, he realized that his great problem was a moral one and that
     his fallen nature and his corruption could be his ruin. Besides, how
     could he, a “man of unclean lips,” speak for the Lord of hosts?

What was the solution to this problem?

     ________________________________________________________

       The symbolic act of touching his lips with the coal revealed the
     reality of Isaiah’s conversion. He was now forgiven his sin; he had a
     new life in the Lord, and the fruit of that conversion was revealed in
     verse 8, when he cried out, “Here am I, send me.” Knowing that his
     sin was purged, he now moved ahead in faith, trusting the righteous-
     ness and holiness of God revealed to him in that vision.

      Isaiah’s guilt was purged, his sin atoned for. He was born again,
      and the immediate fruit was his willingness to answer the call,
      “Who will go for us?” Now ask yourself what kind of fruit is
      being manifested after your own conversion?

     Garments That Do Not Last
        As we saw earlier, Isaiah spent a lot of time warning about
     judgment, but he interspersed those warnings with encouraging
     promises from God. After an explanation of the Lord’s devastation
     of the earth, Isaiah spoke to those in Israel who had, in sincer-
     ity, looked forward to the fulfillment of all the promises but who
     had forgotten the many instances when the Lord led His people
     through difficult times.

Read Isaiah 51:6–8. What message is the Lord giving to the people?
     What contrasts are presented? What hope, as well?

     ________________________________________________________

        Who hasn’t seen how easily, and quickly, clothing can be dam-
     aged or wear away? It doesn’t take much, does it? The finest and
     richest apparel can be ruined. What an apt parallel for this world and
     the people on it. How quickly we’re here, how quickly we’re gone.
     James, in the New Testament, likens our existence to a “vapor” or
     a “mist” (James 4:14). Welsh poet Dylan Thomas urged his dying
     father to “not go gentle into that good night” but to “rage, rage against
     the dying of the light.” We can rage all we want, but sooner or later,
     like a garment, we are gone.
        And yet, look at what else Isaiah talks about there: God’s salvation,
     God’s righteousness, the garment of Christ’s righteousness, which
     alone brings salvation, a salvation that lasts forever. The Lord here
     is pointing us to the only two options humans face—dissolution and
     eternal death or eternal life in a new earth, one that will not “wear
     out like a garment” (vs. 6, NIV) but will remain forever. From Adam
     and Eve in Eden until the day of Christ’s coming, these have been
     and remain the two ultimate fates of all humanity. They’re mutually
     exclusive, too, meaning it’s either one or the other. Which one is a
     decision only we, as individuals, can make for ourselves?

      Read Isaiah 51:7, words addressed to those who know what is
      right, who have God’s law in their hearts. What should that
      mean to us today? How does having the law in our hearts help
      us know what is right? Is knowing what is right enough in and
      of itself to cause us to do right, or is more needed? If so, what?


                                                                          67

     Garments of Splendor
        It’s always easy when reading the Old Testament to get caught up in
     all the warning of gloom and doom. Critics of the Bible love to point
     out these things and claim, “Who would want to worship or love a
     God like that?”
        Yet, this is selective reading. Time and again the Lord, amid the
     warnings, offers a way out of the doom. Yes, rebellion and disobedi-
     ence bring the fruits of destruction. But always the Lord pleads with
     His people that this doesn’t have to be; salvation, righteousness, and
     security are there, if only we would claim them in the name of the
     Lord.

Read Isaiah 52. What is the message there? What hope is being
     offered? In that context, what is the meaning of those “garments
     of splendor” (NIV) that the people are told to wear?

        Again, we have the Lord calling His people back to repentance, obe-
     dience, and salvation. The “garments of splendor” are the garments of
     righteousness, the covering that all have who are surrendered to the
     Lord and who live by faith and obedience to His commandments. It
     was never complicated; from Eden onward, all God has asked of His
     people is to live by faith in obedience to Him.
        What’s fascinating about Isaiah 52 is how it ends and what comes
     next. It’s no coincidence that, right after calling the people to put on
     “garments of splendor,” Isaiah leads into what is the Old Testament’s
     greatest prophetic description of the substitutionary death of Jesus,
     the very act that has made the “garments of splendor” available for all
     who seek them. Only through Christ’s life and death, and all that they
     involve, could humanity be saved from the ruin that sin has brought.
        Interesting, too, how earlier on, in Isaiah 52:3, the gift of salvation,
     something we can’t earn or buy, is alluded 10. “For thus says the Lord:
     ‘You have sold yourselves for nothing, and you shall be redeemed
     without money’ ” (NKJV). How true—we do sell our souls for noth-
     ing, for things of this world, a world that will perish like a garment.
     And this has created a dilemma for us, because it’s a situation that
     we can’t buy our way out of or work our way through. It is only by
     God’s grace that we are saved, a grace revealed through the incredible
     sacrifice made for us on the cross.

     The Garments of Salvation
       Some of the most famous texts in all the Bible appear in Luke
     4:16–20, when Jesus stood up in His hometown synagogue and read
     from the book of Isaiah, chapter 61. Then, much to the amazement
     of those listening, He declared, “This day is this scripture fulfilled in
     your ears” (Luke 4:21).

Read through Isaiah 61. What is the theme of the chapter? How
     is the gospel presented here? What themes presented here are
     picked up and expounded on in the New Testament? See, for
     instance, verse 6.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        These verses are so rich, filled with all sorts of imagery from the
     Old Testament that eventually make it into the New. Central to our
     interest is verse 10: “ ‘I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul
     shall be joyful in my God; for He has clothed me with the garments
     of salvation, He has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as
     a bridegroom decks himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorns
     herself with her jewels’ ” (NKJV).
        “The provision made is complete, and the eternal righteousness of
     Christ is placed to the account of every believing soul. The costly,
     spotless robe, woven in the loom of heaven, has been provided for the
     repenting, believing sinner, and he may say: ‘I will greatly rejoice in
     the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me
     with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of
     righteousness.’ ”—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 394.
        The verb translated “decks himself ” comes from a Hebrew word
     that means to “do the work of a priest,” a prophecy of the New
     Covenant understanding of all of God’s people, those dressed in the
     garments of salvation, functioning as “priests.” They function, not
     as mediators as were the Old Testament priests or as Jesus but more
     in the sense of witnessing to others about the mercy and grace and
     salvation of God.

      Look through Isaiah 61 again. What promises can you take
      from those verses for yourself? How can you realize those
      promises for yourself; that is, what practices in your life must
      you change in order for these to be fulfilled in and for you?

                                                                          69

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Dwell more on the theme found in the early chapter of Isaiah
          regarding worship, even true forms of worship, that are unac-
          ceptable to God. What kinds of worship are offered today, even
          by us, which might be unacceptable to the Lord? Is the problem
2         the worship itself or something else, such as what the worship-
          ers are doing with themselves when they are not worshiping?
          Discuss.

          l2 Isaiah 61:3 reads, “ ‘To console those who mourn in Zion, to
          give them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the gar-
          ment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be called
          trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that He may be
3         glorified’ ” (NKJV). What is going on here? How can we experi-
          ence the promises given here?

          l3 Delmore Schwartz wrote a short story about a snowfall in
          New York City that had created, miraculously, beautiful statues
          throughout the city. People were amazed. The whole city was
          transfixed. His main character was especially moved, even quit
          his job so that he could do nothing but stare at the statues, which
          seemed to have given him a meaning and purpose in life that
          he got from nothing else. Then, according to the story, a tire-
          less and foul rain fell and overnight all the statues disappeared.
          They were gone, and things went right back to where they were
          before the statues came. As the story ended, the main character
          either fell or jumped in front of a train and died. The point was
          that by placing hopes in things of this world we are bound for
          disappointment, because the earth wears away “like a garment.”
          What have been your own experiences with how easily the things
          of this world disappoint, and what have you learned from those
          experiences?

Caught by Christ
by Jim Fong
  I grew up in a traditional Chinese family. My parents worship ancestors
and follow the traditional religions of China. They gave me an excellent
upbringing and encouraged me to excel in school. Their influence helped
me get into the best schools, and when I graduated I thought I was pretty
good—like a little god.
  I went to Australia to continue my studies. There I met another Chinese stu-
dent who invited me to attend a care group—a small Bible study group. The
small group and the Bible studies drew me to God. I am a logical person, and I
enjoyed studying Bible prophecy. I reasoned that if so many Bible prophesies
have been fulfilled, then prophesies about the future must be true, as well. I
wanted to know where we came from and where we are going. The studies
gave me hope about the future. Heaven became my goal.
  As a student, my life is really busy, but I discovered that the Sabbath
was a precious respite from work and studies. I began keeping the Sabbath
and discovered that even with fewer hours of study I still did well on my
exams and papers. I knew that God was blessing me.
  I used to think I could solve my own problems. But when I repeatedly
failed my Australian driver’s license test, I became frustrated. Finally, I
surrendered my need to God, and He gave me peace and helped me pass
the test on my next try. I’ve learned to pray about everything and let God
control the outcome.
  God taught me about prayer and about the Sabbath. But I made excuses
about baptism—I wasn’t good enough, I was too busy. Then at a retreat
for young people, God impressed me that I needed to commit my life to
Him through baptism. When I surrendered, I felt such peace!
  I’m seeing God work miracles in my life every day. He has given me a
great job right out of college, even though I’m a foreign student with little
                              experience. I understand now that everything
                              in this world is under God’s control.
                                 I thank God for my friends at the univer-
                              sity who invited me to study the Bible with
                              them and become part of their care group. I
                              didn’t know it then, but this group is a Global
                              Mission church plant, supported by donors
                              and mission offerings from people around the
                              world. What a great God we serve, and what a
                              great church family we have. Thank you!

      H
               owever easy to forget, the great controversy between Christ
               and Satan is the ultimate driving force behind reality. Wars,
               crime, violence, and the whole seething and boiling cauldron
      of human tragedy are but surface manifestations of the underlying
      conflict that began in heaven (Rev. 12:7), a universal struggle that
      impacts not just every human but all creation (Rom. 8:20–22).
         One thing, though, we must never forget. The great controversy
      isn’t over Middle East oil or over the epochal geopolitical shifts in the
      military and economic hegemony. It’s over the salvation of the human
      race, one soul at a time. Nations come and go, power structures come
      and go, grand themes of history and ideology come and go; only the
      saved, those covered in the robe of Christ’s righteousness, last for-
      ever. Satan doesn’t care about money, power, politics, not in and of
      themselves—he cares about souls, about taking as many down to ruin
      with him as possible. Christ, through His death, has made it possible
      to save everyone from that ruin. The essence of the great controversy
      is, at the core, people choosing eternal ruin or eternal life. All the rest
      is essentially fluff.

     Zealous for Jerusalem
Read Zechariah 1, 2. Though you might not understand all the
     details and symbols, what is the message the Lord is giving to
     His people here? What is the background to these events? What
     clear biblical principles are seen in these chapters, what promises
     are made, what hope is offered to the Lord’s people, and on what
     conditions? How are these same principles manifested among us
     today, regardless of how different our immediate circumstances
     are in contrast to the situation depicted in Zechariah?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Although Jerusalem lay in ruins because of the conquest of the
     Babylonians 70 years earlier, God provided hope for the future of the
     city. Zechariah received the message from the Lord that not only the
     temple but Jerusalem would be rebuilt.
        Zechariah began by declaring to his listeners that the Lord had
     been displeased, “sore displeased,” with their fathers. But Zechariah
     immediately gave courage to those who were listening by assuring
     them that if they would turn to God in humility and repentance, He
     would turn to them (Zech. 1:1–3). Zechariah’s visions were meant to
     give strength and inspiration to continue the building of the temple in
     Jerusalem for the worship of God.
        Following the first vision of Zechariah, recounted in chapter 1, the
     Lord gave some incredible encouragement, saying, “I am jealous for
     Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy” (vs. 14). 		
        And then this: “ ‘Therefore, this is what the Lord says: “I will return
     to Jerusalem with mercy, and there my house will be rebuilt. And the
     measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem,” declares the
     Lord Almighty’ ” (Zech. 1:16, NIV).
        The man with the measuring line portrayed the plans for the
     rebuilding of the city of Jerusalem and the temple in Zechariah’s time.
     But with only the foundations laid, the building of the temple seemed
     like an impossibility.
        Just before Zechariah’s vision of the filthy garments of Joshua, he
     received a message of promise to communicate to the Jews, recorded
     in Zechariah 2:10–13. God told them to “sing and rejoice,” and then He
     promised to live with them. How encouraging that message must have
     been as the people of God attempted to join together to worship Him.
                                                                           73

     The Accuser and the Accused
       “Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the
     angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right side to accuse
     him” (Zech. 3:1, NIV). What grand and important truths, espe-
     cially in the context of the great controversy (and in the immedi-
     ate context of the vision itself), are revealed here?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        A few crucial points are powerfully represented here. First, who is
     the accused but Joshua, the high priest, who stands as a representa-
     tive of all God’s people. Pictured in this vision as a priest facing the
     Lord, Joshua represents Israel in all their faults, shortcomings, and
     sins. There is no question: the people are not innocent, they are not
     sinless, they are not deserving of the promised restoration that the
     Lord is offering them and which they are claiming for themselves by
     faith and repentance.
        And, of course, Satan is there to accuse them, to argue against their
     repentance, their desire to reform, and their desire to find the mercy
     and grace of God. What better way to discourage people in the great
     controversy than to make them think their sins are just too great for
     the Lord to forgive? How many souls, all through history, and even
     today, have fallen prey to this—one of Satan’s most wicked devices?
     What makes the threat so powerful is that he doesn’t have to lie about
     our sins, does he? All he has to do is remind us of them and, without
     knowing about God’s grace, we would be crushed with a sense of
     hopelessness and loss. Even without an accuser to throw them up in
     God’s face, our sins are more than enough to condemn us.
        The Hebrew verb translated here as “accuse” comes from the same
     word as “Satan”; it’s the same three Hebrew consonants that form the
     foundation for both words. No question, Satan is the accuser, but we all
     should know the famous text: “And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven,
     Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and
     the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down,
     which accused them before our God day and night” (Rev. 12:10).

      Though it is not good to dwell on our sins, at times we need to
      take a hard and honest look at ourselves (regardless of whether
      or not Satan is whispering in our ears). What changes must you
      immediately choose to make in your life, and what Bible promises
      can you claim in order to make those promises real and effective?
      Think of what’s at stake if you allow sin to dominate you.

      The Angel of the Lord
        So far, in Zechariah 3, we’ve focused on two personages, Satan
      and the high priest Joshua. But there’s a third personage, clearly the
      central figure in the narrative: “the Angel of the Lord” (NKJV).

Who is “the Angel of the Lord”? See Exod. 3:2–14, Zech. 3:1, 2. 		
      		       			
      ________________________________________________________

        What we see here, in a graphic form, is a microcosm of the great
      controversy, a battle that is waged over every soul who has given his
      or her life into the hands of Jesus, the Lord, in faith and repentance.
      Remember the context: Israel, severely chastised, “humbled them-
      selves before God, and returned to Him with true repentance.”—Ellen
      G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 468. It was at this
      time that Satan’s work as the accuser was revealed. What exactly
      he said, we aren’t told, but given biblical history and given what we
      know about human nature, it probably wasn’t a pretty picture.

Read Zechariah 3:1–3. What does the reality of Joshua’s garments
      tell us?
      ________________________________________________________
      ________________________________________________________

         The fact that Joshua as the high priest was deemed the one in filthy
      garments only highlights the depth of sin. From the earliest days of the
      covenant between God and Israel, the priesthood as a whole, the Levites,
      and the high priest in particular were special even among the chosen
      nation, called out by the Lord for a unique role and function in Israel, a
      holy role and function (Exod. 38:21, Num. 1:47–53, 3:12). They, of all
      Israel, should have been, symbolically, in the cleanest of garments.
         All that aside, the rest of the chapter makes it clear that, despite
      their past, despite their shortcomings, “the Angel of the Lord” is there
      to defend them against the accusations of Satan, regardless of how
      true or false those accusations are. The Angel of the Lord, Jesus, is
      there to save and redeem. This is, without exception, the most impor-
      tant truth in all Scripture.

       How crucial that we never forget, regardless of our unworthi-
       ness, the role of “the Angel of the Lord” in our behalf. How
       can we keep this truth before us at all times, yet not deceive
       ourselves by drawing false conclusions from it? What might
       some of those false conclusions be? Be prepared to discuss your
       answer in class on Sabbath.
                                                                            75

      Change of Clothes
Read prayerfully and carefully all of Zechariah 3; look at the steps in
      the process. This is how God’s people, though sinners, are saved.
      What can you learn about the plan of salvation through the vision
      here?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         In verses 3–5, before the new clothes are placed on Joshua, the old
      filthy ones are removed. According to the text, that means that the Lord
      has “ ‘removed your iniquity from you’ ” (vs. 4, NKJV). What, though,
      does that mean in the life of the person redeemed? Was Joshua now sin-
      less, perfect in heart and soul and mind, never to fall or sin again? Was
      that the state Joshua had to reach before the change of garments could
      be placed on him? If so, what hope would any of us have?
         Instead, what it means is that the guilt and condemnation that belonged
      to him had been taken away. Talking about Joshua here, Ellen G. White
      said, “His own sins and those of his people were pardoned. Israel were
      clothed with ‘change of raiment’—the righteousness of Christ imputed
      to them. The miter placed upon Joshua’s head was such as was worn by
      the priests and bore the inscription, ‘Holiness to the Lord,’ signifying
      that, notwithstanding his former transgressions, he was now qualified
      to minister before God in His sanctuary.”—Testimonies for the Church,
      vol. 5, p. 469.

What does “the Angel of the Lord” say to Joshua in verse 7 after the
      change of clothes, and why is that order so important?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        It was only after the special clothing was given to him that Joshua
      received the admonition to obey the Lord and walk in His ways.
      This point mustn’t be overlooked­—the righteousness of Christ was
      granted to him by faith, was credited to him apart from his walking in
      “[God’s] ways” or from keeping “[God’s] command.” Without being
      covered in those “ ‘rich robes’ ” (Zech. 3:4, NKJV), all his efforts to
      obey God’s commandments and to keep His “ways” would have left
      him in the same filthy garments he started with.

     “An Effectual Plea”
        In the world of Christianity, many people have not experienced the
     robe of righteousness and do not understand its potential. However,
     this concept is absolutely vital to anyone who wishes for peace and
     joy in his or her relationship with his or her Lord.
        Too often, there’s a motivation to do good so that we can be saved.
     The message here in Zechariah should show us that is not how it
     works, nor how it can work. Again, here’s Ellen G. White on what
     was happening in this vision: “But while we should realize our sinful
     condition, we are to rely upon Christ as our righteousness, our sancti-
     fication, and our redemption. We cannot answer the charges of Satan
     against us. Christ alone can make an effectual plea in our behalf. He is
     able to silence the accuser with arguments founded not upon our mer-
     its, but on His own.”—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 472.
        That last sentence should become emblazoned in the hearts of all
     of God’s people, a truth that we must know not only intellectually but
     experientially, learning to rely moment by moment, not on our good
     works, no matter how good they really are, but only on the merits of
     Christ. Or to put it in David’s words: “Blessed is he whose transgres-
     sion is forgiven, whose sin is covered” (Ps. 32:1).

Keeping what we have seen in Zechariah 3 in mind, read Ephesians
     2:8–10, John 14:15, and Romans 6:1–4. How do these verses help
     us understand all that is involved in what we have been shown in
     Zechariah about what it means to be wearing “rich robes”?

       Now that Joshua was covered in the garments of holiness, his life
     was to reflect that holiness. We are to exert all the God-given power
     offered the soul to have victory over sin. No sin should be tolerated or
     excused in our lives, not when there are so many promises of victory
     for the one who has given himself or herself to Christ. Christ’s life
     proved we can live in obedience to God’s law. When we sin, we are
     choosing to sin. How important that we always think long and hard
     on the implications of that choice.

      What are the sins you especially struggle with? What prom-
      ises can you claim so that you can have the victory over them
      through Christ?

           “When Satan seeks to cover the people of God with blackness, and
         ruin them, Christ interposes. Although they have sinned, Christ has
         taken the guilt of their sins upon His own soul. He has snatched the
         race as a brand from the fire. By His human nature He is linked with
1
         man, while through His divine nature He is one with the infinite God.
         Help is brought within the reach of perishing souls. The adversary is
         rebuked. . . .
           “Notwithstanding the defects of the people of God, Christ does not
         turn away from the objects of His care. He has the power to change
         their raiment. He removes the filthy garments, He places upon the
2
         repenting, believing ones His own robe of righteousness, and writes
         pardon against their names on the records of heaven.”—Ellen G.
         White, Christ’s Object Lessons, pp. 169, 170.
           “As the people of God afflict their souls before Him, pleading
         for purity of heart, the command is given, ‘Take away the filthy
         garments,’ and the encouraging words are spoken, ‘Behold, I have
         caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with
         change of raiment.’ Zechariah 3:4. The spotless robe of Christ’s righ-
3
         teousness is placed upon the tried, tempted, faithful children of God.
         The despised remnant are clothed in glorious apparel, nevermore to be
         defiled by the corruptions of the world.”—Ellen G. White, Prophets
         and Kings, p. 591.

          1 As a class, go over your answers to Tuesday’s final questions.


          l
          2 Dwell more on the fact that it was only after the change of
          garments that Joshua was given the command to obey. Why is
          that so important to remember? What does this tell us about
          what our salvation is based upon, as opposed to what the results
          of that salvation are? Why must we always understand that
          distinction?

          l3 Think of the good news that we can be given a whole new
          change of clothes, regardless of how filthy our garments have
          been. What should that mean to you in your own life, your own
          attitudes, your whole way of looking at the world and others,
          knowing that you have been granted this completely new set of
          clothes, which reveal the new life offered to you in Christ?

Fishers of Men
by Benjamin D. Schoun
   Sri Lanka is a beautiful island that lies in the warm waters of the Indian
Ocean, off the southern tip of India. For 30 years the nation was wracked
by civil war, but at last peace has come, and the people can once more
hope for a better life. Farmers can plant their rice crops without fear, and
men can go fishing in the rich waters that surround their island.
   But another threat has risen, a threat to religious freedom. Recently
the government of Sri Lanka has passed a law forbidding religious con-
versions. Now anyone caught distributing religious material risks being
convicted of a crime. How can the 3,600 Seventh-day Adventists living
on this island share God’s love with others without risking their lives,
their jobs, and their future? How can they invite people, as Jesus did, to
“follow Me”?
   Two brothers who make their living fishing in the sea near their home
bought a small radio to listen to as they sit for long hours in their boat.
One day while searching for something of interest to listen to, they came
across a station they hadn’t heard before. It was a message of hope, a
message of God’s love.
   Day after day they listened to programs on this newly discovered sta-
tion, which identified itself as Adventist World Radio. They responded
to the messages of hope and peace and accepted Jesus as their personal
Savior.
   They shared what they were learning with their families, and during the
long hours out in their boat, these brothers turned up the volume on their
little radio so that the men fishing nearby could enjoy the message, as
well. Their favorite program was called The Voice of Hope, and the words
of hope warmed the hearts of many who listened as they fished.
   As fellow fishers asked the brothers questions, the new believers grew
bold. They organized a prayer group, and several who have come have
found hope and life in the gospel of Jesus. Now, in spite of the new legal
restrictions, these men ask for literature and Bibles so they can study and
grow in their faith and knowledge of Jesus.
   Please pray for these modern-day fishers of men and all the believers
in Sri Lanka and elsewhere in the world where the devil seeks to slow the
Lord’s work. Your mission offerings help support the work in difficult
places.

      The Prodigal’s New
      Clothes


      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 4:1–8; 25:25–34; Luke
      15:4–32; John 11:9, 10; Rom. 5:12–20.

Memory Text: “ ‘ “But we had to celebrate and be glad, because
      this brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and
      is found” ’ ” (Luke 15:32, NIV).



      W
                  . Somerset Maugham wrote a short story called “Rain”
                  about a missionary in the South Seas who “converted” a
                  prostitute to the gospel. He poured himself, heart and soul,
      into seeking to win her, though at times his methods seemed harsh and
      unforgiving. In fact, he insisted that she return to the United States
      (from which she was fleeing) in order to finish out a jail sentence, all
      despite her desperate pleas to spare her from the torture, degradation,
      and ignominy that awaited her in prison. Doing her jail time, the mis-
      sionary insisted, was just part of the process of repentance that she
      needed to go through, and thus she had to return.
         The story ended, however, unexpectedly. The missionary killed
      himself, his mangled corpse found washed up on the beach. What
      happened? Apparently, spending all this time with the prostitute, he
      fell into sin with her and, unable to forgive himself—he killed himself
      instead.
         What those characters needed was what we all as sinners need—a
      personal experience of the grace and assurance that Jesus revealed in
      the parable of the prodigal son.

     Same Parents, Same Food		
        “ ‘There was a man who had two sons’ ” (Luke 15:11, NIV). In this
     parable, the two sons born to the same father represent two character
     traits. The older son apparently demonstrated loyalty, perseverance,
     and industry. The younger one was, no doubt, unwilling to work,
     unwilling to be accountable, and unwilling to take his share of respon-
     sibility. Both were from the same heritage. Both probably received
     identical love and commitment from the same father. One son was, it
     seemed, faithful; one was disrespectful. What caused the difference?

What other stories does this remind you of? Gen. 4:1–8, 25:25–34.

     ________________________________________________________

        It’s a strange phenomenon, is it not, one that is seen all the time.
     Two (or more) siblings from the same parents, living in the same
     home, have the same teachings, the same love, the same food even,
     and one becomes spiritual, faithful, and determined to serve the Lord,
     while the other, for whatever reason, goes in the opposite direction.
     However hard to understand, it does show us the powerful reality of
     free will. Some might see something significant in the fact that it was
     the younger of the two brothers who rebelled, but who knows the
     reason why he did what he did?

Read Luke 15:12. What lesson can we learn from how the father
     reacted to the son’s request? What does that tell us about how
     God relates to us?

     ________________________________________________________

        The text does not say what kind of dialogue ensued between the
     father and the son or whether the father remonstrated with him, asking
     him to reconsider, asking him not to be so rash, asking him to think
     through his actions. Most likely he did, but in the end, the son was given
     the “portion of the goods” that were his, and off he went. All through
     the Bible, we can see this same principle: God allows human beings the
     freedom to make their own choices, to go their own way, and to live as
     they want. Of course, as we all know so well, our choices come with
     consequences, consequences that we don’t always imagine or foresee.

      What have been the results of some of your own free choices
      lately? Not so easy to turn back the clock, is it?

                                                                           81

     Spreading His Wings
       Picture the father as he watched his emboldened son put things
     together in his backpack, ready to leave home. Maybe he asked his son
     where he was going, what his plan was for employment, or what his
     dreams were for his future. Who knows what answers the son gave.
     They probably weren’t encouraging, at least to the father. The son,
     meanwhile, was more than likely ready for the good times ahead.
       After all, why not? He was young and adventurous, had some cash
     to spend and a world to see. Life on the family farm probably seemed
     dull and boring in contrast to all the possibilities that the world pre-
     sented to him.

Read Luke 15:13–19. What kind of repentance do we see here? Does
     it seem like a true repentance, that he’s sorry for what he did, or
     that he is sorry only for the consequences of what he did? What
     hints are there in the verses that could give us the answer?
     ________________________________________________________
     ________________________________________________________

        It’s hard to know how this story might have turned out had things
     gone well for the prodigal. Suppose he found ways to keep the money
     flowing in and to keep the good times coming? It’s not likely, at least
     from what we see here, that he would have been coming back “on his
     knees,” is it? Who among us, at times, hasn’t been really sorry, not so
     much for our sins but for the consequences of them, especially when
     we get caught? Even the hardest pagan is going to be sorry he commit-
     ted adultery if, in the process, he picked up herpes, gonorrhea, or some
     other sexually transmitted disease. There’s nothing Christian about sor-
     row for the pain that comes from our wrong choices, is there?
        What, then, about this young man? Though there’s no question the
     terrible circumstances he found himself in brought about a changed
     attitude that might not have otherwise occurred, the thoughts of his
     heart, as revealed in the texts, do reveal a sense of true humility and a
     realization of the fact that he sinned both against his father and against
     God. The speech he prepared in his heart did seem to show the sincer-
     ity of his repentance.

      Sometimes we need the bad consequences of our actions to
      awaken us to the reality of our sins, don’t we? That is, only
      after the suffering comes from our actions do we truly repent of
      those actions and not just from the results. What about yourself
      and whatever situations you’re facing now? Why not choose to
      avoid the sin and spare yourself all the sorrow and the repen-
      tance that (one hopes) will follow?

      You Can Go Home Again
        In the early part of the twentieth century, novelist Thomas Wolfe
      wrote a literary classic, You Can’t Go Home Again, about a man who
      leaves his humble family origins in the south, goes to New York,
      makes it big as a writer, and then seeks to return to his roots. It wasn’t
      an easy transition; hence the title of the book.

In the story of the prodigal, who is the one who makes the long jour-
      ney in order to be reunited with his father? Contrast that to, for
      instance, the parable of the lost sheep and lost coin (Luke 15:4–10).
      What might be the important difference here?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         Perhaps, in the two other parables, the lost objects didn’t even know
      that they were lost (certainly the case with the coin), and they couldn’t
      make it back even if they tried; whereas, in the case of the prodigal,
      he walked away from the “truth,” as it were, and it was only after he
      was in the darkness (see John 11:9, 10) that he realized just how lost
      he was. All through salvation history, God has had to deal with those
      who, having light, have purposely turned away from that light and
      gone their own way. The good news of this parable is that, even in
      the cases of those who turned their backs on Him after knowing His
      goodness and love, God is still willing to restore them to the position
      that they once held in His covenant family. Though, just as the young
      man chose of his own free will to leave, he had to choose by his own
      free will to come back. It works the same way with all of us.
         What’s interesting, too, about these parables is the context in which
      they are being told. Read Luke 15:1, 2. Look at the different people
      who are listening to what Jesus is saying. What a powerful message
      it should be to us all that, instead of giving warnings about end-time
      apocalyptic events or about doom and judgment upon the unrepentant,
      Jesus gives parables showing the Father’s earnest love and care for all
      of those who are lost, regardless of the situation that led to their being
      in that position.

       Have you known people who have walked away from God?
       What hope can you take from this story that all is not lost? How
       important that we all pray for those who still haven’t learned
       the lesson that the prodigal so painfully did.



                                                                            83

     The Best Robe
       			
       As we saw, the son himself had to make the decision to return.
     There was no compulsion on his father’s part. God forces no one
     to be obedient; if He didn’t force Satan to be obedient in heaven or
     Adam and Eve to be obedient in Eden, why do it now, long after the
     consequences of disobedience have wreaked havoc on humanity?
     (Rom. 5:12–20, 21).

Read Luke 15:20–24. How does the father react to the son’s confes-
     sion? How much penance, how many works, how many acts of
     restitution was the son required to do before the father accepted
     him? What message is in there for us? See also Jer. 31:17–20.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        The son did confess to his father, but you can get the impression from
     reading the text that the father almost didn’t hear it. Look at the order:
     the father ran to meet his son, fell on him, and kissed him. Sure, the con-
     fession was fine, and it probably did the son more good than the father,
     but at that point the son’s actions spoke louder than his words.
        The father, too, told the servants to bring “the best robe” and place
     it on the son. The Greek word translated “best” (from protos) often
     means “first” or “foremost.” The father was giving him the best he
     had to offer.
        Think of the context, too: the son had been living in poverty for
     who knows how long. He probably didn’t come home dressed in the
     finest of apparel, to say the least. After all, he had been feeding pigs
     up until then. The contrast, no doubt, between what he was wearing
     when he was embraced by his father (notice, too, the father didn’t wait
     until he was cleaned up before throwing himself on him) and the robe
     that was placed on him couldn’t have been starker.
        What this shows, among other things, is that the restoration, at least
     between the father and the son, was at that moment complete. If we
     see “the best robe” as the robe of Christ’s righteousness, then all that
     was needed was provided for right then and there. The prodigal had
     repented, confessed, and turned from his ways. The father supplied
     the rest. If that’s not a symbol of salvation, what is?

      What’s fascinating here, too, is that there is no “I told you so”
      from the father. There wasn’t any need for it, was there? Sin
      reaps its own wages. When dealing with people who come back
      to the Lord after falling away, how can we learn not to throw
      their sins up before them?

      The Father’s Own Garment
         Ellen G. White, in Christ’s Object Lessons, pages 203, 204, adds an
      interesting detail to the story that’s not found in the texts themselves.
      Describing the scene of the father approaching the son as he humbly
      comes home, she writes, “The father will permit no contemptuous
      eye to mock at his son’s misery and tatters. He takes from his own
      shoulders the broad, rich mantle, and wraps it around the son’s wasted
      form, and the youth sobs out his repentance, saying, ‘Father, I have
      sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be
      called thy son.’ The father holds him close to his side, and brings him
      home. No opportunity is given him to ask a servant’s place. He is a
      son, who shall be honored with the best the house affords, and whom
      the waiting men and women shall respect and serve.
         “The father said to his servants, ‘Bring forth the best robe, and put
      it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet; and bring
      hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat and be merry; for this
      my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And
      they began to be merry.’ ” 		

What insights does this reference give us into the story as a whole,
      and what does it tell us about God’s character?
      ________________________________________________________
      ________________________________________________________

        The father wants, right away, to cover up the shame of the son’s
      mistakes. What a message for us about learning to let the past go, to not
      dwell on others’ past mistakes or our own. Some of the worst sins are
      not known now, but one day will be (1 Cor. 4:5); like Paul, we need to
      forget what’s past and press toward the future (Phil. 3:13, 14).

Read Luke 15:24. What does the father mean when he says that his
      son was dead but is alive again? How are we to understand those
      very strong words?
      ________________________________________________________
      ________________________________________________________
      ________________________________________________________
         In the end, there’s no middle ground in the ultimate issues of salva-
      tion. When all things finally and totally wrap up (Rev. 21:5), and the
      great controversy is ended, all human beings either will be eternally
      alive or eternally dead. There’s nothing in between.
         Certainly something to think about as we make our daily choices,
      both good and bad, as did the prodigal son.
                                                                            85

         cover his rags; the ring is placed upon his finger as a token of his
         royalty. And yet how many there are who look upon the prodigal not
         only with indifference, but with contempt. Like the Pharisee, they say,
         ‘God, I thank Thee, that I am not as other men’ (Luke 18:11). But

         stubborn, self-willed, selfish?”—Ellen G. White, Gospel Workers,

         Jesus, who died for them. He is waiting to strip them of their garments
         stained and polluted with sin, and to put upon them the white robes

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Discuss more the question of how siblings from the same par-
          ents, the same home, and the same environment can go in such
          different spiritual directions. How are we to understand that?

          l
          2 How do you help those who—having turned away from the
          Lord, gone into the world, and damaged themselves and others
          in the process—want to put their past behind them but can’t,
          because no matter which way they turn, the results of their past
          choices stare them right in the face? What hope, what promises,
          or what help can you give them?

          l
          3 It’s one thing to know that you are messed up, as did the
          prodigal. What about those who have “left their father’s home,”
          so to speak, and things are going quite well for them? Let’s be
          honest: not everyone who leaves the Lord winds up feeding pigs.
          Some end up owning the pig farm! What can be done to help
          them realize that, despite their circumstances, they have made
          a fatal choice?

Finding Faith
by Sonia Somuah Asante
   I grew up in Ghana. When I was 17, I went to live with my aunt, for
my mother left Ghana to work in another country. We were Christians
but not Seventh-day Adventists. A friend was studying at Valley View
University, the Adventist university in Ghana. She suggested that I com-
plete my high school studies at the university so I could qualify for admis-
sion to the university. I knew the school was a Christian institution, but I
knew nothing about Adventists. I decided to apply to study there.
   I was surprised to learn that we had worship every evening in the dor-
mitory and attended church on Saturday. I wondered what strange people
these Adventists were. I didn’t mind the dormitory worships, but it was
hard to start going to church on Saturdays. For me religion was a Sunday
activity.
   At first I worried that I was disobeying God’s will by going to church on
Saturday. But my friends helped me understand that Saturday was God’s
chosen day of rest, not Sunday. They helped me understand the principles
behind other practices of Adventists too.
   During a Week of Spiritual Emphasis, the pastor invited students to
surrender their lives entirely to God. I responded to his call. I studied the
Bible with some friends, and in time I was baptized, along with more than
50 other students.
   My mother accepted my decision, but my aunt worried that I had joined
a cult. During my next school break, I returned home to talk to her about
my new faith. She was convinced that the Seventh-day Adventist Church
is a cult, not a church.
   I graduated from high school and enrolled as a university student at
Valley View University. I pray that my family will want to know more
about my new faith and will understand what I believe. I want to see them
in the Adventist church one day.
   Your mission offerings help support Valley View University and many
other schools around the world. Last year part of a Thirteenth Sabbath
Offering went to help the university build a new church on campus. Thank
you for all you’ve done to make it possible for me to study at an Adventist
university, where students like me can find Christ or develop a deeper
faith while we’re still young.




Sonia Somuah Asante is in her final year of studies at Valley View University near Accra,
Ghana.

      The Wedding Garment




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Matthew 21; 22:1–14; Rev.
  21:2, 9; Eccles. 12:14; Dan. 7:10; Gen. 3:9–19.
    			
Memory Text: “There is therefore now no condemnation to them

      C
              hristian history is full of dark pages. Horrible things have
              been done by professed followers of Christ, and according to
              our understanding of prophecy, more evil will be done in His
      name, too, before Jesus returns.
        This week we’ll look at a fascinating parable, a parable that reveals
      the painful truth that not all who profess to be followers of Christ
      really are. Of course, who are we to make the judgment between the
      faithful and the unfaithful? Who are we to behold the “mote that is
      in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own
      eye?” (Matt. 7:3). We don’t make that judgment. But God does.
        “The guests at the gospel feast are those who profess to serve God,
      those whose names are written in the book of life. But not all who
      profess to be Christians are true disciples. Before the final reward is
      given, it must be decided who are fitted to share the inheritance of
      the righteous. This decision must be made prior to the second coming
      of Christ in the clouds of heaven; for when He comes, His reward is
      with Him, ‘to give every man according as his work shall be.’ Rev.
      22:12.”—Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 310.

     Days of Fervor
        				
        Matthew 21, recounting some of the last days of Jesus’ earthly
     ministry, is filled with drama, tension, and excitement. It also reveals,
     as the Bible often does, the fearful ability of our hearts to deceive us
     and the power of the evil one to blind our minds to the most obvious
     truths. It’s easy for us, looking back, to think, How could those lead-
     ers have been so hard, so blind, so indignant in the face of all the
     evidence that Jesus had given them?
        Yet, we mustn’t fool ourselves. Is there any reason to think—even
     as Seventh-day Adventists, living with so much light—that we are
     much different? Do we not, at times, show a hard and callous indif-
     ference to truth, particularly when it interferes with our pet sins and
     desires and worldliness? Sure, God loves us, Christ died for us, and
     forgiveness is available to all. But those same words could be said
     about the people in this chapter, as well, the ones who not only turned
     their backs on Jesus but worked against Him. How careful we need
     to be, for we deceive ourselves if we think that we can’t be deceived
     as well.

Read through Matthew 21, which forms the background for the
     parable in the next chapter. Though so much is happening there,
     what is the basic theme of the chapter? That is, if you had to write
     a summary of it in a few lines, what would it be? More important,
     what spiritual lessons can we take from it for ourselves?

     ________________________________________________________

        Perhaps the most fascinating lines in the entire chapter are the last
     two. No matter how hard the people’s hearts were to Jesus, something of
     His message must have gotten through, because they knew He had been
     talking about them. It would have been one thing had they completely
     missed His point, but they didn’t. That was the problem; they seemed to
     have understood it, at least well enough to want to get Jesus out of the
     way. How fascinating, too, that it was the people themselves, the Jewish
     crowds drawn to Jesus, who restrained the leaders from arresting Him
     then. How sad—those who should have been teachers of others were
     the ones who had the most to learn and, in many cases, never learned it.
     When they finally do, it will be too late (Rom. 14:10).
                                                                          89

     The King’s Invitation
       It’s one thing to have a wedding. It’s another thing for a king to have
     a wedding. And to be invited to a wedding put on by a king for his
     own son would have been a very high honor indeed. The wedding
     imagery there, particularly of the son, is, of course, an obvious refer-
     ence to the relationship between Jesus and His church (Rev. 21:2, 9;
     Eph. 5:21–23).

Read Matthew 22:1–8. How does this part of the parable fit in
     with what we saw in the preceding chapter? What same theme
     appears?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Notice, too, how all the preparations were done by the king: he
     arranged for the marriage, he prepared the dinner, and he had the
     animals slain. Indeed, “all things are ready: come unto the marriage”
     was the message. In the end, all that the people had to do was accept
     what was offered them.
        Notice, too, the things that caused the people to scorn the invitation.
     Some made light of it; that is, they just didn’t take it seriously, didn’t
     think it mattered, didn’t think it important. That could symbolize
     those today who just don’t take the claims of God seriously, who, for
     various reasons, never open themselves up to truth. Others “went their
     ways.” Jesus said that the path to salvation is narrow (Matt. 7:14);
     people can find all sorts of excuses to avoid and reject the invitation.
     For others, it was simply the lure of material things. And finally,
     while some just ignored the invitation, others actually persecuted
     those who gave it. Whatever the reason, they all were left out.
        Think, too, about the words of the king, saying that those who had
     rejected the invitation “were not worthy.” How do we understand that,
     in light of the universality of all human sin and sinfulness? Are any of
     us really worthy to be invited to the king’s feast? In the end, as we’ll
     see, “worthiness” in the biblical sense comes from what Christ does
     for us; our worthiness is not in ourselves but in what we allow God to
     do for us—and in us.

      Of the reasons given above for those who rejected the invita-
      tion, which one do you find the most difficult to deal with in
      your own life? What promises can you claim that will enable
      you to resist it?

     Those Who Came to the Feast
       With the rejection of two calls, the king now sent out another one,
     this time to “as many as ye shall find” (Matt. 22:9), and ordered
     his servants to invite them to the wedding. This time, however, the
     reception was different, because, according to the text, they went out
     and “gathered together all as many as they found” (Matt. 22:10).

Read the rest of the parable (Matt. 22:9–14). Who were the ones who
     came to the wedding feast? What does it mean that some who
     came were “both bad and good”?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       Have you ever noticed that some of the meanest, nastiest, and most
     hateful people are professed Christians? Or that some of the most
     judgmental, condemnatory, hypocritical, and downright evil people
     are those who go to church, who claim the promises of salvation, and
     who profess assurance of salvation?
       This is nothing new. How do we understand, for instance, the faith
     of the Crusaders, so dedicated to the Lord Jesus that they pillaged and
     plundered their way to the Holy Land? One eyewitness reported that
     “our troops boiled pagan adults in cooking pots. They impaled chil-
     dren on spits and devoured them grilled.” How could those horrors
     have been done in the name of Jesus?
       It’s easy (you say): these people weren’t real Christians. But
     how do you know? How can you judge their hearts, what they were
     taught, what opportunities they had to know better? Might not some
     have later repented, claiming the same promises of forgiveness and
     grace that we do? What about the horrendous acts of those who
     turned out to be, it seems, pretty pious souls? Who are we to judge
     hearts?
       We shouldn’t judge—but God does, should, and will (Rom. 14:10;
     Heb. 10:30; Eccles. 12:14; Dan. 7:9, 10). Seventh-day Adventists
     call it the “investigative judgment,” and it is revealed in this par-
     able.

      Think through some of the things that have been done by pro-
      fessed Christians through history, sometimes in the name of
      Jesus too. How does this parable help us understand how God
      will deal justly with them?

What does the garment represent in the parable? Why should rejec-
     tion of it be literally a matter of eternal life or death?

          Unless one believes in once saved always saved, then what is the
     problem with the idea that God, at some point in history, ultimately
     and finally separates the wheat from the tares (Matt. 13:24–30), the
     wise from the foolish (Matt. 25:1–13), the faithful from the unfaithful
     (Matt. 25:14–30), and those who are truly covered in His righteous-
     ness and those who aren’t (Matt. 22:1–14) from among those who
     have professed to follow Him, especially when some of them have
     done, and might still do, horrible things, maybe even in His name
     too?
       Will there not be some kind of final reckoning among the true and
     the false who claim the same promises of salvation that we always
     do, especially in a religion whose basis is that you are saved by what
     Someone else has done for you?
       Think it through, if salvation were purely by our works—it would be
     easy; just tally up our works. Either they add up or they don’t. Period.
     But in a faith where salvation rests on the merits of what Someone
     else has done for us, a faith in which the righteousness needed for
     salvation exists in Someone other than ourselves, the issue gets more
     subtle, more nuanced. Hence, a judgment by One who never makes
     a mistake would seem more necessary here than in a religion where
     works are the standard, would it not?
       And that is what this parable is all about—God separating the true
     and false from among those who have professed to follow Him. And
     what is the deciding factor? Whether or not they have been clothed in
     the wonderful garment of righteousness that Christ has freely offered
     to all.

      This parable draws a significant distinction between being a
      member of a church and being a sinner saved by the righteous-
      ness of Christ. They clearly aren’t the same thing, are they?
      Look at your life, your deeds, your actions, your words, your
      thoughts, and your attitude toward friends and enemies. Do
      they reflect someone wearing Christ’s robe of righteousness or
      someone who has just come to the feast?

     The Investigation				
        		
        As expressed yesterday, unless you believe that once a person is
     “saved,” that person can never fall away, it’s hard to imagine that
     God wouldn’t have a final separation between those clothed in His
     righteousness and those just claiming to be. That’s essentially what
     this parable is about. Again, for a religion based not on our own works
     but on Someone else’s works for us (which we claim by faith), how
     could there not be this final divine separation?

Read Ecclesiastes 12:14 and 1 Corinthians 4:5 in light of Matthew
     22:11. What’s the one point that they have in common, and why
     is that important?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        As Seventh-day Adventists, with our understanding of the great
     controversy (Rev. 12:7–9, 1 Pet. 5:8, Job 1, 2) and the interest of the
     entire universe in this great controversy (Dan. 7:10, 1 Cor. 4:9, Eph.
     3:10), we easily can reject the argument—taken from 2 Timothy 2:19,
     “the Lord knoweth them that are his”—used against the idea that an
     investigation of works is biblical. The Lord does know those that are
     His, but the rest of the universe, ourselves included, don’t.
        It’s so important that we keep the big picture in mind: the interest of the
     whole universe in what is going on here with sin, rebellion, salvation, and
     God’s plan to deal with everything in an open, just, and fair way.
        The very idea of a judgment of any kind presupposes some kind of
     investigation, does it not? Look at Genesis 3:9–19; from the first moment
     after sin entered, God Himself got directly involved, asking questions
     to answers that He already knew. Just as this “investigation” wasn’t for
     Himself (it helped Adam and Eve understand the gravity of what they
     had done), the same can be said of the investigative judgment: it doesn’t
     reveal anything new to God; it’s for the benefit of others.
        Just as in this Genesis judgment, where God’s grace overruled the
     death sentence (see Gen. 3:15), His grace does the same for all of God’s
     true followers, now and in the judgment—when they need it the most!

      An investigation of your works? Is there any wonder that you
      need to have Christ’s righteousness covering you at all times or
      that salvation has to be by grace and not by works? What hope
      would you have if—when all your works were investigated—
      you didn’t have Christ’s robe covering you?

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Without a Wedding Garment,”
         pp. 307–319, in Christ’s Object Lessons.

           “But the plan of redemption had a yet broader and deeper purpose
         than the salvation of man. It was not for this alone that Christ came
         to the earth; it was not merely that the inhabitants of this little world
         might regard the law of God as it should be regarded; but it was to
         vindicate the character of God before the universe.”—Ellen G. White,
1
         Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 68.
           “Yet Satan was not then destroyed. The angels did not even then
         understand all that was involved in the great controversy. The prin-
         ciples at stake were to be more fully revealed. And for the sake of
         man, Satan’s existence must be continued. Man as well as angels must
         see the contrast between the Prince of light and the prince of darkness.
2
         He must choose whom he will serve.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire
         of Ages, p. 761.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Think about Christian history. Think about all the horrible
          things done by professed Christians, and often in the name of
          Jesus too. Think how people have used their faith as cover, a
3         cloak, a justification for some horrific crimes. How does this
          unfortunate fact help us better understand the need for the kind
          of separation among the professed followers of Jesus, as revealed
          in this parable and in other Bible texts?

          l2 Ellen G. White makes it clear that Christ’s robe represents
          the righteousness of Jesus that not only covers, or justifies, us
          but also changes us into His image and allows us to reflect His
          character in our lives. How are we to understand the differences
          between these two essential truths, and why is it important that
          we do?

          l3 Reflect upon the reality of the great controversy and how
          much it impacts and influences our theology as Seventh-day
          Adventists. Go through the Bible and pull together all the texts
          you can find that show just how biblical and important this
          theme is.

          l4 Jesus ended the parable of the wedding garment with these
          words: “For many are called, but few are chosen” (Matt. 22:14).
          What do you think He meant by that statement, given the con-
          text of the parable?

The Balite Tree
by Bony Lagunday
   The Manobo people of Togopon village in the southern Philippines
wanted to relocate their village. They found a site that had plenty of safe
water and enough land for houses and gardens. The site was perfect except
for one thing: a balite, or banyan, tree grew nearby, and some villagers
believed that the tree was home to spirits. Some said that they heard a
baby cry near the tree. Others smelled food cooking when they passed the
tree. The witch doctor predicted that a disaster would wipe out the village
if they moved to the area where this tree grew.
   I am one of two student missionary teachers in this village. Some Seventh-
day Adventist members told us about the problem and asked our advice.
Should they move the village to the new site or find another location?
   We prayed and then told the believers, “Satan is real; he is seeking to
deceive people. But God has defeated Satan, who trembles when he hears
the weakest child of God pray. We have nothing to fear as long as we trust
God to cover us with His care.”
   The villagers moved to the new site. Some villagers heard strange
sounds coming from the balite tree; others noted that some children had
gotten sick. Even I felt something strange.
   One day I saw a new student in my classroom, a student I didn’t recog-
nize. The other children didn’t seem to see this new student. After class
this new student warned me not to stay in this village or something bad
would happen to me. Then, in a blink, the mysterious student disappeared.
Later I saw him near the balite tree.
   That night I couldn’t sleep. I thought of my late father and my grand-
mother, both of whom had been witch doctors in the village of my birth.
Could the devil’s curse still be on me? Then I reminded myself that I am
now God’s child, and God won the victory over Satan before this world
was created. I talked to my teammate, and we prayed that God would show
the villagers that He truly is God and that they have nothing to fear.
   The tree continued to disturb the villagers, so someone suggested that
they cut it down. But the people feared that the person who cut the tree
down would die. So I took the ax, prayed, then cut down the tree. No harm
came to any of the villagers. “The God of the student missionary teachers
is a powerful God!” the people declared.
   Please pray that the people of Togopon will grow in their faith. And
thank you for your mission offerings that help train me and other young
Adventists for service in difficult places around the world.

Bony Lagunday is a student at Mountain View College in the southern Philippines.

          n one sense, it shouldn’t be all that surprising that we can glean
          so many lessons from clothing in the Bible, should it? After all,
          clothing is so much a part of us; clothing can say a lot about us
      and who we are, even when no voice is heard. Rightly or wrongly, we
      often make judgments about others by what they wear or how they
      wear it.
        This week’s lesson will look at the question of clothing, all in the
      context of Jesus. We’ll explore the woman who believed, rightly so,
      that all she had to do was touch His clothes, and she would be healed.
      Then there’s Jesus, laying aside His garment in order to wash the
      feet of His disciples. Next we’ll look at the high priest who, stand-
      ing before the Lord, rent his own garments in an act that sealed the
      haughty ruler’s doom. Then there’s Jesus in the garments of mockery,
      put on Him by the Roman soldiers. And finally, we’ll look at the
      soldiers casting lots for Christ’s garment, thus fulfilling an ancient
      prophecy.
        Just clothing, yes, yet full of symbolism and meaning, for sure.

     “Who Touched My Clothes?”
        Mark 5:24–34 and Luke 8:43–48 tell the story of the woman who
     had “an issue of blood twelve years.” Besides being a dangerous
     medical condition in and of itself, this sickness in that culture came
     with the stigma of ritual uncleanliness, as well, no doubt adding to her
     misery. Meanwhile, the doctors could do nothing; she was so desper-
     ate that she spent all her money on them, and yet, she became only
     sicker, which isn’t surprising considering the kind of medical treat-
     ments done back then. We barely can imagine how much suffering
     and shame she endured because of her ailment.
        And then comes Jesus, the One who is doing all these incredible
     miracles.

Read Mark 5:24–34 and Luke 8:43–48. What significance can be
     found in the fact that the woman believed all she had to do was
     touch Jesus’ garment to find healing?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        This woman had a great deal of faith in Jesus, enough to believe
     that if she could touch even His clothes, she would be healed. Of
     course, it wasn’t the clothes themselves that healed her—not even the
     touch. It was only the power of God working in someone who, out of
     desperation, came to the Lord in faith, aware of her own helplessness
     and need. Her touching His clothes was faith revealed in works, which
     is what Christianity is all about.

Why would Jesus ask who touched His garment?

     ________________________________________________________

        By asking the question and making the woman’s act and healing
     public, Jesus used her to help witness to those around Him. He certainly
     wanted others to know what happened, and He probably wanted her, too,
     to know that it wasn’t any magical power in His clothes that brought her
     healing but the power of God working in her through the act of faith on
     her part. However embarrassing her condition had been, she now was
     healed and could give witness to what Christ had wrought in her.

      How can we learn to come to the Lord, as did this woman, in
      faith and submission, aware of our own helplessness? More so,
      how can we maintain faith and trust in Him when the healing
      that we ask for doesn’t come as we want it to?
                                                                         97

     He “Laid Aside His Garments”
        In the last few days of Christ’s life on earth, He met with His dis-
     ciples in the upper room for the Passover, Israel’s national celebration
     of the Exodus from bondage and slavery. Yet, all was not well. The
     atmosphere in the upper room must have been thick with tension and
     ill will. Not much earlier, the disciples had been fighting over who
     would have the highest place in heaven (Matt. 18:1–5). Now they had
     come together to celebrate the Passover, which should have spoken to
     them of their great need of God’s saving grace in their lives and how
     dependent they were on Him.

Read Matthew 20:20–28. What important lesson had the disciples
     totally failed to grasp, even after all this time with Jesus?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       As if the disciples’ attitudes hadn’t been bad enough, to top it all off
     there was Judas, His betrayer, acting as if nothing were wrong. In the
     midst of all this, when Jesus had every right to be disgusted with the
     whole lot of them, what does He do?

Read John 13:1–16. What lesson is Jesus giving here? Why is this in
     so many ways key to what it means to be a follower of Jesus?

      ________________________________________________________

       It was the custom for the disciples to make provisions for washing
     the filth of the streets from their feet. This was a servant’s work. But
     the disciples had no servants. And none of them would stoop to this
     humiliating and menial task. As Jesus took off His outer garment and
     began to wash their feet, their hearts melted. They had declared Him
     to be the Son of God. That God’s Son should stoop to do the work
     of a slave shamed them. The text said that before doing this, He took
     off His outer garment, showing His willingness to lower Himself and
     humble Himself to whatever degree was needed in order to reach His
     followers.
        And then, if all that wasn’t enough, knowing full well what was in
     Judas’s heart, He washed Judas’s feet, as well.

      How “low” are you willing to go for the good of others? When
      was the last time you “took off your outer garment” in order to
      minister to the needs of those around you?

     “Nor Rend His Clothes”
       “And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose
     head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put
     on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes”
     (Lev. 21:10).

Read Matthew 26:59–68. What can we read into the high priest’s
     rending of his garments in response to Christ’s answer to him?
     See also Mark 15:38, Heb. 8:1.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       The high priest rent his clothes to symbolize that Jesus was to be put
     to death. Tearing his garments symbolized Caiaphas’s righteous indig-
     nation and signified his horror over Jesus’ allegedly blasphemous claim
     to be the Son of God. Mosaic law forbade the high priest from tearing
     his ecclesiastical clothes (Lev. 10:6, 21:10), because his garments sym-
     bolized the perfection of God’s character. To tear those robes would be
     to profane God’s character, to mar its perfection. Thus, the irony was
     that Caiaphas was guilty of breaking the very law he defended. It made
     him unfit for his office. More sobering than that, the penalty for tearing
     his garments was death. The great irony in all this was that Jesus, who
     had done nothing wrong, was to be put to death at the instigation of the
     very priest who, through his actions, deserved death.
       The symbolism of that rending was profound. This was the begin-
     ning of the end of the entire earthly sacrificial system and priesthood.
     A new and better one was soon to be inaugurated, with Christ as the
     new High Priest ministering in the sanctuary in heaven.
       The clothes of the earthly high priest, so full of symbolism and
     significance in their time, were soon to become symbols of a system
     that was now devoid of all meaning and about to end. How terrible
     that the religious leaders were so blinded by hatred, jealousy, and
     fear that when Christ came—the One to whom their whole religion
     pointed—many of these leaders (but not all) missed Him, and it was
     the common people who accepted Jesus as the Messiah and took up
     the work that these priests should have been doing.

      In what ways could we be so caught up in our own sense of self-
      righteousness, our own sense of moral and spiritual superiority,
      that we could be blind to the important truths that the Lord
      wants us to learn?
                                                                           99

      Garments of Mockery
         “Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common
      hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers. And they
      stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe. And when they had
      platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in
      his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked
      him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!” (Matt. 27:27–29). Think
      about what is happening in these verses. What terrible irony do
      you see? What do these verses tell us about human ignorance, cru-
      elty, and foolishness? How do these verses, in their own dramatic
      way, symbolize what the world does to its Creator and Redeemer,
      even today? See also Luke 23:10, 11; Mark 15:17–20.

         Jesus was stripped and garbed in a scarlet or purple robe. This
      robe could have been a soldier’s cloak or one of Pilate’s old cast-off
      garments. Purple was the color of royalty. This robe was thrown in
      mockery around the shoulders of the Man who claimed to be King.
         Of course, no king is complete without his crown. Jesus’ torment-
      ers fashioned Him one of thorns, from the sharp shrubs growing in
      the region of Palestine, and placed in His hands a reed in imitation
      of a royal scepter. They bowed to Him in mockery, hailing Him as
      King of the Jews. But whereas the priests’ mockery consisted of an
      attack on Christ’s spiritual authority, the soldiers mocked His political
      sovereignty. The true King was paraded around in a mock ceremony,
      wearing mock garments. He who offered to clothe a sinful world in
      His own garments of righteousness and perfection was now clothed
      in the garments of mockery.
         And yet, the incredible thing is that Jesus endured this, at least in
      part, because of His love for those who were treating Him this way.
      How many of us, the moment anyone treats us badly or even looks
      at us crossly, react with anger and seek to fight back? Look, though,
      at the example Jesus leaves us here regarding how He responded to
      this treatment.

       How do you respond when treated unfairly? What can you take
       from His example that could help you deal differently the next
       time it happens?

     “They Parted My Garments”
       “They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my
     vesture” (Ps. 22:18).

       It’s hard to imagine the humiliation Jesus was to endure. After
     the mock ceremony of the soldiers, He is brought to the cross and
     then, there, stripped of the last vestiges of His earthly possessions,
     the clothes off His back. Beaten, rejected, humiliated, mocked, and
     now stripped and crucified, Jesus was, indeed, drinking the bitter
     cup that, from “the foundation of the world” (Rev. 13:8), was to be
     His.

Read John 19:23, 24 (see also Matt. 27:35). What prophetic signifi-
     cance does the Bible give to what happened there, and why is it
     important?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Here is the greatest act in all cosmic history unfolding right before
     them, and these soldiers are dealing with something as petty as divid-
     ing up the clothes of one of their victims!
        And yet, their action itself isn’t so trivial, because the Bible shows
     that what the soldiers did was a fulfillment of prophecy. John directly
     links it to the psalm, saying that it happened so that “the scripture
     might be fulfilled” (Matthew does, as well), thus giving us more evi-
     dence for our faith.
        Think, too, what this could have meant to Jesus, as well. The weight
     of the world’s sin falling on Him, the separation from the Father
     bearing down on Him, Jesus then sees these soldiers, right beneath
     Him, dividing up His clothing and casting lots, all in a fulfillment of
     prophecy. This easily could have given Him extra courage to endure
     what He was facing on the cross. These actions by the soldiers were
     more evidence that, no matter how terrible His trial, no matter how
     dreadful the suffering, prophecy was being fulfilled, His earthly min-
     istry was nearing its grand climax, and the provision would be made
     that would give salvation to any human being who claimed it by faith.
     Thus, Jesus had to endure, and He did.

      What biblical prophecies have you found the most faith affirm-
      ing, especially in times of need, especially in times when trials
      have tested your faith?
                                                                         101

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Touch of Faith,” pp. 59–63,
          in The Ministry of Healing; “The Touch of Faith,” pp. 342, 343, “In
          Pilate’s Judgment Hall,” pp. 728–731, “Calvary,” p. 746, in The
          Desire of Ages.

            “The enemies of Jesus now awaited His death with impatient hope.
          That event they imagined would forever hush the rumors of His divine
          power and the wonders of His miracles. They flattered themselves
          that they should then no longer tremble because of His influence.
          The unfeeling soldiers who had stretched the body of Jesus on the
1         cross, divided His clothing among themselves, contending over one
          garment, which was woven without seam. They finally decided the
          matter by casting lots for it. The pen of inspiration had accurately
          described this scene hundreds of years before it took place: ‘For dogs
          have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me:
          they pierced my hands and my feet. . . . They part my garments among
2         them, and cast lots upon my vesture.’ Ps. 22:16, 18.”—Ellen G.
          White, The Story of Redemption, pp. 223, 224.

    Discussion Questions:
           l1 In class go over whatever Bible prophecies each person finds
           especially encouraging. How do these prophecies reveal to us the
           fact that God truly has given us very good reasons for belief?
3
           l
           2 Review the last few days of Christ’s life and the incredible
           humiliation, self-denial, and suffering He had to endure. What
           lessons can we take from them for ourselves? How can we learn
           to die to self the way that Jesus has revealed to us here?

           l3 Think of the utter ignorance of the soldiers who mocked Jesus
           with the scarlet robe and the crown of thorns. Or the ones who
           divided up His clothes beneath His feet, totally unaware of what
           was really happening. Or even that of the high priest, who rent
           his own garment in supposed righteous indignation at Christ’s
           answer to him. All of these men acted in sheer ignorance, and
           yet, all took part in perpetrating a horrible crime. Does this igno-
           rance of what they were doing in any way excuse their actions?
           Why should they be punished for something they did without
           knowing exactly what it was? Discuss.

Faith Full Circle
   Maria Villaroel lives on Easter Island, one of the most remote places on
earth. This small island, known for its mysterious stone statues, lies more
than two thousand miles west of South America.
   Maria’s husband, Atillio, traveled to Easter Island in 1975, leaving
Maria and their infant son behind in Chile. During her husband’s absence,
Maria was introduced to the Adventist message. She embraced these new
truths and was baptized just before she joined her husband on Easter
Island.
   When Maria arrived, she discovered that she was the only Seventh-day
Adventist among the 3,000 people living on the island. Maria worshiped
and taught her children Bible stories in her home on Sabbath.
   For years she prayed that God would help her to share her faith with
others. Then she met Sergio Celada, a Chilean police officer who was
visiting the island on business. She wanted to share the gospel with him,
but she wasn’t sure how. Then she remembered the Voice of Hope tapes
that she had just received. She offered them to Sergio. The tapes made a
deep impression on Sergio’s heart, and he arranged to have the recordings
broadcast over the local radio station.
   Sergio had to leave Easter Island, but he urged Maria to take the tapes
to the radio station every week. Maria did this for more than twenty years.
She became the Voice of Hope on Easter Island. People wanted to know
more about the Bible, and Maria wrote to the Voice of Hope in Chile and
asked for Bible study guides.
   Maria prayed for help to raise up a church on the island. In 1998 Gabriel
Montoya, an Adventist from Chile, visited the island. Maria begged him
to send someone to Easter Island to teach her and others who were inter-
ested more about the Bible. Gabriel sent his wife, Luz. Within a month,
30 people were studying the Bible with Luz and Maria.
   Luz continues to visit the island whenever she can, studying the Bible
with people whom Maria has introduced to the Savior. Maria’s dream of a
church on Easter Island has come true at last. Each Sabbath, 30 members
and many visitors worship together.
   The chain of faith has come full circle. Maria’s first interest, Sergio Celada,
was baptized in Chile, and her own son is studying theology. He plans to
return to Easter Island to pastor the church his mother helped to plant.
   Easter Island had no Adventist presence until an untrained believer
prayed that God would use her to plant a church. Our mission offer-
ings help make such outreach possible through programs such as Global
Mission. Thank you for giving.
Maria Villaroel is a Global Mission pioneer living on Easter Island.

              ave you ever dropped an egg and watched it break into messy
              pieces? One thing, though, you have never seen is the messy
              pieces of that broken egg dropped again, only to turn back into
      an egg. Reality just doesn’t work that way.
        A fundamental law of our natural world, at least our fallen natural
      world, is that objects tend toward decay, toward disorder. What do
      things left alone do—increase in energy, order, and structure, or
      decrease, decay, and move toward disorder? The answer’s obvious.
      We see it all around us and even in ourselves (for instance, our aging
      bodies).
        A lot of complicated science goes into explaining this phenomenon,
      but you don’t need a PhD in physics to see it. To quote a text from
      an earlier lesson, “And the earth shall wax old like a garment” (Isa.
      51:6).
        And yet, amid all this, we have the gospel, the plan of salvation,
      which at its core is about restoration, about taking the old, the broken,
      and the decaying and making it new.
        This final week we’ll look at some special clothing imagery from
      the Scriptures that reveals these promises of renewal and restoration.

     Heirs According to the Promise
       One of the great struggles of the Christian church from the earliest
     days, a struggle that was at the heart of the Protestant Reformation
     (and one that in various ways continues today, even in our church),
     deals with the question of the gospel, of salvation, of how we are
     saved. Paul, with the church in Galatia, had to deal squarely and
     directly with the issue, where false theology had crept in and threat-
     ened the integrity of the gospel itself.

Read Galatians 3:26–29. What is the main point that Paul is mak-
     ing? (As you read, note that the Greek word translated “put on”
     comes from the word meaning “to be clothed.”)
     		
     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       In verse 27, Paul says that all those who were baptized “have clothed
     yourselves with Christ” (NIV). Though all were sinners, their sins had
     been washed away, their old filthy garments were gone, and they were
     now “clothed,” covered in the righteousness of Jesus. His life, His
     perfection, and His character, they can now claim as their own. All the
     covenant promises have been fulfilled in Jesus, and now, clothed in
     Christ, they can claim those promises for themselves. They are heirs of
     the promise first made to Abraham (Gen. 12:2, 3), not because of status,
     gender, or nationality but only through faith in Christ.

Read Romans 6:1–6. What is Paul saying that should help us under-
     stand what it means to be “clothed” in Christ?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       Being clothed in Christ is more than just a legal standing with
     God. Christians are united with Christ; they are surrendered to Him;
     and through Him they are being renewed, rejuvenated, and restored.
     Christians who refuse to change their old ways, their old habits, and their
     old lifestyle need to look in the mirror at what they are really clothed in.

      What are you wearing? Is what you wear in public different
      from what you wear when no one (you think) is watching?
      What does your answer tell you about yourself?

      No Provision for the Flesh
        For all of Paul’s deep and complicated theology, he also can be
      very practical. Any theology, any version of the “gospel” that focuses
      solely on salvation in cold and legal terms alone misses the point.
      Christianity is all about Jesus, but it’s not about Jesus in isolation. It’s
      about Jesus and what He has done for our fallen race through His life,
      death, and High Priestly ministry. It’s not just about a change in our
      legal status before God; it’s about a change, a renewal, a new birth in
      us; it’s about a new life in Christ.

Read Romans 13. Focus on the daily, practical points that Paul is
      dealing with here for those who are Christians.
      ________________________________________________________
      ________________________________________________________

        Most of the chapter deals with, in many ways, what could be con-
      sidered being a good citizen and a good neighbor. It’s a reiteration
      of the principles of the law, culminating in the famous words, “Thou
      shalt love thy neighbor as thyself” (vs. 9).
        In verses 11–14, however, the tone somewhat shifts. Paul begins
      the chapter by talking about obeying the present political powers,
      and then he shifts to an emphasis on the “lateness” of the time, the
      idea being that considering the times the Romans were living in, they
      needed to get serious about their conduct. At the end of the chapter,
      we have the phrase “clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ” (vs.
      14, NIV), which uses the same Greek root found in Galatians 3:27.
      Thus, both verses are saying similar things.
        The context here in Romans 13 makes it clear what Paul basically
      means. The verses that come before and the rest of the verse following the
      phrase itself show that being clothed in Christ means living a life of faith
      and obedience. The same Greek root for “clothed” appears in verse 12,
      as well, in the context of donning the “armour of light.” Christ is the light
      of the world; those who walk in Him don’t walk in darkness. They have
      “cast off the works of darkness” and now walk in light. Whatever else to
      “be clothed” in Christ means, it certainly deals with character building,
      with conduct, with loving as Christ loved, and with reflecting His image.
      In a sense, while all things around us tend to get worse, those clothed in
      Christ should be getting better and better (see 2 Cor. 3:18).

       How different would your life be were you fully clothed in Christ?
       That is, what parts of your life have you held back from the
       kind of surrender and death to self needed in order for the Lord
       to work in you? How would your life differ were you to make
       that complete surrender?

      Putting Off, Putting On
Read Colossians 3:1–10. Keep in mind that, in verse 10, the verb to
      put on is from the same verb to be clothed that appeared in the
      previous verses we have studied. With that in mind, what are
      these verses saying to us?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         Scholars see in these verses, as in some of the other ones we’ve
      looked at, references to the idea of baptism. (Where in the texts do
      you see a hint of that?) In no uncertain terms, we are shown again
      the idea of renewal, of regeneration, of something made better than it
      was before. In Christ we are no longer the same people we once were,
      living as we once did. Here, too, Paul is very clear in linking what
      we experience of Christ now with what we will experience when He
      returns. Indeed, how we respond to Christ’s first coming will decide
      what happens to us at His second coming!

Read Ephesians 4:22–24 (yes, the Greek verb in verse 24 is to clothe).
      What point is Paul stressing here, as well?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         Notice the contrast between the “old man” and the “new man.”
      In principle, the old man, the former self, has died (symbolized by
      baptism), and a new man, a new creation in Christ, results. Here,
      too, the idea of being “clothed,” either in Christ or in the new man,
      arises in the context of Christian behavior. Read the verses that come
      before and after. We are dealing with a transformation of character, of
      actions, of a person’s whole moral being. This motif, this idea, keeps
      recurring. As baptized Christians, we are new people in the Lord; to
      be clothed in Christ isn’t a metaphor just for justification, for Christ’s
      righteousness covering our sins and giving us a new legal standing
      before God. Being clothed in Christ means being a new person, one
      “created in righteousness and true holiness” (Eph. 4:24).

       Go back over the verses for today, looking at specific com-
       mands regarding behavior. In what areas do you need change?
       If you are struggling, why not seek out someone you can trust
       and ask for help in how you can better live out the principles
       taught in Scripture?
                                                                           107

      In the Twinkling of an Eye
        No question, to be clothed in Christ is to become a new person in
      Jesus. It is to be restored, at least somewhat, into “the image of the
      One who created him” (Col. 3:10, NASB). Untold numbers of lives
      have borne and still today bear testimony to the reality of what the
      Lord has done in and for them. Many of our own lives, regardless of
      our faults, struggles, and falls, witness to the reality of what it means
      to be clothed in Jesus.
        Yet, let’s be honest. If what Christ did for us ended with this life
      here, in the end—whether we are clothed in Christ or not clothed in
      Christ—the grave would still await us. Many have suffered a great
      deal in this life for Jesus and for their faith. Whatever the immediate
      rewards, what are these rewards, what could they be, in contrast to the
      real reward awaiting us at the Second Coming?

Read 1 Corinthians 15:49–55. What great hope is presented here? As
      you read the text, guess which words come from the same Greek
      root we’ve seen all week, “to clothe” or “to be clothed.”

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        In verses 53 and 54, the verb (often translated “clothed”) is the
      same one we’ve already seen. Here, though, the apostle takes it to a
      whole new level. Being clothed in Christ doesn’t mean only to bear
      the moral image of Jesus, to reflect His character, and to live out
      the principles that He taught us. In other words, it’s not just a legal
      change, not just a moral change: it also will include a radical physical
      change. Our mortal flesh, our aching and hurting and dying flesh, will
      be clothed with the same kind of immortal body that the resurrected
      Jesus had. Talk about a change of clothing, talk about wearing a new
      garment! That’s the ultimate hope that awaits us, the only hope that
      really makes our faith worthwhile (see 1 Cor. 15:12–19).

       Most of us (particularly as we age) realize the frailty and
       untrustworthiness of our flesh. If we don’t yet see that frailty in
       ourselves, we can see it in others. Think about the hope we have
       in Jesus, as revealed in these verses. What could this world, in
       any conceivable manner, offer that would make it worth losing
       the promise revealed here?

     Our Heavenly Dwelling
Read 2 Corinthians 5:1–4. What is Paul telling us here? What hope
     is again presented? How does clothing imagery fit in? 		

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        As long as we are in this world, in this body, in this “house,” we are
     going to “groan” (from a word that means also “to sigh deeply”). Who
     hasn’t groaned while in our “earthly dwelling,” which is our present
     body? Look at the chapter that comes before (1 Corinthians 4), talking
     of the woe that followers of Jesus have encountered in this existence.
     It’s after this recitation that Paul goes into the verses for today.
        Sure, we groan, we suffer, and we die, but that’s not the whole
     story. We have the promise of being clothed in “our heavenly dwell-
     ing.”

What two metaphors, or images, does Paul use in these verses to
     depict our present situation and the hope that awaits us?

     ________________________________________________________

       In some ancient writings, the idea of being clothed was seen as
     similar to being inside a house. Both are external to us, and both
     present a certain amount of protection and covering (in Paul’s time,
     the name of the garment worn by the poorer class came from a word
     that meant “little house”). Whatever the reasons, Paul uses different
     images to contrast two basic ideas—a temporal earthly dwelling in
     contrast to an eternal heavenly one; being naked in contrast to being
     clothed; and mortality (the certainty of death) in contrast to life, eter-
     nal life in Christ. In the end, these metaphors all are talking about
     the same thing: the hope that we have, at Christ’s return, of being
     clothed or housed in immortal bodies. In other words, these verses
     (2 Corinthians 5:1–4) are another way of expressing the promise of
     eternal life that we have in Jesus.
       			
      Think about death, about the apparent finality of it. Without
      hope of something beyond it, what hope is there for any of us?
      Dwell on all the reasons that we have for our hope that death
      doesn’t have the final say. Bring your answers to class and dis-
      cuss them there.

            “All will be a happy, united family, clothed with the garments
          of praise and thanksgiving—the robe of Christ’s righteousness. All
          nature in its surpassing loveliness will offer to God a constant trib-
          ute of praise and adoration. The world will be bathed in the light of
          heaven. The years will move on in gladness. The light of the moon
1         will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven-
          fold greater than it is now. Over the scene the morning stars will sing
          together, and the sons of God will shout for joy, while God and Christ
          will unite in proclaiming, ‘There shall be no more sin, neither shall
          there be any more death.’ ”—Ellen G. White, My Life Today, p. 348.

2   Discussion Questions:
           l
           1 As a class, go over your answers to Thursday’s final ques-
           tion. How can you help each other find hope in this wonderful
           promise? How can you help those who might find themselves
           struggling with doubt?

           l
           2 So often, in our day and age, people have placed so much hope
           in science. Many have seen science as the only way of coming to
3          know truth and as the only hope of humankind. Dwell on why
           that’s such a false hope, especially in the context of the last few
           days’ lessons. What hope can science offer us for the greatest
           problem we face—death? Why must our hope be in something
           “supernatural,” as depicted in those promises?

           l
           3 Think about Paul’s question in Romans 7:24, “Who shall
           deliver me from the body of this death?” (a reference to a
           punishment of the time, when a criminal had to wear a dead
           body chained to his body). What answer do we have that all the
           world’s wisdom cannot supply?

           l
           4 Dwell more on what it means to be “clothed” in Christ in
           terms of how we are to live. Think through how you are living—
           your practices, your habits, your thoughts, your attitudes toward
           others, and so forth. How well do you reflect the reality of Christ
           in these areas? Though we all struggle with cultivated and inher-
           ited tendencies toward sin, what overt and conscious choices can
           you make that would go a long way in helping you live as you
           know you should? Also, how can we help each other, as a com-
           munity, in living out the biblical ideals presented before us?

A Passion for Souls
   Razzak stopped at the door of the Christian church in Kolkota (Calcutta),
India. Ever since he was a child he had wondered about Jesus. The door
was open, and being curious, he walked inside.
   The pastor greeted him and told him more about Jesus and introduced
him to the plan of salvation. Razzak left the church feeling a sense of
peace; somehow he knew that the Christians’ God was real.
   He found a Christian church closer to his home and began attending
services every day. Within a few months he was baptized. Razzak started
preaching and led many people to Christ. But when his infant nephew
died, the child’s parents were refused burial space in the community cem-
etery because Razzak was a Christian.
   Razzak wept to God about this problem. When people from another vil-
lage learned that the religious leaders had refused to bury the child, they
offered to bury him in their cemetery. Razzak praised God for solving the
family’s dilemma. During the funeral, Razzak read from the Bible and
preached to the people. Later Razzak asked God to send him as a mission-
ary to the very people who had refused to bury his nephew.
   He studied for a year to prepare himself to preach to these people. Then
he worked with another man who had more experience leading these
people to Christ, and together they led some one thousand families to
Christ in less than ten years.
   One day at the railway station Razzak met a man who introduced himself
as a Seventh-day Adventist. “I, too, am a Christian,” the man said. “And I
want you to know what we believe.” The man, Solomon, began explaining
what Adventists believe and showed Razzak Bible texts to back it up.
   Razzak listened as Solomon explained the Sabbath truth to him. He was
convinced and began studying his own Bible more carefully. Within a few
months, he was baptized. Razzak quit his work with the Protestant pastor
and became a lay evangelist in the heart of Kolkota, one of the largest
cities in the world.
   In less than three years, God blessed him with more than seventy con-
verts in an area where it takes great effort to lead a person to Christ. He
worships with the new believers in one of four house churches because the
believers have no church home.
   In India people believe that if a religious organization can’t provide a
house of worship, they’re not serious about their faith.
   Your mission offerings help support outreach such as Razzak’s in India.
And part of a recent Thirteenth Sabbath Offering will help build at least
one church in Kolkota, India. Thank you.
Razzak Khan shares his faith in the suburbs of Kolkota, India.

2011       Bible Study Guide for the Third Quarter

   As Seventh-day Adventists, we often cite the message in Revelation 14:6, 7, in
terms of last-day events, but these verses also can help us to understand what true
worship is. The third quarter guide on Worship, by Rosalie Zinke, will delve into this
topic. Foundational to all of our worship should be the death of Jesus on our behalf
and our response to it, which includes not only going to the Cross but going to Christ,
our High Priest, in the heavenly sanctuary.
   Worship should be permeated by a sense of reverence and awe for our God to give
us the humility and surrender needed for true worship. Our worship must be about
Him, and about giving glory to Him. As we worship, we need to do so with a sense
of accountability to God for what we do and with a realization that we can hide noth-
ing from Him. This fact should drive us to the Cross, our only hope in judgment.
   Finally, we are told to worship the Creator. Creation is foundational to all worship,
because all that we believe is based on the fact that God is the Creator. We worship
Him because He is the Creator, the Redeemer, and the Judge. Creation, Redemption,
and judgment all are closely tied, and all true worship needs to be firmly rooted in
these objective theological truths. These truths are central to what worship should
be about. It is our hope that this upcoming quarter study will teach each of us what
it means to truly worship the only One in all creation who, by virtue of who He is,
is worthy of all our worship.
Lesson 1—Worship in Genesis: Two Classes of Worshipers
      The Week at a Glance:
             Sunday: Worship in Eden (Gen. 2:1–3)
             Monday: Worship Outside of Eden (Gen. 3:15)
             Tuesday: Two Lines of Worshipers (Gen. 6:1–8)
             Wednesday: The Faith of Abraham (Gen. 12:1–8)
             Thursday: Bethel, the House of God (Gen. 28:10–22)
         Memory Text—Genesis 28:16, 17, NKJV
Sabbath Gem: In the story of Cain and Abel, we find the motif of true and false
worship, which appears throughout the Bible. The acceptable form of worship is
based on salvation by faith and focuses on God’s power, glory, and grace, while the
unacceptable form is based on works and focuses on humanity and self.
Lesson 2—Worship and the Exodus: Understanding Who God Is
      The Week at a Glance:
              Sunday: Holy Ground (Exod. 3:1–15)
              Monday: The Death of the Firstborn: Passover and Worship 		
                       (Exod. 12:1–36)
              Tuesday: No Other Gods (Exod. 20:1–6)
              Wednesday: “These Be Your Gods . . .” (Exod. 32:1–6)
              Thursday: “Show Me Your Glory” (Exod. 33:12–23)
      Memory Text—Exodus 20:2, 3, NKJV
Sabbath Gem: Early accounts of the children of Israel and their encounters
with the Lord reveal to us the nature and character of the God we profess to
serve and worship.
