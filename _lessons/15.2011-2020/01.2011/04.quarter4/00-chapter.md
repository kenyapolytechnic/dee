The Gospel in Galatians
P         aul’s letter to the Galatians has been compared to spiritual “dynamite,” and
          rightly so. Except for Romans, no other book in the Bible has sparked as
much spiritual revival and reformation. One could argue that out of the pages of
Galatians (along with Romans) Protestantism itself was born. It was while reading
Galatians that Martin Luther first was touched with the glorious good news of
righteousness by faith. “The Epistle to the Galatians,” he said, “is my epistle. To it
I am married.”
   In turn, it was Luther’s gospel-centered writings that, on Aldersgate Street in
London on May 24, 1738, transformed the life of John Wesley, who then spear-
headed a spiritual revival that swept not only through the British Isles but across the
entire English-speaking world.
   Seventh-day Adventists also are indebted to Galatians. Through the study of
Galatians, E. J. Waggoner and A. T. Jones helped the Adventist Church in the
1880s and 90s rediscover the truth of righteousness by faith.
   What is it about Galatians that has made it such a backbone of spiritual revival?
Why has it been able to touch the hearts of so many? In a manner unlike any other
book in the Bible, Galatians addresses a number of themes crucial to the Christian
soul. It is in Galatians that Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in
salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the
age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?
   Of course, other books, such as Romans, address some of these same questions,
but Galatians is different. Not only is it more succinct, but its rich themes are writ-
ten in a powerfully personal and impassioned pastoral tone that can’t help but touch
hearts open to the Spirit of God, even today.
   Although Paul’s letter speaks to us personally, our understanding can be strength-
ened if we are aware of the original historical situation that Paul, under the guidance
of the Holy Spirit, was addressing.
   Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the
earliest of Paul’s letters, perhaps written in a.d. 49,
after the famous Jerusalem council (Acts 15). The book              It is in Galatians
may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts              that Paul tackles
and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself
                                                                 issues such as free-
in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially
in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish          dom, the role of the
believers known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was          law in salvation, our
not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be              condition in Christ,
circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1). It         and the nature of the
is no surprise, then, that when Paul founded a church
of Gentiles in Galatia, some of these Judaizers traveled
                                                                 Spirit-led life, as well
there to “straighten things out.”                                as the age-old ques-
   When word of this problem reached Paul, he reacted            tion, How can sin-
fervently. Recognizing that this false gospel of salvation       ful humans be made
by faith and works threatened to undermine the work of
Christ, Paul wrote the Galatians an impassioned defense
                                                                 right before a holy
of the gospel. In the strongest of words, he identified          and just God?
this false teaching for what it really was—legalism, pure
and simple.
   This quarter’s Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he
pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. At the same time, it also gives us
a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the gospel. It’s my sincere hope
that, over the course of this quarter, God’s Spirit will spark a spiritual revival in our
hearts as we rediscover what God has done for us in Christ.

      Paul: Apostle to the
      Gentiles


      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Acts 6:9–15; 9:1–9; 1 Sam.
      16:7; Matt. 7:1; Acts 11:19–21; 15:1–5.

Memory Text: “When they heard these things they became silent;
      and they glorified God, saying, ‘Then God has also granted to the
      Gentiles repentance to life’ ” (Acts 11:18, NKJV).



      I
          t’s not that hard to understand Saul of Tarsus (also known as the
          apostle Paul after his conversion) and why he did what he did. As
          a devout Jew who was taught all his life about the importance of
      the law and about the soon-coming political redemption of Israel, the
      idea of the long-awaited Messiah being ignominiously executed like
      the worst of criminals was just too much for him to tolerate.
         No wonder, then, he was convinced that the followers of Jesus were
      being disloyal to the Torah and, thus, hindering God’s plan for Israel.
      Their claims that the crucified Jesus was the Messiah and that He had
      risen from the dead were, he believed, rank apostasy. There could be
      no tolerance for such nonsense or for anyone who refused to give up
      those notions. Saul was determined to be God’s agent to rid Israel of
      these beliefs. Hence, he first appears in the pages of Scripture as a
      violent persecutor of his fellow Jews, those who believed that Jesus
      was the Messiah.
         God, however, had far different plans for Saul, plans that he never
      could have anticipated for himself: not only was this Jew going
      to preach Jesus as the Messiah, he was going to do it among the
      Gentiles!

     Persecutor of Christians
       Saul of Tarsus first appears in Acts as one involved in the stoning of
     Stephen (Acts 7:58) and then in connection with the more wide-scale
     persecution that broke out in Jerusalem (Acts 8:1–5). Peter, Stephen,
     Philip, and Paul play a significant role in the book of Acts because
     they were involved in events that led to the spread of the Christian
     faith beyond the Jewish world. Stephen is of particular significance
     because his preaching and martyrdom appear to have had a profound
     influence on Saul of Tarsus.
       Stephen himself was a Greek-speaking Jew, and one of the original
     seven deacons (Acts 6:3–6). According to Acts, a group of foreign Jews
     who had come to live in Jerusalem (vs. 9) entered into a dispute with
     Stephen over the content of his preaching about Jesus. It is possible,
     maybe even likely, that Saul of Tarsus was involved in these debates.

Read Acts 6:9–15. What charges were brought against Stephen? Of
     what do these charges remind you? (See also Matt. 26:59–61.)

     ________________________________________________________

        The fierce hostility toward Stephen’s preaching appears to have
     resulted from two different things. On the one hand, Stephen drew the
     ire of his opponents by not placing primary importance on the Jewish
     law and the temple, which had become the focal point of Judaism and
     were treasured symbols of religious and national identity. But Stephen
     did more than merely downplay these two treasured icons; he vigor-
     ously proclaimed that Jesus, the crucified and risen Messiah, was the
     true center of the Jewish faith.
         No wonder, then, that he angered the Pharisee Saul (Phil. 3:3–6),
     whose zeal against the early Christians indicates that he probably
     belonged to a strict and militant wing of the Pharisees, one full of
     revolutionary fervor. Saul saw that the great prophetic promises of
     God’s kingdom had not yet been fulfilled (Daniel 2, Zech. 8:23,
     Isaiah 40–55), and he probably believed it was his task to help God
     bring that day about—which could be done by cleansing Israel of reli-
     gious corruption, including the idea that this Jesus was the Messiah.

      Convinced he was right, Saul was willing to put to death those
      whom he thought wrong. While we need to have zeal and fervor
      for what we believe, how do we learn to temper our zeal with
      the realization that, at times, we just might be wrong?
                                                                           7

      Saul’s Conversion
        “And he said, ‘Who are You, Lord?’ Then the Lord said, ‘I am
      Jesus, whom you are persecuting. It is hard for you to kick against
      the goads’ ” (Acts 9:5, NKJV).

     Although Saul’s persecution of the early church begins rather
   inconspicuously (as he only holds the coats of Stephen’s execution-
   ers), it quickly intensifies (see Acts 8:1–3; 9:1, 2, 13, 14, 21; 22:3–5).
   Several of the words Luke uses to describe Saul paint a picture of a
   wild, ferocious beast, or a pillaging soldier bent on the destruction of
   his opponent. The word translated as “ravaging” in Acts 8:3 (ESV),
   for example, is used in the Greek translation of the Old Testament
   (Ps. 80:13) to describe the uncontrolled and destructive behavior of
   a wild boar. Saul’s crusade against the Christians was clearly not a
   half-hearted matter of convenience; it was a deliberate and sustained
   plan to exterminate the Christian faith.
      					
Look at the three descriptions of Saul’s conversion (Acts 9:1–18,
   22:6–21, and 26:12–19). What role did the grace of God have in
   this experience? In other words, how much did Saul deserve the
   goodness that the Lord showed toward him?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Saul’s conversion, from a human perspective, must have seemed
      impossible (hence the skepticism that many expressed when they first
      heard about it).
        The only thing Saul deserved was punishment, but God extended
      grace to this fervent Jew instead. It is important to note, however, that
      Saul’s conversion did not happen in a vacuum, nor was it forced.
        Saul was no atheist. He was a religious man, though gravely mis-
      taken in his understanding of God. Jesus’ words to Paul, “ ‘ “It is hard
      for you to kick against the goads” ’ ” (Acts 26:14, ESV), indicate that
      the Spirit had been convicting Saul. In the ancient world, a “goad”
      was a stick with a sharp point used to prod oxen whenever they
      resisted plowing. Saul had resisted God’s prodding for some time,
      but, finally, on his way to Damascus, through a miraculous encounter
      with the risen Jesus, Saul chose to fight no longer.

       Think back to your own conversion experience. Maybe it
       wasn’t as dramatic as Paul’s (most aren’t), but in what similar
       ways were you the recipient of God’s grace? Why is it impor-
       tant never to forget what we have been given in Christ?

Saul in Damascus
  During Saul’s encounter with Jesus, he was blinded and then
instructed to go to the house of a man named Judas and to wait there
for another man, Ananias. No doubt Saul’s physical blindness was a
powerful reminder of the greater spiritual blindness that had led him
to persecute the followers of Jesus.
  The appearance of Jesus to him on the Damascus road changed
everything. Where Saul had thought he had been so right, he had
been dead wrong. Rather than working for God, he had been working
against Him. Saul entered Damascus a different man from the proud
and zealous Pharisee who had left Jerusalem. Instead of eating and
drinking, Saul spent his first three days in Damascus in fasting and
prayer as he reflected on all that had happened.
  Read Acts 9:10–14. Imagine what must have been going on in the
mind of Ananias: not only was Saul, the persecutor, now a believer in
Jesus, but he was also Paul, God’s chosen apostle, to take the gospel
to the Gentile world (see Acts 26:16–18).
  No wonder Ananias was a little confused. If the church in Jerusalem
was hesitant to accept Paul some three years after his conversion (Acts
9:26–30), one can imagine what questions and concerns filled the
hearts of the believers in Damascus only days after the event!
  Notice, too, that Ananias was given a vision by the Lord telling him
the surprising and unexpected news about Saul of Tarsus; anything
less than a vision might not have convinced him that what he was told
about Saul was true—that the enemy of the Jewish believers had now
become one of them.
  Saul had left Jerusalem with the authority and commission of the
chief priests to root out the Christian faith (Acts 26:12). God had,
however, a vastly different commission for Saul, one that rested on far
greater authority. Saul was to take the gospel to the Gentile world, an
idea that must have been even more shocking to Ananias and the other
Jewish believers than was the conversion of Saul himself.
  Where Saul had sought to curtail the spread of the Christian faith,
now God would use him to spread it far beyond anything that Jewish
believers ever would have imagined.

 Read 1 Samuel 16:7, Matthew 7:1, and 1 Corinthians 4:5. What
 is the message of these texts in regard to why we must be careful
 in how we view the spiritual experience of other people? What
 mistakes have you made in your judgments about others, and
 what have you learned from those mistakes?

      The Gospel Goes to the Gentiles
Where was the first Gentile church established? What events caused
      the believers to go there? Acts 11:19–21, 26. What does that
      remind you of from Old Testament times? See Daniel 2.

      _______________________________________________________

         The persecution that broke out in Jerusalem after Stephen’s death
      caused a number of Jewish believers to flee three hundred miles north
      to Antioch. As capital of the Roman province of Syria, Antioch was
      second only to Rome and Alexandria in significance. Its population,
      estimated at five hundred thousand, was extremely cosmopolitan,
      making it an ideal location not only for a Gentile church but for a
      starting base for the worldwide mission of the early church.

What occurred in Antioch that resulted in Barnabas’s visit to the city and
      his subsequent decision to invite Paul to join him in Antioch? What
      kind of picture is presented of the church there? Acts 11:20–26.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        It is difficult to construct a chronology of Paul’s life, but it appears
      that some five years passed between his post-conversion visit to
      Jerusalem (Acts 9:26–30) and the invitation by Barnabas to join him
      in Antioch. What was Paul doing during all those years? It is hard to
      say for sure. But based on his comments in Galatians 1:21, he may
      have been preaching the gospel in the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
      Some have suggested that perhaps it was during this time that he was
      disinherited by his family (Phil. 3:8) and suffered a number of the
      hardships he describes in 2 Corinthians 11:23–28.
        The church in Antioch blossomed under the guidance of the Spirit.
      The description in Acts 13:1 indicates that the cosmopolitan nature of
      the city was soon reflected in the ethnic and cultural diversity of the
      church itself. (Barnabas was from Cyprus, Lucius from Cyrene, Paul
      from Cilicia, Simon presumably from Africa, and also there were all
      the Gentile converts.) The Spirit now sought to take the gospel to even
      more Gentiles by using Antioch as the base for more far-reaching mis-
      sionary activities, beyond Syria and Judea.

       Read again Acts 11:19–26. What can we learn from the
       church at Antioch, a very culturally and ethnically diverse
       church, that could help churches today emulate the good that
       existed there?

     Conflict Within the Church
        Of course, nothing human is perfect, and it wasn’t long before
     trouble began within the early community of faith.
        For starters, not everyone was pleased with the entry of Gentile believ-
     ers into the early church. The disagreement was not over the concept of a
     Gentile mission but over the basis on which Gentiles should be allowed
     to join. Some felt that faith in Jesus alone was not sufficient as the defin-
     ing mark of the Christian; faith, they argued, must be supplemented with
     circumcision and obedience to the law of Moses. To be a true Christian,
     they asserted, Gentiles needed to be circumcised. (We can, in Acts 10:
     1–11:18, see the extent of the division between Jews and Gentiles through
     Peter’s experience with Cornelius and the reaction that followed.)
        The official visits from Jerusalem, which monitored Philip’s work
     among the Samaritans (Acts 8:14) and the work with Gentiles in
     Antioch (Acts 11:22), may suggest some concern about the inclu-
     sion of non-Jews in the Christian community. Yet, the reaction to
     Peter’s baptism of Cornelius, an uncircumcised Roman soldier, is a
     clear example of the disagreement that existed regarding the Gentile
     question among the earlier believers. The inclusion of an occasional
     Gentile such as Cornelius may have made some feel uncomfortable,
     but Paul’s intentional efforts to open wide the doors of the church
     for Gentiles on the basis of faith in Jesus alone resulted in deliberate
     attempts by some to undermine Paul’s ministry.

How did certain believers from Judea try to counteract Paul’s work
     with Gentile Christians in Antioch? Acts 15:1–5.

     ________________________________________________________

        Although the Jerusalem Council, in Acts 15, ultimately sided with
     Paul on the issue of circumcision, the opposition to Paul’s minis-
     try continued. About seven years later, during Paul’s final visit to
     Jerusalem, many were still suspicious of Paul’s gospel. In fact, when
     Paul visited the temple, he nearly lost his life when Jews from Asia
     cried out, “Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men
     every where against the people, and the law, and this place” (Acts
     21:28; see also 21:20, 21).

      Put yourself in the position of these Jewish believers who were
      concerned about Paul’s teaching. Why do their concern and
      opposition make some sense? What can we learn from this
      about how our own preconceived ideas, as well as cultural (and
      even religious) notions, can lead us astray? How can we learn
      to protect ourselves from making the same kind of errors, no
      matter how well-intentioned we are?
                                                                              11

         the church, read Ellen G. White, “Individual Independence,” pp.
         430–434, in Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3. For a helpful map of
         the early life of Paul and commentary on his conversion, see The SDA

         Courageous, independent, persevering, his talents and training would
         have enabled him to serve in almost any capacity. He could reason
         with extraordinary clearness, and by his withering sarcasm could
1        place an opponent in no enviable light. And now the Jews saw this
         young man of unusual promise united with those whom he formerly
         persecuted, and fearlessly preaching in the name of Jesus.
           “A general slain in battle is lost to his army, but his death gives
         no additional strength to the enemy. But when a man of prominence
         joins the opposing force, not only are his services lost, but those to
2        whom he joins himself gain a decided advantage. Saul of Tarsus, on
         his way to Damascus, might easily have been struck dead by the Lord,
         and much strength would have been withdrawn from the persecut-
         ing power. But God in His providence not only spared Saul’s life,
         but converted him, thus transferring a champion from the side of the
         enemy to the side of Christ. An eloquent speaker and a severe critic,
         Paul, with his stern purpose and undaunted courage, possessed the
         very qualifications needed in the early church.”—Ellen G. White, The
3        Acts of the Apostles, p. 124.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 What lesson can we learn from the fact that some of Paul’s
          harshest opponents were fellow Jews who believed in Jesus?

          l2 How can you stand up for matters of religious principle and
          at the same time make sure that you are not fighting against
          God?

    Summary: Saul’s encounter with the risen Jesus on the Damascus
         road was the defining moment in his life and in the history of the
         early church. God changed the one-time persecutor of the church and
         made him His chosen apostle to bring the gospel to the Gentile world.
         Paul’s inclusion of Gentiles in the church by faith alone, however,
         proved a difficult concept for some within the church to accept—a
         powerful example of how preconceptions and prejudice can hinder
         our mission.

A Family Affair
   Papa greeted his daughter Tamara as she entered his home. During her
visit, she noticed an invitation to a Christmas program in another church
in their city. She was curious and asked her father to go with her to the
concert.
   Papa was an elder in the Molokan church—an evangelistic, Bible-centered
church in their homeland of Azerbaijan. Polina, Tamara’s sister, wanted to
attend the concert, too. She had sensed that something was missing from
her family’s faith and for months had been praying to know more about
Bible truth.
   The concert opened evangelistic meetings, and Tamara, Polina, and her
father decided to attend. Tamara wondered who was sponsoring the meet-
ing; but the greeters were busy, and Tamara forgot to ask.
   When Tamara learned that the meetings were sponsored by Seventh-
day Adventists, she was curious to know what the name Adventist meant
and what Adventists believed. Every night she compared what the speaker
said with what she read in her own Bible. She realized that these Seventh-
day Adventists were preaching the truth.
   When the speaker invited people to a more in-depth Bible study, the
whole family signed up for the course. Tamara called her sisters who
lived in Siberia and told them what they were learning. The Siberian
sisters were worried about this new religion onto which their family had
stumbled.
   The family visited the church on Sabbath for months; but because Papa
was an elder in their church, the family hesitated to be baptized out of
respect. About this time, Tamara visited her family in Siberia. Her brother
and sisters peppered her with questions about this strange new religion
in which they had become involved. Yuri, the only brother, had been an
interrogator in the military, and as he heard her answers he became con-
vinced that the Seventh-day Adventist Church was based on the Bible.
   In time the Azerbaijan family members moved to Siberia to be near the
rest of the family, and in time the sisters were baptized together. Several
months later, Papa and Yuri were baptized as well. Now they are praying
and working to lead their spouses and children to God.
   Krasnoyarsk, Russia, where the family now lives, has several house
churches but only one small church. Part of a recent Thirteenth Sabbath
Offering will help to build a large church in the city that will help draw
many more people to Christ. Thank you for your part in supporting this
special offering and for giving faithfully to the mission offerings every
week in church.

      Paul’s Authority and
      Gospel


      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: 2 Pet. 3:15, 16; Galatians
      1; Phil. 1:1; Gal. 5:12.

Memory Text: “For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek
      to please men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a bond-
      servant of Christ” (Galatians 1:10, NKJV).



      S
             tudents at a university built a center on their campus where
             everyone—regardless of race, gender, social status, or religious
             beliefs—would be welcome. Imagine if, years later, these
      students returned to the campus only to discover that other students
      had redesigned the center. Instead of the large room with plenty of
      space for socializing—designed to bring a sense of unity to everyone
      there—the room had been subdivided into many smaller rooms with
      entrance restrictions based on race, gender, and so forth. The students
      responsible for the redesign might have argued that their authority to
      make these changes came from centuries-old established practice.
        This is something like the situation that Paul faced when he wrote
      his letter to the churches in Galatia. His plan that Gentiles could join
      on the basis of faith alone was being challenged by false teachers
      who insisted that Gentiles must also be circumcised before they could
      become members.
        This position, Paul saw, was an attack on the essence of the gos-
      pel itself; thus, he had to respond. The response is the letter to the
      Galatians.

     Paul, the Letter Writer
Read 2 Peter 3:15, 16. What do these verses tell us about how the
     early church viewed Paul’s writing? What does this teach us
     about how inspiration works?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        When Paul wrote to the Galatians, he was not trying to produce a
     literary masterpiece. Instead, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit,
     Paul was addressing specific situations that involved him and the
     believers in Galatia.
        Letters such as Galatians played an essential role in Paul’s apostolic
     ministry. As the missionary to the Gentile world, Paul founded a num-
     ber of churches scattered around the Mediterranean. Although he vis-
     ited these churches whenever he could, he couldn’t stay in one place too
     long. To compensate for his absence, Paul wrote letters to the churches
     in order to give them guidance. Over time, copies of Paul’s letters were
     shared with other churches (Col. 4:16). Although some of Paul’s letters
     have been lost, at least thirteen books in the New Testament bear his
     name. As the above words from Peter show, too, at some point Paul’s
     writings were viewed as Scripture. This shows just how much authority
     his ministry eventually gained early on in the history of the church.
        At one time some Christians believed that the format of Paul’s
     letters was unique—a special format created by the Spirit in order to
     contain God’s inspired Word. This view changed in 1896 when two
     young scholars from Oxford, Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt, dis-
     covered in Egypt about five hundred thousand fragments of ancient
     papyri (documents written on papyrus, a popular writing material
     used several hundred years before and after Christ). In addition to
     finding some of the oldest copies of the New Testament, they found
     invoices, tax returns, receipts, and personal letters.
        Much to everyone’s surprise, the basic format of Paul’s letters
     turned out to be common to all letter writers in his day. The format
     included (1) an opening salutation that mentioned the sender and the
     recipient and then included a greeting; (2) a word of thanksgiving; (3)
     the main body of the letter; and, finally, (4) a closing remark.
        In short, Paul was following the basic format of his time, speaking
     to his contemporaries through a medium and style with which they
     would be familiar.

      If the Bible were to be written today, what kind of medium, for-
      mat, and style do you think the Lord would use to reach us now?

                                                                           15

     Paul’s Calling
        Though Paul’s epistles generally follow the basic format of ancient
     letters, Galatians contains a number of unique features not found in
     Paul’s other epistles. When recognized, these differences can help us
     to better understand the situation Paul was addressing.

Compare Paul’s opening salutation in Galatians 1:1, 2 with what
     he writes in Ephesians 1:1, Philippians 1:1, and 2 Thessalonians
     1:1. In what way is Paul’s salutation in Galatians similar to and
     different from the others?


        Paul’s opening salutation in Galatians is not only a bit longer than
     his other opening salutations, but he goes out of his way to describe
     the basis of his apostolic authority. Literally, the word apostle means
     “someone who is sent” or “a messenger.” In the New Testament, in the
     strictest sense, it refers to the original twelve followers of Jesus, and to
     others to whom the risen Christ appeared and commissioned to be His
     witnesses (Gal. 1:19, 1 Cor. 15:7). Paul declares that he belongs to this
     select group.
         The fact that Paul so strongly denies that his apostleship rests on any
     human being suggests that there was an attempt by some in Galatia to
     undermine his apostolic authority. Why? As we have seen, some in the
     church were not happy with Paul’s message that salvation was based on
     faith in Christ alone and not on works of the law. They felt that Paul’s
     gospel was undermining obedience. These troublemakers were subtle.
     They knew that the foundation of Paul’s gospel message was directly
     tied to the source of his apostolic authority (John 3:34), and they deter-
     mined to launch a powerful attack against that authority.
        Yet, they did not directly deny Paul’s apostleship; they merely argued
     that it was not really too significant. They likely claimed that Paul was
     not one of Jesus’ original followers; his authority, therefore, was not from
     God but from humans—perhaps from the church leaders from Antioch
     who commissioned Paul and Barnabas as missionaries (Acts 13:1–3). Or,
     perhaps, his authority came only from Ananias, who baptized Paul in the
     first place (Acts 9:10–18). Paul, in their opinion, was simply a messenger
     from Antioch or Damascus—nothing more! Consequently, they argued
     that his message was merely his own opinion, not the Word of God.
        Paul recognized the danger these allegations posed, and so, he
     immediately defended his God-given apostleship.

      In what ways, even subtly, is the authority of Scripture being
      challenged today within the confines of our church? How can
      we recognize these challenges? More important, how have they
      perhaps influenced your own thinking in regard to the author-
      ity of the Bible?

      Paul’s Gospel
       					
In addition to defending his apostleship, what else does Paul emphasize
     in his opening greeting to the Galatians? Compare Gal. 1:3–5 with
     Eph. 1:2, Phil. 1:2, and Col. 1:2.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        One of the unique features of Paul’s letters is the way in which he links
      the words grace and peace in the greetings. The combination of these
      two words is a modification of the most characteristic greetings in the
      Greek and Jewish world. Where a Greek author would write “Greetings”
      (chairein), Paul writes “Grace,” a similar-sounding word in Greek
      (charis). To this Paul adds the typical Jewish greeting of “Peace.”
        The combination of these two words is not a mere pleasantry. On
      the contrary, the words basically describe his gospel message. (In fact,
      Paul uses these two words more than any other author in the New
      Testament.) The grace and peace are not from Paul but from God the
      Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

What aspects of the gospel does Paul include in Galatians 1:1–6?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         Although Paul has little space in his opening greeting to develop
      the nature of the gospel, he masterfully describes the essence of the
      gospel in only a few short verses. What is the central truth upon which
      the gospel resides? According to Paul, it is not our conformity to the
      law—the point that Paul’s opponents were trumpeting. On the con-
      trary, the gospel rests fully on what Christ accomplished for us through
      His death on the cross and resurrection from the dead. Christ’s death
      and resurrection did something that we never could do for ourselves.
      They broke the power of sin and death, freeing His followers from the
      power of evil, which holds so many in fear and bondage.
         As Paul reflects on the wonderful news of the grace and peace that
      God created for us in Christ, he falls into a spontaneous doxology,
      which appears in verse 5.

       In about as many words as Paul used in Galatians 1:1–5, write
       down your understanding of what the gospel is all about. Bring
       your words to class on Sabbath.

                                                                             17

      No Other Gospel
What normally follows the opening greeting in Paul’s letters? How
      is Galatians different? Compare Gal. 1:6 with Rom. 1:8, 1 Cor. 1:4,
      Phil. 1:3, and 1 Thess. 1:2.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Although Paul addressed all kinds of local challenges and problems
      in his letters to the churches, he still made it a practice to follow his
      opening greeting with a word of prayer or thanksgiving to God for the
      faith of his readers. He even does this in his letters to the Corinthians,
      who were struggling with all kinds of questionable behavior (compare
      1 Cor. 1:4 and 5:1). The situation in Galatia is so upsetting, however,
      that Paul omits the thanksgiving entirely and gets right to the point.

What strong words does Paul use that demonstrate the degree of his con-
      cern about what was happening in Galatia? Read Gal. 1:6–9, 5:12.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Paul does not hold back any words in his accusation against the
      Galatians. Simply put, he charges them with betraying their calling
      as Christians. In fact, the word turning (NJKV), which appears in
      verse 6, often was used to describe soldiers who gave up their loyalty
      to their country by deserting the army. Spiritually speaking, Paul is
      saying that the Galatians were turncoats who were turning their backs
      on God.
        How were the Galatians deserting God? By turning to a different
      gospel. Paul is not saying that there is more than one gospel, but that
      there were some in the church who—by teaching that faith in Christ
      was not enough (Acts 15:1–5)—were acting as if there were another
      one. Paul is so upset by this distortion of the gospel that he desires that
      anyone who preaches a different gospel might fall under the curse of
      God (Gal. 1:8). Paul is so emphatic about this point that he basically
      says the same thing twice (Gal. 1:9).

       There is, today, a tendency even in our church (in some places)
       to emphasize experience over doctrine. What matters most (we
       are told) is our experience, our relationship with God. However
       important experience is, what does Paul’s writing here teach us
       about the importance of correct doctrine?
18

      The Origin of Paul’s Gospel
        The troublemakers in Galatia were claiming that Paul’s gospel was
      really driven by his desire to obtain the approval of others. What
      might Paul have done differently in his letter if he were merely seek-
      ing human approval? Consider Gal. 1:6–9, 11–24.
      ________________________________________________________
      ________________________________________________________

        Why did Paul not require Gentile converts to be circumcised?
      Paul’s opponents claimed it was because Paul wanted conversions at
      any cost. Maybe they thought that because Paul knew that Gentiles
      would have reservations about circumcision, he didn’t require it. He
      was a people-pleaser! In response to such allegations, Paul points his
      opponents to the strong words he had just written in verses 8 and 9.
        If all he wanted was approval, he would surely have answered
      otherwise.

Why does Paul say it is impossible to be a follower of Christ while
      trying to please people?
      ________________________________________________________
      ________________________________________________________

After Paul’s statement in verses 11 and 12 that he received his gos-
      pel and authority directly from God, how do his words in verses
      13–24 make his point?
      ________________________________________________________
      ________________________________________________________

        Verses 13–24 provide an autobiographical account of Paul’s situation
      before his conversion (vss. 13, 14), during his conversion (vss. 15, 16),
      and afterward (vss. 16–24). Paul claims that the circumstances that sur-
      rounded each of these events make it absolutely impossible for anyone
      to claim that he received his gospel from anyone but God. Paul is not
      going to sit by and allow anyone to disparage his message by question-
      ing his calling. He knows what happened to him, he knows what he was
      called to teach, and he is going to do it, regardless of the cost.

       How certain are you of your calling in Christ? How can you
       know for sure what God has called you to do? At the same time,
       even if you are sure of your calling, why must you learn to listen
       to the counsel of others?
                                                                           19

    Further Study: “In almost every church there were some members
         who were Jews by birth. To these converts the Jewish teachers found
         ready access, and through them gained a foot-hold in the churches.
         It was impossible, by scriptural arguments, to overthrow the doc-
         trines taught by Paul; hence they resorted to the most unscrupulous
         measures to counteract his influence and weaken his authority. They
         declared that he had not been a disciple of Jesus, and had received no
         commission from him; yet he had presumed to teach doctrines directly
         opposed to those held by Peter, James, and the other apostles. . . .
            “Paul’s soul was stirred as he saw the evils that threatened speed-
1
         ily to destroy these churches. He immediately wrote to the Galatians,
         exposing their false theories, and with great severity rebuking those
         who had departed from the faith.”—Ellen G. White, Sketches From
         the Life of Paul, pp. 188, 189.

2   Discussion Questions:

          l
          1 In class, read your explanations of what you understand the gos-
          pel to be. What can you learn from the writings of each other?

          l
          2 In Paul’s greeting to the Galatians, he declared that Jesus’
          death occurred for a specific reason. What was that reason, and
          what meaning does that have for us today?
3
          l3 In Galatians 1:14 Paul says he was extremely zealous for the
          traditions of his fathers. By “traditions” he probably means both
          the oral traditions of the Pharisees and the Old Testament itself.
          What place (if any) is there for traditions in our faith? What
          warning might Paul’s experience offer for us today in regard to
          the whole question of tradition?

          l
          4 Why was Paul so seemingly “intolerant” of those who believed
          differently from the way he did? Read again some of the things
          he wrote about those who had a different view of the gospel. How
          might someone who holds such a strong, uncompromising stance
          be viewed in our church today?

    Summary: The false teachers in Galatia were trying to undermine
         Paul’s ministry by claiming that his apostleship and gospel message
         were not God-given. Paul confronts both of these accusations in the
         opening verses of his letter to the Galatians. He boldly declares that
         there is only one way of salvation and describes how the events sur-
         rounding his conversion demonstrate that his calling and gospel only
         could be from God.

A Second Chance
   Naissance [nay-SAHNS] lives in a tiny shanty home in Haiti. Like
many in her homeland, she cannot read or write. She makes a meager liv-
ing by selling boiled eggs and bananas on the street.
   Five years ago, her teenage son gave his life to God and joined the
Seventh-day Adventist Church. He urged his mother to attend church
with him and even gave her Bible studies, but she resisted his efforts and
refused to surrender her life to God. So her son turned to prayer.
   Naissance was washing clothes when the earthquake rocked southern
Haiti in January 2010. She dropped the wet clothes and fled outside, just
in time to see the building next door topple over, crushing her little house.
She watched in horror as the house on the other side of hers fell, crushing
a young child. She cried out, “Jesus, are You going to let me die too?”
   Naissance had nothing except the clothes she was wearing. She fled to
the only place of safety she knew—her son’s church. A deacon invited her
inside the gate and showed her where she could stay outside the church.
No one ventured into the building for fear of another earthquake.
   Church members gave Naissance what food they could, and someone
found a tarp under which she could sleep. Dozens more people came to
the church for safety, and soon the churchyard was filled with people.
   Three days later, the evangelistic meeting that had been interrupted by
the earthquake resumed outside the church. A woman preached power-
fully but simply, and Naissance listened with an open heart. At last, she
understood what her son had been trying to tell her—that God loves her
and wants her to become His child. She responded and was baptized fol-
lowing the meetings, with almost 250 others.
   Naissance has joined a group of women who pray for people facing dif-
ficulties. “I can’t read or write, but I can pray,” she says. Her son is help-
                             ing her learn Bible texts by repeating them to
                             her. “At last God’s Word is finding root in my
                             heart and my life. I praise Him for preserving
                             me long enough to give my heart to Him.”
                                Our mission offerings help fund evangelism
                             in Haiti and around the world. The Thirteenth
                             Sabbath Offering taken last December will

      The Unity of the Gospel




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Gal. 2:1–14, 1 Cor. 1:10–13,
   Gen. 17:1–21, John 8:31–36, Col. 3:11.
     			
Memory Text: “Complete my joy by being of the same mind, having
   the same love, being in full accord and of one mind” (Philippians
   2:2, ESV).



      P
            rotestant reformer John Calvin believed that disunity and divi-
            sion were the devil’s chief devices against the church, and he
            warned that Christians should avoid schism like the plague.
        But should unity be preserved at the cost of truth? Imagine if Martin
      Luther, the father of the Protestant Reformation, had in the name of
      unity chosen to recant his views on salvation by faith alone when he
      was brought to trial at the Diet of Worms.
        “Had the Reformer yielded a single point, Satan and his hosts
      would have gained the victory. But his unwavering firmness was the
      means of emancipating the church, and beginning a new and better
      era.”—Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, p. 166.
        In Galatians 2:1–14, we find the apostle doing all in his power to
      maintain the unity of the apostolic circle in the midst of attempts by
      some believers to destroy it. But as important as that unity was to
      Paul, he refused to allow the truth of the gospel to be compromised in
      order to achieve it. While there is room for diversity within unity, the
      gospel must never be compromised in the process.

      The Importance of Unity
     							
Read 1 Corinthians 1:10–13. What does this passage tell us about the
   importance with which Paul viewed unity in the church?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         Having refuted the allegations that his gospel was not God-given,
      Paul directs his attention in Galatians 2:1, 2 to another charge being
      made against him. The false teachers in Galatia claimed that Paul’s
      gospel was not in harmony with what Peter and the other apostles
      taught. Paul, they were saying, was a renegade.
         In response to this charge, Paul recounts a trip he made to Jerusalem
      at least fourteen years after his conversion. Although we’re not totally
      sure when that trip took place, no trip in antiquity was an easy affair.
      If he traveled by land from Antioch to Jerusalem, the three-hundred-
      mile trip would have taken at least three weeks and would have
      involved all kinds of hardships and dangers. Yet, in spite of such
      difficulties, Paul undertook the journey, not because the apostles had
      summoned him but because the Spirit had. And while he was there,
      he set his gospel before the apostles.
         Why did he do that? Certainly not because he had any doubt about
      what he was teaching. He certainly did not need any kind of reassur-
      ance from the apostles. After all, he already had been proclaiming
      the same gospel for fourteen years. And though he did not need their
      permission or approval, either, he highly valued the other apostles’
      support and encouragement.
         Thus, the accusation that his message was different was not only
      an attack on Paul but also an attack on the unity of the apostles, and
      on the church itself. Maintaining apostolic unity was vital, since
      a division between Paul’s Gentile mission and the mother church
      in Jerusalem would have had disastrous consequences. With no
      fellowship between the Gentile and Jewish Christians, then “Christ
      would be divided, and all the energy which Paul had devoted, and
      hoped to devote, to the evangelizing of the Gentile world would
      be frustrated.”—F. F. Bruce, The Epistle to the Galatians (Grand
      Rapids, Mich.: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1982),
      p. 111.

       What are some issues that threaten the unity of the church today?
       More important, after we define these issues, how do we deal with
       them? What issues are more important than unity itself?
                                                                          23

     Circumcision and the False Brothers
Why was circumcision such a focal point in the dispute between
     Paul and certain Jewish Christians? See Gen. 17:1–22; Gal.
     2:3–5; 5:2, 6; Acts 15:1, 5. Why is it not that hard to understand
     how some could have believed that even the Gentiles needed to
     undergo it?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Circumcision was the sign of the covenant relationship that God
     established with Abraham, the father of the Jewish nation. Although
     circumcision was only for Abraham’s male descendants, everyone
     was invited into the covenant relationship with God. The sign of cir-
     cumcision was given to Abraham in Genesis 17. This occurred after
     Abraham’s disastrous attempt—by fathering a child with his wife’s
     Egyptian slave—to help God fulfill His promise to him of a son.
        Circumcision was a fitting sign of the covenant. It was a reminder
     that the best-laid plans of humans can never accomplish what God
     Himself has promised. Outward circumcision was to be a symbol of
     circumcision of the heart (Deut. 10:16, 30:6, Jer. 4:4, Rom. 2:29).
     It represented a stripping away of our confidence in ourselves and a
     faithful dependence on God instead.
        During Paul’s time, however, circumcision had become a prized
     sign of national and religious identity—not what it was originally
     intended to signify. About one hundred fifty years before Jesus’ birth,
     some overly zealous patriots not only forced all uncircumcised Jews
     in Palestine to be circumcised, but they also required it of all men liv-
     ing in the surrounding nations who fell under their jurisdiction. Some
     even believed circumcision was a passport to salvation. This can
     be seen in ancient epigrams that confidently declare things such as,
     “ ‘Circumcised men do not descend into Gehenna [hell].’ ”—C. E. B.
     Cranfield, A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Epistle to the
     Romans (Edinburgh: T. & T. Clark Ltd., 1975), p. 172.
        It would be a mistake to assume that Paul was opposed to circumci-
     sion itself. What Paul objected to was the insistence that Gentiles had
     to submit to circumcision. The false teachers said: “ ‘Unless you are
     circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved’ ”
     (Acts 15:1, NKJV). The issue, then, was not really about circumcision
     but about salvation. Salvation is either by faith in Christ alone, or it is
     something earned by human obedience.

      Maybe today circumcision isn’t the issue. But what (if anything)
      do we as a church struggle with that parallels this problem?

      Unity in Diversity
Read Galatians 2:1–10. Paul says that the false brothers “slipped in
      to spy out our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, so that they
      might bring us into slavery” (Gal. 2:4, ESV). What are Christians
      free from? Read John 8:31–36; Rom. 6:6, 7; 8:2, 3; Gal. 3:23–25;
      4:7, 8; Heb. 2:14, 15. How do we experience for ourselves the real-
      ity of this freedom?
      ________________________________________________________
      ________________________________________________________

         Freedom, as a description of the Christian experience, is an impor-
      tant concept for Paul. He used the word more frequently than did any
      other author in the New Testament, and in the book of Galatians the
      words free and freedom occur numerous times. Freedom, however,
      for the Christian means freedom in Christ. It is the opportunity to live
      a life of unhindered devotion to God. It involves freedom from being
      enslaved to the desires of our sinful nature (Romans 6), freedom from
      the condemnation of the law (Rom. 8:1, 2), and freedom from the
      power of death (1 Cor. 15:55).

The apostles recognized that Paul “had been entrusted with the gospel
      to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the
      gospel to the circumcised” (Gal. 2:7, ESV). What does this suggest
      about the nature of unity and diversity within the church?
      ________________________________________________________
      ________________________________________________________

        The apostles acknowledged that God had called Paul to preach
      the gospel to the Gentiles, just as He had called Peter to preach to
      the Jews. In both cases, the gospel was the same, but the way it was
      presented depended on the people the apostles were trying to reach.
      Implicit in this verse “is the important recognition that one and the
      same formula is bound to be heard differently and to have differ-
      ent force in different social and cultural contexts. . . . It is precisely
      this oneness which is the basis of Christian unity, precisely as unity
      in diversity.”—James D. G. Dunn, The Epistle to the Galatians
      (Peabody, Mass.: Hendrickson Publishers, Inc., 1993), p. 106.
       How open should we be to methods of evangelism and witness-
       ing that take us out of our “comfort zone”? Are there some
       forms of evangelism that bother you? If so, what are they,
       why do they bother you, and might you need to be more open-
       minded about these things?
                                                                            25

     Confrontation in Antioch (Gal. 2:11–13)
       Some time after Paul’s consultation in Jerusalem, Peter made a
     visit to Antioch in Syria, the location of the first Gentile church and
     the base of Paul’s missionary activities as described in Acts. While
     there, Peter ate freely with the Gentile Christians, but when a group
     of Jewish Christians arrived from James, Peter—fearful of what they
     would think—changed his behavior entirely.

Why should Peter have known better? Compare Gal. 2:11–13 and Acts
     10:28. What does his action tell us about just how powerfully
     ingrained culture and tradition can be in our lives?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       Some have mistakenly assumed that Peter and the other Jews with
     him had ceased following the Old Testament laws about clean and
     unclean food. This, however, does not seem to be the case. If Peter
     and all the Jewish Christians had abandoned the Jewish food laws, a
     major uproar in the church certainly would have followed. If so, there
     would surely be some record of it, but there is not. It is more likely
     that the issue was about table fellowship with Gentiles. Because many
     Jews saw Gentiles as unclean, it was a practice among some to avoid
     social contact with Gentiles as much as possible.
       Peter had struggled with this issue himself, and it was only a vision
     from God that helped him to see it clearly. Peter said to Cornelius,
     the Roman centurion, after he entered his house, “ ‘You yourselves
     know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or to visit anyone
     of another nation, but God has shown me that I should not call any
     person common or unclean’ ” (Acts 10:28, ESV). Although he knew
     better, he was so afraid of offending his own countrymen that he
     reverted to his old ways. That’s, apparently, how strong the pull of
     culture and tradition was in Peter’s life.
       Paul, though, called Peter’s actions exactly what they were: the
     Greek word he used in Galatians 2:13 is hypocrisy. Even Barnabas, he
     said, was “carried away with their hypocrisy” (NKJV). Strong words
     from one man of God to another.

      Why is it so easy to be a hypocrite? (Isn’t it, perhaps, that we
      tend to blind ourselves to our own faults while eagerly looking
      for faults in others?) What kind of hypocrisy do you find in
      your own life? More important, how can you recognize it and
      then root it out?

     Paul’s Concern (Gal. 2:14)
       The situation in Antioch surely was tense: Paul and Peter, two lead-
     ers in the church, were in open conflict. And Paul holds nothing back
     as he calls Peter to account for his behavior.

What reasons does Paul give for publicly confronting Peter? Gal.
     2:11–14.
     ________________________________________________________

        As Paul saw it, the problem was not that Peter had decided to eat
     with the visitors from Jerusalem. Ancient traditions about hospitality
     certainly would have required as much.
        The issue was “the truth of the gospel.” That is, it wasn’t just an
     issue of fellowship or dining practices. Peter’s actions, in a real sense,
     compromised the whole message of the gospel.

Read Galatians 3:28 and Colossians 3:11. How does the truth in
     these texts help us understand Paul’s strong reaction?

        During Paul’s meeting in Jerusalem with Peter and the other apos-
     tles, they had come to the conclusion that Gentiles could enjoy all of
     the blessings in Christ without first having to submit to circumcision.
     Peter’s action now put that agreement in jeopardy. Where once Jewish
     and Gentile Christians had joined in an environment of open fellow-
     ship, now the congregation was divided, and this held the prospect of
     a divided church in the future.
        From Paul’s perspective, Peter’s behavior implied that the Gentile
     Christians were second-rate believers at best, and he believed that
     Peter’s actions would place strong pressure upon the Gentiles to
     conform if they wanted to experience full fellowship. Thus, Paul says,
      “ ‘If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how
     can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?’ ” (Gal. 2:14, ESV). The
     phrase “to live like Jews” can be more literally translated as “to
     Judaize.” This word was a common expression that meant “to adopt
     a Jewish way of life.” It was used for Gentiles who attended a syna-
     gogue and participated in other Jewish customs. It is also the reason
     that Paul’s opponents in Galatia, whom he calls the false brothers, are
     often referred to as “the Judaizers.”

      As if Peter’s actions weren’t bad enough, Barnabas got caught
      up in this behavior, as well—someone who should have also
      known better. What a clear example of the power of “peer
      pressure”! How can we learn to protect ourselves from being
      swayed in the wrong direction by those around us?
                                                                           27

    Further Study: For further study on the issue of unity and diver-
         sity in the church, read Ellen G. White, “Investigation of New Light,”
         pp. 45, 47, in Counsels to Writers and Editors; “An Explanation of
         Early Statements,” p. 75, in Selected Messages, book 1; “Tactfulness,”
         pp. 117–119, in Gospel Workers; and “Manuscript Release 898,” pp.
         1092, 1093, in 1888 Materials, vol. 3.

            “Even the best of men, if left to themselves, will make grave
         blunders. The more responsibilities placed upon the human agent,
         the higher his position to dictate and control, the more mischief he is
1        sure to do in perverting minds and hearts if he does not carefully fol-
         low the way of the Lord. At Antioch Peter failed in the principles of
         integrity. Paul had to withstand his subverting influence face to face.
         This is recorded that others may profit by it, and that the lesson may
         be a solemn warning to the men in high places, that they may not fail
         in integrity, but keep close to principle.”—Ellen G. White Comments,
2        The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1108.

    Discussion Questions:
          l1 Very few people enjoy confrontation, but sometimes it is nec-
          essary. In what circumstances should a church condemn error,
          and discipline those who refuse to accept correction?

          l
          2 As the Seventh-day Adventist Church grows around the
3         world, it becomes more and more diverse. What steps can the
          church take to make sure that unity is not lost in the midst of
          such diversity? How can we learn to accept and even enjoy the
          diversity of cultures and traditions among us, while at the same
          time maintaining unity?

          l
          3 When sharing the gospel in a different culture, what are
          the essential elements that should not change, and what can be
          changed? How do we learn to distinguish between what must
          remain and what we can, if necessary, let go?

    Summary: The insistence by some Jewish Christians that Gentiles
         must be circumcised in order to become true followers of Christ posed
         a serious threat to the unity of the early church. Instead of letting this
         issue divide the church into two different movements, the apostles
         worked together, in spite of conflicts among themselves, to ensure
         that the body of Christ stayed united and faithful to the truth of the
         gospel.

Those Dreaded Adventists
   Rudy Micelli grew up in a musical Christian family in Brazil. He’s sung
praises to God since he was a child. Often he would pretend to sing along
with a favorite recording, and as he grew older, singing for God became
his passion.
   While studying some religion classes, Rudy took a class on cults. Rudy’s
teacher warned of many cults, including the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
“Adventists perform blood rituals in their worship,” the teacher said. “They
are dangerous and should be avoided!”
   Some time later, as he browsed through radio stations, Rudy came across a
station playing a beautifully orchestrated hymn. He listened to the song and
several more beautiful renditions of hymns he loved. “The music thrilled
me. It was so well performed and gave glory to God.” Then he heard the
station identification and realized that he was listening to a Seventh-day
Adventist radio station!
   Quickly, he turned the radio off. But he wondered, How can such beauti-
ful music come from a bad sect? He turned the radio back on, promising
himself to listen only to the music, not the spoken messages.
   Rudy continued listening to the Seventh-day Adventist station. He espe-
cially enjoyed the voice of one female vocalist. But he was careful not to tell
his family that he was listening to “those dreaded Adventists.”
   One day he learned that his favorite recording artist would be singing
in his city. He must go hear her, he decided. But to his dismay the concert
would be held in the Seventh-day Adventist church. Is this the devil’s
trap to get me into a Seventh-day Adventist church? he wondered. But he
rationalized that it was only a concert, and he did want to hear her sing. He
decided to go. He prayed for God’s protection and approached the concert
with mixed excitement and dread.
   He was greeted warmly as he entered the church and was ushered to
reserved seats for visitors, in the front row. He scanned the room, but saw
no evidence of a sacrificial altar or any other indication that this church
worshiped darkness. As he sat down and prayed, a sense of the presence of
God took him by surprise. It felt so right to be there.
   At the end of the concert, he found the pastor and told him, “I want to study
the Bible with you. Can we start right away?” The surprised pastor agreed, and
six months later, Rudy was baptized into the Seventh-day Adventist family.
   Today Rudy sings with an Adventist music ministry that spans the world,
leading people to Christ in many countries. And it all started with a song
on the radio.
   Radio continues to lead thousands to Jesus every year. Our mission offerings
help support the ministry of Seventh-day Adventist radio around the world.

      Justification by Faith
      Alone


      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Gal. 2:15–21; Eph. 2:12;
      Phil. 3:9; Rom. 3:10–20; Gen. 15:5, 6; Rom. 3:8.

Memory Text: “I have been crucified with Christ. It is no lon-
      ger I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live
      in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and
      gave himself for me” (Galatians 2:20, ESV).



      A
               s we saw last week, Paul publicly confronted Peter in Antioch
               for the lack of consistency between the faith he advocated and
               the behavior he displayed. Peter’s decision no longer to eat
      with former pagans suggested that they were second-rate Christians,
      at best. His actions implied that if they really wanted to be part of the
      family of God and enjoy the blessings of full table fellowship, they
      must first submit to the rite of circumcision.
         What did Paul actually say to Peter on that tense occasion? In
      this week’s lesson, we will study what is likely a summary of what
      went on. This passage contains some of the most compressed word-
      ing in the New Testament, and it is extremely significant, because
      it introduces us for the first time to several words and phrases that
      are foundational both to understanding the gospel and to the rest of
      Paul’s letter to the Galatians. These key words include justification,
      righteousness, works of law, belief, and not only faith but even the
      faith of Jesus.
         What does Paul mean by these terms, and what do they teach us
      about the plan of salvation?

      The Question of “Justification” (Gal. 2:15, 16)
In Galatians 2:15, Paul writes, “We ourselves are Jews by birth and not
      Gentile sinners” (ESV). What point do you think he was making?

      ________________________________________________________

         Paul’s words need to be understood in their context. In an attempt
      to win over his fellow Jewish Christians to his position, Paul starts
      with something with which they would agree—the traditional dis-
      tinction between Jews and Gentiles. Jews were the elect of God,
      entrusted with His law, and they enjoyed the benefits of the covenant
      relationship with Him. Gentiles, however, were sinners; God’s law
      did not restrain their behavior, and they were outside the covenants of
      promise (Eph. 2:12, Rom. 2:14). While Gentiles were obviously “sin-
      ners,” in verse 16 Paul warns the Jewish Christians that their spiritual
      privileges do not make them any more acceptable to God, because no
      one is justified by “works of the law.”

Paul uses the word justified four times in Galatians 2:16, 17. What
      does he mean by “justification”? Consider Exod. 23:7 and Deut.
      25:1.

      ________________________________________________________

        The verb to justify is a key term for Paul. Of the thirty-nine times it
      occurs in the New Testament, twenty-seven are in Paul’s letters. He
      uses it eight times in Galatians, including four references in Galatians
      2:16, 17. Justification is a legal term, used in courts of law. It deals
      with the verdict a judge pronounces when a person is declared inno-
      cent of the charges brought against him or her. It is the opposite of
      condemnation. Additionally, because the words just and righteous
      come from the same Greek word, for a person “to be justified” means
      that the person also is counted as “righteous.” Thus, justification
      involves more than simply pardon or forgiveness; it is the positive
      declaration that a person is righteous.
        For some of the Jewish believers, however, justification also was
      relational. It revolved around their relationship with God and His
      covenant. To be “justified” also meant that a person was counted
      as a faithful member of God’s covenantal community, the family of
      Abraham.

       Read Galatians 2:15–17. What is Paul saying to you here, and
       how can you apply these words to your own Christian experi-
       ence?

      Works of the Law
Paul says three times in Galatians 2:16 that a person is not justified
      by “works of the law.” What does he mean by the expression
      “works of the law”? How do these texts (Gal. 2:16, 17; 3:2, 5, 10;
      Rom. 3:20, 28) help us understand his meaning?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         Before we can understand the phrase “the works of the law,” we first
      need to understand what Paul means by the word law. The word law
      (nomos in Greek) is found 121 times in Paul’s letters. It can refer to a num-
      ber of different things, including God’s will for His people, the first five
      books of Moses, the entire Old Testament, or even just a general principle.
      However, the primary way Paul uses it is to refer to the entire collection of
      God’s commandments as given to His people through Moses.
         Therefore, the phrase “the works of the law” likely involves all
      the requirements found in the commandments given by God through
      Moses, whether moral or ceremonial. Paul’s point is that no matter how
      hard we try to follow and obey God’s law, our obedience never will be
      good enough for God to justify us, to have us declared righteous before
      God. That’s because His law requires absolute faithfulness in thought
      and action—not just some of the time but all of the time, and not just
      for some of His commandments but for all of them.
         Although the phrase “works of the law” does not occur in the Old
      Testament and is not found in the New Testament outside of Paul, stun-
      ning confirmation of its meaning emerged in 1947 with the discovery
      of the Dead Sea Scrolls, a collection of writings copied by a group of
      Jews, called Essenes, who lived at the time of Jesus. Although written
      in Hebrew, one of the scrolls contains this exact phrase. The scroll’s
      title is Miqsat Ma’as Ha-Torah, which can be translated, “Important
      Works of the Law.” The scroll describes a number of issues based on
      biblical law concerned with preventing holy things from being made
      impure, including several that marked the Jews out as separate from
      the Gentiles. At the end the author writes that if these “works of the
      law” are followed, “you will be reckoned righteous” before God.
      Unlike Paul, the author does not offer his reader righteousness on the
      basis of faith but on the basis of behavior.

       In your experience, how well do you keep God’s law? Do you
       really sense that you keep it so well that you can be justified
       before God on the basis of your law-keeping? See Rom. 3:10–20.
       If not, why not—and how does your answer help you under-
       stand Paul’s point here?

The Basis of Our Justification
   “And be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which
is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righ-
teousness which is from God by faith” (Phil. 3:9, NKJV).

   We should not assume Jewish Christians were suggesting that faith in
Christ was not important; after all, they were all believers in Jesus. They
all had faith in Him. Their behavior showed, however, that they felt
faith was not sufficient by itself; it must be supplemented with obedi-
ence, as if our obedience adds something to the act of justification itself.
Justification, they would have argued, was by both faith and works. The
way that Paul repeatedly contrasts faith in Christ with the works of the
law indicates his strong opposition to this kind of “both/and” approach.
Faith, and faith alone, is the basis of justification.
   For Paul, too, faith is not just an abstract concept; it is inseparably
connected to Jesus. In fact, the phrase translated twice as “faith in
Christ” in Galatians 2:16 is far richer than any translation can really
encompass. The phrase in Greek is translated literally as “the faith”
or “the faithfulness” of Jesus. This literal translation reveals the pow-
erful contrast Paul is making between the works of the law that we
do and the work of Christ accomplished in our behalf, the works that
He, through His faithfulness (hence, the “faithfulness of Jesus”), has
done for us.
   It’s important to remember that faith itself doesn’t add to justifica-
tion, as if faith were meritorious in and of itself. Faith is, instead, the
means by which we take hold of Christ and His works in our behalf.
We are not justified on the basis of our faith but on the basis of Christ’s
faithfulness for us, which we claim for ourselves through faith.
   Christ did what every individual has failed to do: He alone was
faithful to God in everything He did. Our hope is in Christ’s faithful-
ness, not our own. As one author puts it, “We believe in Christ, not
that we might be justified by that belief, but that we might be justi-
fied by his faith (fulness) to God.”—John McRay, Paul: His Life and
Teaching (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Academic, 2003), p. 355.
   An early Syriac translation of Galatians 2:16 conveys Paul’s mean-
ing well: “Therefore we know that a man is not justified from the
works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus the Messiah, and we believe
in him, in Jesus the Messiah, that from his faith, that of the Messiah,
we might be justified, and not from the works of the law.”

 Read Romans 3:22, 26; Galatians 3:22; Ephesians 3:12; and
 Philippians 3:9. How do these texts, and what we read above,
 help us to understand the amazing truth that Christ’s faithful-
 ness for us, His perfect obedience to God, is the only basis of
 our salvation?
                                                                        33

      The Obedience of Faith
        Paul makes it clear that faith absolutely is foundational to the
      Christian life. It is the means by which we lay hold of the promises we
      have in Christ. But what is faith exactly? What does it involve?

What do the following texts teach us about the origin of faith? Gen.
      15:5, 6; John 3:14–16; 2 Cor. 5:14, 15; Gal. 5:6.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Genuine biblical faith is always a response to God. Faith is not
      some kind of feeling or attitude that humans one day decide to have
      because God requires it. On the contrary, true faith originates in a
      heart touched with a sense of gratitude and love for God’s goodness.
      That’s why when the Bible talks about faith, that faith always follows
      initiatives that God has taken. In the case of Abraham, for example,
      faith is his response to the amazing promises God makes to him (Gen.
      15:5, 6), while in the New Testament, Paul says that faith is ultimately
      rooted in our realization of what Christ did for us on the cross.

If faith is a response to God, what should that response include? Consider
      what the following texts say about the nature of faith. John 8:32, 36;
      Acts 10:43; Rom. 1:5, 8; 6:17; Heb. 11:6; James 2:19.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         Many people define faith as “belief.” This definition is problematic,
      because in Greek the word for “faith” is simply the noun form of the
      verb “to believe.” To use one form to define the other is like saying
      “faith is to have faith.” It tells us nothing.
         A careful examination of Scripture reveals that faith involves not
      only knowledge about God but a mental consent or acceptance of that
      knowledge. This is one reason why having an accurate picture of God
      is so important. Distorted ideas about the character of God actually can
      make it more difficult to have faith. But an intellectual assent to the gos-
      pel is not enough, for, in that sense, “even the demons believe.” True
      faith also affects the way a person lives. In Romans 1:5, Paul writes
      about the “obedience of faith.” Paul is not saying that obedience is the
      same as faith. He means true faith affects the whole of a person’s life,
      not just the mind. It involves commitment to our Lord and Savior Jesus
      Christ, as opposed to just a list of rules. Faith is as much what we do and
      how we live and in whom we trust as it is what we believe.

      Does Faith Promote Sin?
        One of the main accusations against Paul was that his gospel of
      justification by faith alone encouraged people to sin (see Rom. 3:8,
      6:1). No doubt the accusers reasoned that if people do not have to
      keep the law to be accepted by God, why should they be concerned
      with how they live?

How does Paul respond to the accusation that a doctrine of justifica-
      tion by faith alone encourages sinful behavior? Gal. 2:17, 18.

      ________________________________________________________

        Paul responds to his opponents’ charges in the strongest terms
      possible: “God forbid!” While it is possible that a person might fall
      into sin after coming to Christ, the responsibility would certainly
      not belong to Christ. If we break the law, we ourselves are the law-
      breakers.

How does Paul describe his union with Jesus Christ? In what way
      does this answer refute the objections raised by his opponents?
      Gal. 2:19–21.

      ________________________________________________________

        Paul finds the reasoning of his opponents simply preposterous.
      Accepting Christ by faith is not something trivial; it is not a game of
      heavenly make-believe where God counts a person as righteous while
      there is no real change in how that person lives. On the contrary, to
      accept Christ by faith is extremely radical. It involves a complete
      union with Christ—a union in both His death and resurrection.
      Spiritually speaking, Paul says we are crucified with Christ, and our
      old sinful ways rooted in selfishness are finished (Rom. 6:5–14). We
      have made a radical break with the past. Everything is new (2 Cor.
      5:17). We have also been raised to a new life in Christ. The resur-
      rected Christ lives within us, daily making us more and more like
      Himself. 			
        Faith in Christ, therefore, is not a pretext for sin but a call to a much
      deeper, richer relationship with Christ than could ever be found in a
      law-based religion.

       How do you relate to the concept of salvation by faith alone
       without the deeds of the law? Does it, perhaps, scare you a
       little, making you think that it can be an excuse for sin—or
       do you rejoice in it? What does your answer say about your
       understanding of salvation?
                                                                             35

    Further Study: “The danger has been presented to me again and again
         of entertaining, as a people, false ideas of justification by faith. I have
         been shown for years that Satan would work in a special manner to
         confuse the mind on this point. The law of God has been largely dwelt
         upon and has been presented to congregations, almost as destitute of
         the knowledge of Jesus Christ and His relation to the law as was the
         offering of Cain. I have been shown that many have been kept from
         the faith because of the mixed, confused ideas of salvation, because
         the ministers have worked in a wrong manner to reach hearts. The
         point that has been urged upon my mind for years is the imputed
         righteousness of Christ. . . .
1           “There is not a point that needs to be dwelt upon more earnestly,
         repeated more frequently, or established more firmly in the minds of
         all than the impossibility of fallen man meriting anything by his own
         best good works. Salvation is through faith in Jesus Christ alone.”
         —Ellen G. White, Faith and Works, pp. 18, 19.
            “The law demands righteousness, and this the sinner owes to the
2        law; but he is incapable of rendering it. The only way in which he can
         attain to righteousness is through faith. By faith he can bring to God
         the merits of Christ, and the Lord places the obedience of His Son
         to the sinner’s account. Christ’s righteousness is accepted in place
         of man’s failure, and God receives, pardons, justifies, the repentant,
         believing soul, treats him as though he were righteous, and loves him
         as He loves His Son.”—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 1,
         p. 367.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 In the first passage quoted above, Ellen G. White says no
          subject needs to be emphasized more than justification by faith.
          As a class, discuss whether her comments are as applicable for
          us today as they were when she wrote them over a hundred years
          ago and, if so, why.

          l
          2 Why does Paul say that Christ would have died for no pur-
          pose, if justification were through the law? Gal. 2:21. What does
          he mean by that?

    Summary: Peter’s behavior in Antioch suggested that former pagans
         could not be true Christians unless they were first circumcised. Paul
         pointed out the fallacy of such thinking. God cannot pronounce any-
         one righteous on the basis of that person’s behavior, for even the best
         humans are not perfect. It is only by accepting what God has done for
         us in Christ that sinners can be justified in His sight.

Those Evil Christians
  Tawgy slowed his steps as he neared his home in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.
“Dear Father,” he prayed, “help my parents not to be angry with me for
going to church instead of doing my chores. Help them to understand that
I’m not trying to disobey them, but that I want to obey You.”
  Thirteen-year-old Tawgy had been a Christian for only a few months,
and his parents still were deeply concerned that he had joined “this evil
sect.” Tawgy understood, for he, too, had heard the rumors that some
extreme Christians committed suicide. He tried to convince his parents
that he wasn’t at all involved with such an extremist group.
  Tawgy was just 12 when his aunt invited him to visit the Seventh-day
Adventist Church with her. He didn’t want to go; but he felt obligated to
obey his aunt, so he went. He enjoyed the meeting and liked the young
pastor who spoke. Tawgy attended the rest of the meetings and accepted
Jesus as his Savior. His parents tried to dissuade him from attending
church and often gave him work assignments to keep him home on
Sabbath, but he stood his ground.
  Tawgy’s classmates shunned him when he began associating with boys
who drank and smoked. But when he became a Christian, his classmates
thought that he had done something even worse! Tawgy stopped spending
time with his former friends, and, in time, his classmates realized that he
really had changed for the better. To his joy, Tawgy learned that four of
his former friends had also become Christians.
  Always somewhat shy, Tawgy struggled to gain confidence. His church
family has encouraged him, and now he finds it easy to talk to people.
“My friends at church are like my family,” he says. “They pray for me
and help me stay faithful to God when I’m weak. They make it easier for
me to be the only believer in my family.”
                               The Seventh-day Adventist Church in Mongolia
                            is just taking root. With fewer than 2,000 mem-
                            bers, standing for one’s faith can be difficult.
                            Pray for the believers in Mongolia, and remem-
                            ber that your mission offerings are helping the
                            church to grow in regions such as Mongolia,
                            one of the uttermost parts of the earth.

Memory Text: “Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by
      becoming a curse for us—for it is written, ‘Cursed is everyone
      who is hanged on a tree’ ” (Galatians 3:13, ESV).



      A
               little boy made a little boat, all painted and fixed up beauti-
               fully. One day someone stole his boat, and he was distressed.
               In passing a pawnshop one day he saw his boat. Happily he
      ran in to the pawnbroker and said, ‘That is my little boat.’ ‘No,’ said
      the pawnbroker, ‘it is mine, for I bought it.’ ‘Yes,’ said the boy, ‘but
      it is mine, for I made it.’ ‘Well,’ said the pawnbroker, ‘if you will pay
      me two dollars, you can have it.’ That was a lot of money for a boy
      who did not have a penny. Anyway, he resolved to have it; so he cut
      grass, did chores of all kinds, and soon had his money.
         “He ran down to the shop and said, ‘I want my boat.’ He paid the
      money and received his boat. He took the boat up in his arms, and
      hugged and kissed it, and said, ‘You dear little boat, I love you. You
      are mine. You are twice mine. I made you, and now I have bought
      you.’
         “So it is with us. We are, in a sense, twice the Lord’s. He cre-
      ated us, and we got into the devil’s pawnshop. Then Jesus came and
      bought us at awful cost—not silver and gold, but His precious blood.
      We are the Lord’s by creation and by redemption.”—William Moses

     The Foolish Galatians
Read Galatians 3:1–5. Summarize below what Paul is saying to the
     Galatians. In what sense could we be in danger of falling into the
     same spiritual pitfall, of starting out right and then falling into
     legalism?

      _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Several modern translations have tried to capture the sense of Paul’s
     words in verse 1 about the “foolish” Galatians. The actual word Paul
     uses in Greek is even stronger than that. The word is anoetoi, and it
     comes from the word for mind (nous). Literally, it means “mindless.”
     The Galatians were not thinking. Paul does not stop there; he says that
     because they are acting so foolishly, he wonders if some magician has
     cast a spell on them. “Who has bewitched you?” His choice of words
     here may even suggest that the ultimate source behind their condition
     is the devil (2 Cor. 4:4).
        What baffles Paul so much about the Galatians’ apostasy on the
     gospel is that they knew salvation was rooted in the Cross of Christ.
     It was not something that they could have missed. The word translated
     as “portrayed” or “set forth” (KJV) in Galatians 3:1 literally means
     “placarded” or “painted.” It was used to describe all public procla-
     mations. Paul is saying that the Cross was such a central part of his
     preaching that the Galatians had, in effect, seen in their mind’s eye
     Christ crucified (1 Cor. 1:23, 2:2). In a sense, he’s saying that, by
     their actions, they are turning away from the Cross.
        Paul then contrasts the current experience of the Galatians with
     how they first came to faith in Christ. He does this by asking them
     some rhetorical questions. How did they receive the Spirit, meaning
     How did they first become Christians? And from a slightly differ-
     ent perspective, Why did God give the Spirit? Was it because they
     did something to earn it? Certainly not! Instead, it was because they
     believed the good news of what Christ had already done for them.
     Having begun so well, what would make them think that now they
     had to rely upon their own behavior?

      How often, if ever, do you find yourself thinking, I’m doing pretty
      well. I’m a pretty solid Christian, I don’t do this and I don’t do that . . .
      and then, even subtly, thinking you’re somehow good enough to
      be saved? What’s wrong with that picture?
                                                                                39

     Grounded in Scripture
       So far, in his letter to the Galatians, Paul has defended his gospel of
     justification by faith by appealing to the agreement reached with the
     apostles in Jerusalem (Gal. 2:1–10) and to the personal experience of
     the Galatians themselves (Gal. 3:1–5). Beginning in Galatians 3:6,
     Paul now turns to the testimony of Scripture for the final and ultimate
     confirmation of his gospel. In fact, Galatians 3:6–4:31 is made up of
     progressive arguments rooted in Scripture.

What does Paul mean when he writes about the “Scripture” in
     Galatians 3:6–8? Consider Rom. 1:2, 4:3, 9:17.

     ________________________________________________________

        It is important to remember that at the time Paul wrote his letter to
     the Galatians there was no “New Testament.” Paul was the earliest
     New Testament writer. The Gospel of Mark is probably the earliest of
     the four gospels, but it likely was not written until around the time of
     Paul’s death (a.d. 65)—that is, about fifteen years after Paul’s letter
     to the Galatians. So, when Paul refers to the Scriptures, he has only
     the Old Testament in mind.
        The Old Testament Scriptures play a significant role in Paul’s
     teachings. He does not view them as dead texts but as the authoritative
     and living Word of God. In 2 Timothy 3:16 he writes, “All Scripture
     is given by inspiration of God.” The word translated “inspiration” is
     theopneustos. The first part of the word (theo) means “God,” while
     the second half means “breathed.” Scripture is “God-breathed.” Paul
     uses the Scripture to demonstrate that Jesus is the promised Messiah
     (Rom. 1:2), to give instruction in Christian living (Rom. 13:8–10), and
     to prove the validity of his teachings (Gal. 3:8, 9).
        It is difficult to determine exactly how many hundreds of times Paul
     quotes the Old Testament, but quotes are found throughout all his let-
     ters, except his shortest ones, Titus and Philemon.

Read carefully Galatians 3:6–14. Identify the passages Paul quotes
     from the Old Testament in those verses. What does that tell us
     about how authoritative the Old Testament was?

      Do you at times find yourself thinking that one part of the Bible
      is more “inspired” than other parts? Given Paul’s statement in
      2 Timothy 3:16, what’s the danger of going down that path?

     Reckoned as Righteous
Why do you think Paul first appeals to Abraham as he looks to the
     Scriptures to validate his gospel message? Gal. 3:6.


        Abraham was a central figure in Judaism. Not only was he the
     father of the Jewish race, but Jews in Paul’s time also looked to him
     as the prototype of what a true Jew should be like. Many not only
     believed that his defining characteristic was his obedience, but that
     God had declared Abraham righteous because of that obedience. After
     all, Abraham forsook his homeland and family, he accepted circumci-
     sion, and he was even willing to sacrifice his son at God’s command.
     That’s obedience! With their insistence on circumcision, Paul’s oppo-
     nents certainly argued along these same lines.
        Paul, however, turns the tables by appealing to Abraham—nine
     times in Galatians—as an example of faith instead of law-keeping.

Consider Paul’s quotation of Genesis 15:6. What does it mean
     when it says that Abraham’s faith was “counted . . . to him for
     righteousness”? See also Rom. 4:3–6, 8–11, 22–24.

     _______________________________________________________

        Whereas justification was a metaphor taken from the legal world,
     the word counted, or reckoned, is a metaphor drawn from the domain
     of business. It can mean “to credit” or “to place something to one’s
     account.” Not only is it used of Abraham in Galatians 3:6, but it
     occurs another 11 times in connection with the patriarch. Some Bible
     versions translate it as counted, reckoned, or imputed.
        According to Paul’s metaphor, what is placed to our accounts is
     righteousness. The question is, however, On what basis does God
     count us as righteous? It surely cannot be on the basis of obedience—
     despite what Paul’s opponents claimed. No matter what they said
     about Abraham’s obedience, Scripture says that it was because of
     Abraham’s faith that God counted him as righteous.
        The Bible is clear: Abraham’s obedience was not the ground of his
     justification; it was, instead, the result. He didn’t do the things he did
     in order to be justified; he did them because he, already, was justified.
     Justification leads to obedience, not vice versa.

      Dwell on what this means—that you are justified not by any-
      thing you do but only by what Christ has done for you. Why
      is that such good news? How can you learn to make that truth
      your own; that is, to believe it applies to you, personally, no
      matter your struggles, past and even present?
                                                                           41

     The Gospel in the Old Testament
       “And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles
     by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, ‘In you
     shall all the nations be blessed’ ” (Gal. 3:8, ESV). Paul writes that
     not only was the gospel preached to Abraham, but it was God who
     preached it; so, it must have been the true gospel. But when did God
     preach the gospel to Abraham? Paul’s quotation of Genesis 12:3 indi-
     cates he has in mind the covenant that God made with Abraham when
     he called him in Genesis 12:1–3.

Read Genesis 12:1–3. What does this tell us about the nature of the
     covenant that God made with Abraham?

     ________________________________________________________

        The basis of God’s covenant with Abraham centered on God’s
     promises to him. God says to Abraham four times, “I will.” God’s
     promises to Abraham are amazing because they are completely one-
     sided. God does all the promising; Abraham promises nothing. This
     is the opposite of how most people try to relate to God. We usually
     promise we will serve Him, if only He will do something for us in
     return. But that is legalism. God did not ask Abraham to promise any-
     thing but to accept His promises by faith. Of course, that was no easy
     task, because Abraham had to learn to trust completely in God and not
     in himself (see Genesis 22). The call of Abraham illustrates, therefore,
     the essence of the gospel, which is salvation by faith.
        Some mistakenly conclude that the Bible teaches two ways of sal-
     vation. They claim that in Old Testament times salvation was based
     on keeping the commandments; then, because that did not work very
     well, God abolished the law and made salvation possible by faith.
     This could not be farther from the truth. As Paul wrote in Galatians
     1:7, there is only one gospel.

What other examples can you find in the Old Testament of salvation
     by faith alone? See, for instance, Lev. 17:11, Ps. 32:1–5, 2 Sam.
     12:1–13, Zech. 3:1–4.

     ________________________________________________________

      We often hear the phrase “cheap grace.” Yet, it’s a misnomer.
      Grace isn’t cheap—it’s free (at least for us). But we ruin it when
      we think that we can add to it by our works or when we think
      we can use it as an excuse to sin. In your own experience, which
      one of these two ways are you more inclined to lean toward, and
      how can you stop?

     Redeemed From a Curse (Gal. 3:9–14)
        Paul’s opponents were no doubt stunned by his bold words in Galatians
     3:10. They certainly did not think themselves to be under a curse; if
     anything, they expected to be blessed for their obedience. Yet, Paul is
     unequivocal: “For as many as are of the works of the law are under the
     curse; for it is written, ‘Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all
     things which are written in the book of the law, to do them’ ” (NKJV).
        Paul is contrasting two completely different alternatives: salvation by
     faith and salvation by works. The covenant blessings and curses outlined
     in Deuteronomy 27 and 28 were straightforward. Those who obeyed
     were blessed, those who disobeyed were cursed. That means that if a per-
     son wants to rely on obedience to the law for acceptance with God, then
     the whole law needs to be kept. We do not have the liberty to pick and
     choose what we want to follow; nor should we assume that God is willing
     to overlook a few mistakes here and there. It is all or nothing.
        This is, of course, bad news not only for Gentiles but also for Paul’s
     legalistic opponents, because we “all have sinned, and come short of
     the glory of God” (Rom. 3:23). No matter how hard we try to be good,
     the law can only condemn us as lawbreakers.

How did Christ deliver us from the curse of the law? See Gal. 3:13,
     2 Cor. 5:21.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Paul introduces another metaphor to explain what God has done for
     us in Christ. The word redeem means “to buy back.” It was used as
     the ransom price paid to release hostages or as the price paid to free a
     slave. Because the wages of sin is death, the curse of failing to keep
     the law was often a death sentence. The ransom paid for our salvation
     was not insignificant; it cost God the life of His own Son (John 3:16).
     Jesus ransomed us from the curse by becoming our sin-bearer (1 Cor.
     6:20, 7:23). He voluntarily took our curse upon Himself and suffered
     in our behalf the full penalty of sin (2 Cor. 5:21).
        Paul cites Deuteronomy 21:23 as scriptural proof. According to
     Jewish custom, a person was under God’s curse if, after execution,
     the body was hung upon a tree. Jesus’ death on the cross was seen as
     an example of this curse (Acts 5:30, 1 Pet. 2:24).
        No wonder, then, that the cross was a stumbling block for some
     Jews who could not fathom the idea that the Messiah was accursed by
     God. But this was exactly God’s plan. Yes, the Messiah bore a curse,
     but it was not His curse—it was ours!

                                                                           43

    Further Study: “Upon Christ as our substitute and surety was laid
          the iniquity of us all. He was counted a transgressor, that He might
          redeem us from the condemnation of the law. The guilt of every
          descendant of Adam was pressing upon His heart. The wrath of God
          against sin, the terrible manifestation of His displeasure because of
          iniquity, filled the soul of His Son with consternation. All His life
          Christ had been publishing to a fallen world the good news of the
1
          Father’s mercy and pardoning love. Salvation for the chief of sinners
          was His theme. But now with the terrible weight of guilt He bears, He
          cannot see the Father’s reconciling face. The withdrawal of the divine
          countenance from the Saviour in this hour of supreme anguish pierced
          His heart with a sorrow that can never be fully understood by man. So
          great was this agony that His physical pain was hardly felt.
2
            “Satan with his fierce temptations wrung the heart of Jesus. The
          Saviour could not see through the portals of the tomb. Hope did not
          present to Him His coming forth from the grave a conqueror, or tell
          Him of the Father’s acceptance of the sacrifice. He feared that sin was
          so offensive to God that Their separation was to be eternal. Christ felt
          the anguish which the sinner will feel when mercy shall no longer
          plead for the guilty race. It was the sense of sin, bringing the Father’s
          wrath upon Him as man’s substitute, that made the cup He drank so
3
          bitter, and broke the heart of the Son of God.”—Ellen G. White, The
          Desire of Ages, p. 753.

    Discussion Questions:
           l
           1 Even today in our own church, some still have a hard time
           accepting salvation by faith alone—that God’s grace, through
           Christ, saves us, apart from our works. What’s behind the hesi-
           tancy of some to accept this crucial truth?

           l
           2 Paul spoke very strongly about the theological error of salva-
           tion by works. What does that tell us about the importance of
           good theology? Why should we, as a church, stand up, forcefully
           if need be, when error is being taught among us?

    Summary: From start to finish in the Christian life, the basis of our
          salvation is faith in Christ alone. It was because of Abraham’s faith in
          God’s promises that he was counted as righteous, and that same gift
          of righteousness is available for anyone today who shares Abraham’s
          faith. The only reason we are not condemned for our mistakes is that
          Jesus paid the price for our sins by dying in our place.

Unity From Chaos
by Eduarda Araújo
   My family wasn’t religious until my aunt invited my mother to attend
a spirit worship center. My mother was trying to find her way to God, so
she went with my aunt. My mother didn’t really understand what she was
getting into at the spirit center. She didn’t know that these spirits were
not from God, though she was uncomfortable when people called upon
the spirits.
   My father didn’t like the spirit worship either and showed his disap-
proval by attending a traditional church. Church didn’t change my father’s
life however, and he continued drinking. In fact, his drinking increased.
Often he came home drunk. During this time, our family became increas-
ingly unhappy, and mostly it was because of religion.
   My brother and I were taking karate lessons during this time. Our
teacher said all roads lead to God. Then he met a Seventh-day Adventist
and began studying the Bible with him. Before long our teacher was bap-
tized into the Seventh-day Adventist Church. My brother and I noticed
changes in our teacher’s life, and he told us that he had been wrong, that
there is only one way we can find God, and that is through Jesus Christ.
But when he offered to study the Bible with my parents, they refused.
   As the conflicts increased at home, my mother wondered whether
studying the Bible could make a difference in our family. She agreed to
study the Bible with our karate teacher, but my father wanted nothing to
do with studying the Bible.
   My mother became deeply interested in studying the Bible and began
taking my brother and me with her to the studies. Dad wanted to be sure
that we weren’t learning anything we shouldn’t, so he began attending the
Bible studies with us.
   My mother began attending a nearby Seventh-day Adventist church and
took my brother and me with her. At first I didn’t like the idea of going to
church on Saturday, but, in time, I realized that these were God’s choices
for us.
   Eventually, Dad accepted the truth he was learning and attended church
with us. Our family was baptized together. At last our home was united
in Christ.
   I’m thankful that God put people in our lives to help us find Jesus. Your
mission offerings helped lead us to God. Today, I’m studying in a Seventh-
day Adventist academy, where I am learning how to share God’s love with
others. Mission offerings help support my school too. Thank you!

      The Priority of the
      Promise


      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Gal. 3:15–20, Gen. 9:11–17,
      Matt. 5:17–20, Exod. 16:22–26, Gen. 15:1–6.

Memory Text: “For if the inheritance comes by the law, it no lon-
      ger comes by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise”
      (Galatians 3:18, ESV).



      S
             omeone once asked a politician, “Have you kept all the prom-
             ises that you made during the campaign?” He responded, “Yes
             . . . well, at least all the promises that I intended to keep.”
         Who hasn’t, at one time or another, been at one end or the other of
      a broken promise? Who hasn’t been the one to break a promise or the
      one to have a promise made to him or her broken?
         Sometimes people make a promise, fully intending to keep it but,
      later, don’t; others make a promise, knowing—as the sounds leave
      their mouths or the letters their fingers—it’s all a lie.
         Fortunately for us, God’s promises are of an entirely different
      order. God’s Word is sure and unchanging. “ ‘I have spoken, and I
      will bring it to pass; I have purposed, and I will do it,’ ” says the Lord
      (Isa. 46:11, ESV).
         In this week’s lesson, Paul directs our attention to the relationship
      between God’s promise to Abraham and the law given to Israel 430
      years later. How should the relationship between the two be under-
      stood, and what implications does that have for the preaching of the
      gospel?

      Law and Faith (Gal. 3:15–18)
        			
        Even if his opponents conceded that Abraham’s life was characterized
      primarily by faith, Paul knew that they still would have questions about
      why God gave the law to Israel about four centuries after Abraham. Did
      not the giving of the law nullify any previous arrangement?

What is the point of Paul’s analogy between a person’s final will and
      testament and God’s covenant with Abraham? Gal. 3:15–18.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         A covenant and a will are generally different. A covenant is typi-
      cally a mutual agreement between two or more people, often called a
      “contract” or “treaty”; in contrast, a will is the declaration of a single
      person. The Greek translation of the Old Testament, the Septuagint,
      never translates God’s covenant with Abraham with the Greek word
      used for mutual agreements or contracts (syntheke). Instead, it uses
      the word for a testament or a will (diatheke). Why? Probably because
      the translators recognized that God’s covenant with Abraham was not
      a treaty between two individuals where mutually binding promises are
      made. On the contrary, God’s covenant was based on nothing other
      than His own will. No string of “ifs, ands, or buts” was attached.
      Abraham was simply to take God at His word.
         Paul picks up on this double meaning of “will” and “covenant” in
      order to highlight specific features of God’s covenant with Abraham.
      As with a human will, God’s promise concerns a specific beneficiary,
      Abraham and his offspring (Gen. 12:1–5, Gal. 3:16); it also involves an
      inheritance (Gen. 13:15, 17:8, Rom. 4:13, Gal. 3:29). Most important
      to Paul is the unchanging nature of God’s promise. In the same way that
      a person’s will cannot be changed once it has been put into force, so the
      giving of the law through Moses cannot simply nullify God’s previous
      covenant with Abraham. God’s covenant is a promise (Gal. 3:16), and
      by no means is God a promise-breaker (Isa. 46:11, Heb. 6:18).

       Replace the word covenant with promise in the following pas-
       sages. What is the nature of the “covenant” in each passage?
       How does understanding God’s covenant as a promise make the
       meaning of the passage clearer, and how does it help us under-
       stand better what a covenant is? Gen. 9:11–17, 15:18, 17:1–21.
       What does this also teach us about the character of God and
       how we can trust Him?
                                                                            47
                M onday October 31

     Faith and Law (Rom. 3:31)
       Paul has argued strongly for the supremacy of faith in a person’s
     relationship with God. He has repeatedly stated that neither circum-
     cision nor any other “works of law” are a prerequisite to salvation,
     “because by works of the law no one will be justified” (Gal. 2:16,
     ESV). Moreover, it is not the works of the law but faith that is the
     defining mark of the believer (Gal. 3:7). This repeated negation of the
     works of the law raises the question, “Does the law have absolutely no
     value, then? Did God do away with the law?”

Because salvation is by faith and not by works of law, does Paul
     mean to say that faith abolishes the law? What do the following
     texts tell us? Compare Rom. 3:31 with Rom. 7:7, 12; 8:3 and Matt.
     5:17–20.
     ________________________________________________________
     ________________________________________________________

        Paul’s argument in Romans 3 parallels his discussion about faith
     and law in Galatians. Sensing that his comments might lead some to
     conclude that he is exalting faith at the expense of the law, Paul asks
     the rhetorical question, “Do we then overthrow the law by this faith?”
     (ESV). The word translated as “overthrow” in Romans 3:31 (ESV) is
     katargeo. Paul uses the word frequently, and it can be translated as
     “to nullify” (Rom. 3:3, ESV), “to abolish” (Eph. 2:15), “to be brought to
     nothing” (Rom. 6:6, ESV), or even as “to destroy” (1 Cor. 6:13). Clearly,
     if Paul wanted to endorse the idea that the law was somehow done away
     with at the cross, as some people today claim he taught, this would have
     been the time. But Paul not only denies that sentiment with an emphatic
     no, he actually states that his gospel “establishes” the law!
        “The plan of justification by faith reveals God’s regard for His law in
     demanding and providing the atoning sacrifice. If justification by faith
     abolishes law, then there was no need for the atoning death of Christ to
     release the sinner from his sins, and thus restore him to peace with God.
        “Moreover, genuine faith implies in itself an unreserved willingness
     to fulfill the will of God in a life of obedience to His law. . . . Real
     faith, based on wholehearted love for the Saviour, can lead only to
     obedience.”—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 510.

      Think through the implications if Paul did, indeed, mean that
      faith nullifies the need to keep the law. Would then, for instance,
      adultery no longer be sin or stealing or even murder? Think
      about the sorrow, pain, and suffering you could spare yourself if
      you merely obeyed God’s law. What suffering have you or others
      gone through as a result of disobedience to God’s law?

      The Purpose of the Law
In Galatians 3:19–29 Paul makes multiple references to “the law.” To
      what law is Paul primarily referring in this section of Galatians?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Some, believing that the word until in verse 19 (ESV) indicates that
      this law was only temporary, have thought the passage must refer to
      the ceremonial law, since the purpose of that law was fulfilled at the
      cross and thus came to an end. Although this makes sense by itself, it
      does not appear to be Paul’s point in Galatians. While both the cere-
      monial and moral law were “added” at Sinai because of transgression,
      we will see by considering the following question that Paul appears to
      have the moral law primarily in mind.

Does Paul say that the law was added? To what was it added, and
      why? Compare Gal. 3:19 and Rom. 5:13, 20.

      ________________________________________________________

        Paul is not saying that the law was added to God’s covenant with
      Abraham as if it were some sort of addendum to a will that altered
      the original provisions. The law had been in existence long before
      Sinai (see tomorrow’s lesson). Paul means, instead, that the law was
      given to Israel for an entirely different purpose. It was to redirect the
      people back to God and the grace He offers all who come to Him
      by faith. The law reveals to us our sinful condition and our need of
      God’s grace. The law was not intended to be some kind of program
      for “earning” salvation. On the contrary, it was given, Paul says, “to
      increase the trespass” (Rom. 5:20, ESV); that is, to show us more
      clearly the sin in our lives (Rom. 7:13).
        While the ceremonial laws pointed to the Messiah and emphasized
      holiness and the need of a Savior, it is the moral law, with its “Thou
      shall nots,” that reveals sin, that shows us that sin is not just a part of
      our natural condition but is, indeed, a violation of God’s law (Rom.
      3:20; 5:13, 20; 7:7, 8, 13). This is why Paul says, “Where there is no
      law there is no transgression” (Rom. 4:15, ESV). “The law acts as a
      magnifying glass. That device does not actually increase the number
      of dirty spots that defile a garment, but makes them stand out more

     The Duration of God’s Law
Does Paul’s statement about the law being added at Mount Sinai
     mean that it did not exist previously? If not, what was the differ-
     ence before and after Mount Sinai? Read Gen. 9:5, 6; 18:19; 26:5;
     39:7–10; Exod. 16:22–26.


        God did not need to reveal His law to Abraham with thunder,
     lightning, and a penalty of death (Exod. 19:10–23). Why, then, did
     God give the law to the Israelites in that manner? It was because,
     during their bondage in Egypt, the Israelites had lost sight of God’s
     greatness and His high moral standards. As a result, they needed to be
     made aware of the extent of their own sinfulness and the sacredness
     of God’s law. The revelation at Sinai certainly did just that.

What does Paul mean when he says the law was added “until the
     offspring should come to whom the promise had been made”?
     Gal. 3:16–19 (ESV).


        Many have understood this text to mean that the law given at Mount
     Sinai was temporary. It entered 430 years after Abraham and ended
     when Christ came. This interpretation, however, conflicts with what
     Paul says about the law in Romans, as well as other passages in the
     Bible, such as Matthew 5:17–19.
        The mistake readers often make with this passage is to assume
     that the word until always implies a limited duration of time. This is
     not the case. Describing the person who fears the Lord, Psalm 112:8
     (ESV) says, “His heart is steady; he will not be afraid, until he looks
     in triumph on his adversaries.” Does this mean that when he triumphs
     he will become afraid? In Revelation 2:25 (ESV) Jesus says, “Only
     hold fast what you have until I come.” Does Jesus mean that once He
     comes we no longer need to be faithful?
        The role of the law did not end with the coming of Christ. It will
     continue to point out sin as long as the law exists. What Paul is saying
     is that the coming of Christ marks a decisive turning point in human
     history. Christ can do what the law could never do—provide a true
     remedy for sin, that is, justify sinners and, by His Spirit, fulfill His
     law in them (Rom. 8:3, 4).

      Have you ever thought to yourself, If only the Lord did this for me,
      or that, or the other, then I would never again doubt or question
      Him? Think, though, about what happened at Sinai, about how
      powerful a manifestation of God’s power the Israelites saw—and
      yet, still, what did they do? What should this tell you about what
50    true faith is and how we obtain and maintain it? (See Col. 2:6.)

     The Superiority of the Promise		
        “ ‘He was in the assembly in the desert, with the angel who
     spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our fathers; and he
     received living words to pass on to us’ ” (Acts 7:38, NIV).
        								
         In Galatians 3:19, 20, Paul continues his train of thought about
     how the law does not nullify the covenant of grace; this is important
     because, if the theology of his opponents were correct, the law would
     do just that. Think, then, what our position as sinners would be if we
     had to rely on our law-keeping, as opposed to God’s grace, to save us.
     We would, in the end, be without hope.
        Although the details of Paul’s comments in Galatians 3:19, 20 are
     difficult, his basic point is clear: the law is subsidiary to the promise,
     because it was mediated through angels and Moses. The connection
     of angels to the giving of the law is not mentioned in Exodus, but it is
     found in several other places in Scripture (Deut. 33:2; Acts 7:38, 53;
     Heb. 2:2). Paul uses the word mediator in 1 Timothy 2:5 in reference
     to Christ, but his comments here strongly suggest he has Deuteronomy
     5:5 (ESV) in mind, where Moses says, “I stood between the Lord and
     you at that time, to declare to you the word of the Lord.”
        As majestic as the giving of the law was on Sinai, with countless
     angels in attendance, and as important as Moses was as the lawgiver,
     the giving of the law was indirect. In stark contrast, God’s promise
     was made directly to Abraham (and, therefore, to all believers), for
     there was no need for a mediator. In the end, however important the
     law, it is no substitute for the promise of salvation through grace by
     faith. On the contrary, the law helps us to better understand just how
     wonderful that promise really is.

Describe the nature of Abraham’s direct encounters with God.
     What benefit was there to such immediacy with God? Consider
     Gen. 15:1–6, 18:1–33, 22:1–18.

      you haven’t experienced anything as dramatic, but in what ways
      has God revealed Himself to you? Ask yourself, too, whether
      anything in your personal life might prevent you from having
      the kind of intimacy and immediacy that Abraham experienced
      with God. If so, what steps can you take to change?

    Further Study: “In their bondage the people had to a great extent
         lost the knowledge of God and of the principles of the Abrahamic
         covenant. In delivering them from Egypt, God sought to reveal to
         them His power and His mercy, that they might be led to love and
         trust Him. He brought them down to the Red Sea—where, pursued
1
         by the Egyptians, escape seemed impossible—that they might realize
         their utter helplessness, their need of divine aid; and then He wrought
         deliverance for them. Thus they were filled with love and gratitude to
         God and with confidence in His power to help them. He had bound
         them to Himself as their deliverer from temporal bondage.
            “But there was a still greater truth to be impressed upon their
2        minds. Living in the midst of idolatry and corruption, they had no
         true conception of the holiness of God, of the exceeding sinfulness of
         their own hearts, their utter inability, in themselves, to render obedi-
         ence to God’s law, and their need of a Saviour. All this they must be
         taught.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 371.
            “The law of God, spoken in awful grandeur from Sinai, is the utter-
         ance of condemnation to the sinner. It is the province of the law to
         condemn, but there is in it no power to pardon or to redeem.”—Ellen

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Think about this whole idea of promises, especially broken
          ones. How did you feel about those who broke their promise
          to you? How much difference did it make whether a person
          intended to keep it and then either couldn’t, or changed his or
          her mind, or if you realized that the person never meant to keep
          it? What happened to your level of trust after the promise was
          broken, whatever the reason? What does it mean to you to know
          that you can trust God’s promises? Or perhaps the question
          should be, How can you learn to trust God’s promises in the
          first place?

          l
          2 In what ways are we in danger of being corrupted by our
          environment to the point that we lose sight of the important
          truths God has given us? How can we make ourselves aware of
          just what those corrupting influences are, and then how can we
          counteract them?

    Summary: The giving of the law on Sinai did not invalidate the
         promise that God made to Abraham, nor did the law alter the prom-
         ise’s provisions. The law was given so that people might be made
         aware of the true extent of their sinfulness and recognize their need of
         God’s promise to Abraham and his descendants.

God’s Perfect Plan
by Chinamo Mashiri
   I’m from Zambia. My parents died when I was little, and my aunt and
uncle took me in. They sent me to a boarding school to study. There I
met some Seventh-day Adventist students who shared their faith with me.
They taught me about God from the Bible, and I decided to attend church
with them.
   When I returned home for summer, I told my aunt and uncle what I had
learned. They were angry and threatened to send me away from home, so
I kept silent about my faith. They wouldn’t let me attend the Seventh-day
Adventist church.
   Back at school, my Seventh-day Adventist friends continued teaching
me, and I asked to be baptized. When I returned home and explained my
faith to my family, they allowed me to attend the Seventh-day Adventist
church. But when I returned to school, I discovered that my uncle was no
longer paying my tuition. I didn’t know what to do, except pray.
   Every quarter I expected to be sent away from school, but it was as if
the registrar overlooked my balance and I was allowed to register. By
God’s grace and with the help of friends at church, I graduated from high
school.
   I wanted to become a pastor, but I didn’t see how I could. So I found a
job and began saving money for university. I worked for a year, but I still
didn’t have enough money to enroll in school.
   Then I learned that Zambia Adventist University had just opened, so I
applied to study theology. Because it was a new school, there was much
work to be done on the campus. I gladly worked six hours a day to help
pay my school fees.
   I couldn’t afford to live in the dormitory, so some other students and
I found another place to live—a chicken coop that we converted into a
room. We cooked our rice and vegetables over a fire and managed to live
this way while we studied to become ministers.
   God sustained me, and I’ve finished my pastoral training. I praise God
for making a way when there appeared to be no way. I see how God has
provided for me, and I know He will continue to lead me. He is so faith-
ful!
   A recent Thirteenth Sabbath Offering has helped construct a library on
the campus of Zambia Adventist University. Little by little, the school is
taking shape. It is God’s school, and I praise Him for your generosity in
helping this dream to become a reality.

               oming pigeons long have been known for their ability to fly
               hundreds of miles a day and arrive at their destination with
               amazing accuracy. Yet, even the best homing pigeons at times
      have become disoriented, never returning to their starting point. The
      worst incident happened in England, when about twenty thousand
      birds (valued at more than six hundred thousand dollars) never came
      back to their lofts.
         As most of us have experienced in one way or another, being dis-
      oriented, or lost, is not enjoyable. It fills us with fear and anxiety; it
      can lead us to moments of panic, as well.
         The same is true in the spiritual realm. Even after we accept Christ,
      we can get lost, or disoriented, even to the point of never returning
      to the Lord.
         The good news is, however, that God has not left us to ourselves. He
      has mapped out the road to faith, as revealed in the gospel, and that path
      includes the law. Many people try to separate the law from the gospel;
      some even see them as contradictory. Not only is this view wrong, it
      can have tragic consequences. Without the law we would have no gospel.
      It’s hard, really, to understand the gospel without the law.

     The Law and the Promise
       “Is the law then contrary to the promises of God?” (Gal. 3:21,
     ESV).
        			
       Sensing that his comments might lead his opponents to conclude
     he had a disparaging view of the law, or that his comments about
     the priority of God’s promises were just a veiled put-down of Moses
     and the Torah, Paul asks the very question they were thinking: “Are
     you saying the law contradicts the promises of God?” To this Paul
     responds with an emphatic, “No!” Such a conclusion is impossible,
     because God is not opposed to Himself. God gave both the promise
     and the law. The law is not at odds with the promise. The two merely
     have different roles and functions in God’s overall plan of salvation.

What mistaken concepts did Paul’s opponents have about the role of
     the law? Compare Gal. 3:21, Lev. 18:5, and Deut. 6:24.
     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        These people believed that the law was able to give them spiritual
     life. Their views probably arose out of a mistaken interpretation of Old
     Testament passages such as Leviticus 18:5 and Deuteronomy 6:24, where
     the law directs how life should be lived by those abiding in God’s cove-
     nant. The law did regulate life within the covenant, but they concluded
     that the law was the source of a person’s relationship with God. The Bible
     is clear, however, that the ability to “make alive” is a power exercised by
     God and His Spirit alone (2 Kings 5:7, Neh. 9:6, John 5:21, Rom. 4:17).
     The law cannot make anyone alive spiritually. This does not mean, how-
     ever, that the law is opposed to God’s promise.
        Seeking to prove the inability of the law to give life, Paul writes
     in Galatians 3:22, “Scripture has confined all under sin” (ESV). In
     Romans 3:9–19, Paul draws from a string of verses extracted from the
     Old Testament to show just how sinful we are. The passages are not
     strung together in a haphazard manner. He begins with the heart of
     the sin problem—the selfish attitude that plagues human hearts—and
     then moves to verses that describe sin’s pervasiveness and finally its
     universality.
        His point? Because of the extent of sin and the limitations of the
     law, the promise of eternal life can come to us only through the faith-
     fulness of Christ in our behalf.

      Although the law cannot save us, what great benefits does our
      adherence to it have for us? That is, what practical good have you
      experienced in your own life through obedience to God’s law?
                                                                            57

     “Kept Under Law”
        In Galatians 3:23, Paul writes that “before faith came, we were kept
     under the law.” By “we” Paul is referring to the Jewish believers in
     the Galatian churches. They are the ones acquainted with the law, and
     Paul has been speaking to them in particular since Galatians 2:15.
     This can be seen in the contrast between the “we” in Galatians 3:23
     and the “you” in Galatians 3:26 (ESV).
        Galatians 3:23 reads, “Before faith came”; but in the literal Greek it
     reads, “before the faith came.” Because Paul is contrasting the place
     of the law before and after Christ (Gal. 3:24), “the faith” is most
     likely a reference to Jesus Himself and not a reference to Christian
     faith in general.

Paul says the Jews were kept “under the law” before the coming of
     Christ. What does he mean by “under the law”? Compare Gal.
     3:22, 23 with Rom. 6:14, 15; 1 Cor. 9:20; Gal. 4:4, 5, 21; 5:18.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Paul uses the phrase “under the law” twelve times in his letters.
     Depending on its context, it can have a couple of different connotations.
        1. “Under the law” as an alternative way of salvation (Gal. 4:21).
     The opponents in Galatia were trying to gain life-giving righteousness
     by obedience. However, as Paul has already made clear, this is impos-
     sible (Gal. 3:21, 22). Paul later will even point out that, by desiring
     to be under the law, the Galatians were really rejecting Christ (Gal.
     5:2–4).
        2. “Under the law” in the sense of being under its condemnation
     (Rom. 6:14, 15). Because the law cannot atone for sin, the violation of
     its demands ultimately results in condemnation. This is the condition
     in which all human beings find themselves. The law acts as a prison
     warden, locking up all who have violated it and brought upon them-
     selves the sentence of death. As we will see in tomorrow’s lesson, the
     use of the word guard (Gal. 3:23, NKJV) indicates that this is what
     Paul means by “under the law” in this passage.
        A related Greek word, ennomos, normally translated as “under the
     law,” literally means “within the law” and refers to living within the
     requirements of the law through union with Christ (1 Cor. 9:21). By
     “the works of the law,” that is, by trying to keep the law apart from
     Christ, it is impossible to be justified, because only those who through
     faith are righteous will live (Gal. 3:11). This truth doesn’t nullify the
     law; it shows only that the law can’t give us eternal life. It’s way too
     late for that.

                T uesday November 8

     The Law as Our “Guard”
       Paul gives two basic conclusions about the law: (1) the law does not
     nullify or abolish God’s promise made to Abraham (Gal. 3:15–20);
     (2) the law is not opposed to the promise (Gal. 3:21, 22).
       What role does the law actually play then? Paul writes that it was
     added “because of transgressions” (Gal. 3:19), and he expands on this
     idea using three different words or phrases in connection to the law:
     kept (vs. 23), shut up (vs. 23), and schoolmaster (vs. 24).

Read prayerfully and carefully Galatians 3:19–24. What is Paul say-
     ing about the law?
       					

        Most modern translations interpret Paul’s comments about the law in
     Galatians 3:19 in wholly negative terms. But the original Greek is not
     nearly so one-sided. The Greek word translated as “kept” (vs. 23) literally
     means “to guard.” Although it can be used in a negative sense, as to “hold
     in subjection” or to “watch over” (2 Cor. 11:32), in the New Testament
     it generally has a more positive sense of “protecting” or “keeping” (Phil.
     4:7, 1 Pet. 1:5). The same is true of the word translated as “shut up” (Gal.
     3:23). It can be translated “to close” (Gen. 20:18), “to shut” (Exod. 14:3,
     Josh. 6:1, Jer. 13:19), “to enclose” (Luke 5:6), or “to confine” (Rom.
     11:32). As these examples indicate, depending on its context, this word
     can have either positive or negative connotations.

What benefits did the law (moral and ceremonial) provide the chil-
     dren of Israel? Rom. 3:1, 2; Deut. 7:12–24; Lev. 18:20–30.


        While Paul can speak about the law in negative terms (Rom. 7:6,
     Gal. 2:19), he also has many positive things to say about it (see Rom.
     7:12, 14; 8:3, 4; 13:8). The law was not a curse that God placed upon
     Israel; on the contrary, it was intended to be a blessing. Although its
     sacrificial system could not ultimately remove sin, it pointed to the
     promised Messiah who could; and its laws guiding human behavior
     protected Israel from many of the vices that plagued other ancient
     civilizations. In light of Paul’s positive comments about the law else-
     where, it would be a mistake to understand his comments here in a
     completely negative way.

      Think of something good that is misused. For example, a drug
      created to treat a disease could be used by some people to get
      high. What examples have you seen in your own life of this prin-
      ciple? How does our knowledge of how something good can be
      misused help us to understand what Paul is dealing with here?
                                                                             59

      The Law as Our Schoolmaster
In Galatians 3:23, Paul describes the law as a guarding and protecting
      force. To what does he liken it in verse 24, and what does that
      mean?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         The word translated “schoolmaster” (KJV) comes from the Greek
      word paidagogos. Some versions translate it as “disciplinarian”
      (NRSV), “tutor” (NKJV), or even “guardian” (ESV), but no single
      word fully can encompass its meaning. The paidagogos was a slave
      in Roman society who was placed in a position of authority over
      his master’s sons from the time they turned six or seven until they
      reached maturity. In addition to providing for his charges’ physical
      needs, such as drawing their bath, providing them with food and
      clothes, and protecting them from any danger, the paidagogos also
      was responsible for making sure the master’s sons went to school and
      did their homework. In addition, he was expected not only to teach
      and practice moral virtues but also to ensure that the boys learned and
      practiced the virtues themselves.
         Although some pedagogues must certainly have been kind, as well
      as loved by their wards, the dominant description of them in ancient
      literature is as strict disciplinarians. They ensured obedience not only
      through harsh threats and rebukes but also by whipping and caning.
         Paul’s description of the law as it refers to a pedagogue further
      clarifies his understanding of the role of the law. The law was added
      to point out sin and provide instruction. The very nature of this task
      means that the law also has a negative aspect, and that’s because it
      rebukes and condemns us as sinners. Yet, even this “negative” aspect
      God uses for our benefit, because the condemnation that the law
      brings is what drives us to Christ. Thus, the law and the gospel are not
      contradictory. God designed them to work together for our salvation.
         “In this Scripture [Gal. 3:24], the Holy Spirit through the apostle is
      speaking especially of the moral law. The law reveals sin to us, and
      causes us to feel our need of Christ and to flee unto Him for pardon and
      peace by exercising repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord
      Jesus Christ.”—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 234.

       When was the last time you compared your actions and words
       and thoughts to the law? Do it now, comparing them not just to
       the letter of the law but also to the spirit (Matt. 5:28, Rom. 7:6).
       How well do you fare? What does your answer tell you about
       Paul’s point in this epistle?

     The Law and the Believer (Gal. 3:25)
        Many have interpreted Paul’s comment in Galatians 3:25 as a com-
     plete dismissal of the law. This makes little sense, however, in light of
     Paul’s positive comments about the law elsewhere in the Bible.
        What does he, then, mean?
        First, we are no longer under the law’s condemnation (Rom. 8:3).
     As believers, we are in Christ and enjoying the privilege of being
     under grace (Rom. 6:14, 15). That gives us the liberty of serving
     Christ wholeheartedly, without fear of being condemned for mistakes
     we might make in the process. This is what true liberty and freedom
     in the gospel is, which is something radically different from no longer
     having to obey the law—which is what some people claim is “free-
     dom” in Christ. But disobedience to the law, instead, is sin—and sin
     is anything but freedom (John 8:34).

Read Romans 8:1–3. What does it mean to be no longer condemned
     by the law? How should this wonderful truth impact how we
     live?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       As a result of being forgiven through Christ, our relationship to
     the law is now different. We are now called to live a life that is
     pleasing to Him (1 Thess. 4:1); Paul refers to this as walking in the
     Spirit (Gal. 5:18). This does not mean that the moral law is no longer
     applicable—that was never the issue. How could it be when we have
     seen so clearly that the law is what defines sin?
       Instead, because the law is a transcript of God’s character, by obey-
     ing the law we simply reflect His character. But more than that, we
     follow not just a set of rules but the example of Jesus, who does for
     us what the law itself could never do: He writes the law on our hearts
     (Heb. 8:10) and makes it possible for the righteous requirement of the
     law to be fulfilled in us (Rom. 8:4). That is, through our relationship
     with Jesus, we have the power to obey the law as never before.

      Read Romans 8:4. What is Paul saying here? How have you
      seen this promise manifested in your own life? At the same
      time, despite whatever positive changes you have experienced,
      why must salvation always be based on what Christ has done
      for us and nothing else?

                                                                          61

    Further Study: “I am asked concerning the law in Galatians. What
          law is the schoolmaster to bring us to Christ? I answer: Both the
          ceremonial and the moral code of ten commandments.
             “Christ was the foundation of the whole Jewish economy. The death
          of Abel was in consequence of Cain’s refusing to accept God’s plan in
          the school of obedience to be saved by the blood of Jesus Christ typi-
          fied by the sacrificial offerings pointing to Christ. Cain refused the
          shedding of blood which symbolized the blood of Christ to be shed
          for the world. This whole ceremony was prepared by God, and Christ
1         became the foundation of the whole system. This is the beginning of
          its work as the schoolmaster to bring sinful human agents to a consid-
          eration of Christ the Foundation of the whole Jewish economy.
             “All who did service in connection with the sanctuary were being
          educated constantly in regard to the intervention of Christ in behalf of
          the human race. This service was designed to create in every heart a
2         love for the law of God, which is the law of His kingdom.”—Ellen G.
          White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 233.
             “The law of ten commandments is not to be looked upon as much
          from the prohibitory side, as from the mercy side. Its prohibitions are
          the sure guarantee of happiness in obedience. As received in Christ,
          it works in us the purity of character that will bring joy to us through
          eternal ages. To the obedient it is a wall of protection.”—Ellen G.
          White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 235.

    Discussion Questions:
           l1 We often struggle with the question of how we can overcome
           sin in our lives. What promises do we have in the Bible about
           victory over sin? How can we better position ourselves to help
           make these promises real? At the same time, why must we be so
           careful to make sure that we place our full hope of salvation not
           on whatever victories we get but on Christ’s victory for us?

           l
           2 We often hear Christians claim that the law has been done
           away with. Of course, these same Christians will speak out
           against sin, which means, of course, that they really don’t mean
           the law has been done away with. What, in fact, do they really
           mean by that claim? (Hint: In the context of what command-
           ment does that claim usually arise?)

    Summary: The law was given to point sinners to their need of Christ.
          As a custodian, it provides instruction about God and protection from
          evil. But, like a disciplinarian, it also points out our sinfulness and
          brings condemnation. Christ frees us from the law’s condemnation
          and writes His law upon our hearts.

Someone Is Watching
by David Zhang
   I grew up in China, where religion wasn’t a part of our lives except as
we honored our ancestors during special times of the year. I moved to
New Zealand when I was 12 years old and had to learn English. I also
began learning a bit about God in the weekly Bible classes offered in New
Zealand’s schools.
   I enjoyed hearing Bible stories and liked to draw pictures of Bible char-
acters. The teachers didn’t tell us we had to believe in God; they just told
us Bible stories and let us draw our own conclusions. For me this religious
training was just a bunch of interesting stories.
   When I entered high school, I asked some of my friends how they felt
about God. Some of my friends were quite religious and went to church
regularly. I asked them casual questions while were we hanging out
together, and in this way I learned a little more about God.
   Little by little, I realized that religion should be more than simply a
belief in God and you’ll go to heaven, as some friends said. One friend
told me that God has a plan for all of us, and this made me think. If God
really does have a plan for me, what does He expect of me? Is the God
my religious friends talked about the same God who made the world? Or
was Creation an accident?
   My Seventh-day Adventist friends seemed to know the most about
what they believed and acted in accordance to their beliefs. So when one
of my friends invited me to his church, I went. I had never been inside a
Christian church before, so I watched what the people did. He invited me
back again, and I went. Then he invited me to go with him to youth camp.
There I learned much about what it means to be a Christian. I learned how
to study the Bible and expressed my faith in Jesus.
   When I told my parents I had become a Christian, they nodded. They
don’t know a lot about what it means to be a Christian, so I explain to
them what I’m learning. They listen and sometimes ask me questions
about what I believe.
   My friends led me to Christ through their professions of faith, their life-
styles, their words, and their conduct. I’m learning to live my faith as they
do, trusting Christ to make me a new creature. It’s sometimes difficult, but
God is patiently teaching me, and I am willing to learn. I urge others to be
aware that people are watching them.

      From Slaves to Heirs




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Gal. 3:26–4:20; Rom.
      6:1–11; Heb. 2:14–18; 4:14, 15; Rom. 9:4, 5.

Memory Text: “So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son,
      then an heir through God” (Galatians 4:7, ESV).



      P
             aul tells the Galatians that they should not live and act as slaves
             but as the sons and daughters of God, with all the rights and
             privileges thereof. Their situation was similar to the story of
      a discouraged new convert who came to talk with Chinese Christian
      Watchman Nee.
         “ ‘No matter how much I pray, no matter how hard I try, I simply
      cannot seem to be faithful to my Lord. I think I’m losing my salva-
      tion.’ Nee said, ‘Do you see this dog here? He is my dog. He is house-
      trained; he never makes a mess; he is obedient; he is a pure delight to
      me. Out in the kitchen I have a son, a baby son. He makes a mess,
      he throws his food around, he fouls his clothes, he is a total mess.
      But who is going to inherit my kingdom? Not my dog; my son is
      my heir. You are Jesus Christ’s heir because it is for you that He
      died.’ ”—Lou Nicholes, Hebrews: Patterns for Living (Longwood, Fla.:
      Xulon Press, 2004), p. 31.
         We, too, are God’s heirs, not because of our own merit but because
      of His grace. In Christ we have much more than we even had before
      Adam’s sin; this is one of the points that Paul was trying desperately
      to teach the Galatian believers, who were fast losing their way.

      Our Condition in Christ (Gal. 3:26–29)
Keeping Galatians 3:25 in mind, read Galatians 3:26. How does
      this text help us to understand our relationship to the law, now
      that we have been redeemed by Jesus?


        The word for at the beginning of verse 26 indicates that Paul sees
      a direct connection between this verse and the preceding one. In the
      same way that a master’s son was under a pedagogue only as long
      as he was a minor, Paul is saying that those who come to faith in
      Christ are no longer minors; their relationship with the law is changed
      because they are now adult “sons” of God.
        The term son is not, of course, exclusive to males; Paul clearly
      includes females in this category (Gal 3:28). The reason he uses the
      word sons instead of children is that he has in mind the family inheri-
      tance that was passed on to the male offspring, along with the fact that
      the phrase “sons of God” was the special designation of Israel in the Old
      Testament (Deut. 14:1, Hos. 11:1). In Christ, Gentiles now also enjoy
      the special relationship with God that had been exclusive to Israel.

What is it about baptism that makes it such a significant event? Gal.
      3:27, 28; Rom. 6:1–11; 1 Pet. 3:21.


         Paul’s use of the word for in verse 27 indicates once again the close
      logical development of his reasoning. Paul sees baptism as a radical
      decision to unite our lives with Christ. In Romans 6, he describes
      baptism symbolically as our uniting with Jesus, in both His death and
      His resurrection. In Galatians, Paul employs a different metaphor:
      baptism is the act of being clothed with Christ. Paul’s terminology
      is reminiscent of wonderful passages in the Old Testament that talk
      about being clothed with righteousness and salvation (see Isa. 61:10,
      Job 29:14). “Paul views baptism as the moment when Christ, like
      a garment, envelops the believer. Although he does not employ the
      term, Paul is describing the righteousness which is conferred upon
      believers.”—Frank J. Matera, Galatians (Collegeville, Minn.: The
      Liturgical Press, 1992), p. 145.
         Our union with Christ symbolized through baptism means that what is
      true of Christ also is true of us. Because Christ is the “seed” of Abraham,
      as “joint-heirs with Christ” (Rom. 8:17), believers also are heirs to all the
      covenant promises made to Abraham and his descendants.

       Dwell on this thought that what is true of Christ is also true of
       us. How should this amazing truth affect every aspect of our
       existence?
                                                                               65

     Enslaved to Elementary Principles
        Having just compared our relationship to God with that of sons and
     heirs, Paul now elaborates on this metaphor by including the theme of
     inheritance in Galatians 4:1–3. Paul’s terminology evokes a situation
     in which an owner of a large estate has died, leaving all his property
     to his oldest son. His son, however, is still a minor. As is often the
     case with wills even today, the father’s will stipulates that his son is to
     be under the supervision of guardians and managers until he reaches
     maturity. Although he is master of his father’s estate by title, as a
     minor he is little more than a slave in practice.
        Paul’s analogy is similar to that of the pedagogue in Galations 3:24,
     but in this case the power of the stewards and managers is far supe-
     rior and much more important. They are responsible not only for the
     upbringing of the master’s son, but they are also in charge of all the
     financial and administrative affairs until the son is mature enough to
     assume those duties himself.

Read Galatians 4:1–3. What is Paul saying here that, again, should
     help to clarify what the role of the law should be in our lives, now
     that we are in Christ?

     ________________________________________________________

        Exactly what Paul means by the phrase “elementary principles” (Gal.
     4:3, 8, ESV) is disputed. The Greek word stoicheia literally means
     “elements.” Some have seen it as a description of the basic elements
     that compose the universe (2 Pet. 3:10, 12), or as demonic powers that
     control this evil age (Col. 2:15), or as the rudimentary principles of
     religious life—the ABCs of religion (Heb. 5:12). Paul’s emphasis on
     humanity’s status as “minors” before the coming of Christ (Gal. 4:1–3)
     suggests that he is referring here to the rudimentary principles of reli-
     gious life. If so, Paul is saying that the Old Testament period, with its
     laws and sacrifices, was merely a gospel primer that outlined the basics
     of salvation. Thus, as important and instructional as the ceremonial
     laws were to Israel, they were only shadows of what was to come. They
     never were intended to take the place of Christ.
        To regulate one’s life around these rules instead of Christ is like
     wanting to go back in time. For the Galatians to return to those basic
     elements after Christ had already come was like the adult son in
     Paul’s analogy wanting to be a minor again!

      While a childlike faith can be positive (Matt. 18:3), is it neces-
      sarily the same thing as spiritual maturity? Or could you argue
      that the more you grow spiritually, the more childlike your
      faith will be? How childlike and “innocent” and trusting is your
66    faith?

     “God Sent Forth His Son” (Gal. 4:4)
       “But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his
     Son, born of woman, born under the law” (Gal. 4:4, ESV).

       Paul’s choice of the word fullness indicates God’s active role in
     working out His purpose in human history. Jesus did not come at just
     any time; He came at the precise time God had prepared. From a his-
     torical perspective, that time is known as the Pax Romana (the Roman
     Peace), a two-hundred-year period of relative stability and peace
     across the Roman Empire. Rome’s conquest of the Mediterranean
     world brought peace, a common language, favorable means of travel,
     and a common culture that facilitated the rapid spread of the gospel.
     From a biblical perspective, it also marked the time that God had set
     for the coming of the promised Messiah (see Dan. 9:24–27).

Why did Christ have to take our humanity in order to redeem us?
     John 1:14; Gal. 4:4, 5; Rom. 8:3, 4; 2 Cor. 5:21; Phil. 2:5–8; Heb.
     2:14–18; 4:14, 15.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Galatians 4:4, 5 contains one of the most succinct accounts of the
     gospel in Scripture. The coming of Jesus into human history was no
     accident. “God sent forth His Son.” In other words, God took the
     initiative in our salvation.
        Also implicit in these words is the fundamental Christian belief in
     Christ’s eternal deity (John 1:1–3, 18; Phil. 2:5–9; Col. 1:15–17).
     God did not send a heavenly messenger. He, Himself, came.
        Although He was the divine preexistent Son of God, Jesus was also
     “born of woman.” Although the virgin birth is implied in this phrase,
     it more specifically affirms His genuine humanity.
        The phrase “born under the law” points not only to Jesus’ Jewish
     heritage, but also includes the fact that He bore our condemnation.
        It was necessary for Christ to assume our humanity because we
     could not save ourselves. By uniting His divine nature with our fallen
     human nature, Christ legally qualified to be our Substitute, Savior,
     and High Priest. As the second Adam, He came to reclaim all that
     the first Adam had lost by his disobedience (Rom. 5:12–21). By His
     obedience He perfectly fulfilled the law’s demands, thus redeeming
     Adam’s tragic failure. And by His death on the cross, He met the jus-
     tice of the law, which required the death of the sinner, thus gaining the
     right to redeem all who come to Him in true faith and surrender.
                                                                          67

     The Privileges of Adoption (Gal. 4:5–7)
        In Galatians 4:5–7, Paul expands on his theme, stressing that Christ
     has now “redeemed those who were under the law” (vss. 4, 5, ESV).
     The verb to redeem means “to buy back.” It referred to the price paid
     to buy the freedom of either a hostage or a slave. As this context indi-
     cates, redemption implies a negative background: a person is in need
     of being liberated.
        From what, though, do we need to be freed? The New Testament
     presents four things among others: (1) freed from the devil and his wiles
     (Heb. 2:14, 15), (2) freed from death (1 Cor. 15:56, 57), (3) freed from
     the power of sin that enslaves us by nature (Rom. 6:22), and (4) freed
     from the condemnation of the law (Rom. 3:19–24, Gal. 3:13, 4:5).

What positive purpose has Christ achieved for us through the
     redemption we have in Him? Gal. 4:5–7; Eph. 1:5; Rom. 8:15, 16,
     23; 9:4, 5.

        We often speak about what Christ has accomplished for us as “sal-
     vation.” Although true, this word is not nearly as vivid and descrip-
     tive as Paul’s unique use of the word adoption (huiothesia). Although
     Paul is the only New Testament author to use this word, adoption was
     a well-known legal procedure in the Greco-Roman world. Several
     Roman emperors during Paul’s life used adoption as the means of
     choosing a successor when they had no legal heir. Adoption guar-
     anteed a number of privileges: “(1) The adopted son become[s] the
     true son . . . of his adopter. . . . (2) The adopter agrees to bring up the
     child properly and to provide the necessities of food and clothing. (3)
     The adopter cannot repudiate his adopted son. (4) The child cannot
     be reduced to slavery. (5) The child’s natural parents have no right
     to reclaim him. (6) The adoption establishes the right to inherit.”
     —Derek R. Moore-Crispin, “Galatians 4:1–9: The Use and Abuse of
     Parallels,” The Evangelical Quarterly, vol. 61, no. 3 (1989), p. 216.
        If these rights are guaranteed on an earthly level, just imagine how
     much greater are the privileges we have as the adopted children of God!

      Read Galatians 4:6, realizing that the Hebrew word Abba was
      the intimate word children used to address their father, like
      the words Daddy or Papa today. Jesus used it in prayer (Mark
      14:36), and as God’s children we have the privilege of calling
      God “Abba,” as well. Do you enjoy that kind of intimate close-
      ness to God in your own life? If not, what’s the problem? What
      can you change to bring about this closeness?

     Why Turn Back to Slavery? (Gal. 4:8–20)

Read Galatians 4:8–20. On the lines below, summarize what Paul is
     saying here. How seriously does he take the false teachings among
     Galatians?
     ________________________________________________________
     ________________________________________________________
       Paul does not describe the exact nature of the Galatians’ religious
     practices, but he clearly has in mind a false system of worship that
     resulted in spiritual slavery. Indeed, he deemed it so dangerous and
     destructive that he had to write such an impassioned letter, warning
     the Galatians that what they were doing was akin to turning away
     from sonship to slavery.

Although he doesn’t get into specifics, what does Paul say is so
     objectionable about the behavior of the Galatians? Gal. 4:9–11.

     ________________________________________________________
     ________________________________________________________
        Many have interpreted Paul’s reference to “days and months and
     seasons and years” (Gal. 4:10, ESV) as an objection not merely to
     ceremonial laws but to the Sabbath, as well. Such an interpretation,
     however, goes beyond the evidence. For starters, if Paul really wanted
     to single out the Sabbath and other specific Jewish practices, it is clear
     from Colossians 2:16 that he easily could have identified them by
     name. Second, Paul makes it clear that whatever it is the Galatians are
     doing, it has led them from freedom in Christ to bondage. “If obser-
     vance of the seventh-day Sabbath subjects a man to bondage, it must
     be that the Creator Himself entered into bondage when He observed
     the world’s first Sabbath!”—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p.
     967. Also, why would Jesus not only have kept the Sabbath but taught
     others how to keep it, if its proper observance were in any way depriv-
     ing people of the freedom that they have in Him? (See Mark 2:27, 28;
     Luke 13:10–16.)

      Might there be any practices in Seventh-day Adventism that
      take away from the freedom that we have in Christ? Or, instead
      of the practices themselves being problematic, what about our
      attitudes toward the practices? How could a wrong attitude
      lead us into the kind of bondage that Paul warned the Galatians
      about so vehemently?
                                                                           69

    Further Study: “In the council of heaven, provision was made that men,
          though transgressors, should not perish in their disobedience, but,
          through faith in Christ as their substitute and surety, might become
          the elect of God predestinated unto the adoption of children by Jesus
          Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will. God wills
          that all men should be saved; for ample provision has been made, in
          giving his only-begotten Son to pay man’s ransom. Those who per-
          ish will perish because they refuse to be adopted as children of God
          through Christ Jesus. The pride of man hinders him from accepting
1
          the provisions of salvation. But human merit will not admit a soul
          into the presence of God. That which will make a man acceptable
          to God is the imparted grace of Christ through faith in his name. No
          dependence can be placed in works or in happy flights of feelings as
          evidence that men are chosen of God; for the elect are chosen through
          Christ.”—Ellen G. White, “Chosen in Christ,” Signs of the Times,

          January 2, 1893.

    Discussion Questions:
           l
           1 Dwell more on the idea of what it means, and what it does
           not mean, to be like children in our walk with the Lord. What
           aspects of children are we to emulate in regard to our faith and
           our relationship with God? At the same time, what are ways in
           which we can take this idea too far? Discuss.
3
           l
           2 What is it about human beings that makes us so afraid of the
           idea of grace, of salvation by faith alone? Why is it that many
           people would rather try to work their way to salvation, if that
           were possible?

           l
           3 As a class, go over the final question from Thursday’s lesson.
           In what ways can we as Seventh-day Adventists get caught up in
           the kind of slavery from which we have been ideally freed? How
           could this happen to us, how can we know if it does, and how can
           we be set free? 		

    Summary: In Christ we have been adopted into God’s family as His
          sons and daughters. As God’s children, we have access to all the
          rights and privileges that such a family relationship entails. To relate
          to God on the basis of rules and regulations alone would be foolish. It
          would be like a son wanting to renounce his position and inheritance
          in order to become a slave.

A New Calling
by Harshu Kamble
  I was a religious and political leader in my village in western India.
The people in the village looked up to me. I had a good-paying job selling
alcohol, and I tasted plenty of alcohol myself. But in spite of my standing
in the village, I felt spiritually unfulfilled.
  Then one day a Seventh-day Adventist pastor visited the village. I’d
never heard of Seventh-day Adventists before, but this pastor went from
home to home, sharing God’s love with us. I listened with interest as he
told me that Jesus Christ can give me deliverance from alcohol and fill
me with God’s peace.
  I was excited about this news and told others what this pastor was tell-
ing me. But some people didn’t like what he was saying to the villagers;
they turned against him and beat him. But three months later, the pastor
returned to the village and visited me. This time no one tried to stop him.
He held meetings, and about 50 people came to hear him speak of the
love of God.
  I was touched by what the pastor said, and I wondered how these people
could have beaten this man. I saw the Holy Spirit at work as some of the
very people who had beaten the pastor were now listening to him preach
God’s Word.
  I wanted to become a Christian and asked the man what I must do. He
told me to close my liquor business and accept Jesus as my Savior. I did
just that and asked for baptism. Within six months, 45 other people were
baptized, as well.
  We built a small village church, where I enjoyed worshiping and learn-
ing the Bible. Then a year later, the man who had led me to Christ called
me to serve God as a Global Mission pioneer. I accepted the challenge
with joy.
  So far I’ve worked in seven villages, all of which worship in the same
religion I once did. As of today, some 150 people have accepted the won-
derful message of God’s love and have been baptized. God is blessing me
wherever I go. The people listen to the message that God has asked me to
deliver, and I pray that they will give their hearts to God, even as I did.
  Your mission offerings help support these groups of new believers.
Thank you for making it possible to reach many people with God’s incred-
ible love.

      Paul’s Pastoral Appeal




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Gal. 4:12–20, 1 Cor. 11:1,
      Phil. 3:17, 1 Cor. 9:19–23, 2 Cor. 4:7–12.

Memory Text: “Friends, I beg you, become as I am, for I also have
      become as you are” (Galatians 4:12, NRSV).
        		


      A
               s we’ve seen so far, Paul did not mince words with the
               Galatians. His strong language, however, simply reflected the
               inspired passion he felt concerning the spiritual welfare of the
      church that he had founded. Besides the crucial theological issue with
      which Paul was dealing, the letter to the Galatians in a broad sense
      also shows just how important correct doctrine is. If what we believed
      were not that important, if doctrinal correctness did not matter all that
      much, then why would Paul have been so fervent, so uncompromis-
      ing, in his letter? The truth is, of course, that what we believe matters
      greatly, especially in the whole question of the gospel.
        In Galatians 4:12–20 Paul continues his discourse, although he
      changes his approach, at least a bit. Paul has made a number of
      detailed and theologically sophisticated arguments in his attempts
      to persuade the Galatians of their errors, and now he makes a more
      personal, pastoral appeal. Unlike the false teachers who had no true
      interest in the Galatians, Paul reveals the genuine concern, worry,
      hope, and love of a good shepherd for his wayward flock. He was not
      just correcting theology; he was seeking to minister to those whom
      he loved.

     The Heart of Paul
Read Galatians 4:12–20. What is the thrust of Paul’s message in
     these verses?

     ________________________________________________________

       The initial indication of the concern that weighs heavily on Paul’s
     heart is his personal appeal in verse 12. The appeal follows imme-
     diately after Paul’s insistence that the Galatians “become as I am.”
     The significance of the word entreat or beseech is, unfortunately, not
     fully conveyed in some translations. The word in Greek is deomai.
     Although it can be translated as “to urge” (NKJV) or “to entreat”
     (ESV), the Greek word has a stronger sense of desperation connected
     to it (see 2 Cor. 5:20, 8:4, 10:2). Paul is really saying, “I’m begging
     you!”
       Paul’s concern was not simply about theological ideas and doctrinal
     points of view. His heart was bound up with the lives of the people who
     were brought to Christ through his ministry. He considered himself more
     than just a friend; he was their spiritual father, and they were his chil-
     dren. But even more than that, Paul likens his concern for the Galatians
     to the worry and anguish that accompany a mother in childbirth (Gal.
     4:19). Paul had thought that his previous “labor” had been sufficient
     for their “safe delivery” when he founded the church. But now that the
     Galatians had wandered from the truth, Paul was experiencing those
     labor pains all over again in order to secure their well-being.

What goal did Paul have in mind for the Galatians? What result did
     he want to see from all his “labor” in their behalf? Gal. 4:19.

     ________________________________________________________

        Having first described the Galatians as being formed in the womb,
     Paul now speaks of the Galatians as if they were expectant mothers
     themselves. The word translated as “formed” was used medically to refer
     to the development of an embryo. Through this metaphor Paul describes
     what it means to be Christian, both individually and collectively as a
     church. To be a follower of Christ is more than just the profession of
     faith; it involves a radical transformation into the likeness of Christ. Paul
     was “not looking for a few minor alterations in the Galatians but for such
     a transformation that to see them would be to see Christ.”—Leon Morris,
     Galatians (Downers Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press, 1996), p. 142.

      In what ways have you seen the character of Christ manifested
      in your life? In what areas do you still have a lot of growing
      to do?

     The Challenge to Become
Read 1 Corinthians 11:1; Philippians 3:17; 2 Thessalonians 3:7–9;
     and Acts 26:28, 29. What is Paul saying here that is reflected in
     Galatians 4:12? How are we to understand his point?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Paul encourages Christians to imitate his behavior several times
     throughout his letters. In each situation, Paul presents himself as an
     authoritative example that believers should follow. In 2 Thessalonians
     3:7–9, Paul offers himself as an example of how the believers in
     Thessalonica should work to earn their own living and not be a burden
     on others. In 1 Corinthians 11:1, Paul calls upon the Corinthians to
     imitate him in placing the welfare of others first. Paul’s concern in
     Galatians appears to be somewhat different.
        In Galatians 4:12, Paul does not ask the Galatians to imitate him;
     instead, he asks that they “become as” he is—he is talking about being,
     not acting. Why? The trouble in Galatia was not unethical behavior
     or an ungodly lifestyle, as it was in the church in Corinth. The issue
     in Galatia was rooted in the essence of Christianity itself. It was more
     about “being” than “behavior.” Paul was not saying act like me, but be
     what I am. The exact terminology in Galatians 4:12 occurs in Paul’s
     appeal to Herod Agrippa II in Acts 26:29 (ESV) where Paul writes, “I
     would to God that not only you but also all who hear me this day might
     become such as I am—except for these chains” (emphasis supplied). In
     other words, Paul is referring to his experience as a Christian, a founda-
     tion that rests on Christ alone, a faith that trusts in what Christ has done
     for him and not in his works of the law. The Galatians were placing
     greater value on their behavior than on their identity in Christ.
        Although Paul does not specifically say how he wants the Galatians
     to become like him, the context of the situation in Galatians indicates
     it was not a blanket statement that covered every aspect and detail of
     his life. Because his concern was with the law-centered religion of the
     Galatians, Paul surely had in mind the wonderful love, joy, freedom,
     and certainty of salvation he had found in Jesus Christ. In light of the
     surpassing wonder of Christ, Paul had learned to count everything
     else as rubbish (Phil. 3:5–9)—and he longed for the Galatians them-
     selves to have that same experience.

      Is there someone you know (other than Jesus) who presents to
      you a good example? If so, what are the qualities of that person
      that you find so exemplary, and how can you better reveal those
      qualities in your life?

     I Have Become as You Are
Read 1 Corinthians 9:19–23. What does Paul say in these verses
     that can help us to understand better his point in the latter part
     of Galatians 4:12? See also Acts 17:16–34, 1 Cor. 8:8–13, Gal.
     2:11–14.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       Galatians 4:12 can seem a little confusing. Why should the Galatians
     become like Paul, if he had already become like them?
       As we saw in yesterday’s lesson, Paul wanted them to become like him
     in his complete faith and confidence in the all-sufficiency of Christ for
     salvation. His comment about having become like them was a reminder
     of how, although he was a Jew, he had become a Gentile “without the
     law” so that he might reach the Gentiles among them with the gospel. As
     the great missionary to the Gentile world, Paul had learned how to preach
     the gospel to both Jews and Gentiles. In fact, according to 1 Corinthians
     9:19–23, although the gospel remained the same, Paul’s method varied,
     depending on the people he was trying to reach.
       “Paul was a pioneer in what we call today contextualization, the
     need to communicate the gospel in such a way that it speaks to
     the total context of the people to whom it is addressed.”—Timothy
     George, The New American Commentary: Galatians (Nashville,
     Tenn.: Broadman & Holman Publishers, 1994), p. 321.
       Paul’s own comments in 1 Corinthians 9:21 indicate that he
     believed there were limits to how far someone should go in contex-
     tualizing the gospel. He mentions, for example, that while one is free
     to reach out in different ways to Jews and Gentiles, this freedom does
     not include the right to live a lawless lifestyle, for Christians are under
     the “law of Christ.”
       Although contextualization is not always easy, “insofar as we are
     able to separate the heart of the gospel from its cultural cocoon, to
     contextualize the message of Christ without compromising its con-
     tent, we too should become imitators of Paul.”—Timothy George,
     Galatians, pp. 321, 322.

      It’s so easy to compromise, isn’t it? Sometimes the longer one is
      a Christian, the easier compromise gets. Why might that be so?
      Look at yourself, honestly. How much compromise has crept into
      your life, and what have been the ways you have justified it? How
      can you turn this around in areas where you need to?
                                                                            75
          W ednesday November 23

      Then and Now
        Paul’s relationship with the Galatian believers was not always as
      difficult and frigid as it had now become. In fact, as Paul reflects on
      the time when he first preached the gospel in Galatia, he speaks in
      glowing terms of how well they treated him. What happened?

What event seems to have led to Paul’s decision to preach the gospel
      in Galatia? Gal. 4:13.
        		

        Apparently it had not been Paul’s original intention to preach the
      gospel in Galatia. Some sort of illness, however, overtook him on his
      journey, forcing him either to stay longer in Galatia than expected
      or to travel to Galatia for his recovery. Mystery surrounds the exact
      nature of Paul’s malady. Some have suggested that he contracted
      malaria; others (on the basis of Paul’s reference to the Galatians’ will-
      ingness to pluck out their eyes and give them to him) suggest that it
      was perhaps an eye disease. His illness may also have been connected
      to the “thorn in the flesh” he mentions in 2 Corinthians 12:7–9.
        Whatever Paul was suffering from, he does tell us it was so unpleas-
      ant that it became a trial to the Galatians. In a world where illness was
      often seen as a sign of divine displeasure (John 9:1, 2; Luke 13:1–4),
      Paul’s illness easily could have provided the Galatians with an excuse
      to reject both him and his message. But they welcomed Paul whole-
      heartedly. Why? Because their hearts had been warmed by the preach-
      ing of the Cross (Gal. 3:1) and the conviction of the Holy Spirit. What
      reason could they give now for their change of attitude?

What might have been God’s reasons for allowing Paul to suffer?
      How could Paul minister to others when he was struggling with
      his own problems? Rom. 8:28, 2 Cor. 4:7–12, 12:7–10.


        Whatever Paul’s illness was, it certainly was serious, and it easily
      could have provided him with an excuse either to blame God for his
      problems or to simply give up on preaching the gospel. Paul did nei-
      ther. Instead of letting his situation get the best of him, Paul used it
      as an opportunity to rely more fully on God’s grace. “Time and again
      God has used the adversities of life—sickness, persecution, poverty,
      even natural disasters and inexplicable tragedies—as occasions to
      display his mercy and grace and as a means to advance the gospel.”
      —Timothy George, Galatians, pp. 323, 324.

       How can you learn to let your trials and suffering make you
       lean more upon the Lord? (What other options do you have?)

     Speaking the Truth

Read Galatians 4:16. What powerful point is Paul making here? In
     what ways might you yourself have experienced something simi-
     lar? See also John 3:19; Matt. 26:64, 65; Jer. 36:17–23.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        The expression “speaking the truth” often has negative connotations,
     especially in our day and age, when it can be viewed as a hard-hitting,
     no-holds-barred, spare-no-enemies tactic of telling someone the facts,
     no matter how unpleasant or unwanted they may be. If it were not for
     Paul’s comments in Galatians 4:12–20 and a few other comments scat-
     tered throughout his letter (see Gal. 6:9, 10), one might mistakenly
     conclude that Paul’s interest in the truth of the gospel outweighed any
     expression of love. Yet, as we’ve seen, although Paul was concerned
     about the Galatians knowing the “truth of the gospel” (see Gal. 2:5,
     14), that concern arose because of his love for them. Who hasn’t experi-
     enced personally just how painful it can be to have to chastise someone,
     or in plain terms speak truths to them that—for whatever reason—they
     don’t want to hear? We do it because we care about the person, not
     because we want to cause hurt, although at times the immediate effect
     of our words is hurt, or even anger and resentment against us. We do it
     anyway, because we know it is what the person needs to hear, no matter
     how much he or she might not want to do so.

In Galatians 4:17–20, what is Paul saying about those whom he is
     opposing? What else is he challenging, besides their theology?

     ________________________________________________________

       In contrast to the candor of Paul’s gospel, by which he risked the
     possible ire of the Galatians, his opponents were actively courting
     the favor of the Galatians—not out of love for the Galatians but out
     of their own selfish motives. It is unclear exactly what Paul means
     when he says that his opponents “want to shut you out,” although this
     perhaps refers to an attempt to shut them out of the privileges of the
     gospel until they first submit to circumcision.

    Further Study: “In the Galatian churches, open, unmasked error was
         supplanting the gospel message. Christ, the true foundation of the
         faith, was virtually renounced for the obsolete ceremonies of Judaism.
         The apostle saw that if the believers in Galatia were saved from the
         dangerous influences which threatened them, the most decisive mea-
         sures must be taken, the sharpest warnings given.
            “An important lesson for every minister of Christ to learn is that of
         adapting his labors to the condition of those whom he seeks to benefit.
         Tenderness, patience, decision, and firmness are alike needful; but
         these are to be exercised with proper discrimination. To deal wisely
1
         with different classes of minds, under varied circumstances and con-
         ditions, is a work requiring wisdom and judgment enlightened and
         sanctified by the Spirit of God. . . .
            “Paul pleaded with those who had once known in their lives the
         power of God, to return to their first love of gospel truth. With unan-
         swerable arguments he set before them their privilege of becoming
2
         free men and women in Christ, through whose atoning grace all who
         make full surrender are clothed with the robe of His righteousness.
         He took the position that every soul who would be saved must have a
         genuine, personal experience in the things of God.
            “The apostle’s earnest words of entreaty were not fruitless. The
         Holy Spirit wrought with mighty power, and many whose feet had
         wandered into strange paths, returned to their former faith in the gos-
         pel. Henceforth they were steadfast in the liberty wherewith Christ
3
         had made them free.”—Ellen G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, pp.
         385, 386, 388.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Dwell more on the whole question of suffering and how God
          can use it. How do we deal with situations in which nothing good
          appears to have come from suffering?

          l
          2 Meditate on the idea of Christ being formed in us. What does
          this mean in practical terms? How can we know that this is hap-
          pening to us? How do we keep from being discouraged if it’s not
          happening as quickly as we think it should?

    Summary: Having made a number of detailed and theologically
         sophisticated arguments, Paul now makes a more personal and emo-
         tional appeal to the Galatians. He begs them to listen to his counsel,
         reminding them of the positive relationship they once shared and
         of the genuine love and concern he has for them as their spiritual
         parent.

Against the Tide
by Friday Nwamaga
   I grew up in a family that worshiped idols, but I often wondered about
my Christian friends’ beliefs. When a friend invited me to attend church
with him, I went. My parents were angry when they learned what I’d
done. But something had moved me during the worship service, and from
then on, I slept in the wild on Saturday night so I could attend church
on Sunday. I joined my friend’s church and became a youth leader.
Eventually, my mother and brother joined the church, too.
   James, a man who repaired my bicycle, gave me some books to read.
Two of the books, The Desire of Ages and The Great Controversy,
opened my mind to truth I hadn’t known before. He invited me to attend
a Revelation Seminar, so I went. I had studied Revelation before, but I
couldn’t understand it. During the seminar, this book became so clear to
me.
   I was so happy that I sang all the way home. My mother confronted
me. “Have you been attending the Seventh-day Adventist programs this
week?” she asked. I nodded, and tears clouded her eyes. “Why?” she
asked.
   “I’ve found truth I never knew before,” I told her. “And if you’re will-
ing, you can find it too.” She pleaded with me to stop attending the meet-
ings, but I told her that God had shown me the truth and I had to follow.
“I’ve decided to be a Seventh-day Adventist,” I said.
   I invited members of my former church to a week-long revival program
I was holding. Many came. I didn’t preach doctrine, but I told them what
Jesus was doing in my life and what He means to me. Near the end of the
meetings, I told the youth that I was leaving that church because I had
found greater truth. I invited them to follow me.
   And within a year, 20 people from my former church became Seventh-
day Adventists. Others accused the Seventh-day Adventists of snatching
me away. I explained to them that no one had forced me to leave their
church, and that Jesus had led me to greater truth in the Seventh-day
Adventist Church.
   God called me to the ministry, so I’m preparing for His service at
Babcock University. My church family helps as much as they can, and I
trust God for the rest.
   Your mission offerings and Thirteenth Sabbath Offerings have helped
build this fine Seventh-day Adventist school where young people in
Africa can prepare to serve the Lord and hasten His coming. Thank you.

      The Two Covenants




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Gal. 4:21–31; Gen. 1:28;
      2:2, 3; 3:15; 15:1–6; Exod. 6:2–8; 19:3–6.

Memory Text: “But the Jerusalem that is above is free, and she is
      our mother” (Galatians 4:26, NIV).



      C
              hristians who reject the authority of the Old Testament often
              see the giving of the law on Sinai as being inconsistent with
              the gospel. They conclude that the covenant given on Sinai
      represents an era, a dispensation, from a time in human history when
      salvation was based on obedience to the law. But because the people
      failed to live up to the demands of the law, God (they say) ushered in a
      new covenant, a covenant of grace through the merits of Jesus Christ.
      This, then, is their understanding of the two covenants: the old based
      on law, and the new based on grace.
        However common that view may be, it is wrong. Salvation was
      never by obedience to the law; biblical Judaism, from the start, was
      always a religion of grace. The legalism that Paul was confronting
      in Galatia was a perversion, not just of Christianity but of the Old
      Testament itself. The two covenants are not matters of time; instead,
      they are reflective of human attitudes. They represent two different
      ways of trying to relate to God, ways that go back to Cain and Abel.
      The old covenant represents those who, like Cain, mistakenly rely
      on their own obedience as a means of pleasing God; in contrast, the
      new covenant represents the experience of those who, like Abel, rely
      wholly upon God’s grace to do all that He has promised.

     Covenant Basics
        Many regard Paul’s interpretation of the history of Israel in Galatians
     4:21–31 as the most difficult passage in his letter. That’s because it
     is a highly complex argument that requires a broad knowledge of Old
     Testament persons and events. The first step in making sense of this
     passage is to have a basic understanding of an Old Testament concept
     central to Paul’s argument: the concept of the covenant.
        The Hebrew word translated “covenant” is berit. It occurs nearly
     three hundred times in the Old Testament and refers to a binding
     contract, agreement, or treaty. For thousands of years, covenants
     played an integral role in defining the relationships between people
     and nations across the ancient Near East. Covenants often involved
     the slaughter of animals as part of the process of making (literally
     “cutting”) a covenant. The killing of animals symbolized what would
     happen to a party that failed to keep its covenant promises and obli-
     gations.
        “From Adam to Jesus, God dealt with humanity by means of a
     series of covenant promises that centered on a coming Redeemer
     and which culminated in the Davidic covenant (Gen. 12:2, 3; 2 Sam.
     7:12–17; Isaiah 11). To Israel in Babylonian captivity, God promised
     a more effective ‘new covenant’ (Jer. 31:31–34) in connection with
     the coming of the Davidic Messiah (Ezek. 36:26–28; 37:22–28).”
     —Hans K. LaRondelle, Our Creator Redeemer (Berrien Springs,
     Mich.: Andrews University Press, 2005), p. 4.

What was the basis of God’s original covenant with Adam in the
     Garden of Eden before sin? Gen. 1:28; 2:2, 3, 15–17.

     ________________________________________________________

       While marriage, physical labor, and the Sabbath were part of the
     general provisions of the covenant of creation, its main focal point
     was God’s command not to eat the forbidden fruit. The basic nature of
     the covenant was “obey and live!” With a nature created in harmony
     with God, the Lord did not require the impossible. Obedience was
     humanity’s natural inclination; yet, Adam and Eve chose to do what
     was not natural, and, in that act, they not only ruptured the covenant of
     creation, they made its terms impossible for humans now corrupted by
     sin. God had to restore the relationship that Adam and Eve had lost.
     He did this by immediately enacting the covenant of grace based on
     the eternal promise of a Savior (Gen. 3:15).

      Read Genesis 3:15, the first gospel promise in the Bible. Where
      in that verse do you see an inkling of the hope that we have in
      Christ?
                                                                           81

      The Abrahamic Covenant
What covenant promises did God make to Abram in Genesis 12:1–5?
      What was Abram’s response?


         God’s initial promises to Abram make up one of the more powerful
      passages in the Old Testament. These verses all are about God’s grace. It
      is God, not Abram, who makes the promises. Abram had done nothing
      to earn or merit God’s favor; neither is there any indication that suggests
      that God and Abram had somehow worked together to come up with
      this agreement. God does all the promising. Abram, in contrast, is called
      to have faith in the surety of God’s promise, not some flimsy so-called
      “faith” but a faith that is manifested by his leaving his extended family (at
      the age of seventy-five!) and heading to the land God promised.
         “With the ‘blessing’ pronounced on Abraham and through him on
      all human beings, the Creator renewed His redemptive purpose. He
      had ‘blessed’ Adam and Eve in Paradise (Gen. 1:28, 5:2) and then
      ‘blessed Noah and his sons’ after the flood (9:1). This way God clari-
      fied His earlier promise of a Redeemer who will redeem humanity,
      destroy evil, and restore Paradise (Gen. 3:15). God confirmed His
      promise to bless ‘all peoples’ in His universal outreach.”—Hans K.
      LaRondelle, Our Creator Redeemer, pp. 22, 23.

After ten years of waiting for the promised son to be born, what ques-
      tions did Abram have regarding God’s promise? Gen. 15:1–6.


        It often is easy to glorify Abram as the man of faith who never had
      any questions or doubts. Scripture, however, paints a different picture.
      Abram believed, but he also had questions along the way. His faith was
      a growing faith. Like the father in Mark 9:24, Abram basically said to
      God in Genesis 15:8, “I believe, help my unbelief.” In response, God
      graciously assured Abram of the certainty of His promise by formally
      entering into a covenant with him (Gen. 15:7–18). What makes this
      passage so surprising is not the fact that God enters into a covenant with
      Abram but the extent to which God was willing to condescend to do
      so. Unlike other rulers in the ancient Near East who balked at the idea
      of making binding promises with their servants, God not only gave His
      word, but, by symbolically passing through the pieces of slaughtered
      animals, He staked His very life on it. Of course, Jesus ultimately gave
      His life on Calvary to make His promise a reality.

       What are some areas now where you have to reach out by faith
       and believe in what seems impossible? How can you learn to
       keep holding on, no matter what?

      Abraham, Sarah, and Hagar
Why does Paul have such a disparaging view of the incident with
      Hagar? Gal. 4:21–31, Genesis 16. What crucial point about salva-
      tion is Paul making through his use of this Old Testament story?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Hagar’s place in the Genesis story is directly related to Abram’s fail-
      ure to believe God’s promise. As an Egyptian slave in Abram’s house-
      hold, Hagar likely came into Abram’s possession as one of the many
      gifts Pharaoh gave to him in exchange for Sarai, an event associated
      with Abram’s first act of unbelief in God’s promise (Gen. 12:11–16).
        After waiting ten years for the promised child to be born, Abram
      and Sarai remained childless. Concluding that God needed their
      help, Sarai gave Hagar to Abram as a concubine. Although strange
      to us today, Sarai’s plan was quite ingenious. According to ancient
      customs, a female slave legally could serve as a surrogate mother for
      her barren mistress. Thus Sarai could count any child born from her
      husband and Hagar as her own. While the plan did produce a child, it
      was not the child God had promised.
        In this story we have a powerful example of how, when faced with
      daunting circumstances even a great man of God had a lapse of faith.
      In Genesis 17:18, 19, Abraham pleaded with God to accept Ishmael
      as his heir; the Lord, of course, rejected that offer. The only “miracu-
      lous” element in the birth of Ishmael was Sarah’s willingness to share
      her husband with another woman! There was nothing out of the ordi-
      nary about the birth of a child to this woman, a child born “according
      to the flesh.” Had Abraham trusted in what God had promised him
      instead of letting the circumstances overcome that trust, none of this
      would have happened, and a lot of grief would have been avoided.

In contrast to the birth of Ishmael, look at the circumstances surrounding
      Isaac’s birth. Gen. 17:15–19; 18:10–13; Heb. 11:11, 12. Why did these
      circumstances require so much faith of Abraham and Sarah?

      Hagar and Mount Sinai (Gal. 4:21–31)
What type of covenant relationship did God want to establish with
      His people at Sinai? What similarities does it share with God’s
      promise to Abraham? Exod. 6:2–8, 19:3–6, Deut. 32:10–12.

      ________________________________________________________

         God desired to share the same covenant relationship with the chil-
      dren of Israel at Sinai that He shared with Abraham. In fact, similari-
      ties exist between God’s words to Abraham in Genesis 12:1–3 and
      His words to Moses in Exodus 19. In both cases, God emphasizes
      what He will do for His people. He does not ask the Israelites to prom-
      ise to do anything to earn His blessings; instead, they are to obey as a
      response to those blessings. The Hebrew word translated as “to obey”
      in Exodus 19:5 literally means “to hear.” God’s words do not imply
      righteousness by works. On the contrary, He wanted Israel to have the
      same faith that characterized Abraham’s response to His promises (at
      least most of the time!).

If the covenant relationship God offered to Israel on Sinai is similar to
      the one given to Abraham, why does Paul identify Mount Sinai
      with the negative experience of Hagar? Exod. 19:7–25; Heb. 8:6, 7.
        			
      ________________________________________________________

         The covenant at Sinai was intended to point out the sinfulness of
      humanity and the remedy of God’s abundant grace, which were typified
      in the sanctuary services. The problem with the Sinai covenant was not
      on God’s part but rather with the faulty promises of the people (Heb.
      8:6). Instead of responding to God’s promises in humility and faith, the
      Israelites responded with self-confidence. “ ‘All that the Lord hath spo-
      ken we will do’ ” (Exod. 19:8). After living as slaves in Egypt for more
      than four hundred years, they had no true concept of God’s majesty nor
      the extent of their own sinfulness. In the same way that Abraham and
      Sarah tried to help God fulfill His promises, the Israelites sought to turn
      God’s covenant of grace into a covenant of works. Hagar symbolizes
      Sinai in that both reveal human attempts at salvation by works.
         Paul is not claiming that the law given at Sinai was evil or abolished.
      He is concerned with the Galatians’ legalistic misapprehension of the
      law. “Instead of serving to convict them of the absolute impossibility
      of pleasing God by law-keeping, the law fostered in them a deeply
      entrenched determination to depend on personal resources in order to
      please God. Thus the law did not serve the purposes of grace in lead-
      ing the Judaizers to Christ. Instead, it closed them off from Christ.”

      N.J.: Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Co., 1980), p. 181.

     Ishmael and Isaac Today
        Paul’s brief sketch of Israel’s history was designed to counter
     the arguments made by his opponents who claimed that they were
     the true descendants of Abraham and that Jerusalem—the center of
     Jewish Christianity and the law—was their mother. The Gentiles, they
     charged, were illegitimate; if they wanted to become true followers
     of Christ, they must first become a son of Abraham by submitting to
     the law of circumcision.
        The truth, Paul says, is the opposite. These legalists are not the sons
     of Abraham but are illegitimate sons, like Ishmael. By placing their
     trust in circumcision, they were relying on “the flesh,” as Sarah did
     with Hagar and as the Israelites did with God’s law at Sinai. Gentile
     believers, however, were the sons of Abraham not by natural descent
     but, like Isaac, by the supernatural. “Like Isaac they were a fulfil-
     ment of the promise made to Abraham . . . ; like Isaac, their birth into
     freedom was the effect of divine grace; like Isaac, they belong to the
     column of the covenant of promise.”—James D. G. Dunn, The Epistle
     to the Galatians (London: Hendrickson Publishers, 1993), p. 256.

What will the true descendants of Abraham face in this world?
     Gal. 4:28–31, Gen. 21:8–12.
     ________________________________________________________
     ________________________________________________________

        Being the promised child brought Isaac not only blessings but also
     opposition and persecution. In reference to persecution, Paul has in
     mind the ceremony in Genesis 21:8–10, where Isaac is being honored
     and Ishmael appears to make fun of him. The Hebrew word in Genesis
     21:9 literally means “to laugh,” but Sarah’s reaction suggests Ishmael
     was mocking or ridiculing Isaac. While Ishmael’s behavior might not
     sound very significant to us today, it revealed the deeper hostilities
     involved in a situation when the family birthright was at stake. Many
     rulers in antiquity tried to secure their position by eliminating poten-
     tial rivals, including siblings (Judg. 9:1–6). Although Isaac faced
     opposition, he also enjoyed all the privileges of love, protection, and
     favor that went along with being his father’s heir.
        As spiritual descendants of Isaac, we should not be surprised when
     we suffer hardship and opposition, even from within the church fam-
     ily itself.

      In what ways have you suffered persecution, especially from
      those closest to you, because of your faith? Or ask yourself this
      hard question: might you be guilty of persecuting others for
      their faith? Think about it.
                                                                           85

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Law and the Covenants,”
         pp. 363–373, in Patriarchs and Prophets.

            “But if the Abrahamic covenant contained the promise of redemp-
         tion, why was another covenant formed at Sinai? In their bondage
         the people had to a great extent lost the knowledge of God and of the
         principles of the Abrahamic covenant. . . .
1
            “God brought them to Sinai; He manifested His glory; He gave
         them His law, with the promise of great blessings on condition of
         obedience: ‘If ye will obey My voice indeed, and keep My covenant,
         then . . . ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.’
         Exodus 19:5, 6. The people did not realize the sinfulness of their own
         hearts, and that without Christ it was impossible for them to keep
2
         God’s law; and they readily entered into covenant with God. . . . Yet
         only a few weeks passed before they broke their covenant with God,
         and bowed down to worship a graven image. They could not hope for
         the favor of God through a covenant which they had broken; and now,
         seeing their sinfulness and their need of pardon, they were brought
         to feel their need of the Saviour revealed in the Abrahamic covenant
         and shadowed forth in the sacrificial offerings. Now by faith and
         love they were bound to God as their deliverer from the bondage of
3
         sin. Now they were prepared to appreciate the blessings of the new
         covenant.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 371, 372.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Is your own walk with the Lord more of an “old covenant” or
          a “new covenant” type? How can you tell the difference?

          l
          2 What are some of the issues in your local church that are
          causing tension within the body? How are they being resolved?
          Although you might find yourself being the victim of “persecu-
          tion,” how can you make sure, too, that you aren’t the one doing
          the persecuting? Where’s the fine line there? See also Matt.
          18:15–17.

          l3 How many times have you made promises to the Lord that
          you would not do this or that, only to do this or that? How does
          this sad fact help you understand the meaning of grace?		
          					

    Summary: The stories of Hagar, Ishmael, and the children of Israel
         at Sinai illustrate the foolishness of trying to rely upon our own
         efforts to accomplish what God has promised. This method of self-
         righteousness is referred to as the old covenant. The new covenant is
         the everlasting covenant of grace first established with Adam and Eve
         after sin, renewed with Abraham, and ultimately fulfilled in Christ.

For God Alone
   Jordy is 12 years old and lives in Ecuador. Although his family has suffered
much, he feels that he is blessed, for his parents have shown him how to live
for God alone.
   His mother has a painful disease that has left her unable to walk. In spite of
her pain, her love for Jesus shines through everything she does. And last year
his father lost his job, so the family had no income. But they don’t blame God
for their problems. Instead, they praise Him for providing for their needs.
   Jordy’s parents sold their house and moved into a one-room apartment in
order to pay for his mother’s medical treatments. But Jordy doesn’t mind.
“My mother is more important than any house!” he says. “When we can’t
see how we’ll manage, we remind ourselves that God provides for the spar-
rows. Surely, He will provide for us too. I give my worries to God and let
Him handle things. Sometimes we’ve had no food in our house, and when we
prayed someone brought us food. I know that God won’t forget us.”
   But Jordy doesn’t like to dwell on his family problems. He wants to talk
about how God has blessed him and his family. Jordy used to be shy. Then
someone invited him to preach in church. He wasn’t sure he could do it, but
he agreed to try. “I prayed a lot, and I realized that God can use me to reach
people’s hearts. It changed my life!” he says.
   Now Jordy preaches often. He loves to tell others what God can do in their
lives. He shares his faith with his neighbors and with his classmates at school
too. “I want everyone to know that God loves them and has a plan for their
lives,” he says.
   When Jordy’s uncle was married, he invited Jordy to preach the sermon
for the wedding. Jordy agreed, but he was shocked to find 800 people at the
wedding. He prayed for God’s blessing, and he felt God speaking through
him. “Afterward when people thanked me for my sermon, I told them it
                                wasn’t from me; it was from God,” Jordy said.
                                “I don’t want credit for what God does. It’s for
                                God’s glory.”
                                   Jordy wants everyone to know Jesus and love
                                God as he does. “I tell them that they are God’s
                                children; they just didn’t know it until someone
                                told them.” Jordy has dedicated his life to God
                                alone, and he invites everyone to do the same.
                                We can share God’s love with others we meet
                                and through our mission offerings. Thanks for
                                living as Jordy does, for God alone.

      Freedom in Christ
        							




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Gal. 5:1–15; 1 Cor. 6:20;
      Rom. 8:1; Heb. 2:14, 15; Rom. 8:4; 13:8.

Memory Text: “For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only
      do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but
      through love serve one another” (Galatians 5:13, ESV).



      I
          n Galatians 2:4, Paul briefly referred to the importance of protect-
          ing the “freedom” that we have in Christ Jesus. But what does
          Paul mean when he speaks about “freedom,” which he so often
      does? What does this freedom include? How far does this freedom
      go? Does it have any limits? And what connection does freedom in
      Christ have to the law?
         Paul addresses these questions by warning the Galatians of two
      dangers. The first is legalism. Paul’s opponents in Galatia were so
      caught up trying to earn God’s favor through their behavior that they
      lost sight of the liberating nature of Christ’s work, of the salvation
      that they already had in Christ through faith. The second threat is the
      tendency to abuse the freedom Christ has obtained for us by lapsing
      into licentiousness. Those who hold this view mistakenly assume that
      freedom is antithetical to the law.
         Both legalism and licentiousness are opposed to freedom, because
      they equally keep their adherents in a form of slavery. Paul’s appeal
      to the Galatians, however, is to stand firm in the true freedom that is
      their rightful possession in Christ.

     Christ Has Set Us Free
       “Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made
     us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage”
     (Gal. 5:1).

        Like the rallying command of a military leader to his wavering
     troops, Paul charges the Galatians not to surrender their freedom in
     Christ. The forcefulness and intensity of Paul’s tone cause his words
     nearly to leap off the page into action. In fact, this seems to be exactly
     what Paul intended. Although this verse is connected thematically to
     what precedes and what follows, its abruptness and lack of syntacti-
     cal connections in Greek suggest that Paul wanted this verse to stand
     out like a gigantic billboard. Freedom in Christ sums up Paul’s entire
     argument, and the Galatians were in danger of giving it away.

Read Galatians 1:3, 4; 2:16; and 3:13. What are some of the meta-
     phors used in these verses, and how do they help us understand
     what Christ has done for us?

        Paul’s words, “for freedom Christ has set us free” (Gal. 5: 1, ESV),
     may suggest that he has another metaphor in mind here. The word-
     ing of this phrase is similar to the formula used in the sacred freeing
     (manumission) of slaves. Because slaves had no legal rights, it was
     supposed that a deity could purchase their freedom, and in return, the
     slave, though really free, would legally belong to the god. Of course,
     in actual practice the process was fiction; it was the slave who paid
     the money into the temple treasury for his or her freedom. Consider,
     for example, the formula used in one of the nearly one thousand
     inscriptions found at the temple to Pythian Apollo at Delphi that date
     from 201 b.c. to a.d. 100: “ ‘For Freedom, Apollo the Pythian bought
     from Sosibus of Amphissa a female slave whose name is Nicaea. . . .
     The purchase, however, Nicaea has committed unto Apollo for free-
     dom.’ ”—Ben Witherington III, Grace in Galatia (Grand Rapids,
     Mich.: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1998), p. 340.
        This formula shares a basic similarity with Paul’s terminology, but
     there is a fundamental difference. In Paul’s metaphor, no fiction is
     involved. We did not provide the purchase price ourselves (1 Cor.
     6:20, 7:23). The price was far too high for us. We were powerless to
     save ourselves, but Jesus stepped in and did for us what we could not
     do (at least not without forfeiting our lives). He paid the penalty for
     our sins, thus freeing us from condemnation.

      Look at your own life. Do you ever think that you could save
      yourself? What should your answer tell you about how grateful
      you need to be for what we have been given in Jesus?
                                                                           89

      The Nature of Christian Freedom
         Paul’s command to stand firm in freedom is not made in isolation.
      An important statement of fact precedes it: “Christ has set us free.”
      Why should Christians stand firmly in their freedom? Because Christ
      has already set them free. In other words, our freedom is a result of
      what Christ has already done for us.
         This pattern of a statement of fact followed by an exhortation is typi-
      cal in Paul’s letters (1 Cor. 6:20; 10:13, 14; Col. 2:6). For example,
      Paul makes several indicative statements in Romans 6 about the facts
      of our condition in Christ, such as, “We know that our old self was
      crucified with him” (Rom. 6:6, ESV). On the basis of this fact, Paul
      can then issue the imperative exhortation, “Therefore, do not let sin
      exercise dominion in your mortal bodies” (Rom. 6:12, NRSV). This
      is Paul’s way of saying essentially, “Become what you already are
      in Christ.” The ethical life of the gospel does not present the burden
      of trying to do things in order to prove that we are God’s children.
      Rather, we do what we do because we already are His children.

From what has Christ freed us? Rom. 6:14, 18; 8:1; Gal. 4:3, 8; 5:1;
      Heb. 2:14, 15.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         The use of the word freedom to describe the Christian life is more
      prominent in Paul’s letters than anywhere else in the New Testament.
      The word freedom and its cognates occur 28 times in Paul’s letters, in
      contrast to only 13 times elsewhere.
         What does Paul mean by freedom? First, it is not a mere abstract
      concept. It does not refer to political freedom, economic freedom, or
      the freedom to live any way we might please. On the contrary, it is a
      freedom that is grounded in our relationship to Jesus Christ. The context
      suggests that Paul is referring to freedom from the bondage and con-
      demnation of a law-driven Christianity, but our freedom includes much
      more. It includes freedom from sin, eternal death, and the devil.
         “Outside of Jesus Christ, human existence is characterized as
      bondage—bondage to the law, bondage to the evil elements dominating
      the world, bondage to sin, the flesh, and the devil. God sent his Son into
      the world to shatter the dominion of these slave-holders.”—Timothy
      George, Galatians, p. 354.

       To what things do you feel enslaved in life? Memorize Galatians
       5:1 and ask God to make the freedom you have in Christ a real-
       ity in your life.

     The Dangerous Consequences
     of Legalism (Gal. 5:2–12)
        The way in which Paul introduces Galatians 5:2–12 indicates the
     importance of what he is about to say. “Look” (ESV), “Listen!”
     (NRSV), “Mark my words!” (NIV), “I, Paul, say to you” (ESV). Paul
     is not fooling around. By his forceful use of the word look, he not only
     calls for his readers’ full attention, but he even evokes his apostolic
     authority. He wants them to understand that if the Gentiles are going
     to submit to circumcision to be saved, then the Galatians need to real-
     ize the dangerous consequences involved in their decision.

Read Galatians 5:2–12. What does Paul warn about in regard to the
     whole question of circumcision?

     ________________________________________________________

        The first consequence of trying to earn God’s favor by submit-
     ting to circumcision is that it obligates the person to keep the entire
     law. Paul’s language in verses 2 and 3 includes an interesting play
     on words. Christ, he says, will not benefit them (ophelesei); rather,
     they will be obligated (opheiletes) to the law. If a person wants to
     live according to the law, he or she cannot just pick and choose the
     precepts to follow. It is all or nothing.
        Second, they will be “cut off” from Christ. A decision to be justi-
     fied by works involves at the same time a rejection of God’s way of
     justification in Christ. “You cannot have it both ways. It is impossible
     to receive Christ, thereby acknowledging that you cannot save your-
     self, and then receive circumcision, thereby claiming that you can.”
     —John R. W. Stott, The Message of Galatians (Leicester, England:
     InterVarsity Press, 1968), p. 133.
        Paul’s third objection to circumcision is that it hinders spiritual
     growth. His analogy is of a runner whose progress toward the finish line
     has been deliberately sabotaged. In fact, the word translated “hindered”
     (vs. 7, ESV) was used in military circles to refer “to breaking up a road
     or destroying a bridge or placing obstacles in the way of an enemy, to
     halt his advance.”—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 978.
        Finally, circumcision removes the offense of the Cross. How? The
     message of circumcision implies that you can save yourself; as such,
     it is flattering to human pride. The message of the Cross, however, is
     offensive to human pride, because we have to acknowledge that we
     are dependent completely on Christ.
        Paul is so outraged at these people for their insistence on circum-
     cision that he says that he wishes that the knife would slip and they
     would castrate themselves! Strong words, but Paul’s tone simply
     reflects how seriously he views this issue.
                                                                          91

      Liberty Not Licentiousness (Gal. 5:13)
        Galatians 5:13 marks an important turning point in the book of
      Galatians. Whereas up to this point Paul has focused entirely on the
      theological content of his message, he now turns to the issue of Christian
      behavior. How should a person who is not saved by works of law live?

What potential misuse of freedom did Paul want to keep the Galatians
      from committing? Gal. 5:13.

      ________________________________________________________

         Paul was well aware of the potential misunderstanding that accom-
      panied his emphasis on the grace and the freedom that believers have
      in Christ (Rom. 3:8; 6:1, 2). The problem, however, was not Paul’s
      gospel but the human tendency for self-indulgence. The pages of his-
      tory are littered with the stories of people, cities, and nations whose
      corruption and descent into moral chaos were directly related to their
      lack of self-control. Who hasn’t felt this tendency in his or her own
      life, as well? That’s why Paul so clearly calls followers of Jesus to
      avoid indulging in the flesh. In fact, he wants them to do the opposite,
      which is “through love serve one another” (NKJV). As anyone who
      serves others out of love knows, this is something that can be done
      only through death to self, death to the flesh. Those who indulge their
      own flesh are not the ones who tend to serve others. On the contrary.
         Thus, our freedom in Christ is not merely a freedom from the enslave-
      ment to the world but a call to a new type of service, the responsibility
      to serve others out of love. It is “the opportunity to love the neighbor
      without hindrance, the possibility of creating human communities
      based on mutual self-giving rather than the quest for power and
      status.”—Sam K. Williams, Galatians (Nashville, Tenn.: Abingdon
      Press, 1997), p. 145.
         Because of our familiarity with Christianity and the wording of mod-
      ern translations of Galatians 5:13, it is easy to overlook the startling
      power these words would have conveyed to the Galatians. First, the
      Greek language indicates that the love that motivates this type of ser-
      vice is not ordinary human love—that would be impossible; human
      love is far too conditional. Paul’s use of the article (the) before the
      word love in Greek indicates he is referring to “the” divine love that
      we receive only through the Spirit (Rom. 5:5). The real surprise lies
      in the fact that the word translated as “serve” is the Greek word for
      “to be enslaved.” Our freedom is not for self-autonomy but for mutual
      enslavement to one another based on God’s love.

       Be honest: have you ever thought you could use the freedom
       you have in Christ to indulge in a little bit of sin here and there?
       What’s so detrimental about that kind of thinking?

      Fulfilling the Whole Law (Gal. 5:13–15)
How do you reconcile Paul’s negative comments about “do[ing] the
      whole law” (Gal. 5:3) with his positive statement about “fulfill[ing]
      all the law” (Gal. 5:14)? Compare Rom. 10:5; Gal. 3:10, 12; 5:3
      with Rom. 8:4; 13:8; Gal. 5:14.

      ________________________________________________________

         Many have seen the contrast between Paul’s negative comments
      about “doing the whole law” and his positive assertions about “fulfill-
      ing the whole law” as paradoxical. They really aren’t. The solution lies
      in the fact that Paul intentionally uses each phrase to make an important
      distinction between two different ways of defining Christian behavior
      in relation to the law. For example, it is significant that when Paul refers
      positively to Christian observance of the law, he never describes it as
      “doing the law.” He reserves that phrase to refer solely to the misguided
      behavior of those who are living under the law and are trying to earn
      God’s approval by “doing” what the law commands.
         This is not to imply that those who have found salvation in Christ
      do not obey. Nothing could be further from the truth. Paul says they
      “fulfill” the law. He means that true Christian behavior is much more
      than the outward obedience of just “doing” the law; it “fulfills” the
      law. Paul uses the word fulfill because it goes far beyond just “doing.”
      This type of obedience is rooted in Jesus (see Matt. 5:17). It is not an
      abandonment of the law, nor a reduction of the law only to love, but
      it is the way through which the believer can experience the true intent
      and meaning of the whole law!

Where, according to Paul, is the full meaning of the law found? Lev.
      19:18; Mark 12:31, 33; Matt. 19:19; Rom. 13:9; James 2:8.

      ________________________________________________________

         Although it is a quotation from Leviticus, Paul’s statement in
      Galatians is ultimately rooted in Jesus’ use of Leviticus 19:18. Jesus,
      however, was not the only Jewish teacher to refer to Leviticus 19:18
      as a summary of the whole law. Rabbi Hillel, who lived about a gen-
      eration before Jesus, said, “What is hateful to you, do not do to your
      neighbor; that is the whole law.” But Jesus’ perspective radically was
      different (Matt. 7:12). Not only is it more positive, but it also demon-
      strates that law and love are not incompatible. Without love, the law
      is empty and cold; without law, love has no direction.

       What’s easier, and why: to love others or simply to obey the
       Ten Commandments? Bring your answer to class.
                                                                              93

    Further Study: “Genuine faith always works by love. When you look
         to Calvary it is not to quiet your soul in the nonperformance of duty,
         not to compose yourself to sleep, but to create faith in Jesus, faith that
         will work, purifying the soul from the slime of selfishness. When we
         lay hold of Christ by faith, our work has just begun. Every man has
         corrupt and sinful habits that must be overcome by vigorous warfare.
         Every soul is required to fight the fight of faith. If one is a follower of
         Christ, he cannot be sharp in deal, he cannot be hardhearted, devoid
1
         of sympathy. He cannot be coarse in his speech. He cannot be full of
         pomposity and self-esteem. He cannot be overbearing, nor can he use
         harsh words, and censure and condemn.
            “The labor of love springs from the work of faith. Bible religion
         means constant work. ‘Let your light so shine before men, that they
         may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.’
2
         ‘Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God
         that worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good pleasure.’ We
         are to be zealous of good works; be careful to maintain good works.
         And the true Witness says, ‘I know thy works.’
            “While it is true that our busy activities will not in themselves
         ensure salvation, it is also true that faith which unites us to Christ will
         stir the soul to activity (MS 16, 1890).”—Ellen G. White Comments,
         The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1111.

    Discussion Questions:

          1 As a class, go over your answers to the last question from
          Thursday’s lesson. Which option did most people find easier,
          and why? What important truths does your answer suggest to
          you about what it means to fulfill the law?

          l
          2 Paul says that faith “works” through love. What does he
          mean?					

          l
          3 Examine the idea of seeking to use your freedom in Christ to
          indulge in sin. Why is that so easy to do? When people think that
          way, what trap are they falling into? See 1 John 3:8.

    Summary: Freedom is one of Paul’s favorite words for defining the
         gospel. It includes both what Christ has done for us in freeing us from
         bondage to the world and also how we are called to live the Christian
         life. We need to be careful, however, that our liberty does not fall
         prey either to legalism or licentiousness. Christ did not set us free so
         that we could serve ourselves but so that we might give our lives in
         ministry to our neighbors.

God’s Thousand Ways
by Prescilla Canilang
   I live in Sydney, Australia. Like most Australians, I had read the Bible
some, but I wasn’t terribly interested in God. However, when I received
a brochure advertising a prophecy seminar, it caught my interest and I
decided to attend. I learned so much about Daniel and Revelation—two
books that had always puzzled me.
   I learned about the Discover Bible studies, which are offered on the
Internet. I logged on and began studying the Bible online. I was pleased to
see that everything the course discussed was backed up by the Bible. And
it was so convenient! I could study on my own schedule.
   After the prophecy seminar ended, I continued studying the Bible
online. I finished four different courses in one year. They were so interest-
ing that I could hardly wait to study the next lesson. The lessons covered
things that I had learned in the prophecy seminar, plus new information
that filled in the gaps in my knowledge. A health course even helped me
learn how to take better care of myself and to be more careful about what
I ate, how I exercised, and even how much I rested.
   I realized that my religious background was based more on tradition
than on God’s Word, but the Seventh-day Adventists really did know a lot
about their Bible. I gave my life totally to Christ and felt his blessing and
love. I knew that I had been freed from false beliefs and bad habits.
   The church where I had attended the prophecy seminar was far from
my home. Then I learned of a church closer to my home, and I worshiped
there. I was baptized into the Seventh-day Adventist family a few months
later.
   I thank God for all the ministries that helped lead me to Him. The
prophecy seminar sparked my interest, and the Discover Bible lessons on
the Internet were there when I needed them with high quality Bible study
guides. Looking back I know that the Holy Spirit was leading me step by
step. I feel so loved!
   Now I’m sharing my faith with people at work, with friends, and even
with people God puts in my path. It’s not easy in such a secular culture,
but I pray that people will see Jesus in me and will accept God’s love in
their own life.
   God has a thousand ways to lead people to Himself. Thank you for
giving your mission offerings, which help make it possible for people
anywhere in the world to find Christ through personal evangelism or the
Internet.

      Living by the Spirit




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Gal. 5:16–25; Deut. 13:
      4, 5; Rom. 7:14–24; Jer. 7:9; Hos. 4:2; Matt. 22:35–40.

Memory Text: “But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not
      gratify the desires of the flesh” (Galatians 5:16, ESV).



      O
               ne of the most beloved Christian hymns is Robert Robinson’s
               “Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing.” Robinson, however,
               was not always a man of faith. The death of his father left him
      angry, and he fell into debauchery and drunkenness. After hearing the
      famous preacher George Whitefield, Robinson surrendered his life
      to the Lord, became a Methodist pastor, and wrote that hymn, which
      originally included the lines: “Oh, to grace how great a debtor / Daily
      I’m constrained to be! / Let Thy goodness, like a fetter, / Bind me
      closer still to Thee.”
         Uncomfortable with the line about the Christian heart’s wandering,
      someone changed the words to read: “Prone to worship, Lord, I feel
      it, / Prone to love the God I serve.”
         Despite the editor’s good intentions, the original words accurately
      describe the Christian struggle. As believers we possess two natures,
      the flesh and the Spirit, and they are in conflict. Although our sinful
      nature will always be “prone” to wander from God, if we are willing
      to surrender to His Spirit, we do not have to be enslaved to the desires
      of the flesh. This is the thrust of Paul’s message in the texts for the
      week.

     Walking in the Spirit
Read Galatians 5:16. What does the concept of “walking” have to do
     with a life of faith? Deut. 13:4, 5; Rom. 13:13; Eph. 4:1, 17; Col.
     1:10.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        “Walking” is a metaphor drawn from the Old Testament that refers
     to the way a person should behave. Paul, himself a Jew, makes use
     of this metaphor often in his letters to describe the type of conduct
     that should characterize the Christian life. His use of this metaphor
     is also likely connected to the first name that was associated with the
     early church. Before the followers of Jesus were called Christians
     (Acts 11:26), they were known simply as followers of “the Way”
     (John 14:6, Acts 22:4, 24:14). This suggests that, at a very early date,
     Christianity was not merely a set of theological beliefs that centered
     on Jesus but was also a “way” of life to be “walked.”

In what way is Paul’s metaphor about walking different from that
     found in the Old Testament? Compare Exod. 16:4; Lev. 18:4; Jer.
     44:23 with Gal. 5:16, 25; Rom. 8:4.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Conduct in the Old Testament simply was not defined as “walking”
     but more particularly as “walking in the law.” Halakhah is the legal
     term Jews use to refer to the rules and regulations found in both the law
     and the rabbinic traditions of their forefathers. While Halakhah usually
     is translated “the Jewish law,” the word actually is based on the Hebrew
     word for “to walk” and literally means “the way of going.”
        Paul’s comments about “walking in the Spirit” are not contrary to
     obedience to the law. He is not proposing that Christians should live
     in a way that violates the law. Again, Paul is not opposed to the law
     or to obedience to the law. What he is opposed to is the legalistic way
     in which the law was being misused. The genuine obedience that God
     desires never can be achieved by outward compulsion but only by an
     inward motivation produced by the Spirit (Gal. 5:18).

      What has been your own experience of “walking in the Spirit”?
      How do you do that? What practices in your life make this kind
      of walk more difficult?
                                                                          97

     The Christian’s Conflict
       		
       “For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against
     the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye
     cannot do the things that ye would” (Gal. 5:17; see also Rom. 7:
     14–24). How have you, in your own life as a believer, experienced
     the harsh and painful reality of these words?
     ________________________________________________________
     ________________________________________________________
     ________________________________________________________

        The struggle that Paul describes is not the struggle of every human
     being; it refers specifically to the inward tug-of-war that exists in the
     Christian. Because humans are born in harmony with the desires of
     the flesh (Rom. 8:7), it is only when we are born anew by the Spirit
     that a real spiritual conflict begins to emerge (John 3:6). This does
     not mean that non-Christians never experience moral conflict; they
     certainly do. But even that conflict is ultimately a result of the Spirit.
     The struggle of the Christian, however, takes on a new dimension,
     because the believer possesses two natures that are at war with each
     other, the flesh and the Spirit.
        Throughout history, Christians have longed for relief from this
     struggle. Some have sought to end the conflict by withdrawing from
     society, while others have claimed that the sinful nature can be
     eradicated by some divine act of grace. Both attempts are misguided.
     Although by the Spirit’s power we certainly can subdue the desires of
     the flesh, the conflict will continue in various ways until we receive a
     new body at the Second Coming. Fleeing from society does not help,
     because no matter where we go, we take the struggle with us, and we
     will until death or the Second Coming.
        When Paul writes in Romans 7 about the inward conflict in
     Christians preventing them from doing what they want, he is under-
     scoring the full extent of that conflict. Because we possess two natures,
     we are literally on both sides of the battle at once. The spiritual part
     of us desires what is spiritual and detests the flesh. The fleshly part
     of us, however, longs for the things of the flesh and opposes what is
     spiritual. Because the converted mind is too weak to resist the flesh
     by itself, the only hope we have of subduing the flesh is by making a
     daily decision to side with the Spirit against our sinful selves. This is
     why Paul is so insistent that we choose to walk in the Spirit.

      From your own experience of the battle between these two
      natures, what advice would you give to a Christian who is try-
      ing to come to terms with this never-ending struggle with self?

     The Works of the Flesh
       Having introduced the conflict that exists between the flesh and
     the Spirit, Paul, in Galatians 5:18–26, elaborates on the nature of this
     contrast by means of a list of ethical vices and virtues. The catalog of
     vices or virtues was a well-established literary feature present in both
     Jewish and Greco-Roman literature. These lists identified behavior to
     be avoided and virtues to be emulated.

Carefully examine the vice and virtue lists in the passages below.
     In what ways are Paul’s lists in Galatians 5:19–24 similar to, yet
     different from, these lists? Jer. 7:9; Hos. 4:2; Mark 7:21, 22; 1 Tim.
     3:2, 3; 1 Pet. 4:3; Rev. 21:8.
     _______________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________

        Although Paul was well aware of vice and virtue lists, there are
     significant differences in the way he uses the two lists in Galatians.
     First, even though Paul contrasts the two lists, he does not refer to
     them in the same manner. He labels the vice list as the “works of the
     flesh” but the virtue list as the “fruit of the Spirit.” This is an impor-
     tant distinction. As James D. G. Dunn writes, “The flesh demands,
     but the Spirit produces. Where the one list breathes an air of anxious
     self-assertiveness and frenetic self-indulgence, the other speaks more
     of concern for others, serenity, resilience, reliability. The one features
     human manipulation, the other divine enabling or engracing, reinforc-
     ing the point that inner transformation is the source of responsible
     conduct.”—The Epistle to the Galatians, p. 308.
        The second intriguing difference between Paul’s two lists is that
     the vice list is deliberately labeled as plural in number: “works of
     the flesh.” “Fruit of the Spirit,” however, is singular. This difference
     may suggest that the life lived in the flesh can promote nothing more
     than division, turmoil, divisiveness, and disunity. In contrast, the life
     lived in the realm of the Spirit produces one fruit of the Spirit, which
     manifests itself in nine qualities that foster unity.
        In this context, some people claim that what a person believes about
     God does not really matter as long as he or she is sincere. Nothing could
     be farther from the truth. Paul’s list of vices suggests the opposite: cor-
     rupt views about God lead to distorted ideas about sexual behavior and
     religion and ethics, resulting in the breakdown of human relationships.
     Furthermore, they can lead to the loss of eternal life (Gal. 5:21).

      Look through the list of “works of the flesh.” In what ways
      can you see each as a violation of one or more of the Ten
      Commandments?
                                                                            99

      The Fruit of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22–24)
        “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness,
      goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things
      there is no law” (Gal. 5:22, 23, ESV). In what ways does obedience to
      the Ten Commandments reflect the fruit of the Spirit as it is expressed
      in these verses? See also Matt. 5:21, 22, 27, 28; 22:35–40. 		
      						
      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         The Ten Commandments are not an alternative to love; they help
      guide us in how we are to show love, both to God and to humankind.
      However much it might transcend the letter of the law, love is not
      in conflict with the law. The idea that love for God and love for our
      neighbor void the Ten Commandments makes about as much sense as
      saying that love for nature voids the law of gravity.
         Also, in contrast to the 15 one-word descriptions of the works of
      the flesh, the fruit of the Spirit is described in nine elegant virtues.
      Scholars believe these nine virtues are organized into three clusters
      of three, but there is little agreement on the significance of their
      order. Some see an implicit reference to the Trinity in the number
      three; others believe the three triads reflect the ways in which we
      should relate to God, to our neighbor, and, finally, to ourselves; and
      others see the list as essentially a description of Jesus. Although
      each of these views has some merit, the most significant point not
      to be overlooked is the supreme importance Paul places on love in
      the Christian life.
         The fact that Paul lists love as the first of the nine virtues is not
      accidental. He has already highlighted the central role of love in the
      Christian life in Galatians 5:6 and 13, and he includes it in his virtue
      lists elsewhere (2 Cor. 6:6, 1 Tim. 4:12, 6:11, and 2 Tim. 2:22).
      Whereas all the other virtues appear also in non-Christian sources,
      love is distinctly Christian. All this indicates that love should be seen
      not merely as one virtue among many but as the cardinal Christian
      virtue that is the key to all other virtues. Love is the preeminent fruit
      of the Spirit (1 Cor. 13:13, Rom. 5:5), and it should define the life
      and attitudes of every Christian (John 13:34, 35), however difficult at
      times it might be to show love.

       How much self-denial is involved in love? Can you love with-
       out self-denial? What does Jesus teach us about love and self-
       denial?

     The Way to Victory
       Although an inward conflict between the flesh and the Spirit always
     will rage in the heart of every believer, the Christian life does not have
     to be dominated by defeat, failure, and sin.

According to Galatians 5:16–26, what is the key to living a life
     where the Spirit reigns over the flesh?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Galatians 5:16–26 contains five key verbs that describe the type of
     life in which the Spirit reigns. First, the believer needs to “walk” in
     the Spirit (vs. 16). The Greek verb is peripateo, which literally means
     “to walk around or to follow.” The followers of the famous Greek
     philosopher Aristotle came to be known as the Peripatetics because
     they followed Aristotle everywhere he went. The fact that the verb is
     in the present tense implies that Paul is not talking about an occasional
     walk but rather a continuous daily experience. In addition, since it is
     also a command “to walk” in the Spirit, it implies that walking in the
     Spirit is a choice we have to make on a daily basis.
        The second verb is “to be led” (vs. 18). This suggests that we also
     need to allow the Spirit to lead us where we should go (compare Rom.
     8:14, 1 Cor. 12:2). It is not our job to lead but to follow.
        The next two verbs appear in Galatians 5:25. The first is “to live”
     (zao in Greek). By “live,” Paul is referring to the new-birth experience
     that must mark the life of every believer. Paul’s use of the present
     tense points to a new-birth experience that is to be renewed daily.
     Because we live by the Spirit, Paul goes on to write that we also need
     “to walk” by the Spirit. The word translated as “walk” is different
     from the one in verse 16. Here the word is stoicheo. It is a military
     term that literally means “to draw up in a line,” “to keep in step,” or
     “to conform.” The idea here is that the Spirit not only gives us life but
     should direct our lives on a daily basis also.
        The verb Paul uses in verse 24 is “to crucify.” This is a little shock-
     ing. If we are to follow the Spirit, we must make a firm decision
     to put to death the desires of the flesh. Of course, Paul is speaking
     figuratively. We crucify the flesh by feeding our spiritual life and by
     starving the desires of the flesh.

      What changes and choices must you make in order to have the
      victories you are promised in Christ—victories that now con-
      tinually elude you?
                                                                          101

    Further Study: “The life of the Christian is not all smooth. He has
          stern conflicts to meet. Severe temptations assail him. ‘The flesh lust-
          eth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh.’ The nearer we
          come to the close of this earth’s history, the more delusive and ensnar-
          ing will be the attacks of the enemy. His attacks will grow fiercer and
          more frequent. Those who resist light and truth will become more
          hardened and unimpressible, and more bitter against those who love
          God and keep His commandments (MS 33, 1911).”—Ellen G. White
          Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1111.
             “The influence of the Holy Spirit is the life of Christ in the soul. We
1         do not see Christ and speak to Him, but His Holy Spirit is just as near
          us in one place as in another. It works in and through every one who
          receives Christ. Those who know the indwelling of the Spirit reveal
          the fruits of the Spirit—love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness,
          goodness, faith (MS 41, 1897).”—Ellen G. White Comments, The
          SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1112.

    Discussion Questions:
           l
           1 Dwell more on the idea of crucifying the desires of the flesh.
           What does that mean? How do we do it? How often do we have to
           do it? Why would Paul use such a strong verb? What does his use of
           the word crucify tell us about just how hard the battle with self is?

           l2 What role, if any, does human effort play in producing the
3
           fruit of the Spirit? What does your own experience tell you about
           this role?

           l
           3 Paul says that those who practice the works of the flesh will
           not inherit the kingdom of God. How do you reconcile this state-
           ment with the fact that Paul says we are saved by faith and not
           by works?

           l4 In your own walk with the Lord, what’s the biggest struggle
           you face? Is it not sin and what sin does to your relationship with
           God? What Christian hasn’t felt alienation, doubt, and disap-
           pointment as a result of the sin in his or her life, especially because
           we have the promise of victory over that sin? Given this fact in the
           context of victory over sin, why must we always remember that
           our salvation rests totally upon what Jesus has done for us?

    Summary: Although in the life of all believers a conflict exists
          between the desires of the flesh and the desires of the Spirit, the
          Christian life does not have to be doomed to failure. Because Christ
          has conquered the power of sin and death, the Christian life can be
          a life where the Spirit reigns, bringing a daily supply of God’s grace
          that enables us to keep the desires of the flesh at bay.

Internet Evangelism in Finland
by A. Esansaari
   A few years ago, a friend offered me some CDs of sermons from his
pastor. I wondered why Seventh-day Adventist pastors in Finland didn’t
offer their sermons on CDs. It would be a great way to reach out beyond
the church community as well as keep in touch with members who were
ill or away. I asked around and realized that some Seventh-day Adventist
churches in Finland had recorded a few sermons, but virtually no churches
had digital audio materials that could be uploaded to the Internet. In many
churches, the pastor’s sermons weren’t even recorded.
   I felt impressed that we were to make these excellent sermons available to
everyone via the Internet, so I began gathering recorded sermons to transfer
to a digital format. I started with only 10 sermons, but as word spread about
my quest, I soon had more than one hundred sermons to transfer into MP3
files for the Internet.
   Today, we have more than six hundred sermons in our Finnish audio bank
on the Internet. In addition we have uploaded several of Ellen G. White’s
books that are recorded in Finnish as well as some inspirational music.
We’ve also set up a chat room where people can talk about sermons or
books that they’ve listened to on the Web site. This is a tremendous way to
get people involved in the message that they’ve heard.
   I’m convinced that the Internet will play a key part in finishing the work
of reaching people around the world for Christ. I learned that one man
downloads the sermons and shares them with people he meets as his mis-
sionary outreach. And so far, we know two people who have come to know
Christ and the Seventh-day Adventist Church because of this outreach.
   One unexpected blessing from our audio bank of sermons came to light
recently. While most of the sermons on our Internet site are listened to
by individuals, some sermons have been used during worship services in
congregations that have no full-time pastor of their own. The worshipers
can listen to a first-class sermon via the Internet even when there is no
live person to present it.
   I realize that what we’re doing in Finland to spread the good news of
Jesus to others isn’t new. But I hope other language groups around the
world will do the same. It’s an easy form of evangelism, and it’s effective
wherever people have access to a computer. This ministry can be a bless-
ing for countless numbers of people.
   God wants us to use every means available to lead people to Christ,
whether it’s through personal evangelism, the mission offering, or the
Internet. The end result will be souls saved for God’s kingdom.

             ome potato farmers decided to save the biggest potatoes for
             themselves and to plant the smaller potatoes as seed. After a few
             disappointing harvests, they discovered that nature had reduced
      their potato crops to the size of marbles. Through this disaster, those
      farmers learned an important law of life.
        “They could not have the best things of life for themselves and use
      the leftovers for seed. The law of life decreed that the harvest would
      reflect the planting.
        “In another sense, planting small potatoes is still common practice.
      We take the big things of life for ourselves and plant the leftovers. We
      expect that by some crazy twist of spiritual laws, our selfishness will
      be rewarded with unselfishness.”—International Student Fellowship
      Newsletter, March 2007.
        Paul applies this principle in Galatians 6:1–10. Instead of members
      “bit[ing] and devour[ing] one another” (Gal. 5:15), the church should
      be a place where the Spirit leads us to put others before ourselves.
      Understanding that we are saved by grace should make us humble and
      more patient and compassionate in how we treat others.

      Restoring the Fallen
         While Paul has lofty expectations for the nature of the Christian
      life (Gal. 5:16), his counsel to the believers in Galatians 6:1 also
      is refreshingly realistic. Humans are not perfect, and even the most
      dedicated Christians are not immune to mistakes. In Greek, Paul’s
      words in Galatians 5:16 indicate that he is envisioning a situation that
      is likely to happen in the church at some time. Paul gives the Galatians
      practical advice on how to deal with such situations when they arise.

How should Christians respond when a fellow believer falls into some
      sinful behavior? Gal. 6:1, Matt. 18:15–17.
        				
      ________________________________________________________

         To benefit from Paul’s advice in Galatians 6:1, we need to under-
      stand the precise type of situation that Paul has in mind. This revolves
      around two words used in the first half of the sentence. The first word
      is caught (ESV) or overtaken (KJV). It literally means “to be detected,
      overtaken, or surprised.” The context and different nuances associated
      with this word suggest that Paul has two aspects in mind. It refers not
      only to a believer who “catches” another believer in the act of some
      wrongdoing but also to the process by which a person finds himself
      “overtaken” by a behavior (see Prov. 5:22) that, under the best of
      circumstances, he would have chosen to avoid.
         The likelihood that the wrongdoing Paul is discussing is not delib-
      erate is evident from the terminology he uses. The word translated
      “fault” (KJV) or “sin” (NIV), which comes from the Greek word
      paraptoma, does not refer to a deliberate sin but rather to a mistake,
      a stumble, or a false step. The latter makes particular sense in light
      of Paul’s previous comments about “walking” in the Spirit. Although
      this in no way excuses the person’s mistake, it makes clear that Paul
      is not dealing with a case of defiant sin (1 Cor. 5:1–5).
         The proper response in such circumstances should not be punishment,
      condemnation, or disfellowship but restoration. The Greek word trans-
      lated “restore” is katartizo and means “to mend” or “to put in order.” In
      the New Testament it is used as “mending” fishnets (Matt. 4:21), and in
      Greek literature it is used as a medical term describing the process of set-
      ting a broken bone. In the same way that we would not abandon a fellow
      believer who fell and broke a leg, as members of the body of Christ we
      should gently care for our brothers and sisters in Christ who may stumble
      and fall as we walk together on the path to God’s kingdom.

       Instead of practicing Matthew 18:15–17, why do we so often
       talk badly about the person with whom we’re angry, let our anger
       simmer against the person, or even plan revenge?
                                                                             105

      Beware of Temptation
        “And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man” (2 Sam. 12:7).

         The seriousness of Paul’s words in Galatians 6:1—to guard our
      own lives lest we also follow into temptation—should not be over-
      looked. An indication of the urgency and personal concern behind
      Paul’s counsel can be seen in the way he makes his appeal. The word
      translated “considering” (KJV) or “take care” (NRSV) literally means
      “to look at carefully” or “to pay careful attention to” (compare Rom.
      16:17, Phil. 2:4). So, what Paul literally is saying is, “keep a careful
      eye on yourself” lest sin also takes you by surprise. To highlight this
      warning, Paul switches from the second person plural (“you all”) in
      the first half of Galatians 6:1 to the second person singular (“you”)
      in the last half of the verse. This is no general warning that applies
      to the whole congregation; it is a personal warning addressed to each
      individual within the church.
         Paul does not explicitly identify the nature of the temptation that
      he so strongly warns the Galatians against. Perhaps he didn’t have
      one specific trespass in mind but was simply referring to the danger
      of committing the same sin, whatever it is, from which they are try-
      ing to restore another. At the same time, his words in Galatians 5:26
      against becoming “conceited” (NKJV) suggest that he is warning
      them against feeling that they are in some way spiritually superior to
      those whom they are restoring.

Why would Paul need to warn the Galatians against spiritual pride?
      Consider 1 Cor. 10:12, Matt. 26:34, 2 Sam. 12:1–7.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         One of the greatest dangers to the Christian walk is a sense of
      spiritual pride that makes us think we are somehow immune to com-
      mitting certain types of sin. The sobering fact is that we all have the
      same sinful nature—a nature that is opposed to God. Thus, without
      the restraining power of God’s Spirit, we could stoop to just about
      any sin, given the right circumstances. Such an awareness of our true
      identity outside of Christ can keep us from falling into the sin of self-
      righteousness, and it also can give us greater sympathy for others who
      make mistakes.

       How many times have you found yourself condemning others
       (maybe even only in your heart) for doing sins that, one day,
       you were guilty of yourself?

      Burden Bearing (Gal. 6:2–5)
In addition to restoring the fallen, what other instructions does Paul
      give to the believers in Galatia? Gal. 6:2–5; see also Rom. 15:1,
      Matt. 7:12.


         The Greek word translated “burden” in Galatians 6:5 is baros. It
      literally referred to a heavy weight or load that someone had to carry
      a long distance. Over time, however, it became a metaphor for any
      type of trouble or difficulty, such as the burden of a long day’s work
      on a hot day (Matt. 20:12). While the immediate context of Paul’s
      injunction to “bear one another’s burdens” certainly includes the
      moral lapses of the fellow believers mentioned in the preceding verse,
      the concept of burden bearing that he has in mind is much broader.
      Paul’s instructions reveal several spiritual insights about the Christian
      life that should not be overlooked.
         First, as Timothy George notes, “All Christians have burdens. Our
      burdens may differ in size and shape and will vary in kind depend-
      ing on the providential order of our lives. For some it is the burden of
      temptation and the consequences of a moral lapse, as in verse 1 here.
      For others it may be a physical ailment, or a mental disorder, or a family
      crisis, or lack of employment, or demonic oppression, or a host of other
      things; but no Christian is exempt from burdens.”—Galatians, p. 413.
         Second, God does not intend for us to bear all our burdens alone.
      Unfortunately, we often are far more willing to help others to carry their
      burdens than we are in allowing others to help us shoulder our own. Paul
      condemns this attitude of self-sufficiency (Gal. 6:3) as human pride—
      when we refuse to admit that we also have needs and weaknesses. Such
      pride not only robs us of the comfort of others but also prevents others
      from fulfilling the ministry that God has called them to perform.
         Finally, God calls us to bear the burdens of others because it
      is through our actions that God’s comfort is made manifest. This
      concept is built on the fact that the church is the body of Christ. An
      illustration of this is in Paul’s words, “But God, who comforts the
      downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus” (2 Cor. 7:6, ESV).
      Notice that “God’s comfort was not given to Paul through his private
      prayer and waiting upon the Lord but through the companionship of a
      friend and through the good news that he brought.
         “Human friendship, in which we bear one another’s burdens, is
      part of the purpose of God for His people.”—John R. W. Stott, The
      Message of Galatians, p. 158.

       What keeps you from seeking help—pride, shame, lack of trust,
       a sense of self-sufficiency? If in need, why not seek out someone
       whom you trust and ask this person to share your burdens?
                                                                           107

      The Law of Christ (Gal. 6:2–5)
Paul connects burden bearing with fulfilling the law of Christ. What
      does he mean by “the law of Christ”? Gal. 5:14, 6:2, John 13:34,
      Matt. 22:34–40.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         Paul’s use of the phrase “the law of Christ” (ton nomon tou
      Christou) occurs nowhere else in the Bible, although he uses a similar
      expression in 1 Corinthians 9:21 (ennomos Christou). The unique-
      ness of this phrase has resulted in a number of different interpre-
      tations. Some mistakenly argue that this is evidence that the law
      of God given at Sinai has been replaced by a different law, the
      law of Christ. Others claim the word law simply means a general
      “principle” (see Rom. 7:21), meaning that in bearing the burdens of
      others we are following the example of Jesus. While the latter inter-
      pretation has some merit, the context and similar terminology with
      Galatians 5:14 suggest that “fulfilling the law of Christ” is another
      reference to fulfilling the moral law through love. Paul showed ear-
      lier in his letter that the moral law was not annulled with the coming
      of Christ. Instead, the moral law as interpreted by love continues
      to play an important role in the Christian life. This is the epitome
      of what Jesus taught during His earthly ministry and also practiced
      throughout His life and even in His death. In bearing the burdens of
      others, we are not only following in the footsteps of Jesus, we are
      also fulfilling the law.
         Another issue arises in these texts, the apparent contradiction
      between Galatians 6:2 and 6:5. This problem, however, is easily
      resolved when one realizes that Paul is using two different words to
      describe two different situations. As we have already seen, the word
      for burden in verse 2 (baros) refers to a heavy load that has to be car-
      ried for a long distance. The word phortion in verse 5, however, refers
      to a ship’s cargo, a soldier’s backpack, or even a child in the womb.
      Whereas the former burdens can be laid aside, the latter cannot. A
      pregnant mother must carry her own child. As this example suggests,
      there are some burdens that people can help us bear but others that
      no human can bear for us, such as the burden of a guilty conscience,
      suffering, and death. For these, we must rely on God’s help alone
      (Matt. 11:28–30).

       While you can get help from other people with some burdens,
       some you have to take to the Lord alone. How can you learn to
       give to the Lord the things that you, yourself, just can’t bear?

     Sowing and Reaping (Gal. 6:6–10)

        In Galatians 6:7, the word translated “mocked” (mukterizo) occurs
     only here in the New Testament, although it often appears in the Greek
     translation of the Old Testament. It literally means “to turn up one’s nose
     in contempt.” In the Old Testament it typically refers to the despising of
     God’s prophets (2 Chron. 36:16, Jer. 20:7), and it even is used once to
     describe graphically a rebellious attitude toward God (Ezek. 8:17).
        Paul’s point is that people may ignore God or even flout His com-
     mandments, but they cannot outwit God. He is the ultimate judge, and
     in the end they will have to pay the price for their actions.

Read Galatians 6:8. What does Paul mean here? What examples can
     you find in the Bible of characters sowing to the flesh and sowing
     to the Spirit? See, for example, Acts 5:1–5, Luke 22:3, Dan. 1:8,
     Matt. 4:1.

     ________________________________________________________

        Paul’s metaphor about sowing and reaping is not unique. It is a
     fact of life that appears in many ancient proverbial sayings. What
     is significant, however, is how Paul uses it to highlight his previous
     comments about the flesh and the Spirit. James D. G. Dunn notes, “A
     modern equivalent is that we are free to choose, but we are not free to
     choose the consequences of our choice.”—Galatians, p. 330.
        Although God does not always deliver us from the earthly conse-
     quences of our sins, we should not be overcome with despair for the
     bad choices we have made. We can rejoice that God has forgiven us
     of our sins and adopted us as His children. We should capitalize on
     the opportunities we have now to invest in those things that will yield
     a heavenly harvest.
        Galatians 6:10, meanwhile, illustrates the point that “Christian eth-
     ics has a dual focus: one is universal and all-embracing, ‘Let us do
     good to all people’; the other is particular and specific, ‘especially
     to those who belong to the family of believers.’ Paul’s universalistic
     appeal was based on the fact that all persons everywhere are created
     in the image of God and are thus infinitely precious in his sight.
     Whenever Christians have forgotten this primary datum of biblical
     revelation, they have inevitably fallen victim to the blinding sins of
     racism, sexism, tribalism, classism, and a thousand other bigotries
     that have blighted the human community from Adam and Eve to the
     present day.”—Timothy George, Galatians, pp. 427, 428.

      You are sowing, either for good or bad. Look at yourself. What
      kind of harvest are you going to reap?
                                                                           109

    Further Study: “The Spirit of God keeps evil under the control of con-
          science. When man exalts himself above the influence of the Spirit,
          he reaps a harvest of iniquity. Over such a man the Spirit has less
          and less influence to restrain him from sowing seeds of disobedience.
          Warnings have less and less power over him. He gradually loses his
          fear of God. He sows to the flesh; he will reap corruption. The harvest
          of the seed that he himself has sown, is ripening. He has a contempt
          for God’s holy commandments. His heart of flesh becomes a heart of
1         stone. Resistance to truth confirms him in iniquity. It is because men
          sowed seeds of evil, that lawlessness, crime, and violence prevailed
          in the antediluvian world.
             “All should be intelligent in regard to the agency by which the
          soul is destroyed. It is not because of any decree that God has sent
          out against man. He does not make man spiritually blind. God gives
2         sufficient light and evidence to enable man to distinguish truth from
          error. But He does not force man to receive truth. He leaves him free
          to choose the good or to choose the evil. If man resists evidence that
          is sufficient to guide his judgment in the right direction, and chooses
          evil once, he will do this more readily the second time. The third time
          he will still more eagerly withdraw himself from God and choose to
          stand on the side of Satan. And in this course he will continue until he
          is confirmed in evil, and believes the lie he has cherished as truth. His
3         resistance has produced its harvest (MS 126, 1901).”—Ellen G. White
          Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1112.

    Discussion Questions:
           l1 In a practical sense, what does it really mean to “restore” a
           fellow believer who has fallen into sin? In what ways does the
           nature of the sin committed affect the restoration process? Does
           restoration mean that everything will be the same as before?
           Discuss.

           l2 Because there are some burdens that people must bear on
           their own (Gal. 6:5), how does a believer determine if he or she
           should try to help someone?

           l
           3 How does your church measure up to Paul’s instructions in
           Galatians 6? What can you do personally to make a difference?

    Summary: The indication of God’s presence among His people is
          in the Christlike spirit manifest within the church. It can be seen in
          the way forgiveness and restoration are extended to those who err, in
          how they help each other in trials, and in intentional acts of kindness
          shared not only among themselves but also with unbelievers.

United at Last
by Sumakwel Laviña
   “Look,” I told my three teenagers, “we need to be united in our faith.
We go to one church, and your new mom goes to another. But you don’t
like either church. Then find a faith we all can follow.” It was a challenge,
but I didn’t really expect them to meet it. However, God had other plans.
   I’m from a tribal area of southern Philippines, and my wife is from an
island. We belonged to different Christian churches, and I wanted to be
united in our faith. So I sent my children to my wife’s church. But they
found it boring. We talked about it and decided to find a church we all
could agree on, one we’d all attend.
   My wife met a man at the school where she teaches. They talked a bit,
and when she learned that he was a Seventh-day Adventist Christian, she
asked him to come and study the Bible with us. A day or two later, the
man came by and introduced himself. He wanted to be sure that it was OK
to come and study the Bible with me. We decided to meet on Sundays.
   We studied the Bible together with varying degrees of interest. Another
Protestant asked to study with us, so we had two Bible studies on Sundays
for more than a year. Eventually, we visited the Seventh-day Adventist
church and really enjoyed it.
   First my daughter and then my sons decided to join the Seventh-day
Adventist Church. They challenged my wife and me to follow their
example and become a family united in faith. I felt that the Adventists
taught the truth, and I was reminded that we had begun these Bible studies
to be united in one faith. We all attended church together, so I asked my
wife to join me in making the Seventh-day Adventist Church our home.
But her family pressured her to stay in the church of her childhood. So I
took my stand alone.
   A ministerial intern needed a place to stay, so we invited him to live
with us. He taught us how to have family worship and showed us the
beauty of praising God together and discussing what we were learning.
Family worship helped convince my wife to step out in faith and join the
family in the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
   At last we’re united in Christ. I never dreamed that our children and
their example of faithfulness would lead to where God wanted us to be. I
thank God for them and for faithful Seventh-day Adventists in our town
and around the world who make mission and outreach an important part
of being a Seventh-day Adventist.

      Boasting in the Cross

      12:1–8; 2 Cor. 4:10; 5:17; 11:23–29.

Memory Text: “But far be it from me to boast except in the cross

      to me, and I to the world” (Galatians 6:14, ESV).



      T
             his study on Galatians has been intense. That’s because the
             letter itself is intense. Knowing his calling, knowing the truth
             of what he preached (after all, as he said numerous times, that
      truth came from the Lord), Paul wrote with the inspired passion of
      the Old Testament prophets, of an Isaiah, a Jeremiah, a Hosea. Just as
      they pleaded with the people of God in their time to turn away from
      their error, Paul here is doing the same with those in his time.
         No matter how different the immediate circumstances were, in the
      end the words of Jeremiah could just as easily apply to the Galatians
      as they did to those in Jeremiah’s day: “Thus saith the Lord, let not the
      wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his
      might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: but let him that glorieth
      glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord
      which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the
      earth: for in these things I delight, saith the Lord” (Jer. 9:23, 24).
         Nowhere do our “glorious” human wisdom, our riches, and our
      might appear more clearly in all their futility and vanity than before
      the Cross of Christ—the focus of Paul’s letter to his erring flock in
      Galatia.

     Paul’s Own Hand
Compare Paul’s closing remarks in Galatians 6:11–18 to the final
     remarks he makes in his other letters. In what way is the ending
     of Galatians similar to, and different from, them? See the final
     remarks in Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Ephesians, Philippians,
     Colossians, and 1 and 2 Thessalonians.
       							
     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Paul’s closing remarks are not always uniform, but a number of
     common elements appear in them: (1) greetings to specific individu-
     als, (2) a final exhortation, (3) a personal signature, and (4) a closing
     benediction. When these typical features are compared to Paul’s final
     remarks in Galatians, two significant differences appear.
        First, unlike many of Paul’s letters, Galatians contains no personal
     greetings. Why? As with the absence of the traditional thanksgiving
     at the beginning of the letter, this is probably a further indication of
     the strained relationship between Paul and the Galatians. Paul is polite
     but formal.
        Second, we must remember that it was Paul’s custom to dictate his
     letters to a scribe (Rom. 16:22). Then after finishing, Paul often would
     take the pen himself and write a few brief words with his own hand
     to end the letter (1 Cor. 16:21). In Galatians, however, Paul deviates
     from his practice. When he takes the pen from the scribe, Paul is still
     so concerned with the circumstances in Galatia that he ends up writing
     more instead. He simply cannot put the pen down until he pleads with
     the Galatians once more to turn from their foolish ways.
        In Galatians 6:11 Paul stresses that he wrote the letter with large
     letters. We really don’t know why. Some have speculated that Paul
     was not referring to the size of the letters but to their misshaped form.
     They suggest that perhaps Paul’s hands were either so crippled from
     persecution or gnarled from tent making that he could not form his
     letters with precision. Others believe his comments provide further
     evidence of his poor eyesight. Although both views are possible, it
     seems far less speculative to conclude simply that Paul was intention-
     ally writing with large letters in order to underscore and reemphasize
     his point, similar to the way we might emphasize an important word
     or concept by underlining it, putting it in italics, or writing it in
     CAPITAL LETTERS.
        Whatever the reason, Paul certainly wanted the readers to heed his
     warning and admonitions.
                                                                         113

      Boasting in the Flesh
Read Galatians 6:12, 13. What is Paul saying in these verses?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         Although Paul has hinted previously about the agenda and motiva-
      tion of his opponents (see Gal. 1:7, 4:17), his remarks in Galatians
      6:12, 13 are the first explicit comments he makes about his opponents.
      He describes them as wanting “to make a good showing in the flesh”
      (ESV). The phrase “a good showing” in Greek literally means to put
      on “a good face.” In fact, the word for “face” is the same in Greek
      as the word for an actor’s mask, and this word was even used figu-
      ratively to refer to the role played by an actor. In other words, Paul
      is saying that these people were like actors seeking the approval of
      an audience. In a culture based on honor and shame, conformity is
      essential, and those teaching the errors appear to have been seeking
      to improve their honor rating before their fellow Jews in Galatia and
      other Jewish Christians back in Jerusalem.
         Paul makes an important point about one of their motives—the desire
      to avoid persecution. Although persecution can certainly be understood
      in its more dramatic forms involving physical abuse, it can be just as
      damaging even in its more “mild” forms of harassment and exclusion.
      Paul and other fanatical zealots in Judea had once carried out the former
      type (Gal. 1:13), but the latter also had its effect on Christians.
         The Jewish religious leaders still had significant political influence in
      many areas. They had the official sanction of Rome; hence, many Jewish
      believers were eager to maintain good relations with them. By circumcis-
      ing Gentiles and teaching them to observe the Torah, the troublemakers
      in Galatia could find a point of common ground with the local Jews. Not
      only would this allow them to maintain friendly contact with the syna-
      gogues, but they could even strengthen their ties with the Jewish believers
      in Jerusalem, who had a growing suspicion about the work being done
      with the Gentiles (Acts 21:20, 21). No doubt, too, in one sense their
      actions could have made their witness to the Jews more effective.
         Whatever situation Paul has in mind, his meaning is clear: “All who
      desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution” (2 Tim.
      3:12, NKJV).

       Think through the reason these people had for teaching their
       errors. It sounds pretty reasonable, all things considered. What
       should this tell us about how even the “best” of motives can
       lead us astray if we aren’t careful? When was the last time you
       ended up doing wrong things for the right motives?

     Boasting in the Cross (Gal. 6:14)
       “But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our
     Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I
     unto the world” (Gal. 6:14).

       Having exposed the motives that prompted some to insist on cir-
     cumcision, Paul presents his gospel message to the Galatians one final
     time, although only in summary form. For Paul, the gospel is based
     on two fundamental tenets: (1) the centrality of the Cross (vs. 14) and
     (2) the doctrine of justification (vs. 15). In today’s lesson the focus is
     on the former.
       Living in the twenty-first century, it is difficult to comprehend the
     shock that Paul’s comments about the Cross (Gal. 6:14) originally
     conveyed. Today the cross of Christ is a common and cherished
     symbol that evokes positive feelings for most people. In Paul’s day,
     however, the cross was not something to boast of but something to be
     despised. Jews found the idea of a crucified Messiah offensive, and
     Romans found crucifixion so repulsive that it was not even mentioned
     as a form of punishment suitable for a Roman citizen.
       The contempt with which the ancient world looked upon the cross of
     Christ is clearly seen in the earliest drawing of the crucifixion on record.
     Dating back to the early second century, a piece of ancient graffiti depicts
     the crucifixion of a man with the head of a donkey. Below the cross
     and adjacent to a drawing of a man with his hands raised in worship, an
     inscription reads, “Alexander worships his god.” The point is clear: the
     cross of Christ is deemed ridiculous. It is in this context that Paul boldly
     declares that he can boast of nothing other than the cross of Christ!

What difference did the cross of Christ make in Paul’s relationship
     to the world? Gal. 6:14, Rom. 6:1–6, 12:1–8, Phil. 3:8.

       The cross of Christ changes everything for the believer. It chal-
     lenges us not only to reevaluate how we view ourselves but also how
     we relate to the world. The world—this present evil age and all that it
     entails (1 John 2:16)—stands in opposition to God. Because we have
     died with Christ, the world no longer has the enslaving power it once
     held over us, and the old life that we once lived for the world is no
     longer. Following Paul’s analogy, the break between the believer and
     the world should be as if the two died to each other.

      What has the Cross done to affect your relationship to the
      world? What difference has it made in your life? How differ-
      ently do you live now than you did before giving yourself to the
      Lord, who died for you?

                                                                            115

      A New Creation
        Having emphasized the centrality of the cross of Christ to the
      Christian life, Paul now emphasizes the second fundamental tenet of
      his gospel message: justification by faith.
        As we have seen all quarter, Paul has basically pitted circumcision
      against the gospel. Yet, he’s not against the practice itself. Paul has made
      several strong statements against circumcision (see Gal. 5:2–4), but he
      does not want the Galatians to conclude that being uncircumcised is more
      pleasing to God than being circumcised. That is not his point, because one
      can be just as legalistic about what one does as about what one doesn’t
      do. Spiritually speaking, the issue of circumcision by itself is irrelevant.
      True religion is not rooted in external behavior but in the condition of the
      human heart. As Jesus Himself said, a person can look wonderful on the
      outside but be spiritually rotten on the inside (Matt. 23:27).

What does it mean to be a new creation? Gal. 6:15, 2 Cor. 5:17. How
      have you yourself experienced what this means?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         Ktisis is the Greek word translated “creation.” It either can refer to
      an individual “creature” (Heb. 4:13) or to all of the “created” order
      itself (Rom. 8:22). In either case, the word implies the action of a
      Creator. That is Paul’s point. Becoming a “new creature” is not some-
      thing that can be brought about by any human effort—whether it be
      circumcision or anything else. Jesus refers to this process as the “new
      birth” (John 3:5–8). It is the divine act in which God takes a person
      who is spiritually dead and breathes spiritual life into him. This is
      yet another metaphor to describe the saving act that Paul typically
      describes as justification by faith.
         Paul refers to this new creation experience in greater detail in
      2 Corinthians 5:17. In this verse, Paul explains that becoming a new
      creation means far more than just a change in our status in the books of
      heaven; it brings about a change in our lives today. As Timothy George
      notes, it “involves the whole process of conversion: the regenerating
      work of the Holy Spirit leading to repentance and faith, the daily process
      of mortification and vivification, continual growth in holiness leading to
      eventual conformity to the image of Christ.”—Galatians, p. 438.
         Becoming a new creature, however, is not what justifies us. This
      radical change is, instead, the unmistakable manifestation of what it
      means to be justified.

     Final Remarks (Gal. 6:16–18)

Paul bestows his blessing on those who, he says, “follow this rule”
     (Gal. 6:16, NIV, NRSV). Given the context, what “rule” do you
     think Paul is talking about?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        The word translated “rule” literally refers to a straight rod or bar used
     by masons and carpenters for measuring. The word eventually took on a
     figurative meaning referring to the rules or standards by which a person
     evaluates something. For example, when people talk about the New
     Testament canon, they are referring to the twenty-seven books in the
     New Testament, which are seen as authoritative for determining both
     the belief and practice of the church. Therefore, if a teaching does not
     “measure up” to what is found in these books, it is not accepted.

What are the “marks of the Lord Jesus” that Paul bears on his body?
     What does he mean when he writes that no one should “trouble”
     him because of them? Might Galatians 6:14 help answer this
     question? Gal. 6:17, 2 Cor. 4:10, 11:23–29.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       The word mark comes from the Greek word stigmata, from which the
     English word stigma also is derived. Paul may be referring to the common
     practice of the branding of slaves with the insignia of their master as a
     form of identification, or to the practice in some mystery religions where
     a devotee branded himself or herself as a sign of devotion. In any case,
     “by ‘the marks of the Lord Jesus’ Paul doubtless refers to the scars left
     upon his body by persecution and hardship (see 2 Cor. 4:10, 11:24–27).
     His opponents now insist on compelling his Gentile converts to accept the
     mark of circumcision as a token of their submission to Judaism. But Paul
     has marks that indicate whose slave he has become, and for him there is
     no other loyalty than to Christ. . . . The scars Paul had received from his
     enemies while in the service of his Master spoke most eloquently of
     his devotion to Christ.”—Ellen G. White Comments, The SDA Bible
     Commentary, vol. 6, p. 989.

      What are the “marks,” physical or otherwise, that you have
      accumulated because of your faith in Jesus? In other words,
      what has your faith cost you?
                                                                            117

Further Study: “The cross of Calvary challenges, and will finally
      vanquish every earthly and hellish power. In the cross all influence
      centers, and from it all influence goes forth. It is the great center of
      attraction; for on it Christ gave up His life for the human race. This
      sacrifice was offered for the purpose of restoring man to his original
      perfection. Yea, more, it was offered to give him an entire transforma-
      tion of character, making him more than a conqueror.
         “Those who in the strength of Christ overcome the great enemy of
      God and man, will occupy a position in the heavenly courts above
      angels who have never fallen.
         Christ declares, ‘I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all
      men unto me.’ If the cross does not find an influence in its favor, it
      creates an influence. Through generation succeeding generation, the
      truth for this time is revealed as present truth. Christ on the cross was
      the medium whereby mercy and truth met together, and righteousness
      and peace kissed each other. This is the means that is to move the
      world (MS 56, 1899).”—Ellen G. White Comments, The SDA Bible
      Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1113.

Discussion Questions:
       l
       1 What significance do you find in the fact that Paul both begins
       and ends his letter with reference to God’s grace? Compare Gal.
       1:3 and 6:18.

       l
       2 In light of Paul’s statement about having been “crucified . . . to
       the world” (Gal. 6:14), what relationship should Christians have
       with the world today? How should Christians relate to issues deal-
       ing with the environment, racism, abortion, and so on, if they have
       died to the world?

       l
       3 How does a person know if he or she has experienced the
       “new creation” about which Paul writes?

       l4 Based on what you have learned this quarter, how would you
       summarize Paul’s views on the following topics: the law, works
       of law, justification by faith, the old and new covenants, the work
       of Christ, and the nature of the Christian life?

Summary: True religion does not consist of outward behavior but the
      condition of the heart. When the heart is surrendered to God, a per-
      son’s life will more and more reflect the character of Christ as he or
      she grows in faith. The heart must be subdued by Christ; when that
      happens, all else will follow.

The Stranger
  by Geraldo Makinano

   I slumped onto a fallen tree in the thick forest to wait for my partner and
fellow student missionary to catch up to me. We still had 20 miles to hike,
and we were tired and thirsty.
   Suddenly, I realized that we were in rebel territory, where soldiers roam
searching for “the enemy.” They might shoot us before we could explain
who we are. “Lord,” I whispered, “please protect us.” A few minutes later,
we started up the trail again. I saw a stranger watching our every move.
   “Hello, Brother!” I called to him.
   “Military?” he asked.
   “No, we’re missionary teachers,” I answered.
   He smiled. “Do you have a minute? I have some questions.” We sat
down again to talk.
   The man introduced himself as a rebel leader who had killed many
people. Then he asked, “Who are you—really? I know you are teachers
providing our people free education. But why are you risking your lives
in these mountains for our children?”
   “We are Seventh-day Adventists,” I said. “We are in these mountains to
tell people about a better life, a life when conflicts will end and Jesus will
reign. We teach people to read so they can read for themselves the truths
of God before it’s too late.”
   I noticed that the stranger seemed to be in a hurry. “Does what I’ve said
make sense to you?” I asked.
   “Yes, but pray for me,” he said as he stood abruptly and pointed. “Take
this trail. The other one is dangerous.” We thanked him and took the trail
he pointed out.
   The next day, we learned that rebel and government soldiers had fought
on the trail we had planned to take. If we had continued on that trail, we
would have been caught in the cross fire.
   A month later, at an area-wide worship in our village, we were surprised
to meet the stranger from the trail. “Friends,” he said smiling, “I’m now
a Seventh-day Adventist! After we met on the trail that day, I wanted to
know more truth. Now I’m saved. Thank you!”
   “Praise God!” I said. “And had you not told us about the other trail that
day, we would have been caught in the cross fire. We, too, were saved by
God’s grace.”

2012    Bible Study Guide for the First Quarter

          Next quarter, the Adult Bible Study Guide, entitled Glimpses of Our
       God, by Jo Ann Davidson, will look at God, at various aspects of Him
       as they have been revealed to us, and at what these things mean for us on
       a practical level. The lesson study will begin by examining the Trinity:
       the amazing teaching that God is One God and yet composed of three
       Persons. From there, the study will focus on God as Creator, the doctrine
       that forms the foundation of all that we believe. But being created isn’t
       enough. We need to be redeemed as well. So we will look also at His
       work of redemption, as a God of both grace and judgment. We will look
       at His holiness, His law, and the Sabbath—all of which stem from the
       essence of His character and help us to understand more about what He
       is like. How grateful we should be, then, for every bit of light the Lord
       casts our way. This quarter we will look at some of that light. It is up to
       each of us, individually, as to how faithfully we will walk in it.

Lesson 1—The Triune God
       The Week at a Glance:
         Sunday: The Oneness of God (Exodus 3:13–15)
         Monday: The Deity of Christ (Philippians 2:6)
         Tuesday: The Holy Spirit (Genesis 1:2)

       Memory Text—Jude 20–21
       Sabbath Gem: Scripture contains references and hints to the deity
       and unity of the divine Godhead. The distinctions among God,
       Christ, and the Holy Spirit found in the Bible, must be understood
       as being the way God is in Himself, however difficult this is for our
       fallen minds to grasp.

Lesson 2—In the Beginning
       The Week at a Glance:
          Sunday: Creation Week (Genesis 1:1)
          Monday: The Heart of the Creator (Job 38:4–7)
          Tuesday: The Heavens Declare (Psalm 19)
          Wednesday: The Cross and Creation (John 1:1–13)

                                      of an unstoppable love?

because we were made in the image of a loving God? Is
it possible that this God of love is searching for you?
