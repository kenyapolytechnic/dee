         The Adult Sabbath School Bible Study Guide is prepared by the Office of the Adult
         Bible Study Guide of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. The
         preparation of the guides is under the general direction of the Sabbath School
         Publications Board, a subcommittee of the General Conference Administrative
         Commitee (ADCOM), publisher of the Bible study guides. The published guide
         reflects the input of a worldwide evaluation committee and the approval of the
         Sabbath School Publications Board and thus does not solely or necessarily repre-
         sent the intent of the author(s).

Jesus Wept

A                s humans, we are the most rational of all the world’s created beings.
                 Marvelous as they are, frogs, dogs, caterpillars, and donkeys don’t
                 have our capacity to reason. Yet, even with all our powers of logic
and rationality, we’re also emotional beings. One could argue, justifiably, that emo-
tions rule our lives to a much greater extent than reason does or ever could.
   Emotions are good; without them we’d barely be human. (What kind of person
doesn’t know love, compassion, sympathy, fear, or sorrow?) Robots might be able
to function emotionlessly; we never could.
   Of course, existing in a world of sin, our emotions often bring us great pain.
Sickness, disease, war, poverty, natural disasters, economic uncertainty, family
problems—how can these not cause the kinds of fear, sorrow, dread, and sadness
that we all are so familiar with?
   Look, too, at the emotional reaction our world evoked in Jesus! “Jesus wept”
(John 11:35). “And when he [Jesus] had looked round about on them with anger”
(Mark 3:5), Jesus said, “My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death” (Mark 14:34).
“When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with
her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled” (John 11:33). “He is despised and
rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief ” (Isa. 53:3).
   Well did Hebrews express this incredible truth about our Lord: “For we have
not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but
was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin” (Heb. 4:15). That’s the
feelings of our infirmities, and, as we all know, the feelings of our infirmities can
be pretty bad.
   Sadness, pain, sorrow . . . these are not wrong, these are not sinful. We don’t
show a lack of faith, a lack of trust, when we respond to life’s turmoil with such
emotions. After all, Jesus responded with emotions.
   We are, today, thousands of years from the “tree of life” (Gen. 2:9). The DNA is
wearing thin. We’re damaged goods, and, contrary to
the myths of evolution, we’re getting only worse.             Instead of being in
   It’s no wonder, then, that sin has taken its toll on our
emotional health, as well. So often, instead of being in
                                                              control of our emo-

doesn’t always need to be the case. The Lord has some-
thing better for us.

emotions and seek the power of the Lord to bring them
under His loving sovereignty. We’ll look at Bible char-
acters, focusing on their emotional reactions to whatever befell them, good and bad,
and ask ourselves the important question: What can we learn from their experiences
that can help us with ours?
   Of course, some people—especially those whose emotional problems are caused
by a physical problem, such as a chemical imbalance—need professional help when
available, though in no situation should we limit the power of God to bring healing
to any life.
   It’s our prayer that this quarter’s lessons will, in the context of understanding
our emotions, help us reach out to the Lord, who has bestowed on us the greatest
emotion of all: love. Finally, no matter our emotional ups and downs, may each of
us learn to bask in that love, especially in the downs, and then through God’s grace
reflect that love to others. Because, in the end, no matter our sorrows, “love never
fails” (1 Cor. 13:8, NIV).

Read for This Week’s Study: 2 Samuel 13, Gal. 5:22,
  Col. 3:12–14, Luke 19:41–44, John 16:20–24.
				
Memory Text: “ ‘I tell you the truth, you will weep and mourn
  while the world rejoices. You will grieve, but your grief will turn
  to joy’ ” (John 16:20, NIV).



      E
             motions are a vital part of the human personality. They can be
             powerful motivators, both for good and for evil. And, depending
             on the emotions, they make us happy, sad, fearful, or joyous.
         Positive emotions can bring a feeling of satisfaction and well-being;
      negative ones tend to cause pain and anguish. Though the first ones
      can promote mental health, a prolonged exposure to negative emo-
      tions may bring about behavioral and relational problems. Thus, emo-
      tions can play an important part in our overall well-being.
         God wants us to enjoy the effects of positive emotions. However,
      because of sin, we often face the adverse effects of negative emotional
      experiences. Bible characters were not immune to emotional ups and
      downs either. Some succeeded in gaining control over them; others, los-
      ing control, allowed negative emotions to lead them into wrong actions.
         The relationship between emotions and behavior is not clear and
      direct. At times painful emotions may drive us to our knees to seek
      God as the ultimate Source of help and support. At other times strug-
      gles may cause people to give up faith entirely.
         How crucial, then, that we learn more about our emotions and how
      they impact our lives.

      Negative Emotions
        Read 2 Samuel 13, a story packed with adverse emotional experi-
      ences. In the midst of this turmoil, people ended up inflicting much
      physical and emotional pain on one another. The consequences of
      their behavior touched the entire royal family, impacting even future
      generations.

What emotional states can be identified in the following participants?

      Amnon_________________________________________________

      Tamar__________________________________________________

      David__________________________________________________

      Absalom________________________________________________

         Amnon’s “love” for Tamar could not have been true love, but rather
      a strong sexual drive, because as soon as he achieved his goal he
      “hated her with intense hatred. In fact, he hated her more than he had
      loved her” (vs. 15, NIV). Amnon’s experience illustrates emotional
      extremes: uncontrolled passion (in the context of an incestuous rela-
      tionship) and hatred. Behaviors performed under such emotional states
      almost always will be unbalanced and cause serious consequences.
      Amnon’s “love” turned almost instantly into hatred. He disdained his
      sister’s final plea and drove her out of his quarters by force.
         Tamar was truly the victim. She did not permit any of Amnon’s
      advances, which frustrated him. She served her brother in obedience
      to the king. And when Amnon’s intentions became clear, she did her
      best to dissuade him and to outline the devastating consequences of
      such a wicked act. Being determined to do what he wanted, Amnon
      was not ready to seek sound advice. So, he proceeded with his plan.
         As any woman who has suffered rape or abuse, Tamar must have
      felt angry, humiliated, and used; she surely suffered with significantly
      lowered self-esteem. Her brother Absalom did not offer much relief
      but instead advised her to keep silent. However, Absalom devised a
      plan to kill Amnon in order to avenge her rape. (Besides, getting rid
      of Amnon increased his chances to sit on the throne of Israel.) David,
      father of all involved, experienced anger and grief over these events.

       When have you experienced hatred, sadness, fear, rage, or jeal-
       ousy? How did you deal with them? What do you wish you had
       done differently?

     Positive Emotions
        Negative emotional states, such as hatred, worry, fear, rage, and jeal-
     ousy, produce immediate physiological responses: a pounding heart,
     tense muscles, dryness of the mouth, cold sweat, “butterflies” in the
     stomach, and other physical manifestations. Longtime exposure to these
     symptoms has been associated with cardiac and digestive complications.
        In contrast, positive emotional states, such as compassion, kindness,
     humility, gentleness, and patience, are associated with a sense of well-
     being, a positive outlook, and an optimal relationship with others and
     with God. Positive psychology, a newly developed and widely accepted
     branch of psychology, aims at the promotion of positive emotions in
     order to obtain happiness and to prevent mental illness. In fact, there is
     evidence that harboring certain negative emotions will adversely affect
     health and longevity; in contrast, the promotion of a positive outlook
     can promote health and longevity. In other words, the more positive
     your outlook and emotions, the better overall health you can enjoy.

Read Galatians 5:22. How should the fruit of the Spirit make a dif-
     ference in the way people experience life?

Read Colossians 3:12–14. What is the most outstanding positive emo-
     tion according to Paul? What is the meaning of “clothe yourselves”
     (NIV) as expressed in this passage? What consequences follow
     when someone puts into practice Paul’s words in this passage?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Though love is more than an emotion, it is still the supreme emo-
     tion. God is love, and it is His plan for His children to experience
     love for others and from others; He wants us to know what it means
     to love God and to be loved by Him. Love brings about an array of
     other positive feelings and emotions that can be translated into highly
     desirable behaviors.

      What has been your own experience with how your emotional
      state impacts your actions? Why is it wise not to make important
      decisions amid a flurry of emotions, be they positive or negative?

     Jesus’ Emotional Manifestations: Part 1
       In Mark 8:1–3, “compassion” was the motivator that led Jesus to
     devise a plan for feeding the multitude. Nobody else had thought of
     the practical needs of these people, who had eaten little or nothing in
     three days. Jesus observed that some had traveled far; thus, He knew
     that they could collapse if sent home without anything to eat.

Apart from taking care of nourishing the crowds, what other acts of
     Jesus were performed out of compassion? Mark 1:40, 41; 6:34.

       Lepers often were treated with disdain. There was no other illness
     or condition that would produce more terror and pity than would
     leprosy. Individuals with this visible malady were banned from any
     social interaction and often were forced to live in a designated camp.
     Whenever others came near, they were obligated to shout “Unclean!
     Unclean!” in order to warn people to move away and avoid infection.
     Because Jesus felt compassion for this man, He cured him instantly
     and then sent him away with instructions not to tell anyone. But the
     cured man could not keep this wonderful act of love to himself, and
     he started to share it with everyone.
       Jesus felt compassion, not only when people lacked the basic
     physical necessities but also when they were without leadership,
     direction, or aims. Thus, before providing food for them, He felt
     their deep spiritual needs and proceeded to teach them about the
     kingdom of God.
       Christ’s compassion can be seen, too, in Mark 9:36, where Jesus
     emphasized physical touch. He held children and showed love and
     affection for them. He also reached out and touched diseased people
     in order to communicate divine healing power.
       In the encounter with the rich young ruler (Mark 10:21, 22), Jesus
     loved him even though the young man did not follow the Master’s
     directions. In an instant, both men experienced strong emotions—love
     (Jesus) and sadness (the rich young ruler).

      What are ways that you express compassion? That is, it’s one thing
      to feel compassion (most people do that), but it’s another to express
      it by concrete deeds. How might you through words and deeds bet-
      ter reveal the compassion you feel for those who are hurting?

      Jesus’ Emotional Manifestations: Part 2
        Read Luke 19:41–44. What led Jesus to shed tears over Jerusalem?
      No doubt it was over the sorrow He felt as He looked into the future
      and viewed Jerusalem’s fate. But even more so, He felt sorrow for the
      many city dwellers who had rejected Him. “The tears of Jesus upon
      the mount, when he overlooked the city of his love and care, while
      in the midst of the rejoicing and hosannas of thousands, were the last
      pleadings of rejected love and compassion.”—Ellen G. White, The
      Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3, p. 20.
        The Gospel writers record two occasions on which Jesus wept.
      People usually cry for themselves, but on these occasions Jesus’ sor-
      row came from a deep feeling for others.

What were some of the painful emotions Jesus experienced in the fol-
      lowing contexts? Matt. 26:37, 38; Mark 3:5; 8:12; John 11:32–38;
      Mark 11:15, 16. What caused the emotions He experienced?

      ________________________________________________________

         The first few verses of Isaiah 53 confirm that Jesus was a man of
      sorrows. Even though He experienced many moments of joy, He also
      felt severe emotional pain. Much of Jesus’ suffering had to do with
      feelings of frustration when His followers did not grasp His message.
      In spite of the abounding love of Jesus and His supernatural signs,
      many did not understand that Jesus was the Messiah. Jesus also suf-
      fered greatly as He observed the results of sin upon humankind.
         The events around Lazarus’ death caused Him great sorrow too.
      John tells us that Jesus groaned in the spirit (John 11:33). This is a
      translation of the Greek word that indicates a very strong display of
      emotional turmoil, accompanied by an audible sound from the throat
      and nose. Greek playwright Aeschylus (525–456 b.c.) uses the same
      word to describe the snorting of horses. The word is used five times in
      the New Testament, four of them to describe Jesus’ emotion.

       Contemplating the emotional experiences of Jesus can help us
       understand how much He can relate to our own emotional tur-
       moil. Look at this text: “For we do not have a high priest who
       is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses” (Heb. 4:15, NIV).
       How can the message of this text bring us into a closer bond
       with Jesus, especially in times of suffering?

     God’s Plan for Painful Emotions
Read John 16:20–24. What is Jesus’ promise in regard to pain and
     grief?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       The passage offers great hope to anyone going through physical or
     psychological pain. Here are a few things that can be learned from
     this text:

       • The world seems to be full of joy. Often the believer looks around
     and is reminded of the unfairness of life. Wicked people seem to
     enjoy themselves, while many committed to God are in pain. But
     Jesus assures us that this will not go on forever. Besides, appearances
     often are deceiving. We naturally tend to view others as being happier
     and more successful than we are.

       • Grief, sorrow, and anguish will turn to joy. This is the core of
     Jesus’ promise. Believers must treasure the idea that sorrow will not
     only pass away but give way to joy.

        • Past pain will be forgotten. Memories of the unpleasant past often
     cause much distress. Many psychotherapists work painstakingly to
     remove the effects of the past in their client’s present life. Jesus
     assures us that, just as a woman gives birth and forgets about the pains
     at the sight of the newborn, His followers will one day move beyond
     the pain of the past.

       • No one will take away our joy. The type of joy Jesus offered is not
     the same as we now understand it. Jesus is offering us total happiness,
     an eternal condition that no enemy can take away from the saved.

       • There will be no needs. Jesus affirms that the righteous will no
     longer ask anything. They will not need to make requests and suppli-
     cations to Jesus, because all their needs will have been met.

      How can you hold fast to the promise that your sorrow will
      turn to joy? How can this assurance help you pass through
      the adversities of life? How could you use Jesus’ promises to
      encourage someone in grief?

    Further Study: “As the piercing look of Jesus swept the desecrated
         court of the temple, all eyes were instinctively turned toward him.
         The voices of the people and the noise of the cattle were hushed.
         Priest, ruler, Pharisee and Gentile all looked with mute astonishment
         and indefinable awe upon the Son of God, who stood before them
         with the majesty of Heaven’s King, divinity flashing through human-
         ity and investing him with a dignity and glory he had never before
         displayed. A strange fear fell upon the people. Those nearest Jesus
         instinctively drew as far from him as the crowd would permit. With
         the exception of a few of his disciples the Saviour stood alone. All
         sound was hushed; the deep silence seemed unbearable, and when
1        the firm, compressed lips of Jesus parted, and his voice rang out in
         clarion tones, there was an involuntary groan or sigh of relief from
         all present.
            “He spoke in clear accents and with a power that caused the people
         to sway as if moved by a mighty tempest: ‘It is written, My house
         is the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.’ He
2        descended the steps, and, with greater authority than he had there
         manifested three years before, with indignation that quenched all
         opposition, in tones that rang like a trumpet through the whole temple,
         commanded, ‘Take these things hence.’ ”—Ellen G. White, The Spirit
         of Prophecy, vol. 3, pp. 23, 24.

          1 How would you describe the emotions of Jesus as expressed
          in the above passage? What lessons can we learn from this about
          how many emotions, if properly channeled, can be a source of
          good?

          l
          2 How can negative emotions be compensated with positive
          ones? Consider the experience of Mary Magdalene and the other
          Mary, who went to look at Jesus’ tomb, and were “afraid yet
          filled with joy” (Matt. 28:8, NIV).

          l3 Jewish communities celebrate Purim to remember the time
          that “their sorrow was turned into joy and their mourning into
          a day of celebration” (Esther 9:22, NIV). Discuss with your class
          ways to make sure we do not forget the many times our sorrow
          has turned into joy. Share with the class times you have experi-
          enced this emotional change.

          l
          4 How can we learn to cling to God’s promises when, for now,
          they seem so distant and unattainable?

What is it Worth?
   What is your faith worth? What would you be willing to give up to fol-
low Christ today?
   At a recent evangelistic series held in Kenya, several young people
made decisions for Christ that may cost them everything.
   Dorcas is 19 and recently graduated from high school. She wants to be
a doctor. Her family attends church every Sunday.
   She overheard some young people talking about the evangelistic meet-
ings being held in town. They described the singing and the movies being
shown.
   Dorcas decided to go, even though she had heard that the Seventh-day
Adventist Church, which sponsored the meetings, was a cult. She was
impressed by the young people who talked about health and family life
before each meeting, and the speakers who preached from their open
Bibles, explaining each point carefully. Dorcas sensed that these pastors
were teaching God’s truth, and she wanted to know more about what
Adventists believe.
   At first her parents didn’t mind her attending the meetings. But when
they saw her deepening interest, they became worried and demanded that
she stop attending the meetings. Her mother and other relatives put pres-
sure on Dorcas to stop attending the meetings, and her father told her that
her education was over if she became an Adventist.
   But Dorcas had discovered God’s truth, and she wasn’t willing to give
it up. She was determined to follow God, no matter what the cost. “Truth
is more important to me than a family or an education,” she says. Dorcas
continued studying the Bible and was baptized. Her family has told her to
leave their home, so she is now staying with an Adventist family in town,
where she can continue attending the follow-up meetings.
   “I don’t think I made a mistake,” she says. “I know God has a plan for
my life, and I must be patient and let God work that plan out.”
   Dorcas isn’t alone. Several other young people have made similar deci-
sions. But for some, like Brenda, the story ends differently. She rejoiced
when her parents began attending the meetings, and today that family
looks forward to baptism together.

  In many places faith isn’t free. Please pray for these youth who are
willing to give up so much for God. And thank you for giving your mis-
sion offerings, which help make evangelism, especially in difficult places,
possible.

     Divine Provision for
     Anxiety
       				




     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 3:6–10; 15:1–3; John
     14:1, 2; Matt. 6:25–34; 18:3; Phil. 4:11, 12.
       								

Memory Text: “Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares
     for you” (1 Peter 5:7, NIV).
        				


     S
           cripture is filled with verses containing words such as afraid,
           anxiety, anxious, fret, frightened, and terrified. Many references
           have to do with what people are anxious and fearful about; oth-
     ers with the promises of divine reassurance to those who are fearful or
     anxious. The message “Do not be afraid” runs across Scripture with
     strength and persistence.
        And why not? After all, fear and anxiety have been part of human
     existence since sin entered this earth. Anxiety, or fear about what may
     happen, is one of the most dangerous emotions for mental and physi-
     cal health. A medieval legend tells of the traveler who one night met
     Fear and Plague on their way to London, where they expected to kill
     10,000 people. The traveler asked Plague if he would do all the kill-
     ing. “Oh no,” Plague answered. “I shall kill only a few hundred. My
     friend Fear will kill the rest.”
        This week’s lesson is about how, through divine power, we can
     have some relief from fear and anxiety. Trust in God and contentment
     are key factors in looking at the future with confidence.

     The First Fearful Experience
        Read Genesis 3:6–10. It is difficult to relate to Adam and Eve’s
     first encounter with fear, because none of us can remember the first
     time we experienced this emotion. Developmental psychologists have
     confirmed that infants from early life face definite fears, mostly of
     going hungry and of sharp noises. Growing children and adolescents
     go through a variety of fears, as well: fear of animals, of darkness, of
     being alone; fear of school-related situations, separation from parents,
     fear of not growing up, or of being rejected by peers. Adults also are
     subject to common apprehensions associated with their particular life
     circumstances: fear of not finding a suitable life partner, of not find-
     ing the right job, of terrorist attacks, of contracting a chronic or fatal
     disease, of being assaulted, of dying, etc.
        Ellen G. White says that after Adam ate the forbidden fruit, “the
     thought of his sin filled him with terror” and that the mild tempera-
     ture of Eden chilled the guilty couple. They were left with “a sense
     of sin, a dread of the future, a nakedness of soul.”—Patriarchs and
     Prophets, p. 57.

Consider the following sample of promises against fear and anxi-
     ety. Identify the distinctive component of each of them.

     Ps. 23:4_________________________________________________

     Prov. 1:33_______________________________________________

     Hag. 2:5_________________________________________________

     1 Pet. 3:14_______________________________________________

     1 John 4:18, 19___________________________________________

        Fear and anxiety are very common. They also are frequent, destruc-
     tive, and painful. Common anxiety symptoms include apprehension,
     worry, insomnia, jitters, tension, headaches, fatigue, dizziness, pal-
     pitations, breathlessness, sweating, difficulty in concentrating, and
     hypervigilance. Anxiety also may come with panic attacks. God is
     interested in freeing us from such undesirable experiences and invites
     us to trust in Him.
        							
       What things make you especially afraid, and why? How rational
       is your fear? What practical steps can you take either to remove
       the thing that makes you afraid or to alleviate the fear itself?

     Do Not Be Afraid
Read Genesis 15:1–3. What was Abram’s source of fear? What valid
     reasons did he have to fear?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________
         					
         God called Abram and promised to make him into a great nation.
     Seeing that years passed by and he had no heir, Abram dwelt on this
     issue, and it became his favorite worry. Verses 2 and 3 (NIV) reveal
     the core of Abram’s fear: “ ‘Who will inherit my estate? . . . A servant
     in my household will be my heir!’ ” The attitude seems a generalized
     reaction inherent to human nature, which is to perpetuate something
     of ourselves, something to carry on our influence even after we die.
         God’s response to Abram’s concerns was, “ ‘Do not be afraid.
     . . . I am your shield, your very great reward’ ” (Gen. 15:1, NIV). The
     future of our lives, and our future, even after our death, is in the hands
     of our heavenly Father. He knows that freedom from anxiety is one of
     our greatest needs, and He wants us to be content today and confident
     about tomorrow.

Look up the following texts. What were the circumstances into which
     the Lord’s reassuring message “ ‘Do not be afraid’ ” (NIV) is
     introduced?

       Deut. 31:8_____________________________________________

       2 Chron. 20:17_________________________________________

       Luke 21:9_____________________________________________

       John 14:27_____________________________________________

       Anxiety is manifested through distress about uncertainties. Such
     uncertainties may be near or far in the future, and they may not even
     happen; for the time being, they exist only in the mind. Yet, the symp-
     toms of anxiety are quite real, both emotionally and physically, and
     can be painful. No wonder the Lord wishes to free us from them.

      How can you best use God’s assurance—“Do not fear”—in
      whatever situation you are in? How can you remember that no
      matter what you are facing, God is stronger and bigger than
      that challenge and that He loves you with a love greater than
      the fears you have?

     Trust Against Anxiety
Reflect on the comforting words of Jesus to His disciples in John
     14:1, 2. What happened immediately before? Where does He
     direct their thoughts?


        These loving words encourage trust. Trust in the Father, trust in
     Jesus, because this is a trust that can free the troubled heart from
     gazing at the future in distress. Jesus immediately takes the disciples’
     attention to the kingdom that He is preparing for them. In other words,
     no matter what happens to you here, no matter how bad things are,
     this is what you have waiting for you. Thus, trust in Me and My prom-
     ises. This is what Jesus said to them then and is saying to us now.
        In some counseling sessions clients act out roles relevant to real-life
     situations that lead to increased self-confidence and enhanced self-
     esteem. In addition, they learn how to manage their thoughts when
     anxiety is near, so that the mind may be focused on safe themes.
     They also are taught relaxation and breathing techniques to be used
     in critical situations.
        Although those strategies enjoy a relatively high level of success,
     they focus on gaining trust in oneself in order to reduce the chances of
     feeling anxious. This is acceptable but incomplete, because trust in our-
     selves is but a small step. We need, in the end, to learn to trust in God.

How does the psalmist compare trust in God with trust in humanity?
     Ps. 118:8, 9.


What is Jesus saying to us in Matthew 18:3?


       The first task of infants is to develop trust in their mother or caregiver.
     Once this has been accomplished, little ones will feel content and confi-
     dent about the world and the future that awaits them. This is the begin-
     ning of trust. Jesus asked us to relate to Him as a child relates to his or her
     mother, allowing ourselves to be soothed and comforted by His tender
     care. We, though, have to make a conscious choice to do just that.

      Spend a few moments remembering the times when God has
      answered your prayers or provided the best for you. How can
      previous experiences such as these help you to enhance your
      trust in your heavenly Father today for whatever difficult situa-
      tion you are facing and for whatever is making you feel anxious
      and worried?

                                                                                17

     Of Birds and Lilies
     			
Aside from Jesus’ kind advice to avoid worry, what lessons can
   we obtain from this segment of the Sermon on the Mount? Matt.
   6:25–33.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Through this powerful text Jesus teaches a number of principles
     that, if seriously followed, can protect the believer from much dis-
     tress.
        Keep things in perspective (vs. 25). A hectic schedule may make
     us lose sight of the truly important things. Daily routines may distract
     us from what we believe to be fundamental. God gave us life. God
     created our bodies. If He has the power and the willingness to do
     that, will He not provide food to maintain His creation? Will He not
     arrange for the necessary garments to dress our bodies?
        Become inspired by simple things from nature (vss. 26, 28–30).
     Sparrows and lilies are among the most common things in nature.
     Jesus chose them as a contrast to the immense complexity of human
     beings. It is obvious that sparrows do not worry about tomorrow and
     that lilies do not toil to obtain the latest fashion; yet, they are well
     taken care of. “ ‘Will he not much more clothe you?’ ” (vs. 30, NIV).
        Worry is useless and pointless (vs. 27). Examining problems in
     order to find possible solutions may be productive, but worrying for
     the sake of worrying not only does nothing to solve the issue but
     magnifies the negative side of things.
        Straighten out your priorities (vs. 33). Christians sometimes may
     be caught in the whirl of materialism or other things that can distract
     them from what really matters in life. Thus, Jesus reminds them:
     “ ‘Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these
     things shall be added to you’ ” (NKJV).
        Winston Churchill said: “I remember the story of the old man who
     said on his deathbed that he had a lot of trouble in his life, most of
     which had never happened.”—http://www.saidwhat.co.uk/quotes/
     political/winston_churchill.

      Take a look at the things that worry you, and then kneel down
      and pray, asking God to take charge of all your worries. What
      are the concerns that you can have a part in fixing? What things
      are absolutely beyond your control? Do what you can to fix
      what you can, and then ask the Lord to help you learn to trust
      in Him for the rest.

     One Day at a Time
Read Matthew 6:34. What is Jesus telling us here? How can we learn
     to do what He says? Why is it so important?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Putting into practice the message of Matthew 6:34 would bring so
     much peace to people today. Jesus is not asking us to ignore planning
     or to be careless. He simply is telling us not to worry about what
     may happen, not to use the typical “What if” thoughts: “What if I get
     sick?” “What if I lose my job?” “What if I have an accident?” “What
     if my child dies?” “What if someone attacks me?”
        The following list shows the various things that make up an average
     person’s anxiety. Anxious individuals focus on:
        1. Fifty percent of events that will never happen
        2. Twenty-five percent of occurrences of the past that cannot be
           changed
        3. Ten percent about unconfirmed criticism by others
        4. Ten percent about health (much of it apprehensive)
        5. Five percent about real problems that will be faced

How can you gain inspiration from Paul’s experience of content-
     ment? Phil. 4:11, 12.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       One of the keys for living one day at a time is contentment, an
     effective antidote for worry. Contentment is not an inheritable atti-
     tude but an acquired characteristic. Paul said that “I have learned the
     secret of being content in any and every situation” (vs. 12, NIV). In
     this day and age, in which we face so many problems, there is a need
     to develop a sense of contentment for what we presently have and not
     to worry about what might come tomorrow.

      Jesus said: “ ‘Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I
      do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be
      troubled and do not be afraid’ ” (John 14:27, NIV). In practical
      terms, how do you benefit from Jesus’ assurance of peace of
      mind? Share your answer in class on Sabbath. What can you
      learn from each other?

    Further Study: “It is not work that kills; it is worry. The only way
          to avoid worry is to take every trouble to Christ. Let us not look on the
          dark side. Let us cultivate cheerfulness of spirit.”—Ellen G. White,
          Mind, Character, and Personality, p. 466.
             “If we educated our souls to have more faith, more love, greater
          patience, a more perfect trust in our heavenly Father, we would have
          more peace and happiness as we pass through the conflicts of this life.
          The Lord is not pleased to have us fret and worry ourselves out of the
          arms of Jesus. He is the only source of every grace, the fulfillment of
          every promise, the realization of every blessing. . . . Our pilgrimage
1
          would indeed be lonely were it not for Jesus. ‘I will not leave you
          comfortless’ (John 14:18), He says to us. Let us cherish His words,
          believe His promises, repeat them by day and meditate upon them in
          the night season, and be happy.”—Ellen G. White, Mind, Character,
          and Personality, p. 468.

    Discussion Questions:
           l
           1 As a class, go over your answer to Thursday’s final question.


           l
           2 Some, without any real immediate reason for concern, are
           afraid to suffer and die; others actually are experiencing a
           debilitating or terminal disease that will likely kill them. Others
           perhaps truly are facing another life-threatening situation. How
3          can people in those circumstances be comforted?

           l3 Jacob showed “great fear and distress” (Gen. 32:7, NIV) in
           preparing to meet Esau. Joseph’s brothers were “terrified”
           (Gen. 45:3, NIV) when Joseph revealed his true identity. Discuss
           acceptable ways to deal with fears that come from our own
           wrongdoing. Is there a difference in dealing with fears that we
           have brought upon ourselves through our own wrong actions? If
           so, what is the difference?

           l
           4 Job affirmed: “What I feared has come upon me; what I
           dreaded has happened to me” (Job 3:25, NIV). Can our fears
           become real by the “self-fulfilling prophecy” effect? In other
           words, can a constant worry about something happening actu-
           ally help bring about the thing feared? Discuss.

           l
           5 Think about all the things you have worried about that never
           came to pass. What lessons can you learn from these experiences
           that should, ideally, help you worry less about the future now?

A Simple Invitation
by Nedyalka Angelova
  Nedy listened patiently as her neighbor talked about a Bible study class
she attended. Nedy is a science teacher in Bulgaria. She had tried several
times to read the Bible, but even though she had a keen analytical mind,
she couldn’t understand it. So when her friend invited her to attend the
Bible study class, she accepted. “I wanted to broaden my knowledge,” she
said. “I wasn’t looking for God.”
  Nedy went to the Bible class prepared to take notes. But as the speaker
lectured, she was struck by the profound lessons this man drew from the
Bible. She continued attending the class and soaked up God’s love. She
told her husband, Nikolai, a retired military officer, what she was learning.
But he responded, “You may go if you want, but don’t bother me with
religion.”
  Nedy knew that Nikolai wanted nothing to do with religion, but she
continued to share with him what she was learning. Nedy’s interest in the
Bible grew, and she accepted her friend’s invitation to attend the Sabbath
worship services.
  When the church organized a health expo, Nedy invited Nikolai to go
with her, but he made no promises. So she was surprised to see him there.
She learned that a friend also had invited him to attend, and he had agreed
to go. The expo and the church members who sponsored it impressed
Nikolai, and the following week he surprised Nedy by saying, “I want to
go to church with you this week.”
  Nikolai stopped drinking and smoking and started attending church reg-
ularly. As their faith in God grew, they decided to be baptized together. “I
never dreamed that a simple invitation to a Bible study class would change
our lives so completely,” Nedy says. “We’re so much happier now than
                             we were before we met Christ. I thank God for
                             the faithful Adventists who invited us and who
                             introduced us to God.”

                                 Our mission offerings help fund health
                               expos and many other outreach programs
                               that reach people for Christ around the world.
                               Thank you for giving.

     Stress
							


			



     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: 1 Kings 17:2–4, 15, 16;
     19:1, 2; Mark 6:31–34; Gal. 6:2; John 15:13.

Memory Text: “ ‘Come to me, all you who are weary and bur-
     dened, and I will give you rest’ ” (Matthew 11:28, NIV).		



     S
            tress touches everyone. Demands at work, family crises, guilt,
            uncertainty about the future, dissatisfaction with the past—these
            all are hard enough. All this, along with the general events of
     life, can put enough pressure on people that it affects their physical and
     mental health. Researchers Thomas H. Holmes and Richard H. Rahe
     developed the social readjustment rating scale, which lists life events
     with corresponding stress values for each: the death of spouse—100;
     personal injury or illness—53; change in residence—20; etc. A person
     accumulating 200 or more points at any given time runs a 50 percent
     chance of becoming ill; someone accruing 300 or more will reach a
     point of crisis. Moderate amounts of stress are necessary to increase
     performance, but beyond a point, stress becomes a health hazard.
        Jesus shows by precept and example that seeking God at a quiet
     time and place is the best remedy for life’s stresses (Mark 6:31). If we
     will allow Him to, the Lord will help us deal with the pressures that
     are such an inevitable part of life here.

     Exciting Life Events
How did God provide for Elijah’s survival during the long drought
     in Israel? 1 Kings 17:2–6, 15, 16.

     ________________________________________________________

       In the midst of a long famine, Elijah must have felt very close to
     the Lord, who took such personal care of him. First, he had the oppor-
     tunity to witness ravens (normally nasty birds) come twice a day to
     feed him. Talk about a miracle! Then he saw endless rations of bread
     coming from a little oil and meal—enough food to feed three persons
     for two years. How much more evidence of God’s providential care
     would anyone need?
       Ellen G. White applied the lessons of this story to God’s faithful
     people in the last days: “I saw that our bread and water will be sure at
     that time, and that we shall not lack or suffer hunger; for God is able
     to spread a table for us in the wilderness. If necessary He would send
     ravens to feed us, as He did to feed Elijah.”—Early Writings, p. 56.

What were some of the other things that happened to Elijah, and
     what lessons can we draw from them for ourselves? 1 Kings
     17:17–22; 18:23–39, 45.

     ________________________________________________________

        God used Elijah to resurrect the widow’s son. What a test of
     faith, and what a vindication of God’s power over life and death!
     Next, the test at Mount Carmel was an irrefutable and spectacular
     demonstration of God’s power. Finally, heavy rain after a three-
     year drought was another manifestation of God’s involvement in
     human affairs. Elijah’s life was full of direct and divine interven-
     tion. It’s hard to imagine how anyone, after all that, could not fully
     trust in the Lord; yet, not long after all that, Elijah was swept up
     in the symptoms of stress and discouragement (see tomorrow’s
     lesson).
        Thus, there’s an important lesson here. Regardless of the miracles
     in our lives, we always will face obstacles. No one, not even a prophet
     like Elijah, is immune to the troubles that life brings.

      Are success and achievement bringing you stress? A long series
      of exhilarating events (even positive ones) may add much
      weight to your load. At the same time, why must we be careful
      not to be too self-satisfied during good times?

      Bitter Life Events
        Read 1 Kings 18:40. Whether or not Elijah took part himself
      in the killing of hundreds of people, he was clearly in charge of
      the operation, and that must have been an emotionally devastat-
      ing experience. This act was permitted by God as the only way
      to eradicate the idolatry, which included the sacrifice of children
      (Jer. 19:5). Nevertheless, it surely must have taken an emotional
      toll on the prophet.

On top of the stress of that ordeal, what else did Elijah face? 1 Kings
      19:1, 2.

      ________________________________________________________
        							
        From the beginning of Ahab’s reign, the wicked queen had been ada-
      mant that her husband should “serve Baal and worship him” (1 Kings
      16:31, NIV). As a result, all of Israel had fallen into idolatrous practices.
      Jezebel was instrumental in restoring the worship of Ashtoreth, one of
      the vilest and most degrading forms of Canaanite idolatry. Now, with
      the death of all the priests, Jezebel felt impatient and enraged.

How did Elijah react to the message brought from Jezebel? 1 Kings
      19:3, 4.

      ________________________________________________________

        How could this man of God, after having witnessed a series of won-
      derful miracles, be in such a state of despair? How did he reach the
      point of asking God to take his life? After all, look at the miracles he
      had seen and even had been involved in!
        “Satan has taken advantage of the weakness of humanity. And
      he will still work in the same way. Whenever one is encompassed
      with clouds, perplexed by circumstances, or afflicted by poverty or
      distress, Satan is at hand to tempt and annoy. He attacks our weak
      points of character. He seeks to shake our confidence in God, who
      suffers such a condition of things to exist.”—Ellen G. White, The
      Desire of Ages, p. 120.

       How often have you done the same thing: forgetting the
       incredible way the Lord has worked for you in the past?
       Why is it so important, especially during times of despair and
       stress, to cling to the memories of how God has worked in your
       life in the past? Why do we so easily forget what the Lord has
       done for us? How can praise and worship help you through
       difficult times?

     God’s Therapy						
Read 1 Kings 19:5–9. What were the simple remedies provided for
     Elijah during this stressful time in his life? What can we take from
     this for ourselves? How are our physical actions impacting, either
     for good or for bad, our mental attitude?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Sleep. Eat. Sleep again. Eat again. And then engage in intense
     physical exercise—forty days and forty nights; from Mount Carmel
     to Mount Horeb. How interesting that proper sleep, exercise, and a
     healthy diet often are prescribed to combat psychological stress.
        A common treatment for mood disorders is called activity schedul-
     ing. It consists of developing a rigid timetable that contains pleas-
     ant and purposeful activities that will force a depressed person to
     organize, anticipate, and carry out events. Such a regimen helps the
     person fill time positively and avoid self-pity. Physical exercise often
     is included in the activities, because it helps produce endorphins,
     morphine-like natural chemicals that enhance mood and temporarily
     relieve depression.
        With heavenly guidance Elijah was led into the steps that would
     restore his normal mental health. As with Elijah, we need to be open
     to divine leading. As soon as Elijah sat down under the broom tree, he
     prayed. Yes, it was the wrong kind of prayer (asking God to take his
     life), but at least it was a prayer, a desire for God to take charge.
        Over time Elijah overcame his terrible discouragement, and God
     still was able to use him (see 1 Kings 19:15, 16; 2 Kings 2:7–11).
     Before being taken up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah was given
     the great privilege of anointing his successor, and of witnessing the
     separation of the waters of the Jordan River, thus permitting him and
     Elisha to cross the river on dry ground.
        Finally, Elijah was taken to heaven, without ever having to die
     himself. Kind of an ironic “end” for a man who, not too much earlier,
     was asking God to take his life!

      What are we missing out on if we pray only in times of discour-
      agement and despair? Contrast the benefits of a life of constant
      prayer as opposed to prayer only in emergency situations. How
      can you learn to live more consistently in an attitude of constant
      prayer?

                                                                         25

      Jesus’ Method to Manage Stress
         With the blossoming of cell phones in the mid-1990s, a veteran
      Adventist minister said, “I will never have one! As I visit churches
      and listen to people’s problems, I get weary and distressed. But when I
      return to my car, I find refuge. If I had a cell phone, I wouldn’t find rest
      even in my car.” Every follower of Christ needs a quiet hiding place to
      find calm, to pray, and to listen to God through His Written Word.

Read Mark 6:31. What lesson can we take from this for ourselves? How
      often do you do this for yourself, or do you always have an excuse?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Speaking of Jesus, Ellen G. White wrote: “His hours of happiness
      were found when alone with nature and with God. Whenever it was
      His privilege, He turned aside from the scene of His labor, to go into
      the fields, to meditate in the green valleys, to hold communion with
      God on the mountainside or amid the trees of the forest. The early
      morning often found Him in some secluded place, meditating, search-
      ing the Scriptures, or in prayer. From these quiet hours He would
      return to His home to take up His duties again, and to give an example
      of patient toil.”—The Desire of Ages, p. 90.

What other sanctuary did Jesus have? Matt. 21:17, Mark 11:11.
      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         People may be a source either of distress or of peace. Jesus found
      peace with friends who brought comfort and affection to His life. This
      He found at the house of Lazarus, Martha, and Mary. “His heart was
      knit by a strong bond of affection to the family at Bethany. . . . Often,
      when weary, thirsting for human fellowship, He had been glad to
      escape to this peaceful household. . . . Our Saviour appreciated a quiet
      home and interested listeners. He longed for human tenderness, cour-
      tesy, and affection.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 524.
         			
       How can you apply Jesus’ stress management method to your
       life? What advice would you give to a city dweller who needs to
       travel for hours to find nature? Or to someone who lives in an
       extended family with a large number of people under the same
       roof? Whom would you go to, among your family/friends, if you
       found yourself disoriented and in need of emotional support?

      Bringing Relief to Others
What are the specific features about Jesus’ behavior that Peter used
      to describe his Master? Acts 10:38.
      ________________________________________________________
      ________________________________________________________

         Jesus’ style was fundamentally selfless. He utilized all His energy
      to serve others, to bring them relief through His kind words and heal-
      ing power. Jesus never used His divine powers to benefit Himself.
      This must have made such an impression on Peter that his description
      of the Savior was of someone who “ ‘went around doing good and
      healing all who were under the power of the devil’ ” (vs. 38, NIV).
         In the majority of cases, the pressure brought about by work, rela-
      tionships, money, etc., is self-centered. Focusing on others (rather than
      on oneself) is a good way to remove personal pressure. People who
      engage in voluntary work, community projects, etc., report greater
      feelings of well-being and satisfaction than people who do not.

Read Galatians 6:2, Philippians 2:4, and John 15:13. What message
      is in there for us?
         					
      ________________________________________________________
      ________________________________________________________

         John D. Rockefeller (1839–1937) provided an example of how to
      survive stress by moving the focus from oneself to others. By 1879
      his company, Standard Oil, handled about 90 percent of the refining in
      the United States. By the age of 50, he was the richest man alive. But
      in 1891, he had a nervous breakdown and was near death. However,
      he recovered from his illness in just a few months.
         How?
         Apart from a simple diet, rest, and exercise, he decided to give
      away his fortune and spent the remaining 40 years of his life as a
      philanthropist. Early in the twentieth century, his personal fortune
      peaked at nearly $900 million. At the time of his death, his estate was
      valued at $26 million. His donations did a lot of good in the world.
      And as for himself, he extended his life by nearly another fifty years,
      living in contentment to the age of 97.

       What has been your own experience with the blessings that
       come from serving others? Why not make a concentrated and
       prayerful effort to do more?

    Further Study: “Utterly wearied, he [Elijah] sat down to rest under
         a juniper tree. And sitting there, he requested for himself that he
         might die. . . . A fugitive, far from the dwelling places of men, his
         spirits crushed by bitter disappointment, he desired never again to
         look upon the face of man. . . . Into the experience of all there come
         times of keen disappointment and utter discouragement—days when
         sorrow is the portion, and it is hard to believe that God is still the kind
         benefactor of His earthborn children; days when troubles harass the
         soul, till death seems preferable to life. It is then that many lose their
         hold on God and are brought into the slavery of doubt, the bondage
1        of unbelief. Could we at such times discern with spiritual insight the
         meaning of God’s providences we should see angels seeking to save
         us from ourselves, striving to plant our feet upon a foundation more
         firm than the everlasting hills, and new faith, new life, would spring
         into being.”—Ellen G. White, Prophets and Kings, p. 162.

2   Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Have you ever had times during which you clearly saw the
          hand of God working in your life, and your faith was strong,
          only to sink low right after and find yourself filled with doubts
          about God and His leading in your life? What have you learned
          from that kind of experience that could help others who might
          be facing the same thing?
3         l
          2 What is it about helping others that makes us feel better?
          Why is that so often the case? At the same time, why is it so hard
          to give of ourselves to others? How can we learn to be more will-
          ing to die to self in order to serve the needs of those around us
          better?

          l
          3 Take a good look at your own health habits. What are you
          eating and drinking? What kind of exercise program are you
          on? How much leisure time do you have? What changes can
          you make that could help you feel better emotionally, as well
          as physically? Though in some cases, people have very serious
          psychological needs that must be professionally addressed, many
          times a change in lifestyle habits can make a big difference in
          how we feel.		

          l4 How much “spare” time do you have? What do you do with
          that time? How could you better utilize that time to enhance
          your relationship with God?

The Prodigal
by Alberto Villanueva
   As a youth growing up in Mexico, I found no reason to live. I was
deeply into alcoholism and was having problems with my family.
   Then I met a Seventh-day Adventist man who gave me an old, well-
marked Bible. I read the Bible, especially the marked verses, and was
amazed that God’s Word was so alive, so vital! I began attending church
with the man and continued reading the Bible. God rescued me from my
hopeless life and gave me a ministry to help people who are living as I
once lived.
   I met a family who was distant relatives of my wife. The husband and
I became friends, but when I asked him for permission to study the Bible
with his family, he said no, explaining that they were members of another
faith. As we talked, I prayed that God would open this man’s heart. As
I prepared to leave, he said, “Come back soon and share the Bible with
us!”
   When I returned to study with this family, Jorge, one of the sons,
stomped angrily from the room. Whenever I went to visit the family, Jorge
would leave the room. But we continued studying together, and the fam-
ily members accepted the Bible truths they discovered. Then one evening
Jorge joined the Bible studies. And when seven members of the family
asked to join the church, Jorge was among them. Only later did I learn
that Jorge had been so angry about the Bible studies that he had plotted
to kill me.
   I shared the gospel with people in a mountain village some distance
from my home. One day I noticed that some men were following me to
the home of an interested family. The man I was visiting saw the men and
warned me to be careful, that these men were dangerous.
   Then he told the men who had followed me, “Leave him alone. He’s
a missionary who has come to share God’s love with us.” The thieves
didn’t bother me again. Eventually, seven people in this village joined
God’s church.
   I love sharing the gospel with others as someone shared it with me. I
praise God that He has led me to some 50 people who have committed
their hearts to Christ.

  Please pray for those who still live without hope. And remember that
your mission offerings help make a difference in the lives of those who
need to know about God’s love.

Alberto Villanueva shares his faith in Morelos, Mexico.

     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: 1 Samuel 25; Eph. 4:1–3;
     1 Pet. 3:9–12; Luke 17:3, 4; 23:34; James 5:16.

     A
             n experienced urban evangelist used to organize stress man-
             agement seminars as an introduction to evangelistic meetings
             in cities. He had devised a simple survey in which he asked
     the audience to list four or five things that caused them the most
     stress. Workers grouped the answers in general categories (health,
     money, work, relationships, etc.). Before the count was completed,
     one worker saw that the speaker already had a prepared set of trans-
     parencies to discuss “relationships” as the number one source. When
     questioned, the pastor explained that the results had always been
     the same: bad relationships always came up as the primary cause of
     stress.
        Whether problems with spouse, children, boss, work associate,
     neighbor, friend, or enemy, people tend to be the principal stressor. In
     contrast, when relationships are positive, they are a powerful source
     of satisfaction. This seems consistent across geography and culture.
     People make us happy, or people make us miserable.
        That’s why this week we’ll spend some time focusing on the impor-
     tant topic of relationships and what the Bible teaches us about them.

     Completely Humble and Gentle
Read Ephesians 4:1–3. Why do you think Paul connects humil-
     ity, gentleness, and patience with good relationships and unity?
     Recall examples of your own experience in which the above atti-
     tudes have made a positive impact on relationships.

     ________________________________________________________

Read 1 Samuel 25. What can we learn from the actions of Abigail and
     David regarding proper behavior in difficult and tense situations?


       The story of David, Nabal, and Abigail provides an excellent
     example of successful social interaction. Results vary significantly
     depending on how individuals present themselves—as superiors, as
     equals, or as humble friends or associates.
       David sent his soldiers to Nabal with a fair request. “We have pro-
     tected your men and your property; give us whatever you can find”
     (1 Sam. 25:7, 8, author’s paraphrase). But Nabal didn’t know about
     kindness or diplomacy. We are told that he was a harsh and evil man.
     Other translations use terms such as surly, mean, brutish, rough, dis-
     honest, churlish, and rude. And he surely displayed these traits before
     David’s warriors.
       In contrast, notice David’s initial attitude. Even though he held the
     military power, his message was full of care and humility, wishing
     Nabal and his household long life and good health, introducing him-
     self as “your son David” (vs. 8, NIV).
       As for Abigail, the Bible tells us that she was intelligent and beauti-
     ful. Notice her behavior: she provided an abundant amount of choice
     food; she ran to appease David, bowed down before him, addressed
     herself as “your servant” and David as “my master,” and asked for
     forgiveness. She also reminded David that as a man of God, he needed
     to avoid needless bloodshed.
       The result of Abigail’s tactful and humble action brought about a
     complete turn in David’s intentions. He praised the Lord for sending
     her and praised her for her good judgment. This effective mediation,
     full of godly spirit, saved the lives of many innocent men. As for
     Nabal, David did not need to shed blood, because the man died—
     probably of heart failure—a victim of his own fear.

      It’s easy (usually) to be kind to those we like. But what about those
      we don’t? Think of those you find very disagreeable. How would
      they react if you displayed a humble and gentle attitude toward
      them? Through God’s grace, give it a try (remembering, too, that
      you might not always be the most likable and lovable soul either).
                                                                           31

     Repaying Evil With Blessings
What is the true intent of 1 Peter 3:8–12? What are some of the
     immediate ways you can apply these principles to your own life?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Jesus upgraded the “eye for an eye” approach to turning the other
     cheek (Matt. 5:38, 39). This was a revolutionary concept then and still
     is today for many cultures and traditions. Unfortunately, even Christians
     rarely return good for evil. But Jesus keeps saying: “ ‘Learn from me,
     for I am gentle and humble in heart’ ” (Matt. 11:29, NIV).
        A couple with small children was experiencing serious problems with
     their neighbors. On several occasions, and in nasty tones, these neighbors
     told the young parents how disagreeable it was to see play equipment
     installed in the yard and to hear the children playing on it. They com-
     plained about certain sections of the young family’s yard and how they
     were bothered by this and that. The young couple did not appreciate being
     talked to in such a harsh and unkind tone. After all, they were not doing
     anything against the neighborhood rules. One day, when the family was
     harvesting apples from the backyard apple trees, the mother decided to
     give the neighbors two freshly baked apple pies. The neighbors accepted
     the pies gladly. That simple act made a difference in their relationship,
     probably because they never would have expected anything like that from
     people whom they had been constantly harassing.

How did David pay back Saul’s constant attacks on his life? 1 Sam.
     24:4–6. What does this tell us about David’s character? How
     might we need to apply the same attitude in our own experience,
     especially when we might be having problems with someone who,
     in his or her own way, also could be “anointed of the Lord”?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       First Samuel records four times when David expressed the immo-
     rality of lifting his hand against “the Lord’s anointed.” Even though
     he had opportunities to take revenge, he repeatedly tried to approach
     and forgive the king. David chose a humble and godly manner in his
     dealings with someone who wasn’t kind to him.
       Shouldn’t we all, in whatever situation we are facing, seek to do

     Forgiveness
       It is possible to appear to live a rich and meaningful religious life,
     yet have serious relational problems. It’s a fact of life that as human
     beings we often cross each other and cause each other pain, even—
     and sometimes especially—in the church. Hence, how important we
     learn the art of forgiveness.

Read Ephesians 4:32. How well have you been applying this biblical
     truth in your life? Whom do you need to forgive, and why is it
     important for your own good to forgive them?

     ________________________________________________________

        Only in recent years has the counseling profession started to look
     more positively at the importance of spiritual principles for mental
     health. For decades religion and spirituality were seen by many psy-
     chologists and counselors as an underlying source of guilt and fear.
     Not so much anymore. Today many utilize the protective effects of a
     committed Christian viewpoint. “Therapies” such as prayer, spiritual
     journaling, memorization of key biblical texts, and forgiveness proto-
     cols are now recognized as helping many people overcome a variety of
     emotional disturbances. Forgiveness counts among the most soothing
     strategies, even if the ability to truly forgive and be forgiven comes
     only from God through a God-transformed heart (Ezek. 36:26).

Read Matthew 5:23–25; Luke 17:3, 4; 23:34. What do they teach us
     about forgiveness, as well?			

     ________________________________________________________

       Sometimes one may think that forgiveness virtually is impossible
     to grant. But no human being will ever reach the extent of what Jesus
     bore in the way of pain and humiliation: the King and Creator of the
     universe was unjustly degraded and crucified by His creatures. Yet
     Jesus, in complete humility, cared for them enough to implore the
     Father for their forgiveness.

      At times people wrong others without a full understanding of
      the pain they are causing. Other times people offend because
      they are insecure or have personal problems, and so they try to
      obtain relief by hurting others. How can the awareness of oth-
      ers’ problems help you offer forgiveness? How can you learn to
      forgive those who are purposely trying to hurt you?

     Confess Your Sins to Each Other
How do you interpret James’s recommendation to confess sins to one
     another? James 5:16. Dwell on this verse and ask yourself how
     you need to apply its teaching to your own situation.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       Sins against my neighbor require my confession to him or her in
     order to secure forgiveness and to restore the relationship. It also
     shows that I am willing to take the responsibility for what I have done
     and that I trust and hope for acceptance and forgiveness. By God’s
     grace, a noble soul will grant forgiveness, regardless of the size of
     the offense.
       There is an additional interpretation of James’s text, which offers
     great healing possibilities. Confessing sins, errors, and transgressions
     to someone you trust brings about emotional healing. Opening up
     one’s own imperfection to a godly Christian friend will help alleviate
     the burden of sin. In addition, mutual confession deepens interper-
     sonal relationships. Trusting and being trusted provide the bonding
     that will make a friendship genuine and lasting.
       In fact, the entire counseling profession is founded upon the prin-
     ciple that talking is good for the soul. Although there are mental disor-
     ders that necessitate professional treatment, many feelings of distress
     can be relieved at the church and community levels. And this is espe-
     cially true for problems created by the deterioration of interpersonal
     relationships—misunderstandings, slander, jealousy, etc. Following
     James’s advice not only will alleviate psychological burden but also
     bring renewed strength to change destructive behaviors.
       A word of caution though. Although disclosure of committed sins
     to a close friend may bring much relief, it makes the person vulner-
     able. There is always the risk that our friend will reveal the confidence
     to others, and this is destructive to those involved.
       Most important, we always can confess our trespasses to the Lord
     in full confidence and with the assured certainty of forgiveness. Read
     1 Peter 5:7. Defective relationships may bring uncertainty and even
     fear and anxiety. Others may be able to help, but the surest aid comes
     from God, who is willing to take all our cares at any time, leaving
     us with a genuine sense of relief for having left our burdens in His
     hands.

     Building Others Up
Read the following texts, and ask yourself how you can apply the
     teaching to your own life. Why is this so important, not only for
     yourself but for others? Eph. 4:29, 1 Thess. 5:11, Rom. 14:19.

     ________________________________________________________

        Paul admonishes the early church communities to avoid the dete-
     rioration of personal relationships in the “body of Christ.” Many
     interpersonal difficulties come from tearing each other down and,
     in the process, hurting the entire community. People who engage in
     gossip and backbiting tend to have problems themselves—feelings of
     inferiority, the need to be noticed, a desire for control or power, and
     other insecurities. These people need help to abandon this hurtful way
     of dealing with their inner conflicts.
        Indeed, feeling well about oneself helps to prevent being involved in
     gossip and slander. Members of the body of Christ need to consider them-
     selves privileged for having received the gift of salvation (Ps. 17:8, 1 Pet.
     2:9). With this understanding, the emphasis becomes building others up
     and working toward mutual edification. Words of encouragement and
     approval, emphasis on the positive side of things, humility, and a joyful
     attitude are ways of supporting those with personal problems.
        Another way to help is to serve as relational mediators. Jesus calls
     peacemakers “ ‘blessed’ ” and “ ‘children of God’ ” (Matt. 5:9), and
     James says that peacemakers will reap “a harvest of righteousness”
     (James 3:18, NIV).

Read Matthew 7:12. Why is this so key to all relationships?

     ________________________________________________________

        This principle can be considered as a priceless jewel for social
     relationships. It is positive, it is based on love, it is universal, and it
     stretches above and beyond human law. The “golden rule” also brings
     about practical benefits to everyone involved.
        A Chinese farmer was tending his rice paddy up in the mountain
     terraces overlooking the valley and the sea. One day he saw the begin-
     ning of a tidal wave—the sea retreated, leaving a wide portion of the
     bay exposed, and he knew that the water would return with force,
     destroying everything in the valley. He thought of his friends work-
     ing in the valley and decided to set his rice field on fire. His friends
     immediately ran up the mountain to put the fire out and thus missed
     being killed in the tidal wave. As a result of this spirit of helping one
     another, their lives were saved.
        The lesson is clear.
                                                                              35

    Further Study: Read Ephesians 4:25–32 and underline the words that
         touch your heart more directly. Reflect on all the things you can do,
         with God’s help, to improve your relationship with other people.

           These are portions of a letter that Ellen White wrote in 1908 to an
         evangelist: “I have this message for you from the Lord: Be kind in
         speech, gentle in action. Guard yourself carefully, for you are inclined
         to be severe and dictatorial, and to say rash things. . . . Harsh expres-
         sions grieve the Lord; unwise words do harm. I am charged to say to
         you, Be gentle in your speech; watch well your words; let no harsh-
         ness come into your utterances or into your gestures. . . .
1          “When the daily experience is one of looking unto Jesus and learn-
         ing of Him, you will reveal a wholesome, harmonious character.
         Soften your representations, and let not condemnatory words be
         spoken. Learn of the great Teacher. Words of kindness and sympathy
         will do good as a medicine, and will heal souls that are in despair.
         The knowledge of the Word of God brought into the practical life
2        will have a healing, soothing power. Harshness of speech will never
         bring blessing to yourself or to any other soul.”—Gospel Workers,
         pp. 163, 164.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 How much do you like to gossip? And even if you don’t do
          it yourself, how eager and open are you to hear gossip from
3         others? Why, in a sense, is that just as bad as spreading gossip
          yourself? How can you stop being part of what can cause other
          people a great deal of pain?

          l2 Forgiveness can be so difficult, especially when we have been
          very badly hurt. How do you learn to forgive those who don’t ask
          for forgiveness, who don’t care about your forgiveness, and who
          might even scorn it? What is your responsibility in such cases?

          l
          3 Verbal and physical abuse within families is a reality that
          brings much pain to individuals and groups. What should be the
          Christian attitude to help prevent this problem? What should
          be recommended when forgiveness does not cause any change in
          abusive behavior?

          l
          4 Think over your life right now. What steps can you take to
          bring about an improvement in your relationships? Why are
          humility, trust in God, and a desire to do right so important in
          such a process?

Standing for the Right
by Phyllis Vallieres
   Dorothy had been looking for work for two years, and at times she
struggled to understand why God hadn’t helped her find a job. Then a
Bible text came to mind: “Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline. So
be earnest, and repent” (Rev. 3:19, NIV). Dorothy bowed her head and
asked God to forgive her unbelief.
   She arrived at a job interview and was asked to complete a test in elec-
tronic soldering. She had never soldered anything before, and the supervi-
sor was amazed at her work. “Are you sure you’ve never done this type
of work before?” he asked. Dorothy got the job.
   Dorothy often sang as she worked beside Cindy, her supervisor. “Why
are you so happy?” Cindy asked. When Dorothy said that Jesus is her
personal friend, Cindy said, “I want what you have.”
   Dorothy gave Cindy a Bible. Cindy read it and asked questions about
what she read. Before long Cindy gave her life to Christ.
   Dorothy had been working for the company for several months when a
supervisor announced that workers would have two weeks off with pay at
Christmas, but that they must work four Saturdays to earn the vacation.
Dorothy offered to work on Sundays instead, but the supervisor doubted
whether it could be arranged. Dorothy said, “If God wants me to work
here, He will work this out, but I will not work on His Sabbath.”
   Some coworkers sneered at her for asking for special privileges.
Dorothy prayed, “God please don’t leave me. I need your strength to
stand firm.”
   Her request was granted, and Dorothy went to work on Sundays. There
she met Jean and felt God telling her to talk to her. The two ate together,
and Dorothy said, “God arranged for us to meet today.” Jean agreed, for
she wanted to know more about God. Dorothy arranged for her to study
the Bible with some friends of hers, and soon Jean and her brother and
her boyfriend were studying the Bible together. Several months later Jean
and her boyfriend asked the pastor to marry them, and all three were
baptized.
   “It pays to stand for the right, even when I can’t see where God is lead-
ing,” Dorothy says.

 We can share our faith with others as we give our mission offerings as
well, for those funds help fund outreach programs around the world.

     Guilt



     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 3:8–13; 1 John 1:9;
     Psalm 32; 1 Tim. 4:1, 2; Matt. 26:75; Rom. 8:1.

Memory Text: “If you, O Lord, kept a record of sins, O Lord,
     who could stand? But with you there is forgiveness; therefore you
     are feared” (Psalm 130:3, 4, NIV).



     A
             sense of guilt is one of the most painful and incapacitating
             emotional experiences. It may cause shame, fear, sorrow,
             anger, distress, and even physical illness. Although often
     unpleasant, these feelings can be used by God to lead sinners to repen-
     tance and to the foot of the Cross, where they can find the forgiveness
     they’ve been longing for. Sometimes, however, the guilt mechanism
     makes people feel guilty about something for which they are not
     responsible, as in the case of some accident survivors or children of
     divorce.
       But when the sense of guilt is justified, it serves as a good con-
     science. Guilt produces enough discomfort to make the person do
     something about it. Depending on personal choices, guilt may be
     highly destructive, as in the case of Judas, or highly positive, as in
     the case of Peter.
       This week we will study four biblical accounts of guilt in order to
     understand this process better and to see what we can learn about it.
     We can see how, if properly channeled, guilt can be used by the Lord
     to our advantage. So much depends, really, on our attitude toward the
     guilt we feel and what we choose to do with it.

     Shame
Read Genesis 3:8–13. How did Adam and Eve manifest the guilt they
     experienced? What especially was bad about Adam’s reaction?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Guilt was the first adverse emotion felt by the human race. Soon
     after Adam and Eve sinned, their behavior changed. They “hid from
     the Lord God among the trees of the garden” (vs. 8, NIV). This
     unprecedented reaction indicated fear of their Father and Friend and,
     at the same time, their shame to face Him. Up until their fall, they had
     found joy in God’s presence, but now they hid before His approach-
     ing. A beautiful bond was broken. In addition to fear and shame, they
     felt sorrow, especially as they were made aware of the terrible conse-
     quences of having disobeyed God.
        Notice Adam’s and Eve’s words: “ ‘The woman you put here with
     me . . .’ ” and “ ‘The serpent deceived me . . .’ ” (NIV). Guilt brings
     about a seemingly automatic reaction to place the blame on somebody
     else or to justify one’s own behavior with argumentation. Sigmund
     Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, called this reaction “projection”
     and argued that people project their guilt on others or on circum-
     stances in order to lighten the burden of guilt. This “projection” is
     considered a defense mechanism. But blaming others does not work
     well for interpersonal relationships and poses a barrier to God’s for-
     giveness. The true solution consists of accepting full responsibility for
     one’s own actions and seeking the only One who can provide freedom
     from guilt: “Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who
     are in Christ Jesus” (Rom. 8:1, NIV).
        Sometimes people suffer from guilt for the wrong reasons. Close
     relatives to those who commit suicide, survivors of a massive accident
     or calamity, and children of a recently divorced couple are typical
     examples of what is, in most instances, unfounded guilt. People in
     these situations need to be assured that they cannot be held responsible
     for the behavior of others or for unforeseeable events. And if in certain
     cases they do have some blame, they must take responsibility for their
     actions, seek forgiveness from those whom they have hurt, and then
     hold fast to such Bible promises as: “As far as the east is from the west,
     so far has he removed our transgressions from us” (Ps. 103:12, NIV).

      How do you find yourself reacting to guilt? Are you quick, as
      Adam was, to blame others for your wrong actions? How can
      you learn to face up to the things you have done wrong and
      then, through the grace of God, move on?
                                                                           39

      Joseph’s Brothers’ Distress
What particular remorse-eliciting memory lingered in the minds of
      Joseph’s brothers? Gen. 42:21. What does that tell us about them?
        						
        Guilt is associated with a particular occurrence of the past, some-
      times an image or a brief event that tends to be replayed mentally.
      Other times it takes the form of a flashback image that invades one’s
      mind or appears in dreams or nightmares. The image of the adolescent
      Joseph pleading with his older brothers for his life must have come to
      Jacob’s sons again and again.

How else did guilt affect Joseph’s brothers? Gen. 45:3.

         People affected by guilt think on it repeatedly, lamenting the fact that
      they did what they did, showing fear for the consequence, and entering
      into self-blame. Such rumination produces much distress, frustration,
      and anger at oneself for not having done differently. Unfortunately,
      no matter how much time is devoted to recalling those thoughts, the
      past will remain unchanged. Repentance and forgiveness are required.
      Joseph’s noble character emerges, and he offers forgiveness and encour-
      ages them to stop being angry at themselves. He assures them that the
      occurrence of events had to do with God’s design to save many lives.
      The fact that God was able to use their evil action for good doesn’t,
      however, change the fact that they were guilty of a horrible crime.

How would obeying what’s in these verses help us deal with guilt?
      James 5:16, 1 John 1:9.

        All sins bring pain to the sinner and to God. Many sins also involve
      other people. Each corner of the triangle (God—Others—Me) needs
      to be worked out in order to bring a resolution to past wrongdoings.
      John tells us that God is prepared to forgive and to purify us from
      unrighteousness. In addition, James tells us to confess sins to each
      other; we should do this, especially to those whom we’ve wronged.

       Humble confession is the only way to free oneself from guilt.
       “Your sins may be as mountains before you; but if you humble
       your heart and confess your sins, trusting in the merits of a
       crucified and risen Saviour, He will forgive and will cleanse you
       from all unrighteousness. . . . [The work of His righteousness]
       is peace, and its effect quietness and assurance forever.”—Ellen
       G. White, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 566. What do you need to
       confess in order to experience the promises here?

     Sapped Strength
Read Psalm 32. What does this teach us about guilt and confession?
     What does David mean by “keeping silent”? What happens when
     one remains silent? What was David’s solution to his guilt?

     ________________________________________________________

       Honest confession is good for the soul, and seemingly also for the
     body. David’s language clearly suggests that his mental state of guilt
     was causing physical pain, as well: bones wasted away (vs. 3, NIV)
     and strength sapped (vs. 4, NIV). Health professionals today recognize
     the close link between psychological stress and physical maladies.
     The expression “psychosomatic disease” has been part of the health
     professionals’ language for decades, and it refers to physical symptons
     caused largely by psychological processes. More recently the field of
     psychoneuroimmunology has identified the key role that mental states
     play in protecting our bodies from or exposing them to diseases.
       Guilt, as does any other strong adverse emotion, causes immediate
     deterioration in behavior and can, in the long run, destroy physical
     health. But for those who know the Lord, there is no need of putting
     themselves at risk.
       David’s testimony reveals the antidote for guilt: “Then I acknowledged
     my sin to you. . . . And you forgave the guilt of my sin” (vs. 5, NIV).
       Thus, shame, remorse, sadness, and hopelessness caused by guilt
     can vanish through the Lord’s wonderful forgiveness, and joy and
     happiness can come instead (vs. 11).

Read 1 Timothy 4:1, 2. What does he mean by seared consciences?
     ________________________________________________________

       Paul forewarned Timothy of individuals who would teach strange
     doctrines to believers. They would do this because their consciences
     had been “seared as with a hot iron” (vs. 2, NIV). As fire may burn
     nerve endings and make certain parts of the body insensible, a con-
     science also may become seared by: (a) repeated violation of correct
     principles until no sense of wrongness remains and (b) strong envi-
     ronmental influences that cause one to view something wrong with
     indifference or even as good.

      What things that once bothered you now don’t? If so, might
      that be a seared conscience at work? Try to step back and take
      a good look at things you do that don’t bother your conscience
      but perhaps should.

      Bitter Weeping
One of the greatest manifestations of guilt appears in Matthew 26:75.
      What made Peter’s sense of guilt so great? Have you ever had a
      similar experience? If so, what did you learn from it that could
      help you from making a similar mistake?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        On two occasions Peter stated his intention to be firm and never
      to deny the Master. His second affirmation came even after the Lord
      had predicted that Peter would deny Him three times that very night.
      Hours later two women identified Peter as one of Jesus’ disciples,
      and he denied the Lord each time. Then a group of servants of the
      high priest’s household identified him, and he exclaimed: “ ‘I am
      not’ ” (John 18:25, NIV). Notice that the accusers (minors, females,
      servants) were considered of low social rank in the context. This must
      have added to Peter’s shame and guilt later on.
        The crucial point, however, is that Peter’s weeping led to repen-
      tance, to a change of heart and to a true conversion, no matter how
      painful the process itself. Sometimes that’s what it takes: we need to
      see ourselves as we really are, to see what’s really in our hearts and
      what treachery we are capable of—and then we will fall, broken like
      Peter, before the Lord.
        “With blinding tears he [Peter] makes his way to the solitudes of the
      Garden of Gethsemane and there prostrates himself where he saw his
      Saviour’s prostrate form when the bloody sweat was forced from His
      pores by His great agony. Peter remembers with remorse that he was
      asleep when Jesus prayed during those fearful hours. His proud heart
      breaks, and penitential tears moisten the sods so recently stained with
      the bloody sweat drops of God’s dear Son. He left that garden a con-
      verted man. He was ready then to pity the tempted. He was humbled
      and could sympathize with the weak and erring.”—Ellen G. White,
      Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3, p. 416.
        The first half of the book of Acts provides an unquestionable
      testimony of Peter’s transformation. His preaching and leadership
      and miracle workings were extraordinary and led to the salvation of
      many. His work also led to the foundation of the church as the body
      of Christ. His death, anticipated by Jesus in John 21:18, was received
      as an honor, for he died in the same manner as his Master.

       In what ways have your falls and failures made you more sen-
       sitive to the falls and failures of others? How can you learn to
       minister, out of your pain, to others in theirs?

     Total Forgiveness 				
       “There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in
     Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but accord-
     ing to the Spirit” (Rom. 8:1, NKJV). What does this text promise
     us? How can we make this promise our own?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        God’s forgiveness is so great, so deep, and so wide that it is impos-
     sible to understand fully. Even the best quality of human forgiveness
     cannot compare with that of God. He is so perfect, and we are so
     flawed; and yet, through the provision God Himself provided in Jesus,
     we all can have full and complete pardon the moment we claim the
     promises for ourselves in full faith and surrender to the Lord.

Read the three texts below. How do they shed light to help you
     understand God’s forgiveness?

      Ps. 103:12_______________________________________________

      Isa. 1:18________________________________________________

      Mic. 7:19________________________________________________
      		
        The Bible uses allegories from the concrete and familiar realms in
     order to help us understand the meaning of difficult concepts. As far
     as we can perceive, snow and wool are good examples of whiteness;
     the depths of the sea are among the deepest places we can imagine;
     and nothing can be geographically farther apart than east from west.
     Yet, these are limited allegories of God’s forgiveness.
        In the Abbey of Elstow, a stained-glass window portrays an image
     inspired in Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress. Christian, the central char-
     acter, can be seen kneeling at the foot of the Cross. His heavy burden
     of guilt is rolling away from his shoulders, bringing ineffable relief
     to his soul. Christian says: “I saw it no more.” The burden was gone.
     Its pain, sting, anxiety, and shame disappeared forever. Because of
     our imperfection, selfishness, and defective relationships, it is very
     hard for us to understand the perfect and total forgiveness of God. We
     simply can accept it by faith and pray: “Lord, I humbly confess my
     sins to You and accept Your pardon and cleansing. Amen.”

      How can we be sure our sins are forgiven if we don’t feel that
      they are forgiven? What reasons do we have to believe we’re
      forgiven, despite our feelings?
                                                                          43

    Further Study: “When sin struggles for the mastery in the human
         heart, when guilt seems to oppress the soul and burden the conscience,
         when unbelief clouds the mind, who lets in the beams of light? Whose
         grace is sufficient to subdue sin, and who gives the precious forgive-
         ness and pardons all our sins, expelling the darkness, and making us
         hopeful and joyful in God?—Jesus, the sin-pardoning Saviour. He is
         still our Advocate in the courts of heaven; and those whose lives are
1
         hid with Christ in God must arise and shine, because the glory of the
         Lord has risen upon them.”—Ellen G. White, Bible Training School,
         May 1915. “If you have given offense to your friend or neighbor, you
         are to acknowledge your wrong, and it is his duty freely to forgive
         you. Then you are to seek the forgiveness of God, because the brother
         you have wounded is the property of God, and in injuring him you
2
         have sinned against his Creator.”—Ellen G. White, The Faith I Live
         By, p. 128.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Madame Mao, the wife of the former leader of Communist
          China, Mao Tse-Tung, lived in constant fear and guilt, all because
          of many of the bad things she had done. She was so paranoid,
          in fact, so full of guilt, that any sudden noises, any unexpected
3         sounds, would send her into cold sweats or into a fury. It got so
          bad that she demanded that her staff keep birds away from her
          compound so she didn’t have to hear them singing. Though an
          extreme case, what does this tell us about the power of guilt to
          ruin our lives?

          l
          2 What advice would you give to someone who is struggling
          with guilt over past sins, who claims to have accepted Christ and
          yet still can’t get rid of the feelings of guilt? How can you help
          them?

          l3 In Thursday’s lesson the Bible gave us a number of images to
          describe God’s forgiveness. Have class members come up with
          some of their own metaphors to describe the depth of the forgive-
          ness that is found in Jesus for those who will accept it.

          l
          4 In a world in which no God existed, could guilt exist? Discuss
          your answer.

          l
          5 As we saw this week, God can use guilt to bring us to faith
          and repentance. Are there any other “benefits” to guilt? If so,
          what might they be?

Finding a Spiritual Home
   Jason Feng grew up in the mountains of Taiwan, off the coast of
China. His grandparents were Seventh-day Adventists, but most of
the church’s handful of members were elderly, and Jason didn’t feel
that he belonged. His friends attended the larger Protestant church in
his area, so he joined them. He became a Sunday School teacher and
youth leader.
   When Jason was injured in an accident he spent time at home recov-
ering. He was disappointed that no one from the Protestant church
came to visit him as custom dictated. But the Adventist pastor came,
and he brought Ken, a young ministerial intern. Jason and Ken became
friends.
   Jason’s grandmother noticed Jason’s growing friendship with Ken
and asked the pastor to hold meetings on Friday in her home. She
invited Jason and his family. Out of respect for his grandmother,
Jason attended. Even Jason’s father attended the meetings, although
he didn’t go to church on Sabbath.
   Ken, the young intern, invited Jason to study the Bible with him,
and Jason agreed. Jason’s grandmother’s Bible study grew, and soon
a new congregation of believers formed in the area. Jason joined the
new church and felt spiritually fed. He realized that church wasn’t a
place to just have fun with friends, as he had with his friends in the
Protestant church he had attended. He realized that the church provided
an opportunity to worship God and study deeply into His Word.
   Jason felt a burden to reach out to other young people who had left
the Seventh-day Adventist Church and invite them back. He encour-
ages these youth to become leaders in the church that they had once
left. Several have returned to the church because of his influence.
   Today a new church stands in Jason’s village, and the Adventist
youth join the 30 or so worshipers in a lively service each Sabbath.
During school holidays, the congregation grows as Adventists who
have moved away from the area return to celebrate the holidays with
their families. Jason and several other youth were baptized into the
new Adventist church that has been established in his village. At last
he felt at home.
   “I find such gratitude and satisfaction when I see people accept Jesus
and grow in Christ,” Jason says. “I want to do this till Jesus comes.”


Jason Feng is preparing to become a pastor or Global Mission worker among his indig-
enous group in the mountains of Taiwan.

     Good Thinking




     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Mark 7:21–23, Luke 6:45,
     Acts 14:2, 15:24, Gal. 3:1, Ps. 19:14, Col. 3:1–17.

Memory Text: “Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever
     is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely,
     whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—
     think about such things” (Philippians 4:8, NIV).



     A
             s one of the most utilized forms of mental health intervention
             today, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is based on the
             assumption that most psychological problems are improved
     by identifying and changing inaccurate and dysfunctional perceptions,
     thoughts, and behaviors. People with depression tend to interpret facts
     negatively; people with anxiety tend to look at the future with appre-
     hension; and those with low self-esteem maximize others’ success
     and minimize their own. CBT, therefore, trains people to identify and
     change their unhealthy thinking habits into better alternatives that
     promote desirable behavior and eliminate unwanted ones.
       The Bible teaches us about the connection between thoughts and
     actions (Luke 6:45). Good thought patterns not only are healthy but
     also provide a way toward integrity: “Do not those who plot evil go
     astray? But those who plan what is good find love and faithfulness”
     (Prov. 14:22, NIV).
       This week we’ll look at some biblical truths that can help us gain
     control over our mental activity by allowing Christ to take charge of
     our mind.

     Thoughts: The Root of Behavior
Read Mark 7:21–23 and Luke 6:45. What do these texts tell us about
     the importance of controlling, not just our actions, not just our
     deeds, not just our words but our thoughts, as well?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       People who suffer from impulse-control disorders fail to resist the
     impulse to steal, to attack someone, or to gamble. Mental health clini-
     cians know that these impulses often are preceded by a certain thought
     (or chain of thoughts), which leads to the undesirable behavior.
     Consequently, patients are trained to identify those thought triggers,
     dispel them immediately, and occupy their minds with something
     else. In this way, they gain control of their thoughts and avoid the
     actions that these wrong thoughts so often lead 10.
       Indeed, sinful acts often are preceded by definite thoughts. (Isn’t
     this what temptation is all about?) It is the duty of every Christian
     to learn to identify, with God’s help, the first steps in this process,
     because dwelling on wrong thoughts leads almost inevitably to sin.

What alternative is proposed by Paul to deal with immoral behavior?
     Rom. 8:5–8.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       Mind and behavior are shown by Paul as intimately linked. The
     Spirit-filled mind will seek good deeds, and the sin-dominated mind
     will bring about sinful deeds. It is not enough to change the behavior
     for the sake of convenience or to present a righteous face to the world.
     The heart (mind) needs to be transformed or else the eventual fruits
     will show the true nature of that heart.
       “We need a constant sense of the ennobling power of pure thoughts
     and the damaging influence of evil thoughts. Let us place our thoughts
     upon holy things. Let them be pure and true; for the only security for
     any soul is right-thinking.”—Ellen G. White, The Signs of the Times,
     August 23, 1905.

      Suppose you had to express, verbally, to others the thoughts
      you have had during the past 24 hours. What would you say?
      How embarrassed would you be? What does your answer say
      to you about the changes you need to make?
                                                                         47

      Thoughts as a Source of Distress
     		
What are the things that really frighten you? What are ways that you
   can learn to trust the Lord, despite that fear? After all, isn’t the
   Lord’s power greater than whatever threats you face?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Much suffering can occur through thinking. Psychologist Philip
      Zimbardo, in his book Psychology and Life, reports the case of a
      young woman taken to a hospital because she was terrified of dying.
      Apparently there was nothing wrong with her, but she was admitted
      overnight for observation. Hours later she died. Further investigation
      showed that years before, a psychic had predicted her death on her
      twenty-third birthday. This woman died, a victim of her own panic,
      the day before she would have become 23. No question, people can
      suffer seriously from their negative thoughts; hence the need of
      wholesome thinking (tomorrow’s lesson).
        Also, just as important to remember: we also adversely can affect
      others’ thinking by expressing our negativity to others. Words are
      very powerful tools, either for good or for evil. Our words either build
      up or tear down. There is life and death in the words we speak. How
      careful we need to be with the thoughts and sentiments that come out
      of our mouths.

Read Acts 14:2, 15:24, and Galatians 3:1. What do they tell us about
      the power to impact people negatively?

        “If you do not feel lighthearted and joyous, do not talk of your feel-
      ings. Cast no shadow upon the lives of others. A cold, sunless religion
      never draws souls to Christ. It drives them away from Him into the
      nets that Satan has spread for the feet of the straying.”—Ellen G.
      White, The Ministry of Healing, p. 488.

       Think about times someone’s “mere” words tore you down in a
       big way. How can you be sure you never do that to anyone else?

      Wholesome Thinking
        “Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, what-
      ever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is
      admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about
      such things” (Phil. 4:8, NIV).

What is the essence of Paul’s words to us here? What is the key to
      doing what he says? See also 2 Pet. 3:1, 2.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Remembering, repeating, thinking about, and meditating on the
      words in the Bible is one of the greatest spiritual blessings available
      to us, and it is a sure way to cultivate what Peter called “wholesome
      thinking” (2 Pet. 3:1, NIV). Many people have obtained invaluable
      blessings by committing to memory treasured Bible texts. When con-
      fronted with moments of worry, doubt, fear, frustration, or temptation,
      they have repeated such thoughts in their minds and have obtained
      relief and peace through the power of the Holy Spirit.
        With so many alluring competitors (TV, computer, etc.), this gen-
      eration of believers is being tempted to put the Bible aside. It is neces-
      sary therefore to make a committed decision to read and reflect upon
      the Word every day. The Word of God is the only true fortification
      we have against the mental onslaught of unspiritual distractions that
      come from the world.

Look again at the text above. Make a list of what things you encoun-
      ter that are true, pure, lovely, and so forth. What does that list
      consist of? What do these things have in common? Bring your list
      to class and share it with others on Sabbath.


         Prayer is another way to keep the mind out of trouble. While we
      talk to God, there is little chance for lustful or other forms of self-
      ish thoughts. Acquiring prayerful habits is a sure protection from
      sinful thoughts and, consequently, from sinful actions. The Bible is
      clear: God cares about our thoughts, because our thoughts impact our
      words, our actions, and our overall well-being. God wants us to have
      good thoughts because good thoughts (wholesome thinking) are good
      for us, both physically and mentally. The good news is that through
      meditating on the Bible, through prayer, and through Spirit-inspired
      choices on our part, we can keep our minds and hearts on things that
      will uplift ourselves and others, as well.
                                                                            49

     The Thoughts of Our Hearts
       						
       Read 1 Kings 8:39, Psalm 19:14, 1 Chronicles 28:9, and 1 Samuel
     16:7. What crucial point are these texts making? More important, how
     should this truth impact us and how we think? Does this truth make
     you nervous and fearful, or does it give you hope? Or both? Analyze
     the reason for your answer.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       “For you alone know the hearts of all men” (1 Kings 8:39, NIV).
     The word heart often is used in the Bible as the seat of thoughts and
     emotions (see Matt. 9:4). Only God has access to the intimacy of our
     mental activity, to our true intentions, and to our secret yearnings.
     Nothing, even in the form of a fleeting thought, can be hidden from
     the Creator.
       God’s knowledge of our soul is to our advantage. When people are
     too discouraged to utter a sensible word of prayer, God knows their
     need. Humans can look only at the outer appearance and behaviors,
     and then try to imagine what someone else is thinking; God knows the
     thoughts in ways others never can.
       Likewise, Satan and his angels only can observe, listen, and esti-
     mate what goes on inside. “Satan cannot read our thoughts, but he can
     see our actions, hear our words; and from his long knowledge of the
     human family, he can shape his temptations to take advantage of our
     weak points of character.”—Ellen G. White, The Review and Herald,
     May 19, 1891.
       As you make everyday decisions (personal or work-related) or
     think of other people, pause for a moment and send a quiet prayer to
     God. Enjoy the understanding of an intimate dialogue that is for you
     and God alone. Nobody else in the universe is privy to this commu-
     nication. Allowing Christ into your thinking process will safeguard
     you from temptation and bring spiritual blessings. This process will,
     beyond doubt, help you build a closer walk with the Lord.

      How does the day’s lesson help you better understand the bibli-
      cal admonition not to judge others? How many times have your
      motives been misjudged by those who don’t know your heart?
      Why, then, is it important not to judge others in return?

     The Peace of Christ in Our Hearts
Read Colossians 3:1–17. What are the specific actions that we are
     called upon to do in order to live the kind of life in Christ we are
     promised?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        This passage takes us to the root of moral and immoral behaviors,
     the heart and mind. It also points at the only One who can work good-
     ness in us by governing our thoughts, Jesus Christ: “Let the peace of
     Christ rule in your hearts” (Col. 3:15, NIV). Note expressions such as
     “set your hearts,” “set your minds,” “put on love,” “let the peace of
     Christ,” “let the word of Christ.” They indicate that avoiding sin and
     acquiring virtue are matters of choice and preparation, not improvisa-
     tion. Sin can be overcome only by setting hearts and minds on things
     from above. Christ is the source of virtue and goodness. Christ, when
     allowed by us, is the only One capable of bringing true peace to our
     minds.
        Our minds, then, being the core of our existence, need to be put
     under the care of Jesus. It is central to the development of character,
     and it cannot be left to the mercy of circumstances. Sinful tenden-
     cies and corrupt environments both work against purity in thought.
     Yet, the Lord does not leave us abandoned; He extends His help and
     protection to all who want it. “Our thoughts, if stayed upon God, will
     be guided by divine love and power.” Thus, we must “live on the
     words that proceed from the lips of Christ.”—Ellen G. White, Mind,
     Character, and Personality, vol. 2, p. 669.
        In the middle of spiritual warfare, a person may be tempted and find
     it very difficult to dispel certain adverse thoughts. In those moments,
     it may be easier to distract oneself by changing place or activity or
     seeking good company. This may permit a change that facilitates
     prayer and assurance.

      Thought is a very mysterious human process. We really don’t
      know for sure even what it is or exactly how it works. In most
      cases, though, in the inner recesses of our consciousness, we
      alone make the choice regarding what we are going to think
      about. A thought can be changed in an instant. We simply have
      to make the choice to change it. (In some cases, though, mental
      illness can affect a person’s ability to change their thoughts eas-
      ily, and so professional treatment [if available] can be extremely
      beneficial.) What about your thoughts? Next time the wrong
      ones come, what are you going to do?
                                                                        51
                       F riday February 4

    Further Study: “More precious than the golden wedge of Ophir is
         the power of right thought. We need to place a high value upon the
         right control of our thoughts. . . . Every impure thought defiles the
         soul, impairs the moral sense, and tends to obliterate the impressions of
         the Holy Spirit. It dims the spiritual vision, so that men cannot behold
1
         God. The Lord may and does forgive the repenting sinner; but though
         forgiven, the soul is marred. All impurity of speech and thought must be
         shunned by him who would have clear discernment of spiritual truth. . . .
         We are to use every means that God has placed within our reach for the
         government and cultivation of our thoughts. We are to bring our minds
         into harmony with Christ’s mind. His truth will sanctify us, body, soul,
2        and spirit, and we shall be enabled to rise above temptation.”—Ellen G.
         White, The Signs of the Times, August 23, 1905.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 In class, go over the list you made on Tuesday and compare
          yours with others in your class. What can you learn from one
          another’s picks?

3         l2 What is the meaning of “bringing into captivity every thought

          to the obedience of Christ”? 2 Cor. 10:5. How can we learn to
          do that?

          l
          3 How do the Internet, TV programs, recreational reading,
          advertisements, et cetera, work in your mind? How much of your
          thinking and doing may be affected by these sources? Why do we
          fool ourselves if we believe that what we read or watch doesn’t
          impact our thinking?

          l
          4 What are ways in which our actions, even subconsciously,
          reveal the thoughts in our minds? How does body language show
          what’s going on inside?

          l
          5 What advice would you give to someone who is struggling with
          impulsive behavior? What promises can you present to them
          from the Bible? Why is it also important to keep before them all
          the promises of forgiveness and acceptance through Jesus? How
          can you keep them from giving up in complete despair, believing
          that, because they have not achieved the victory that they want,
          their relationship with God is somehow deficient? How can you

The Power of Faith
by Benjamin Schoun
   Ragasa lives in Madagascar, an island off the eastern coast of Africa.
She grew up in a family that worshiped demons. When she reached adult-
hood the demons told her that if she did as they asked, they would give
her great powers.
   Ragasa agreed. The demons gave her powers to control lightning, with-
stand bullets, and much more. Through her powers, Ragasa became an
influential woman. Then she did something that angered the demons, and
they caused her to became seriously ill. No one could help her; and the
demons to whom she had turned in the past refused to make her well.
   One day she heard a knock at the door. She answered the door and
found two young women standing there. As they talked with Ragasa, she
felt comfortable with these strangers. She related her struggles with the
demons and her resulting sickness.
   The young women told Ragasa that they were Seventh-day Adventist
Christians, and they asked if they could pray for her. Ragasa agreed, for
she had no other options.
   In a short time Ragasa was well. She began studying the Bible with her
new friends. The women encouraged Ragasa to listen to Adventist World
Radio, for it would bring her comfort and help her in her struggles against
the demons. Ragasa listened to the station, and soon she fell deeply in love
with Jesus Christ.
   Adventists in the region learned of Ragasa’s conversion and fasted and
prayed for her before her baptism. The demons were powerless in the face of
God’s praying children, and Ragasa was baptized without trouble from her
former masters.
   Because of the love of the two young visitors and the ministry of Adventist
World Radio, God transformed this once-powerful, demon-possessed woman
into a humble Christian servant. In gratitude to God for His salvation, Ragasa
invites others to listen to Adventist World Radio with her. Now a congrega-
tion of more than 100 worship together around Ragasa’s radio every week.
   Congregations such as Ragasa’s have no pastor; they have no teacher
except the radio programs. They have no church building, for they cannot
afford one. Yet they believe and worship as we do.

  Your mission offerings help support the work of Adventist World Radio
and other outreach programs around the world. Thank you for sharing so
that others, like Ragasa, can know that God loves them.

Benjamin Schoun is president of Adventist World Radio.

     Sabbath Afternoon				
       				
Read for This Week’s Study: Psalm 42, 31:10, 39:2–7,
     32:1–5, 1 John 1:9, Mic. 7:1–7, Rev. 21:2–4.

Memory Text: “The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and
     saves those who are crushed in spirit” (Psalm 34:18, NIV).



     D
              epression, or extreme discouragement to the point of becom-
              ing disabled, has been experienced since the inception of sin.
              A number of Bible characters displayed symptoms that prob-
     ably would meet today’s diagnostic criteria for depression.
        Hopelessness is a symptom of depression, and the biblical message
     of hope can offer us so much in contrast to a world that offers so
     little. All people, at times, face moments of extreme discouragement
     for any variety of reasons. No wonder, then, that the Word of God is
     filled with promises that can give all of us, no matter our situation,
     reasons to hope for a better future, if not in this world, then certainly
     in the next.
        Of course, when depression is severe, it’s important to get profes-
     sional help, when possible. The Lord can work through these people
     to help those who are in need of special care. After all, regardless of
     your relationship with God, were you physically ill you would seek
     the help of a doctor or health professional. It’s the same with those
     who are suffering from severe clinical depression, which often is
     caused by a genetic predisposition and chemical imbalance in the
     brain. Thus, even Christians, at times, might need the help of profes-
     sionals.

     The Downcast Soul
Read Psalm 42. How can you relate to what’s being expressed there?
     What hope is offered?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       David experienced serious mood alterations, on many occasions
     because of unfair persecution (for instance, Saul and Israel’s adver-
     saries). In addition, his violation of God’s commandments brought
     about a deep sense of guilt (Ps. 51:4), and guilt often is associated
     with depression.
       When one sees oneself negatively (“I am dumb”), looks at the
     world pessimistically (“life is always unfair”), and contemplates the
     future hopelessly (“it will never improve”), chances of depression
     become high. This attitude is called “catastrophic thinking.”
       Christians may opt for alternative ways to interpret things, a way
     that incorporates God’s plan and messages into the equation.

     Consider the following alternatives:

      • How to look at yourself. You were created in God’s image, to rule over
        creation (Gen. 1:26, 27). God’s traits, albeit marred, are still in you.
        Jesus Christ, through His sacrifice, rescued you from eternal death and
        granted you privileges—chosen people, royal priesthood, holy nation
        (1 Pet. 2:9, NIV). Before God’s eyes you have infinite worth.

      • The world. It is true that the world is rotten and full of evil. At the
        same time, there also are many right, noble, and admirable things
        (Phil. 4:8) to ponder upon. Furthermore, Christians can understand
        the existence of evil without despair, as they know its origin and
        ultimate fate.

      • The future. What a wonderful future is reserved for God’s children!
        The Bible is full of promises with the assurance of salvation (Ps.
        37:39).

      Sadness is not a sin. After all, look at how often Jesus felt sad.
      We mustn’t feel guilty because of sadness or depression. In
      some cases we have good reasons to be hurting. How can you
      use the biblical truths stated above to help you cope with what-
      ever struggles you are facing now?

     The Consequences of Discouragement
        “ ‘I cried like a swift or thrush, I moaned like a mourning dove.
     My eyes grew weak as I looked to the heavens. I am troubled; O
     Lord, come to my aid!’ ” (Isa. 38:14, NIV). 				
     					
        The biblical description above leaves no doubt about the strong
     pain manifested by Hezekiah’s crying out loud. There are cultural dif-
     ferences in manifesting emotional distress. People in certain contexts
     suffer in silence, avoiding any obvious or visible complaint. Others
     (like Hezekiah) use moaning and wailing when going through sorrow.
     There also are personal differences; some people are able to approach
     death with more tranquillity than others can.
        Depressive symptoms commonly are found in individuals with a pro-
     longed or terminal disease. Hezekiah was suffering from illness, and its
     gravity announced death. Thus, he experienced a spell of depression as
     described in Isaiah 38. Depressive symptoms are so painful that many
     will attempt suicide to end this horrible experience. In fact, more than
     10 percent of clinically depressed patients kill themselves. Clearly,
     clinical depression is a serious matter and must be treated that way.

What symptoms are expressed in the following texts?

       Ps. 31:10 ___________________________________________

       Ps. 77:4 ____________________________________________

       Ps. 102:4, 5 _________________________________________

       1 Kings 19:4 ________________________________________

       Depression causes a variety of painful manifestations: (a) a deep
     sense of sadness (sorrow), (b) a lack of motivation to do anything, even
     enjoyable activities, (c) a change in appetite and either weight loss or
     gain, (d) sleep disturbances, sleeping either not enough or too much,
     (e) feelings of low self-esteem, (f) poor reasoning and memory, and (g)
     thoughts of death and suicide. Some people experience just one or two
     symptoms, while others manifest several and suffer for months until the
     episode ends. In any case, the burden of depression is enormous and
     must be relieved by medical and spiritual intervention.

      We all suffer sadness and discouragement in one form or
      another for one reason or another at one time or another. What
      things bring you down and why? Recall incidents of God’s past
      guidance in your life. What hope and encouragement can you
      draw from remembering the Lord’s leading? Why is it impor-
58    tant to keep those memories alive?

     Relief From Depression
Read Psalm 39:2–7. What happened when David remained silent?
     And what was the result of his speaking up?

     ________________________________________________________

        Like most emotional disorders, depression necessitates that the
     sufferer speak about his or her struggles. This act alone can begin to
     initiate healing. Approaching the Lord in fervent and sincere prayer
     is a safe way to release tension and psychological pain. Often more is
     needed, but it can be a good start.
        A basic coping strategy for depression consists of talking to a
     friend (or a therapist) who knows how to listen and, even better, who
     knows how to help access more intensive resources, if needed. There
     is a healing effect in verbalizing thoughts and feelings. The church
     community can provide an excellent context to help the discouraged,
     but often this is insufficient, especially when professional care is
     required. Nevertheless, it is important for anyone going through hard
     times and who feels discouraged or even depressed to have someone
     they trust to talk 10. Sometimes merely talking to someone can go a
     long way in helping a person feel better.

Read Psalm 55:17. What promise is there? Why should this promise
     mean so much to us?

     ________________________________________________________

        The counselor’s appointment, if possible at all, may not be avail-
     able until next week. But like David—who learned how to get help
     any hour of the day or any day of the week—we, too, can turn to the
     Lord at any time. David knew that the Lord heard his voice, and that
     greatly encouraged him.
        Even secular psychologists are recommending that clients who
     believe in prayer pray. All of us, even when not suffering with some-
     thing such as clinical depression, can experience the impact of how
     praying to the Lord does help make us feel better. No matter who we are
     or how deep our discouragement, having a relationship with God can go
     a long way in bringing us hope and encouragement and healing.

      Ellen G. White once described prayer as “the opening of the
      heart to God as to a friend.”—Testimonies for the Church, vol.
      4, p. 533. Though prayer doesn’t always solve all our problems,
      how does it help us deal with them?


                                                                        59

      The Need for Forgiveness
How did David find relief for his agony? Ps. 32:1–5; see also 1 John
      1:9. How can we find this same thing for ourselves?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

         The guilt produced by unconfessed sins may become extremely
      painful. The expressions used by David are a clear indication of
      intense, inward pain. Psalm 32 and other passages in Psalms show the
      severity of David’s emotional distress.
         When we meet sufferers of depression, we must be extremely care-
      ful not to blame them for not having confessed their sins! Nor should
      we simply conclude that they are wicked people, and that’s why they
      are in distress. It is unfortunate that many people seem to be able to
      offer concern and understanding to those suffering from an organic
      malady, true clinical depression, but tend to be quite judgmental in
      dealing with mental or emotional turmoil brought about by their own
      wrong actions.
         Edgar Allen Poe in his “Tell-Tale Heart” refers to the story of a man
      who committed murder and hid the victim’s body under the floorboards
      of the room in which the murder had been committed. He hoped to
      leave his guilt hidden with the body, but a strong sense of remorse grew
      within him. One day he heard the victim’s heartbeat; and the beat grew
      louder and louder. Later it became clear that the pounding was coming
      not from the grave below but rather, from his own heart.
         At the same time, too, there are people who, having confessed their
      sins, still suffer greatly from a sense of guilt. They often feel unwor-
      thy of forgiveness and lament the horrible suffering that they have
      brought through their sins, even though they have been confessed
      and are, by faith, forgiven by God. This, too, can be a great source
      of emotional distress. In such cases, it’s important to focus on God’s
      promises of healing and of acceptance, even for the worst of sins.
      We can’t undo the past; what we can do, by God’s grace, is seek to
      learn from our past mistakes and, to whatever degree possible, make
      restitution for whatever wrong we have done. After all, all we can do
      is surrender to God and seek His mercy, grace, and healing.

       Many, having confessed their sins, still struggle with guilt over
       them. Why is it so important that we acknowledge our sins,
       take responsibility for them, and learn to move on and get past
       whatever wrongs we have done?

      Hope Against Distress
What was the prophet’s way out of the surrounding social and inter-
      personal problems? Mic. 7:1–7.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________
         				
         In just the first six verses, Micah describes a complete smorgas-
      bord of immoral, unethical, and aggressive acts present in his time.
      Oppression and abuse of various kinds, lack of respect and consider-
      ation, corruption, and deceit all have been present since the inception
      of sin. We all face it even today. Just take today’s newspaper, and
      you can find a direct correlation with Israel’s misery at that time. This
      sociological chaos becomes especially hurtful when touching close to
      home—neighbor, friend, spouse, child, parent (Mic. 7:5, 6).
         Highly defective interpersonal relationships cause much stress and
      are associated with depression. Clearly stated by Micah (vs. 7), the
      conclusive ingredient to survive in the middle of a crisis is hope.
         Hope is essential to live our lives with a reasonable amount of
      mental health. Hope must be alive even for the unbeliever—youth in
      search of employment must hope that they’ll find a job, a lost traveler
      will hope to find his way, and investors who have lost their money
      must believe that there will be better times. Living with zero hope
      leads to meaninglessness and death.
         When Italian philosopher and poet Dante Alighieri (a.d. 1265–1321)
      attempted to describe hell in his Divine Comedy, he envisioned a big
      sign at the entrance saying: “Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!”
      The worst possible punishment is to deprive someone of hope.
         The kind of hope presented in the Bible goes beyond positive anticipa-
      tion. It encompasses an eventual perfect solution and salvation based on
      redemption through Jesus Christ. The historic “blessed hope” of Seventh-
      day Adventists must become the focal point of our lives. Hoping for
      Jesus’ return helps us to gain perspective over the many unpleasant things
      that surround us and allows us to look in confidence toward eternity.

Look at these promises. What hope is offered there for us? Isa. 65:17,
      2 Pet. 3:13, Rev. 21:2–4. Why, in one sense, is this the only hope
      for any of us?

        A vision of faith in the new creation can reassure the suffering soul.
      In the same way that a woman in childbirth contemplates the final
      result of her child being born and soon “forgets the anguish” (John
      16:21, NIV), the troubled soul can, by God’s grace, gain hope with the
      vision of a caring God who promises us a new world without any of
      the things that bring so much sadness to us in this one.             61
                       F riday February 11

    Further Study: Read and reflect on Matthew 26:36–43. Jesus was
         overwhelmed with sorrow “ ‘to the point of death’ ” (vs. 38, NIV).
         Visualize the agony of Jesus, with lack of social support and betrayal
         from His disciples, seeming separation from God, and the load of
         guilt from humanity. His suffering exceeds any depressive episode
         experienced by mortals.
            “As He neared Gethsemane, He became strangely silent. He had often
         visited this spot for meditation and prayer; but never with a heart so full
         of sorrow as upon this night of His last agony. Throughout His life on
1        earth He had walked in the light of God’s presence. When in conflict
         with men who were inspired by the very spirit of Satan, He could say,
         ‘He that sent Me is with Me: the Father hath not left Me alone; for I do
         always those things that please Him.’ John 8:29. But now He seemed
         to be shut out from the light of God’s sustaining presence. Now He was
         numbered with the transgressors. The guilt of fallen humanity He must
2        bear. Upon Him who knew no sin must be laid the iniquity of us all. So
         dreadful does sin appear to Him, so great is the weight of guilt which
         He must bear, that He is tempted to fear it will shut Him out forever
         from His Father’s love. Feeling how terrible is the wrath of God against
         transgression, He exclaims, ‘My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto
         death.’ ”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 685.

    Discussion Questions:
3
          l1 What great role can your local church community play in
          helping those who are suffering depression or emotional distress
          for any reason at all? Whatever your resources are, no matter
          how limited, what more can be done to help those in need?

          l
          2 How can you help someone who prays, who counsels, who
          loves the Lord and who trusts in Him, and yet still feels over-
          whelmed with sadness, even if he or she doesn’t understand
          why? How can you help him or her not give up their faith but
          cling to the hope and promises given in the Word?

          l3 One of the greatest mistakes people can make is to believe
          that because they feel so down, so depressed, so hopeless, it
          means that God has abandoned them. Why is that, first of all,
          not true? What Bible characters (such as Elijah, Jeremiah in
          jail, John the Baptist in jail, Jesus in Gethsemane) can you point
          them to in order to show them that sadness and discouragement
          do not mean God has forsaken them? How can you help them
          learn that feelings are not a good barometer of faith?

Rodeo Stars Shine for Christ
by Mike Brownhill
   It’s not every day that rodeo champions turn their lives over to God,
but recently Dale and Patricia Jones, rodeo champions living in South
Queensland, Australia, did just that. They were baptized, and Dale’s
brother, Darryl, recommitted his life to God in a river that flows along the
edge of their farm. A few weeks later another brother, Stanley, recommit-
ted his life to God too.
   After studying the Bible with several people, Dale and Patricia made their
decision to commit their lives to God in baptism as Darryl and other family
members watched from the riverbank. Darryl felt that his first love for God
had faded, and he stepped into the river, boots and all, and was rebaptized.
   The Joneses come from a family of rodeo stars. Their father was a
champion, and Dale, Patricia, and Darryl all hold impressive rodeo
records and championships. These days, however, Dale and Patricia enjoy
a tamer life, breaking and training horses on their ranch.
   “The rodeo is a tough place to work,” Dale says. “I was proud, and
when I’d get hurt I wouldn’t admit it because I thought it was a sign of
weakness. Now God is softening my proud heart and reigning in my rebel-
lion. It’s still a struggle, and sometimes I must stop and ask God to take
over my life again.”
   Dale’s wife, Patricia, is a rodeo champion in roping and bull riding,
and Darryl holds titles in steer wrestling and is a rodeo circuit champion.
Darryl managed to earn these titles even while refusing to compete on
Sabbaths. “Since I’ve been rebaptized, I’ve regained my zeal in witness-
ing for my Lord,” Darryl says.
   Dale and Darryl credit their newfound zeal for God to their parents’
prayers. Bill and Bronwyn Jones have been praying for their sons and
daughter-in-law for years and rejoiced to see their prayers answered at the
riverside baptism.
   Patricia says, “Now that I’ve decided to follow Jesus, life is totally dif-
ferent. We’re lapping up the words of Christ. Living for God is so much
better than being national rodeo queen!”
   Dale and Patricia and their children worship in a new Seventh-day Adventist
congregation that was established as a result of a Global Mission outreach in
their area. Attendance at the congregation’s worship services averages about
30. Our mission offerings support Global Mission pioneers as they plant
churches in more than 100 countries around the world. Thank you!

Mike Brownhill was Global Mission project coordinator in South Queensland, Australia,
when Dale, Patricia, and Darryl Jones were baptized.

     Resilience



     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Job 19:25; James 5:10,
     11; Ruth 1; Esther 2; 2 Cor. 11:23–28; Phil. 4:11–13.

Memory Text: “God is our refuge and strength, an ever–present
     help in trouble. Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give
     way and the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, though its
     waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surg-
     ing” (Psalm 46:1–3, NIV).



     R
             esilience is the process of facing adversity, trauma, tragedy,
             threats, or extreme stress and “bouncing back” successfully
             without becoming too negatively affected by the experience. The
     concept has received growing attention because of the usefulness of pos-
     sessing a reasonable amount of resilience in the face of life’s difficulties.
     After all, who among us doesn’t face major stressors, in one form or
     another? The question is, How can we have the resilience to deal with
     what happens and not be destroyed emotionally in the process?
        In the 1960s, Victor and Mildred Goertzel wrote Cradles of
     Eminence, which presented biographical analyses of more than seven
     hundred subjects who went through great childhood adversity (broken
     homes, financial struggles, physical and/or psychological handicaps,
     etc.) and yet achieved great success. The book was updated in 2004.
        The Bible also tells us of individuals who had to face adversity but
     who, through God’s grace, bounced back and overcame their prob-
     lems. Despite difficult circumstances and even flaws in their charac-
     ters, they were able to be used by God because they had the resilience
     to press on, even amid adverse circumstances.

     The Patience of Job
Read James 5:10, 11. What is it about Job that makes him an exam-
     ple to be emulated? See also Job 1–3.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        A woman who underwent counseling to recover from a serious cri-
     sis told her friends that one idea transmitted by the counselor was key
     to her successful recovery. “What helped me most,” she said, “was the
     counselor insisting that my painful circumstances would come to an
     end. ‘It looks dark and unending now,’ the counselor used to say, ‘but
     it will not last too much longer.’ This thought helped me gain resil-
     ience.” In other words, the counselor kept the woman’s hope alive.
        How can we grow in patience? George Goodman of England once
     received a young man who needed to be prayed for. He expressed his
     need directly: “Mr. Goodman, I wish you would pray for me that I
     might have patience.”
        The elderly man responded, “Yes, I will pray for you that you may
     have tribulation.”
        “Oh no, sir,” the young man replied, “it is patience that I want.”
        “I understand,” said Goodman, “and I will pray for you that you may
     have tribulation.” The Bible teacher opened his Bible and read Romans
     5:3 to the amazed young man: “ ‘And not only so, but we glory in tribu-
     lations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience.’ ”
        The story of Job offers a supreme example of resilience. Earlier in
     his life, Job had understood that God is merciful and righteous. He did
     not understand the reasons for his suffering; he did not find support
     from his wife; his property and children were destroyed, and then he
     contracted a horrible disease. And yet, somehow amid it all, he never
     lost his faith in God and endured until the tragedy ended.

Read Job 19:25. What hope did Job cling to here? How can we better
     learn to cling to this hope in our own adversity, as well?

     Joseph in Captivity
        Read Genesis 37:19–28 and Genesis 39:12–20 and try to put your-
     self in Joseph’s sandals. Think how discouraged he must have been.
     Think of the potential for anger and bitterness that could have, even
     justifiably, been his. Though the Bible doesn’t tell us in detail what
     his emotions were, it’s not hard to imagine the pain he suffered from
     such betrayal and treachery.
        Nevertheless, Joseph turned to the Lord at these junctures, and in the
     end, good things came out of the events. After having been sold by his
     brothers, Joseph actually experienced his conversion and a much closer
     relationship with God. “He had been told of the Lord’s promises to Jacob,
     and how they had been fulfilled—how, in the hour of need, the angels of
     God had come to instruct, comfort, and protect him. And he had learned
     of the love of God in providing for men a Redeemer. Now all these pre-
     cious lessons came vividly before him. Joseph believed that the God of
     his fathers would be his God. He then and there gave himself fully to the
     Lord.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 213, 214.
        When he was thrown in prison unjustly, the experience opened the
     path to the court of Pharaoh to accomplish the mission to save many
     souls and his own people.

What do the following texts tell us about how bad situations can be
     turned to good?

       Rom. 5:3–5_____________________________________________

       2 Cor. 1:3, 4___________________________________________

       2 Cor. 1:8, 9___________________________________________

       2 Tim. 1:11, 12_________________________________________

       God does not want us to suffer needlessly. In fact, the environment
     Jesus has prepared for us in heaven is tearless and painless (Rev.
     21:4). But as we wait for that promise to be fulfilled, it seems certain
     that pain is the path to learn certain lessons. Character development,
     empathy, humility, discipleship, understanding of good and evil—
     these are some of the lessons we can learn. Although it is difficult to
     think of the benefits of suffering, especially in the midst of trial, we
     can ask God for the necessary strength to pass through difficulties.

      Have you ever had a terrible experience that in the end brought
      some good, some benefit? How can this help you learn to trust
      the Lord in any adversity, even when nothing good seems likely
      to result?

     Naomi
What are some of the misfortunes experienced by Naomi? Ruth 1.

     ________________________________________________________

        Leaving one’s country to settle somewhere else is always scary,
     especially when the departure is motivated by the need to survive. The
     famine in Judah forced Elimelech, Naomi, and their two sons to emi-
     grate to the country of Moab, an agricultural area where they could
     obtain food. The Moabites were an idolatrous people (Judg. 10:6)
     whose practices clashed with Jewish beliefs. This in itself must have
     produced significant turmoil to the newcomers. Sometime after hav-
     ing settled, Naomi’s husband died. Mother and sons found themselves
     in a foreign land, degraded to the condition of widow and orphans,
     without protection and subject to additional disgrace. Then Naomi’s
     sons, Mahlon and Kilion, married local women. This fact may have
     brought conflict to the family, at least in the beginning, because of
     significant religious differences. Although the law did not specifically
     prohibit marriages between Jews and Moabites, it was stipulated that
     Moabites or their descendants could not enter the assembly of the
     Lord until after ten generations (Deut. 23:3).
        Later on, Mahlon and Kilion, whose names meant “sickness” and
     “wasting,” respectively, also died. It is hard to imagine a more tragic
     situation in the life of Naomi—no one alive from her close family,
     and the remaining kin far away in Bethlehem.

What was the turning point in Naomi’s life? How did God repair the
     severe adversities suffered by Naomi? Ruth 1:16–18, 4:13–17.


        At the deepest moment of trouble Naomi’s daughter-in-law Ruth
     served as God-sent emotional support. Naomi must have been a
     remarkable woman to have inspired the devotion of her two daughters-
     in-law, especially Ruth, who accepted the God of Israel and made the
     firm decision to care for her mother-in-law for life in a land whose
     inhabitants were, historically, her enemies.
        Chapters 2 through 4 convey a beautiful succession of events that
     ended up in a happy family arrangement. Naomi left behind untold
     suffering and lived to witness the marriage of Ruth to Boaz and the
     birth of her grandson Obed, the father of Jesse, the father of David.

      However much we ultimately need to trust the Lord and sur-
      render everything to Him, at times we do need human help, as
      well. When was the last time you really needed someone’s help?
      What did you gain from that experience?
                                                                         67

     Esther’s Days of Stress
     				
What were some of the adversities, struggles, and pressures Esther
   faced?

       Esther 2:6, 7____________________________________________

       Esther 2:10_____________________________________________

       Esther 2:21, 22__________________________________________

       Esther 4:4–17___________________________________________

       Esther 7:3, 4; 8:3________________________________________

        Since early life Esther had been an orphan. Although she was
     adopted by her older cousin Mordecai, the stigma of parentless child-
     hood was most surely difficult. In spite of this, Esther grew up as a
     balanced, determined, and capable young woman.
        After she became queen, Esther did not reveal her nationality
     or family background. This was a particularly heavy challenge.
     Surrounded by food, luxuries, and practices of life in the court, Esther
     had to somehow try to maintain her Jewish faith and identity. In addi-
     tion, the risk of being identified as a member of the Jewish people
     was real, and the consequences of hiding her identity were uncertain.
        Esther also had to take to the king the bad news that officers were
     conspiring to kill him. This was not an easy task because, if the plot
     could not be substantiated, Esther and her cousin could be blamed for
     starting rumors, and who knew the results?
        But the greatest responsibility placed on Esther was being left as
     the sole channel to save her nation. Mordecai asked her to mediate
     on behalf of the Jews, which she could not do without risking her
     life. When she hesitated, her cousin put still more pressure on her: “If
     you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will
     arise from another place, but you and your father’s family will perish”
     (Esther 4:14, NIV). Talk about stress!
        Finally she appeared before the king, knowing that such an act car-
     ried with it a high chance of death. In the end, though, things worked
     out, however dangerous the situation was at times for this young
     woman.

      All of us, like Esther, are born into situations not of our own
      making. What is your background? What things were handed
      you, good and bad, that you didn’t ask for? How can you learn
      to appreciate more the good that you have been given and to
      overcome the bad?

      The Secret of Being Content
        Paul was born and grew up in Tarsus, into a Hebrew family from
      the tribe of Benjamin. He obtained his Roman nationality through
      his father, a citizen of the Roman Empire. He became a Pharisee, a
      devout group who adhered to the law (Torah) plus the oral tradition
      (Mishnah). With this background, he must have enjoyed the privi-
      leges of his social and religious status.
        However, when Paul responded to the call of Jesus, everything
      changed. Instead of persecutor, he became the target of radical perse-
      cution from some of his own nation and eventually from Romans. He
      suffered tribulations for three decades and was executed after having
      been imprisoned at Rome.

Read 2 Corinthians 11:23–28, which lists some of the adversities Paul
      had to face. Then read Philippians 4:11–13. After so much suffer-
      ing, what is the assessment Paul makes of his own life? What lessons
      are here for us amid whatever struggles we’re going through?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Contentment is a crucial component of happiness and psychological
      well-being. Being content comes to those who see the positive out-
      look of things, those who look at the past with acceptance and at the
      future with hope. Interestingly enough, having “everything” doesn’t
      guarantee contentment and happiness. For some folk, no matter what
      they have, it’s never enough. Others, having so little, are nevertheless
      satisfied. What do you think makes the difference?
        One of the many current definitions of “intelligence” is the ability
      to adapt to new situations. This may have to do with living in new
      places, relating to new people, or experiencing new socioeconomic
      conditions. Paul’s ability is not a hereditary trait, because he specifi-
      cally says, “I have learned to be content” (Phil. 4:12, NIV). This is not
      a capacity that some possess and others do not. Adaptation and con-
      tentment amid a wide range of circumstances are learned processes
      that come as a result of time and practice.
        Verse 13 gives the ultimate key to Paul’s resilience. Not only could
      he feel contentment with little or much material resources. He could
      do anything and everything in Jesus Christ.

       How content are you? How much are you tossed around and
       victimized by your circumstances? What are ways in which you
       can learn better to be “content in any and every situation” (vs.
       12, NIV)?
                                                                           69

    Further Study: “The powers of darkness gather about the soul and shut
          Jesus from our sight, and at times we can only wait in sorrow and
          amazement until the cloud passes over. These seasons are sometimes
          terrible. Hope seems to fail, and despair seizes upon us. In these
          dreadful hours we must learn to trust, to depend solely upon the merits
          of the atonement, and in all our helpless unworthiness cast ourselves
          upon the merits of the crucified and risen Saviour. We shall never
          perish while we do this—never! When light shines on our pathway,
          it is no great thing to be strong in the strength of grace. But to wait
1
          patiently in hope when clouds envelop us and all is dark requires
          faith and submission which causes our will to be swallowed up in the
          will of God. We are too quickly discouraged, and earnestly cry for
          the trial to be removed from us, when we should plead for patience
          to endure and grace to overcome.”—Ellen G. White, God’s Amazing
          Grace, p. 114.

    Discussion Questions:
           l
           1 Some people overcome hardships that others are crushed
           under. What do you think makes the difference?

           l2 Dwell more on the question of trials and tragedy that don’t
           seem to have any kind of happy ending. What are we to make of
           them? How do we reconcile them with our faith and the promises
3          of God?

           l
           3 In the third sentence of the quote in Friday’s study (“In these
           dreadful hours we must . . .”), what is Ellen G. White telling us?
           Where is she pointing our hope? Why, in the end, is the gospel,
           as presented in these words, our only hope, regardless of the
           tragedy that happens to us now?

           l4 How can you practically apply Peter’s counsel in 1 Peter 4:12,
           13? It’s one thing to remain resilient and faithful amid trial, but
           to do what Peter says? How is that possible?

           l5 Suppose you were dealing with someone in a very dire situa-
           tion, one in which there seemed no way out, humanly speaking.
           Suppose, too, that you had only five minutes with that person. In
           those few minutes, what would you say to give the person hope?

Called to Serve
by Kham
   I grew up in a Buddhist family in Southeast Asia. My best friend in col-
lege was a Seventh-day Adventist. I knew nothing about God or Jesus or
Christianity, and sometimes I teased my friend about his religion, but he
never became angry with me. I think that deep in my heart, where I wasn’t
even aware of it yet, God was speaking to me.
   Another girl shared her faith with me and challenged me to read the
Bible and learn for myself who God is. She promised that in its pages I
would find Jesus and salvation.
   I decided to learn more about this Jesus and told my best friend. He
introduced me to his uncle, a pastor, who offered to study with me. I
wanted to know two things: is the Bible true, and who is this Jesus?
   The pastor taught me the Bible through its stories. He taught me how
to understand God’s Written Word and how to pray. The more I sought to
know Christ, the more amazed I was at what I found in the Bible. I sur-
rendered my life to God and asked to be baptized.
   I finished my studies and took a job as an accountant with an interna-
tional firm. The job paid well, and life was good.
   Then I received an e-mail inviting me to serve as a volunteer accoun-
tant at Yap Seventh-day Adventist School. I had never heard of Yap, but
I knew that God was calling me to serve Him there. It took a lot of faith,
but I resigned my job and accepted the call to Yap.
   It’s a big step to give up a good job and steady income to live a simple
life on a tiny island in the South Pacific. But I’m learning to trust God for
everything. He knows what I need and always provides.
   During my time in Yap, God has taught me how to trust Him and to
keep my eyes focused on Him. The culture is so different from my own,
but the people I serve are God’s children, and I’ve learned to love them.
He has given me new perspective and teaches me His love and grace.
   I am amazed that God invited me, a young Buddhist boy, to become a
soldier in His army. Every day He reminds me that I am His and that the
children and parents I serve are His also. What a privilege and honor to
work for Christ and share His love with others.




Kham wrote his story while serving as the accountant at the Yap Adventist School in
Micronesia.

     Self-esteem
       							

       							




     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Ps. 100:3, Acts 17:24–28,
     Rom. 12:3, Matt. 22:39, 2 Samuel 9, Luke 15, Eph. 4:23–32.

Memory Text: “But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood,
     a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the
     praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful
     light” (1 Peter 2:9, NIV).



     D
              iminished self-esteem is a modern plague. It often is brought
              to the counseling or pastoral offices either by itself or in asso-
              ciation with such full-blown problems as substance-related
     abuse, depression, or eating disorders.
        In everyday existence, low self-esteem never may reach clinical
     proportions, but it almost invariably hurts relationships and impairs
     performance in most areas of life.
        Perhaps the main reason people suffer more than ever from this
     problem is the media, which often portrays its celebrities as larger
     than life, leaving others to feel their own inadequacy in contrast to the
     icons paraded before them.
        The idea of self-esteem as presented in the Bible has a different
     perspective. Conventional psychology sees self-esteem as the evalua-
     tion someone makes of their own attributes and characteristics based
     on their observation of themselves and on others’ input. The Bible
     offers at least two additional components: What humans are by origin
     (Gen. 1:26, 27) and what God thinks of and grants to each person
     (John 3:16). When we add these components, so much regarding
     self-esteem can change.

     Origins
       Two prevailing views of human origins exist, each mutually exclu-
     sive of the other. One portrays humans as products of pure chance, the
     result of a cosmic accident in which our existence wasn’t planned for.
     We just happened to come into existence. Though this view always
     has existed among some people, in recent centuries—particularly
     after the false theories of Charles Darwin became popular—the idea
     of humanity existing purely by accident has deceived millions. Thus,
     many have come to believe that life is inherently without purpose, or
     that any purpose it might have individuals must try to make for them-
     selves. For millennia most people thought that they had originated
     from God or from gods; today, many think that they came from the
     apes.
       In contrast, there’s the view taught in the Bible.

Read Genesis 1:26, 27; Psalm 8:5; 100:3; and Acts 17:24–28. How
     radically different is what’s presented in these texts from the view
     of our origins as expressed previously? How should each view
     impact our own sense of self-worth and self-esteem?

        Not only did God purposely create us, He created us in His image.
     He also created other wonderful, life-bearing plants and animals, but
     in their beauty and perfection they do not bear resemblance to their
     Maker as humans do. Furthermore, humanity is placed above all of
     them with dominion and authority.
        In contrast to the atheist belief in no transcendent purpose for our
     human biology and psychology, the Bible teaches us that God chose
     to share “His image” with the human family. Obviously, much of that
     image has been marred and lost by generations of sin, yet the imprint
     continues in each person, and that lost image can be restored progres-
     sively by the transforming power of the Spirit working in those who
     are surrendered to Christ.

      Not only did God create us, He redeemed us, as well. In fact,
      Ellen White said that Christ would have died for even one per-
      son. What does that tell us about our inherent worth, regardless
      of what the world might think of us? Why is it so important to
      keep before us our worth in the eyes of God?

                                                                        73

     Self-perceptions
       What I see in myself is one important component of self-esteem.
     However, it is an incomplete and often faulty picture. Subjectivity can
     lead to misinterpretation when assessing people, including ourselves.
       One of the gravest biblical warnings is against passing judgment
     on someone else: “For at whatever point you judge the other, you
     are condemning yourself ” (Rom. 2:1, NIV; see also Luke 6:41, 42).
     Distortion seems universal, and people are subject to commit mistakes
     when judging others. The same happens with self. There is a great
     deal of error when one judges oneself in terms of ability, looks, char-
     acter, power, etc. There always are going to be people smarter, better
     looking, and more gifted than you; at the same time, there always will
     be people who will look at you and feel themselves to be inferior.

Read prayerfully and carefully Matthew 22:39. What is implied in
     this text regarding how we should view ourselves?
     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        This text implies that a reasonable amount of love should go to oneself
     (though this is not the main focus of the text). There should be a healthy
     pride in things well done, in well-accomplished tasks, and in the good
     traits and characteristics one may possess. There is an expected attitude of
     self-protection and caring for oneself. The problem comes when someone
     does not give credit to God, the Creator of all good things in us.

How are we to understand Romans 12:3 in light of what we’ve looked
     at so far?
     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        There is a desirable middle area between extremely low self-esteem
     and arrogance. And Paul warns against the latter. At the same time,
     Romans 12:4–8 explains that the body of Christ needs the input of
     each member, according to the individual gifts given by grace. There
     is nothing wrong in acknowledging each gift, using them to strengthen
     Christ’s church, and thanking God for them.

      Make a mental list of the good personal attributes, characteris-
      tics, and abilities that God has given you. How can you use them
      and at the same time remain humble? How can looking daily at
      the Cross help keep us in our place?

     What Others See
       In so many societies, a person’s worth is determined by their tal-
     ents, gifts, appearance, and so forth. We do look at outward appear-
     ance (1 Sam. 16:7); after all, that’s all we can see. Thus, our concept
     of self often is shaped by the reaction others display, based on their
     outward observation of us. If everyone tells you that you are pretty,
     you will be more likely to view yourself as pretty.
       But there always is much more to each of us than meets the eye.
     Individuals experiencing poor self-esteem need to think in terms of
     personal traits or attributes that are of true value and not necessarily
     what the world values, because so often what the world values is of
     no value to God.

What are the things that your society and culture place so much
     value on? How important do you think those things are to God?


       There may be exceptions, but most societies tend to place excessive
     value in outward, observable features. However, other traits, such as
     honesty, kindness, temperance, or firm commitment to principles and
     ideals tend to have less value.

How does gender/class/nationality prejudice affect people’s self-
     esteem? What should be the Christian’s aim in terms of prejudice
     and discrimination? Gal. 3:28.
     ________________________________________________________
     ________________________________________________________

       The effects of prejudice are devastating on self-esteem and perfor-
     mance. As Christians, we should be making a concentrated effort to
     uplift and encourage others, regardless of their background.
       In 2 Samuel 9, there is the story of Mephibosheth, who could have
     been the target of retaliation by David. No wonder he showed fear,
     fell on his face to the ground, and called himself “a dead dog.” He also
     was crippled. The restoration of the family property, the reassignment
     of servants, and the honors granted no doubt brought to Mephibosheth
     an extra measure of self-worth. 			
       The influence that people have on others’ self-esteem is extremely
     powerful. More than we realize, we have the ability to shape others’
     self-concept through words, actions, and even how we look at them.

      How careful, or careless, are you with the way you impact the self-
      esteem of others? Think about your closest relationships. How can
      you help build up these people as opposed to tearing them down?
                                                                         75

     What God Sees
Read Luke 15. What should that one chapter alone tell us about our
     worth to God? How should this impact our own sense of self-
     esteem? What do these parables tell us about what God thinks of
     us? Why is this so important to know and to keep before us?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        If someone feels tempted to dwell upon being inferior, lost, or
     outcast, they should remember that something else goes with that
     condition—a special and intense care from God and His angels. The
     shepherd cared more for the lost sheep than for the remaining ninety-
     nine. The woman forgot her other coins and searched carefully until
     she found the lost one. The father appears to have given more atten-
     tion to the unreasonable demands of the prodigal son than to his first-
     born. Shepherd, woman, and father all show a special consideration
     for the least successful individual.
        Then, when the lost are found, there is great joy on earth and in
     heaven. Look at how powerfully these stories reveal to us the love of
     God for each one of us, regardless of our faults.
        This principle can play out in helping those in need. So often, in
     talking with others, if you can give them a nonthreatening, confi-
     dential, and accepting environment, that alone can do them so much
     good. People, especially hurting people, need to know that someone
     cares for them, especially in their pain.
        A Christian has a clear advantage over someone who does not
     accept or believe in the Lord. God is on call 24 hours a day, 7 days
     a week, to listen to the depressed, stressed, lonely, and anxious soul.
     This relationship with God should be sufficient reason to feel special
     and to gain some relief from low self-esteem.
        Of course, the greatest example of our worth in the eyes of God is
     the Cross. That more than anything should show us just how valuable
     we are to God, regardless of whatever weaknesses and faults we have.
     The Cross tells us that no matter what others think of us, or what our
     society thinks of us, we are of infinite value to the Creator of the
     universe. And considering how fleeting and transitory and contingent
     society and its values are, in the end how much should the view of
     others and of society as a whole really matter to us anyway?

      How can we help others take the message in Luke 15 and apply
      it to themselves? How can we help others realize that Jesus here
76    is talking about them personally?

     A New Self
Read Ephesians 4:23, 24. What does Paul mean by “putting on” the
     new self? What is the nature of this new self?
     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________
        People like to try new looks: changing hairstyle, buying new types
     of clothes, even getting a face-lift or hair transplant. But these changes
     will bring only minor variations inside. The basic self will remain
     unchanged.
        Paul talks about a new self, related not to appearance but to attitude
     and mental nature. He says that we are “created to be like God in true
     righteousness and holiness” (vs. 24, NIV).

Outline the attitudes and behaviors coming out of the new self.
     Eph. 4:25–32.
     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________
        The new self referred to by Paul exhibits successful fruits (truthful-
     ness, unity, honesty, diligence, wholesome talk, kindness, forgive-
     ness). Notice, too, that all of the new self’s attributes have to do with
     good character and interpersonal relationships, and these can be tied
     directly to questions of self-esteem. The adverse behaviors mentioned
     in Ephesians 4, such as lying, anger, and bitterness, leave the person
     with a diminished sense of value. In contrast, sharing with those in
     need and being kind and compassionate are actions that can enhance
     self-esteem, as they change a person’s focus from self and thus leave
     the person with a sense of accomplishment.
        The Christian community needs people who are interested in building
     others up rather than destroying them. The concept of self easily can
     be ruined in no time with rude words of criticism. “Upon every fam-
     ily, upon every individual Christian, is laid the duty of barring the way
     against corrupt speech. When in the company of those who indulge in
     foolish talk, it is our duty to change the subject of conversation if pos-
     sible. By the help of the grace of God we should quietly drop words
     or introduce a subject that will turn the conversation into a profitable
     channel.”—Ellen G. White, Christ’s Object Lessons, p. 337.
      Why is it that helping somebody enhances your own self-
      esteem? Make a list of small things that you can do for your
      neighbor, partner, or family member. Do them; you may be
      surprised at how well you feel about yourself.
                                                                           77

    Further Study: “If God cares for a sparrow . . . how will he care
         for the purchase of the blood of Christ? One soul is worth more than
         all the world. For one soul Jesus would have passed through the agony
         of Calvary that that one might be saved in his kingdom. ‘Fear ye not
         therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.’ ”—Ellen G.
         White, The Review and Herald, May 3, 1892.
             “We lose many and rich blessings because we neglect to seek the
         Lord with humble hearts. When we come to Him in sincerity of heart,
         asking Him to reveal our defects, He will show us a true picture of
         ourselves, reflected in the mirror of His Word. Then, having seen
1
         ourselves as God sees us, let us not go away forgetting what manner
         of men we are. Let us study critically the features of our character
         that are defective, and seek for grace to make them like the pattern
         presented in the Word of God.”—Ellen G. White, The Lake Union
         Herald, November 3, 1909.

           The two paragraphs above give us additional insight to main-
         tain the balance between inferiority and vanity. Read Romans
         12:2, 3 in the light of these texts to gain understanding into attain-
         ing a balanced self-concept.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 The twentieth century was one of the most violent ever, with
3         mass murder seen on a scale as never before. How could the
          Darwinian view of human existence, which postulates that all
          life is a product of random mutation and natural selection, be
          partially responsible for this total disregard for the sanctity of
          human life? In other words, if human beings are just advanced
          apes, products of chance alone, what is the inherent value of an
          individual life?

          l
          2 Tuesday’s lesson looked at how the perceptions of others can
          impact a person’s self-worth. Though we want to affirm people
          and help them have a healthy sense of self-worth, we also need
          to be careful about feeding someone’s ego and pumping them up
          in ways that could be detrimental to them. How can we strike
          the right balance here—affirming people without, in the process,
          damaging them in a different way?

          l
          3 Dwell more on the question of what the cross of Christ teaches
          us about our individual worth. Think about what happened at
          the cross, who was on it, and what His death meant. How should
          the Cross help us have a better sense of what our individual
          worth really is?

The Stubborn Businessman
by Britto Amal Raj
   I am a stubborn man. I thought I could solve all my problems without
God’s help. But God showed me otherwise.
   When I opened my own business, I met unforeseen financial chal-
lenges that brought stress on my family and me. My wife urged me to
ask her parents for a loan to help us pay our bills, but I was proud and
refused.
   As the stress increased, so did my smoking and drinking. The family
begged me to quit, so I hid my habits from them. I went to church with
my family on Sundays, but I returned home unchanged.
   The Seventh-day Adventist pastor is one of my neighbors, and we
became friends. During one especially difficult time, I asked him for
advice and prayer regarding my financial problems. I needed to order a
shipment of rags with which to make floor mats, but I had no money to
pay for them. Without the rags, I couldn’t make mats to earn money. The
pastor prayed with me and encouraged me to trust God.
   The next day, I received an unexpected shipment of rags. I called the
company and learned that they had sent the rags without an order, and
I could pay over time. This was an answer to prayer! I made the mats,
paid for the rags, and had money for my other bills. Now the company
sends shipments on credit, and my business is growing.
    I began to think more about my relationship with God. When the
pastor invited me to visit the Adventist church, I went. I began seeing
my sinful life through God’s eyes, and I asked God for forgiveness
and strength to give up my bad habits. I threw away my cigarettes and
alcohol. I struggled with these temptations, but God delivered me, and I
haven’t smoked or drank since then.
   My pastor friend helped me commit my life completely to God. He
studied the Bible with me, and I was baptized.
   I’m sharing what I learn with my wife, and she listens. She sees the
miracles that God has performed in our lives, and while she doesn’t yet
attend church with me, she does join me for prayer every morning to
commit our lives and family to God.

  Your mission offerings help support the ongoing work in India, where
nearly a million Adventist believers live and share their faith. Thank
you!

     Jealousy
       				




       		



       					


     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Isa. 14:12–14; James
     3:16, 17; Exod. 20:17; Genesis 37; 1 Samuel 18; Matt. 12:14.

Memory Text: “Anger is cruel and fury overwhelming, but
     who can stand before jealousy?” (Proverbs 27:4, NIV).
        				


     O
              ne of the most devastating emotions is jealousy. It is the old-
              est type of sin (Isa. 14:14) and can hurt not only interpersonal
              relationships (2 Cor. 12:20) but our physical health, as well
     (Prov. 14:30).
        Jealousy tends to be personal; it targets an individual who is
     perceived as a rival and a threat. As a result, jealousy often causes
     violence, either psychological (verbal abuse, backbiting, criticism) or
     physical. Who hasn’t, at some point, felt the misery that this emotion
     brings?
        This lesson provides instances of individuals who allowed jealousy
     to impact their behavior: Satan, Joseph’s brothers, King Saul, and
     the chief priests of New Testament times. The result always was
     disastrous. How fascinating, too, that all of these jealous individuals
     enjoyed high status and privileges to begin with. Yet, all fell into the
     trap of hating someone else for what they were or what they had.
        The Lord warns us away from such an erroneous path and urges His
     children to love their neighbors to the point of rejoicing with them in
     their gifts, achievements, and possessions as if they were our own.

     At the Root of Evil
What was the cause of Satan’s expulsion from heaven? Isa. 14:12–14.
     What does it say about freedom that even in a perfect environ-
     ment, heaven, this terrible trait was able to arise?

     ________________________________________________________

       Lucifer, the most magnificent creature from the hands of God,
     was given the highest place in heaven outside of the Godhead. His
     honor, beauty, and intelligence were supreme; yet, sin nevertheless
     grew within him (Ezek. 28:12–15). The perfect peace and happiness
     of all creatures was greatly disturbed by this act of self-exaltation and
     jealousy toward Christ.
       “ ‘I will make myself like the Most High’ ” (Isa. 14:14, NIV) was
     the thought that triggered dissension, rebellion, violence, and much
     pain to all inhabitants of heaven and then to the entire human family.
     “Satan was jealous of Jesus. He wished to be consulted concerning
     the formation of man, and because he was not, he was filled with
     envy, jealousy, and hatred. He desired to receive the highest honors in
     heaven next to God.”—Ellen G. White, Early Writings, p. 145.
       By contrast, we look at Jesus. The inception of sin through jealousy
     and selfishness is rebuffed by Jesus’ willingness to be humbled to the
     lowest level of humankind and to be killed, like a criminal, in order
     that each person may be saved from the ultimate devastation caused
     by sin (2 Thess. 1:9).

Read James 3:16, 17. What contrasts are presented here? What
     should this tell us about how damaging and demonic jealousy is?

     ________________________________________________________

       Our sinful nature is such that the first bad deed makes the next one
     easier. When the wrong path is initiated with jealousy and selfish
     ambition, the result seems to be a smorgasbord of sin: “disorder and
     every evil practice” (vs. 16, NIV), as James describes it. The wonder-
     ful news is that there is room for another option, one that is “pure;
     then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good
     fruit, impartial and sincere” (vs. 17, NIV). This option is love.

      Lucifer did not look at what he had; instead, he chose to con-
      template what Christ had. How often do we tend to do some-
      thing similar? How much jealousy and envy do you harbor for
      those who have “more” than you? How can you overcome this
      dangerous emotion?

     Joseph’s Brothers
       So often jealousy and envy arise among those with whom we are
     very close, which makes the potential for serious consequences even
     more devastating. Indeed, a large portion of aggression (physical or
     psychological) today is found within the family circle, and jealousy
     and rivalry between family members is so often at the root.

Read Genesis 37. What is the background to the story? What led up
     to this criminal act? What role did jealousy play?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        It’s hard to believe that these brothers could have been so cruel. Did
     they not think, too, about what their actions would do to their father?
     Their jealousy became so powerful that it overruled not only common
     sense but common decency and morality, as well. What a powerful
     lesson this should be to all of us about how potentially dangerous this
     emotion is. No wonder there’s an entire commandment dedicated to
     warning us against it (see Exod. 20:17).
        Besides all the pain their actions brought upon themselves and their
     father, they also feared for what Joseph would do to them after the
     death of their father, Jacob (Gen. 50:15).
        But Joseph’s attitude could not be more noble, for he said: “ ‘Don’t
     be afraid. Am I in the place of God?’ ” (Gen. 50:19, NIV). Joseph had
     understood that his duty was to forgive the offenders and to trust in
     God’s mercy and justice.
        The life of Joseph has been compared to the life of Jesus Christ.
     Jealousy moved his brothers to sell him as a slave; some priests and
     elders were jealous of Jesus, and that jealousy fueled their actions
     against Him. Joseph was sold to the heathen; Jesus was sold to His
     enemies. Joseph was falsely accused and sent to prison because of
     his virtue; Jesus was falsely accused and rejected because of His
     righteousness. Joseph displayed noble benevolence toward his broth-
     ers; Jesus, too, forgave His enemies. The evil actions against Joseph
     ultimately led to good; the same thing happened with Jesus, in that the
     evil done against Him was turned to good, as well.

      What kind of pain and suffering has jealousy and envy—
      whether your own or someone else’s—brought to your life?
      What lessons have you learned from these experiences? How
      often, too, have you felt jealousy over things that today seem
      so trivial and meaningless? What lesson should you learn from
      that, as well?

     Saul’s Jealousy of David: Part 1
       A classic case of how jealousy works can be seen in the story of
     Saul and David. Saul was king, ruler over the nation. He had every-
     thing going for him, and yet jealousy entered, and it seemed to change
     everything about him.
       Or did the jealousy merely bring out what was already there inside
     Saul?

What was Saul’s initial attitude toward David? 1 Sam. 18:1–5.

     ________________________________________________________

       Saul’s actions show that he had a very positive attitude toward David,
     to whom he gave a high place in the army. Also, considering his own
     son’s attitude toward David, it was clear that David had royal favor.


What changed Saul’s attitude? 1 Sam. 18:6–9. Why is Saul’s attitude
     such a common human response?

     ________________________________________________________

       The rest of 1 Samuel 18 shows just how damaging Saul’s jealousy
     of David became. It led him to all sorts of deviousness and trickery,
     and yet, none of it worked. The very things that he feared in David
     became more and more pronounced!
       Jealousy generates a series of negative emotions: low self-esteem,
     hatred, suspicion, fear, guilt, and anger. Saul was afraid of David, as
     mentioned several times in the chapter. He might have been afraid of
     losing his kingly position or afraid of David becoming the absolute
     hero of Israel. But his main source of fear was “because the Lord was
     with David but had left Saul” (1 Sam. 18:12, NIV).
       Being left by God is reason enough to be afraid. But Saul’s fear was
     aggravated by the fact that “the Lord was with David” (vs. 12, NIV).
     Saul was unable to apply to the situation the simple logic of Gamaliel:
     “If [this] is of human origin, it will fail. But if it is from God, you will
     not be able to stop [it]” (Acts 5:38, 39, NIV). When the Lord blesses
     people, there is no point in developing jealousy or seeking their doom.
     God will continue to bless them.

      However wrong Saul’s attitude, why is it relatively easy to
      understand? What’s your immediate attitude to someone you
      deem could be a threat to your position? Do you surrender
      everything to the Lord, or do you start plotting a counter
      strategy?
                                                                             83

     Saul’s Jealousy of David: Part 2
Read 1 Samuel 19. What path can you see Saul on? What lessons are
     here for us?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Saul, at first, worked with some stealth and subtlety in seeking to
     remove the perceived threat of David. When that didn’t work, he came
     right out into the open with his murderous plans. Most likely he, at first,
     never dreamed he’d go that far. However, once the floodgates are opened
     to sin, none of us realize how far down the wrong path sin can lead us.
        Killing David became an obsession. Saul’s negative feelings, first
     harbored when women sang and danced to honor David, soon reached
     the point of murderous attempts on his life. In chapters 18 and 19
     alone we find eight specific attempts, either mandated or perpetrated
     by Saul himself, to murder David.
        The rest of the story is a sad one, as things grew worse for Saul. As
     his hatred and jealousy increased, he became irrationally suspicious of
     David, obsessive about killing him, and frightened of the surrounding
     Philistines. On the excuse that they had sided with David, he killed 85
     priests of the Lord and many men, women, children, infants, and farm
     animals in the priestly town of Nob (1 Sam. 22:17–19). Look at where
     he was being led!
        Full of terror because of the Philistine incursion, he asked the Lord
     what to do. But Saul had gone too far away from God, turning down
     divine advice too many times, so he did not obtain an answer. He chose,
     therefore, to consult an evil spirit through a witch, a practice that he
     himself had abolished. He even bowed down and prostrated himself with
     his face to the ground before the evil spirit, which was impersonating
     the deceased Samuel (1 Sam. 28:14). This was the beginning of his end,
     for the following day he and his sons lost their lives to the Philistines
     (1 Samuel 31), as forewarned by the evil spirit, obviously a demonic
     manifestation.
        Saul, by letting jealousy take root, followed a path to complete
     apostasy and ruin. Worse, his sin brought suffering not only on him-
     self but on his own family. Sin is bad enough when it hurts us as indi-
     viduals. Rarely, though, is the damage and pain so localized. In most
     cases, our wrong deeds impact others negatively, as well.
        Look at all the cases we’ve seen so far. In each example the jeal-
     ousy and the results of that jealousy had far-reaching consequences,
     most likely not anticipated by the one who first harbored the emo-
     tion. How crucial, then, that we by God’s grace seek to die to self the
     moment this ugly emotion arises in our hearts.

      Jealousy Toward Jesus
        “For he knew that they had handed Him over because of envy”
      (Matt. 27:18, NKJV).		

Skim over quickly the first 11 chapters of Matthew, focusing specifi-
      cally on what things Jesus did. Then read Matthew 12:14. What
      was it about Him and what He did that would have caused the lead-
      ers to respond this way? What did their actions reveal about their
      hearts? As you think about your answer, dwell on the question of
      how you might have responded were you in their situation.

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        The chief priests and elders were knowledgeable and exacting in
      the observance of the law. But their analysis of religious life was so
      microscopic that they had lost sight of the point of religion. Jesus
      brought a fresh view of piety, and the people of Israel (including
      religious leaders) heard the good news of salvation. Instead, though,
      of thanking Jesus for alerting them to their self-destructive path, they
      sought to destroy Him.
        How often folk let their own jealousy blind them to what should be
      obvious. After all that Jesus was doing, the miracles, the healing, the
      casting out of demons, it’s hard to imagine anyone questioning Him
      as being anything other than from God. The evidence He gave should
      have been more than convincing (see Matt. 11:4, 5).
        Perhaps because they were more aware of their own need, the com-
      mon people were more open to Jesus than were many of the religious
      leaders, who feared that Jesus would change the status quo and thus
      endanger their position. Jesus’ teaching was in many ways so differ-
      ent from theirs, and His message so much more appealing, that they
      had good reasons to fear His influence. Unfortunately for them, they
      were more concerned with preserving their own power and influence
      than they were in knowing and following the Truth.
        The fact that jealousy was motivating them wasn’t a secret.
      According to Matthew 27:18, even the Roman leader Pilate knew
      what their motives were. That’s how obvious it had become. Sadly,
      these leaders were so blinded by their jealously that they thought they
      were defending the faith against some impostor who was leading the
      people astray. Had they surrendered in humility and faith before the
      Lord instead of letting their jealousy overrule rational thinking, they
      would have avoided the tragic course that surely led them to eternal
      ruin. We would do well in our context, whatever it is, to learn from
      their mistakes.
                                                                          85

    Further Study: “Satan was once an honored angel in heaven, next
         to Christ. His countenance, like those of the other angels, was mild and
         expressive of happiness. His forehead was high and broad, showing
         great intelligence. His form was perfect; his bearing noble and majestic.
         But when God said to His Son, ‘Let us make man in our image,’ Satan
         was jealous of Jesus. He wished to be consulted concerning the forma-
         tion of man, and because he was not, he was filled with envy, jealousy,
1
         and hatred. He desired to receive the highest honors in heaven next to
         God.”—Ellen G. White, Early Writings, p. 145.
            “One great defect in the character of Saul was his love of approba-
         tion. This trait had had a controlling influence over his actions and
         thoughts; everything was marked by his desire for praise and self-
         exaltation. . . . It was the ambition of Saul to be first in the estimation
2
         of men; and when this song of praise was sung, a settled conviction
         entered the mind of the king that David would obtain the hearts of
         the people and reign in his stead. Saul opened his heart to the spirit
         of jealousy by which his soul was poisoned.”—Ellen G. White,
         Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 650.			
            			
    Discussion Questions:
3         l
          1 How many things do you have to be thankful for? Why is it
          so important to dwell on those things, as opposed to your prob-
          lems?

          l2 Can jealousy ever be good, ever be a motive for improving
          oneself ? Defend your answer.

          l3 Think about some of the Bible characters who displayed jeal-
          ousy in this week’s lesson: the most superior angel in heaven,
          the king of Israel, the religious leaders in Israel. These all were
          in exalted positions; these all had so much. And yet, they still
          allowed jealousy to come in and wreak havoc. What does that
          tell us about why jealousy is an internal problem, a problem of
          the heart, as opposed to something that arises only from outward
          conditions? Why could someone have so much of what this world
          offers and still be stung by the nasty bite of jealousy?

          l4 Ellen White wrote in Patriarchs and Prophets (see quote in
          Friday’s study) that the “one great defect” in the character of
          Saul was his love of being praised. Just one “little” defect, and
          look what happened. What should this tell us about the danger
          of not seeking to overcome all our character flaws before they
          overcome us? What Bible promises can you claim that should
          give you the hope and encouragement that victory over these
          defects can be yours?

Alive Again: Part 1
by Atte Helminen
   The Seventh-day Adventist Church in Salo, Finland, was, like many
churches, slowly dying. A handful of aging members struggled to keep the
church open, and no new members had been added in years. The members
had to decide: would they let their church die? Or would they do whatever
it took to bring it back to life?
   Members prayed for forgiveness for their narrow-minded views and
asked God to pull them out of their self-serving mindset and make them
other-oriented. They resolved to become a caring community and began
reaching out to people they never would have invited to worship before.
   A pastor from another town taught them how to reach out to others
and share their faith. He taught them how to give Bible studies in a more
open and accepting manner than they were used to and challenged them
to create their own ministries using the talents and spiritual gifts God had
given them.
   The members held a health expo that drew crowds from the first day. At
the expo, members invited visitors to come to a series of Meet Jesus meet-
ings. Their efforts worked, and within a few months three women joined
the church, the first baptism the church had celebrated in years. During the
first year, 12 people were baptized. Word spread that the church was alive
again, and some Adventists from other areas of the country came to help
revive the church. Within three years, church membership doubled.
   “We’re learning to be more loving and to use our spiritual gifts for
God’s work,” one member says, smiling. “Each of us has found a place in
God’s plan for His church. We now have a common joy and a common
purpose, and that is to enlarge the family of God.”
   And the church continues to grow as people who need hope and love
find people with hope and love to share.
   Helena was going through a life-and-death struggle with alcohol.
Doctors told her to quit or die. One day she came to the church uninvited
and smelling of alcohol. Her mother had once been an Adventist, she said,
and she just came in one day. Church members welcomed her and cared
for her needs. They visited her and tried to be like Jesus to her. Today
Helena is alcohol free and a different person. She has been baptized and
has become a strong witness for Jesus.

     I
         n recent years, many people have broken free from political tyr-
         anny and bondage. But there’s another kind of bondage, one that
         can be just as bad as or worse than its political counterpart—the
     bondage that comes from being an addict. Alcohol, tobacco, and other
     substances have enslaved millions. Furthermore, powerful nonchemi-
     cal addictions are on the rise, too: sex, pornography, gambling (or
     risky investments), and the accumulation of money/goods.
        All addictions create dependence (one feels very uncomfortable
     until the substance is taken or the act realized) and a certain degree
     of tolerance (one needs a bit more of it to reach the effect of previous
     times). Thus, it becomes extremely difficult for addicted people to
     break away from the cycle that has captured them. For this reason,
     those trapped need support from family, church, and friends. They
     also might need professional care and, above all, the power of God
     working in their lives to give them the freedom that they’re promised
     in Christ the Lord.

     Alcoholic Beverages
       Wine, beer, and other liquor have been associated in the Western
     world with memorable events, happy occasions, holidays, and
     important business transactions. There is a seemingly clean and
     beautiful face to alcoholic beverages. They not only have become
     socially acceptable but also a “necessity” in certain circumstances.
     Unfortunately, there’s another side to alcohol that those who make
     their living selling it don’t want their potential customers to see.

Read Proverbs 23:29–35. What do these verses say about the adverse
     effects of alcohol? From your own experiences, what have you
     seen of the devastating effects from the use of this poison?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        The image of beautiful wine soon biting like a snake and poisoning
     like a viper is powerful. Alcohol’s chemical makeup is treated by the
     human body not as food but as a toxic substance. It is absorbed into the
     stomach and transported by the bloodstream to the brain, lungs, kidneys,
     and heart in just a few minutes. The liver especially is taxed in order to
     process a substance that takes hours of hard work to break down. When
     the presence of alcohol is chronic and prolonged significantly, the organs
     deteriorate, and the person suffers from one or more illnesses.
        Unfortunately, the effects of alcohol transcend the drinker. Alcohol
     use comes with a terrible social cost. Half of all automobile and work-
     place accidents are alcohol-related. Many crimes are committed under
     the effect of alcohol. Public and private funds are depleted to provide
     health care to cure maladies caused directly by alcohol. And, closer to
     home, the spouse and children of the addict often are victims of verbal
     and physical abuse.
        Alcohol, as well as any other psychoactive substance, will affect
     our ability to make the correct moral choices; under the influence,
     folk are likely to slip deeper and deeper into sin.
        Those trapped in any kind of substance abuse need to realize
     their problem and their need of help from a power greater than
     themselves—and that includes God’s grace, the support of family or
     a caring church community, and the treatment prescribed by qualified
     professionals (if possible).

      As Seventh-day Adventists, we take a very strong line on alco-
      hol use. Without judging or condemning them, how can we help
      those among us who are struggling with this problem?

     Sex Addiction
What does the Bible say about sex as a source of enjoyment and
     strengthening marriage relationships? Prov. 5:18, 19; 1 Cor. 7:2–5.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Sex is one of the many enjoyable gifts that God has granted to men
     and women. God designed it not only for procreation but also to be a
     source of joy, closeness, and unity—but only in the context of mar-
     riage between one man and one woman (Gen. 1:27, 28; 1 Cor. 7:2).
     When taken away from this God-ordained framework and purpose,
     the gift becomes sin—sin often with devastating consequences (see
     1 Cor. 6:18, 19). God alone knows the extent of havoc that sexual
     immorality has brought to the human family.
        Sex is a very strong drive and thus readily open to abuse. It easily
     can become an absorbing obsession, one that’s very difficult to con-
     trol. Worse, the more one indulges in it, the more and more sex one
     needs in order to reach the level of satisfaction attained earlier.
        Prostitution and adultery are traditional paths into sexual immoral-
     ity and addiction (see Prov. 5:3–14, 9:13–18). In addition, other
     forms of sex addiction are available today, such as pornography and
     cybersex. Internet pornography has created a staggering problem
     because, with a few mere clicks of a mouse, it can put the most vile
     and degrading acts into our homes and offices. These practices are
     highly capable of creating addiction, compulsion, and deterioration of
     marriage and family ties. It’s impossible to calculate the damage, for
     instance, that adultery has created in the world.
        Sexual immorality is easy to start, and those who have not fallen
     into its trap will do well in keeping far from it. How crucial that when
     confronted with sexual temptations outside the sacred bonds of mar-
     riage, each person should act as Joseph did (see Gen. 39:7–12).
        God is willing to grant full pardon and freedom to anyone trapped
     in sex addictions. Submission to Him is crucial (James 4:7). But the
     addiction mechanism is so intricate that professional help may be
     needed. Support groups that incorporate God as the ultimate Source
     of help and include specialized skills to treat the problem can be of
     great benefit, if available.

      How can you help someone who, though guilty of sin in this
      area, is seeking to know God’s forgiveness and healing? Sup-
      pose you are struggling here. How can you know that all hope
      is not lost, just as long as you don’t lose hope yourself? Jesus
      forgives—and heals.

     Gambling
       Though the Bible doesn’t come right out and prohibit gambling per
     se, it’s hard to imagine Jesus or Paul working the tables in Las Vegas,
     isn’t it?
       At the same time, Paul does warn against love of money, classing it
     as the root of all evil and the reason people have abandoned the faith
     (1 Tim. 6:10). For some, in their desire for wealth, gambling becomes
     the snare that Satan uses to seek to destroy them.

Read Matthew 25:15–30. How could one apply the teaching here to
     the problem of gambling, especially when the vast majority of
     people who gamble lose?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       Gambling is for losers. The industry thrives because a lot more
     money is lost than won. What, for instance, are the chances of win-
     ning the lottery? The odds are staggeringly against you. You have
     more chance of getting hit by lightning than you do of winning.
       Logic alone should warn us against putting any money and time
     into gambling (after all, the gambling industry can exist only when
     people lose more than they make). Yet, people gamble, and soon what
     they thought of as fun later becomes a compulsion.
       Why? Self-esteem needs seem to be at the core. Many find a special
     satisfaction in fantasizing about winning. When they do not win, they
     become increasingly hopeful about hitting it next time. So, they gam-
     ble again and again. When all money is spent, they borrow, lie, and
     may steal in order to get another “dose” of this nonchemical “drug.”
       We may think that gambling addiction does not happen in our
     church, but Ellen White wrote about it in her time, for it was a problem
     even then. There is no reason to believe that today (when gambling is
     ubiquitous) our church members are free from this problem, especially
     as online gambling can bring the casino right into our homes.
       Recovery from gambling takes a multiple front: First is to admit
     that you have a serious problem. Then you must quit at once but find
     refuge in a group (if available) in order to avoid relapse. Be alert
     and stay away from any stimulus that may entice you to gamble.
     Enhancing self-esteem also is necessary to avoid relapse. Most impor-
     tant, constant communion with God and clinging to His promises of
     healing is crucial when struggling with any temptation.
      What would you say and do if someone you know said to you, “I am
      hooked on gambling, and I just cannot quit”? What Bible promises
      could you point them to? See 1 Cor. 10:13 and 1 Pet. 4:1, 2.
                                                                         91

     The Love of Money
       “Put falsehood and lying far from me, give me neither poverty
     nor riches; [provide me only with the food I need;] lest, being full,
     I deny you, saying, ‘Who is the Lord?’ Or, being in want, I steal,
     and profane the name of my God” (Prov. 30:8, 9, NAB).

       The Bible does not limit the amount of money one should aim to
     have but warns against the wrong attitude toward money and posses-
     sions—such as covetousness and greed. A wrong outlook might make
     people obsessive, compulsive, and addicted to moneymaking (albeit
     honestly earned) or to the accumulation of possessions. These themes
     may occupy so much time and effort that they become false gods.
       Information technology has made things easier, but, at the same
     time, more risky for those prone to addiction. For example, private
     investors on the stock exchange now can perform their operations
     instantly over the Internet. In this setting, some easily are caught for
     endless hours in front of the computer, all in order to make money;
     this is not the same thing, however, as someone being a good steward
     by wisely and carefully investing money.

Read Mark 10:17–27. See also 1 Tim. 6:10 and Luke 12:15. What
     warning must we take away from these texts?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Such expressions as “the man’s face fell” and “he went away sad”
     (Mark 10:22, NIV) tell us that his love for wealth was greater than
     his love for the Master. Accumulation of money or material posses-
     sions is not good or bad in itself. It all depends on where the heart is
     (see Matt. 6:21). It becomes dangerous when it stands in the way of
     what should be the first goal: seeking the kingdom of God and His
     righteousness (vs. 33).
        The ship Chanunga, on its way from Liverpool to America, had a
     massive collision with a small vessel from Hamburg. Crowded with
     more than two hundred passengers, the ship sank a half hour after
     the crash. The Chanunga’s lifesaving boats were lowered in order to
     reach the shipwrecked persons, but only thirty-four were saved. Why
     such a small proportion? Almost all had seized their belts of gold and
     silver and tied them round their waists. Refusing to lose their money,
     they lost their lives (and their money) instead.

      Who doesn’t like money? The question you need to ask yourself
      is, “Do I control my desire for money, or does it control me?”

     Personal Image
     							
Read 1 Peter 3:3, 4. How different is what’s said there from what
   society teaches us?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Society has placed an excessive value on personal image. This is
     a weakness that has accompanied humans for their entire history.
     In our days, this emphasis on beauty and personal care has reached
     overwhelming proportions. The worldwide cosmetic industry alone is
     more than half of the global food retail market. In addition to cosmet-
     ics, many people spend endless resources on body building, facelifts,
     hair transplants, plastic surgery, special diets, and so on, all in order
     to improve their appearance.
        This intensive desire to become more beautiful also has the risk of
     becoming addictive. Some develop exercise addiction; others the addic-
     tion to eat a little less each time, to the point of endangering their lives.
     Others may become obsessed with their hair or skin, submitting them-
     selves to sophisticated, costly, and never-ending treatments.

How would you interpret Matthew 6:19–21 in the context we are
     looking at? How do the same principles apply?

        There is nothing wrong with being fit, clean, and nice-looking. It is
     the constant focus on these things that can draw our hearts to them to the
     point of letting them become idols. Jesus talked about the need to develop
     treasures in heaven, not on earth, where things do not last and may distract
     us from God’s kingdom. Indeed, there’s one thing about looks that you
     can be sure of: sooner or later, time and gravity will take them away.
        Like material resources, our bodies are a treasure entrusted to us,
     but we run a serious risk to make it an idol when our devotion to it
     becomes excessive. It’s not always easy to know when a line has been
     crossed; hence, the need for all of us to be careful in this regard.

      What kind of messages are we creating for our young people in
      the church in regard to personal image? What are we empha-
      sizing? In what subtle ways might we be sending wrong mes-
      sages? Bring your answer to class on Sabbath.

    Further Study: “Words and acts testify plainly what is in the heart. If
          vanity and pride, love of self and love of dress, fill the heart, the conversa-
          tion will be upon the fashions, the dress, and the appearance, but not on
          Christ or the kingdom of heaven. If envious feelings dwell in the heart,
          they will be manifested in words and acts. Those who measure them-
          selves by others, do as others do, and make no higher attainments, excus-
          ing themselves because of the faults and wrongs of others, are feeding on
          husks and will remain spiritual dwarfs as long as they gratify Satan by
1
          thus indulging their own unconsecrated feelings. Some dwell upon what
          they shall eat and drink, and wherewithal they shall be clothed. These
          thoughts flow out from the abundance of the heart, as though temporal
          things were the grand aim in life, the highest attainment. These persons
          forget the words of Christ: “ ‘Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His
          righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.’ ”—Ellen G.

           1 In class, go over your answer to Thursday’s final question.


           l
           2 Why is it so important not to be judgmental toward those

3
           who are struggling with an addiction of any kind? It’s easy to
           be judgmental, of course, but why should we be very careful in
           that regard?

           l3 Some addictions are deemed more socially acceptable than
           others, which could only add to their deception. After all, how
           many people enter treatment for addiction to wealth or power?
           How can we learn not to let societal values impact how we view
           these things?

           l
           4 However strong the grip of addiction could be in your life or
           in the life of someone you know, is there anything that the Lord
           can’t free us from? What is the key to allowing Christ to work in
           our lives so that we can have that victory? See Luke 9:23.

           l5 What kind of programs does your local church have that can
           help people who are struggling with addiction? What can your
           church do to help those who are in need? In what ways could
           programs such as these be powerful outreach tools, as well?

           l6 Read 1 Peter 4:1, 2. What is the Lord’s message to us here in
           regard to what is involved in overcoming sinful addictions?

Alive Again: Part 2
by Atte Helminen
   Pirkko was depressed and discouraged. Things weren’t going well in
her life. She felt as if she was in a pit from which she couldn’t escape.
One day she met an old friend, Jari, who is the local church elder in Salo,
Finland. They chatted for awhile, and he gave her some books to help her
deal with her depression. She was deeply impressed with the books, so
Jari gave her some videos and invited her to visit the church.
   When Pirkko walked into the small church hall and saw the people, she
thought, I don’t belong here! I’m so different! But the members welcomed
and loved her. She felt the Holy Spirit’s presence, and she felt at home.
   Pirkko’s lifestyle still bothered her, but the church members’ love made
it easy for her to return. Pirkko invited her daughters to attend church with
her, and they came. In time Pirkko and her daughters embraced Christ and
were baptized into the Seventh-day Adventist Church. “I have a long way
to go,” Pirkko says. “But God is leading in my life.”
   Marko was a self-proclaimed atheist. “Science was my religion, and
scientists were my gods,” he said. One day he met Pirkko’s daughter, and
the two chatted for some time. Then she invited him to church. He went
just to be polite.
   He was impressed with the love people showered on him. He continued
attending and realized that he felt good being there. His doubts over God’s
existence faded as God’s love flowed through the lives of the church
members. He asked to be baptized.
   When he invited his family to his baptism, they were surprised, for he
had often spoken against God. But several of them came and saw the dif-
ference that Jesus was making in his life. Marko shares his new faith with
his family, and several have come to church with him.
   “I thank God that I have found Him,” Marko says. ‘I know that if the
believers in this church hadn’t been so loving, I would still be an unbe-
liever. It took the fire of love to melt my heart.”
   The church in Salo is alive once more. It’s been reborn, the result of
prayerful changes in the lives of its members. It is, essentially, a church
replant, and as such needs financial support to carry on its ministries in the
community while it grows. Our mission offerings can help the members
revitalize and re-grow their church.

     Nature as a Source of
     Health


     Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 1:27–2:25; Genesis
     3; Jer. 10:12, 13; Ps. 19:1–7; Matt. 6:25–34; Psalm 104.

Memory Text: “The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies
     proclaim the work of his hands. Day after day they pour forth speech;
     night after night they display knowledge” (Psalm 19:1, 2, NIV).



     G
              od created Adam and Eve in His own image. What could be a
              more perfect inheritance? He then placed them in the Garden
              of Eden. What could be a more perfect setting? Both heredity
     and environment, then, were divinely balanced to produce and pre-
     serve perfect mental and physical health.
        Sin, however, ruined everything—and by the second generation
     jealousy, hatred, and violence contaminated the world. The natural
     environment also underwent the initial results of sin, and when sin
     became intolerable, the Flood changed forever the portrait of the
     earth.
        Yet, much goodness and beauty remain in the natural world. Nature
     still supplies sufficient resources to satisfy our basic needs. Nature
     also can provide joy, happiness, and well-being to compensate par-
     tially for the misery caused by sin.
        Thus, despite its sometimes violent and deadly convulsions, nature
     can be a source of mental and physical health. It also can become
     a means for us to draw ever closer to the Creator, the fount of all
     goodness: “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and
     cometh down from the Father of lights” (James 1:17).

     A Perfect Environment
        Today, living as we do in a world tainted and corrupted by sin, we can
     only imagine what it must have been like for our first parents in Eden. No
     sin, no suffering, no death—nothing to bring them the kind of sorrows
     and pain that we all know so well. In a sense, we’re so used to these reali-
     ties, they’re so common, that we forget that they all are intruders, things
     that were not in the original creation, things that were never meant to be,
     things that we are promised will one day be forever gone.

Read Genesis 1:27–2:25. What picture is presented about what life
     and the environment were like in Eden? How different is it from
     what we know today?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       The newly created couple was placed in a garden that God Himself
     had planted (Gen. 2:8). Although the biblical account is brief, imagine
     when we consider the wonderful bounties nature provides for us
     today, the luxurious mix of produce that must have come from this,
     the first garden. Their senses were exposed to sights, sounds, tastes,
     feelings, and aromas that certainly brought much satisfaction and
     well-being to our first parents. It truly was Paradise.
       There is no doubt that the environment was the best to suit the newly
     created humans. Their physical, emotional, and mental needs were more
     than met. Mental states such as uncertainty, anxiety, and worry were
     completely unknown, because there was nothing there to cause them.
       “The Creator chose for our first parents the surroundings best
     adapted for their health and happiness. He did not place them in a
     palace or surround them with the artificial adornments and luxuries
     that so many today are struggling to obtain. . . . In the garden that
     God prepared as a home for His children, graceful shrubs and deli-
     cate flowers greeted the eye at every turn. There were trees of every
     variety, many of them laden with fragrant and delicious fruit. On their
     branches the birds caroled their songs of praise. Under their shadow
     the creatures of the earth sported together without a fear.”—Ellen G.
     White, The Ministry of Healing, p. 261.

      Try to envision what Eden must have been like. Think of the
      sights, the smells, the tastes, everything designed to appeal to
      our senses. What should that tell us about how, in principle, our
      physical bodies are good and were made for us to enjoy?
                                                                             97

     Sin and Nature
       Whatever wonder and beauty we can find in nature, it’s today a double-
     edged sword. Beauty and marvel are there, but so are famine, earth-
     quakes, pestilence, and disease. Something has gone terribly wrong.

Read over Genesis 3, the Fall. What immediate changes came to both
     humans and nature as a result of sin?


        Sin brought immediate physical and spiritual consequences to human
     life. Nature, too, suffered the effects of sin. Sin caused devastating
     effects upon creation in at least three ways:

      • The ground was cursed (Gen. 3:17). After departing from the Garden
        of Eden, Adam and Eve encountered immediate obstacles in working
        the soil. The ground began to produce undesirable thorns and thistles.
        Pests, most probably, got in the way of healthy growth too. Things got
        worse after the devastation of the Flood.

      • Human beings experienced significant changes. Fatigue and pain
        became a reality. The relationship between the man and the woman
        changed. The chapter seems to imply that Eve would have originally
        not had pain in childbirth. The relationship of Adam to the earth
        had changed, as well, and work now was going to be much more
        difficult than it would have been before. We do not know how the
        awareness of their own impending deaths affected the first couple,
        but it must have changed their outlook on life completely.

      • Sin affected human and animal behavior. Hatred, jealousy, selfish-
        ness, arrogance, etc., caused aggression against fellow humans and
        animals. Other unknown ways of damaging the environment (per-
        haps comparable to what we are witnessing today) may have taken
        place. Animals started to kill each other for food and for power.
        As described in Genesis 3–6, corruption and violence escalated to
        the point that God was grieved for having made all creatures (Gen.
        6:5–7).

       The true extent of all these transformations is not revealed to us,
     but we can assume that profound changes took place. Yet, God, in
     His infinite mercy, preserved a great deal of the magnificent original
     creation for the benefit of human beings.

      Look around at the wonders of nature wherever you are. What
      echoes of the original creation seem to remain? What hope can
      you draw from those echoes that point you to the promises of
      a better world?

     God’s Gifts Through Nature
       The natural world presents a powerful testimony to not only the
     existence of God but also His power. Sadly, as Paul warned, humans
     (no doubt inspired by Satan) turned away from the living God and
     worshiped the creation instead of its Creator (see Rom. 1:19–25).

Read Jeremiah 10:12, 13. What picture is presented here of God’s
     creative power and His present involvement in natural phenom-
     ena? What can we learn about the character of God through His
     created works?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       Of course, as we all know, nature sometimes turns against us,
     spreading horror through earthquakes, volcanoes, floods, etc. Why
     these tragedies happen when and where they do are questions that
     we don’t have answers for now. What we do know, however, is that
     the first few chapters in the book of Job reveal the reality of the great
     controversy between God and Satan and that Satan can use the forces
     of nature for evil purposes. And despite these terrible calamities, the
     goodness of God still can be seen in the natural world.

Read Psalm 19:1–6, and then in your own words paraphrase its basic
     message.

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Nature traditionally has been seen by Seventh-day Adventists as
     God’s second book. Observation and study of the natural world, if
     done in humility and openness to the influence of the Holy Spirit, will
     deepen faith and trust in God. It also will provide additional under-
     standing into God’s love for His creatures. This can be a great source
     of mental and spiritual comfort. Sometimes, when all else fails, the
     beauty of nature, and what it testifies to us about God, can be a source
     of great comfort and hope.

      If while you are witnessing to someone about God’s goodness
      (especially as revealed in nature) the person brings up the ques-
      tion of tsunamis, earthquakes, famines, and the like, how would
      you respond? What does the reality of these natural disasters tell
      us about the limits of what nature can teach us about God?
                                                                          99

      Communion With God in Nature
        		
        “ ‘Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not,
      neither do they spin’ ” (Matt. 6:28).

        A young man, an atheist his whole life, was converted in his early
      twenties. Right after his new birth, he lived for a number of months in a
      country setting, and he would often wander in the woods, marveling at
      the wonders of the God who had created such beauty. Of course, he had
      seen wonderful things in the natural world before, but only now was he
      able to see the character of the Lord who had created it all. It was, he said,
      “as if my eyes were opened for the first time in my whole life!” It was
      during that time that this new Christian came to truly know the Lord.

Read Matthew 6:25–34. What is Jesus telling us that we can learn
      from studying nature?
      ________________________________________________________
      ________________________________________________________

         No question, we indeed can learn many valuable spiritual lessons
      from the study of the created world. But nature can work to our advan-
      tage spiritually in another way, as well. Luke 5:16 says that Jesus “with-
      drew himself into the wilderness, and prayed,” something that Ellen
      White said Jesus did often. Sometimes we, too, need to get away from
      everything and just be alone with the Lord in a natural environment.
      The beauty, the comfort, the peace, the serenity that one often finds in
      the natural world can speak to our hearts and minds in ways that noth-
      ing else does. There might not be any sudden revelation of new truth;
      there might be no new insights on a doctrine or a text. What there can
      be, instead, is an unspoken recognition of the love and power of the One
      who created all this. However we might individually experience the
      Lord this way, there’s no question that time alone in nature, in commu-
      nion with God, can bring healing and peace to our bodies and souls.
         “All who are under the training of God need the quiet hour for com-
      munion with their own hearts, with nature, and with God. In them is to
      be revealed a life that is not in harmony with the world, its customs,
      or its practices; and they need to have a personal experience in obtain-
      ing a knowledge of the will of God. We must individually hear Him
      speaking to the heart. When every other voice is hushed, and in quiet-
      ness we wait before Him, the silence of the soul makes more distinct
      the voice of God.”—Ellen G. White, The Ministry of Healing, p. 58.

       When was the last time you communed with the Lord in nature?
       If possible, make an effort to do just that. You might be sur-
       prised at what a positive spiritual effect it will have.

     Psalm 104
       In the nineteenth century, a popular belief known as deism stated that
     God had created the world but then left it alone. In other words, accord-
     ing to this position, God exists but doesn’t want to get involved.
       That view, however, is not what the Bible teaches. God didn’t just
     set the world like a wind-up watch and then let it go, come what may.
     According to the Bible, He’s intricately involved in all that happens
     here. After all, what is the Cross if not God intimately and directly
     involved in human affairs?

Read Psalm 104 prayerfully. What does it tell us about the role of
     God in creation and in the natural world?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Perhaps the most telling thing about Psalm 104 is the enthusiasm
     and excitement that exude from the words themselves. The psalmist
     rejoices in the creative and sustaining power of the Lord. You almost
     can hear him shouting out these words in praise and adoration. He
     sees the reality of God in the everyday function of the natural world.
        The God presented in this psalm is not the god of the deists either.
     He’s a God who is involved in what happens here. No doubt, what-
     ever the psalmist’s personal troubles, he finds comfort and hope in the
     power of the Lord. Sure, contemplating the birds in their nests or the
     lions seeking their food isn’t going to solve whatever daily struggles
     he’s facing, but he can see in nature things that speak to him of God’s
     goodness and power, and that gives him hope.
        Nature also can be a source of healing to the body, mind, and spirit.
     In many cases fresh air, sunlight, water, and a healthy diet can do
     wonders for us both physically and mentally. Natural remedies remain
     a powerful means of health and healing.
        Some doctors, too, often will tell people to get away from work
     and stress and find rest and relaxation in a natural setting somewhere.
     Some research shows just how good nature and a natural environment
     can be for us physically and mentally. After all, God put our first par-
     ents in a garden, not in a city square. Something in us resonates better
     with a field of lilies than it does with an asphalt parking lot.

      Nature is one of God’s great gifts. We should do all that we can
      to take advantage of it. What are ways you can benefit better
      from what God has given us in nature?
                                                                         101

    Further Study: “The home of our first parents was to be a pattern
          for other homes as their children should go forth to occupy the earth.
          That home, beautified by the hand of God Himself, was not a gor-
          geous palace. Men, in their pride, delight in magnificent and costly
          edifices and glory in the works of their own hands; but God placed
          Adam in a garden. This was his dwelling. The blue heavens were its
          dome; the earth, with its delicate flowers and carpet of living green,
          was its floor; and the leafy branches of the goodly trees were its can-
          opy. Its walls were hung with the most magnificent adornings—the
          handiwork of the great Master Artist. In the surroundings of the holy
1         pair was a lesson for all time—that true happiness is found, not in the
          indulgence of pride and luxury, but in communion with God through
          His created works. If men would give less attention to the artificial,
          and would cultivate greater simplicity, they would come far nearer to
          answering the purpose of God in their creation.”—Ellen G. White,
          Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 49, 50.
2            “The constant contact with the mystery of life and the loveliness of
          nature, as well as the tenderness called forth in ministering to these beau-
          tiful objects of God’s creation, tends to quicken the mind and refine and
          elevate the character.”—Ellen G. White, The Adventist Home, p. 143.

    Discussion Questions:
           l
           1 How can we make sure that we don’t cross the line from being

3
           a lover of nature to a worshiper of it? How might that not always
           be an easy distinction to draw? However wonderful nature is, we
           always must remember that in the end it can’t save us. Only the
           God who created nature can. Why is it important to always keep
           that crucial truth in mind?

           l2 What should we as Seventh-day Adventists have to say in
           regard to the whole question of the environment? What, if any-
           thing in our teaching, could be a helpful and needed component
           in this important question? At the same time, how should we
           respond to the following idea: “Well, we know the Lord is com-
           ing soon, and this whole world will be destroyed and then made
           over, so is the environment really that important?”

           l3 In what ways today should all the incredible advancements
           in scientific and natural knowledge help increase our love of and
           appreciation for the power of God? Think of all the things we
           know about the natural world today that the ancients had no
           inkling of. Thus, in what ways do we have so many more advan-
           tages than they ever did in regard to be able to marvel at the

The Lighthouse in the
Darkness
by Francis Ahisson
   The delegates from a Protestant church walked out of the Seventh-day
Adventist mission office in Benin, West Africa, talking excitedly. They
had come to ask the Adventist officials to teach them the Bible, and the
mission president agreed to teach them.
   On the appointed day many came to hear the Adventist pastor teach
them about God. Following the meetings, a congregation was established
and a temporary chapel was built to house the worshipers until a more
permanent building could be erected.
   The church’s membership grew to some 60 people as the congregation
struggled against the powers of Satan and voodoo worship, which domi-
nates the people of this region. Most of the church members earn a living by
fishing or doing unskilled labor, so they don’t earn much money. They sac-
rifice to buy cement blocks for the day when they can build their church.
   One woman in the church became seriously ill, and local doctors
couldn’t help her. Her husband took her to a large city hospital where
doctors said she had a tumor and needed surgery. But her husband didn’t
have the money for the surgery, so he took his wife home, fearful that
she would die. He did the only thing he knew to do: he called the church
leaders to pray for her.
   That night the woman awoke and saw an angel in her room. The angel
touched her and said, “God has sent me to heal you.” The woman awoke,
wondering at her dream. Then she heard a voice tell her, “Stand up and
walk.” She hadn’t been able to stand or walk for several weeks, but she
stood and took several steps.
   The next day the doctor couldn’t find the tumor. He called his colleagues
to examine her, and they too could find nothing wrong with her. “Your
tumor is gone,” he said. The woman told him about the angel’s visit.
   News spread through the village that the woman had been healed. The
church members rejoiced with her. Her healing has increased the faith of
many people in her church and throughout the town. Many people visited
the church, wanting to see what kind of church is powerful enough to heal
people. And the members gladly gave God the credit for this healing.
   Your mission offerings will help this little church in Benin shine the
light of God across a country saturated with the darkness of voodoo and
witchcraft.

      I
          n recent years, research has pointed to the positive effects that reli-
          giosity, faith, spirituality, prayer, forgiveness, hope, and church
          attendance can have on health, including mental health. Numerous
      prominent scientific publications have reported a connection between
      religious faith and positive mental and emotional well-being. Surprise
      of surprises!
         Yet, this is not magic; the faith factor applies only to those who are
      deeply committed to their religious principles. Psychiatrist Montagu
      Barker, an expert in the interface between religion and mental health,
      states that religion is a potent safeguard against mental illness, but
      only when believers possess a strong commitment to their beliefs. If
      not, religion may become a source of guilt and the cause of emotional,
      mental, and behavioral disturbances.
         This week we will look at our best Example, Jesus, to learn how we
      can be strong in faith. By studying His life and maintaining a close
      relationship with Him, we can build solid mechanisms for spiritual
      growth, which itself can lead to better mental health.
         Prayer and Bible study, worship, the practice of forgiveness, service
      to others, and hope and trust in God are sure pathways to spiritual
      development and mental health. With Jesus as our Example, we
      surely can’t go wrong.

     The Praying Lord
Read Mark 1:21–35 and Luke 4:31–42. What lessons can you learn
     about His habits of prayer? What should this say to us about our
     need to pray?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Jesus is found going to the synagogue on that Sabbath in Capernaum,
     teaching the Scriptures to an amazed group of people who recognized
     His authority and that He healed a demon-possessed man. After
     the meeting, Jesus and His disciples went to the house of Peter and
     Andrew, and there He healed Peter’s mother-in-law. At sunset, many
     (“the whole town” [Mark 1:33, NIV]) congregated around Jesus and
     brought all sorts of ill and demon-possessed to be healed.
        “Never before had Capernaum witnessed a day like this. The air was
     filled with the voice of triumph and shouts of deliverance. Not until the
     last sufferer had been relieved did Jesus cease His work. It was far into
     the night when the multitude departed and silence settled down upon
     the home of Simon.”—Ellen G. White, Lift Him Up, p. 86.
        That must have been an exhausting day for Jesus. However, He did
     not sleep late the next morning. He needed to be in communion with His
     Father; so He got up before dawn, went to a solitary place, and spent time
     in prayer. Jesus, the Son of God, He who had been with the Father before
     the world began (John 17:5), He who had created the entire universe (John
     1:3), nevertheless felt the need for prayer. The concept is remarkable.
        After stressful days, we tend to postpone prayer and communion with
     God. But it is precisely during those moments of psychological drain that
     we most need the soothing balm of prayer and time in the Word of God.
     Jesus knew this and practiced consistent closeness with His Father. If this
     was necessary for Jesus, how much more should it be for us?
        Prayer is a positive factor in well-being and mental health. However
     much we don’t understand about prayer, about how it works or even about
     why it works, we are admonished to pray (Luke 18:1, 21:36, Rom. 12:12).
     Who hasn’t felt the positive impact this can have on our spirit and mind
     when spending time in communion with the Lord through prayer and read-
     ing the Word? We don’t have to understand all the mysteries of prayer in
     order to know how crucial it is to have a close relationship with God.

      What kind of prayer life do you have? How much time do you
      spend in the Word of God? What are ways you can make your
      devotional time more meaningful and life-changing? However
      important that we spend time in prayer and reading the Word,
      time alone isn’t the only element. What other factors are needed?
                                                                           105

      Worship and Church Community
        Jesus went regularly to the synagogue on Sabbath (Luke 4:16). His
      example should speak to us of the importance of community. The
      concept of “a lone Christian,” independent of the body, is not biblical.
      That there are some occasional examples of this in the Bible doesn’t
      prove that this is God’s plan. All through the Scriptures we see the
      model of God’s people as a community, a group working together for
      the mutual benefit of each other and for the church as a whole.

Read 1 Corinthians 12:12–31 and Ephesians 4:15, 16. What do these
      verses tell us about our role and place in a larger church com-
      munity?


        How interesting, too, that in recent years reputable studies are
      showing that those who attend and participate in church services
      (compared to those who don’t) on a regular basis are: 			

        • less likely to suffer from substance abuse
        • more likely to be sexually responsible
        • less involved in risky behaviors
        • more likely to practice business and work-related ethics
        • more likely to enjoy a richer social network and group support
        • more likely to display higher levels of self-esteem and personal
          efficacy
        • more likely to cope better with losses (death of dear ones, calami-
          ties, health complications, et cetera)
        • more likely to harbor positive emotions (love, forgiveness, con-
          tentment, et cetera)
        • less likely to harbor negative emotions (guilt, fear, hostility,
          anger, et cetera).

         Belonging to a church can be a great source of blessing. Such an envi-
      ronment can be therapeutic for soul and body. True, at times problems
      arise in the community, and some leave angry and bitter; but more often
      than not, those who work through their problems can find in the church
      support and fellowship and encouragement that they might not get
      anywhere else. Think about what church could be like if every member
      took to heart these words from Paul: “Carry each other’s burdens, and
      in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ” (Gal. 6:2, NIV).

       What is your relationship to your local church body? Are you a
       giver or a taker? Why, at times, might you need to be a taker?
       At the same time, if we all went to church with the attitude of
       giving ourselves when and where we could, what kind of com-
       munity would we have?

     Forgiveness
       “ ‘Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do’ ”
     (Luke 23:34).

Read Matthew 6:14, 15. What powerful message is Jesus giving to
     us here? What is He saying that is so full of eternal consequence
     for all of us?
     ________________________________________________________

        Jesus taught His disciples to pray: “ ‘Forgive us our debts, as we also
     have forgiven our debtors’ ” (vs. 12, NIV). Then He insisted (vss. 14, 15)
     that if we do not wish to forgive, God will not forgive us.
        The thought is terrifying. After all, we all are sinners; and thus, we all
     need divine forgiveness. Thus, we all must learn to forgive if we want to
     be forgiven ourselves!
        Forgiveness is so important because it’s foundational in repairing and
     maintaining good relationships. The Lord knows how painful the burden
     of sin is and how its burden must be released through forgiveness—
     through the forgiveness that we get from God and through the forgive-
     ness we give to others.
        The experience of forgiveness is helpful, not only to those receiv-
     ing it but also to those granting it. The feeling of grace and generosity
     experienced by those granting forgiveness brings them closer to God and
     contributes to character building.
        A study conducted among recently divorced individuals showed the
     difference between those willing and those unwilling to forgive. Mark
     Rye of the University of Iowa recruited 199 divorced individuals from
     community singles’ organizations and church-based divorce recovery
     groups. Not surprisingly, researchers found that those who extended for-
     giveness to their former spouses enjoyed higher levels of mental health.
     When compared to those unwilling to forgive, forgiving persons expe-
     rienced higher levels of well-being and religious satisfaction and lower
     levels of anger and depression.
        This is not an isolated experience. Studies over the past decade are
     clear. Forgiveness reduces depression and anxiety and increases self-
     esteem and overall emotional well-being. In sum, forgiveness is good for
     many things; holding grudges, meanwhile, is dangerous for body and soul.
       Is this so unexpected? Who among us hasn’t experienced the healing
     and relief that come from offering forgiveness to those who have hurt
     us?

      How can you practice Paul’s counsel: “Bear with each other and
      forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another.
      Forgive as the Lord forgave you” (Col. 3:13, NIV)? What choices
      must you make in order to forgive those who have hurt you?
                                                                             107

      Service
         The Seventh-day Adventist outreach to the world historically has
      held two basic branches of ministry: teaching/preaching and healing/
      helping. They represent the two major tasks of Jesus’ ministry (see
      Matt. 9:35 and Acts 10:38). Furthermore, for many people through-
      out the world, Seventh-day Adventists are known by their health and
      humanitarian work.
         At the same time, these powerful branches have become quite institu-
      tionalized in many places. As a result, the ordinary member may fail to
      engage directly in these ministries. Some provide financial support; oth-
      ers leave these ministries to the professionals; and some, unfortunately,
      even view them with indifference. In the end, many do not become
      directly involved in the task of going “around doing good” and thus
      miss a tremendous blessing. Why? Because there is a great personal
      blessing that comes from ministering to the needs of others. The simple
      practice of directly sharing with the needy or of helping someone who
      is sick or of attentively listening to others’ problems will result in great
      blessing to the one doing the ministering. There’s something wired in
      us, something not totally eradicated by six thousand years of sin, that
      makes us feel good, even whole, when we serve others.

Read Matthew 25:34–46. What is Jesus saying to us here? What does
      this mean in the light of Ephesians 2:8, 9?

      ________________________________________________________

      ________________________________________________________

        Salvation cannot be by works. If it were, nobody would be saved.
      God’s grace manifested by the sacrifice of Jesus in our behalf is the
      only means of salvation. At the same time, personal acceptance of
      God’s grace does produce good works, and these works reveal the
      reality of our walk with God. The good works we do should be a
      direct result of knowing that we already have salvation in Jesus, as a
      result of His works for us. Works are the natural outgrowth of being
      saved, not a means of getting saved. How crucial that we keep that
      important distinction always before us.
        Meanwhile, there’s a tremendous emotional and spiritual blessing
      for those who, out of thankfulness to God for the salvation they have
      in Jesus, give of themselves to others. Many people struggling with
      emotional issues would feel so much better merely by directing their
      thoughts away from themselves and onto others.

       Unhappy, unsatisfied? Most likely it’s because you’re too self-
       absorbed. Get involved in helping others and see what happens.

     Hope and Trust in God
       “Be strong and take heart, all you who hope in the Lord” (Ps.
     31:24, NIV). What reasons do we have for putting our hope in the
     Lord?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

        Studies show that hope is a critical factor in mental health. An atti-
     tude of hope found in hostages makes a difference in survival. Hope
     is a great motivator and a source of mental and physical endurance.
     Most depression treatments work well in patients convinced that their
     mood can improve significantly and that they can be helped. Indeed,
     depression and anxiety often afflict those whose outlook on life is
     pessimistic, catastrophic, and hopeless. A hopeful attitude can make a
     big difference in our entire mental outlook.
        But there is more than the general hope that whatever your pres-
     ent trial is, it will end well. Religious hope transcends the finite and
     focuses on the eternal. It points us to realities and truths and promises
     that the world, in and of itself, can never offer. It’s a hope found in
     the Creator God, who alone can give us what nothing else in the world
     can.

Read Matthew 26:36–44. What can we learn about trusting in God,
     even in terrible times, from Jesus’ example here?

     ________________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

       The passage tells us of the Savior’s disheartened state. Carefully
     chosen words are used to describe Jesus’ painful emotions: troubled,
     exceedingly sorrowful (deeply distressed). Heartbroken and disre-
     garded by His friends, He fell not only on His knees but on His face
     and asked His Father for relief. When relief did not come, He asked
     again. And again. Note that every time He posed His request, He
     asked for God’s will to be done. In the end, Jesus put all His trust in
     the Father. Regardless of what would happen, He sought to be surren-
     dered to His Father. That was His way, and it must be ours, as well.

      It’s one thing to trust in the Lord in good times. But how can
      we learn to trust Him in bad times? How do we learn to trust
      when our prayers are not answered as we wish?

                                                                         109

    Further Study: “We must individually hear Him speaking to the
          heart. When every other voice is hushed, and in quietness we wait
          before Him, the silence of the soul makes more distinct the voice of
          God. He bids us, ‘Be still, and know that I am God.’ Ps. 46:10. Here
          alone can true rest be found. And this is the effectual preparation
          for all who labor for God. Amid the hurrying throng, and the strain
          of life’s intense activities, the soul that is thus refreshed will be sur-
          rounded with an atmosphere of light and peace. The life will breathe
1         out fragrance, and will reveal a divine power that will reach men’s
          hearts.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 363.
             “Every ray of light shed upon others will be reflected upon our own
          hearts. Every kind and sympathizing word spoken to the sorrowful,
          every act to relieve the oppressed, and every gift to supply the neces-
          sities of our fellow beings, given or done with an eye to God’s glory,
2         will result in blessings to the giver. Those who are thus working are
          obeying a law of heaven and will receive the approval of God. The
          pleasure of doing good to others imparts a glow to the feelings which
          flashes through the nerves, quickens the circulation of the blood, and
          induces mental and physical health.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies
          for the Church, vol. 4, p. 56.

           2 What has been your own experience with your local church
           community? How can you improve that experience? How can
           you work with your church to make it a place where all people
           would feel comfortable coming, where all people could be wel-
           comed, where all people could learn about salvation and the
           present truth message we have for the world? In what areas is
           your church strong, and in what areas must it improve?

No Longer Alone
   Alima felt lost and alone. Painfully shy, she spent most of her time at
home. Often, as she cleaned the family’s small house, she would pause at
her father’s picture and cry, “Why did you leave us? If you loved us, you
wouldn’t have died!”
   Only later did her mother reveal that her father had died in a drunken
brawl. When Alima realized that alcohol had caused her father’s death,
she vowed never to touch it.
   Like many in Mongolia, Alima believed that the deities had drawn
her life’s destiny, and she must follow the path set for her. But often she
pleaded, “Why did you make my path so hard? Why must I go through
this suffering?”
   One day as Alima walked across her small town, she met two foreign
women. They smiled and greeted her. They talked for some time, and then
they invited her to attend a seminar on healthful living. Alima liked the
women and agreed to attend the seminar.
   Alima found much to agree with in the health seminar—especially the
dangers of alcohol. As she learned more about healthful living, she also
learned about God. The two Christian women invited her to learn more
about Jesus, who hears and answers her prayers. Again, Alima accepted.
   Alima read the Bible with these two young women and listened to their
explanation of God’s love. They invited her to evangelistic meetings, and
there Alima learned more about this God who loves her so much that He
died for her. His love offered her a better life, but He would never force
her to follow His plan for her. Alima accepted God’s love and took her
stand to follow His path.
   She invited her sisters to attend church with her, and they went. Her
mother doesn’t yet attend the Seventh-day Adventist Church, but Alima
and her sisters pray that one day she will come.
   Alima’s shyness disappeared as she grew confident of God’s love. In
its place was born a desire to tell others that they can be free from fears if
they follow God’s perfect plan for their lives.
   Alima became a short-term missionary, serving in a large city in
Mongolia. “I praise God that He cares enough about a lonely and troubled
little girl to send someone to teach me about Jesus. Now I can teach others
and bring them hope too.”

 Your mission offerings help establish groups of believers in Mongolia,
where just over 2,000 believers share His love with others.

2011    Bible Study Guide for the Second Quarter

          Next quarter’s Bible study guide, Garments of Grace: Clothing
       Imagery in the Bible, by the Office of the Adult Bible Study Guide
       staff, will focus on the biblical symbolism of clothing imagery.
       From the fanciful adornment of Lucifer in heaven to the filthy rags
       of our own righteousness, the Bible uses clothing and clothing
       imagery to portray truths about sin, pride, righteousness, salvation,
       justification, resurrection, and eternal life in Christ. This study
       will examine the garments that people wore and what that clothing
       really meant, what truths they symbolized, what great realities they
       pointed to, and what lessons we can learn from them.

       Memory Text—Ezekiel 28:15
       Sabbath Gem: What this text shows is that, in God’s universe, the
       concept of “perfect” includes freedom, moral freedom, and the ability to
       choose right and wrong. Lucifer abuses the freedom given to him and
       falls away from the Lord. What can we learn from this tragic mistake?
