              The Adult Sabbath School Bible Study Guide is prepared by the Office of
              the Adult Bible Study Guide of the General Conference of Seventh-day
              Adventists. The preparation of the guides is under the general direction
              of the Sabbath School Publications Board, a subcommittee of the General
Sabbath
              Conference Administrative Committee (ADCOM), publisher of the Bible
 School       study guides. The published guide reflects the input of worldwide evaluation
Personal      committees and the approval of the Sabbath School Publications Board and
Ministries    thus does not solely or necessarily represent the intent of the author(s).

                                                                                        1
“And Worship Him . . .”

S         ome of the most well-known verses among Seventh-day Adventists are
          these: “And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the
          everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every
nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God,
and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that
made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters” (Rev. 14:6, 7).
And though we view them in the context of last-day events, they also help form the
foundation for our topic this quarter, which is worship. Not only are we called to
worship, but we can, in these verses, find key themes to help us understand what
true worship should be about.
   First, John sees an angel having the “everlasting gospel,” the gospel of the ever-
lasting covenant, the good news that Jesus Christ would come, take upon Himself
humanity, and in that humanity die as a Substitute for the sins of the world.
Foundational, then, to all our worship needs to be Jesus’ death in our behalf.
Worship should center on our response to the substitutionary work of Christ,
which includes not only the Cross but His ongoing ministry for us in the heavenly
sanctuary (Heb. 8:1).
   Next, John tells us to “fear God.” Fearing God and loving God are two sides of
the same coin: to fear God is to stand in awe, in reverence for who He is as Creator
and Redeemer, in contrast to whom we are as the created and the redeemed. When
we approach God in worship as a kind of buddy or pal, we degrade Him and place
ourselves in a role in which we do not belong. Worship should be permeated by a
sense of reverence and awe for our God, an attitude that will give us the humility
and surrender so needed for true worship.
   We are also told to “give glory to Him.” What is crucial here is that worship
be about God and not about ourselves. We have to make sure that worship is not
people-centered, culture-centered, or personal-needs-centered, but God-centered.
We worship God, not ourselves; hence, worship must
be about Him, about giving glory to Him, and not
about music, culture, or worship styles.
                                                               Worship should be
   We are told to fear God and give glory to Him. Why?         permeated by a
Because “the hour of his judgment [has] come.” Christ          sense of reverence
is not only the Redeemer. He is also the Judge, a Judge        and awe for our
who knows all our deepest and darkest secrets, a Judge
                                                               God, an attitude
who knows the innermost recesses of our hearts. As we
worship, we need to do so with the sense of an account-        that will give us
ability to God for what we do and a realization that we        the humility and
can hide nothing from Him, a fact that should drive us         surrender so needed
to the Cross, our only hope in this judgment.                  for true worship.
   Finally, we are told to worship the Creator. Creation is
so foundational to all worship, because all that we believe,
without exception, is based on the fact that God is Creator. We worship Him because
He is Creator and because He is Redeemer and because He is Judge. Creation and
Redemption and judgment are closely tied, and all true worship needs to be firmly
rooted in these objective theological truths. How fascinating, too, that in Revelation
14:7 we find language reflecting the Sabbath commandment (Exod. 20:11), a day
inseparably linked to the true worship of God.
   This quarter, as we study worship, these motifs will appear again and again, for
they are central to what true worship should be about. And with worship as such a
central component of “present truth,” we would do well to learn what it means to
truly worship the only One in all creation who, by virtue of who He is, is worthy
of that worship.

      Worship in Genesis: Two
      Classes of Worshipers




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 3:1–13, 4:1–4, Titus
      1:2, Gen. 6:1–8, 12:1–8, 22:1–18, 28:10–22.

Memory Text: “ ‘Surely the Lord is in this place, and I did not
      know it.’ And he was afraid and said, ‘How awesome is this place!
      This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of
      heaven!’ ” (Genesis 28:16, 17, NKJV).



      I
          t has been said that, as human beings, we need to worship
          something. What we worship . . . well, that is a different matter,
          though it is one fraught with exceedingly important consequences,
      especially in the last days, when two groups of worshipers are made
      manifest: those who worship the Creator and those who worship the
      beast and his image.
         Yet, the seeds for that contrast can be seen early on in the Bible.
      In the story of Cain and Abel, two kinds of worshipers appear, one
      worshiping the true God as He is supposed to be worshiped and one
      engaging in a false kind of worship. One is acceptable, one is not, and
      that is because one is based on salvation by faith and the other, as are
      all false forms of worship, is based on works. It is a motif that will
      appear again and again throughout the Bible. One type of worship is
      focused solely on God, on His power and glory and grace, the other
      on humanity and on self.

      Worship in Eden
        Genesis 1 records the story of Adam and Eve in their new home.
      The Creator of the universe had just designed and formed a beautiful
      new planet, crowning His work with the creation of the first family.
      The world came from Him perfect; in its own unique way, earth must
      have been an extension of heaven.
        Genesis 2:1–3 then adds another element: the setting apart and
      making holy of the seventh day, an act tied directly to His work of
      creating the heavens and the earth, the act that forms the foundation
      of the fourth commandment—a day set aside for worship in a special
      way. Though Scripture does not say, one could imagine the kind of
      worship that these sinless beings, in the perfection of creation, gave to
      their Maker, who had done so much for them. (Little did they know, at
      that time, just how much He would end up really doing for them!)

Read the tragic story of the Fall in Genesis 3:1–13. What changes now
      took place in Adam’s relationship to his Creator? Vss. 8–10. How
      did Adam respond to God’s questions to him? Vss. 11–13. What
      does his response reveal about what had happened to him?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         After the Fall a whole lot of elements that certainly were not there
      before suddenly appeared. Just like that, in a moment of disobedience,
      the entire moral fabric of these beings changed. Instead of love, trust,
      and adoration, their hearts were now filled with fear, guilt, and shame.
      Instead of desiring His holy presence, they hid from Him. For Adam
      and Eve, their relationship with God, which surely impacted how they
      worshiped Him, had been shattered. The close and intimate commu-
      nion with God they once enjoyed (Gen. 3:8) would now take a dif-
      ferent form. Indeed, when God came to them, they “hid themselves”
      from His presence. So full were they of shame, guilt, even fear, they
      fled from the One who had created them.
         What a powerful image of just what sin did—and still does—to
      us.

       Think about times in your life when some experience, perhaps
       some sin, made you feel guilt, shame, and the desire to hide
       from God. How did this affect your prayer life? What did it do
       to your ability to worship Him with your whole heart? Not a
       pleasant feeling, is it?
                                                                             7

     Worship Outside of Eden
       After their expulsion, Adam and Eve began life outside the Eden
     paradise. Though the first gospel promise was given them there, in
     Eden (Gen. 3:15), the Bible does not show us any sacrifices being
     offered until after Eden (although one could extrapolate from Genesis
     3:21 something of that nature, the text itself says nothing about
     sacrifice or worship). In Genesis 4, however, with the story of Cain
     and Abel, Genesis for the first time explicitly reveals a sacrificial
     system.

Read carefully the first recorded story of a worship service (Gen.
     4:1–7). Why did God reject Cain’s offering and accept Abel’s?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Cain and Abel represent two classes of worshipers that have existed
     since the Fall. Both of them built altars. Both came to worship God with
     offerings. But one offering was acceptable to God and one was not.
        What made the difference? The answer has to be understood in the
     context of salvation by faith alone, the gospel, which was first given
     to Adam and Eve in Eden, though the plan itself was formulated
     before the world began (Eph. 1:4, Titus 1:2).
        Cain’s offering represented the attempt at salvation by works, the
     foundation of all false religion and worship. The fact is that the gap
     between heaven and earth is so great, so deep, that nothing sinful
     humans do could ever bridge it. The essence of legalism, of salvation
     by works, is the human attempt to do just that.
        In contrast, Abel’s offering of an animal reveals (however faintly)
     the great truth that only the death of Christ, the One equal with God
     (Phil. 2:6), could make the sinner right with God.
        Hence, we are given a powerful lesson about worship: all true
     worship must center on the realization that we are helpless to save
     ourselves and that all our attempts at salvation by works are mani-
     festations of Cain’s action here. True worship must be based on a
     realization that only through God’s grace can we have any hope of
     eternal life.

      Examine your own thoughts, motives, and inner feelings about
      worship. How Christ-centered is your worship, or might you be
      focusing too much upon yourself?

     Two Lines of Worshipers
       In Genesis 4, we start getting a hint of the moral degradation that
     was coming after the Fall. Lamech became a polygamist and then
     got involved in some sort of violence that brought fear into his heart.
     In contrast, Genesis 4:25, 26 shows that some people were seeking
     to be faithful, for at that time “men began to call on the name of the
     Lord” (NKJV).

Read Genesis 6:1–8. What process do we see taking place here, and
     why is it so dangerous? What results did this lead to?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Little by little, the two classes of worshipers began to merge (Gen.
     6:1–4). Yet, in spite of the great wickedness in the earth, there were
     holy men of giant intellect who kept alive the knowledge of God.
     Though only a few of them are mentioned in Scripture, “all through
     the ages God had faithful witnesses, truehearted worshipers.”—Ellen
     G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 84. The wickedness of the
     human heart, however, became so great that the Lord had to wipe
     humanity out and start over.
       Hence, the Flood.

What was the first thing the Bible records Noah as doing after he
     came out of the ark, and why is that important? Gen. 8:20.

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       How fascinating that the first thing Noah does is worship. And
     central to that worship is the sacrifice. This is the first record of the
     patriarchs building a place of worship, an altar on which to offer their
     sacrifices. Thus, before doing anything else, Noah acknowledges his
     total dependence upon the Lord and upon the coming of the Messiah,
     who will give His life in order to redeem humanity. Noah knew that
     he was saved only through God’s grace; without it, he would have
     perished with the rest of the world.

      How do you daily show your acknowledgment of God’s grace
      in your life? Or more important, how should you show that
      acknowledgment?
                                                                            9

     The Faith of Abraham
Read Genesis 12:1–8. What do these verses reveal about Abram
     (later Abraham) and his calling by God?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Abraham, a descendant of Seth, was faithful to God, even though
     some of his relatives had begun conforming to the worship of idols,
     which was so prevalent in their culture. But God called him to sepa-
     rate from his kindred and his comfortable surroundings in order to
     become the father of a nation of worshipers who would uphold and
     represent the true God.
       No doubt he and Sarah influenced many to accept the worship
     of the true God. But there was another reason, too, why God called
     Abraham to father a new nation. “ ‘Because Abraham obeyed My
     voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My
     laws’ ” (Gen. 26:5, NKJV). And another as well: “And he believed in
     the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness” (Gen. 15:6).
       At the same time, however, Abraham had some crucial and painful
     lessons to learn.

Read Genesis 22:1–18. Why this terrible test for Abraham? What was
     the real message God wanted him to understand? Vss. 8, 13, 14.

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        As we have seen, the plan of salvation centers on the death of Jesus,
     God’s Son, and from the start this death was symbolized by the sacrifi-
     cial system of worship. While the Lord wanted people to use only ani-
     mals, in the pagan cultures folk actually sacrificed their own children,
     something that God said He hated (Deut. 12:31). Whatever powerful
     personal lessons about faith and trust Abraham learned through this
     trial, this act stands through the ages as an incredibly powerful symbol
     of the centrality of the death of Christ for salvation. Abraham, we could
     imagine, got a small taste of the pain that the death of Christ must have
     caused the Father, yet only through Christ’s death could humanity be
     saved.

      Dwell on the kind of faith that Abraham exhibited there. It is
      truly amazing; one hardly can imagine it. What should this
      teach us about the weakness of our own faith?

     Bethel, the House of God
        Jacob and Esau, like Cain and Abel, represent two classes of
     worshipers. Esau’s bold, adventuresome spirit appealed to his
     quiet, retiring father. Jacob, on the other hand, appeared to have
     a more spiritual nature. But he also had some serious character
     flaws. Jacob wanted the birthright, which legally belonged to his
     elder twin. And he was willing to become involved in his mother’s
     deceptive scheme to obtain it. As a result, Jacob fled in terror to
     escape his brother’s anger and hatred, never to see his beloved
     mother again.

Read the story of Jacob’s flight (Gen. 28:10–22). Note the messages
     of encouragement and assurance God gave him through a dream.
     What was Jacob’s response?

     Though for Jacob it was only a pillar of stone, Bethel became a sig-
     nificant place in sacred history. Here Jacob worshiped the God of his
     fathers. Here he made a vow of faithfulness to Him. And here, like
     Abraham, he promised to return to God a tithe—a tenth of his material
     blessings—as an act of worship.
       Notice Jacob’s sense of fear and awe because of the presence of
     God. He must have understood better than ever before the greatness
     of God in contrast to himself, and thus the Bible records his attitude
     of fear, reverence, and awe. The next thing he does is worship. Here,
     too, we see a principle regarding the kind of attitude we should have
     in worship, an attitude that is revealed in Revelation 14:7, in the call
     to “fear God.”
       Worship is not about approaching God as you would some buddy
     or pal. Our attitude should be that of a sinner in dire need of grace,
     falling before our Maker with a sense of need, fear, and gratefulness
     that God, the Creator of the universe, would love us and do so much
     in order to redeem us.

      How much awe, reverence, and fear do you have when you wor-
      ship the Lord? Or is your heart hard, cold, and ungrateful? If
      the latter, how can you change?

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Creation,” pp. 47–51;
         “The Temptation and Fall,” pp. 60–62; “Cain and Abel Tested,”
         pp. 71–74; “After the Flood,” pp. 105–107; “The Test of Faith,”
         pp. 148–153; “The Night of Wrestling,” pp. 197–203, in Patriarchs
         and Prophets.

            “[Jacob’s] vow [at Bethel] was the outflow of a heart filled with
         gratitude for the assurance of God’s love and mercy. Jacob felt that
         God had claims upon him which he must acknowledge, and that
         the special tokens of divine favor granted him demanded a return.
         So does every blessing bestowed upon us call for a response to the
1        Author of all our mercies. The Christian should often review his past
         life and recall with gratitude the precious deliverances that God has
         wrought for him. . . . He should recognize all of them as evidences
         of the watchcare of heavenly angels. In view of these innumerable
         blessings he should often ask, with subdued and grateful heart, ‘What
         shall I render unto the Lord for all His benefits toward me?’ Psalm
2        116:12.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 187.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Dwell more on the topic of how righteousness by faith in what
          Christ has done for us should be at the center of all our worship.
          As you do, dwell on these questions: (1) Why do we worship
          Him? (2) What has He done that makes Him worthy of worship?
          (3) What purpose does our worship of God serve?

          l
          2 How can our worship services become a more effective tool in
          witnessing to the world who God really is and what He is like?
          What elements in worship, which we have considered in this
          week’s lesson, can be especially helpful in witnessing?

          l3 Review the story of Abraham’s giving his tithe to Melchizedek
          (Gen. 14:20). In what ways is tithing an act of worship? What are
          we saying to God when we return to Him our tithe?

          l
          4 Dwell more on the idea of fear and reverence in worship. Why
          is this an important element? What’s wrong with an attitude in
          worship that seems to put God on our own level, in which we
          relate to Him in worship with the same attitude we have toward
          a good friend and nothing more?

   Gustave looked at the advertisement for evangelistic meetings. He was curi-
ous about these Seventh-day Adventists, who, he was told, sinned by working
in their gardens on Sunday in order to keep Saturday holy. Associating with
Adventists was forbidden in his village in Burundi, a tiny country in central
Africa. But Gustave loved religious meetings and decided to risk going.
   The first message he heard touched his heart, and he returned the fol-
lowing weekend. He wished he could attend on school nights too. After
the second weekend of meetings, Gustave asked the local elder where he
lived. Gustave wanted to come and ask more questions about what he
was learning. After studying the Bible with the elder for several weeks,
Gustave asked to join the Adventist Church. His parents weren’t happy,
but they didn’t forbid him to follow his faith.
   Schools in Burundi held classes on Sabbaths, but Gustave skipped
classes to attend church instead. One of his teachers warned him that if
he continued missing classes on Sabbath he could be expelled. When
Gustave’s parents learned that he was skipping school, they accused him
of becoming a rebel or being duped. “I’m not a rebel or a member of a
political group,” Gustave explained. “I just want to worship God.” He
invited his parents to follow his example or at least to allow him the free-
dom to worship as God was leading him.
   Gustave tried to explain his faith to the school principal, hoping to be
excused from classes. But the principal accused him of spreading a bad
message through the school. Reluctantly, Gustave attended classes on
Sabbath. But he tried to focus on Christ, not class work.
   The next year Gustave transferred to another high school that didn’t
hold classes on Sabbaths. But it held mandatory religious groups that
day. Gustave was the only Adventist student in the school, so he joined a
Protestant group and became a leader. He shared his faith with his fellow
students, and several wanted to know more. He studied the Bible with
those who were interested, but most of the students’ parents refused to let
their children associate with Adventists.
   When Gustave graduated from high school and began looking for work,
his parents tried to force him to take a job that required Sabbath work.
When Gustave refused, his parents refused to support him. At last he
found a temporary job with ADRA.
   Gustave advises young people to follow God’s leading, no matter what
troubles come their way. He thanks God for those who gave mission offer-
ings so that Adventists in Burundi could hold the evangelistic meetings
that led him to Jesus.

      Worship and the Exodus:
      Understanding Who God Is




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Exod. 3:1–15; 12:1–36;
  20:4, 5; 32:1–6; 33:12–23.
     			
Memory Text: “ ‘I am the Lord your God, who brought you out
  of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. You shall have
  no other gods before Me’ ” (Exodus 20:2, 3, NKJV).



      I
          n speaking to the woman at the well, Jesus said, “ ‘You worship
          what you do not know; we know what we worship, for salvation is
          of the Jews’ ” (John 4:22, NKJV). Imagine, worshiping what you do
      not know. In a sense, that is what almost all the world has done, or per-
      haps is doing now—worshiping what they do not know. When you see
      someone bowing down and worshiping a block of stone, thinking it will
      answer their prayers, you are seeing people worshiping what they do
      not know. That is, they are worshiping what they think can bring them
      salvation but cannot. In a more modern context, people who make gods
      out of power, money, fame, and self are, likewise, worshiping what
      they do not know. They are worshiping that which cannot save them.
        In the immediate Christian context, the question for us could be: do
      we know what we are worshiping? Do we know the Lord whom we
      praise and honor with our mouths? Who is He? What is His name?
      What is He like?
        This week we will look at early accounts of the children of Israel
      and how their encounters with the Lord reveal to us more about the
      nature and the character of the God we profess to serve and worship.
      After all, what sense does it make to worship what we do not know?

     Holy Ground
        It would be one thing for Moses, living in the wilderness, to see a
     bush burning. That itself might not be such a remarkable event; he
     probably had seen things like that before. What he most likely never
     saw before, however, was that the burning bush was not consumed:
     it kept burning and burning. At that moment Moses knew that he was
     seeing a “great sight,” something remarkable, even supernatural.

Read Exodus 3:1–15. What foundational elements of true worship
     can be seen in these verses?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Right from the start, we see here something of the holiness of God
     and the attitude in which we need to approach Him. It was God who
     told Moses to take off his shoes, for this was holy ground. The Lord
     was making clear the distinction between Himself—the Lord—and
     Moses, a sinner in need of grace. Reverence, awe, and fear—these
     are the attitudes that are crucial for us in order to engage in true wor-
     ship.
       Another important point is the God-centeredness of this experience.
     Moses’ first response to God was, “Who am I that I should go?” The
     focus was on himself—his needs, his weaknesses, and his fears. Soon
     after, however, he shifts from himself to God and what God would do.
     How crucial that all worship centers on the Lord, not on ourselves.
       That leads to another crucial element in worship: that of salvation
     and deliverance. The Exodus from Egypt has stood symbolically for
     the salvation we all have in Christ (1 Cor. 10:1–4). God was not
     appearing to Moses just to make Himself known; He was appearing
     to him in order to let him know of the great work of deliverance that
     He was going to do on behalf of the children of Israel. In the same
     way, Jesus did not come to this earth merely to represent God and help
     us know more about Him. No, Jesus came to die for our sins, to give
     His life as a ransom, to die on the cross the death that we deserve.
     Through His death, of course, we know more and more about the
     character of God, but in the end Christ came to pay the penalty for our
     sins and thus give us true deliverance, the deliverance symbolized in
     part by what the Lord did for Israel in freeing the nation from Egypt.

      How much time do you spend thinking about the Cross and
      the deliverance we have been given through Jesus? Or do you
      spend more time thinking about other things, things that cannot
      save you? What are the implications of your answer?
                                                                           15

     The Death of the Firstborn:
     Passover and Worship
       “That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the Lord’s passover, who
     passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he
     smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people
     bowed the head and worshipped” (Exod. 12:27).

       The Hebrew word translated “worshipped” in the above verse
     comes from a root that means “to bow down” or “to prostrate one-
     self.” The word itself almost always appears in a verb form that
     intensifies the meaning or that gives the idea of repetition. One
     almost could imagine a person bowing up and down, up and down,
     in reverence and awe and gratitude. Indeed, considering the context,
     that is not hard to see.

Read the story of that first Passover night, in Exodus 12:1–36. How
     is the gospel, which should be at the center of all our worship,
     revealed in these verses?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Unless covered by the blood, the children of Israel would face the
     loss of their firstborn. For them, the firstborn (usually meaning the
     oldest son) had special privileges and responsibilities, only to later
     be replaced by the Levites (Num. 3:12). Israel itself was deemed the
     Lord’s “firstborn” (Exod. 4:22), indicative of its special relationship
     to the Creator. In the New Testament, Jesus has been called the “first-
     born” (Rom. 8:29; Col. 1:15, 18).
        Though the firstborn were spared here, in reality Christ “the first-
     born” was to die, a death symbolized by the blood placed over the
     doors of the houses. This act stands as a powerful representation of
     the substitutionary death of Jesus. He died so that the “firstborn,” in
     a sense all God’s saved people (see Heb. 12:23), would be spared the
     death they deserve.

      In Egypt the people had obeyed their masters out of fear; now
      they would learn that true worship flows from a heart filled
      with love and gratitude to the One who alone has power to
      deliver and save. How can you learn to better appreciate and
      love the Lord? How does sin tend to dampen that love?

     No Other Gods
        Imagine the scene: Mount Sinai enveloped in a thick cloud, quaking
     with thunder, lightning flashing, trumpets blasting. The people trem-
     bled. Smoke filled the air because the God of Israel had descended in
     fire upon the holy mount (Exod. 19:16–19). There amid the cloud and
     the smoke, He revealed Himself in awful grandeur. Then the voice of
     their Deliverer proclaimed the first four commandments, all of which
     are directly linked to worship.

Focus on Exodus 20:1–6. What important points about worship can
     we take from those verses?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       The Ten Commandments begin with God’s reminder to the children
     of Israel of their deliverance. Only the Lord, the true God, the only
     God, could have done that for them. All other gods, such as the gods
     of Egypt, were false gods, human creations unable to save or deliver
     anyone. These “gods” also demonstrated selfish, demanding, and
     often immoral character traits that reflected their human origin. What
     a contrast to the Lord, the loving and self-sacrificing Creator and
     Redeemer. Thus, after centuries of being immersed in the crude poly-
     theism of a pagan culture, the children of Israel needed to know their
     Lord and God as the only God, especially now as they were entering
     into the covenant relationship with Him.

How does that background help us better understand what the Lord
     said to them in Exodus 20:4, 5? Also, how can we take the prin-
     ciple seen there and apply it to ourselves today?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

      Ellen G. White wrote, “Whatever we cherish that tends to
      lessen our love for God or to interfere with the service due
      Him, of that do we make a god.”—Patriarchs and Prophets,
      p. 305. Ask yourself: What, if any, are the gods in my life that
      are competing for affections, my time, my priorities, or my
      goals? What are they, and how can I remove them?

                                                                       17

     “These Be Your Gods . . .”
Read Exodus 32:1–6 and answer the following questions:

     1. What event, what catalyst, first opened the way to this powerful
     expression of false worship? What lessons should we as Seventh-
     day Adventists take from it?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     2. What was this false God made of, and what does that say about
     how fruitless this kind of worship is?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     3. How did their worship of this statue contrast to their worship
     of the Lord?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        They “rose up to play”; they “have corrupted themselves”; they
     “have turned aside quickly” (Exod. 32:6–8). Hardly seems to reflect
     the awe and reverence that is to mark true worship, does it?
        The mixed multitude (Egyptians who had chosen to accompany
     Israel in the Exodus or who were married to Hebrews) no doubt influ-
     enced the people and demanded of Aaron the form and style of worship
     familiar to them. When Joshua heard the noise from below, he came to
     Moses suggesting that there was war in the camp. But Moses, having
     lived in the royal court of Egypt, knew all too well what those noises
     were. He probably recognized the sounds of licentious revelry—the
     dancing, the loud music, the singing, shouting, and general confusion
     that marked their idolatrous worship (Exod. 32:17–22).
        When they worshiped the true God, they did so in humility and
     reverence. Now, worshiping before this calf of gold, they behaved
     like animals. They had “changed their glory into the image of an ox”
     (Ps. 106:20, NKJV). It does seem to be a principle of human nature that
     we rise no higher than that which we worship or revere.

      Notice how quickly and easily they compromised truth in their
      worship. Notice how quickly the local culture came in and
      turned them away from the true God. How can we make sure
      we, in our own worship, do not fall into the same trap?

     “Show Me Your Glory”
       In the golden calf experience, the people of Israel had broken their
     covenant with God; they had taken His name in vain by their sinful
     and false worship. Moses pled with God on their behalf (Exod. 32:30–
     33). Because of their terrible sin, God commanded His “stiffnecked”
     people to remove their ornaments so that He might “know what to
     do” to them (Exod. 33:4, 5). To those who, in humility, repented, the
     removal of their ornaments was a symbol of their reconciliation with
     God (Exod. 33:4–6).

Read Exodus 33:12–23. Why did Moses ask what he did of the Lord?
     What did Moses want to learn? Why did he believe that he needed
     these things?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Moses’ desire to see God’s glory was not one of curiosity or pre-
     sumption but came from a deep heart hunger to sense God’s presence
     after such blatant apostasy. Though Moses had not partaken of their
     sin, he was impacted by it. We do not live in isolation from other
     members of our church. What impacts one impacts others, a point we
     should never forget.
        Look carefully at Exodus 33:13. Moses says to God that he, Moses,
     wanted to “know Him.” Despite all that the Lord had done, Moses still
     sensed his own need, his own weakness, his own helplessness, and
     thus he wanted a closer walk with the Lord. He wanted to know bet-
     ter the God upon whom He was so dependent. How interesting that,
     centuries later, Jesus said, “ ‘And this is life eternal, that they might
     know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent’ ”
     (John 17:3). He wanted to see the glory of God, something that would
     make him realize even more his own sinfulness and helplessness and,
     hence, his utter dependence upon the Lord. After all, look at what
     Moses had been called to do; look at the challenges he had to face.
     No wonder he felt this need to know God.
        Here, too, we come to a crucial point about worship. Worship
     should be about God; it should be about us in humility and faith and
     submission, seeking to know more about Him and His “way” (Exod.
     33:13).

      How well do you know the Lord? More important, what choices
      can you make that will enable you to know Him better than you
      do? How can you learn to worship in a way that will give you a
      better appreciation of God and His glory?
                                                                          19

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Law Given to Israel,”
         pp. 303–314; “Idolatry at Sinai,” pp. 315–330; “Satan’s Enmity
         Against the Law,” pp. 331–342, in Patriarchs and Prophets;
         Pss. 105:26–45; 106:8–23.

            “Humility and reverence should characterize the deportment of all
         who come into the presence of God. In the name of Jesus we may
         come before Him with confidence, but we must not approach Him
         with the boldness of presumption, as though He were on a level with
         ourselves. There are those who address the great and all-powerful and
1
         holy God, . . . as they would address an equal, or even an inferior.
         There are those who conduct themselves in His house as they would
         not presume to do in the audience chamber of an earthly ruler. These
         should remember that they are in His sight whom seraphim adore,
         before whom angels veil their faces. God is greatly to be reverenced;
         all who truly realize His presence will bow in humility before Him”
2
         —Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 252.
            “True reverence for God is inspired by a sense of His infinite great-
         ness and a realization of His presence. With this sense of the Unseen,
         every heart should be deeply impressed. The hour and place of prayer
         are sacred because God is there. . . . Angels, when they speak that
         name, veil their faces. With what reverence, then, should we, who are
         fallen and sinful, take it upon our lips!”—Ellen G. White, Prophets
         and Kings, pp. 48, 49.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Discuss these aspects of God’s character: His nearness to us—
          and His greatness, majesty, and holiness. Theologians refer to
          these two concepts as His Immanence and Transcendence. Think
          of ways that these two important truths about God both can be
          emphasized and balanced in our worship services.

          l2 What lessons can we learn from the tragic story of Israel’s
          worship of the golden calf and the serious consequences of
          worshiping false gods (visible or invisible)? What are some of
          the idols that are commonly worshiped in your society? What
          lessons do you see in this story for the church today, for us who
          have been waiting a long time for the Lord to come?

          l
          3 What about our worship services? How can they better help
          us sense the majesty, the glory, and the power of God? Or do
          they tend to bring God down to our own level?

          l
          4 What does it mean to know the Lord? If someone were to ask
          you, “How do you know the Lord?” how would you respond? In
          other words, how can a human being come to know God person-
          ally?

  I’m a Seventh-day Adventist teenager in Poland, and attending summer
camp and camp meeting at Camp Zatonie is an important part of my life.
For many teenagers, camp is more about meeting friends we haven’t seen
for months than it is about the spiritual opportunities available there.
  Two years ago, I went to camp looking forward to seeing my friends.
But it was raining when we arrived. So, I decided to attend the meetings
and save my visiting for when the sun came out. But the rain continued the
entire two weeks of camp. So, each day I had to choose whether to spend
my time in the rain with my friends, stay in my tent, or attend the meetings
in the big tent. I didn’t want to get soaked while visiting with friends, and
there wasn’t much to do inside my tent, so I went to hear the sermons.
  I’ve grown up hearing good sermons, but I’d never been passionate
about what I believe. So, I was surprised when I found the camp’s speak-
ers so compelling. I wasn’t bored or tired. In fact, I found myself wanting
to attend more and more meetings.
  The youth speaker was a Polish pastor from Australia who helped me to
see God in a different way. And I especially enjoyed the prayer meetings
we held on the beach by the lake. We hardly noticed the rain as we talked
to God together.
  I did spend some time with my friends at camp. After all, it’s the only
time many of us get to see each other. But my attention was focused on
God rather than on catching up with friends.
  I joined a class with those who planned to be baptized at the end of the
camp. When I told my friends, they were excited for me. Two of them
even decided to be baptized with me. What a wonderful day that was!
  For many believers in Poland, Camp Zatonie is at the heart of our faith.
                            Recently the camp received part of a Thirteenth
                            Sabbath Offering to help upgrade the camp’s
                            buildings and programs so that more people
                            can come to learn about God. Thank you for
                            helping make this important ministry even bet-
                            ter. I’m already planning to go to camp meeting
                            next year. I wouldn’t miss it!

      The Sabbath and Worship




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Exod. 20:11, Deut. 5:15,
      Isa. 44:15–20, Rom. 6:16–23, Matt. 11:28–30.

Memory Text: “O come, let us worship and bow down: let us
      kneel before the Lord our maker. For he is our God; and we are the
      people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand” (Psalm 95:6, 7).



      A
              s we saw in the introduction, Creation and Redemption are cen-
              tral to the first angel’s message and the theme of worship. The
              first angel calls us to the “everlasting gospel,” the good news of
      salvation in Jesus, a salvation that includes not only forgiveness of sin
      but power over it. The gospel, then, promises us a new life in Christ, the
      promise of sanctification, which itself is part of the process of salvation
      and Redemption (John 17:17, Acts 20:32, 1 Thess. 5:23).
        And, as we saw, the first angel’s message includes a special
      reminder that the One whom we are to worship is our Creator, the One
      who made us and the world we live in.
        Thus, linked to worship are the themes of Creation, Redemption,
      and sanctification. Not surprisingly, these three themes are revealed
      in the Sabbath, a crucial element in the events depicted in Revelation
      14, when the question faces all of us: do we worship the Creator, the
      Redeemer, and the Sanctifier or the beast and his image? The texts do
      not leave us any third option.
        This week we will take a look at the Sabbath commandment and
      how these themes are revealed in this day. As we study, ask yourself,
      how can we make these themes central to our worship experience?

     Creation and Redemption: The
     Foundation of Worship
       “Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy” (Exod. 20:8). The
     words remember and memorial in Hebrew come from the same Hebrew
     root, zkr. When God said “Remember,” He was giving the people a
     memorial of two great events, one the foundation of the other.

According to the fourth commandment, what are these two events,
     and how are they related to each other? Exod. 20:11, Deut. 5:15.

        Christ’s role as Creator is inextricably linked to His role as
     Redeemer, and every week the Sabbath highlights both of these roles.
     Not monthly, not yearly, but weekly, and without exception—that is
     how important it is. The One who designed and made us is the same
     One who delivered Israel from Egypt and who delivers us from the
     bondage of sin.

Read Colossians 1:13–22. How does Paul clearly link Christ in His
     role as Creator and Redeemer?

     _______________________________________________________

       Creation and Redemption are at the foundation of all biblical truth,
     and they are so important that we have been ordered to keep the
     Sabbath as a reminder of these truths. From Eden, where the seventh
     day was first set aside, up until now, there have been people who have
     worshiped the Lord through keeping the seventh-day Sabbath holy.

      Think for a moment how important these two truths must be for
      the Lord to have given us a weekly reminder of them; so impor-
      tant that He commands us to devote one-seventh of our lives in a
      special kind of rest in order that we can better focus our attention
      on these truths. How can your Sabbath-worship experience help
      enhance your appreciation of Christ as Creator and Redeemer?

     Remember Your Creator
        The Bible begins with the famous line, “In the beginning God created
     the heavens and the earth.” The verb “created,” bara, refers to actions
     of God only. Humans can build things, make things, create things, and
     form things, but God alone can bara. Only God can create space, time,
     matter, and energy—all part of the material world that we exist in. It is
     all here, only because God bara-ed it.
        Of course, how He did it remains a mystery. Science barely under-
     stands what matter itself is, much less how it was created and why it
     exists in the form that it does. What is crucial, however, is that we
     never forget for a moment where it all came from. “By the word of
     the Lord the heavens were made. . . . For He spoke, and it was done;
     He commanded, and it stood fast” (Ps. 33:6, 9, NKJV).
        Also, when an important project is finished, people like to cele-
     brate. For example, when we build a church, we dedicate it to God.
     Similarly, when God finished with the earth, He commemorated the
     event by setting aside a special day, the Sabbath.

Compare Isaiah 40:25, 26; 45:12, 18; Colossians 1:16, 17; Hebrews
     1:2 to Isaiah 44:15–20; 46:5–7. What contrast is being made here?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Ever since the great controversy between Christ and Satan reached
     the earth, the enemy has tried to lead people to doubt or deny the exis-
     tence of the true God, the Creator. Through ignorance of His Word or
     denial of the evidence of His creative power, human intelligence seeks
     to find ways to explain our origins in ways other than from the Lord.
     All sorts of theories have been proposed. The most popular today, of
     course, is evolution, which posits random mutation and natural selec-
     tion as the means by which all life and intelligence exist. Someone
     recently presented a theory that we are all just computer projections
     and that we do not really exist but are merely the computer creations
     of some super-race of alien beings. In many ways, one could argue
     that the wooden gods Isaiah wrote about, which were worshiped by
     their own makers, are as good as many of the other theories of origins
     often presented as an alternative to the God of the Bible.

      If we truly accept the Sabbath for what the Bible says it is—a
      memorial of God’s six days of Creation—how can we be pro-
      tected from false ideas about our origins? Also, who would want
      to worship a God who used the vicious and violent process of
      evolution to create us, as some teach?

     Freedom From Slavery
        		
        As we have already seen, the Sabbath points not only to Creation,
     an important theme of worship, but also to Redemption. Deuteronomy
     5:15 tells us, “Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the
     Lord your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an
     outstretched arm. Therefore the Lord your God has commanded you to
     observe the Sabbath day” (NIV). These words echo to the crucial theme
     of the first angel’s message, that of Redemption and salvation.
        And this redemption is symbolized by what the Lord did for the
     children of Israel through the Exodus. No god in Egypt had the power
     to stop this nation of slaves from escaping their bondage. Only the
     God of Israel, who revealed Himself in powerful miracles and His
     presence in majestic and blinding glory, had the ability to deliver
     them with “a mighty hand” and a “stretched out arm” (Deut. 5:15).
     God wanted them to remember “that the Lord Himself is God; there
     is none other besides Him” (Deut 4:35, NKJV). So, He gave them the
     Sabbath day to be a constant reminder of His great deliverance and as
     a reminder to us of the bondage from which Christ has freed us.

Read Romans 6:16–23. What promises are offered us there, and how
     does this relate to what the Lord did for Israel in Egypt?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        The New Testament clearly teaches that the slavery of sin
     demands a powerful Savior, as did the Egyptian bondage of ancient
     Israel. That is what the children of Israel had in their Lord; and that
     is what we as Christians today have, as well, because the God who
     delivered them from their bondage is the same One who delivers us
     from ours.			
        If we ever needed a reason to worship the Lord, would it not be for
     the deliverance from slavery that He has won for us? The children of
     Israel sang a great song once they had been delivered. (See Exodus 15.)
     Thus, for us the Sabbath worship experience should be a celebration of
     God’s grace in freeing us not only from the legal penalty of sin (which
     fell upon Jesus on our behalf) but from the power of sin to enslave us.

      What does it mean to no longer be slaves to sin? Does it mean
      we are not sinful, or that we do not at times still sin? Most
      important, how can you learn to claim and make real the prom-
      ises of freedom that the gospel offers us?
                                                                        25

     Remember Your Sanctifier
Read Exodus 31:13. What do you understand this to mean? How is
     it relevant for us today? What does it mean to have God sanctify
     us? How can we experience this process in our own lives?		

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Creation, Redemption, sanctification—they all are related. Creation,
     of course, is the foundation of everything (for without it there would
     be no one to redeem and sanctify). Yet, in our fallen condition, cre-
     ation is no longer enough; we needed Redemption, the promise of
     forgiveness for our sins. Otherwise, we would face eternal destruc-
     tion, and our creation would be forever over.
        Of course, inseparably linked to Redemption is sanctification, the
     process by which we grow in holiness and in grace in our lives. The
     word translated as “sanctify” in Exodus 31:13 comes from the same
     root word used in Exodus 20:8, when the Lord tells the people to keep
     the Sabbath “holy.” The same root appears in Exodus 20:11, which
     says that God “hallowed” or “made holy” the Sabbath day (see also
     Genesis 2:3, where God “sanctified” the seventh day). In all these
     cases the root, qds, means “to be holy,” “to set aside as holy,” to be
     “dedicated as holy.”
        God called Israel and set them apart as His holy people, to be a light
     to the world. Christ called His disciples to a mission of carrying the
     gospel to the world. Central to that task is the holiness and character
     of the ones spreading the message. The gospel is not just about no
     longer being condemned for our sins. As we saw yesterday, it is about
     being free from the bondage of our sins. It is about being new people
     in Christ and having our lives be living witnesses to what God can do
     for us here and now.

      Read 2 Corinthians 5:17. What is Paul saying here, and how can
      we relate this text to the themes of Creation and Redemption
      and the Sabbath? How can our Sabbath worship help us focus
      on these themes?

     Resting in Redemption
       Creation, Redemption, and sanctification: we have all these in
     Christ, and they all are symbolized in a special way through the bless-
     ings of the Sabbath.

In Matthew 11:28–30 read Jesus’ invitation to rest. How does the
     Sabbath fit in with what Jesus is telling us here?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       The “rest” Jesus offered to people included emotional, psychologi-
     cal, and spiritual rest for those who were burdened with heavy loads,
     including the load of sin, guilt, and fear. In addition to the basic
     human need for physical rest, there is an equally important need for
     the mind and the spirit to have a change of pace—to rest from the
     burdens and the stress of daily living. God designed the Sabbath
     for precisely that. Studies have shown that productivity in the work
     place actually increases with a weekly break. Bringing closure to the
     usual routine of life enhances mental acuity and physical endurance.
     Further, the Sabbath provides the needed sense of anticipation that
     helps prevent boredom and fatigue.
       While anyone can say that they are resting in Christ, the Sabbath
     gives us a concrete and physical manifestation of that rest. The
     Sabbath stands as a symbol of the rest that we truly have in Him, in
     the salvation Christ has wrought for us.
       The Sabbath also meets us at the level of our emotional life. It gives
     us a sense of identity: we are created in the image of God, and we
     belong to Him because He made us.
       And just as God gave the marriage institution in Eden to meet the
     human need for horizontal intimacy, so He gave the Sabbath for verti-
     cal intimacy between the Creator and His creatures.
       The Sabbath promises fulfillment—what we may become through
     Christ’s work of restoration. It gives us hope for the future—the
     ultimate eternal Sabbath rest. But most important of all, the Sabbath
     meets us at the highest of all human needs, the need to worship
     something or Someone. God in His great wisdom has given us the
     Sabbath as a day set aside for worship, a day to spend in honor and
     praise of Him.

       What burdens are you carrying that you need to have rest
      from, and how can you learn to give them to Him? How can
      your Sabbath worship experience help you truly learn to rest
      in Him?
                                                                         27

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Creation,” pp. 44–51;
         “The Literal Week,” pp. 111–116, in Patriarchs and Prophets; “The
         Sabbath,” pp. 281–289, in The Desire of Ages.

            “God designed that [Sabbath] observance should designate [Israel]
         as His worshipers. It was to be a token of their separation from idola-
         try, and their connection with the true God. But in order to keep the
         Sabbath holy, men must themselves be holy. Through faith they must
         become partakers of the righteousness of Christ. . . . Only thus could
         the Sabbath distinguish Israel as the worshipers of God.”—Ellen G.
1        White, The Desire of Ages, p. 283.		
            “When the Lord delivered His people Israel from Egypt and com-
         mitted to them His law, He taught them that by the observance of the
         Sabbath they were to be distinguished from idolaters. It was this that
         made the distinction between those who acknowledge the sovereignty
         of God and those who refuse to accept Him as their Creator and
2        King.”—Ellen G. White, Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 349.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Dwell more on the idea of how true Sabbath keeping can
          protect us from many of the delusions regarding Creation.
          Think, for instance, about the final events regarding those who
          worship the beast as opposed to those who worship the Creator
          (see Revelation 14). How would a false understanding of our
3         origins—such as the idea that Jesus used evolution to create us—
          set people up to be deceived in the final days?

          l
          2 Go back over the question of Sabbath and worship. How does
          your church worship on Sabbath? Is the service geared toward
          exalting God as Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier? If not, what
          is the emphasis? How can we learn to keep the Lord as the focus
          of our worship experience?

          l3 Creation is central to all our beliefs. Why does nothing we
          believe as Seventh-day Adventists make any sense at all apart
          from God as the Creator? Creation is foundational to all that we
          believe, and the Sabbath is imbedded in the original Creation
          account. How do these facts help reveal just how pivotal and
          basic the Sabbath is? How does this help us better understand,
          too, how in the last days, when false powers seek to compel the
          worship that God alone deserves, the Sabbath will be so central
          to that final drama?

I Prayed You Would Come
by Artur Arakelyan
  I am a Global Mission pioneer. I was selling books door-to-door in
a city in Armenia. I knocked on one door in an apartment house, and a
woman answered. I introduced myself and my work. She welcomed me
in and listened as I told her about the books.
  She looked up with tears in her eyes and said, “Just before you came to
my door, I was praying that God would send someone to help me know
more about God and the Bible. I believe God sent you.” The woman,
Alvart, said that her 11-year-old daughter had been attending a Protestant
church and often told her things she was learning about God. Although
Alvart wasn’t attending the church, her daughter’s comments created a
hunger to know more.
  Then she told how one day three months earlier she had put her two-
year-old son to sleep in his stroller near the bedroom window and went
about her housework. Her daughter, Anna, was playing outside in the
apartment courtyard. The baby awoke and climbed from the stroller onto
the windowsill and fell out the window from their ninth-floor apartment.
A passerby saw the child falling and screamed. Anna looked up to see her
baby brother falling toward her. “Dear Jesus, help me!” she prayed, and
instinctively she held out her arms. The baby fell into her arms, and both
children tumbled to the ground. Amazingly, neither child was hurt.
  As Alvart recalled the story, tears welled in her eyes. “At first I thought
that God was punishing me for my sins,” she said. “But when I realized
that God had used my daughter’s church to save her brother, then I real-
ized that God was trying to help me. That’s when I began praying to know
more about God.”
  She couldn’t afford to buy the books she wanted, so I gave her a small
book and offered to study the Bible with her. She gladly accepted. She
didn’t have a Bible, so I gave her one. She is ready for baptism.
  When I first went to this town, we had not even one Seventh-day
Adventist there. Now we have a group of 10 people who are meeting in
a home every Sabbath and studying the Bible. Another 20 or so are inter-
ested to know more but haven’t committed themselves to Bible studies
yet. They’re from all walks of life—lawyers, doctors, taxi drivers, and
homemakers. I had met them by working as a literature evangelist.
  I praise God that our Sabbath School mission offerings help support the
work of Global Mission, one way to tell the world that Jesus loves them.

      Rejoicing Before the Lord: The
      Sanctuary and Worship




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Exod. 25:1–9; Exodus 35;
      29:38, 39; 25:10–22; Deut. 12:5–7, 12, 18; 16:13–16.

Memory Text: “And ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God,
      ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants,
      and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your
      gates; forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you”
      (Deuteronomy 12:12).



      R
             ussian writer Leo Tolstoy wrote about a friend who, nearing
             death, explained his own loss of faith. The man said that from
             his childhood he had prayed, his own act of private devotion
      and worship before going to sleep. One day, after a hunting trip with
      his brother, they were getting ready for bed in the same room, and
      he knelt down to pray. His brother looked at him and said, “You still
      doing that?” From that moment on, the man never prayed again, never
      worshiped again, never exercised any faith. The words “You still
      doing that?” revealed just how empty and meaningless this ritual had
      been to him all these years, and thus he stopped.
        This story illustrates the danger of mere ritual. Worship needs to
      come from the heart, from the soul, from a true relationship with God.
      That is why this week we will look at the ancient Israelite sanctuary
      service, the center of Israelite worship, and derive what lessons we
      can from it about how we can have a deeper worship experience.

     “That I May Dwell Among Them”
        “ ‘You will bring them in and plant them in the mountain of Your
     inheritance, in the place, O Lord, which You have made for Your own
     dwelling, the sanctuary, O Lord, which Your hands have established’ ”
     (Exod. 15:17, NKJV).
        This is the first mention in Scripture of a sanctuary. It was sung as
     part of the song of deliverance by the children of Israel after their escape
     from Egypt. The verse talks not just about the sanctuary but implies that
     it will be God’s dwelling on earth. The Hebrew word translated “dwell-
     ing” comes from a root that means, literally, “to sit.” Was the Lord
     really going to dwell, “to sit,” among His people here on earth?

Read Exodus 25:1–9. What are the two main points that we learn
     from the verses, and why are they amazing? (As you think about
     the answer, think about who God is, His power, His might and
     majesty.)

       The God who delivered Israel was now going to dwell among them.
     The same God who was able to perform so many incredible “signs
     and wonders” (Deut. 6:22), the God who created the heavens and the
     earth, would now live among His people. Talk about the presence of
     God being near!
       On top of that, He was going to live in a building that fallen human
     beings had made. He, who spoke the world into existence, could have
     spoken the word and created a magnificent structure. Instead, He had
     His people intimately and intricately involved in the creation of the
     place not only for His dwelling but the place that would be the center
     of all Israelite worship.
       The Israelites didn’t make the sanctuary according to human stan-
     dards but “ ‘according to . . . the pattern, . . . just so you shall make it’ ”
     (Exod. 25:9, NKJV). Every aspect of the earthly tabernacle was to
     represent a holy God properly and be worthy of His presence.
       Everything about it was to inspire a sense of awe and reverence.
     After all, this was the dwelling place of the Creator of the universe.

      Imagine standing outside a building and knowing that inside
      that very structure, Yahweh, the Creator God, the Lord of the
      heavens and earth, was dwelling. What kind of attitude would
      you have, and why? What should your answer tell you about
      the attitude you should have during worship?

      Willing Hearts
        As we saw yesterday, not only did the Lord choose to dwell among
      His people, He did so in a building that they were to make themselves,
      as opposed to something He created supernaturally. That is, He got
      them directly involved, an act that ideally would have drawn them
      closer to Him. Along with that, He didn’t miraculously create the
      material that would be used for the structure.

Read Exodus 35. What is happening here, and what important les-
      sons can we take from this for ourselves in regard to the whole
      question of worship?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         Notice the emphasis on the word willing. God said, “whoever is of
      a willing heart” (Exod. 35:5, NKJV), and everyone “whose heart was
      stirred” (Exod. 35:21, NKJV) responded. This means that there was
      no fire and thunder and loud voice from Sinai commanding them to
      give these offerings. Instead, here we see the working of the Holy
      Spirit, who never forces Himself on anyone. Their willingness to give
      revealed a sense of thanksgiving and gratefulness. After all, look what
      the Lord had done for them.
         Also, notice that the people were not only willing to give to the
      work of building a sanctuary, but they did so with a spirit of joy and
      energy. They willingly gave material gifts, their time, their talents,
      and the work of their creative abilities: “All the women whose hearts
      stirred with wisdom . . .” (vs. 26, NKJV); “everyone whose heart was
      stirred, to come and do the work” (Exod. 36:2, NKJV).

By giving as they were, what were the Israelites also doing, even before
      the sanctuary was made?

        We often tend to think of worship as a group of people coming
      together to sing, pray, and listen to a sermon. And while that is true,
      worship is not limited to that. What the children of Israel were doing
      here was worshiping. Every act of self-denial in giving up their own
      material goods, or their own time, or their own talents for the cause
      of their Lord was an act of worship.

       Think about your own acts of giving—tithes, offerings, time,
       talent. How have you experienced what it means to worship
       through these acts? By giving of yourself, how are you enriched
       in return?

      The Continual Burnt Offering
         “ ‘Now this is what you shall offer on the altar: two lambs of the
      first year, day by day continually. One lamb . . . in the morning,
      and the other lamb . . . at twilight’ ” (Exod. 29:38, 39, NKJV).

        The daily offering of lambs, the “continual burnt offering” (vs. 42),
      was to teach the people their constant need of God and their depen-
      dence on Him for forgiveness and acceptance. The fire on the altar
      was to be kept burning day and night (Lev. 6:8–13). This fire could
      serve as a perpetual reminder of their need of a Savior.
        God never intended the daily offering of a lamb to be simply a ritual
      or routine act. It was to be a time of “intense interest to the worship-
      ers,” a time of preparation for worship, in silent prayer and “with ear-
      nest heart searching and confession of sin.” Their faith was to grasp
      the promises of a Savior to come, the true Lamb of God who would
      spill His blood for the sins of the whole world (see Ellen G. White,
      Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 353).

How do the following texts link the death of Christ to animal sacri-
      fices in the Old Testament system? Heb. 10:1–4; 1 Pet. 1:18, 19.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         In Hebrews 10:5–10, Paul quotes Psalm 40:6–8, showing that Christ
      fulfilled the true meaning of the sacrificial offerings. He suggests that
      God had no pleasure in these sacrifices but that they were intended to
      be a time of sorrow for sin, of repentance, and of turning away from
      sin. Likewise, the giving of His Son as the ultimate sacrifice would be
      a time of terrible agony and heartrending sorrow for both the Father
      and the Son. Paul also emphasized that true worship must always flow
      from a forgiven, cleansed, and sanctified heart that delights in obeying
      the One who has made it all possible. “Therefore, I urge you breth-
      ren, . . . to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to
      God, which is your spiritual service of worship” (Rom. 12:1, NASB).
         Worship means, first and foremost, giving ourselves wholly and
      completely to God as a living sacrifice. When we give ourselves first,
      then our gifts, our praise, and our hearts will follow. This attitude is a
      sure protection against meaningless and empty rituals.

       Ask yourself these questions: Have I given everything over to
       Christ, who died for my sins? Or is there some corner of my
       heart or life that I refuse to let go of? If so, what is it, and how
       can I be willing to give it up?
                                                                              33

     Communion With God
        One of the key aspects of being a Christian, of having a saving rela-
     tionship with Christ, is that of knowing the Lord. Jesus Himself said,
     “ ‘And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true
     God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent’ ” (John 17:3). As in any
     kind of relationship, communication is the key.

Read Exodus 25:10–22. What are the people being told to make, and
     what promises are they given?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Above the sacred ark, which contained God’s holy law, and enshrined
     on the mercy seat dwelt the very presence of God in the Shekinah
     glory. There, “mercy and truth [were] met together; righteousness and
     peace . . . kissed each other” (Ps. 85:10). There, from the altar of
     incense in the Holy Place, the smoke ascended, representing the prayers
     of God’s people mingled with the merits and intercession of Christ.
       Amid all this is the promise: “And there I will meet with thee, and I
     will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the
     two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things
     which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel”
     (Exod. 25:22).
       God promised the people not just His presence; He promised to
     communicate with His people, to talk to them, to guide them in the
     ways that they should go.

What do these texts promise us? Pss. 37:23, 48:14, Prov. 3:6, John
     16:13.

        Today, of course, we do not have an earthly sanctuary, but we do
     have the promises of God’s guidance and presence in our lives if we
     surrender to Him. What believer has not seen the leading of the Lord
     at some point in his or her life?
        Here, too, is where worship comes in. We must worship the Lord
     in an attitude of submission, of surrender, of willingness to be led. A
     heart yielded to the Lord in prayer, submission, reverence, and surren-
     der, a heart sensing its own need of salvation, of grace, of repentance,
     is a heart that—full of worshipful praise to God—will be guided in
     the way that the Lord would desire. In the end, true worship should
     help you be more open to God’s leading because it should help you
     learn an attitude of faith and submission. There is nothing empty in
     this kind of worship.

      Rejoicing Before the Lord
         A substantial part of the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers
      centers on the sanctuary service—its construction, its services, the
      sacrifices and offerings presented there, and the ministration of the
      priests. It was a very sacred and holy place. After all, it was not only
      the place where God Himself dwelt, it was the place where Israel
      came to be forgiven and cleansed of sin. It was the place where Israel
      learned and experienced the gospel.
         At the same time, we must not come away with the idea that
      Israelite worship was cold, sterile, and formal. The Lord had set very
      strict guidelines on what was to be done, but these guidelines were
      not ends in themselves. Rather, they were means to an end, and the
      end was that His people would be a holy, joyful, and faithful covenant
      nation that would teach the world about the true God (Exod. 19:6,
      Deut. 4:5–7, Zech. 8:23).

What do these texts tell us about Israelite worship at the sanctuary?
      Lev. 23:39–44; Deut. 12:5–7, 12, 18; 16:13–16.

      _______________________________________________________

         One of the great struggles facing the church in our time today has
      to do with worship and worship styles. On one end, church services
      can be cold, formal, stale, and definitely without joy. The other danger
      is that emotions become the dominant factor: all people want to do is
      have a good time, “rejoicing” in the Lord at the expense of any kind
      of strict adherence to biblical truths.
         An important point to remember, a lesson that we can learn from
      the sanctuary model, is that all true worship, which should lead to
      rejoicing, must do so in the context of biblical truth. God gave the
      Israelites very clear, strict, and formal instructions regarding the con-
      struction of the sanctuary and its ministry and services, all of which
      were meant to teach them the truths of salvation, Redemption, media-
      tion, and judgment. And yet, at the same time, they were to rejoice
      before the Lord in their worship. This theme appears again and again.
      It should be clear, then, that one can be very strong in biblical teach-
      ing and at the same time have a joyous worship experience. After all,
      if the truths of salvation, Redemption, mediation, and judgment are
      not worth rejoicing over, what is?

       What is your own experience in rejoicing before the Lord?
       What does this mean to you? How can you have a more joyful
       worship experience? How can you make sure your worship
       experience is not similar to the man in this week’s introduction
       that Tolstoy told about?
                                                                            35

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Tabernacle and Its
         Services,” pp. 343–358; “The Sin of Nadab and Abihu,” pp. 359–362;
         “The Law and the Covenants,” pp. 367–373, in Patriarchs and
         Prophets; “The Lord’s Vineyard,” pp. 288–290, in Christ’s Object
         Lessons; “Ellen G. White Comments,” in The SDA Bible Commentary,
         vol. 4, pp. 1139, 1140.

           From the Holy Shekinah, “God made known His will. Divine mes-
         sages were sometimes communicated to the high priest by a voice
         from the cloud. Sometimes a light fell upon the angel at the right, to
         signify approval or acceptance, or a shadow or cloud rested upon the
1        one at the left to reveal disapproval or rejection.”—Ellen G. White,
         Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 349.
           “In them [His people] the Lord designed to dwell in His fulness
         in this world; not only in a general way by dwelling in a tent; but by
         so completely taking possession of their lives, as to show them, and
         through them the world, how the Messiah would be the dwelling-place
2        of God.”—F. C. Gilbert, Practical Lessons From the Experience of
         Israel for the Church of Today (Concord, Mass.: Good Tidings Press,
         1902), p. 351.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 How can you help others see that the giving of tithes and
          offerings is truly an act of worship? What are we compromising
3         when we do not tithe and do not give offerings?

          l
          2 Look at your own church services. Do they lean more toward
          the cold, formal, sterile, and joyless? Or do they lean more
          toward the emotional, toward excitement, and feeling? Or is
          there a good balance between the extremes? Discuss.

          l3 In an attempt to reach out to the nonchurched, some congre-
          gations radically have altered their worship services. While this
          could be a very good thing, what dangers should they be aware
          of, such as that of compromise and of watering down crucial
          biblical truths?

          l
          4 In some worship services, rituals have been performed a
          certain way for many years, and that is the reason given for not
          wanting to make any changes. How would you respond to the
          answer, “This is how we have always done it” when change is
          suggested and rejected?

          l
          5 The earthly sanctuary was a very sacred and holy place, the
          place where God Himself dwelt. At the same time, the children
          of Israel were to rejoice before the Lord there. What lessons can
    36    we draw from these important truths about worship?

Reluctant Witness
   Galina and Nadia have been friends since their childhood in a small city
in Bulgaria. Galina sometimes attended the Seventh-day Adventist Church
with her grandmother and later with her mother. When she was 17 she was
baptized. But she wasn’t sure how to explain her faith to her friend Nadia.
   Then one day Nadia invited Galina to her birthday party in a nearby
disco. Galina convinced herself that by going she was showing respect
to her friend. At first the music was soft, and the young people chatted.
Then the dancing began. While everyone else danced, Galina remained
at the table.
   A boy sitting at the table noticed Galina and asked, “Why aren’t you
dancing? Don’t you know how?” Galina told him that she could dance, but
she chose not to dance socially. She mentioned God in her explanation.
   The boy started asking Galina questions about her faith. People came
and went from the table, but Galina and her new friend kept talking. At
1:00 a.m., the young people were asked to leave because the disco was
closing. The last of the young people lived in an apartment block near the
club, so they walked home together.
   Galina and her new friend continued talking as they walked home. The
others noticed and listened. The 30-minute walk home took more than an
hour. As they approached their apartments, they sat down and continued
talking about God, His love, His expectations, and their response to God.
They talked for three more hours. Finally, they arranged to meet another
day and continue the conversation.
   A few days later, the group met at Nadia’s apartment. Galina took her
boyfriend to help her answer questions. The other four young people were
burning with questions. Galina and her boyfriend gave them some books
to read. Nadia and her brother, Stoyen, continued asking questions, and
eventually they visited the church.
   Stoyen was the first to show serious interest in God, and a few months
later he was baptized. His parents opposed his new faith, for they had been
communists. Nadia took more time to make a decision for Christ, but she
eventually was baptized as well.
   Today Stoyen and Nadia are active in church. And Galina has learned
an important lesson. “We must not be ashamed to share our faith,” she
says. “My best friend and her brother are Christians today because I reluc-
tantly shared my faith.”
   Our mission offerings help train young people and adults alike to share
their faith with others. Thank you!

      Happy Are You, O Israel!

		




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Leviticus 9; 10:1–11;
      Rev. 20:9; Deut. 33:26–29; 1 Samuel 1; 15:22, 23.

Memory Text: “Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil;
      who put darkness for light, and light for darkness; who put bit-
      ter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! Woe to those who are wise in
      their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!” (Isaiah 5:20, 21,
      NKJV).



      I
          n cultures focused on individuality, it is so easy to forget what
          must always be the starting point of all worship: the action of God
          in history. Authentic worship should be the Christian’s heartfelt
      response to God’s mighty acts, both in Creation and in Redemption
      (again, the first angel’s message motif). True worship comes from our
      response to God’s love and should impact every area of our lives. In
      the end, authentic worship is not just what we do on Sabbath; it should
      permeate all areas of our lives and not just in church.
         Especially in our desire to be relevant, it is so easy to shift the
      focus of worship solely onto ourselves, our needs, our desires, and our
      wants. And though worship should be personally satisfying, the dan-
      ger comes from how we seek to experience that satisfaction. Only in
      the Lord, only in the One who created and redeemed us, can we find
      true satisfaction, as much as is possible in a sinful, fallen world.
         This week we will look further at some of the lessons about true
      worship that we can learn from Israel’s history, both from the good
      things that happened and from the bad.

     The Dedication
       Seven days of consecration had passed (see Leviticus 8). On the
     eighth day the priests entered their sacred ministry in the sanctuary.
     They were starting a work that would continue (though not without
     interruption) for more than fourteen hundred years, a work that prefig-
     ured the work of Christ in the heavenly sanctuary, the true sanctuary
     where Christ now ministers on our behalf.

Read Leviticus 9. What elements appear here that teach us about
     worship? That is, what truths are taught by the various rituals that
     help us understand the work of God for humanity and why we wor-
     ship Him? For example, what does the work of “atonement” teach
     us about what God has done for us and why we worship Him?

       Verses 22–24 are especially fascinating. It is hard to imagine what
     must have gone on in the minds and hearts of Moses and Aaron as
     they entered the sanctuary and then came out, only to have “the glory
     of the Lord” appear before all the people. Though the text does not say
     what exactly happened, there were a lot of people in the camp at that
     time, and for all of them to have seen it means that it must have been
     something spectacular. Perhaps the glory was manifested by what
     happened next: “and fire came out from before the Lord and con-
     sumed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar. When all the people
     saw it, they shouted and fell on their faces” (Lev. 9:24, NKJV).
       The tabernacle had been dedicated and the priests consecrated to
     the service of divine worship. Holy fire appeared as a token that the
     sacrifice had been accepted. The people responded in unison—with a
     shout of praise, and then fell on their faces in humility before the glory
     of God’s holy presence. What we see here is intense reverence, awe,
     and obedience; every detail of God’s commands were followed, and
     the Lord showed His acceptance of what they had done.

      Notice their reaction: they shouted and also fell on their faces.
      However intense the whole service was, their reaction was one
      of reverence, joy, and fear—all at the same time. How can we
      learn to manifest this kind of reverence and joy in our own
      worship services?
                                                                           39

     Fire From Before the Lord
       “Assisted by his sons, Aaron offered the sacrifices that God
     required, and he lifted up his hands and blessed the people. All had
     been done as God commanded, and He accepted the sacrifice, and
     revealed His glory in a remarkable manner; fire came from the Lord
     and consumed the offering upon the altar. The people looked upon
     this wonderful manifestation of divine power with awe and intense
     interest. They saw in it a token of God’s glory and favor, and they
     raised a universal shout of praise and adoration and fell on their
     faces as if in the immediate presence of Jehovah.”—Ellen G. White,
     Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 359. It is hard to believe that after
     something so dramatic, a terrible fall would immediately follow.
     One would have thought that with such a demonstration of God’s
     power, all the people, particularly the priests (especially priests as
     highly honored as these), would have fallen strictly in line. How
     foolish we are to ever underestimate the corruption of the human
     heart, especially our own!

Read the story of Nadab and Abihu in Leviticus 10:1–11. Who were
     they? What was their sin? Compare Exod. 30:9, Lev. 16:12, 10:9.
     After what just happened in the previous chapter, what signifi-
     cance is found in how they died? What important gospel lesson
     can we learn from this tragic story?

       The Hebrew wording in both Leviticus 9:24 and 10:2 was the
     same: “and fire came out from before the Lord and consumed” (9:24,
     NKJV). Consumed what? In the first case, the offering; in the other,
     the sinners. What a powerful representation of the plan of salvation.
     At the Cross, the “fire from God,” the wrath of God, “consumed”
     the offering, and that was Jesus. Thus, all who put their faith in Him
     never have to face that fire, that wrath, because a substitute did it
     for them. Those, however, like these priests, who reject God’s way
     for their own, will have to face that fire themselves (Rev. 20:9). The
     same glory that was revealed at the Cross will be the glory that,
     in the end, destroys sin. What a stark and unambiguous choice is
     before us all.

      In one sense, if you think about it, fire is fire. What is the dif-
      ference? Obviously, in this case, it was a big one. Think about
      not just how you worship but your life in general. What, if any,
      “strange fires” might you need to put out in your life?

     Happy Are You, O Israel
       Picture the scene: the faithful servant Moses, rebuked by the Lord
     for his outburst of anger, stands before the nation of Israel (Num.
     20:8–12).
       Later on, Moses knows that he is soon to die. How easily he could
     have wallowed in self-pity and frustration. Even then, however, his
     thoughts were for his people and for the future they were to face.
     Standing before the people as their leader for the last time, Moses,
     under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, pronounced a blessing on
     each tribe. He then ended with a benediction.

Read Deuteronomy 33:26–29. What is Moses saying here that can
     help us better understand what it means to worship the Lord?
     What truths, what principles, can we apply as we seek to learn
     more about what true worship is?

        The word Yeshurun is a poetic term for Israel (see Deut. 33:5, 26).
     It comes from a root word (yashar) meaning “upright” or “straight,”
     not merely physically but also morally. Job was described (Job 1:1)
     as “perfect and upright” (from yashar); see also Psalms 32:11, 97:11,
     and Proverbs 15:8. Hence, Moses is talking about what God’s people
     ideally should be like, those who have entered into a covenant rela-
     tionship with Him.
        As always, the key focus here is upon God’s acts on behalf of His
     people. All of the things that will happen to Israel—victory over enemies,
     safety, salvation, the fruit of the land—is theirs because of what the Lord
     has done for them. How crucial that they never forget these important
     truths. Among many of the things that worship can do for us is that it can
     be a constant reminder of what “the God of Jeshurun” has done for us.
     Praise, worship, and adoration—whether coming verbally from our lips
     or expressed in the thoughts of the heart and mind—can go a long way in
     helping us keep focused on God and not on ourselves and our problems.

      Think about all that you have to praise and worship the Lord
      for. Why is it so important to keep all these blessings, all that
      He has done on your behalf, before you at all times? Otherwise,
      how easy is it to fall into discouragement?
                                                                            41

     An Attitude of Surrender
        Worship, in the Bible, is serious business. It is not a matter of per-
     sonal taste, nor is it a matter of doing one’s own thing or following
     one’s own proclivities. There is always the danger of falling into dead
     rituals and traditions that become ends in themselves instead of the
     means to an end—and that end is true worship of the Lord in a way
     that changes our lives and brings us into conformity with His will and
     character (Gal. 4:19). We must be careful not to allow self-exaltation,
     sinful gratification, and a desire for personal glory to dictate how we
     worship.
        We now jump ahead a number of years in Israelite history and read
     a simple story that can help reveal to us how true worship can be
     expressed in the heart of a penitent soul.

Read 1 Samuel 1, the story of Hannah. What can we take from her
     experience that helps us understand the meaning of worship and
     how we are to worship the Lord?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       However much we must remember that God Himself should be the
     focus of our worship, we do not worship God in a vacuum. We are
     not worshiping a distant, far off, abstract being; we are worshiping the
     God who created and redeemed us and who interacts in human affairs.
     We are worshiping a personal God who intervenes in our lives in the
     most intimate ways, ways that will help us with our deepest needs if
     we allow Him 10.
        Hannah worshiped the Lord from the most hollow recesses of her
     soul. In a sense, we are all like Hannah. We all have heartfelt and deep
     needs that, in and of ourselves, we cannot meet. Hannah came before
     the Lord in an attitude of complete self-surrender. (After all, how
     much more self-surrender could one find than to be willing to give up
     your child?) We can, and should, come before God with our needs;
     but we always must make those needs subordinate to the Lord’s call-
     ing in our lives. True worship should flow from a broken heart totally
     aware of its own helplessness and dependence upon God.

      What are the broken places inside you? How can you learn to
      give them to the Lord?

     Worship and Obedience
       “And Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt
     offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord?
     Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the
     fat of rams. For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stub-
     bornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected
     the word of the Lord, he hath also rejected thee from being king”
     (1 Sam. 15:22, 23).

Read the above passage. What crucial principle can we take away
     from it concerning what constitutes true worship? What does
     it warn us against? How can we make sure we are not guilty of
     exactly what these verses warn about?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Those verses unfold in the context of the continued downfall and
     apostasy of Saul, Israel’s first king. Saul was to attack and utterly
     destroy (the Hebrew word suggests “dedicated to destruction”) every
     person, every animal. God planned to use Israel to bring judgment
     on this wicked nation, the Amalekites, that in mercy He had delayed
     for some three centuries. Despite explicit instruction about what to
     do, Saul openly disobeyed (1 Sam. 15:1–21), and now he was going
     to reap the consequences of his actions. Samuel’s answer to Saul in
     verses 22 and 23 helps us better understand what real worship should
     be about.
        1. God would rather have our hearts than our offerings. (If He truly
     has our hearts, the offerings will follow.)
        2. Obedience is more pleasing to Him than are sacrifices. (Obedience
     is our way of showing that we understand what the sacrifices are truly
     about.)
        3. Stubbornness, insisting on our own way, is idolatry because we
     have made a god of ourselves, our desires, and our opinions.

      Allow the Holy Spirit to speak to your heart as you ask your-
      self the following: In what areas in my life may I be choosing
      to follow my own desires and opinions rather than letting God
      lead me? What applications can I make to my worship experi-
      ence from the example of Saul in his fatal presumptions?

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Sin of Nadab and Abihu,”
         pp. 359–362; “The Presumption of Saul,” pp. 616–626, in Patriarchs
         and Prophets.

           “God has pronounced a curse upon those who depart from His
         commandments, and put no difference between common and holy
         things.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 360.

           “[Saul’s] fatal presumption must be attributed to satanic sorcery.
         Saul had manifested great zeal in suppressing idolatry and witchcraft;
         yet in his disobedience to the divine command he had been actuated
         by the same spirit of opposition to God and had been as really inspired
         by Satan as are those who practice sorcery; and when reproved, he
         had added stubbornness to rebellion. He could have offered no greater
2
         insult to the Spirit of God had he openly united with idolaters.”
         —Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 635.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Why is it so important in worship to truly keep Christ as the
          center? However subtle, what other things can come in and take
          our focus off the Lord as we worship? In what ways might we be
          in danger of using the Lord, or the name of the Lord in praise
3         and song, as merely a cover for the worship of something else?

          l2 What are ways that we can be hypocritical in worship? That
          is, what does it say about us if, when outside of church itself we
          act one way and then inside church we are full of praise and
          adoration and worship? Though none of us is perfect, shouldn’t
          the lives we lead be connected with the kind of worship we prac-
          tice? Sadly, some people go to church, “worship,” and then go
          home and abuse their spouses and children or engage in other
          evil behavior. How do such practices make a mockery of our
          worship?

          l
          3 Go back over the memory verse for this week and apply it in
          the context of worship. How can we be sure that we are not doing
          exactly what we are being warned against here?

          l
          4 How can you better learn the art of worship, the art of self-
          surrender to the Lord? How can you learn to draw closer to the
          Lord in your own private time of worship?

Teaching the Teacher
by Jacqueline Thermil
   Dieuseul Placid was one of my teachers in secondary school. After I
graduated, I studied theology at Haiti Adventist University. Later, when I
returned to my home, a church elder asked me to visit my former teacher.
“He’s interested in the Adventist faith,” the elder said. I visited my teacher
and heard his interesting story.
   “My friends and I sometimes talk about voodoo,” Dieuseul told me. “I
don’t practice voodoo, but I wanted to know about it. One day my friend
told me that he could kill anyone through evil spirits.
   “Another man disagreed and told us that a good Christian—especially
a good Seventh-day Adventist—is immune to the evil spirits. I asked my
friend what’s so special about Adventists that they are immune to the
devil’s power. My friend explained that Adventists follow the Bible and
teach God’s straight truths. They are powerful in prayer and can even cast
out spirits from people who are possessed. I wondered about the secret
that made these Adventists resistant to the devil’s power.”
   After Dieuseul related his conversation to me, he asked me to study the
Bible with him. I gladly agreed. He warned me that he was studying with
several other denominations to see which one was the right church. I was
glad, for I knew he was searching for truth.
   After a few Bible studies, Dieuseul asked me to meet the others with
whom he was studying so we could talk about doctrine. I agreed. When
we met, Dieuseul asked to talk about the law and how it reflects God’s
character and His love. But the other believers refused to discuss the law
of God for various reasons. They wanted to talk about grace instead. But
Dieuseul insisted, and before long the others closed their books and left.
   We continued studying, and in a short time Dieuseul became convinced
                            of the Bible’s clear and plain truths and asked
                            to become a member of the Adventist Church.
                            He was baptized and today is an elder in his
                            church. The devil lost the argument, and today
                            Dieuseul truly is God’s unique son.
                               I thank God for honest-hearted souls, such
                            as my former teacher, who are willing to rec-
                            ognize God’s voice and follow His leading.
                            I thank God, too, for your mission offerings,
                            which help build up the church in Haiti, one of
                            the poorest countries in the world.

               ing David’s life is recorded in the Bible for many reasons: not
               only does an important part of Israelite history center on his
               life and reign, but we can learn many spiritual lessons from
      him, both from his good deeds and his bad.
         This week we will start out using some examples from David and
      his life in order to delve more into the question of worship: what it
      means, how we should do it, and what it should do for us. For in
      David we can see many examples of worship and song and praise.
      These things were a crucial part of his life and of his experience with
      the Lord.
         Thus, it must be with us, as well, especially if we constantly
      remember that the first angel’s message is a call to worship. What
      does it mean “to worship”? How do we do it? Why do we do it? What
      role does music play in worship? What distinguishes true worship
      from false worship?
         These all are themes that we will touch on in various ways this
      quarter as we heed the call: “O come, let us worship and bow down:
      let us kneel before the Lord our maker. For he is our God; and we are
      the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand” (Ps. 95:6, 7).

      Between Saul and David
Read the following glimpses into David’s life before he became king:
      1 Samuel 16:6–13, 17:45–47, 18:14, 24:10, 26:9, 30:6–8. What
      does this tell us about David?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         God chose Saul as the first king of Israel because he matched the
      description the people had requested. But when God chose David to
      be the next king of Israel, He reminded Samuel that the Lord looks on
      the heart (1 Sam. 16:7).
         David was far from being perfect. In fact, some would argue that
      David’s later moral lapses were much more serious than Saul’s sins.
      Yet, the Lord rejected Saul but forgave even David’s worst mistakes,
      allowing him to continue being king. What made the difference?

See Psalms 32:1–5, 51:1–6. What crucial concept is found in these
      texts that is so central to faith?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        God is in the heart business. He not only reads the heart—the
      center of thought, inner attitudes, and motives—but He can touch
      and change hearts that are open to Him. David’s heart yielded to the
      conviction of sin. He repented, and he patiently accepted the conse-
      quences of his sins. In contrast, whatever outward confessions Saul
      made, it was clear that his heart was not surrendered to the Lord. “Yet
      the Lord, having placed on Saul the responsibility of the kingdom, did
      not leave him to himself. He caused the Holy Spirit to rest upon Saul
      to reveal to him his own weakness and his need of divine grace; and
      had Saul relied upon God, God would have been with him. So long
      as his will was controlled by the will of God, so long as he yielded to
      the discipline of His Spirit, God could crown his efforts with success.
      But when Saul chose to act independently of God, the Lord could
      no longer be his guide, and was forced to set him aside.”—Ellen G.
      White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 636.

       Ask yourself, how does what goes on inside your heart differ
       from what people see of you on the outside? What does your
       answer say to you about yourself?

     A Broken Heart, a Broken Spirit
       “The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite
     heart—these, O God, You will not despise” (Ps. 51:17, NKJV). Think
     about these words of David, but in the context of worship. (After all,
     in ancient Israel, worship centered around the sacrifice.) Realize, too,
     that the word translated “contrite” comes from a Hebrew word that
     means “crushed.” What is the Lord saying to us here? How are we
     to understand this idea along with the idea that there should be joy in
     our worship? Why are these two contrasting concepts not necessarily
     contradictory?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

         As Christians, we take it as a given (or at least we should) that all of
     humanity is fallen, sinful, degraded. This degradation and sinfulness
     includes each one of us, individually. Think of the contrast between
     what you know you could be and what you are; the contrast between
     the kind of thoughts you think and the kind you know that you should
     think; the contrast between what you do and what you should do,
     between what you do not do and what you know that you should. As
     Christians, with the biblical standard of Jesus before us, the personal
     realization of our true nature can be especially devastating. This is
     where our broken spirit and crushed and broken hearts come from. If
     those professing to be Christians do not see this, they are truly blind;
     most likely they have not had a conversion experience or have lost
     it.
         Yet, the joy comes from knowing that, despite our fallen state, God
     loves us so much that Christ came and died, offering Himself for us,
     and that His perfect life, His perfect holiness, His perfect character,
     becomes credited to us by faith. Again, the theme of the “everlasting
     gospel” (Rev. 14:6) appears. Our worship should center not just on
     our own sinfulness but on God’s amazing solution to it: the Cross. Of
     course, we need that broken and crushed heart, but we always need to
     frame that sad reality against the background of what God has done
     for us in Christ. In fact, the realization of how bad we are leads to
     joy, because we know that, despite our state, we can have eternal life
     anyway, and that because of Jesus, God will not count our transgres-
     sions against us. This is a truth that must always be at the center of all
     worship experiences, whether corporate or private.

     David: A Song of Praise and Worship
       David’s understanding of God and the salvation He offered shaped
     not only his own life but his spiritual leadership and influence over
     his people. His songs and prayers reflect a deep sense of awe for the
     God he loved and knew as a personal friend and Savior.
       According to 1 Chronicles 16:7, David presented to Asaph, his
     chief musician, a new song of thanksgiving and praise on the day
     that the ark was moved to Jerusalem. This praise psalm consists
     of two important aspects of worship: the revelation of God as One
     worthy of worship and the appropriate response of the worshiper.
     In this song, David first calls worshipers to active participation in
     worship.
       Read the entire song in 1 Chronicles 16:8–36. Notice how often
     the following action words and expressions are used, especially in
     the first part of the song: give thanks, sing, call on His name, seek
     the Lord, make known, talk of, declare, give glory to, proclaim,
     remember, and bring an offering. David then recited some of the
     reasons why God is worthy of our praise and worship.

What were some of the events of the past that the people of Israel
     were to make known to others? 1 Chron. 16:8, 12, 16–22. What
     special acts of God were they to remember? Vss. 12, 15.

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

The psalmist’s rehearsal of the covenant takes up nearly a third of
     this thanksgiving hymn. In what way does the covenant relate to
     worship?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       The covenant God made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob was based
     on His ability, as their Ruler, to make them a great nation, to bless
     them, and to bring them into the Promised Land. Their part was to
     love, obey, and worship Him as their Father and God. However dif-
     ferent our context today may be, the same principle still holds.

      Meditate on the ways David calls us to worship God. In our own
      time, place, and context, how can these same ideas be reflected
      in our corporate worship of the Lord?

     David’s Song
       “When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God
     shouted for joy” (Job 38:7).

       Second Samuel 22 records a song that David wrote in praise of the
     Lord. (Skim through the song and note the key elements and how
     they are linked to worship.) The key point here, and in so many other
     places in the Bible, is that this was a song. It was music. All through
     Scripture, we find music as an integral part of worship. According
     to the text above, the angels sang in response to the creation of the
     world.

Read Revelation 4:9–11, 5:9–13, 7:10–12, 14:1–3. What does this
     tell us about some things that go on in the sinless environment of
     heaven? What are some of the themes expressed here, and what
     can we learn from them about worship?

        Central to the theme of the songs and praise and adoration is Jesus
     as Creator and as Redeemer. If they sing about that in heaven, how
     much more so should we be doing that here on earth?
        There is no question that song and music and praise are part of our
     worship experience. As creatures made in God’s image, we share a
     love and an appreciation for music, as do other intelligent beings. It
     is hard to imagine a culture that does not use music in some way or
     another, for some purpose or another. Love and appreciation of music
     are woven into the very fabric of our human existence; God surely
     made us that way.
        Music has the power to touch us and move us that other forms of
     communication do not seem to have. At its purest and finest, music
     seems to lift us into the very presence of the Lord. Who has not expe-
     rienced, at some point, the power of music to bring us closer to our
     Maker?

      What has been your own spiritual experience with the power
      of music? What kind of music do you listen to, and how does it
      impact your relationship with the Lord?

      “Sing a New Song to the Lord!”
         Unfortunately, though we have access to some of the themes and
      lyrics of divinely inspired songs, we do not have any of the music
      itself. Thus, using our God-given gifts (at least, those of us who have
      those gifts), we write our own music if not always our own lyrics.
      But as we all know, we do not do this in a vacuum. We worship in
      relationship to the culture we live in, a culture that to some degree
      influences us and our music. This can be a good thing, or this can be
      a bad thing. The hard thing is to know the difference.

Read the following texts. How can they give us principles that should
      guide us in the kind of music we have in our worship? 1 Cor.
      10:31, Phil. 4:8, Col. 1:18.

        Over the years, the question of music and types of music in wor-
      ship has arisen in our church. In some cases, hymnal music has been
      given all but sacred status; in others, it is hard to tell the difference
      between what is being played in church and what is being played as
      secular music.
        What is important for worship music is that it point us to the noblest
      and the best, which is the Lord. It should appeal, not to the baser
      elements of our being but to the higher ones. Music is not morally
      neutral: it can move us to some of the most exalted spiritual experi-
      ences, or it can be used by the enemy to debase and degrade us, to
      bring out lusts and passion and despair and anger. All one has to do is
      look at what some of the music industry today produces to see power-
      ful examples of how Satan has perverted another of God’s wonderful
      gifts to humanity.
         Music in our worship services should have a balance of spiritual,
      intellectual, and emotional elements. The lyrics, in harmony with the
      music itself, should uplift us, elevate our thoughts, and make us long
      more for the Lord who has done so much for us. Music that can bring
      us to the foot of the cross, that can help us realize what we have been
      given in Christ, is the kind we need for our worship.
        Again, various cultures have different tastes in music, and music and
      musical instruments vary in our worldwide family. What is uplifting
      and encouraging to those in one culture might sound strange to those
      in another. Either way, how important it is that we seek the Lord’s
      guidance in having appropriate music for our worship services.
                                                                           51

    Further Study: “Let the subject be made distinct and plain that
         it is not possible to effect anything in our standing before God or in
         the gift of God to us through creature merit. Should faith and works
         purchase the gift of salvation for anyone, then the Creator is under
         obligation to the creature. Here is an opportunity for falsehood to
1
         be accepted as truth. If any man can merit salvation by anything he
         may do, then he is in the same position as the Catholic to do penance
         for his sins. Salvation, then, is partly of debt, that may be earned as
         wages. If man cannot, by any of his good works, merit salvation, then
         it must be wholly of grace, received by man as a sinner because he
         receives and believes in Jesus. It is wholly a free gift. Justification by
2        faith is placed beyond controversy. And all this controversy is ended,
         as soon as the matter is settled that the merits of fallen man in his good
         works can never procure eternal life for him.”—Ellen G. White, Faith
         and Works, pp. 19, 20.
            Music “is one of the most effective means of impressing the heart
         with spiritual truth. How often to the soul hard pressed and ready to
         despair, memory recalls some word of God’s—the long-forgotten
         burden of a childhood song—and temptations lose their power, life
3
         takes on new meaning and new purpose, and courage and gladness
         are imparted to other souls! . . .
            “As a part of religious service, singing is as much an act of worship
         as is prayer. Indeed, many a song is prayer. . . .
             “As our Redeemer leads us to the threshold of the Infinite, flushed
         with the glory of God, we may catch the themes of praise and thanks-
         giving from the heavenly choir round about the throne; and as the
         echo of the angels’ song is awakened in our earthly homes, hearts will
         be drawn closer to the heavenly singers. Heaven’s communion begins
         on earth. We learn here the keynote of its praise.”—Ellen G. White,
         Education, p. 168.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 In what ways do your culture and society impact the music in
          your church, or do you deny that it does?

          2 Read the Ellen White quote in Friday’s study about music.
          How much of this do you experience with the kind of music that
          is part of your church’s worship service? What are ways that
          we can evaluate the role of music in our church services? How
          can your church members work together to make sure that the
          music is, indeed, uplifting and encouraging, fulfilling the role
          that it should?

Stubborn Faith
by JoAnne Lafever
   “What? You’re not going to attend the study session on Friday night!”
Wa Wa’s English teacher, Mr. Peter, almost shouted at her. Wa Wa stud-
ied hard throughout high school, and ranked near the top of her class. But
she loved God more than grades, and she had great faith that He would
help her pass her tests so she could study at a good university.
   The pressure to score well on tests mounted as Wa Wa entered her last
year of high school. Teachers offered extra study sessions to help their
best students score even higher. High test scores brought prestige to the
schools and increased students’ chances to enter their choice of univer-
sities. Mr. Peter noticed when Wa Wa didn’t attend study sessions on
Friday evenings or Saturdays. He encouraged her, pleaded with her, and
even scolded her in an attempt to get her to attend the sessions. But she
refused.
   “No, on Sabbath, from sundown Friday till sundown on Saturday, I
worship my God,” she told her teacher. Wa Wa was positive that God
would help her do well on her tests if she was faithful to Him.
   Eventually, Mr. Peter realized that he couldn’t change her mind. He
respected her determination, though he didn’t understand her religion.
   When Wa Wa’s classmates learned of her refusal, they were shocked.
But they, too, saw Wa Wa’s determination and accepted her decision to
skip study sessions.
   When the students’ test scores arrived, Wa Wa had scored in the top 10
percent of her class, even without the additional study sessions. Her teach-
ers were shocked. Her classmates were shocked. “You haven’t studied
nearly enough to do this well!” some said.
   But Wa Wa wasn’t shocked. “I trust in God,” she told them. “He is a
powerful God. I knew that He would help me.”
   Wa Wa was accepted at a good university near her home in Taipei,
Taiwan. She testifies to her classmates and teachers that God is leading in
her life. And she continues to keep the Sabbath and worship God rather
than attend classes and study sessions on His holy day.
   One in every 4,300 people in Taiwan is a Seventh-day Adventist.
Among the ethnic Chinese, only 1 in every 25,000 is an Adventist. Our
mission offerings help spread the message of God’s love through the
Adventist hospital, Adventist schools, health programs, and local evange-
listic outreach in this nation.

      Worship in the Psalms
		



				




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Psalms 90:1, 2; 100:1–5;
      73; 49; 141:2; 20:3; 54:6; 78:1–8.

Memory Text: “How lovely is your dwelling place, O Lord
      Almighty! My soul yearns, even faints, for the courts of the Lord;
      my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God” (Psalm 84:1,
      2, NIV).



      T
             he Hebrew word translated “Psalms” comes from a root word
             that means “to sing with instrumental accompaniment.” Thus, the
             Psalms were songs, songs that were intricately part of the worship
      of Israel. Though we have the lyrics (the Psalms themselves), we do not
      have the music. How fascinating it would be to hear these songs, in their
      original tongue, sung with the music that first accompanied them.
        The Psalms themselves are rich and deep, covering a wide range of
      topics and emotions, dealing with everything from the corporate his-
      tory of Israel to the songwriter’s most intimate and personal pain. In
      that sense, they speak to us because, though as a church we are part of
      the long history that goes back to Israel, we also are individuals with
      our own private pain. It is doubtful that any of us could not relate at
      some time or another to some of the agony expressed in the Psalms.
      At the same time, though, it is crucial that we reach out and grasp the
      hope expressed in them.
        This week we will look at the Psalms and some of the themes found
      in them and how these themes relate to the question of worship and
      what it means for us today.

     Worship the Lord, Our Maker
       The psalms of praise describe who God is and why He is worthy
     of worship. They declare His greatness, and call worshipers to come
     with joyful adoration to honor Him.

What do the following examples have in common? Pss. 90:1, 2;
     95:1–6; 100:1–5.
     _______________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________

Psalm 19 is another song in praise of God as Creator. What is its
     essential message, and why is that especially important for us
     today, at a time when many argue that we exist only as the result
     of natural and unguided forces that created us by chance alone?
     _______________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________

Notice how the psalmist suddenly shifts from discussing God’s
     glory revealed in the heavens to His revealed word. This abrupt
     transition is intentional. Read John 1:1–3; Col. 1:16, 17; Heb.
     1:1–3. What great truth is the psalmist emphasizing?
     _______________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________

        The same God who spoke the world into existence also gave the moral,
     physical, and social laws to govern the human family. The Old Testament
     Scriptures clearly identify God as both the Creator of the world and the
     Giver of the Written Law. The New Testament writers see Jesus Christ as
     the Creator and the Giver of the Law as well as the Word made flesh, who
     lived among His creatures in order to reveal the Father to them and to die
     as their Substitute. Thus, He alone is worthy of adoration and worship.
        Hence, we see in the Psalms one of the foundational principles of
     worship as seen in the first angel’s message (Rev. 14:7). We worship the
     Lord because He is our Creator, and directly tied to His role as Creator
     is His role as our Redeemer (Rev. 14:6). Creator and Redeemer—if
     these are not reasons to praise and worship Him, what are?

      How can you seek to get to know the Lord better through His
      created works?

     Judgment From His Sanctuary
        While many psalms were written for public worship, many others
     are prayers of personal distress and suffering. These laments typically
     contain a description of the problem, the sufferer’s plea for help, and
     an affirmation of, and reasons for, the writer’s trust in God.
        In Psalm 73, the petitioner is angry that the wicked prosper and are
     at ease while he suffers injustice.

Read the psalmist’s complaint in Psalm 73. What happened that
     brought about a change in his attitude toward the problem? What
     message can we take from that for ourselves, as Seventh-day
     Adventists, with our understanding of Christ’s ministry in the
     heavenly sanctuary and the truths about God and the plan of sal-
     vation that this ministry reveals? See Dan. 7:9, 10, 13, 14, 25, 26.

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Judgment in the Psalms, as in the Bible as a whole, is a double-
     edged sword: deserved punishment on the wicked and the defense
     of the oppressed and humble (Pss. 7:9, 10; 9:7–12; 75:2; 94:1–3,
     20–22; 98:9). In Psalm 68:24, the wicked are pictured as watching
     God enter the sanctuary in a grand processional. God’s throne, repre-
     senting justice and mercy, is symbolized in the ark of the covenant in
     the Most Holy Place of the sanctuary. Thus, the sanctuary, the place
     of worship, becomes a haven of refuge for the distressed.
        Here, too, we see the theme of judgment echoed in the first angel’s
     message: “Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him;
     for the hour of his judgment is come . . .” (Rev. 14:7). One of the things
     about God, about what makes Him so worthy of our worship, is that we
     can indeed trust that in the end, not only will judgment come but it will
     be just and righteous, nothing like the fallible and imperfect justice meted
     out even in the best human courts. From the death of Abel, whose blood
     cried out from the ground (Gen. 4:10), up through today and on to the last
     day of fallen human history, the crimes, the unfairness, and the inequities
     of this world do indeed cry out for justice. The good news is that we can
     trust that, in His time and way, God will make all things right, however
     hard it is for us to see and understand now (see 1 Cor. 4:5).

      Have you seen injustice? Have you been the victim of injustice?
      What are ways that you can learn to trust in God, to trust in
      the promise of ultimate and righteous justice that is so lacking
      in the world now?

     “Like the Beasts That Perish”
        As we saw yesterday, and as we all know too well, so much unfair-
     ness and injustice reign in this world. A relatively small percentage
     of people live in luxury, in contrast to vast multitudes who struggle to
     barely eke out an existence. The gap between the rich and poor seems
     steadily to grow; and what makes it worse is that so often the rich
     get richer by exploiting the poor. All through the Bible, the Lord has
     warned about this exploitation and injustice. Those who are guilty of
     such exploitation, and who do not repent and turn away, will have a
     lot to answer for on Judgment Day.

Read Psalm 49. How does it tie in with what we read yesterday?
     What is the basic message of this psalm? Where do we find the
     gospel here? What ultimate and final hope is presented?
     _______________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________

        It is so easy to get caught up in the things of this world, especially
     if you have many things in this world as do the rich. Yet, as the psalm
     says, and as we all should know by now, the things of this world are
     so fleeting, so temporary, so easily lost. Overnight, everything you
     have worked for, everything you have struggled to attain, everything
     that is important to you, can be taken away, lost, destroyed. We all
     live on the edge of a precipice, at least in this life. Fortunately, as this
     psalm shows, and as so much of the rest of the Bible attests, this life
     is not all that there is.

Focus on verses 7–9 of this psalm. Given the immediate context,
     what is it saying? How does it show how all of us, rich or poor, are
     ultimately dependent upon Christ for salvation?
     _______________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________

      Do you ever find yourself jealous of those who have more than
      you do? If so, why is it so important to surrender those feel-
      ings to the Lord? How do such emotions interfere with your
      spiritual life, with your relationship to God, and your faith in
      general? How can focusing on Jesus, the Cross, and salvation
      help free you from the tyranny of jealousy?

     Worship and the Sanctuary
        “Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the
     lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice” (Ps. 141:2). What
     imagery is being used here? What is this verse pointing to?
     _______________________________________________________

      The entire Old Testament sanctuary service centered on the concept
     of sacrifice. However much the enemy of souls perverted it, even to
     the point where people were sacrificing their own children in order
     (they believed) to appease an angry god (or gods), the sacrificial
     system was intended to point to the death of Jesus on behalf of all
     humanity. It was to show the futility of our own works to save us; it
     was to show that the cost of sin was the life of an innocent victim; it
     was to show that the Lord had a plan whereby sinners could be for-
     given, cleansed, and accepted by the Lord through His grace.
        It is no wonder, then, that many of the psalms, so central to Israel’s
     worship, would use images and examples from the sanctuary service.
     See Pss. 20:3, 43:4, 51:19, 54:6, 118:27, 134:2, 141:2.
        Dwell on the sanctuary service: the sacrifice of the animals, the
     ministry of the priests, the furniture in the courtyard, and the Holy and
     Most Holy Places. What sacred truths can we draw from this earthly
     and temporary system about the work of Jesus on our behalf? Why
     should these truths be so central to our worship of the Lord?
     _______________________________________________________

Read Psalm 40:6–8 and Hebrews 10:1–13. How does Paul connect
     Psalm 40:8 with the sacrificial system?
     _______________________________________________________

        The author’s point is that it is through Christ, not through the death
     of animals, that we have salvation. Only through Christ is there true
     forgiveness of sin. The whole earthly system was merely a precursor
     to what Jesus would do on behalf of all humanity. He was telling his
     audience, most likely Jewish believers in Jesus, that they needed to
     look away from the earthly system and instead focus their attention
     and worship on Jesus. In other words, though the whole sanctuary
     service was to point to Christ, as believers they needed to move away
     from the symbols toward the reality, which was Jesus and His minis-
     try for them in the heavenly sanctuary after His atoning death.

      How can we be sure that we do not make worship and the
      things of worship ends in themselves? How can we make sure
      that every aspect of our worship points us toward Jesus and His
      work on our behalf?

     Lest We Forget!
       Three of the longer psalms, Psalms 78, 105, and 106, are great
     hymns that were to be sung or recited to remind Israel of God’s lead-
     ing in the past.

Read Psalm 78:1–8. According to this passage, why does God want
     the people to remember their history? Read also Deut. 6:6–9,
     1 Cor. 10:11. How can we take that same principle and apply it to
     ourselves in our own context and experience, which is so different
     from theirs?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       One of the ways God reveals Himself is through history. Yet, each
     generation must experience Him anew based on that history. For that
     reason, not only music but the proclamation of the Word of God in wor-
     ship is vital to both old and new generations to keep before them His
     past leading. Psalm 78 is a warning that history must not repeat itself,
     but at the same time it is a heartwarming reminder of God’s gracious
     dealings with His wayward people. There seems to be an urgency in
     the imperative promise, “Telling to the generation to come the praises
     of the Lord, and His strength” (vs. 4, NKJV). Psalm 105:2 calls us to
     “Sing psalms to Him” and “Talk of all His wondrous works” (NKJV;
     emphasis added).
       The longest poem in the psalter, Psalm 119, contains the frequent
     refrain, “Teach me thy statutes,” indicating the importance of Scripture
     as the basis for teaching godly living and righteousness. Paul echoes
     this thought when he instructs the young preacher, Timothy, “All
     Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine,
     for reproof, for correction, for instruction” (2 Tim. 3:16, NKJV).
       Paul charges Timothy to “preach the word” (2 Tim. 4:2, NKJV).
     To neglect proclaiming the Word in worship is to dilute the power of
     the gospel to reach hearts, to change lives, and to enrich the worship
     experience of believers.

      How often have you had the experience of the Lord doing some-
      thing wonderful and miraculous in your life, only to quickly
      forget it and show fear and lack of faith when a new crisis
      arose? Whether in corporate worship or in your own private
      worship, how can you learn to keep fresh in your mind God’s
      leading in your life? Why is this so important to do?

         heaven. It reaches from the lowest depths of human agony and suf-
1        fering to the highest joys of communion with God. Laments and cries
         of despair exchange with hymns of thanksgiving and praise. . . . This
         living interchange between man and God is perhaps the deeper reason
         why the Book of Psalms has been cherished as the invaluable jewel in
         the Hebrew Bible by seekers after God in all ages.” Further, they are
         a “disclosure of God’s own heart. . . . They stand as inspired examples
2        of how God desires us all to respond by faith to the authentic revela-
         tions of Himself and of His deeds in the books of Moses.”—Hans K.

         Impressions, 1983), pp. 3, 4.

    Discussion Questions:
          l1 It is one thing to trust in the justice of God’s ultimate judg-

3
          ment at the end of time—we have to trust in that hope and prom-
          ise. At the same time, does this mean that we do not need to work
          for justice and judgment now because we know that it will ulti-
          mately come by God? How do we strike a right balance between
          seeking justice now and knowing that one day it will come?

          l2 Discuss more the question at the end of Wednesday’s lesson
          regarding worship and the forms of worship in church. How is
          it possible that things such as music, preaching, liturgy, and so
          forth could become ends in themselves as opposed to being the
          means of pointing us toward the Lord? So often, we can mistake
          the symbols for the reality behind the symbols. How can we pro-
          tect ourselves against this danger in our own worship services?

Following the Light
by Mohammed
   I live in an area of Nigeria where most people follow a religion other
than Christianity. I studied in a religious school where teachers taught
mostly the language and teachings of our religion. When I finished study-
ing in that school, I wanted to receive a more practical education in a
government primary school. My father reluctantly agreed. But when I
asked to continue studying in the secondary school, he refused, saying it
was too secular. So, I found work and secretly started saving money to
continue my studies on my own.
   One day as I was listening to the radio, I found an English-language
station called Adventist World Radio. I liked the programs and began
listening regularly. In time I realized that Jesus is more than a prophet; He
is the way of salvation. I called the radio station and asked how I could
learn more about Jesus. I wanted to become a Christian.
   The people at the station were cautious, but they sensed my sincerity
and gave me the name of a man I could study with. I had many questions,
and we studied for hours at a time. I realized that salvation doesn’t come
by works but is a gift of God through Jesus. I accepted Jesus’ sacrifice for
me and asked to be baptized.
   When I told my father that I had become a Christian, he was angry and
told me that if he ever saw me again, he would kill me. Sadly, I left my
father’s house and went to live with the man who had become my spiritual
father.
   I enrolled in secondary school. But when the teachers learned that I was
a Christian, they made life difficult for me. I had to transfer to a school in
the Christian part of the city.
   I want to finish school and return home to tell my family that Jesus isn’t
just a prophet. He is God, and He wants to be their Savior too. I know
that this is dangerous, but Jesus died for me. How can I do less? So many
in my country need to know the truth that I’ve found. And who better to
tell them than someone who has lived among them and knows how they
think? If I go as a Christian rather than as a convert from my former reli-
gion, I may be safe.
   I am grateful that my Christian brothers and sisters helped me find the
true faith through Adventist World Radio and a Christian education. I look
forward to serving as a Global Mission pioneer one day soon. Your mis-
sion offerings help support many evangelistic efforts to reach people who,
like me, are searching but have not yet found the light of life in Jesus.

Mohammed is preparing to serve God as a Global Mission pioneer in his homeland of
Nigeria.

          Lesson            8       *August 13–19


      Conformity, Compromise,
      and Crisis in Worship




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Gen. 6:5, Jer. 17:5, Deut.
      12:8, 13:18, 1 Kings 11:1–13, 1 Kings 18, Mal. 3:16–4:6.

Memory Text: “But solid food belongs to those who are of full
      age, that is, those who by reason of use have their senses exercised
      to discern both good and evil” (Hebrews 5:14, NKJV).



      I
          n 1954, novelist William Golding wrote The Lord of the Flies,
          a fictional account of a group of English children stranded on a
          deserted island after a plane crash. Golding used this story as a
      modern parable about the inherent evil in human beings. What made
      the narrative so powerful was that he used children, supposedly the
      essence of innocence, to make his point about just how corrupt, evil,
      egotistical, and violent humanity is at heart.
         Christians, of course, would say, So tell us something we don’t
      know. Human evil and sinfulness are part and parcel of the Christian
      message. The Bible is unambiguous on that point. But while the idea
      that evil is bad is quite uncontroversial, what is not so uncontroversial
      is the question, “What is evil?” Not everyone agrees on that.
         This week, as we continue to look at the question of worship, we
      are going to look at a certain kind of evil that has brought devastating
      consequences to God’s people and to humanity in general. We can
      view what this evil did to ancient Israel, but we need to ask the impor-
      tant question about just how susceptible we are to it ourselves.

*Study this week’s lesson to prepare for Sabbath, August 20.

     In Different Eyes
Read the following texts. What is the one point that they all have
     in common? Why is it so important for us to always keep this
     in mind? Gen. 6:5, Jer. 17:5, John 2:25, Rom. 3:9–12. What kind
     of things exist in your culture that could cause you to forget this
     fundamental truth?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        All through Scripture, we are warned: the human heart is deceit-
     ful; people are corrupt; do not look to others; no one is immune from
     evil. With the exception, of course, of Jesus, who never sinned, few
     characters whom the Bible pays much attention to are pictured as
     morally unscathed.
        One does not need Scripture, either, to see just how corrupt human-
     ity is. History, newspapers, the daily news, indeed, even our homes,
     and at times our own hearts should suffice to show us the morally
     decrepit state of humanity. What should be scary for us to remember
     is that if a perfect being, as Lucifer originally was, could choose evil,
     even in the perfect environment of heaven; if other perfect beings, as
     Adam and Eve were, could choose evil, even in the perfect environ-
     ment of Eden—then what about ourselves? We are born with corrupt
     and fallen natures, and we carry those natures with us in a fallen and
     corrupted environment. No wonder evil comes so easily, so naturally,
     to us. It is wired in our genes.
        We have to be careful, however, in our understanding of what
     evil is. Some things are so manifestly evil, so manifestly bad, that
     anyone—whether a believer in God or not—would deem them as
     evil. Evil, however, can be much more subtle. Things that the world
     or our culture and our society might view as fine, as normal, as just
     the way things are, could be precisely what the Bible condemns as
     wrong, sinful, even evil.

      Contrast Deuteronomy 12:8 with Deuteronomy 13:18. What
      crucial difference is being made here? Why is this difference so
      important for us to understand?
       What are some things your own society does not condemn
      that are clearly condemned by the Bible? More important,
      how much has society impacted you and the church in regard
      to these issues? That is, what things clearly condemned in
      Scripture might the church take too lightly, directly as a result
      of the influence of society? Bring your answer to class on
      Sabbath.
                                                                          65

     The Art (and Evil) of Compromise
        Politics, it has been said, is the art of compromise. The word art in
     this instance is very important, for compromise can be a very subtle,
     nuanced action on the part of the person doing it. A good politician
     is someone who can get the people to concede points, to compromise
     positions, and often not even realize that they are doing just that. In this
     context, then, there is no doubt that Satan is the best politician around.
        All through the Bible, we find examples of this evil—the evil of com-
     promise. Not that every compromise is evil, of course not. In a certain
     sense, life itself is a kind of compromise. Instead, compromise becomes
     another manifestation of human evil and corruption when those who
     should know better fall away from the truth that God has given them.
        For example . . .

Read 1 Kings 11:1–13. What happened here? How did this happen?
     What was it about Solomon that made his actions here so bad?
     How did this apostasy impact worship, faith, and the whole reli-
     gious system of Israel? Also, and most important, what lessons
     can we draw for ourselves today from this episode and the whole
     question of compromise?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Perhaps the most revealing phrase in this block of texts is the state-
     ment that it was “when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away
     his heart after other gods” (1 Kings 11:4). In other words, it did not
     happen overnight. The faithful, dedicated, and godly man revealed in
     the Bible did not suddenly, out of nowhere, turn away from the Lord.
     Instead, the change happened bit by bit, over time; a little compromise
     here, a little there, each step taking him further and further from where
     he should have been until he was doing something that the Solomon
     of his earlier years no doubt would have been horrified to see.
       Look, too, at what his compromises did to worship in Israel. They
     had a negative impact that would last for generations and beyond.

      Every now and then you hear stories about people who left the
      Seventh-day Adventist Church years ago, severed ties with it com-
      pletely, and then came back, only to be shocked by some of the
      changes that they saw in areas such as theology, standards, and
      worship. Though that might not be bad in every case, it might
      very well be bad in some. How can we know the difference?

     Counterfeit Worship
       In 1 Kings 11, Ahijah came to Jeroboam, Solomon’s servant, with a
     message that he would become king over ten of the tribes of Israel (vss.
     26–31). But the prophet made it clear to Jeroboam that his success would
     depend on his faithfulness to God’s commandments (vss. 37, 38).
       Unfortunately, Jeroboam listened only to what he wanted to hear
     and he forgot the conditions of success. He was all too ready to lead in
     the revolt (1 Kings 12:16–20), and almost immediately he took steps
     to prevent his subjects from returning to Jerusalem to worship.

Read 1 Kings 12:25–27. What does this tell us about the power and
     influence worship can have on the human mind?
     _______________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________

       Look at the account of Jeroboam’s setting up a counterfeit religion
     that would eventually separate Israel from the worship of the true
     God in Jerusalem (1 Kings 12:25–33). Notice how this new worship
     resembled the worship of the true God and at the same time contra-
     dicted most of the clear counsel of Yahweh:

       1. Offered sacrifices and ordained non-Levite priests (vss. 31–33).
       2. Made calves of gold to worship (vs. 28).
       3. Made Bethel a place of worship (vs. 29).
       4. Made Dan a place of worship (vs. 29).
       5. Instituted a rival feast to the Feast of Tabernacles (vs. 32).
       6. Built shrines on high places (vs. 31).

       Counterfeit money cannot deceive unless it looks like the real thing.
     In the same way, Jeroboam knew that his false worship must have many
     of the same elements of worship that the people were accustomed to,
     though he eventually declared, pointing to the golden calves, “ ‘Here are
     your gods, O Israel, which brought you up from the land of Egypt!’ ” (vs.
     28, NKJV).

      It is so easy from our perspective today to look back and won-
      der, How could they have fallen into such blatant apostasy? On
      the other hand, humans have an incredible capacity to deceive
      themselves (it is all part of our fallen and corrupted nature),
      and we deceive ourselves if we think we are not just as vulner-
      able as they were back then. Look at yourself, your lifestyle,
      your mode of worship. What might you be doing that is, in
      principle, not a whole lot different from what happened here?
      How willing are you to make changes, if need be?
                                                                          67

     Elijah and the Prophets of Baal
        Things went from bad to worse in the north, especially when it came to
     the question of worship under the reign of Ahab and Jezebel. It is against
     this background (see 1 Kings 17–19) that we come to the famous story of
     the confrontation between Elijah and the prophets of Baal. Here, we can
     see just how far compromise had taken them.

Read 1 Kings 18. Notice the difference in “worship styles” between
     Elijah and these false prophets. What lessons might we take away
     that could be relevant for ourselves today and the whole question
     of worship?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        It must have been quite a scene: these prophets of Baal wailing,
     leaping, crying (who knows what kind of music might have accom-
     panied their ritual), prophesying, even cutting themselves and spilling
     their own blood as part of their worship of Baal. These were certainly
     hyped-up people, full of zeal and passion for their faith and their god,
     a zeal and passion that testified to the sincerity of their beliefs.
        Today, too, some Christian worship services could remind one at
     times of something like this: a lot of emotion, a lot of hype, and a
     lot of noise. Though we want to avoid worship services that remind
     people of funerals, we also do not want worship services that remind
     them of priests of Baal at Mount Carmel either. Some seem to think
     the more sounds they make, the louder the music, the more emotional
     excitement generated, the better the worship service. Yet, that is not
     what worship is about.
        Perhaps one of the most important lessons from this account is
     that all worship must be focused on the true Lord, on the Creator.
     True worship needs to be grounded in the Word of God, pointing the
     worshiper to the Lord and His activity in history. In contrast to all the
     bedlam of the priests of Baal, Elijah prayed a simple prayer, “ ‘Hear
     me, O Lord, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the Lord
     God’ ” (vs. 37). This was no Elijah show. It was about worshiping the
     true God in contrast to any and all false ones, regardless of the form
     they take.
        Our worship services should always present worshipers with the
     question that Elijah asked Israel: “ ‘How long will you waver between
     two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, fol-
     low him’ ” (vs. 21, NIV). Our worship experience should force us to
     look inside our hearts and see where our true love and devotion are:
     on the Lord or on anything else.

     The Elijah Message
       “Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and
     the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth
     him not” (Mal. 3:18).

        For all the drama, Elijah’s confrontation with the 150 prophets on
     Mount Carmel boiled down to one question for the people gathered
     there with them: “ ‘How long will you waver between two opinions?
     If the Lord is God, follow him; but if Baal is God, follow him’ ”
     (1 Kings 18:21, NIV). However specific the context was, it really asks
     a question that each individual must answer for herself or himself:
     Do we worship and follow the true God or not? We might be able to
     “waver between two opinions” for only so long, but sooner or later we
     all come down on one side or another.
        At the end of time, when the great controversy is over, all humanity
     will have been forever divided into one of two classes: “between him
     that serveth God and him that serveth him not” (Mal. 3:18). As Jesus
     so bluntly and clearly said it: “ ‘He that is not with me is against me:
     and he that gathereth not with me scattereth’ ” (Luke 11:23). How
     much plainer could He be?

With the story of Elijah on Mount Carmel in the background, read
     Malachi 3:16–4:6. What is the Lord telling us here? How do we
     understand this “Elijah message” in the context of last-day events
     and the whole question of worship? See Rev. 14:7–12.

     _______________________________________________________

        Just as John the Baptist, whom Jesus referred to as “Elijah” (Matt.
     17:11–13), had a message of reformation, repentance, and obedience,
     Malachi makes it clear (Mal. 4:1, 5) that “Elijah” will again come just
     before the end of sin and evil. The book of Revelation proclaims to the
     last generation a message of warning, a call to obedience, and a call
     to worship the Creator God. As with Elijah on Carmel, people will in
     a very dramatic way have to make the most important choice of their
     lives, a choice that is filled with truly eternal consequences. The good
     news is that even before these final events unfold we can make daily
     choices that will greatly prepare us to be on the Lord’s side when the
     climactic battle between good and evil unfolds among the nations.

      Think about the daily choices you’ve made (perhaps in the
      past few days), even on the smallest of things (see Luke 16:10).
      Judging by those choices (and the compromises that might be
      manifest in those choices), which of the two sides are you choos-
      ing? Dwell on the implications of your answer.
                                                                         69

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “Jeroboam,” pp. 99–108; “Na-
         tional Apostasy,” pp. 114–116; “Elijah the Tishbite,” pp. 119–128;
         “The Voice of Stern Rebuke,” pp. 139–142; “Carmel,” pp. 143–
         154, in Prophets and Kings.

           “The apostasy prevailing today is similar to that which in the
         prophet’s day overspread Israel.”—Ellen G. White, Prophets and
         Kings, p. 170.
           “God has many thousands [in this age] who have not bowed the
1
         knee to Baal . . . [and] many who have been worshiping Baal igno-
         rantly, but with whom the Spirit of God is still striving.”—p. 171.
           A. W. Tozer, a well-known preacher of the twentieth century (he
         died in 1963), often preached against the worship of the “god of
         entertainment,” suggesting that no matter how hard they try, churches
         cannot compete with the world’s idea of entertainment. It is the cross
2
         of Jesus Christ, says Tozer, not entertainment, that will win souls to
         Christ. See A. W. Tozer, Tozer On Worship and Entertainment, com-
         piled by James L. Snyder (Camp Hill, Penn.: Wing Spread Publishers,
         1997), pp. 108, 109.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 In class, discuss your answer to Sunday’s question. How
          much has your society impacted the church’s views on the moral
3         issues of the day?

          l
          2 The descriptions of Baal worship hint that it was highly
          entertaining, which could help explain its popularity. How can
          we restore the sense of awe and reverence for God in our worship
          rather than encouraging expectations of being entertained?

          l
          3 How has the Seventh-day Adventist Church changed in the
          past twenty years? In your opinion, in what ways has it changed
          for the better, and in what ways not? If time should last, what
          do you think the Seventh-day Adventist Church will be like in
          twenty years? Try to imagine what your local church’s worship
          service will be like.

          l
          4 Think about how drastically the nation of Israel fell into
          apostasy. Again, none of this happened overnight. The devil, if
          nothing else, is patient. How can we protect ourselves individu-
          ally, and the church as a whole, from slowly but surely going the
          same way as Israel?

The Sermon That Changed
a Family
   Maria, ten, lives in Quito, Ecuador. When she was seven years old, her
mother started attending the Seventh-day Adventist Church and took Maria
and her brother with her. Maria loved church!
   In South America, Adventist children are encouraged to preach, and one
day a woman asked Maria to preach in church. Maria had seen other children
preach and agreed to try.
   Maria worked hard to memorize the short sermon the woman gave her. She
practiced it while standing in front of a mirror and then for her mother. On
Sabbath she was nervous, but she felt ready.
   Before church Maria and her mother asked God to use Maria’s words to
lead people to Jesus. Maria had no idea that God had something special in
store for her.
   Maria’s father, who wasn’t a Christian and didn’t go to church, sometimes
accused her mother of going to church to meet someone. On this Sabbath he
decided to check to be sure that his wife really was in church. He stepped into
the church just as Maria stood to preach.
   Maria was startled when she saw her father walk in. She prayed silently that
God would speak to him through her words. As she began to speak, she felt
God guiding her words.
   At the end of her sermon, Maria invited those who wanted to follow Jesus
to come to the altar. Thirty people came forward, including her father. With
tears in his eyes, he whispered to Maria, “Thank you so much. Please pray
that God will change my heart and my mind.”
   As Maria prayed for those who had come forward, she was praying espe-
cially for her father. After church, the family returned home together and had
a wonderful Sabbath.
   Maria saw changes in her father. He gave up smoking and drinking, and
sometimes he went to church with the family. But he loved soccer and didn’t
want to miss a chance to play in order to go to church. Then one day he hurt
his foot and couldn’t play. He told Maria, “I guess my sore foot is God’s way
of telling me to go to church.”
   Father began attending church every Sabbath. A few months later, he asked
to be baptized. Her mother hadn’t been baptized yet either, so Maria’s parents
were baptized together. The next week Maria and her brother were baptized.
   “I’m so glad that God used me to bring my family together to worship,” Maria
says. “We must all do whatever God asks us to share His love with others. You
never know who may come to Jesus because of something you say or do.”

      “Trust Not in Deceptive
      Words”: The Prophets and
      Worship

      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Mic. 6:1–8, Isa. 6:1–8,
      Isa. 1:11–15, Isa. 58:1–10, Isaiah 44, Jer. 7:1–10.

Memory Text: “ ‘Who then is like me? Let him proclaim it. Let
      him declare and lay out before me what has happened since I
      established my ancient people, and what is yet to come—yes, let
      him foretell what will come’ ” (Isaiah 44:7, NIV).



      R
              ussian author Ivan Turgenev, in his story Fathers and Sons,
              put these words in the mouth of a character: “The life of each
              of us hangs by a thread, an abyss may gape beneath us any
      minute, and yet we go out of our way to cook up all sorts of trouble for
      ourselves and to mess up our lives.”—Fathers and Sons (New York:
      Signet Classics, 2005), p. 131.
         Of course, the Lord offers a better way to live. He offers us the
      opportunity to follow Him, to love Him, to worship Him, and hence to
      spare ourselves many of the problems that we would otherwise bring
      upon ourselves.
         Yet, merely professing to follow the Lord is not what the Christian
      life is about. This week, we will look at what a few prophets said
      about those who thought that their “worship” of the true God, in the
      true temple on the true Sabbath day, was all that mattered, regard-
      less of how they lived the rest of the week. As the prophets show,
      this is a deception, a good way to “cook up all sorts of trouble for
      ourselves.”

     A Thousand Rams?
        Unlike every other religion, the religion of the Bible (both Testaments)
     teaches that salvation is by grace alone. Nothing we do can ever make
     us good enough to be accepted by God. Our good deeds, however well-
     intended, however Spirit-inspired, can never bridge the gap that sin has
     caused between God and humanity. If good works could save us, if
     good works could atone for sin, if good works could pay our debt before
     God, if good works could reunite fallen humanity with the Creator,
     then Jesus never would have had to die for us, and the plan of salvation
     would be something radically different from what it is.
        As it stands, only the death of Jesus credited to us by faith, only
     the righteousness of Christ, which He wrought out in His life, which
     is then given to all who truly accept it, can save the sinner. Sin is so
     bad, so contrary to the basic principles of God’s government, which
     is based on love and free choice, that nothing less than the death of
     Christ could solve the problem created by sin.
        All that being said, the Bible is clear that what we say, what we do,
     and what we think all matter, and these thoughts and actions reveal
     the reality of our experience with God.

With the above in mind, read Micah 6:1–8. What point is the prophet
     making here, especially in regard to the question of the sacrifices
     (part of the worship service in Israel), symbolic of the plan of
     salvation? How can these words be applied to us today? See also
     Deut. 10:12, 13.

       Those who claim to be children of God but who fail to show justice
     and mercy to their fellow men are acting out the spirit of Satan no
     matter how piously they may adhere to the forms of worship. On the
     other hand, those who walk humbly with their God will not neglect
     the principles of justice and mercy, nor will they scorn the proper
     forms of worship. God is looking for true worshipers who are willing
     to demonstrate their love for Him by obedient lives, motivated by
     humble hearts. What do all the right prayers, all the right styles of
     worship, and all the right theology mean if the person is nasty, unkind,
     arrogant, unjust, and unmerciful to others?

      What do you think is more important: correct theology or cor-
      rect actions? Can you have your theology right and yet treat
      others in a poor manner? What hope can you cling to if, per-
      haps, you see yourself revealed in the above texts?

     The Call of Isaiah
       While Hosea, Amos, and Micah were warning Israel of their immi-
     nent danger, Judah seemed to be prospering under the reign of several
     good kings. King Uzziah (also known as Azariah) was known and
     respected among the nations for his wise leadership and accomplish-
     ments (see 2 Chron. 26:1–15). But, as often happens, his success
     became his downfall. Humility was replaced by pride and devotion
     by presumption (see vss. 16–21).
       The people of Judah appeared to be prospering spiritually as well.
     The temple services were well-attended with a formality of religious
     fervor. Yet, many of the same evils that afflicted the people of Israel
     were fast corrupting the kingdom of Judah. It is at this time that the
     Lord calls Isaiah to His special work.

Read Isaiah 6:1–8. Why do you think Isaiah would respond as he did
     (vs. 5) upon seeing a vision of the Lord? What important theologi-
     cal truth is revealed here?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Try to imagine Isaiah’s overwhelming reaction to this heavenly
     revelation of the glory of God. Suddenly, he sees his own sins and the
     sins of his people stand out in bold relief against the spotless purity
     and the majestic holiness of Almighty God. No wonder he reacted as
     he did! It is hard to imagine anyone doing otherwise.
       Here we see played out before us a crucial and foundational truth
     regarding the state of humanity, especially in contrast to the holiness
     and glory of God. We see an attitude of repentance, of a willingness to
     acknowledge one’s own sinfulness, one’s own need of grace.
       Think for a moment what our worship services would be like were
     they to elicit in the worshipers a sense that they have been in the pres-
     ence of our Holy God, which in turn makes them deeply aware of their
     own sinfulness and need of His saving grace and cleansing power.
     Imagine if the singing, the liturgy, the prayer, and the preaching
     worked together in a way to lead us each time to faith, to repentance,
     to cleansing, and to a willingness to cry out, “Here I am; send me.”
     That is what worship should be about.

      Imagine yourself standing in the physical presence of Jesus.
      That is, if He were standing in the flesh right before you. What
      would your reaction be? What would you say? Or do? What
      about His promise to us in Matthew 28:20? What does that
      promise mean to us now, on a practical level?

     No More Vain Oblations
        It is easy to forget that so much of the writing of the Old Testament,
     especially the writings of the prophets, was written as admonitions
     and warnings to God’s covenant people, to the ones who were His
     “true church.” Most of these people professed to follow the true God,
     had a basic understanding of biblical truths (at least much more than
     their heathen neighbors), and knew the right things to say and do in
     worship. Yet, as becomes very clear to anyone reading the prophets,
     all this was nowhere near enough.

Read Isaiah 1:11–15. How are we to understand what the Lord, who
     instituted all these services, is saying to them?
     		         					
     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        The answer is found, really, in the few verses that follow (Isa.
     1:16–18), which in many ways is similar to what we saw in Sunday’s
     lesson on Micah. No question, the church is for sinners, and if we had
     to wait until we were perfect before we could worship the Lord, then
     none of us would worship Him.
        But that is not what the Bible is saying here or what it ever says. It
     is saying that God is more interested in how we treat others, especially
     the weak and helpless among us, than He is in all sorts of religious
     rituals, even the ones He instituted.

Read Isaiah 58:1–10. What is wrong with the fasting described here?
     How does God say that the people should fast? What point can we
     take from this for ourselves, whether or not we fast?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        Fasting is a form of self-denial of which Jesus had much to say. But
     some kinds of fasting are nothing but a vain show. It is a symptom of
     hypocrisy, which covets the privileges of obedience while detesting
     its responsibilities. Self-denial, motivated by love for God, ministers
     to those in need. This is the kind of fasting (self-denial) that honors
     Him; this is the kind of life that leads to the kind of worship that He
     does not despise, a worship that shows the sinner that, just as he or
     she has been the recipient of grace and undeserved love, so, too, he
     must dispense grace and undeserved love to others. That is the kind of
     self-denial that reveals true faith (Luke 9:23), the kind of self-denial at
     the heart of what it means to be a follower of Jesus.
                                                                            75

      Profitable for Nothing?
        South African writer Laurens van der Post once wrote about what he
      called “the burden of meaninglessness,” this sense some people have
      that, when it was all said and done, what, if anything, did their lives
      mean? Sooner or later, they will be dead, and anyone who knew them
      will be dead, and before long all memory of them will be forever gone
      too. In such a scenario, what do our lives mean, what can they mean?
      How easy it can be to get the sense that so much of what we do has no
      real meaning, no real lasting importance.

With these thoughts in mind, read Isaiah 44. Then, on the lines below,
      summarize the essence of those verses, particularly as they relate
      to the question of worship and what people worship.

        However much Isaiah was writing for his time and culture and peo-
      ple, look at how relevant the principles are for us today. The Lord, He
      alone is the Creator, He alone is our Redeemer, He alone can save us,
      thus He alone is worthy of our worship and our praise. Isaiah mocks
      those who create idols with their own hands, gods of their own mak-
      ing, and then bow down and worship them—things that are, indeed,
      “profitable for nothing.”
        And yet, as silly and as foolish as all that seems to us, are we not in
      danger of doing something similar, of dedicating ourselves, our lives,
      our time, and our energy into things that, in the end, are “profitable
      for nothing,” that cannot answer the deepest need of our souls now,
      and that surely cannot redeem us from the grave at the end of time?
      How crucial that we watch and pray, that, as Paul said, we examine
      ourselves to see whether we are in the faith (2 Cor. 13:5). Sabbath
      worship, if done right, can remind us in a special way about why we
      should worship only the Lord. Worship should be a time that espe-
      cially reminds us of what is important in life, what truly matters, and
      what is temporal, and even “profitable for nothing.”

       We all know the danger of making idols out of money, power,
       prestige, and so on. What about the danger of making idols out
       of things such as church, the pastor, our own ministries, or even
       our own faithfulness or lifestyle or piety? Think this through
76     and bring your answer to class on Sabbath.

     “This Is the Temple of the Lord, the
     Temple of the Lord. . . .”
       The southern kingdom of Judah had its spiritual ups and downs,
     times of reform and times of outright apostasy. Yet so often, even
     during the worst spiritual times, there was an outward show of piety
     and worship that was not acceptable to the Lord. How careful we need
     to be not to fall into the same deception ourselves.

Read Jeremiah 7:1–10. What theme do we see repeated here that
     we have seen all week? How can we take the principles here and
     apply them to ourselves in our context today?

        Look especially at verse 4. In one sense, the speakers were right.
     This was the “temple of the Lord,” the place where the Lord’s name
     was to dwell, the place where the sacrificial system—which God
     Himself had instituted—was performed, the place where the great
     truths of sacrifice, salvation, cleansing, and judgment were taught.
     After all, these were the covenant people. Their God was the true
     God, and they had more light and more truth, corporately, than their
     pagan neighbors around them had. None of this can be disputed, and
     yet, the Lord obviously was not pleased with them or their worship.
     In fact, He called out the words, “This is the temple of the Lord,
     the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord”—what? “Deceptive
     words?” They were deceptive, not because that was not the temple of
     the Lord but because the people believed that simply by coming to
     the temple of the Lord and worshiping there that they were safe, they
     were saved, they were doing all that was required.
        With all the light that we have been given, in what way might we
     as Seventh-day Adventists be in danger of making the same mistake
     these people made? Think through possible parallels between them
     and us and how, if we are not careful, we could fall into a similar
     deception. What possible “deceptive words” might we be in danger of
     trusting in, words that on the surface are true ( just as that was, indeed,
     “the temple of the Lord”) and yet could lead us into making the same
     kind of presumptuous errors?


                                                                            77

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Call of Isaiah,” pp. 303–
         310; “Hezekiah,” pp. 331–339; “Deliverance From Assyria,” pp. 349–
         366; “Manasseh and Josiah,” pp. 381–391; “Jeremiah,” pp. 407–421,
         in Prophets and Kings.

           “In Isaiah’s day the spiritual understanding of mankind was dark
         through misapprehension of God. . . .
           “In losing sight of the true character of Jehovah, the Israelites were
         without excuse. Often had God revealed Himself to them as one ‘full
         of compassion, and gracious, long-suffering, and plenteous in mercy
1
         and truth.’ Psalm 86:15.”—Ellen G. White, Prophets and Kings,
         pp. 311, 312.
           “In the vision that came to Isaiah in the temple court, he was given
         a clear view of the character of the God of Israel. ‘The high and lofty
         One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy,’ had appeared
         before him in great majesty; yet the prophet was made to understand
2
         the compassionate nature of his Lord. . . .”—p. 314.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 In class, go over your answer to Wednesday’s final question.
          What are some “good” things that we can make into idols? How
          do we know when something has become an idol?
          					
3         l2 Dwell more on the issues touched on in Thursday’s lesson.
          Look at the things that the people were doing, all the time com-
          ing to “the temple of the Lord” and worshiping there (see Jer.
          7:4), things that were so contrary to the revealed word of God.
          How can we learn to protect ourselves from falling into the same
          trap? Why does simple obedience to God’s revealed Word play
          such an important role in protecting us from all sorts of decep-
          tion?

          l
          3 Think about the worship services in your local church. Do
          you come away with a sense of the awe and majesty of God in
          contrast to your own sinfulness and need of grace? If not, what
          could be changed in order to help the church as a whole have,
          to some degree, the experience that Isaiah had? (See Monday’s
          lesson.) Why is that so important?

          l
          4 How many things do you do in your life that are “profitable
          for nothing”? How much time do you spend basically “wasting
          time,” doing things that, in and of themselves, are useless, vain,
          and basically “profitable for nothing”? How can you learn to
          make better use of the limited time we all have here in this life?

Cult to Convict to Christian
by Hensley Dyer
     I was lost, physically and spiritually lost. For years I searched for a
  spiritual anchor. I knew who Jesus was, but I didn’t know Him personally.
  I joined a cult and eventually became possessed by demonic forces from
  whom I couldn’t break free.
     I sensed the Holy Spirit telling me to leave the religion I was in, so I did.
  But leaving the drugs and alcohol was harder. And the demons wouldn’t
  leave me. I tried to sort out my spiritual life, and the Holy Spirit convicted
  me of my need to surrender to Jesus. But my life was still a mess.
     Then my wife told me to leave. I had no money, no home, no car. I
  prayed, “God, if You carry me through this, I’ll serve You the rest of
  my life.” God opened my eyes to my spiritual condition, and He walked
  through the fire with me. I prayed for forgiveness and forgave everyone
  who had ever hurt me. Then one day I was arrested and sentenced to prison
  for crimes I had committed years earlier. It was the best thing that ever
  happened to me.
     I prayed and read the Bible more. God showed me the Ten Command-
  ments. I realized I had been breaking several of them. I knew nothing
  about the Sabbath, but I wanted to obey. I started looking for an Adventist
  pastor.
     Churches hold meetings on Thursdays, but I didn’t want to go. But a
  fellow prisoner invited me, so I went. I sat down next to a woman who
  said she was an Adventist. I was so excited! I asked for Bible lessons, and
  I began spending the Sabbath studying the Bible and the Bible lessons. I
  discovered so many things I didn’t know before. God impressed me to
  share what I was learning with others.
     Then one day, unexpectedly, I was released. I was out of prison with
  a place to stay and my prison ministry friends to help me. I went to the
  Adventist Church and met the pastor. He offered to pick me up on Sabbath
                             morning. When I told him I was an ex-prisoner,
                             he said, “It doesn’t matter. God loves you, and
                             His people will love you too.” And they did.
                                God has delivered me from my past and my
                             sins. I’m His child now.
                                God used many people to lead me to Jesus, and
                             I praise Him for their help. Your mission offer-
                             ings help sponsor outreach such as the prison
                             ministries program that helped build my founda-
                             tion of faith. I thank you.

Memory Text: “Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat,

          t is very hard from our perspective today—removed as we are by
          more than one thousand nine hundred years from the final destruc-
          tion of the Jerusalem temple—to understand just how significant
      the temple was in the Jewish nation’s national and religious life.
      It was the apex of worship, the center of their ethnic and religious
      identity. It was where the Lord said He would dwell and rule in the
      midst of Israel. It was where the follower of YHWH found cleansing,
      forgiveness, grace, and reconciliation.
         Because it was, truly, the Lord’s house, many people disbelieved
      the prophetic warnings that it would be destroyed by Babylon. How
      could the Lord allow His sacred temple to be obliterated? We only
      can guess at the shock when, indeed, as the prophets warned, the
      Babylonians razed it. And yet, even amid all the devastation, the Lord
      promised that the nation would be restored, the temple rebuilt, and
      Israel given another chance to fulfill her prophetic destiny.
         This week we will look at some of the issues regarding worship dur-
      ing the time of the exile and, then, the promised restoration.

      “Son of Man, Have You Seen . . .?”
        Apostasy does not happen overnight; whole peoples do not fall away
      in a day, a week, even in a year. The process is much slower; a little
      change here, a little compromise there; a little less rigidity in order to
      keep up with the times, or to be relevant, or to fit better with the trends
      of society and culture. Bit by bit, step by step, and before long, a whole
      nation is doing things that, perhaps a generation or two ago, would have
      been looked upon in horror. Such was the fate of ancient Israel and
      Judah; such was the fate of early Christianity. Such can be the fate of
      any church, including ours, that does not carefully and jealously guard
      the sacred truths and practices given it by the Lord.

Read Ezekiel 8. As you read, realize all this was taking place in the
      sacred temple that the Lord had instituted, the very place where
      the Lord had promised to place His name. How could the people,
      the spiritual leaders, have fallen into such apostasy? What lessons
      can we learn from this for ourselves?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        The secret sins, indulged by priests and elders, were the abominable
      and repulsive worship practices of their culture. Those who should
      have been leading God’s people in true worship were adapting that
      worship to the sinful and corrupt customs of their time and environ-
      ment, thus bringing the abominations of the surrounding culture
      into God’s holy sanctuary. How ironic that only the coming of the
      Babylonian army would bring an end to the desecration of God’s
      temple, and then only by destroying it.

Carefully read Ezekiel 8:12. What kind of logic and rationale were
      these elders using to justify their actions? What might have led
      them to such false conclusions?

      _______________________________________________________

         These people must have turned so far away from the Lord that they
      believed He did not see them or that He did not care about their prac-
      tices. The Lord, who again and again showed His care, His nearness,
      and His desire for obedience, now was deemed to have forsaken the
      land? How careful we need to be, because sin will harden our hearts
      and poison our minds until we rationalize even the most horrific
      practices.

                                                                             81

     Worshiping the Image
        As we have touched on all through this quarter, the final test in
     the last days deals with the question of worship (Rev. 14:1–12). All
     humanity will be split into two camps: those who worship the Creator,
     the One who made the heavens and the earth, and those who worship
     the beast and his image. Even though this sequence in the prophetic
     picture has yet to unfold, one could argue that, even now, all the world
     is divided into two camps: those who are faithful to the Lord and those
     who are not. There is no middle ground either: we are on one side or
     the other.
        With this in mind, the story of the three Hebrew boys in the book
     of Daniel becomes quite relevant. It is not just a dramatic story of a
     supernatural rescue of those faithful followers of YHWH. It becomes,
     instead, a symbol, a type, for the test of worship that will come upon
     the world just before the second coming of Christ.

Read Daniel 3. Compare the worship of the image there with the
     worship of the image in Revelation 14. What can we learn from
     this story that can help us understand the issue regarding the
     mark of the beast?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       The second commandment, the one forbidding idolatry (Exod. 20:4–6),
     was at issue here; the fourth commandment (Exod. 20:8–11), the Sabbath
     commandment, will be the outward issue in the last days. How interesting
     that these both are commandments that were changed and tampered with
     by the beast power itself (see Dan. 7:25). Both commandments are tied
     in directly with worship; the second forbids the worship of idols, while
     the fourth shows why one should not worship idols, and that is because
     the Lord of nature, not nature itself, is the One who created and redeemed
     them (see also Deut. 5:12–15).
       In both cases, too, there is an earthly political/religious entity that wants
     the worship and fealty owed only to the Lord, and in both cases this
     power is willing to resort to violence in order to get that “worship.”

      Think through what it means to worship something. Is it always
      wrong to worship anything other than the Lord? If not, why
      not? Might there be some things that we can worship without
      sinning, without violating God’s law? If so, what? If not, how
      can we make sure we are not worshiping anything other than
82    our Lord?

      “Consider Your Ways”
Read Jeremiah 29:10–14. What does this tell us about the character of
      God? What hope can we, in our own context, take from these texts?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        After seventy years, as foretold, the Lord began the restoration of
      the exiles back to the Promised Land. Israel was to be given another
      chance to fulfill her prophetic destiny.
        Central to that role was, of course, the temple, the sanctuary,
      the place where the entire plan of salvation was taught through the
      types and symbols of the service. Here the work and mission of the
      Messiah, through which the whole world could have salvation, was
      prefigured (see John 3:16; 2 Cor. 5:19; Heb. 8:1, 2).
        Yet, the work of rebuilding the temple did not go as smoothly or as
      quickly as it should have. Forces, internal and external, got in the way,
      and the work was delayed. This was not as the Lord would have it, and
      He spoke through Haggai to let the people know His displeasure.

Read Haggai 1. What happened here? What diverted their atten-
      tion? Why is that so easy to do?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        How easy it is to let worldly toils, worldly desires, even worldly
      needs get in the way of our spiritual responsibilities. The Lord let
      them know that they would never have true satisfaction apart from
      their devotion to Him and the work He had given them to do. All
      too often we can, in our own way, make the same mistake, getting
      so caught up in the ways of the world that we neglect what should
      be first and foremost in our lives: our relationship with God. Maybe
      the Lord is saying to us, either corporately or individually, “Consider
      your ways.”

       Consider your ways. What do your ways, your actions, the
       things you do, and don’t do—what do they say about your rela-
       tionship to the Lord? In what ways might you be guilty of the
       same things as the people depicted here in Haggai?

     Your Fathers, Where Are They?
       The rebuilding of the temple took approximately twelve years.
     Ezra 5:1, 2 refers to Zechariah as one of the “prophets of God helping
     them.” His emphasis, like Haggai’s, was upon the glory that would
     one day inhabit the temple.
       Yet, as often is with prophecy, the promises are not unconditional.
     Humans, given free will, must make the choice to obey the Lord, to
     do what He commands, not as a means of salvation but as a means of
     showing the fruit and the benefits of salvation.
       Human freedom is an unspoken assumption all through the
     Scriptures. People have the option to choose whom they will serve
     and worship, and the fulfillment of the promises is incumbent upon
     the choices that people make. The Bible is filled with wonderful
     promises to any and all who faithfully seek and serve Him.

Read Zechariah 1:1–6. What theme is found here that is repeated,
     again and again, through pretty much all of the Bible? How is the
     reality of human free will and free choice revealed in these texts?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Some of the most poignant words in that text are found in verse 5.
     “Your fathers, where are they?” In other words, learn from the mis-
     takes of those who came before you; do not do what they did; learn
     from the past, learn from what happened before you.
       Here is where the ministry of the pastor in the pulpit can come in.
     Here is where the pastor can, in the role of the prophets, point the
     people to the Lord’s leading, to His promises, and to the conditions of
     those promises. The preaching of the Word should not cause theologi-
     cal confusion or controversy: it should be Christ centered, pointing to
     what the Lord has done for us, what He offers to do for us, and what
     He will do for us, all on the condition that we come to Him in faith
     and repentance. That is essentially what Zechariah is saying to the
     people here: repent, turn from your evil ways, learn from the past, and
     put your hope in the Lord and the promises of the Lord for the future.
     In the same way, today, with the revelation of what the sanctuary
     service was all about (the life and death and high priestly ministry of
     Jesus), we should come to the Lord and worship Him in an attitude
     of faith, repentance, and obedience. Again, though obedience cannot
     save us (it is way too late for that), there is no such thing as salvation
     without it, regardless of how flawed our obedience tends to be.

     Nehemiah’s Prayer
       Despite all the promises of restoration, things were not going well
     in Jerusalem. The people faced obstacle after obstacle, many of them
     as a result of their own disobedience. The prophet Nehemiah, while
     serving the Persian king, received word about the situation there and
     responded with fasting, mourning, and prayer. His passion and con-
     cern for the situation clearly are revealed in the first chapter of the
     book that bears his name.

Read Nehemiah 1, his prayer in response to what he heard, and then
     answer the following questions:

       1. Why would Nehemiah, who as far as we know was faithful,
     include himself among those who had sinned against the Lord? See
     Dan. 9:5, 6.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 Read the prayers of intercession for the Seventh-day Adventist
          Church that were written in response to Thursday’s lesson.
          What can we learn from each of these prayers? What do people
          perceive as the greatest need of the church at the present time?

          l
          2 What lessons can we learn from our own church fathers (and
          mothers)? That is, what important spiritual lessons can our own
          Seventh-day Adventist history teach us?

          l3 What are ways in which we, as a church, in our efforts to
          reach out to the surrounding culture, are in danger of compro-
          mising crucial truths? Why are we so often blind to it when it
          happens?

          l
          4 While there is always the danger of compromising ourselves
          in an attempt to be relevant, there is also the danger of locking
          ourselves in beliefs or practices that, perhaps, need refining or
          changing. How can we know what is immutable and unchange-
          able, in contrast to that which can and should change with the
          times?

A Kindness Pays				
   Julie is a lay evangelist. She and her team partner were sharing God’s
love in a village near Chennai, India. But no one seemed interested. So
they knocked on the door of a house a short distance away. A woman
answered and welcomed Julie and her partner inside. They learned that the
woman’s name was Sujatha, and she and her husband were Christians. But
no other Christians lived nearby.
   Julie and her partner visited Sujatha’s home every day to study the
Bible. Sujatha invited other family members, all women, but her husband,
Erwin, never attended. Julie learned that Erwin was shy and uncomfort-
able around strangers. He left the house whenever someone came to visit.
Sujatha told Julie that after they left, Erwin would ask what they had
talked about. He asked her to ask for prayer for their family. Julie prayed
for a way to engage Erwin in the studies.
   Julie and her partner had to attend three days of meetings elsewhere and
couldn’t visit the family, but they left their cell phone number in case the
family wanted to contact them. One afternoon they answered a call and
were surprised to learn it was Sujatha’s husband. “My wife is seriously
ill,” he told Julie. “Please pray for her.”
   Julie and her partner prayed for Sujatha. As soon as their meetings
ended, they hurried back to visit the family. They found Sujatha seriously
ill with a high fever. “We gave Erwin what little money we had and told
him to take Sujatha to the hospital. There, doctors discovered that she
had typhoid.” Julie and her partner stayed at the house and cleaned it
thoroughly.
   After Sujatha returned home, Erwin stayed and talked with Julie and her
partner during their Bible studies. Julie learned that the family had con-
sidered ending their lives because they were so poor. But a Christian had
offered them a job and a place to live. In time they had joined a Protestant
church. They were still poor, but they had hope.
   As Sujatha’s strength grew, she shared her new faith with a neighbor.
Within a few weeks she was bringing her neighbor to the church. Sujatha
has been baptized, and Erwin is preparing for baptism. Sujatha is study-
ing with five other families in her neighborhood, and Julie is helping her
introduce them to Christ.
   A kindness sown in one couple is reaping seeds in six other families.
Our mission offerings help support lay evangelists and Global Mission
pioneers such as Julie around the world. Thank you for helping to tell the
world that Jesus loves them.

      In Spirit and in Truth




      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Luke 1:46–55, 4:5–8, Deut.
      11:16, John 4:1–24, Luke 19:37–40.

Memory Text: “But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true
      worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for
      the Father seeketh such to worship him” (John 4:23).



      A
              s we have seen all quarter, the first angel’s message is a call to
              proclaim the “everlasting gospel.” At the center of that gospel
              is Jesus, the incarnate God, the God who through forces and
      means that our minds cannot even begin to grasp came into this world
      as a human being.
         Think through what this means: the God who created all that was
      created (John 1:1–3) became a human, and in that humanity lived
      a sinless life and then offered Himself as a sacrifice for the sins of
      all humanity. When you think about the size of the cosmos, the bil-
      lions of galaxies, each composed of billions of stars, and to believe
      that the One who created all this was Jesus, it defies the human
      mind; it is something so incredible we barely can comprehend it.
      No wonder Paul wrote: “For the preaching of the cross is to them
      that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power
      of God” (1 Cor. 1:18).
         With a truth like this before us, it is no wonder we want to worship
      such a God. This week we will explore themes of worship and praise
      as revealed in the ministry of the incarnate Christ, the Creator who
      took upon Himself the form and the flesh of the created.

     Mary’s Song of Praise and Worship
        Though Mary, the mother of Jesus, has been the subject of an
     intense amount of religious interest through the centuries, most of that
     interest is tradition derived from a host of sources that are not rooted
     in Scripture.
        Nevertheless, in the question of Christ’s coming to earth, Mary
     played a crucial and pivotal role: in her womb the Savior of the
     world was miraculously conceived; in her womb He grew into the
     infant Jesus. Looking back with all the hindsight and light given us
     in the New Testament, we only can marvel at the miracle. Though no
     doubt knowing that she was part of an incredible event that was to
     have important consequences for her people, the young Mary most
     likely had no real idea of what she was going to be part of. She knew
     enough, though, that she could marvel at the amazing circumstances
     that had so radically changed her life.

Read Luke 1:46–55, often known as the Song of Mary. What is the
     background to this song? Why is she singing it? What elements
     of praise and worship are revealed here? What appears here that
     we have touched on all through the quarter? 		

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       This song of praise and worship is filled with allusions and images
     taken from the Old Testament, the only Scripture that she would have
     known. Here we can see her giving glory to the Lord and acknowledg-
     ing His leading not only in her own life but among her own people, as
     well. Her allusion to Abraham is, clearly, a reference to the covenant
     the Lord made with His people; she is praising God for His promises
     to them and sees those promises as her hope and her people’s hope
     for the future.
       Again, however much she did not know, she knew enough to see
     the working of the Lord. For that, she was thankful and worshipful.
       		
      How much of the miraculous do you see in your own life?
      Might it be there and yet you are just too hard, too closed, too
      wrapped up in yourself to see it as you should?

     Worship and Serve
       “And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed
     unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. And
     the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the
     glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I
     will I give it. If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.
     And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me,
     Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and
     him only shalt thou serve” (Luke 4:5–8).

        Imagine Jesus, after 40 full days of hunger, weariness, self-denial,
     and privation, now facing the open and blatant temptations of the devil.
     It is not hard to imagine just how beautiful all “the kingdoms of the
     world” in their “power” and their “glory” must have appeared to Jesus
     in this temptation. Satan has been a master at making the things of this
     world always look so charming, so pleasant, so fulfilling, which is why
     people so readily fall for the deception this world presents.

Read the above verses carefully, especially Jesus’ response. What
     does Jesus mean by linking together the verbs “worship” and
     “serve”? How are they related?
     _______________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________

        All through the Old Testament, the concept of worshiping false
     gods and serving them is linked. “And lest thou lift up thine eyes
     unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the
     stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship
     them, and serve them, which the Lord thy God hath divided unto all
     nations under the whole heaven” (Deut. 4:19; see also Deut. 11:16,
     Ps. 97:7, Dan. 3:12). Basically, you serve what you worship; hence,
     how important it is that you worship only the Lord.
        Thus, we see a crucial point about worship. It is hard to imagine
     someone who worships the Lord in faith, in surrender, in humility
     and love and fear, at the same time serving other gods, whatever form
     they may come in. Worship, then, can be a protection for us against
     idolatry. The more we worship the Lord, even in our private devotion,
     the better protected we are against serving self, sin, and all the other
     forces vying for our service.

      Think about this idea more: what we worship is what we serve.
      How have you seen that principle manifested in your own life?
      How can your worship experience help you stay focused on
      serving only the Lord?

     Worshiping What You Know Not
        As we have seen numerous times, even with all the intricate and deep
     forms of worship that the Lord had instituted for Israel, it was not the
     forms alone that the Lord cared about. The forms and traditions and
     liturgy were all means to an end, and that end was a person surrendered
     in body and mind to his or her Creator and Redeemer. It is much easier,
     however, to make one’s religion a series of formulas, traditions, and
     outward acts than it is to daily die to self and surrender in humility and
     faith to the Lord. This fact surely goes a long way in explaining why the
     Bible spends a lot of time dealing with those whose hearts aren’t right
     with God, regardless of how “correct” their forms of worship are.
        This, too, was a problem that Jesus dealt with when here in the
     flesh.

Read John 4:1–24. What important point about worship was Jesus
     making to the Samaritan woman in verse 21? Why was He point-
     ing her away from specific places of worship?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        In pointing out some of her deepest secrets, Jesus got the woman’s
     attention. He then used that moment to point her to something better
     than what she had. Jesus uses the powerful phrase “Woman, believe
     me” in order to show her that true worship went far beyond the
     outward forms and places of worship. “This mountain” was Mount
     Gerizim, where the Samaritans had built a temple. Of course, that
     would be what one would expect a Jew to say to a Samaritan.
        But Jesus did not stop there. He included even Jerusalem, the site
     of the sacred temple that He, Himself, had picked. Thus, early on in
     His earthly ministry, Jesus was, in a very broad way, pointing to what
     He later came right out and said in reference to the temple, “There
     shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown
     down” (Matt. 24:2). In all this, Jesus was working to give the woman
     the “living water” (John 4:10), which is Himself. He wanted her to
     see that a personal relationship with her Creator and Redeemer was
     the foundation of worship, and certainly not the forms and traditions
     of her faith, which had deviated from the true religion of the Jews.
     His reference to Jerusalem (John 4:21), however, proved that He was
     pointing to something even beyond the system of sacrifice and wor-
     ship that He Himself had created.

      In what ways can all the aspects of your worship experience
      help you deepen your relationship with God?

      The True Worshipers
        “But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers
      shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father
      seeketh such to worship him” (John 4:23).

         After pointing the Samaritan away from specific places of worship
      and then telling her of the superiority of the Jewish faith over hers,
      Jesus then tells the woman about “the true worshipers.” In verse 21,
      Jesus said that the hour “is coming” when people will not worship
      either in that mountain or in Jerusalem; in verse 23, however, He says
      that the hour “now is” that all true worshipers will worship in spirit
      and in truth. In other words, do not look to some past glory, and do
      not look to some future event. Rather, the time “now is” to give the
      Lord the worship He deserves, and through that worship, experience
      the love, the grace, and the salvation that He offers.

Jesus said that all true worshipers will “worship the Father in spirit
      and in truth.” What do these two elements represent, and how are we
      to apply this to our worship experience today? See also Mark 7:6–9.

         Jesus here is calling for a balanced form of worship: a worship that
      comes from the heart, that is sincere and deeply felt, that comes from
      the love and the fear of God. There is nothing wrong with emotions in
      worship; after all, our religion calls upon us to love God (1 John 5:2,
      Mark 12:30), and how can that be separated from emotions?
         At the same time, God calls upon His true worshipers to worship
      Him “in truth.” God has revealed His will, His truth, His law—truth
      that we are expected to believe and obey. True worshipers will love
      God, and from that love seek to serve Him, obey Him, and do what is
      right. Yet, how can they know what is right without knowing the truth
      about faith, obedience, salvation, and so forth? The idea that beliefs
      do not matter, that only a sincere spirit matters, is misguided. It is only
      half of the equation. Correct beliefs do not save, but they will give us
      a greater understanding of the character of God, and that should make
      us love and serve Him all the more.

       Is your worship more spirit than truth, or more truth than
       spirit? How can you learn to incorporate and balance both
       these aspects of worship?

      Worshiping at His Feet
         Throughout the long years of Christian history, the church has been
      divided over the issue of Christ’s divinity. Was He truly the eternal
      God, One with the Father since eternity? Or was He created later,
      a being who came into existence through the creative power of the
      Father?
         Though early on in our own church, some confusion on this matter
      existed, Ellen G. White made it very clear years ago what her position
      was—a position that, as a church, we have fully accepted today:
         “ ‘His name shall be called Immanuel, . . . God with us.’ ‘The light of
      the knowledge of the glory of God’ is seen ‘in the face of Jesus Christ.’
      From the days of eternity the Lord Jesus Christ was one with the Father;
      He was ‘the image of God,’ the image of His greatness and majesty,
      ‘the outshining of His glory.’ It was to manifest this glory that He came
      to our world. To this sin-darkened earth He came to reveal the light of
      God’s love,—to be ‘God with us.’ Therefore it was prophesied of Him,
      ‘His name shall be called Immanuel.’ ”—The Desire of Ages, p. 19.

Read the following texts. What do they tell us about the deity of Christ?
      Matt. 2:11, 4:10, 9:18, 20:20, Mark 7:7, Luke 24:52, John 9:38.

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        Jesus was very clear in His response to Satan (Matt. 4:10) that
      the Lord alone should be worshiped, which leads to the important
      point shown in the texts above: Christ never refused their worship.
      No example is given in the numerous times when people worshiped
      Him where He told them, Don’t worship Me, point your worship only
      toward the Father. In fact, the opposite is the case.

Read Luke 19:37–40. What does Jesus’ response to the Pharisees say
      about His attitude toward those who worshiped Him?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         The point here is to reiterate a theme seen all this quarter, which
      is how crucial it is that Jesus be the center and focus of all our wor-
      ship. Every song, every prayer, every sermon, everything that we do
      should, in one way or another, ultimately direct our minds toward
      Christ, the incarnate God who offered Himself as the sacrifice for our
      sins. Worship that leaves us with a sense of awe, love, and reverence
      for our Lord is worship that is no doubt pleasing in His sight.
                                                                            93

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “God With Us,” pp. 19–26,
         in The Desire of Ages.

           “Not by seeking a holy mountain or a sacred temple are men brought
         into communion with heaven. Religion is not to be confined to exter-
         nal forms and ceremonies. The religion that comes from God is the
         only religion that will lead to God. In order to serve Him aright, we
         must be born of the divine Spirit. This will purify the heart and renew
1
         the mind, giving us a new capacity for knowing and loving God. It
         will give us a willing obedience to all His requirements. This is true
         worship. It is the fruit of the working of the Holy Spirit.”—Ellen G.
         White, The Desire of Ages, p. 189; emphasis supplied.
           “One equal with God, acted as servant to His disciples. . . . He to
         whom every knee shall bow, He whom the angels of glory count it
2
         honor to serve, bowed down to wash the feet of those who called Him
         Lord.”—p. 649.

    Discussion Questions:
          l
          1 The religious leaders of Christ’s day claimed to know the
          Scriptures but were oblivious to the greatest miracle in history,
          the birth of the Messiah. Meanwhile, the wise men of the East
3         came looking for Him in the right place at the right time. What
          significance does this story hold for us today as Christians, and
          as a church? How can we avoid the mistakes of the people in
          Christ’s day, as we see the prophecies of the last days being
          fulfilled?

          l
          2 Talk about the deity of Christ, why that is so important to
          our faith and worship. What do we lose if we, in any way, make
          Christ anything other than fully God?

          l
          3 Think again about Mary and what must have been going
          through her mind at this incredible turn of events. Think how
          much she didn’t understand and how hard some of this might
          have been for her (being pregnant without ever knowing a man
          certainly must have been stressful). And yet, even amid all this,
          she was able to praise the Lord and worship Him, despite so
          many unanswered questions, so many troublesome thoughts, so
          many unknowns. How can we learn to do the same: to worship
          and praise the Lord amid times of uncertainty and unknowns?
          In fact, why might that be of all times the best time to be whole-
          heartedly in an attitude of worship?

The Priest Who Helped the
Adventists
   Ernesto is a farmer and a community leader in central Philippines. He was
a devoted member of his church. As he read the Bible, Ernesto discovered
some things that didn’t seem right. He learned that our bodies are the temple
of God, yet his own priest smoked. Ernesto asked the priest about this, and the
priest only responded, “Leave me alone.” Dissatisfied, Ernesto went home.
   A few days later, some Seventh-day Adventists asked Ernesto for permis-
sion to hold evangelistic meetings in the area. Ernesto agreed. The Adventists
didn’t have a sound system, so Ernesto offered his personal sound system.
The Adventists thanked Ernesto and asked him to operate the sound system
to be sure that it was properly cared for. Ernesto agreed. Ernesto attended the
meetings and operated the sound system for the Adventists. He also invited
others to attend the meetings as well.
   The Adventist leader asked Ernesto to let his teenage children read the
Bible texts at the meetings. Again Ernesto agreed, though some warned him it
could be trouble. When the meetings ended, 25 people were baptized, includ-
ing Ernesto, his wife, and two of their children. Ernesto learned to give Bible
studies, and a year later he held another evangelistic series after which 14
people were baptized, including three more of his children.
   The priest gave Bibles to his parishioners and told them to read the Bible
so they would be prepared if Ernesto tried to beguile them away from their
church. As some members read their new Bible, they noticed things. One
woman asked, “The Bible says we shouldn’t worship idols. Then why do we
bow to statues?”
   The priest answered, “You’re right. The Bible forbids it. Adventists cannot
be faulted for refusing to worship idols.” Another asked why they eat pork
when the Bible forbids it. The priest said, “We cannot fault those who refuse
to eat pork.”
   A third member asked him, “We worship on Sunday, but I can’t find
Sunday mentioned in the whole Bible. Are the Adventists right to worship
on Saturday?” The priest answered, “The Adventists are right to worship on
Saturday, but our tradition is to worship on Sunday.”
   As a result of the priest’s responses, several families studied the Bible with
Ernesto, and eventually they were baptized into the Adventist Church.
   Thanks to the priest’s distribution of Bibles and his answers to his mem-
bers’ questions, more than fifty members of Ernesto’s former church have
become Seventh-day Adventists. Ernesto is teaching them how to give
Bible studies so they can help their church grow.

      Worship in the Early
      Church


      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Acts 1:1–11, 2:14–41,
       17:15–34, 18:1–16, 1 Corinthians 13.

Memory Text: “If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but
      have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal”
      (1 Corinthians 13:1, NIV).



      S
             oon after Christ returned to heaven, the early church began to
             expand and grow. At first, it almost was exclusively Jews who
             were accepting Jesus as the Messiah and coming into the ranks
      of believers. Indeed, at first, many of the believers thought that the
      gospel was only for the Jews, which showed how much they still had
      to learn.
         At Pentecost, after Peter’s preaching and altar call before a multi-
      tude of Jews (Acts 2), “Then they that gladly received his word were
      baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three
      thousand souls” (Acts 2:41). This text alone shows the fallacy of the
      idea that all the Jews rejected Jesus.
         Yet, we would be mistaken to look back on the early church as
      some sort of idyllic time of worship and praise. Though in a radically
      different context, the early church struggled with some of the same
      issues we struggle with today, issues that could and would impact
      everything about their faith, including worship.
         This week we will take a look at a few instances from the early days
      of Christianity and some of the challenges the church faced as it grew,
      and we’ll seek to learn from the good things and, also, from the bad.

     Many “Proofs”
        From a human perspective, Jesus’ earthly ministry did not look so
     successful. Though He had attracted a fairly popular following while
     alive, it did not catch on en masse. Many leaders rejected Him, and
     of course, the Romans crucified Him, causing His closest disciples to
     scatter and flee.
        Things looked pretty bad until His resurrection and then Pentecost,
     when suddenly His followers found a new boldness to proclaim their
     crucified Master as the Messiah of Israel. It was only after the resur-
     rection of Jesus, in fact, that the early church started to take off.

Read Acts 1:1–11. What important truths do we find here about the
     Second Coming, baptism, the Holy Spirit, and mission?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

Look especially at verses 3 and 6. What do they tell us about how
     much more truth the disciples had to learn?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        One of the most interesting parts of this section is verse 3, in which
     Luke states that Jesus presented them with many “proofs.” Some ver-
     sions use the phrase “infallible proofs,” which is somewhat overstat-
     ing the case. Another translation calls it “convincing proofs,” which is
     the less problematic translation. The point here is that the believers in
     Jesus were given powerful evidence, “proof” of Jesus as the Messiah.
     Considering the daunting task that He had called them to and all the
     opposition that they would face, they needed all the proof they could
     get. The good news is that the Lord will give us all the reasons we
     need for faith, all the reasons we need to believe in things that we
     do not fully understand. As we see in these texts, the disciples still
     did not fully understand the Lord’s intentions regarding the nation of
     Israel, even after all this time with Jesus. We need to learn to worship,
     praise, and obey the Lord, despite all that we do not understand.

      Think about the powerful evidence we have for our beliefs, on
      all the good reasons for the logic of our faith. Notice, too, the
      use of the word faith. What does faith imply? That is, what good
      reasons do you have for having faith, a belief in something that
      you do not fully understand?
                                                                          97

     The Preaching of the Word
       A great part of the Protestant worship tradition has been the preach-
     ing of the Word. A sacred responsibility falls upon the one given the
     task to feed the sheep, to teach and to preach and to exhort and to
     encourage. Music, liturgy, prayer, the Lord’s Supper, and foot wash-
     ing all have their place, but, perhaps, nothing’s more important than
     what is preached from the pulpit during the worship hour.

Read Peter’s sermon on the Day of Pentecost (Acts 2:14–41). How
     are the important topics of Scripture, doctrine, prophecy, Christ,
     gospel, and salvation expressed by Peter, and why are these so
     essential in preaching?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       What an experience it must have been, hearing the fisherman Peter
     preach with such power and authority. His words did not show any
     kind of waffling, any kind of doubt, but rather revealed the Spirit
     working through Him. All through his homily, Peter never wavers,
     but using the Scriptures (then, only the Old Testament) he preaches
     with power the gospel of Jesus Christ, the crucified and risen Messiah,
     who is now “ ‘exalted to the right hand of God’ ” (Acts 2:33). It is
     amazing how, in such a small number of sentences, he covers such an
     incredible amount of information, everything from the outpouring of
     the Holy Spirit, to repentance, to the Second Coming.

What were the results of the preaching at this worship service? See
     Acts 2:41. What can we take away from this for ourselves and our
     Sabbath services?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

        No doubt, this must have been a very special worship service. Yet,
     at the same time, we have the same promises that they had. We have
     the same Bible (and now the New Testament, as well) that they had,
     and we have the same Lord who offers us the same Spirit. Why, then,
     shouldn’t we have worship services with the kind of power we see
     here? What is holding us back?

      Paul on Mars Hill
        In the days of the early church, we can see another example of
      the issue of worship, and of what people worship—this time in the
      ministry of the apostle Paul when he was in Athens, the place where
      three of the world’s most influential philosophers (Socrates, Plato,
      and Aristotle) once lived.
        What a different audience Paul had to deal with here than Peter did
      years earlier before all those devout Jews in Jerusalem!

Read Acts 17:15–34, the account of Paul’s preaching in Athens. How
      different was Paul’s witness to these people from that of Peter’s
      to the audience on the Day of Pentecost?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

        One of the most obvious differences is that, unlike Peter, Paul here
      does not quote the Bible. In fact, he quoted a pagan author instead.
      At the same time, notice how Paul appealed to logic and reason: look
      around at the created world, he was saying, and you will see power-
      ful evidence of the Creator God. He was starting out, using a kind
      of natural theology and pointing to the natural world as a reason to
      believe in the Creator God.
        It is interesting to note the issue of worship here. These people
      were worshiping something that they did not understand. Paul sought
      to take that devotion and worship and turn it away from idols and
      other vain things and toward the living God. Humans seem to have an
      innate need to worship something, anything, and Paul here seeks to
      point them to the only thing truly worthy of their worship.

On what point did some of these people have a real problem, and why?
        In the end, appeals to logic and reason and natural theology can take
      us only so far. Paul, in his witness, then sought to teach them about
      repentance, judgment, and the resurrection, teachings that need to be
      taken on faith. Hence, he did not have that much success with them.
      Though he had a few converts, most seemed to have gone back to
      their worship of what is vain, useless, and unable to save.

       In what ways can our worship services be better able to reach
       out to those who do not have a biblical background, who do
       not start with the same premises we do? How can we make our
       worship services more seeker-friendly?
                                                                         99

      Worship “Contrary to the Law”
         Worship is not just about what you do in church on Sabbath.
      Worship encompasses aspects of our whole faith: what we believe,
      what we proclaim, how we act. Central to worship is the idea of the
      Lord as our Creator and our Redeemer. Everything about worship
      should flow from this fundamental and sacred truth. Again, worship
      is primarily about God and the actions of God in history. Authentic
      worship should draw participants into a closer walk with their Lord.
      It should lead us to a sense of awe, reverence, repentance, and love
      for Him and for others.
         Though we always should be thinking about the Lord (Luke 21:36,
      Ps. 1:2), worship time should be something special, something unique.
      We cannot, however, rely on the church itself or on the worship leaders
      themselves to provide that kind of experience for us, however much
      of a role they can play. In the end, it comes down to ourselves and the
      attitude we bring to church with us on Sabbath.
         At the same time, as we have seen all quarter, worship is a means
      to an end, not an end in itself. Our worship does not save us; rather,
      our worship is one of our responses to being saved.

Read Acts 18:1–16. What charge was laid against Paul, and what
      does that tell us about worship?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         It is fascinating that Paul was charged with persuading people
      toward a different kind of worship, a worship “contrary to the law”
      (vs. 13). (Even the Jews who believed in Jesus at times leveled a simi-
      lar accusation against Paul.) The point in Acts 18 is that these people
      were so caught up in tradition, so caught up in how things were done
      in the past, so caught up in the forms of worship, that when Paul
      presented them with the One who was the whole purpose of their
      worship, the One whom they worshiped without knowing it, the One
      whom all the worship services really pointed to—they rejected what
      he said. So caught up were they in the law itself, they missed the One
      to whom the law pointed.
         Again, though our circumstances today are radically different from
      Paul’s back then, we need to be careful not to allow our forms and
      traditions to get in the way of what our faith really should be about.
      Any worship that does not lead us directly to the Cross is misguided.

      Love Conquers All
        It is so easy, from our perspective today, to look back at the early
      church as some sort of model of harmony and peace, an example of
      what true worship was all about. Unfortunately, New Testament his-
      tory is so similar to Old Testament history in that both show just how
      far fallen we all are.
        Take, for example, the church in Corinth, which Paul established on
      his second missionary journey. A commercial hub, known for its luxury
      and wealth, Corinth was also a center of one of the most sensual and
      degrading religions of that era. Influenced by their culture, immorality
      and dissension had invaded the church. And yet, as bad as it was, it was
      not the only problem there. Paul addressed other issues that were causing
      factions to develop in the church, including idolatry (1 Cor. 10:14) and
      the seeming overemphasis of the gifts, especially the misuse of the gift of
      tongues for self-seeking motives (1 Corinthians 14).

In the midst of his discourse to the Corinthians and all their problems,
      Paul gives them the famous chapter, 1 Corinthians 13. What is the
      essential message here? More important, how can we apply this to
      our lives and worship today?

        Paul suggested that no profession we make, no mighty miracles,
      no charismatic gifts, and no piety or zeal will profit us unless there is
      a heart filled with love for God, confirmed by love for one another.
      That, says Paul, is the ultimate gift for which we should seek, which
      may not be substituted with anything less.
        Spiritual gifts are helpful, and Christians should use their gifts to
      honor God and to build up the church in unity. But never should any
      spiritual gift be used for display of self, personal gain, or in a disor-
      derly way in worship or otherwise.
        In the end, a church filled with loving, dedicated Christians will
      exert an influence and power that extend far beyond the weekly wor-
      ship service.

       How much does unselfish love for others impact your daily
       life? That is, how much of your own time and energy do you
       spend on seeking to minister to others? How much of self are
       you willing to renounce, all for the good of other people? It is
       not so easy, is it?
                                                                            101

             “Holiness is not rapture: it is an entire surrender of the will to
          God; it is living by every word that proceeds from the mouth of
          God; . . . it is walking by faith . . . it is relying on God with unques-
          tioning confidence, and resting in His love.”—Ellen G. White, The
          Acts of the Apostles, p. 51.

          secution for Christ’s sake? It was union with God, . . . with the Holy
          Spirit, . . . with Christ. Reproach and persecution have separated many
          from earthly friends, but never from the love of Christ.”—p. 85.
             “[These] consecrated messengers . . . allowed no thought of self-
          exaltation to mar their presentation of Christ. . . . They coveted neither
2         authority nor pre-eminence.”—p. 209.
             “By idolatry he [Paul] meant not only the worship of idols, but
          self-serving, love of ease, the gratification of appetite and passion.”

    Discussion Questions:
           l
           1 In class talk about all the reasons we have for faith. What
           “proofs” do we have for what we believe? What rational and logi-
3
           cal evidence do we have that helps affirm us in our beliefs? At
           the same time, what are the challenges to our faith? In the end,
           even despite these challenges, why do we believe what we do?

           l
           2 Think about some of the most powerful worship services you
           ever have attended. What made them so special, so powerful?
           What elements in particular made the difference? How could
           these elements be brought into your local church worship, if they
           are not there already?		

           l
           3 What are some of the potential ways in which our worship
           services actually could impede our view of Christ and the Cross?
           How can we make sure that nothing is allowed to do that?

           l
           4 Dwell more on 1 Corinthians 13. What concrete steps could
           your church take to manifest the love that Paul talks about
           here?

Making a Difference
   Catherine didn’t choose to study at the Adventist University at Cosendai
in Cameroon. Her brother, an Adventist pastor, urged her to study there.
Even though the university was just developing and still lacked many of
the resources of more established schools, Catherine’s parents gave their
permission too. They had seen the difference the Adventist faith had made
in Catherine’s brother’s life.
   When Catherine’s friends learned that she was planning to study at an
Adventist university, they warned her not to go, not to join the Adventist
Church. “We won’t be your friends if you become an Adventist,” they
threatened.
   Catherine resisted the Adventist influence, even though she attended
worship and chapel services several times a week, sat through count-
less classes that began with prayer, and studied the Bible in her religion
classes. She made friends with other students and noticed the difference
in the lives of the Adventist students. The impact of daily prayers and
frequent conversations about faith and God challenged her thinking. “I
couldn’t help but think about God,” she says. She began feeling God draw
her to Himself.
   Her non-Adventist friends urged her not to give in to the religious influ-
ence at the school. “You can be a Christian without being an Adventist,”
one friend said. Others urged her to remain faithful to her family’s reli-
gion. Catherine had resisted God’s call as long as she could. But the call
of God was stronger, and at the end of a Week of Prayer Catherine took
her stand to follow Jesus.
   “I hope that the way God has changed my life will draw my friends to
Jesus,” she says. “I’m not a preacher, and I don’t want to force them to
follow my example. I just want them to see the difference Jesus is making
in my life and consider asking Jesus to change their lives too.
   “The Adventist University in Cameroon may not be fancy, but it has
made a huge difference in my life. I have received far more than a degree
here; I will have found Christ as my Lord and Savior.”
   This quarter the Adventist University at Cosendai will receive part
of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering to help build its new campus. Your
special offering will help grow this university, and your weekly mission
offerings will help people in Cameroon and around the world build believ-
ers for eternity.



Catherine Ligo is a graduate of the Adventist University at Cosendai, where she majored

        Lesson            13 *September 17–23
      Worship in the Book of
      Revelation


      Sabbath Afternoon				
Read for This Week’s Study: Rev. 1:13–18, Job 42:1–6,
      Rev. 19:1–5, Revelation 13, 14:6–12.

Memory Text: “And they sung as it were a new song before the
      throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man
      could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thou-
      sand, which were redeemed from the earth” (Revelation 14:3).



      F
             ew books of the Bible hold as much mystery and fascination as
             does Revelation. It is filled with incredible images of beasts and
             dragons and fire and earthquakes and plagues and armies and
      frogs and cities and falling stars and so forth.
         And yet, amid all the drama, the theme that repeatedly appears is
      worship. Whether dealing with the final crisis regarding those who
      worship the beast and its image, or revealing beings in heaven who
      sing praises to God, Revelation comes back again and again to wor-
      ship: worship of Him who “liveth for ever and ever” (Rev. 5:14),
      worship of Him “which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou
      has taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned” (Rev. 11:17), and
      worship of the One who is to receive “glory and honour and power”
      (Rev. 4:11).
         In short, Revelation reveals what we have been looking at all quar-
      ter: that the Lord alone, our Creator, our Redeemer, our Judge—is
      worthy of our worship and praise.

     “I Fell at His Feet as Dead”
        Perhaps one of the greatest revelations we have been given of the
     majesty and power of God has come to us through astronomy. Most of
     the ancients had no idea of the size and expanse of the cosmos. In the
     twentieth century, with the incredible advances in various telescopes,
     we have been given a view of the universe that would have baffled
     most of the ancients. Indeed, we ourselves are baffled by it, by the
     size, by the distances, and by the incredible number of galaxies and
     stars. We barely can wrap our minds around it all.
        And here is the amazing thing: only something greater than the
     cosmos could have created the cosmos, in the same way that only
     something greater than a painting could have created the painting.
     Thus, the God whom we worship, the God whom we serve, is the
     Creator of the universe; hence, He is greater than it all.
        Who, then, are we in contrast to such a God?

Read Revelation 1:13–18, John’s depiction of Jesus, as revealed to
     him there. What is his reaction, and why would he react that way?
     How is the Cross presented here?

     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

Read Job 42:1–6. How does Job’s reaction compare with John’s?
     _______________________________________________________

     _______________________________________________________

       Though both these men were given only a partial revelation of the
     Lord, what they saw was enough to greatly humble them. There was
     fear, reverence, awe, and a sense of repentance in their reactions.
     How could there not be? They were getting a view of the Creator
     of the universe; more so, they were sinful beings getting a view of a
     sinless and holy God. No doubt, a realization of their own sinfulness,
     their own unrighteousness, their own filth, rose up in them before the
     presence of the Lord.

      How should our worship services elicit in us a similar reaction?
      That is, shouldn’t we be given a sense of the presence of God,
      which should humble us? At the same time, how crucial that the
      Cross be lifted up before us as our only hope of salvation.

      Holy, Holy, Holy . . .
        		
        Though the book of Revelation still holds many mysteries, the
      dominant motif comes through time and time again, and that is, of
      worship. All through Revelation are scenes of various beings wor-
      shiping the Lord.

Read the following texts. What can we learn about worship from
      what appears in them? What themes appear here that we have
      seen throughout this quarter?
      Rev. 4:8–11______________________________________________

      Rev. 5:8–14______________________________________________

      Rev. 7:9–12______________________________________________

      Rev. 11:15–19____________________________________________

      Rev. 15:1–4______________________________________________

      Rev. 19:1–5______________________________________________


         Among all the things that Revelation can teach us, one thing should
      stand out: what happens on earth impacts heaven, and what happens
      in heaven impacts earth. Heaven and earth are, as we have been told,
      closer than we might think. Revelation shows us just how close.
      Indeed, time and again the beings in heaven are worshiping God for
      what He has done on earth.
         What, too, are the themes of praise and worship seen here but
      themes we have been looking at all quarter? The Lord as Creator, the
      Lord as Redeemer, the Lord as Judge. He is praised for His holiness,
      He is praised for the shedding of His blood, He is praised and wor-
      shiped for His power, for His might, and for His honor. He is praised
      for His justice and judgment and for the salvation He offers.

       Think again through the plan of salvation, of what it means and
       what God has given us through it. Don’t we have so much to
       praise Him for? Whatever your struggles, whatever your trials,
       take time every day to praise the Lord for all that you have to
       be thankful about. It will change your life.

     Revelation 13
        From the introduction onward, we have seen how the final end-time
     crisis will center on the question of worship. The issue of worship is not
     a small matter. The eternal destiny of souls hangs on it. This crucial truth
     becomes more apparent in what unfolds in Revelation 13 and 14.

Read Revelation 13 and answer the following questions:

       1. What is the historical context of these verses? What are they talk-
     ing about historically and prophetically?
     _______________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________

      2. How often does the theme of worship appear in this chapter?
     What does that tell us about how central it is?
     _______________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________

       3. Where is the gospel, the salvation offered to us in Christ, pre-
     sented in this chapter?
     _______________________________________________________
     _______________________________________________________

        From the beginning of the great controversy, Satan sought to
     subvert the authority and power of God. The battle that he started in
     heaven is now being played out on the earth. This chapter shows the
     enemy’s work through history, through the powers presented there,
     and how it will climax in the final crisis surrounding the issue of wor-
     ship: all those who do not worship the beast and his image will face
     economic and physical persecution. Even though Satan knows that
     he is defeated, even though, at the Cross it was over for him, he still
     continues to fight, still continues to seek deceiving as many as he can,
     and he will do so right up to the end.
        Yet, in the midst of all this, we have Revelation 13:8, which refers
     to Jesus as “the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world”; that
     is, even before all this began on earth, the “everlasting covenant”
     (Heb. 13:20) had been in place, offering all humans the opportunity
     for salvation. Those who truly have accepted that salvation, whose
     names are in the book of life, shall not worship the beast or his image.
     They are worshiping, instead, the One who “washed us from our sins
     in his own blood’ (Rev. 1:5), and we will no doubt be doing the same,
     worshiping Him, in heaven, as well.
                                                                            107
           W ednesday September 21

      Revelation 14
        Revelation 14 opens with what? A heavenly scene, showing the
      144,000 who were “redeemed from the earth” (vs. 3). It starts out with
      a vision of the future, of what it will be like, at least for this group,
      when they stand before God in heaven. And though the text doesn’t
      come right out and say it, this certainly seems to be a depiction of
      some sort of heavenly worship.
        Thus, Revelation 14 continues the theme of worship found in
      chapter 13. These people didn’t worship the beast and his image but
      instead are seen worshiping their Lord in heaven.
        The chapter then returns to earth, picking up where chapter 13 left
      off, where those who worshiped the beast and his image were shown
      in contrast to those who would not, those whose names were written
      in the book of life.

Read Revelation 14:6–12. Why are these texts so central, so crucial
      to us as Seventh-day Adventists? What themes appear here that
      we have been looking at all quarter? Why do we call these verses
      “present truth”?

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

      _______________________________________________________

         These verses are rich and ripe with truth: Creation, Redemption, judg-
      ment, salvation, the gospel, obedience, faith, the Ten Commandments,
      and mission. Here, too, we can see the fiercest warning in all the
      Bible, and it centers on the question of worship: “And the smoke of
      their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest
      day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever
      receiveth the mark of his name” (Rev. 14:11).
         As Seventh-day Adventists, we understand how central to this
      whole issue the seventh-day Sabbath is, which is so tied in with
      Creation and with worship. We worship the Lord because He is the
      Creator, and the Sabbath has been and still remains the foundational
      mark, or sign, of His role as Creator.
         Though we still do not know when, and how, these issues will be
      brought to the forefront, we can be sure that they will. How crucial it
      is, then, that we be ready, not only to stand firm for the truth but also
      to be able “to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of
      the hope that is in you with meekness and fear” (1 Pet. 3:15).

Worship God
   “And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had
heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel
which shewed me these things. Then saith he unto me, See thou do
it not: for I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets,
and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God” (Rev.
22:8, 9). Read the context of these two verses. What’s the essential
message here about worship?

_______________________________________________________

_______________________________________________________

   All quarter we have seen the same thing: humans have this innate
need to worship. Even good things. Here John wants to worship the
heavenly messenger who has revealed to him so much incredible
truth. And yet, he is told to stop and worship God.
   This is not the first time he has had this experience. In Revelation
19:10, he is about to do the same thing, and again, he is stopped and
told to worship the Lord. It reminds one of Christ’s words to Satan:
“Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve”
(Matt. 4:10).
   In both cases, too, John fell at the feet of the object he sought to wor-
ship, a symbol of surrender, of submission, and of reverence before the
object of worship. Anything else is not really worship, is it?
   And that is because worship is not merely about what we do on
Sabbath for a few hours each week. Worship is about falling at the
feet of our Lord all the time. It is about our entire attitude and relation-
ship to God. Worship is what we should be doing 24/7; it is about liv-
ing a life of faith, of obedience, and of surrender to the Lord. Worship
is about putting God first and foremost in all that we say, all that we
do, and all that we think. Worship is how we treat others, how we
treat those we love, and those who are hard to love. Worship is about
obeying the commandments, it is about ministering to those in need,
it is about dying to self and proclaiming the gospel.
    Again, think about Creation, think about the God who created the
creation. Then think about the Cross, about the Creator dying for the
sins of those whom He had created, bearing in Himself the punishment
that they deserved in order that these undeserving beings could have the
chance of being re-created in a new heaven and a new earth.
   Because God created all that exists, anything else we worship is
simply our worshiping more creation, worshiping idols of one form or
another, worshiping what cannot save us. In contrast, with the image
of the Creator on the cross, the question is, why would we want to
worship anything or anyone else?
                                                                       109

    Further Study: Read Ellen G. White, “The Impending Conflict,”
          pp. 582–592; “The Final Warning,” pp. 603–612, “The Controversy
          Ended,” pp. 662–678, in The Great Controversy.

             “Worship is bending low before our Maker, recognizing and
          acknowledging His holiness and our creatureliness. It is submitting to
          His sovereignty, responding to His majestic presence.”—Richard M.
          Davidson, Andrews University, Worship in the Old Testament (used
1         by permission of the author), p. 3.
             “The Psalmist states: ‘Serve the Lord with fear [awe]; rejoice with
          trembling’ (Ps. 2:11). In worship we recognize the awesome majesty
          and infinite power of the King; we remember that ‘Our God is a con-
          suming fire’ (Deut 4:24; Heb 12:29) that would instantly consume
          us if it were not for the substitutionary sacrifice of Jesus who was
2         ‘consumed’ on the altar of Calvary in our place.
             “Thus our worship will keep a balance between joy and awe. It
          will be a holy joy. . . . Our worship must have awesome depth . . .
          yet vibrant joy.”—p. 30.
             “The redeemed raise a song of praise that echoes and re-echoes
          through the vaults of heaven: ‘Salvation to our God which sitteth upon
          the throne, and unto the Lamb,’ verse 10 [of Revelation 7]. . . .
             “In all that shining throng there are none to ascribe salvation to
3         themselves, as if they had prevailed by their own power and goodness.
          Nothing is said of what they have done or suffered; but the burden of
          every song, the keynote of every anthem, is: Salvation to our God and
          unto the Lamb.”—Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, p. 665.

    Discussion Questions:
           l
           1 In class, discuss in more detail the plan of redemption, the
           miracle of the Incarnation, the sinless life of Jesus, His death on
           our behalf, and the promise of His second coming. Why does all
           this make Christ so worthy of worship?

           l2 What are ways that we worship the Lord when we are not in
           church service? If we are not worshiping the Lord all the time,
           can we truly worship him for a few hours on Sabbath? Discuss
           your answer.

           3 What are some good things that we could be in danger of
           worshiping?

God’s Gentle Nudges
by Armindo Cachiaia
   No one event, no single person led me to the Seventh-day Adventist
Church. But as I look back, I realize that God was nudging me in that
direction since I was a child.
   When I first heard that some people worship on the Sabbath, I wondered
why anyone would worship on Saturday instead of Sunday. Then a classmate
saw me reading a small booklet that featured the Ten Commandments on
the cover. He told me that the Ten Commandments, including the fourth
one, were still binding on God’s people. I didn’t pay too much attention
at that time, but years later I remembered this.
   When I finished school and married, my wife and I joined a Protestant
church. An Adventist man I knew spoke to me of the Sabbath, and again
I wondered about it. But mounting leadership assignments in church kept
me too busy to think about the Sabbath.
   Then God put the question of the Sabbath in my mind again. It bothered
me. I realized that I had to answer this question once and for all. When
I met Adventists in my travels, I asked them about the Sabbath. They
answered with conviction and quoted Bible texts to back up what they
said.
   I became busier and busier in my church, but the Sabbath question never
went away. Finally I resigned my positions in my church and decided to
visit an Adventist church to learn for myself whether the Sabbath was
really God’s holy day.
   My wife refused to go with me, but I went anyway. The church wasn’t
perfect; the people weren’t perfect. But I knew I was hearing Bible truth,
and I felt I had found my spiritual home. My 14-year-old son went with
me, and we began studying the Bible together. Soon both of us were con-
vinced. I continued to invite my wife, and after five months she agreed to
go. My son and I were baptized, and later my wife joined us.
   I know that God led us to His truth by gently nudging me over the
years. I’m a local elder now, and I’m helping to plant another company
of believers in the area. My wife and son are also active members. I’m
overjoyed that as a result of my conversion some members of my former
church are asking questions about what Adventists believe. Others are
attending the Adventist church, and some have joined the church.
   Our mission offerings help provide materials to teach honest-hearted
people about God. But sometimes God nudges us toward His truths. For
that I’m grateful.

2011    Bible Study Guide for the Fourth Quarter

          Paul’s letter to the Galatians has been compared to spiritual
       dynamite, and rightly so. Along with Romans, no other book in the
       Bible has sparked as much revival and reformation. What is it about
       Galatians that has made it such a backbone of spiritual revival?
       Unlike any other book in the Bible, Galatians addresses a number
       of themes crucial to the Christian soul. It tackles issues such as
       freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ,
       and the nature of the spirit-led life.
          Next quarter’s Bible study guide, The Gospel in Galatians by
       Carl Cosaert, invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he
       pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus and gives us a
       chance to reflect on our own understanding of the gospel. It is our
       hope that God’s Spirit will spark a spiritual revival in our hearts as
       we rediscover what God has done for us in Christ.

Lesson 1—Apostle to the Gentiles
     The Week at a Glance:
        Sunday: Persecutor of the Christians (Acts 7:58)
        Monday: Saul’s Conversion (Acts 9:5)
        Tuesday: Saul in Damascus (Acts 9:10–14)
        Wednesday: The Gospel Goes to the Gentiles (Acts 11:19–21, 26)
        Thursday: Conflict Within the Church (Acts 10:1–11:18)
     Memory Text—Acts 11:18
     Sabbath Gem: God had far different plans for Saul, plans that Saul
      never could have anticipated for himself. Not only would this perse-
      cutor of the Christians become one himself and preach Jesus as the
      Messiah, but he would preach this message among the Gentiles.

Lesson 2—Paul’s Authority and Gospel
     The Week at a Glance:
        Sunday: Paul, the Letter Writer (2 Peter 3:15, 16)
        Monday: Paul’s Calling (Gal. 1:1, 2)
        Tuesday: Paul’s Gospel (Gal. 1:3–5)
        Wednesday: No Other Gospel (Gal. 1:6–9, 5:12)
        Thursday: The Origin of Paul’s Gospel (Gal. 1:11–24)
     Memory Text—Galatians 1:10
     Sabbath Gem: Paul’s teaching that the Gentiles could become
      Christians on the basis of faith alone was under attack by false
      teachers who insisted that they first needed to be circumcised. Paul
      considered this an attack on the very essence of the gospel itself.
