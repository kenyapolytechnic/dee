                        Witnessing:

             Turning the World Upside Down



   The book of Acts begins with a short account of Jesus' last days
on earth, after which Luke swiftly moves into his stirring portrayals
of the spread of the gospel and the growth of the church. He begins
these portrayals with a description of Jesus' followers as they are
being filled with the Holy Spirit (Acts 2), an event that launched
them into the world with a power never before seen.
    The imagery in Acts 2:3 symbolizes the will of God for all Chris-
tians and the goals all Christians should have:
    (1) the communication of the gospel (tongues), and
    (2) the sanctifying presence of God, which purifies us of sinful
characteristics and sets our hearts aflame with the desire and the
power to witness (fire).
    Just as these tongues of fire "separated and came to rest on each of
them" (NIV) in the upper room, so each of us can be filled with the
Holy Spirit in order to communicate the gospel with energy and
passion. This quarter, travel with your fellow Sabbath School mem-
bers through the book of Acts to learn not only how the early Chris-
tians witnessed but how you can apply their methods to your particu-
lar place and time.
    As you study, keep in mind those you know who have not com-
mitted their lives to Jesus Christ. Ask God what part He would have
you play in their conversion. Then as Jesus' followers did, not only
in the beginning of Acts but throughout the entire book, pray without
ceasing for the Holy Spirit's power. Then the glory and the story of
Acts will be not only theirs but yours as well!
    This Bible Study Guide does not discuss all the illustrations of
witnessing that exist in the book of Acts. "The whole of the book of
Acts should receive careful study. It is full of precious instruction; it
 records experiences in evangelistic work, the teachings of which we
 need in our work today."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible
 Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1051. In addition to studying this guide, why
 not see what other examples of witnessing in the book of Acts you
 can find?

    You have relatives and friends who haven't come to God. You
  love these people. They're smart. Fun. Skeptical. They're "good
  people." And they may be lost forever.
    You have wondered if you could ever share anything that
  could open doors for them. Now there's an option.
     Searching for a God to Love, by former Insight editor Chris
  Blake, speaks directly to the needs of the "believing unbeliev-
  ers" and the "unbelieving believers." Those thinking people
  (including Seventh-day Adventists) who desperately desire a
  belief system that makes sense to them; something that goes
  beyond proof texts and anecdotal, simplistic reasoning; some-
                             thing that deals with hurtful issues and
                             irksome questions; something contem-
                             porary that addresses where they are

                             never found a God they could love.

     Witnessing: A Christian
         Fundamental




Sabbath Afternoon
"SDA SHOE MAKER." So reads the sign by the road in the town of
Agusan del Sur, Philippines. At Washington Dulles International Air-
port, a businesswoman, delayed for more than an hour, shares religious
tracts along with her business cards to other waiting passengers. A
photographer in Zacateculoca, El Salvador, consistently leads tens, and
sometimes more than a hundred people, to Jesus every year. Some of the
youth in your church go with their Sabbath School leader to conduct a
branch Sabbath School at an orphanage on Sabbath afternoons.
   Their circumstances vary greatly. But what one thing do all these
people have in common? They love their Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,
and are serving as His witnesses. As you study this week's lesson, pray
that God will help you to be aware of that special witnessing place He
has designated just for you!

WHAT IS A WITNESS? (Acts 9:1-22; 22:15, 16, 20).

   What charge did Paul receive on the day of his baptism? Acts 22:15,
16. Based on his conversion experience in Acts 9:1-22, list at least
three principles of witnessing. What phrases attract your attention?


    DEFINITION: A witness is a person who can give a first-
    hand account of something. "That which we have seen and
    heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship
    with us" (1 John 1:3).



   Witnessing is not something we do because it is a "program" of our
local church. It is a natural result of our conversion and commitment to
Jesus. We witness because we are in love with Him. One reason for a
lack of real witnessing among some of us is that we know little of Jesus
and His power in our own lives. We cannot witness if we have nothing
to share. "No sooner does one come to Christ than there is born in his
heart a desire to make known to others what a precious friend he has
found in Jesus. . . . If we have tasted and seen that the Lord is good we
shall have something to tell."—Steps to Christ, p. 78.
   The apostles had seen and heard events about which they were
eager to tell others. Death might silence them. But they could not deny
their experience. We become powerful witnesses when the joy and the
assurance of salvation work wonders in our life.

   What word did Paul use to describe Stephen? What is the impor-
tance of that word? Acts 22:20.


   The Greek word for "witness" is martus. Martus is also the root for
the English term martyr. "Now, a martyr is one who is convinced of
truth, and manifests it in life and death. The fires of persecution do not
make martyrs; they simply reveal them. The man who is not already a
martyr never lays down his life for the truth. The martyrs died, not that
they might become martyrs, but because they were martyrs."—LeRoy
E. Froom, The Coming of the Comforter, rev. ed. (Hagerstown, Md.:
Review and Herald, 1956), pp. 106, 107.

    What would happen if church members sacrificed not only time
 and money but life itself in order to share Jesus and communicate the
 gospel? Should we wait until the latter rain falls to develop that
 attitude? Why, or why not? How can you serve Jesus as a witness now?

                                                                         7
Monday                                                     June 26
THE GOAL OF WITNESSING (Matt. 28:18-20).

    According to Matthew 28:18-20, what is the goal of witnessing?


  Identify the action words (verbs) of Christ's great commission.
Matt. 28:19, 20.


   The first verb, "go," could be translated to mean "as you go" or
"while going." "Baptizing" and "teaching" also are action verbs. They
indicate how we are to make disciples. The one command is "make
disciples."
   What is a disciple?



     DEFINITION: The word disciple means 'followers of a
     master," "people who follow the discipline taught by a
     teacher." The term is equal to Christian. In the book of
     Acts, it refers to those who confess Jesus as the Christ.
     Discipleship suggests the idea of total attachment to some-
     one. Disciples are people who are committed to making
     Jesus the Lord of their life.



   Disciples are eager to use their spiritual gifts to advance God's
kingdom because Christ's love motivates them to do so. They have
been born again by the Holy Spirit. Because they are new creatures in
Christ, they will have characteristics that the world will recognize as
different from their own. They will not be perfect. But they are part of
God's family. For example, Peter was among the disciples. He was not
perfect after Pentecost, but he was committed to Jesus, and he was
willing to obey Him.
   Discipleship also implies a continuing work toward maturity, a grow-
ing to new stages where the disciple will bring others to a saving
relationship with Jesus.

    Is it possible to be a "church member" and not be a "disciple"?
Explain. How willing are you to make the goal of the Great Com-
mission one of your personal goals? Examine your life carefully.
Do you feel you are committed to making Jesus the Lord of your
life? If not, how can you make such a commitment?

   Read each text in the chart below. Then tell what reason it suggests
for witnessing.

   Witnessing is necessary from two points of view: the Christian's
and the non-Christian's. Christians need to witness, because there
is something inside them that wants to tell others about Jesus. Non-
Christians need someone to witness to them because only by learning
about Jesus and accepting His sacrifice can they know the way of
salvation.
    Philip's experience with the Ethiopian teaches us that for our witness
to be meaningful, we should be aware of the concerns and needs of the
people to whom we direct our witness. Ask them questions. Listen to
their answers. Let their focus be your starting point in sharing Jesus'
love. In so doing, they will learn over time that Jesus is indeed the
way, the truth, and the light.

    Witnessing also brings spiritual power: "Strength to resist
 evil is best gained by aggressive service."—The Acts of the Apostles,
 p. 105. List other reasons for witnessing.

                                                                        9

THREE BASIC APPROACHES TO WITNESSING (Daniel 1;
Matthew 5-7; Acts 18:4).

     In what office did Philip serve the church? Acts 21:8.



     DEFINITION: Evangelism is the proclamation of the
     good news of Jesus Christ. It is the presentation of Jesus—
     who He is, what He has done and is doing, and what He
     has taught. Evangelism presents biblical teachings through
     the power of the Holy Spirit in such a way that people
     will be persuaded to accept Jesus as their Savior and
     serve Him in the fellowship of the church. An evangelist
     is one who announces the Good News.

    The three basic approaches to evangelism are:
    1. Presence evangelism. This deals with the impact of the Christian
lifestyle. We evangelize by living the gospel. This involves a positive
testimony. In the mission field, presence evangelism may take the
form of medical or agricultural work. By meeting people's needs, the
evangelist opens their hearts to the preaching of God's Word.
    2. Proclamation evangelism. The emphasis of this approach is on
the explanation of Scripture. Most Sabbath morning sermons take this
approach. Preachers help people to understand the gospel. But they do
not know whether anyone in the audience has made a commitment.
    3. Persuasion evangelism. This method illustrates the traditional
understanding of evangelism. The emphasis of this approach is on
doctrine. It persuades people to make a decision for Jesus and His truth.
A preacher who, during Sabbath morning services, invites the congre-
gation to respond under the power of the Holy Spirit through an appeal
or an altar call is utilizing persuasion evangelism.

  Which method of evangelism does each text below describe? Why do
you think so?
     Acts 18:4
     Daniel 1

     Matthew 5-7

   Review the definition of evangelism in the box above. Explain how
each of the evangelistic methods described below it fits this definition.
Why do we need all three methods? Which method does your local
church use the most? Which one are you actively participating in?

WITNESSING AS A MATTER OF OBEDIENCE (Acts 5:17-42).

   The Sanhedrin, called "the council" in the book of Acts, exercised its
control in civil and political, as well as in religious, affairs. Composed
of seventy men, it was the main governing body of the Hebrew people.
The high priest presided over the council. When the apostles were
brought before the council, the high priest denounced them, declaring,
" 'We gave you strict orders not to teach in this [Jesus'] name . . . yet
you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to
make us guilty of this man's blood' " (Acts 5:27, 28, NIV).

   To what higher command did the apostles refer? Acts 5:29.


   In Acts, we find the church heavily involved in witnessing. Another
term for what the church did is "evangelizing," even though this word
does not appear in Acts very often. The apostles risked their own lives
in order to obey God. They could not deny what had happened in their
lives and what they had seen with their own eyes. "In the history of
prophets and apostles, are many noble examples of loyalty to God.
Christ's witnesses have endured imprisonment, torture, and death
itself, rather than break God's commands."—The Acts of the Apostles,
p. 81.
    The apostles "never asked, 'Is this course of action safe?' They
asked, 'Is this what God wants me to do?' "—William Barclay, The Acts
of the Apostles, rev. ed. (Philadelphia, Penn.: The Westminster Press,
1976), p. 48.

   How did the apostles react to the instructions of the council? Acts
5:40-42.


   In such behavior lies the solution to many problems. People re-
spond differently to opposition. Some, preferring peace, are easily
scared into silence. Others will make sure that the world knows how
unjustly they have been treated. But few souls do not flinch at suffering
for Christ's sake. Jesus Himself declared such persons "blessed" (Matt.
5:10-12). The ability of the church to withstand opposition excited the
people. And "the number of the disciples was multiplied" (Acts 6:1).

    If the lawmakers of your country or city were to declare
 witnessing a crime, would you be found guilty or be ignored for
 lack of evidence? In what circumstances should Christians risk
 disobeying civil laws that restrict their obligation to witness?

FURTHER STUDY: What activities in Jesus' ministry may be con-
sidered as witnessing, and why? What witnessing events do you recall
from the Old Testament? Under what method would you classify
Jesus' witnessing activities and those you recall from the Old Testa-
ment? (see Wednesday's lesson). What principles about witnessing
can we learn from both Jesus' ministry and the witnessing events of
the Old Testament?
   Read Ellen G. White, Christian Service, "A Call to the Individual"
pp. 9-13. What activities are described as "the highest missionary
work" in Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 41?

   "The church of Christ on earth was organized for missionary pur-
poses, and the Lord desires to see the entire church devising ways and
means whereby high and low, rich and poor, may hear the message of
truth."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 29.
   "Our work has been marked out for us by our heavenly Father. We
are to take our Bibles and go forth to warn the world. We are to be God's
helping hands in saving souls—channels through which His love is
day by day to flow to the perishing."—Testimonies for the Church, vol.
9, p. 150.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. In the New Testament, evangelism and discipleship are closely
     linked. But what is the difference between them? How can we
     combine them?

     2. As you review Paul's conversion experience in Acts 9:1-18, pay
        special attention to Ananias. What does his part in this story
        teach us about witnessing?

     3. Review the definition of a martyr in Sunday's lesson. How are
        people martyrs in life before they become martyrs in death?

SUMMARIZE in your own words the following concepts from this
week's lesson: (1) What is a witness? (Acts 9:1-22; 22:15, 16, 20).
(2) What is the goal of witnessing? (Matt. 28:19, 20). (3) What are
some reasons for witnessing? (Acts 8:26-31; 2 Pet. 3:9; 2 Cor. 5:14).
(4) List and explain the three basic approaches to witnessing (Daniel
1; Matthew 5-7; Acts 18:4). (5) Why is witnessing a matter of obedi-
ence? (Acts 5:17-42).
   How has this week's lesson made you feel about witnessing? What
will you do differently because of what you have learned?

                       "It Is Safe Now"
                           J. H. Zachary

    For many months a gang of "rascals," ruthless criminals,
terrorized a section of the Eastern Highlands Mission in Papua
New Guinea. Two hundred violent youth robbed and raped trav-
elers between the cities of Goroka and Lae.
    Midway between these cities the highway passes between two
hills. Gang members would watch for traffic from the north.
When a lone vehicle approached, they signaled their companions
on the hill overlooking the narrow passage, who alerted a third
group of rascals, who stopped the vehicle and carried out their
criminal and often violent deeds.
    Several Adventist churches serve the communities in this area
of Papua New Guinea. Members were deeply concerned over the
increasingly violent nature of crimes being committed by these
gangs. They took their concern to the Lord in earnest prayer and
discussed possible solutions. Finally, the members agreed on a
solution to make their community safe once again. Carefully they
laid their plans.
    Nearly everyone who lives in the region knows which youth
are gang members or sympathizers. Pairs of Adventists visited
the homes of these people and challenged the gang members to
come to a meeting at the church. "Surely you do not want to
spend the rest of your life as a rascal. God wants something better
for you. He loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life. We
have prepared a special seminar for all the rascals in this commu-
nity. Please come."
    And many of the rascals came to the meeting and continued to
attend the evangelistic meetings prepared just for them. Before
the meetings ended, 107 of the rascals came forward to express
their desire to begin a new life with Jesus. In just over a year that
number reached 200.
    As the pastor in this region and I passed through this once-
dangerous spot on the highway between Goroka and Lae, the
 pastor told me, "It is safe to travel here now."
    Praise God for the transforming power of the gospel that changes
 lives and gives each person hope for the future and a better life
 today.

Quiet Hour and a special consultant for the General Conference

        The Power and Joy of
             Witnessing




Sabbath Afternoon
A LOOSE CONNECTION. Herbert Jackson told a seminary mission
class that while he was a missionary, he was given a car that would not
start without a push.When he would leave to make his rounds for the
day, students from the nearby mission school would cease their studies
to give him the push he needed. Then as he visited people throughout
his territory, he would either leave the car on a hill or keep it running.
   For two years, he fussed this way over his car. When his replacement
came, Jackson informed him about the car's temperament. Curious, his
replacement looked under the hood. "Dr. Jackson!" he exclaimed. "The
only trouble with this car is a loose cable!" After tightening the offending
line, Jackson's replacement got into the car and turned the key. The
vehicle blasted to life. The power had been there all the time. Only a
loose connection prevented Jackson from using it.—Craig Brian Larson,
editor, Illustrations for Preaching and Teaching: From Leadership Journal
(Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Book House, 1993), p. 182; adapted. So it
is with the Holy Spirit. He is the power behind any witnessing we do.

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE:
  I. Searching Within (Acts 1:14; 2:1).
 11. Conditions for Enabling Baptism (Acts 1:5, 8, 14).

 V. Fasting (Acts 9:7-9, 18, 19; 13:1-3; 14:21-23).

MEMORY TEXT: "And with great power gave the apostles wit-
ness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was
upon them all" (Acts 4:33).

SEARCHING WITHIN (Acts 1:14; 2:1).

  What were the believers praying for while they were gathered in the
upper room?

  Acts 1:14


   Luke 24:49


   Acts 1:4

  What does it mean that they "continued with one accord"?
(Acts 1:14).


    In Acts 1:14 and 2:46, the phrase "with one accord" means "perse-
vered with one mind." In chapter 2:1, important evidence supports the
translation "they were all together" (see SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6,
pp. 10, 127, 134). Contrast the mood now apparent with the one at the
Last Supper (Luke 22:24).
    As the days passed, how easy it would have been to criticize one
another! Some could have pointed to Peter's oaths and curses, others
to Thomas's doubting nature. More than one could have remembered
that the sons of Zebedee had actually asked for the two chief seats in
the kingdom, and some could have commented about Mary Magdalene's
past. How could the Lord bless such a group of people?
    "Oh, it is so easy to turn the searchlight on others instead of on
self. . . . We are prone to blame others for our own lack of power. But
Pentecost proves that if our repentance is true and deep, no blessing is
withheld because of past sins. Thank God for that! Let us then draw
together, and draw near to Him. Then the Spirit will come."—Froom,
 The Coming of the Comforter, p. 110.
    "As the disciples waited for the fulfillment of the promise, they
humbled their hearts in true repentance and confessed their unbe-
lief."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 36. "The disciples prayed with
intense earnestness for a fitness to meet men and in their daily inter-
course to speak words that would lead sinners to Christ. Putting away
 all differences, all desire for the supremacy, they came close together in
 Christian fellowship."—Page 37.

   Would I have been among the ones getting ready to receive the
 power of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost? How can I make sure I am
 among the ones today who are searching to connect with Him?

                                                                        15

CONDITIONS FOR ENABLING BAPTISM (Acts 1:5, 8, 14).

  Even though the disciples had already been baptized with water,
what other baptism did the Lord promise them? Acts 1:5, 8,14 (com-
pare Mark 1:8).


   "Christ has promised the gift of the Holy Spirit to His church, and the
promise belongs to us as much as to the first disciples. But like every
other promise, it is given on conditions."—The Desire of Ages, p. 672.

     Based on each of the quotes below, what are these conditions?

   1. "There are many who believe and profess to claim the Lord's
promise; they talk about Christ and about the Holy Spirit, yet receive no
benefit. They do not surrender the soul to be guided and controlled by
the divine agencies. . . . They want to manage themselves. This is why
they do not receive the heavenly gift."—The Desire of Ages, p. 672.

     Condition


   2. "There is no limit to the usefulness of the one who, putting self
aside, makes room for the working of the Holy Spirit upon his heart, and
lives a life wholly consecrated to God."—Christian Service, p. 254.

     Condition


    3. "The Holy Spirit will come to all who are begging for the bread of
life to give to their neighbors."—Christian Service, p. 252.

     Condition


   4. "It is our work, by confession, humiliation, repentance, and ear-
nest prayer, to fulfill the conditions upon which God has promised to
grant us His blessing. A revival need be expected only in answer to
prayer."—Selected Messages, book 1, p. 121.

     Condition

  Summarize a fifth condition for receiving the Holy Spirit.
Acts 5:32. How can you make sure that all five conditions are
present in your life?

FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT (Acts 4:23, 31; 6:1-5; 7:54-56; 11:22-
24; 13:9).

   What were Peter and the disciples able to do when they were filled
with the Holy Spirit? Acts 4:23, 31.


   No doubt Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit when he preached
as he did on Pentecost. It was a fulfillment of the Lord's promise
given in Matthew 10:19, 20: "Do not worry about how or what you
should speak. . . . It is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father
who speaks in you" (NKJV).
   Ephesians 5:18 commands all Christians to "be filled with the
Spirit." Being "filled with the Holy Spirit" is a special empowering of
the Holy Spirit over and above the ordinary. For lack of this special
empowering, one's testimony and spiritual life are weak.

   List others whom the book of Acts describes as being filled with
the Spirit. As a result, what were they able to do? Acts 6:1-5; 7:54-
56; 11:22-24; 13.9.

   TEXT            THOSE FILLED WITH             WHAT THEY WERE

   Acts 6:1-5


    kcts 7:54-56



   Acts 11:22-24



   Acts 13:9


    Consider the following prayerfully: "Morning by morning, as
 the heralds of the gospel kneel before the Lord and renew their
 vows of consecration to Him, He will grant them the presence of
 His Spirit, with its reviving, sanctifying power. As they go forth
 to the day's duties, they have the assurance that the unseen
 agency of the Holy Spirit enables them to be 'laborers together
 with God.' "—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 56.

                                                                        17

THE LATTER RAIN (Acts 2:14-21; Joel 2:23, 28-32).

   What did God promise to the church, according to Joel 2:23, 28-32?
Also read Acts 2:14-21.


   To consider Peter's use of Joel's prophecy correctly, we must
understand three points about it:
   1. The Holy Spirit helps all who receive Him to understand and
communicate God's will (Joel 2:28).
   2. The Holy Spirit is imparted to all who honestly desire Him regard-
less of age, gender, or class (vs. 28, 29).
   3. Salvation is available by calling "on the name of the Lord" (v. 32).

   Find verses in Acts 2 that tell how each of these points was
visible at Pentecost and write them on the lines below.




"When the Holy Spirit came upon the church, men's mouths were
opened to utter the word of the Lord; and the gift of this prophetic
proclamation fell upon persons old and young, upon the rich and the
poor, upon men and women. This event accompanied the beginning of
the new age, the day of the Messiah's reign, thus bringing to a close
the former ages and pointing on to the culmination of God's work in
history when Christ should overcome all his enemies."—George Arthur
Buttrick, commentary editor, The Interpreter's Bible, (Nashville, Tenn.:
Abingdon Press, 1956) vol. 6, p. 753.
   "The outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost was the
former rain, but the latter rain will be more abundant. The Spirit awaits
our demand and reception. Christ is again to be revealed in His fullness
by the Holy Spirit's power."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 121.
   The Holy Spirit's power is always manifested in action, and with the
power that the Holy Spirit brings, thousands of voices will proclaim the
final warning of the three angels' messages of Revelation 14:6-10.

    When "we have an enlightened people, that know by experi-
ence what it means to be laborers together with God"; when "the
largest portion of the church [become' laborers together with
God"; when "we have entire, wholehearted consecration to the
service of Christ, God will recognize the fact by an outpouring
of His Spirit without measure."—Christian Service, p. 253.
   Are you wholeheartedly consecrated "to the service of Christ"?
If not, why not? How can you begin to obtain such an experience?

FASTING (Acts 9:7-9, 18, 19; 13:1-3; 14:21-23).


   DEFINITION: Fasting is the intentional act of abstaining
   from food often for religious purposes. It is usually accompa-
   nied with Bible study, prayer, devotion, and meditation. "The
   principle behind fasting is that when conducted judiciously, it
   contributes to good health, and hence increases spiritual sen-
   sitivity."—SDA Encyclopedia, s. v. "Fasting."


   The digestion of food drains energy from the brain to the stomach.
Fasting for a short period of time, therefore, can assist the Holy Spirit
in helping our minds understand spiritual truths. It can be an impor-
tant companion to intercessory prayer for the church, for others, and
for one's self.
   Fasting is not necessary for receiving the power of God, but it is an
important spiritual exercise that God honors. Fasting with a pure heart
and for the right reasons may open doors that other keys have not been
able to open (Matt. 17:21).
   "For certain things, fasting and prayer are recommended and ap-
propriate. In the hand of God they are a means of cleansing the heart
and promoting a receptive frame of mind. We obtain answers to our
prayers because we humble our souls before God."—Counsels on Diet
and Foods, pp. 187, 188.
   Christ both upheld the discipline of fasting and foresaw that His
followers would do it (see Matt. 9:15; 17:21). However, fasting is not a
commandment.

   In what circumstances did the early Christians fast?

        TEXT                      REASON FOR FASTING
   Acts 9:7-9, 18, 19
   Acts 13:1-3

   Acts 14:21-23

   If, because of health reasons, it is unwise for you to fast from food,
you might consider "fasting" from something else, such as spending
time watching television or surfing the Internet.

    What would be important enough in your local church to
 inspire a time of fasting? Who should take the initiative to
 proclaim such a time? How will you plan to participate?

                                                                       19
Friday                                                         July 7
FURTHER STUDY: To learn more about the work of the Holy
Spirit, read the following verses: Gen. 1:2; Isa. 59:19; John 15:26;
16:13; Rom. 8:26, 27; 1 Cor. 2:13, 14.
   Also read any or all of the following: Christian Service, "The Holy
Spirit" pp. 250-256; The Acts of the Apostles, "Pentecost" and "The
Gift of the Spirit" pp. 35-56; Testimonies to Ministers, "Pray for the
Latter Rain" pp. 506-512.

   "Those only who are constantly receiving fresh supplies of grace,
will have power proportionate to their daily need and their ability to
use that power. Instead of looking forward to some future time when,
through a special endowment of spiritual power, they will receive a
miraculous fitting up for soul winning, they are yielding themselves
daily to God, that He may make them vessels meet for His use. . . . Daily
they are witnessing for the Master wherever they may be, whether in
some humble sphere of labor in the home, or in a public field of useful-
ness."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 55.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Why did early Christians see many "signs and wonders"? How
     is God manifesting His power today?

     2. "For the daily baptism of the Spirit every worker should offer
        his petition to God."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 50. What
        is meant by "the daily baptism of the Spirit"? Is it different
        from the "former rain"? Explain. What results may we
        expect from this baptism?

     3. How is Peter's life a good example of the Holy Spirit working in
        a person's life? Consider Peter's life before Pentecost (Matt.
        14:22-31; 16:21-23; John 18:1-11, 25-27) and the sermon
        itself.

SUMMARIZE this week's lesson by explaining in your own words the
following concepts: (1) being of one accord; (2) the relationship be-
tween fasting and the Holy Spirit; (3) conditions for receiving the Holy
Spirit; (4) being filled with the Holy Spirit; and (5) the former and the
latter rain of the Holy Spirit.

Ask
                       Andre's Accident
                          Andre Makong

   How can a 2-year-old child fall nearly 30 feet onto concrete and
not be injured? I am convinced that God protected my young
grandson, Andre Nathan, and used the accident to bring others to
know God.
   I was reading while my grandchildren, Andre and Jean, played
nearby. I did not notice Andre wander away from his sister. Nobody
saw him toddle upstairs or out onto the balcony. No one saw him
climb the railing or fall silently onto the pavement 30 feet below.
Only when I heard someone shouting outside did I realize that
something was wrong. I raced to the door and found a crowd
gathered around the boy. How could he have gotten outside? I
wondered. Then someone said he had fallen from the balcony
above. The boy was not crying and showed no signs of trauma or
injury as he looked at all the strange people around him.
   I rushed my grandson to the hospital where a doctor confirmed
that Andre had not been injured; he did not even have a scratch on
his body! Relieved, I returned home and contacted Andre's parents,
who were traveling, to assure them that the children were fine.
   That might have been the end of the ordeal. But word of the
child's miraculous escape from injury spread throughout the neigh-
borhood. One neighbor family came to see for themselves this child
whom God had protected. They told me, "The God who lives in this
house is not the same as the one who lives in our home." Others
made similar comments, for in Africa miracle events often gen-
erate faith responses.
   As a result of hearing about or witnessing Andre's escape from
death, two families are studying the Bible and a third is now attend-
ing church. The children of one family join us for family worship
                             when they hear us singing.
                                 As a grandfather I marvel at how God
                             saved my grandson's life, but as
                             a pastor, I marvel even more at how God
                              has used this incident to lead others to
                             Him.

                            is coordinator of Global Mission for the

  Participants in Witnessing




Sabbath Afternoon
THE PENTEL PEN, made in Japan, hit the market with only a minimal
amount of advertising. Within a year, sales in one country alone
soared to over 1.8 million dollars. Why? Word-of-mouth advertising.
Business people, office workers, doctors, housewives, and anyone
who used it advertised the pen by telling others about it.
   So it is with the gospel. Once it has made a difference in our lives, we will
always be looking for ways to tell others about it. Regardless of who we are
or what we do, if Jesus is our Lord and Savior, we are all, in a sense,
ministers. In New Testament times, believers accepted the privileges and
responsibilities related to witnessing. But "by the time of the Reformation
the biblical concept of the priesthood of all believers had been eroded by a
hierarchical and priest-centered church. Luther's reaffirmation of the prin-
ciple was a protest against clerical power."—Rex D. Edwards, Every
Believer a Minister (Nampa, Idaho: Pacific Presst, 1979), p. 82. As you
study this week's lesson, ask yourself, Has the gospel prospered because
of my desire to share it with others?

CLERGY AND LAY PEOPLE (Acts 26:2-16; 1 Pet. 2:9).

  Review Acts 26:2-16 to determine at what point in his life God called
Paul to minister for Him.


   The Greek word for "ministry" is diakonia, giving the concept of
"service" (see Acts 20:24; 21:19). Such ministry, or service, is the
responsibility of all believers while "pastors and teachers" are "for the
equipping of the saints for the work of ministry [service]" (Eph. 4:11,
12, NKJV).

   How does 1 Peter 2:9 describe this concept of service?


   The phrase "lay person" comes from the Greek word laos, meaning
"people." Unfortunately, the phrase has taken on some negative mean-
ings. It refers to a person who is not skilled in a certain profession. In
the church, the implication is that lay persons have secondary status.
   But it is not always easy to avoid this term. In many cases, the
phrase "church member" or "believer" could replace the phrase "lay
person."
   The word "clergy" comes from the Greek kleros, meaning "lot,"
"part," or "portion." Many consider ordained ministers as separate
from the "ordinary church members." They are thought of as that part
of the body of Christ ordained to function exclusively as ministers.
The term "clergy" suggests that a person belongs to that special
category, the kleros, to whom alone God has entrusted a special
portion of wisdom, power, and work.
   But the distinction between "lay people" and "clergy" is not bibli-
cal. The Protestant Reformation insisted on the "priesthood of all
believers." However, within this general ministry to which all believ-
ers are called, we recognize the particular service of deacons, elders,
and pastors, who assume their responsibilities by the laying on of
hands.

    "Ministers should not do the work which belongs to the church,
 thus wearying themselves, and preventing others from perform-
 ing their duty. They should teach the members how to labor in
 the church and in the community."—Christian Service, p. 69.

QUALIFICATIONS FOR MINISTRY (Acts 19:1-6; 2 Cor. 5:15-20).

  Explain the relationship that exists between the Holy Spirit and
our qualifications for service. Acts 19:1-6.


   What happened to this group of 12 Ephesians is similar to what
happened to the people gathered in the upper room (Acts 2:1-13). Just
as the people in Jerusalem were amazed by the power of God's Holy
Spirit, so were the people in Ephesus, where the goddess Artemis
(Diana) reigned supreme. This event planted some of the seed that
would help Ephesus become a center of Christianity for several hun-
dred years.
   "All to whom the heavenly inspiration has come are put in trust with
the gospel. All who receive the life of Christ are ordained to work for the
salvation of their fellow men. For this work the church was established,
and all who take upon themselves its sacred vows are thereby pledged to
be co-workers with Christ."—The Desire ofAges, p. 822.

   According to 2 Corinthians 5:15-20, what ministry is the responsi-
bility of all Christians?


   God's purpose for a congregation is not to have only one minister
with one hundred members supporting the minister's work. Instead,
God calls pastors and teachers "to prepare God's people for works of
service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach
unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become
mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ" (Eph.
4:12, 13, NIV). In this way, we all become ministers. The entire congrega-
tion, with their leader, should be active in worship and ministry.
   Church members will not be motivated to share the gospel if they
believe this is the responsibility of the "official ministry." God ex-
pects everyone to participate in the extension of His kingdom accord-
ing to the gifts assigned by the Holy Spirit.

   Recall the days immediately after you were baptized and "pledged
to be a co-worker with Christ." On a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being the
lowest, 10 the highest), how would you rate your experience now in
comparison to your "first love"? (Rev. 2:4). If you are lower on the
scale than you would like to be, what steps can you take to improve?

TRAINING FOR MINISTRY (Acts 19:8-10, 23-27).

   Paul offered some form of organized training in the school of
Tyrannus, at Ephesus. What was the impact of the training that
took place during two years? Acts 19:8-10, 23-27.


    In order to equip the believers for ministry, the Lord has appointed
local churches to be training centers. "Many would be willing to work
if they were taught how to begin. They need to be instructed and
encouraged. Every church should be a training school for Christian
workers."—Christian Service, p. 59.
    "Christian ministers . . . have a broader work than many have
recognized. They are not only to minister to the people, but to teach
them to minister. They should not only give instruction in right prin-
ciples, but educate their hearers to impart these principles. . . . Every
church member should be engaged in some line of service for the
Master."—The Ministry of Healing, pp. 148, 149.
    God told Paul to begin working for Him right away. Paul told those
with whom he worked to do likewise. However, the reality in many of
our churches is that "the members of the church, trained to rely upon
preaching, do little for Christ. They bear no fruit, but rather increase in
selfishness and unfaithfulness. They put their hope in the preacher and
depend upon his efforts to keep alive their weak faith."—Testimonies
for the Church, vol. 6, p. 434.
    "That the burden may be distributed, an education must be given to
the church by those who can teach the workers to follow Christ and to
work as He worked."—p. 435.

WORKING AS MEMBERS OF THE BODY (Acts 16:6-10; 18:22,
23).

     What motivated Paul to enter a new territory? Acts 16:6-10.


   The Greek word for "help" used in verse 9 means "to run to the cry
of those in danger." How were the people in Macedonia in danger?
   "From a more modern viewpoint the appeal may be given an even
wider interpretation by realizing that the man stands in Europe, and is
calling Paul to enter that great continent with the gospel message.
This is one of the crucial moments in history. Much of Europe's
future depends on Paul's response to the appeal."—SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 6, p. 327.
   Many people today around the world and across the street are longing
to have someone teach them about Christ. They are waiting for help to
come. "Instead of keeping the ministers at work for the churches that
already know the truth, let the members of the churches say to these
laborers: 'Go work for souls that are perishing in darkness. We ourselves
will carry forward the services of the church. We will keep up the
meetings, and, by abiding in Christ, will maintain spiritual life. We will
work for souls that are about us.'"—Christian Service, p. 171.
   "If the proper instruction were given, if the proper methods were
followed, every church member would do his work as a member of the
body. He would do Christian missionary work. But the churches are
dying, and they want a minister to preach unto them. . . . They should be
taught that unless they can stand alone, without a minister, they need
to be converted anew, and baptized anew."—Evangelism, p. 381.

  What did Paul do in Caesarea? In Antioch? In Galatia and
Phrygia? Acts 18:22, 23.


    In some parts of the world, the average pastor will have ten to
fifteen churches. Statistics show that in those areas where the ratio of
pastor to member is higher (for example, one pastor for 1,000 mem-
bers, in contrast to one pastor for 50 members), the church tends to
grow faster. This is not to suggest that churches should not have
pastors. Neither is it to suggest that the number of pastors in the field
should be reduced. It simply indicates that the more members are
involved in the work of the church, the more the church grows.

    How valid is the following reasoning: "I am giving my money so
 that the pastor will do the soul-winning and other 'ministerial duties"?
 Rewrite this to reflect the concepts we have been studying this week.

SPIRITUAL GIFTS (Acts 5:12; 9:36; 12:5; 13:1-3; 19:11, 12; 20:28;
21:8, 9).


   DEFINITION: Spiritual gifts are special abilities the Holy
   Spirit gives to church members to enable them to help the
   church fulfill its divine mission. We find the spiritual gifts
   listed in Romans 12:6-8; 1 Corinthians 12:4-11, 28-30; and
   Ephesians 4:7-12.


   The fact that there are many gifts suggests that each believer has an
individual ministry to perform, a specific witness to give. But even
though we receive our spiritual gifts on an individual basis, we all
should be skilled in witnessing about our faith, sharing our beliefs, and
sharing with others what God has done for us.

  What two spiritual gifts were especially manifested in Antioch?
Acts 13:1-3. Why were these gifts so important at this time in the
church's history?


   The prophets were preachers who traveled, sharing the gospel wher-
ever they went. The teachers remained in the local churches to instruct
converts. The list of men in verses 1-3 symbolizes the universality of
the gospel. Paul and Barnabas were Jewish. Lucius came from Cyrene in
North Africa. Simeon, also Jewish, was called by a Roman name, thus
indicating certain ties with the Romans. And finally there was Manaen,
who having been "brought up with Herod the tetrarch" (NIV), had
rather noble connections.

   What other spiritual gifts do the following passages from the book
of Acts suggest?

5:12                                   19:11

9:36                                   20:28

12:5


   What is the most obvious spiritual gift in your life, and how
 are you using it? Acts 13:2, 3 tells us that Saul and Barnabas
 were set aside for the work to which God had called them. What
 has God asked you to set aside for Him?

                                                                       '77

FURTHER STUDY: How do the following reflect the concept that
we are all in a sense ministers of the gospel? 2 Kings 5:1-3; Mark 6:1-
15; Luke 7:36-47; 21:1, 2. What other principles about witnessing can
you learn from these texts?
   Read the chapters in Ellen G. White's, Christian Service, "The
Church a Training Center" pp. 58-63; and "Co-operation of Ministers
and Laymen" pp. 67-71.

   "Every soul is to minister. He is to use every physical, moral and
mental power, through sanctification of the Spirit, that he may be a
laborer together with God. All are bound to devote themselves actively
and unreservedly to God's service. They are to cooperate with Jesus
Christ in the great work of helping others. Christ died for every man.
   "Ministry means not only the study of books and preaching. It
means service."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 4, p. 1159.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:

     tion of "ministry"? Which is correct, and why?

  (the congregation)               together with the pastor)

     2. List and discuss ways to involve newly baptized members in
        the "ministry of all believers."

     3. Describe some of the attitudes that keep people from actively
        participating in ministry. Now think about some of the attitudes
        that enable people to minister.

SUMMARIZE in your own words the following concepts from this
week's lesson: (1) Explain the difference between clergy and lay people
(Acts 26:16; 1 Pet. 2:9). (2) When do members become ministers?
(Acts 19:1-6). (3) Who should train church members for service?
(Acts 19:8-10). (4) How can we best work together as the body of
Christ? (Acts 16:6-10, 18-23). (5) Define spiritual gifts. State what
their purpose is and list specific ones. Having learned this week that
each one of us is a minister, what will you change about your life and
your relationships?

    "Many workers have not received their salary for months," Svetlana
Mukrukova reported during a Global Mission pioneer training pro-
gram in Russia. "Sometimes employers send some wood, a chicken, or
a dozen eggs as a token payment," she added. "But God has been so
good to us!"
    Svetlana's missionary partner, Galena Markova, is a nurse. She
testified that until recently she could arrange for a substitute to work
her Sabbath shifts. But this changed, and the administration began
demanding that she work her assigned shifts. Instead of compromising
her beliefs for the sake of a paycheck, she resigned from her job at the
hospital. When she learned about the Global Mission pioneer program,
she volunteered. Galena had made many friends among the patients
while she worked at the hospital. Therefore she and Svetlana will
return to this city to raise up a congregation there, starting with
Galena's former patients.
    Gradislava is a veteran Global Mission volunteer. She reported how
she and her husband had planted one church in 1997. "We went from
home to home selling books. Even though few have the money to buy,
I make friends with the people and tell them the wonderful messages
our books contain." On market days she displays her books on a small
table. Because of the economy, she does not sell many, but her table
attracts browsers who listen as she shares the gospel with them.
    Using these simple methods Gradislava has begun studying the
Bible with 20 persons and is nurturing friendships with another 30. She
reported that within six months she and her husband will see a second
church planted in their area.
    These volunteers do not enter the Global Mission pioneer program
 for the pay. Although Global Mission provides a small stipend for its
 pioneers, it barely covers the barest necessities. In the program in
which these women are part, the North Pacific Union Conference and
 The Quiet Hour send evangelistic teams to conduct harvest meetings
 and organize the new congregations that the pioneers have planted.
 Currently more than 200 lay persons are church planting in formerly
 unentered cities in the countries that make up the Euro-Asia Division.

  J. H. Zachary is coordinator of international evangelism for The
Quiet Hour and a special consultant for the General Conference
Ministerial Association.

              The Recipients of
                Witnessing




Sabbath Afternoon
WHEN WE GIVE OUR HEARTS TO GOD. Notice our memory
text for this week. Those of the Hebrew faith heard the first Christian
sermon (Acts 2:5, 14). Why do you think this was so?
   Then the gospel expanded to Samaria. As Jesus predicted (Matt.
16:17-19), Peter played a major role in opening the doors of the
kingdom to the Gentiles. Following God's directions, he entered a
Gentile's house, something unthinkable for a Jewish person (Acts
10:28). From there, the gospel was well on its way to " 'the ends of the
earth — (Acts 1:8, NIV).
   In St. Paul's Cathedral, General Gordon's epitaph reads as follows:
"He gave his strength to the weak, his substance to the poor, his
sympathy to the suffering, his heart to God." When we give our hearts
to God, we, too, will witness to many different types of people. As you
study this week's lesson, pray that God will show you to which end of
the earth He would like you to go, even if it is just around the corner or
down the hall!

CIVIL AUTHORITIES (Acts 4:1-7; 6:7; 13:6, 7).

   Before whom were Peter and John asked to testify? Acts 4:1-7.


   The question, "By what power or by what name have you done
this?" (v. 7) gave Peter a chance to testify to this group about the
power of Jesus (4:8-12). Surely he remembered that Jesus had said,
"You will be brought before kings and rulers for My name's sake. But
it will turn out for you as an occasion for testimony" (Luke 21:12, 13).

   Read each of the following passages. Why would the main charac-
ters in them have been considered among the "hard to reach"?

   Acts 6:7
   8:26-39

   13:6-12

   People in "worldly" positions of authority and leadership also need
the gospel. "It requires moral courage for them to take their position
for Christ. Special efforts should be made for these souls, who are in
so great danger, because of their responsibilities and associations."
—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 139, 140.
   "The intelligent, the refined, are altogether too much passed by. The
hook is not baited to catch this class, and ways and methods are not
prayerfully devised to reach them with truth that is able to make them wise
unto salvation. Most generally the fashionable, the wealthy, the proud,
understand by experience that happiness is not to be secured by the
amount of money that they possess, or by costly edifices, and ornamental
furniture and pictures. They want something they have not.. . . They need
Jesus, the light of righteousness."—Evangelism, p. 556.

   Philippians 4:22 suggests that the people in Caesar's household
who became Christians remained there to work. What harm might
have occurred if they had tried to leave? What might they have been
able to accomplish by staying?


     In Evangelism, page 255, Ellen G. White says that those in the upper
 socioeconomic classes "are attracted toward each other, and it is hard
 to find access to them." This being true, list certain methods of witness-
 ing to these classes that would be more appropriate than others. Why
 would these methods be more effective? How can your church, and
 you personally, become involved in some of these methods?

RECEPTIVE PEOPLE (Acts 10).

     How did Luke characterize Cornelius in Acts 10:1-35?


   The story in Acts 10 is remarkable because it is a story of crumbling
cultural barriers that kept the gospel from spreading.
   As a centurion in the Roman military, Cornelius would have been in
charge of 100 soldiers. Soldiers in the Italian Regiment were famous
for their spirit and courage. He was what people called a God-fearer—
a Gentile who was strongly attracted to the high moral and ethical
standards of the Hebrew faith and its belief in one God. God-fearers
worshiped Jehovah God and followed the Jewish law to the best of
their abilities but had not taken the more radical step of becoming
converts through circumcision. At that time, God-fearers were by far
the most receptive Gentiles to the gospel.

   According to Acts 10:30, Cornelius was fasting and praying. What
do you think Cornelius might have prayed?



   In following God's directions, Peter entered a Gentile's house, some-
thing unthinkable for a Hebrew (Acts 10:28). "The love of God,
sanctifying the soul, breaks down the wall of partition between the
customs and practices of different individuals and nations. The great
principles of Bible truth bring all into perfect harmony."—Ellen G.
White, Review and Herald, November 3, 1885, p. 559.
   "God-fearers" were good prospects. People like Cornelius should
be in our prospect files. All churches should have a prospect file.
People who have already had some contact with the church are usually
"Class A" prospects. "Class B" prospects are those related to mem-
bers, interests discovered by literature evangelists, people who have
already attended church services, evangelistic meetings, etc. "Class
C" prospects are people who may respond to your approaches. Ac-
cording to the Church Manual, 1995 edition, page 80, each church
should have an "Interest Coordinator," who is a member of the church
board. (See Seventh-day Adventist Church Manual [Hagerstown, Md.:
Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1995]).

   Why would God have chosen Cornelius to be among the first
notable converts from the Gentiles? What cultural barriers in your
part of the world need to come down for the gospel to spread? How is it
possible to eliminate these barriers without making enemies and in
such a way that people will still be attracted to the gospel? Explain.

CHILDREN (Mark 10:13-16; Prov. 22:6).

   What does Jesus' reaction to the disciples in Mark 10:13-16 tell us
about the importance of witnessing to children? What was it about
Jesus that made parents want to bring their children to Him?


   Based on the matters over which He displayed displeasure, we know
what mattered to Jesus the most. He never became angry when people
were personally abusing Him—not even when He was exposed to the
cruelest of capital punishments. But when the flames of injustice licked
around the feet of the most vulnerable members of society, He was swift
to make His feelings known.
   The disciples attempted to keep the children away from Jesus. How
do we do so today? We may hinder the children when we fail to take
positive action regarding any given situation they are in or by setting a
bad example. Children need to feel important and loved. But when other
interests concern us more than their welfare, we are keeping them from
Jesus. We also hinder them from knowing Jesus when we neglect their
religious training.

  Why is it important to educate children in the ways of God?
Prov. 22:6.


   "In the way- he should go. Literally . . . 'according to his [the
child's] way.' The verse . . . counsels parents to learn the way in which
their particular child can be expected to be of most service to himself
and others, and in which he will find most happiness."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1020.
   The family and the church have a great responsibility toward chil-
dren. "The lessons that the child learns during the first seven years of
life have more to do with forming character than all that it learns in
future years."—Child Guidance, p. 193.
    Many studies in the field of character and moral development have
verified the above quote. Researchers Robert Peck and Robert Havighurst,
along with their co-workers, collected data over a period of seven
years. Two of their general findings maintain that the home is the most
important influence on moral development and that character is largely
developed by the age of 10, if not before.

    What could be improved in your church regarding the evan-
 gelization of children? List at least three children you know
 personally. How can you help lead them to Christ?

INTELLECTUALS (Acts 17:16-34).

    During Paul's time, Athens was a great university town. In addition,
it boasted many statues to false gods. While there, Paul, as always,
witnessed to the Hebrew people. He also went daily to the marketplace
seeking for an opportunity to testify (Acts 17:17). Among those who
met and talked with Paul were the Epicureans and the Stoics (v. 18),
representatives of two popular philosophies. The Epicureans believed
that the highest "pleasure" in life was to obtain freedom from supersti-
tion and pain. The Stoics believed that thinking was more important
than feeling. A very disciplined group of people, they attempted to
restrict, in rather harsh ways, their desires for pleasure.

  How did Paul address these intellectuals so they would appreciate
and understand his message? What six points did his sermon
make? Acts 17:22-31.

     1.                            4.


     2.                            5.


     3.                            6.

   Witnessing to these trained thinkers was not easy. A basic assump-
tion of Greek philosophy was that humans could find truth in them-
selves, so revelation from outside a person was unnecessary. Follow-
ing a sound principle of witnessing, Paul preached to the Athenians in
terms they could understand. That he showed an understanding of
Stoic ideas (v. 28) is not to say that he accepted these ideas. He was
communicating in a language meaningful in their culture.

     What were the results of this sermon? Verses 32-34.


   "In their pride of intellect and human wisdom may be found the
reason why the gospel message met with comparatively little success
among the Athenians. The worldly-wise men who come to Christ as
poor lost sinners, will become wise unto salvation; but those who come
as distinguished men, extolling their own wisdom, will fail of receiving
the light and knowledge that He alone can give."—The Acts of the
Apostles, p. 240.

     How can you personally witness to an educated person you know?

ANIMISTS AND NON-CHRISTIANS (Acts 8:9-19; 19:18-20).



      DEFINITION: Animism is the belief that life is produced
      by a spiritual force apart from matter. It promotes the
      role of ghosts, nature gods, and ancestral spirits. Animists
      do not deny God. But they see God permeating all natural
      phenomena.


     How did Simon seek to manipulate God's power? Acts 8:9-19.


   A true Christian approaches God in an attitude of submission and
worship. Christians demonstrate that a transformation has taken place
by accepting the lordship of Jesus Christ, by being willing to obey the
creator God, and by developing a personal relationship with Him.
   The Bible recognizes the reality and power of Satan and demons
(Acts 19:14-16). But those who trust in the Lord should not be afraid
of their power (James 4:7; Rom. 8:38, 39; Eph. 6:10-13; 1 John 3:8).
   The Bible clearly forbids such related practices as witchcraft, magic,
divination, astrology, and communication with spirits (Lev. 19:31; 20:27;
Deut. 4:19; 18:10-13; Isa. 8:19, 20; 47:13-15; Jer. 10:2).

  Through what public act did the Ephesians demonstrate that they
were cutting their ties with the forces of evil? Acts 19:18-20.


   Proclaiming the gospel to non-Christians can be difficult, as the
apostles discovered (Acts 14:11-18; 19:23-28). But Christians can
confront non-Christian beliefs with the truth of the gospel by demon-
strating in their own lives the transforming power of the true God.

   List at least three people you know who are non-Christians.
 Then think of how you can witness on an individual basis to each
 one. Take into account each person s needs, desires, and interests.

FURTHER STUDY: Review Matthew 28:16-20, Acts 16:6-10, and
Acts 10. Explain how these texts are related.
   Read any or all of the following: The Acts of the Apostles, "A Seeker
for Truth" pp. 131-142; "Berea and Athens" pp. 231-242; "Preaching
Among the Heathen" pp. 177-187; Evangelism, "Laboring for Special
Classes" pp. 552-588; Child Guidance, "Arousing the Spiritual
Powers" pp. 471-502; "Laboring for Special Classes" pp. 552-554.

   "Jesus saw in every soul one to whom must be given the call to His
kingdom. He reached the hearts of the people by going among them as one
who desired their good. He sought them in the public streets, in private
houses, on the boats, in the synagogue, by the shores of the lake, and at
the marriage feast. He met them at their daily vocations, and manifested an
interest in their secular affairs."—Christian Service, p. 119.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Bar-Jesus was a sorcerer (Acts 13:6). What modern terms
     could we use to describe him today? How is such activity ex-
     pressing itself in your part of the world?

     2. Paul and Silas suffered much as a result of the encounter with
        the spirit in Philippi (Acts 16:16-24). Why? What do you
        find most notable about Paul and Silas's reaction? How can
        their reaction encourage you today?

     3. Paul generally preached first in the synagogue when he evan-
        gelized a new city such as Corinth. Why was this a good
        strategy?

     4. In this week's lesson, we studied five different groups to whom
        we need to witness. Name other groups that are especially
        prominent in your part of the world. What are their special
        characteristics and needs? Based on these, think of ways to
        witness to them that would be most effective.

SUMMARIZE how you would witness to the following types of people:
(1) civil authorities (Acts 4:1-6; 6:7; 13:6, 7); (2) receptive people (Acts
10); (3) children (Mark 10:13-16; Prov. 22:6); (4) intellectuals (Acts
17:16-34); (5) animists and non-Christians (Acts 8:9-11, 18, 19; 19:18-20).
   Consider your own range of influence. To which of these groups do
you think you could be the most helpful? Why? Plan how you can start
actively witnessing to someone.

                  A Shepherd and a Hymnal
                            Chen Zhe Shen

   The Miao people live as farmers and shepherds in the mountains of
southwest China.
   Pan often entertained himself by singing as he tended his sheep.
One day as he walked the mountain path toward the city, he passed a
building and heard singing. He stopped to listen, and someone invited
him in. The building was an Adventist church.
   Someone gave Pan a hymnal, and that gift changed his life. Pan
taught himself to read so he could learn the hymns. When he found a
word he didn't know he circled it and later asked someone what the
word meant. Pan literally sang himself into the Adventist Church.
   One day Pan was so engrossed in a gospel tract that he forgot about
the sheep. When he looked up the sheep were gone! Pan began
searching for the sheep. The sky grew dark with rain clouds, and still
Pan had not found the sheep. How could I let my sheep wander away?
he chastened himself.
   Then Pan remembered that God knows everything. He knelt and
prayed, "Lord, have mercy on me. Help me find my sheep." When he
opened his eyes the dark clouds had gone and he was surrounded by
his flock of sheep. Not one was missing! Pan returned to the village
and eagerly told others what had happened.
   Pan's faith in God grew, and he was baptized. He loved to share his
faith with others, and the Adventist church encouraged him to study
theology and become a pastor. But Pan ran into difficulties at the
government-operated seminary. Students teased him about worshiping
on the Sabbath and refusing to eat pork. Teachers often gave tests on
Sabbath, and Pan's Sabbath absences from class eventually led to his
dismissal. But God provided a way for him to continue attending
classes. He never received a diploma for his work at the seminary, but
Pan knew that Jesus' disciples had no diplomas either.
    Pan returned to his mountain home and started preaching. He
established many house churches among the Miao villages. Hundreds
have been baptized because of his witness. Attendance at Adventist
churches in his village has grown to more than 1,200. Some believers
 must leave their homes in neighboring villages at 4:00 a.m. to arrive at
church by 8:00.
    God has a million ways to reach the hearts of searching souls. For
 Pan it was a love for music and a church hymnal that led him to Christ.

Mission.

         The Action Words of
             Witnessing




Sabbath Afternoon
TAKE YOUR MARKS! GET SET! GO! We often hear these words at
the beginning of a race, just before the runners begin to compete for
the medals. The sleek muscles of the athletes seem to vibrate with
expectation and action—witnessing as they do to years of training.
   As Christians, we, too, run a race, full of action and expectation
(1 Cor. 9:24-27). And as we do, we demonstrate our commitment
to Jesus within the power of the Holy Spirit.
   Action words are verbs that transmit the idea of life, energy, move-
ment, and purpose. Space and time do not permit us to study within the
confines of these pages all the action words that pertain to witnessing.
The Christian witness should arise, go, move, give, proceed, travel,
walk, depart, heal, feed, etc. "The disciples were to work earnestly for
souls, giving to all the invitation of mercy. They were not to wait for the
people to come to them; they were to go to the people with their
message."—Christian Service, p. 23.
   Like the runners in a race, we, too, have received our instructions: "Go
ye therefore." What are you waiting for? Take your mark! Get set! Go!

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE:
  I. Testify! (Acts 5:32; 18:5, 9; John 15:26, 27).
 11. Teach! (Acts 8:1-4; 20:20).
I11. Prove! (Acts 17:2, 3).
IV. Proclaim! (Acts 8:4-8; 5:42; 15:35).
 V. Persuade! (Acts 28:23, 24; 14:20-22).

MEMORY TEXT: "For we cannot but speak the things which we
have seen and heard" (Acts 4:20).

TESTIFY! (Acts 5:32; 18:5, 9; John 15:26, 27).

   What action words regarding witnessing can you find in the follow-
ing verses?

  John 15:26, 27


   Acts 18:5


   Acts 18:9


   It is natural for a person to talk. But to speak suggests talking to
communicate a message. Disciples "cannot but speak the things" which
they have seen and heard in such a way that many will believe (Acts
4:20; 14:1). Because we are surrounded by many different people each
day, we should learn how to start a conversation. Usually it is easy to
smile and say, "Good morning," adding a few words and giving your
name. If you have a newspaper, for instance, you can ask, "Did you
read the paper this morning?" A conversation may develop on the
signs of the times and the return of Jesus as the solution. You may then
have the opportunity to give your testimony about how knowing Jesus
has helped you.
   The verbs witness and testify are intimately related. To testify means
"to declare emphatically about some truth," "to make a serious declara-
tion to substantiate a fact." To witness means "to serve as an evidence
of a fact." The apostles gave "witness of the resurrection of the Lord
Jesus" (Acts 4:33). And Jesus asked His disciples to be His witnesses
(1:8).
    When Peter told the people to repent (Acts 2:38), he had himself
repented of his own lying, denial, and profanity (Matt. 26:69-75). So he
witnessed both to the necessity of repentance and to the power of God
to transform the repentant one. That is why he could declare, "We are
his witnesses of these things" (Acts 5:32). Experience lies at the
foundation of all true, effective witnessing.

    "No man has any right to recommend to others what he has not
 himself tasted and tested. Some people need something to tell more
 than they need power to tell it. Too often we preach of things in
 which we have no personal experience. I earnestly ask: What have
 you to tell that makes you so eager for God to give you power to tell
 it?"—Froom, The Coming of the Comforter, pp. 104, 105.


                                                                      39

TEACH! (Acts 8:1-4; 20:20).

  What did the scattered ones do as they fled from Jerusalem?
Acts 8:1-4.


   These were "ordinary" Christians—"men and women who had
learned to love their Lord, and who had determined to follow His
example of unselfish service. To these lowly ones, as well as to the
disciples who had been with the Savior during His earthly ministry, had
been given a precious trust. They were to carry to the world the glad
tidings of salvation through Christ.
    "When they were scattered by persecution they went forth with
missionary zeal... . They knew they held in their hands the bread of life
for a famishing world; and they were constrained by the love of Christ
to break this bread to all who were in need."—The Acts of the Apostles,
pp. 105, 106.

  What two approaches to teaching did Paul use in Ephesus? Acts
20:20.


   Thirty times, the gospels refer to Jesus as a teacher. From the early
days of Acts (Acts 5:21, 25) to the last verse of the book (28:31),
teaching was an essential part of Christian ministry. We are instructed
that "there should be less preaching, and more teaching."—Gospel
Workers, p. 407. One of the modern approaches to witnessing through
teaching is a seminar—or specialized class. Many universities and
colleges offer seminars as do businesses who want to give their em-
ployees further training in a specialized area. In a seminar, there are
no preliminaries such as a song service, special music, or the collec-
tion of offerings. They are conducted largely by local pastors and
church members rather than by professional evangelists. A seminar
often offers a great deal of interaction between the teacher and the
class. Prophecy, lifestyle, and family life are common seminar topics.
   "Every message we teach . . . ends up with the Man of Galilee, the
Lamb of God, the resurrected Savior, the infilling Lord. What Christ
said, what He did, and what He does are all part of preaching Jesus
Christ."—Lloyd Ogilvie, Acts: The Communicator's Commentary Se-
ries (Waco, Texas: Word, Inc., 1983), vol. 5, p. 152.

   Why do you think teaching often can be more effective than
 preaching? What are the special needs of your community?
 How could those needs be addressed in a seminar?

PROVE! (Acts 17:2, 3).

   What approach to witnessing did Paul follow? Acts 17:2, 3.


   To reason is to think in a logical way, to form judgments, and to draw
conclusions from facts. The word used in the original language suggests
the method of questions and answers. Dialogue is related to it. According
to Acts 17:2, 3, reasoning involves explaining and demonstrating, " 'as if
one, having broken the rind, were to disclose and exhibit the kernel."'
—Marvin R. Vincent, Word Studies in the New Testament (McLean,
Va.: MacDonald Publishing Company, 1888), vol. 1, p. 536.
   Reasoning also involves answering objections. "Many a laborer fails
in his work because he does not come close to those who most need his
help. With the Bible in hand, he should seek in a courteous manner to
learn the objections which exist in the minds of those who are beginning
to enquire, 'What is truth?'"—Gospel Workers, p. 190.
   An objection is an honest block to a decision. An excuse is an attempt
to avoid making a decision. You can know whether the people with
whom you are studying have a sincere objection by asking them whether
that objection is the only reason they have for not committing their life to
Jesus. Get a decision from the prospects based on the reasoning that if the
objection could be removed they would make a commitment immedi-
ately. Then answer the objection and ask for a decision.

   Which of the following examples from the book of Acts would
help to answer the objection "I cannot decide now because every-
thing is happening so fast"? Acts 2:41; 9:36; 16:25-34; 22:16.


   Related to the word reason is the word prove. Read Acts 9:17-22.
Because Paul's proofs were convincing and overwhelming, some of the
people attempted to kill him (9:29). That Paul would attempt to prove the
gospel to synagogues full of his fellow Hebrews is "an act of the
greatest moral courage. It was to these very synagogues that Paul had
received his letters of credit as an official agent of the Jewish faith and
of the Sanhedrin. It would have been very much easier to begin his
Christian witness somewhere where he was not known and where his
past did not stand against him. Paul is saying, 'I am a changed man and
I am determined that those who know me best should know it.' Already
he is proclaiming, 'I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ.' "
—William Barclay, The Acts of the Apostles, rev. ed. (Philadelphia:
Westminster Press, 1976), p. 73.

   Where is there room for emotions in our witnessing?

                                                                         41
Wednesday                                                   July 26
PROCLAIM! (Acts 8:4-8; 5:42; 15:35).

   The word "announce" means "to call the gospel to people's atten-
tion." It is close in meaning to the terms "to preach" and "to pro-
claim," so it is translated as such in many passages (see Acts 4:2; 13:5;
17:3; 26:23).

   What did Philip preach in Samaria? What did his message do for
the people who accepted his message? Acts 8:4-8.


    The purpose of preaching is not to demonstrate or to prove a truth.
"We need far less controversy, and far more presentation of Christ. Our
Redeemer is the center of all our faith and hope. Those who can mirror
His matchless love, and inspire hearts to give Him their best and holiest
affections, are doing work that is great and holy. . . . The many
argumentative sermons preached seldom soften and subdue the soul."
—Evangelism, p. 172.
    The biblical term for preaching means to announce an event, a fact,
a truth, and to proclaim it with the authority of a herald.
    The early Christians proclaimed that the Messiah had come (Acts
9:20). They announced the good news that in Jesus there was room in
God's kingdom for a repentant heart (13:38). They exhorted people to
accept their message (2:40). Even today, "no discourse should ever be
preached without presenting Christ and Him crucified as the foundation
of the gospel."—Gospel Workers, p. 158. This kind of preaching will
"touch invisible chords, whose vibrations will ring to the ends of the
earth, and make melody through eternal ages."—The Desire of Ages,
p. 823. Sermons promoting specific programs within the church do not
convert people. But preaching Christ will always win many to Him.

   What two witnessing functions are often found together? Acts
5:42; 15:35 (compare Eph. 4:11, 12).


   "Both teaching and preaching had to be done to set forth Jesus as
the Saviour, and to instruct in the way of life for God; doubtless this
was especially essential for Gentiles, who, it was becoming clear, were
now partakers of the new covenant under the gospel."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 6, p. 315.

   Even though "announcing" in the book of Acts usually refers
to "preaching," what other forms of announcing may be used in
witnessing?

PERSUADE! (Acts 28:23, 24; 14:20-22).

   How did Paul work toward getting people in Rome to make a deci-
sion for Jesus? With what results? Acts 28:23, 24.


    Persuasion means "to bring another person to a point of view."
According to the divine principles of free will, we cannot coerce people.
But we can help them by:
    1. providing all necessary information,
    2. answering their objections,
    3. making their options clear,
   4. inviting them to side with biblical truth,
    5. affirming them as they make the right decisions, and
    6. inviting them to open their lives to the convicting power of the
Holy Spirit.
    The specific purposes of evangelism are to persuade people to:
    1. accept Jesus and His truth, and
    2. serve Him in the fellowship of the church.
    These two objectives are intimately related. You cannot have one
without the other.
    One way of helping people make a positive decision concerning a
point of doctrine is by asking three leading questions:
    1."Is this subject clear to you?" (generally they will say "Yes").
    2. "Do you have any question related to this subject?" (Answer their
questions. Then ask the first two leading questions again until they
have no more questions).
    3. Finally ask, "Do you really believe in this subject?" (Will you act upon
it? Some useful texts at this point are Acts 22:16; Matt. 9:9; Isa. 1:18).

   After accomplishing what two purposes did the apostles leave Derbe?
Acts 14:20-22. How important is the second purpose to the health of
the individual member and the church at large?


   Evangelism should not end with a person's decision to follow Jesus.
Neither is baptism the conclusion of the process. True success in
evangelism is related to the involvement of new members in church life
and their continued spiritual growth.

    How can we help new believers "to continue in the grace of God"?
 What responsibilities are appropriate to assign to a newly baptized
 member? Why are they appropriate? Which responsibilities might
 not be appropriate, and why? Explain how the appropriateness of a
 specific activity might vary from church to church.

FURTHER STUDY: Read Matthew 25:31-46. List the action words
in this parable that relate to witnessing. Then list at least four things
this parable teaches you about witnessing. Or look up some of the
following action words in a concordance. Which verses do you find
with these words in them that relate to witnessing? What do these
verses teach you about witnessing? The words are arise, go, move,
heal, feed, confess, praise.
   Read any or all of the following: Christian Service, "Witnesses" pp.
15-17; "The Divine Commission" pp. 22-24; and "Profession vs. Ex-
pression" pp. 94-98; The Acts of the Apostles, "The Great Commission"
pp. 25-34; The Desire of Ages, "Go Teach All Nations" pp. 818-828.

   "God does not generally work miracles to advance His truth. .. . [He]
works according to great principles . . . and it is our part to mature
wise plans, and set in operation the means whereby God shall bring
about certain results."—Evangelism, pp. 652, 653.
   "As His representatives among men, Christ does not choose angels
who have never fallen, but human beings. . . . Divinity needed human-
ity; for it required both the divine and the human to bring salvation to
the world. . . . Humanity lays hold upon divine power, Christ dwells in
the heart by faith; and through co-operation with the divine, the power
of man becomes efficient for good."—The Desire ofAges, pp. 296, 297.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What other action words can you add to this study? How do they
     relate to the Great Commission? Should all ministries in the
     church relate to the Great Commission? Explain your answer.

     2. Explain the role we have in the salvation of souls. In what
        ways are we responsible for the results of our witnessing
        endeavors? What ways and means might help you the most,
        and why?

     3. A church worker receives a salary for the witnessing he or she
        does. Is this person's work really then considered witnessing?
        Explain. Is this all the witnessing this person should do? Again,
        explain your answer.

     4. Should we witness only to unbelievers? Explain your answer.

SUMMARIZE this week's lesson by listing and explaining the active
ways we can witness to unbelievers. How do we continue to witness to

most interesting to you? How will it help you to become a better

                Singer's Search for a Saviour
                             J. H. Zachary

   Ulzhan Omarbekova [OOL-zhan oh-MAR-beh-ova] is a famous
musician in her native Kazakhstan. But her success as a singer could
not fill the emptiness in her life. She recognized that forces of good
and evil existed in the world, but she did not know what their existence
meant for her. She read books on various religious philosophies, but
was disappointed when they did not point her toward Allah, or God.
She began studying the Qu'ran and the Bible, but she found the
Qur'an too difficult to understand.
    Then while browsing a bookstore, she found The Acts of the
Apostles and Steps to Christ. In these books she found answers to her
deepest questions. She accepted their teachings and began searching
for a church that followed the principles taught in these books. She
visited several religious meetings, but was disappointed. Finally she
started her own small group.
    Then she met Victor, a literature evangelist, who shared his faith
with her and made the Bible seem easy to understand. But she politely
refused his invitations to attend religious meetings. "I do not trust
religious teachers," she answered. "They have disappointed me."
    Victor invited her to watch video Bible studies, and Ulzhan agreed.
She was delighted with the videos, and after viewing several, she and her
friends decided to visit the church with Victor. Ulzhan was so thrilled
with the church members' friendliness that she offered to sing for the
service. But the cautious pastor told her that she would have to be a
member before she could sing. Rather than being put off, Ulzhan and two
of her friends joined the baptismal class. She was baptized in 1996.
    However, her road to faith was not smooth. When she became a
Christian, her husband left her. Nevertheless, she rejoices in the peace
and joy she has found in Jesus. "Jesus is everything to me," she says.
"I don't know how I existed without Him."
    Ulzhan now is the speaker for Adventist World Radio's Kazak-
                           language programs, where her talents in mu-
                           sic and drama draw listeners as she explains
                           the Qu'ran in the light of the Bible. Her
                           ministry is touching many lives in the Islamic
                           community.

                          evangelism for The Quiet Hour and a special

       Models for Witnessing




Sabbath Afternoon
MODELS FOR WITNESSING ABOUND EVERYWHERE. A
woman in mainland China leads hundreds of house churches.
A dentist in the Philippines establishes more than fifty churches. A
church in Texas provides services for deaf people. And a family
leaves their country to work among a nonentered people group.
   The list of modern witnessing "heroes" is endless. But they all have
one thing in common. They serve as witnesses according to their own
spiritual gifts, natural talents, and opportunities God places before
them, all with a good measure of creativity.
   Of course, Jesus is the ultimate example of what it is to witness. The
commitment to witnessing manifested by early Christians is also an
example for those of us living in the time of the end. It is easy to think
that a champion like Paul is a model for witnessing. But what about a
deacon? Or a refugee couple from Rome? As we study the book of Acts,
we find dynamic models for witnessing that we can follow.
   The models for witnessing we will consider this week do not exhaust
biblical patterns. But they may inspire us to search for new models.

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE:
  I. Stephen—Faithful Unto Death (Acts 6:5, 6, 8-15; 7:57-60).
 11. The Scattered Ones—Sharing Wherever They Went (Acts
     8:1-5; 11:19-21).
I11. Philip—the Evangelist (Acts 8:5, 26, 40; 21:8, 9).
IV. Mark—Helpful in Ministry (Acts 12:25; 13:5, 13; 15:37-39).
 V. Aquila and Priscilla—Always Hospitable (Acts 18:1-3, 24-26).

MEMORY TEXT: "For he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit
and of faith. And a great many people were added to the Lord"
(Acts 11:24, NKJV).

STEPHEN—FAITHFUL UNTO DEATH (Acts 6:5, 6, 8-15; 7:57-
60).

   What words do Acts 6:5, 8 use to describe Stephen?


   We do not know exactly what Stephen was doing when the church
chose him to be one of the seven deacons. But based on the description
of him in Acts 6, we may safely assume that, personally, he had been
doing what a person needs to do to sustain a healthy relationship with
Christ.
   Later, a dispute with Stephen led those who "were not able to resist
the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke" to lie against him, to
cause further tensions, and finally to kill him (Acts 6:9-12; 7:58). Wit-
nessing can be a risky business.

  Analyze Stephen's prayer in Acts 7:59, 60. What major aspect of
Christianity did Stephen's last words reflect? Explain how Stephen's
prayer was perhaps the best witness he ever gave.


   "The prayer for himself was not a request for deliverance, but an
affirmation of trust. Though it is in the form of a petition, it is not
difficult to see that the petition rests upon a profound trust in Jesus.
Not 'Lord, save my life,' but 'Lord, receive my spirit.' It is a prayer that
looks forward, not backward. There is no fear in it, only faith. It assumes
that whatever happens, Jesus will be there and that he will be adequate
to any emergency. . . .
   "All he asked was that Jesus should keep his spirit, that through his
present trial Jesus should steady him. . . ."—The Interpreter's Bible,
vol. 9, p. 105.
   Such prayers do not come easily. They represent a life of sacrifice
and service, a life of dedication and commitment. We cannot think to be
a martyr for Christ in death if we will not be a martyr for Him in life.
    When Luke wrote the book of Acts, the persecution that began with
Stephen's death had ended. The church, however, was soon to be
confronted with another period of persecution. Persecution was re-
garded as a challenge, an opportunity to witness. Tertullian, a Christian
living during that later persecution, affirmed that "the blood of Chris-
tians is [the] seed" of the church (Apology, chap. 50, p. 55).

    Review the qualifications required by the apostles for church
 officers (Acts 6:3). Which of them is more important for witnes-
 sing? Why? How can a person fulfill that condition? How can
 you model certain aspects of Stephen's witness?

                                                                         47

THE SCATTERED ONES—SHARING WHEREVER THEY WENT
(Acts 8:1-5; 11:19-21).

   After Stephen's murder, persecution broke out, and the Christians
were forced to flee Jerusalem. Read Acts 8:1-5 and 11:19-21. If your
Bible has a set of good maps, determine how far they fled. Then list
three ways in which the witnessing of these people serves as a model
for us.

   Antioch was the greatest city of Asia, made so in part by its position
on the Orontes River approximately 15 miles (24 km) from the Medi-
terranean Sea. It was the headquarters of the Roman prefect of Syria
and a large community of Jewish people for whom Herod the Great
constructed a marble colonnade running the length of the city. It also
boasted of chariot races and its worship of the goddess Daphne, whose
temple reigned in the beautiful laurel groves five miles from town. That
a great number of people in Antioch accepted Christ is a testimonial to
the witnessing skills of the scattered Christians who settled there.
   "When they were scattered by persecution they went forth filled
with missionary zeal. They realized the responsibility of their mission.
They knew that they held in their hands the bread of life for a famishing
world; and they were constrained by the love of Christ to break this
bread to all who were in need."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 106.
   Persecution has always aroused the church for witnessing. Where
peace and comfort prevail, it seems that the church easily develops a
false sense of security that does not motivate believers to pray and to
witness with a sense of urgency.

   Why wait for persecution to force you into witnessing? If you
are not witnessing now, do you think you will do so when perse-
cution rears its ugly head? If Christians are not now being
persecuted in your part of the world, how does the story of the
scattered ones inspire you to witness now, during relative peace?
If Christians where you live are suffering for their faith, how
can this story strengthen you to continue witnessing for Christ?

PHILIP—THE EVANGELIST (Acts 8:5, 26, 40; 21:8, 9).

    The deacons were to care for the material needs of the growing
church so the apostles could give themselves totally to the ministry of
the Word (Acts 6:4). However, Scripture mentions that some of the
deacons also were active in gospel ministry. Stephen "did great won-
ders and miracles among the people" (6:8; 6:10; 7:2-56), and Philip
preached, performed miracles, and baptized.
    This Philip was not an apostle but one of the seven deacons ap-
pointed along with Stephen (8:1, 4, 5). In commenting on his example,
let us consider Revelation 22:17: "The Spirit and the bride say, Come.
And let him that heareth say, Come." "The charge to give this invita-
tion includes the entire church. Every one who has heard the invitation
is to echo the message from hill and valley, saying 'Come.' It is a fatal
mistake to suppose that the work of soul-saving depends alone upon
the ministry. . .. Why is it that many more do not respond to the call? Is
it because they think themselves excused in that they do not stand in
the pulpit? Let them understand that there is a large work to be done
outside the pulpit, by thousands of consecrated lay members."—The
Acts of the Apostles, pp. 110, 111.

   To what three cities did Philip go in his attempts to obey the gospel
commission? Acts 8:5, 26, 40. What does his willingness to do so tell
us about him?


   Israel was composed of three main regions—Galilee to the north,
Samaria in the middle, and Judea in the south. Samaria, the city, in the
region of Samaria, had been the capital of the northern kingdom of
Israel. In 722 B.C., Assyria defeated the northern kingdom, killed many
of the Jewish people, and carried others off to Assyria. Those who
remained married those who helped to repopulate the area. Their
children are the Samaritans we read about in the Bible. When the Jews
returned to Samaria after the exile ended, a deep prejudice festered
between them and these offspring. Yet despite such hatred, Jesus
witnessed to them, as did Philip.

   How were Philip and his family known in the church? Acts 21:8, 9.


    How can deacons, elders, and deaconesses participate in mis-
 sionary activities? How can professors, carpenters, nurses, stu-
 dents, secretaries, farmers, children, mechanics, etc., partici-
 pate in the work of saving souls? How can you become involved
 in a specific evangelistic project in your community?

                                                                       49
Wednesday                                                 August 2
MARK—HELPFUL IN MINISTRY (Acts 12:25; 13:5, 13; 15:37-
39).

   Acts 11 ends by saying that Barnabas and Saul went from Antioch
to Jerusalem, taking relief funds for the church there. Acts 12 is like
parentheses. It could have started off, "Meanwhile, in Jerusalem . . ."
then proceeded with the story of Peter's deliverance from prison. The
end of the chapter closes the parentheses, declaring that "Barnabas
and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their minis-
try" (12:25). There John Mark joined them to be their helper (Acts
12:25; 13:5). Because Mark's mother frequently opened her home to
the apostles, he would already have spent much time with many of the
well-known people of the early church.

  What happened with John Mark in Perga? Acts 13:13. What did
Barnabas propose at a later date? Acts 15:37-39.


   "This desertion caused Paul to judge Mark unfavorably, and even
severely, for a time. Barnabas, on the other hand, was inclined to excuse
him because of his inexperience. He felt anxious that Mark should not
abandon the ministry ."—Conflict and Courge, p. 348.
   Scripture offers no concrete explanation concerning why Mark
returned to Jerusalem. But Acts 13:14 perhaps gives us a clue. The
road to Pisidian Antioch was located on a plateau 3,600 feet (1,080
meters) above sea level. The only road there was a difficult passage
through the Taurus mountains. And if that wasn't bad enough, the
route was haunted by criminals. Perhaps the knowledge that this
would be the next part of their journey convinced John Mark to return
home. (Read The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 169, 170.)

  Read what Colossians 4:10; 2 Timothy 4:11; and Philemon 23,
24 have to say about John Mark. What conclusions about his
experience can we draw from this information?


   Perhaps John Mark's most important contribution to the church was
the writing of the gospel named after him. There may be several John
Marks in our churches who could become church leaders if they were
given a chance to serve.

   Are you ever tempted to quit doing something that you started for
the Lord when it gets to be too difficult? Have you ever been afraid of
continuing a project that you started for Him? How can John Mark
serve as a model for your experience and give you courage to continue?

AQUILA AND PRISCILLA—ALWAYS HOSPITABLE (Acts
18:1-3, 24-26).

   What do the facts about Aquila and Priscilla's origin, birthplace,
previous residence, and an emperor's decree tell you about this couple?
Acts 18:1-3.


   Paul went to Athens alone, leaving behind Silas and Timothy. Soon
he discovered a couple, Aquila and his wife, Priscilla, with whom he
had much in common. They worked at the same trade. They were the
same nationality. They were well-born, and they were refugees. Priscilla
and Aquila had been driven from Rome; Paul from other cities be-
cause of his witnessing.
   When Paul returned to Palestine, the couple went with him as far as
Ephesus. There they met Apollos.

  What do you understand about this couplets gifts, ministry, and
commitment to God's work from their relationship with Apollos? Acts
18:24-26. (Also see Rom. 16:3; 1 Cor. 16:19; 2 Tim. 4:19.)


   Acts 18:26 tells us that Priscilla and Aquila took Apollos aside,
most likely meaning that they took him home with them. Can you
imagine what they said to him? "They shared from their own experi-
ence that the same Jesus whom Apollos had preached was alive.
Surely they explained the profound fulfillment of the atonement of
Calvary, the victory of resurrection morning, and the infilling of the
Spirit of the Lord at Pentecost. Jesus Christ was alive! He was not a
dead hero or even a resurrected but departed Savior. He was present,
and the power of His presence was not around but within the minds
and hearts of His people."—Ogilvie, Acts: The Communicator's Com-
mentary, p. 271.
   Priscilla and Aquila functioned well as a team. Evidently they shared
their views of service and supported each other in ministry. In Corinth
they used their own home for church meetings (1 Cor. 16:19). The fact
that Paul mentions the couple in several letters indicates that he con-
sidered them to be valuable lay workers in the churches to which they
belonged.
   The success of the gospel was due, among others things, to Paul's
encouragement of people like Aquila and Priscilla to use their gifts.
Notice that Paul "went to see them" (Acts 18:2, NIV).

  How can you model Aquila and Priscilla's witnessing example?
 What does their example teach us about teamwork in witnessing?

                                                                      51
Friday                                                    August 4
FURTHER STUDY: Explain how the people in the following texts
are good models for us to imitate in the area of witnessing: Daniel 3:8-
18; Mark 12:41-44; John 4:5-29.
   Read any or all of the following: The Acts of the Apostles, "The First
Christian Martyr" pp. 97-102; "The Gospel in Samaria" pp. 103-111;
"From Persecutor to Disciple" pp. 112-122.

   "Through the ages that have passed since the days of the apostles,
the building of God's temple has never ceased... .
   "Paul and the other apostles, and all the righteous who have lived
since then, have acted their part in the building of the temple. But the
structure is not yet complete. We who are living in this age have a work
to do, a part to act. . . .
   "Christ has given to the church a sacred charge. Every member
should be a channel through which God can communicate to the world
the treasures of His grace, the unsearchable riches of Christ. There is
nothing that the Saviour desires so much as agents who will represent
to the world His Spirit and His character. There is nothing that the
world needs so much as the manifestation through humanity of the
Saviour's love. All heaven is waiting for men and women through
whom God can reveal the power of Christianity."—The Acts of the
Apostles, pp. 598-600.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. List, describe, and discuss the spiritual gifts of Philip, Paul,
     Aquila, and Priscilla. How can these gifts be used today to
     witness in your part of the world?

     2. If Stephen was a deacon, what was Paul's office? What is the
        difference between a gift and an office?

     3. Is witnessing limited to an office? To a gift? Explain your
        answer. What present-day roles in the church are related to
        witnessing?

     4. Wherever Priscilla and Aquila went, they opened their home to
        the church. How can we do the same?

SUMMARIZE this week's lesson by reviewing the lives of the people
we studied this week and stating why they are good models for us to
follow in the area of witnessing. Which person's life inspires you the
most to witness, and why? Because of what you learned about wit-
nessing from this person's life, what will you do differently in your
witnessing?

                  Getting Priorities Straight
                    Beverly Herbrandson Koester

    Being a faithful Seventh-day Adventist in Malawi is not easy. Jobs
are hard to find, and most work places remain open on Sabbath. It
takes great faith to walk away from a job on Friday afternoon, not
knowing if the job will be there on Monday. Youth applying for work
often are tempted to hide their religion for fear they will lose the job
before they even get a chance to prove themselves.
    A strong youth organization in the church is crucial to maintain ties
with God during these difficult times. The youth group at one church
in Blantyre, Malawi was organized to encourage spiritual growth and
outreach. One of its most powerful ministries is its prayer corp. When
a member of the group has a Sabbath or other spiritual problem, the
entire group comes together in prayer. And knowing that friends
understand the difficulties and are praying has helped several young
people grow in faith and strength. One of them is Daniel.
    Daniel had been a faithful member until he went to work at a new
job. Then he began missing church and youth meetings.The prayer
corp began praying for him. Friends stopped by with encouragement
and literature. Daniel appreciated the visits and prayers. He explained
that he was negotiating with his employer to have Sabbaths off and
hoped he would soon have a breakthrough. But friends noticed that he
came to church less and less.
     Then one Sabbath morning Daniel came to church and reported
that his sister was sick and he must go home immediately. He asked
 his friends to pray for her.
     The next Sabbath Daniel was back in church. He told his friends
that his sister was seriously ill but had been glad to see him. "She
asked me to pray for her before I left," he said. He paused a moment,
then continued. "I know she is dying, but she will die in Jesus." The
 peace on his face told of a faith that had grown.
     Daniel was not in church the following week. But later he told his
 friends why. "My sister died Sunday. On Sabbath she told my dad that
 she was dying. But she promised him she would not die on Sabbath so
 that he would not need to make funeral arrangements on that day. God
 let her live until early Sunday. She died peacefully, knowing that God
 accepted her."
     Daniel learned what was really important. Following his sister's
 death he told his employer that he would no longer work on Sabbaths.

      The Tools for Witnessing




Sabbath Afternoon
DORA IS A SENIOR CITIZEN who prays daily for all the missionaries,
evangelists, pastors, and colporteurs. Children take great delight in
visiting her because she tells wonderful stories. Often she shares a
home-baked loaf of bread with a neighbor. Once, when an entire family
was baptized, they said the first person from the church who contacted
them was Dora. After reading the following definition, state why you
think Dora is a missionary.


     DEFINITION: A missionary is someone who crosses a "bar-
     rier" in order to communicate the gospel. This barrier may be a
     different faith or culture, as well as a physical distance.



   This week we will learn about five tools for witnessing. As you
study, decide which tool fits best in your hands and how you will use it
to win souls for Christ.

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE:
  I. Personal Evangelism (Acts 8:26-38).
 11. Personal Testimony (Acts 21:37-22:21).
I11. Health Evangelism (Acts 9:32-35).
IV. Lifestyle Evangelism (Acts 2:44-47; 9:36-42).
 V. Public Evangelism (Acts 8:5, 35; 19:8).

MEMORY TEXT: "And daily in the temple, and in every house,
they did not cease teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ"
(Acts 5:42, NKJV).

PERSONAL EVANGELISM (Acts 8:26-38).


    DEFINITION: Personal evangelism is sharing the gospel
    with an individual or with small groups of people.


   As you review Acts 8:26-38, ask yourself how this incident fits
the above definition of personal evangelism. Think of at least
three principles of personal evangelism this event illustrates.


   " 'Do you understand what you are reading?' " (NKJV). "What
Philip said [to the Ethiopian] was an expression of interest in the man.
People usually respond to the compliment of someone's wanting to
know them and what they are doing. Find out what a person's interests
are and you have hold of the protruding thread with which to unravel
him or her and to know how to share Christ."—Ogilvie, Acts: The
Communicator's Commentary, vol. 5, p. 162.
    Personal Bible studies are important tools of witnessing. Following
is one approach to Bible study that has proven effective.
   A. Visit informally for three to five minutes.
    B. Pray for God's guidance before beginning the study. Let the
students take part by allowing them to respond to your questions, look
up and read texts, and ask questions. Usually, seven to ten Bible texts
will be enough to teach what Scripture says about a doctrine. Be sure
they understand the lesson by asking them such questions as, "Does
this seem reasonable to you?"
    C. Secure a decision at the end of each Bible study. As stated in
lesson 4, a simple way to do so is to ask three questions: (1) "Is this
subject clear to you?" (2) "Do you have questions?" (answer them, if
any); and (3) "Then, are you willing to believe this doctrine?"
    D. Have the students close with a short prayer. Listen carefully.
Their prayers may tell you what they are thinking and how they are
feeling about what they have learned.
    The entire study should not be more than 30-40 minutes, and you
should meet at least once a week.

    How can you make the following quote a reality in your life? "By
 personal labor reach those around you. Become acquainted with them.
 Preaching will not do the work that needs to be done. Angels of God
 attend you to the dwellings of those you visit. This work cannot be done
 by proxy. Money lent or given will not accomplish it. Sermons will not
 do it. By visiting the people, talking, praying, sympathizing with them,
 you will win hearts."—Christian Service, pp. 117, 118.

PERSONAL TESTIMONY (Acts 21:37-22:21).



     DEFINITION: A personal testimony is an account of how
     you yourself have experienced Christ's power. "Tell them
     how you found Jesus, and how blessed you have been since
     you gained an experience in His service. .. . Tell them of the
     gladness and joy that there is in the Christian life."
     —Evangelism, p. 486. The purpose of such an account is to
     create a desire in the heart of the listeners for a similar
     experience of their own.



   The three essential elements of a testimony are:
   1. Your life before you became a Christian. This part of the testi-
mony seeks to establish a bond with the listener.
   2. How you became a Christian. Even if you were brought up in a
Christian home, there was still some point at which you gave your life
to Christ. Your testimony might revolve around an answer to prayer or
a particular victory in your life that made Jesus real to you.
   3. What Jesus means to you now. Tell how your life has changed and
something of the joy you now experience.

   Paul's account of his life in Acts 22 can be divided into the above
three parts of a personal testimony. Find a key phrase for each one of
these parts:

     My life before I became a Christian (Acts 22:3-5).

     How I became a Christian (Acts 22:6-13).

     What Jesus means to me now (Acts 22:14-21).


    "It is the testimony of personal experience that is the irrefutable
argument. It is the power of a life which has been changed that no cynic
or unbeliever can withstand. When the world shakes for fear of what
may befall it, nothing can steady it so much as the simple, direct
statement of a man or a woman who has seen the Lord and whose whole
life is illuminated by the light of the vision."—The Interpreter's Bible,
vol. 9, pp. 291, 292.

   What can I share about my experience with God's grace? Write
your own testimony using the three essential elements listed above.

HEALTH EVANGELISM (Acts 9:32-35).

   Peter's ministry took him to the coastal plain area of Sharon.
Lydda, today called Ludd, is a city located about eleven miles
from Joppa. Describe Peter's ministry there. Acts 9:32-34.


   What is the significance of the word found in verse 33? Explain
the significance of Peter telling Aeneas, " 'Jesus the Christ heals
you' " (v. 34, NKJV).
   What do the results of Aeneas's healing tell you about the
influence health evangelism can have (v. 35)?


   "We are not to wait for souls to come to us; we must seek them out
where they are. When the Word has been preached in the pulpit, the
work has but just begun. There are multitudes who will never be reached
by the gospel unless it is carried to them."—Christian Service, p. 121.
The time period of the man's illness extended back through the ministry
of Jesus. But because Jesus had not healed all the sick, He empowered
many of His followers do to so.
   As in everything else, Jesus is also our example in the area of health
evangelism. He spent more time healing than preaching, knowing as He
did so that many who are afflicted with physical ailments long to know
that their sins are forgiven. (See The Ministry of Healing, p. 77.)
   "Gospel workers should be able also to give instruction in the
principles of healthful living. There is sickness everywhere, and much
of it might be prevented by attention to the laws of health. The people
need to see the bearing of health principles upon their well-being, both
for this life and for the life to come. They need to be awakened to their
responsibility for the human habitation fitted up by their Creator as His
dwelling place, and over which He desires them to be faithful stew-
ards. . . .In teaching health principles, keep before the mind the great
object of reform,—that its purpose is to secure the highest develop-
ment of body and mind and soul. Show that the laws of nature, being
the laws of God, are designed for our good; that obedience to them
promotes happiness in this life, and aids in the preparation for the life
to come."—Evangelism, pp. 525, 526.

   In what ways can your church integrate health ministries
 with evangelistic efforts? How can you participate in health
 ministries even though you may not be a health professional? If
 you are a health professional, think about how you can engage in
 medical evangelism in your church or town.


                                                                      59

LIFESTYLE EVANGELISM (Acts 2:44-47; 9:36-42).


     DEFINITION: Lifestyle evangelism refers to a life that is
     growing and maturing in Christ, while letting the words and
     deeds of that life draw others to Christ. It is presenting the
     gospel by living a good testimony before others. Every Christian
     is a lifestyle evangelist.


   Explain how Dorcas's ministry fulfills the criteria of the above
definition. What do the results of her work tell you about the impor-
tance and effectiveness of lifestyle evangelism? Acts 9:36-42.


   We are to feel empathy and compassion for both Christians and non-
Christians who suffer distressing physical, mental, or emotional prob-
lems. This compassion that leads a person to serve others, including
society's outcasts, is ours when Christ reigns in the heart.
   "First meet the temporal necessities of the needy and relieve their
physical wants and sufferings, and you will then find an open avenue to the
heart, where you may plant the good seeds of virtue and religion."
—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, p. 227. Read Matthew 25:31-46.
   Dorcas's example has inspired the Seventh-day Adventist Church
to establish active Dorcas Societies and Adventist Community Serv-
ices around the world. Families who lose their homes to natural
disasters or fires, people who need a helping hand while between jobs,
parents who find the pantry bare between paychecks, and anyone in
need can still find a helping hand because of one caring person who
lived centuries ago.

  Describe the lifestyle of the early Christians. Acts 2:44-47. What
was the result? Verse 47.


   "Let us remember that a Christlike life is the most powerful argument that
can be advanced in favor of Christianity."—Christian Service, p. 26.

  Contrast Romans 12:9-21 with the behavior of most of the
people you hear or read about in the news. Then analyze why a
Christlike life is such a powerful tool in witnessing.


   Consider your own life in light of Romans 12:9-21. What kind
of impression are you leaving with others?

PUBLIC EVANGELISM (Acts 8:5, 35; 19:8).


    DEFINITION: Public evangelism reaches large groups of
    people through meetings in which they receive doctrinal
    instruction that will enable them to make a responsible deci-
    sion to join the church.




  Provide answers for the following, based on Acts 19:8.

  Place of the meetings:

  Style of the preacher:

   Period of time the meetings were held:

   Methods of evangelism:

  Content of evangelism:


    Peter's sermon on Pentecost (Acts 2:14-40) could be classified as
public evangelism, especially because of its Christ-centered content and
its strong appeal (v. 38). However, evangelistic efforts are not to be
limited to a two-day evangelistic event, a week of harvest evangelism, or
a one-month series of gospel meetings. Interest should be cultivated
before an evangelistic series. Strengthening the spiritual condition of the
church, as well as training church members to help with an evangelistic
series, is also a necessary activity for success. Nurturing new members
and interested people, along with a review of doctrines after the meet-
ings, is just as important as the series itself. (See Evangelism, p. 334.)
    "In the cities of today, where there is so much to attract and please,
the people can be interested by no ordinary efforts. Ministers . . . will
find it necessary to put forth extraordinary efforts in order to arrest the
attention of the multitudes. And when they succeed in bringing to-
gether a large number of people, they must bear messages of a character
so out of the usual order that the people will be aroused and warned."
—Evangelism, p. 122.

   How can I use my gifts in a team for public evangelism?


                                                                        61

FURTHER STUDY: This week we studied five tools of evangelism.
They are: (1) personal evangelism, (2) personal testimony, (3) health
evangelism, (4) lifestyle evangelism, and (5) public evangelism. Deter-
mine which tool is described in the following passages. Be able to
explain why you categorized each passage the way you did: Acts 2:14-
40; Luke 1:46-55; 2 Kings 5:1-15; John 4:1-30.
   Read from Christian Service the chapters entitled "Bible Evangelism"
pp. 141-144; and "Ministry of the Printed Page" pp. 145-154. From Evan-
gelism, read the section entitled "Personal Work" pp. 429-455.

   "As witnesses for Christ, we are to tell what we know, what we
ourselves have seen and heard and felt. If we have been following
Jesus step by step, we shall have something right to the point to tell
concerning the way in which He has led us. We can tell how we have
tested His promise, and found the promise true. We can bear witness to
what we have known of the grace of Christ. This is the witness for
which our Lord calls, and for want of which the world is perishing."
—The Desire of Ages, p. 340.

 DISCUSSION QUESTION:
     Pinpoint the differences between the tools Philip used in Acts
     8:5, 35. Why is it necessary to have several different types of
     tools at our disposal when it comes to witnessing? What do you
     think is the one essential tool for effective witnessing? Why?

SUMMARIZE this week's lesson by defining in your own words per-
sonal evangelism, personal testimony, health evangelism, public evan-
gelism, and lifestyle evangelism. Then do the following activity.
   Under Column A, check which form of evangelism you participated
in during the previous six months. Under column B, check which form

                            J. H. Zachary

   Captain Gregorio Montoya, leader of the 207-officer motorcycle
unit in Lima, Peru, was concerned. His wife worked in the office of the
commander of the Peruvian police force. The man was an Adventist,
and now his wife was becoming interested in the Adventist church. In
fact, she joined a small group that her boss had started. She talked
about the singing, fellowship, Bible reading, and prayer time. One day
Montoya told his wife, "This interest in religion must stop. You must
choose between that small group and me."
   She continued attending the small group meetings in spite of her
husband's threats. Soon she began rising early on Sabbath mornings
while he was still asleep and quietly slipping out to attend the Adventist
worship services as well. But one Sabbath her husband awoke and
followed her to church. He was determined to find out what was so
compelling about the Adventists. Captain Montoya attended the wor-
ship service that day and has not stopped attending since then. He was
baptized in 1996.
    Recently I visited Captain Montoya at his police station. I watched
as a new shift of officers came on duty. Some 24 officers stood at
attention as a short devotional was presented. Then they sang an
enthusiastic gospel song. After closing prayer they received their
orders for the evening.
    Later Montoya said, "I want my officers to follow the principles of
God's Word. None of us receive high salaries. There is always a
temptation to accept bribes. I tell my officers, 'If you take so much as
one cent, you will lose your job and your soul. It is not worth it."'
    Six of Captain Montoya's officers have been baptized in the first
two years following his own baptism. Sixty officers on the force are
studying the Bible. In his off-duty hours Captain Montoya conducts
small Bible study groups for his neighbors and friends.
    With a sense of pride and determination Captain Montoya said,
"With God's help, as our police force discovers and puts into practice
                              the principles of the Bible, Peru will have
                              the best police force in the world."

     Approaches to Witnessing




Sabbath Afternoon
A NEWLY BAPTIZED MEMBER was in the habit of bombarding each
of his friends all in one session with his new-found beliefs about the
Sabbath, unclean meats, and the importance of paying tithe! It wasn't
long before most of them began avoiding him as much as they could. It
is true that when we have good news we are excited and want to tell
everyone everything. But how effective is such an approach when it
comes to witnessing for Christ?
    Soul winning is a science. And if teachers, plumbers, doctors, me-
chanics, etc. train for their profession, why shouldn't we, whom God
calls to witness for Him?
    The objective of a Christian witness is to lead a nonbeliever to
accept Jesus and His truth. Effective evangelism, therefore, should
include a careful process that will lead the nonbeliever through pro-
gressive decisions to the acceptance of the whole truth. This week's
lesson presents such a process. As you study, compare or contrast that
process to how you presently witness. What are you doing correctly?
What things should you change?

FIRST THINGS FIRST (Acts 18:5; 1 Cor. 2:2).

   What was the content of Paul's witnessing in Corinth? Acts 18:5;
1 Cor. 2:2.


    Leading people to Jesus Christ should be our first concern. Securing
a decision for Jesus will assist the presentation of all other biblical
doctrines and will help the person realize that Christ is the center of all
of them. "If those who today are teaching the word of God, would uplift
the cross of Christ higher and still higher, their ministry would be far
more successful. If sinners can be led to give one earnest look at the
cross, . . . they will realize the depth of God's compassion and the
sinfulness of sin."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 209.
    The witness who presents a personal testimony to a nonbeliever
should not focus on doctrinal matters such as the Sabbath or steward-
ship. A personal testimony should transmit the joy found in accepting
the salvation offered through Jesus.
    Likewise, people who do evangelism should secure a decision to
accept Jesus as Savior before teaching doctrines. Once this is done,
they can begin to teach the whole truth. In Matthew 28:20, Jesus
instructed His followers to make disciples by teaching people "to
observe all things" He had commanded them. But even so, such teach-
ing should be done in a logical sequence.

  How did Paul express his confidence that he had done what he
should? Acts 20:27.


    Anyone using any one of the tools of evangelism we studied last
week "must not feel that the whole truth is to be spoken to unbelievers
on any and every occasion. He should study carefully when to speak,
what to say, and what to leave unsaid. This is not practicing deception;
it is working as Paul worked. 'Though I be free from all men,' he wrote to
the Corinthians, 'yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might
gain the more [1 Cor. 9:19-22].' "—Gospel Workers, p. 117.

    "Much careful thought and fervent prayer are required to
 know how to approach men and women upon the great subject
 of truth."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, p. 67. Are you
 acquainted with someone who needs to know Jesus? Pray that
 God will give you an opportunity to introduce Him to that
 person this week. Also pray for wisdom (James 1:5), boldness
 (Acts 4:29), and power (Acts 1:8) when witnessing to her or him.


                                                                        65

APPEALS AND INVITATIONS (Acts 2:38; 3:19).



      DEFINITION: Appeals invite listeners to use their will to
      make a decision based on what they already know about the
      gospel. The most important decision sinners can make is to
      accept Jesus as Savior. All other decisions depend on this
      one.




  Analyze below the appeal Peter made in Acts 2:38. (Compare
Acts 3:19.)

     What did he ask the people to do?



     Why were they to do as Peter instructed?



     What would they receive as a result?



     Why are these three elements essential in an appeal?



   We are all "ambassadors for Christ" and, as such, we are to appeal to
others for a decision "as though God were pleading" through us (2 Cor.
5:20, NKJV). It is a solemn thing to realize that a person's answer to an
appeal has eternal consequences. How important, then, to make an
appeal correctly.
   Most evangelists know that very few people will make a decision
unless they are asked to do so. This is why "in every discourse fervent
appeals should be made to the people to forsake their sins and turn to
Christ."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, p. 396.

    Is it difficult for you to make appeals? If so, how might the
 following appeals direct from the Bible, help you? Deut. 30:19;
 Isa. 1:18; 55:6, 7; Matt. 7:13, 14; 16:24; Acts 16:30, 31; 22:16.

PROGRESSIVE DECISIONS (Acts 16:30, 31; 22:16).

   What appeal did Ananias make to Saul? Acts 22:16.


   The key to helping people decide for baptism is to help them make
progressive decisions. Make an appeal at the end of every Bible study
and sermon. If the person or people respond positively every night,
then responding for baptism will be easier. If you make no invitations
during the series, the appeal for baptism or an altar call at the end will be
a surprise, and many will not respond.
   The following are some basic guidelines.
   1. Lead the people to decide for Christ before presenting doctrines.
Soften the person's heart first by presenting the cross. "More people
than we think are longing to find the way to Christ. Those who preach
the last message of mercy should bear in mind that Christ is to be
exalted as the sinner's refuge. . . . [M]any people are sadly ignorant in
regard to the plan of salvation; they need more instruction upon this
all-important subject than upon any other. . . . Christ and Him cruci-
fied" is "the foundation of the gospel."—Gospel Workers, p. 158.
   2. Do not present doctrines until you are reasonably sure that the
person desires to follow Jesus. "When they surrender heart and mind
and will to God, they are then prepared candidly to weigh evidence in
regard to these solemn, testing truths."—Evangelism, p. 485.
    3. When the people understand the truth, urge them to decide to
obey it with the Lord's help. "Bring the people to the point to decide.
Show them the importance of the truth—it is life or death."—Testimo-
nies for the Church, vol. 1, p. 152.

   For what decision did Paul and Silas appeal to the Philippian
jailer? Acts 16:30, 31.


   "As the meeting progresses the appeals should include not only
accepting Christ but also following Him in loving obedience. When a
person makes a decision of this nature it will generally indicate a
willingness to accept all of the truths they have learned in the meeting.
Specific calls to keep the Sabbath and to join the true church will not
often be necessary. To accept Christ is to accept what Christ taught
and what Christ is doing, which is the primary focus of all the prophetic
teachings of Scriptures and all the doctrines found in the Bible."
—John W. Fowler, Evangelism 2000: Proclaiming Christ in the 21st
Century (Nampa, Idaho: Pacific Press®, 1994), p. 55.

     How does Proverbs 4:18 apply to making "progressive decisions"?

                                                                          67

CONFESSIONS OF FAITH (Acts 8:37; Matt. 10:32, 33; Rom. 10:9).


      DEFINITION: A confession of faith is a statement of faith
      in Jesus. Even though an oral confession is not necessary
      for baptism, a public testimony always affirms a private
      decision. Therefore, it is also useful in evangelism.


   Use different versions of the Bible to study Acts 8:37. What did
the eunuch confess before being baptized?


   Not all versions include verse 37, because some manuscripts of the
Bible do not have it. It should be noted, however, that the Bible
expresses this truth elsewhere. In Matthew 10:32, 33 Jesus says,
"Whoever confesses Me before men, him I will also confess before
My Father who is in heaven" (NKJV). Paul added: "If you confess
with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has
raised Him from the dead, you will be saved" (Rom. 10:9, NKJV).

   What reason for witnessing and sharing your testimony does Rev-
elation 12:11 give?


    The following is an idea for preachers, Sabbath School teachers, Bible
instructors, lay evangelists, pastors, and all others doing evangelism. After
presenting salvation and forgiveness, ask for various individuals to ex-
press a short confession of faith. Ask them to use the name of Jesus,
because "whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved"
(Rom. 10:13) and because "there is no other name under heaven given
among men by which we must be saved" (Acts 4:12, NKJV).
    The following list offers examples of short confessions of faith:
    1."Jesus is my Savior."
    2. "I accept Jesus as my personal Savior."
    3. "Jesus is the king of my heart."
    4. "I want to follow Jesus."
    5. "I give my heart to Jesus."
    6. "I renew my commitment to Jesus."
    Assure your hearers that heaven rejoices when someone confesses
Jesus; that those who believe in the name of the Lord have "the right to
become children of God" (John 1:12, NKJV); and that those "who believe
in the name of the Son of God . . . have eternal life" (1 John 5:13, NKJV).

     Write your own confession of faith.

BAPTISM (Acts 2:38; Mark 16:15, 16).

   Review Acts 8:36-38; 16:29-33; and 22:6-16.


   After Philip preached Jesus to the Ehtiopian ruler, the ruler re-
quested baptism. Philip baptized him immediately, thus illustrating
that no one who believes in Jesus Christ is to be excluded from the
people of God.
   Another dramatic baptism is that of the first Christian baptism in
Europe. The Philippian jailer must have come from a heathen back-
ground. However, he was baptized somewhere between midnight and
sunrise, the same night of his conversion. Notice, though, that he was
not baptized immediately after accepting the invitation to "believe on
the Lord Jesus Christ" (Acts 16:31) but after the apostles "spoke unto
him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house" (v. 32).
    Ananias asked Saul a question that soul winners know very well:
"And now why are you waiting? Arise and be baptized, and wash away
your sins, calling on the name of the Lord" (Acts 22:16, NKJV). The
man who later would be known as "the apostle Paul" did not eat or drink
from the time he met Jesus until the time he was baptized (Acts 9:18, 19).

  What requirements for baptism does the book of Acts mention?
Acts 2:38 (compare Mark 16:16).


    To repent means literally " 'to think differently after,' hence, 'to
change one's mind,' to change one's purpose.' It includes far more
than confession of sin. . . . Theologically the word includes not only a
change of mind but a new direction of the will, an altered purpose and
attitude."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 295.

   Based on the following texts, what does baptism symbolize?


   Rom. 6:3-5


   Col. 2:11,12


   Titus 3:5-7


   Consider this symbolism in relationship to your own life.

                                                                       69

FURTHER STUDY: Read Luke 9:18-20; 22:54-62; and John 21:15-
17. Compare Peter's first confession of Christ with his second confes-
sion. Was Peter serious about his first confession? Explain your an-
swer. Why was his second confession necessary? What does Peter's
story tell us about the seriousness of confessing Christ before others?
   Read any or all of the following chapters or sections from Evange-
lism: "Christ the Center of the Message" pp. 184-193; "Appeals and
Altar Calls" pp. 283-285; "Methods of Clinching Decisions" pp. 295-
301; "Establishing and Holding New Converts" pp. 334-383.

   "Do not at the outset press before the people the most objectionable
features of our faith, lest you close their ears to which these things
come as a new revelation."—Evangelism, p. 201.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Below are nine pairs of doctrines. Based on the concept of
     "progressive decisions," underline which doctrine in each pair
     should be taught first to a nonbeliever:

       Stewardship or Origin of Sin
       Sabbath or Law
       Salvation by Faith or Obedience to God's Law
       Hell or State of the Dead
       Millennium or Second Coming
       Conversion or the Health Message
       Victory over Sin or God's Forgiveness
       Sabbath or the Mark of the Beast
       Sanctification by Faith or Justification by Faith

     2. Classify the doctrines below into (1) introductory Christian
        doctrines, (2) fundamental Adventist doctrines, and (3) distinc-
        tive Adventist doctrines by writing 1, 2, or 3 in the blank by each
        doctrine. At what point in a series of Bible studies or evangelis-
        tic meetings should a person study each classification?

         Forgiveness              Health message              God
         Prayer                   Origin of sin               Sabbath
         Stewardship              Salvation                   Sanctuary
         Law of God               Second Coming


SUMMARIZE in your own words the concept of "progressive deci-
sions." Why is this concept so important? Based on what you have
learned about this concept, what will you do differently in presenting
the gospel to family members and friends who are not Christians?

                       Samithy's Prayer
                            Khut Chouen

    Samithy needed help—fast. A Global Mission pioneer in Cam-
bodia, he had prepared 42 people for baptism and needed a pastor
to come and baptize them. But it was too dangerous for outsiders
to travel the roads around Samrong, where Samithy lived. Many
unwary travelers had been killed by bandits or renegade soldiers.
In addition, it was the height of the rainy season, and the road was
often flooded, making travel nearly impossible.
    But the urgent plea for help came after Samithy encountered a
number of orphans as he visited people. Three young children told
him that their father was killed by soldiers and their mother had
just died of malaria. They had no one care for them. Samithy
located 20 orphans in all who desperately needed care. The chil-
dren had nothing to eat or to wear. With no other alternative, he
took them home until he could find help for them.
    Samithy notified the mission of the urgent need, and the mis-
sion director arranged to charter a small plane and fly to Samrong
with representatives of an international relief group. But the rains
intensified, washing out bridges, flooding the dirt airstrip, and
leaving doubt whether anyone could get to Samrong. Samithy did
the only thing he could do: he prayed, asking God to work it out.
Then he notified his baptismal candidates to meet at the river at the
specified time.
    Two days before the plane was to arrive, the rain stopped, and a
strong north wind began to blow, drying out the dirt airstrip.
Occasionally, threatening storm clouds gathered, but it did not
 rain. Samithy notified the pastor that the airstrip was dry enough to
 land.
    The pastor and relief workers endured a 13-hour trip across
 nearly impassable roads and through rivers to reach the nearest
 airport some 40 miles away. They boarded the small airplane and
 flew through blue skies to Samrong. The pilot examined the air-
 strip to be sure it was dry enough to land, then he set the plane
 down. Friendly soldiers quickly surrounded the plane to protect it
 as Samithy greeted his guests. He hurried them to the river for the
 baptism then took the relief workers to survey the needs of the
 orphans and arrange for their care.
     Their work done, the group boarded the airplane and soon
 disappeared into the distance. Less than an hour after the plane had
 taken off, the rain had returned, flooding the dirt airstrip.

               Church Life and
                 Witnessing




Sabbath Afternoon
WHAT IS "CHURCH"? We use the term to mean a denomination, a
building, or the "body of Christ." This week focuses primarily on the
local congregation.

     DEFINITION: A church is a local community of Christians
     that meets to worship God, expresses its love through fellow-
     ship, receives sustenance from God's Word, and fulfills the
     Great Commission of Jesus Christ.

   The climate of a church determines how it feels to be part of a
particular congregation. A healthy church creates a climate that
stimulates witnessing and nurtures those who accept the gospel.
   The apostolic church developed such a climate and attained such a
balance of worship, nurture, fellowship, and mission that it grew
daily (Acts 2:47). As you study this week's lesson, compare the
apostolic church to your local congregation in the area of witnessing.

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE:
  I. Characteristics of Christian Groups (Acts 2:42-47).
 11. A Peculiar Lifestyle (Acts 1:14; 2:42, 44; 11:26).
I11. Prayer Meeting (Acts 12:1-19).
IV. Boldness in Witnessing (Acts 4:23-30; 8:14, 15).
 V. Christ-Centered Preaching (Acts 2:22-24, 32, 33, 36).

MEMORY TEXT: "Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee
and Samaria enjoyed a time of peace. It was strengthened; and
encouraged by the Holy Spirit, it grew in numbers, living in the
fear of the Lord" (Acts 9:31, NIV).

CHARACTERISTICS OF CHRISTIAN GROUPS (Acts 2:42-47).

  List the characteristics of the early Christians. Acts 2:42-47.


    The early Christians had three main purposes. They were also
devoted to four functions essential for a vibrant Christian life. These
functions are a part of the three purposes. All of our church meetings
today should aim to meet these three purposes and fulfill these four
functions:
    1. An upward purpose: to glorify God.
                                       God. The disciples "were con-
tinually in the temple, praising and blessing God" (Luke 24:53).
Worship, then, is one of the four functions. Praise and prayer charac-
terized the worship of the early church.
    2. An inward purpose: to grow spiritually and to enjoy fellowship
with other members. Another two of the functions, therefore, are
nurture and fellowship. Notice that the early Christians were devoted
to the apostles' doctrine. This devotion nurtured them with the spirit-
ual food they needed for becoming like Christ.
    Christian fellowship is not merely a subjective feeling of belong-
ing. It is different from membership in a tennis club or civic group.
Christian fellowship is more like the commitment of love and obliga-
tion we have toward members of our own family. That is why the
early church "had everything in common" and ate together.
    3. An outward purpose: to preach the gospel. The fourth function
of any church should be mission. The early church demonstrated a
sense of mission like no other church since. A group of individuals
sharing together in worship, nurture, and community will not be
legitimate if its members remain inward. As a result of outreach, the
early disciples received new converts into the church every day.
    Had everything in common. "To have things in common was not
unusual in Jewish life of the time. Visitors to the yearly feasts often
had their needs supplied by their friends in Jerusalem. It is clear,
 however, that something more than this is implied in Luke's state-
ment. The Christians were thrown back upon themselves, and a new, a
Christian, economy was set up. However, this does not mean the
 institution of what is called Christian socialism. It was probably a
 continuation and enlargement of the tag,' or common purse, of John
12:6; 13:29. The new converts would be the more ready to share their
 material possessions because of their new-found love for Christ and
 for one another, and their earnest expectations of the Lord's soon
 return."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 149.

    How can modern churches meet the above three purposes
 and fulfill the four functions? How is your church managing this
 responsibility? How can you help to make improvements?

                                                                    73
Monday                                                August 21
A PECULIAR LIFESTYLE (Acts 1:14; 2:42, 44; 11:26).

  Early followers of Jesus were distinguished by their fellowship.
Which expressions in the following verses describe the together-
ness of the early Christians?

     Acts 1:14


     Acts 2:42


     Acts 2:44

   "The proclamation of the gospel was to be world-wide in its
extent, and the messengers of the cross could not hope to fulfill their
important mission unless they should remain united in the bonds of
Christian unity, and thus reveal to the world that they were one with
Christ in God."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 90.
   Friendship with other members is the first step toward a new
member's assimilation into the church. If fellowship is absent, the
church will stagnate or decline. If new members cannot name a
minimum of seven new friends in the church within their first six
months of membership, they will leave. (See Win Arn, The Church
Ratio Book [Pasadena, Calif.: Church Growth, 1987], p. 23.)

 Where were the disciples first called "Christians"? Acts 11:26.
Why?


   The title of "Christian" may have arisen from local gossip: "Those
people are always talking about Christ!" Earlier, they were called
those "who were of the Way" (Acts 9:2, NKJV; also see 19:23 and
24:14).
   "Living, as they were, in the midst of a people who seemed to care
but little for the things of eternal value, they sought to arrest the
attention of the honest in heart, and to bear positive testimony con-
cerning Him whom they loved and served. In their humble ministry
they learned to depend upon the power of the Holy Spirit to make
effective the word of life. And so, in the various walks of life, they
daily bore testimony of their faith in Christ."—The Acts of the
Apostles, p. 158.

  List the names of some of the new members in your church.
How can you make them feel welcome?

PRAYER MEETING (Acts 12:1-19).

   It was Passover. To please his opponents, Herod had ordered the
arrest of Peter. He had planned to give Peter to the people, much as
Pilate had done with Jesus. Despite the imminence of his execution,
Peter slept while the church in Jerusalem prayed for him.

  How does the Bible translation you are using describe the
believers' prayers? Acts 12:5.


    The Greek word translated "without ceasing" or "constant" (NKJV)
is the same word that describes Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane (Luke
22:44). In 1 Peter 4:8, the word is translated "fervent" and suggests
great intensity. We do not know the exact words of their prayers.
Were they praying for Peter's release? For the will of the Lord to be
done? What does one pray for under such circumstances?
    We do know, however, that their prayers were answered even
while they prayed. God moves on His own schedule in answering our
prayers. Sometimes He waits, and sometimes He does not even wait
for the "Amen." The latter happened in this case.

  How did the believers react to Peter's deliverance? Imagine
what may have happened in that prayer meeting after Peter left.
Acts 12:13-17.


   In the book Christian Service, pages 211-214, we find the follow-
ing advice regarding prayer in the church as a form of witnessing:
   1. Prayer meetings should help and encourage those attending. To
do this, we should share our own experiences.
   2. Prayer meetings should be interesting. Avoid lengthy speeches
and formal prayers.
   3. Praise and thanksgiving should also characterize our prayer
meetings. These will prevent us from complaining and will dispel the
power of Satan.

   Can you think of other ways prayer in the church family can
serve as a form of witnessing?


   What is missing in the prayer meetings of your church? List

Wednesday                                            August 23
BOLDNESS IN WITNESSING (Acts 4:23-30; 8:14, 15).

   After Jesus ascended to heaven and before the coming of the Holy
Spirit, the disciples met for long seasons of prayer in an upper room
and went to the temple where they praised and blessed God (Luke
24:50-53). This combination of praise and worship with sincere
prayer and supplication is an unfailing formula for drawing near to
God.

   For what did the church in Jerusalem pray after the Sanhedrin
released Peter and John? Acts 4:23-30.


     What convictions did the believers express in this prayer?

     verse 24


     verses 27, 28


     verses 29, 30

   Their prayer itself became a witness as they expressed in it their
belief in their Creator and their expectations that He would help them
to perform "signs and wonders" (NKJV). Surely their times of prayer
together matched the requirements set forth for such meetings in
yesterday's lesson.

  According to Acts 8:14, 15, for what specific matter did the
apostles pray in Samaria?


   "The Lord is more willing to give the Holy Spirit to those who
serve Him than parents are to give good gifts to their children. For
the daily baptism of the Spirit every worker should offer his petition
to God. . . . The presence of the Spirit with God's workers will give
the proclamation of truth a power that not all the honor or glory of
the world could give."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 50, 51.

   If your local church were facing the same type of persecution
the Jerusalem congregation was facing in Acts 4, how would its
members respond? Pray that with the indwelling of the Holy
Spirit, you and your fellow church members always will be able
to witness boldly.

CHRIST-CENTERED PREACHING (Acts 2:22-24, 32, 33, 36).

   Summarize in your own words Peter's sermon at Pentecost.
Acts 2:22-24, 32, 33, 36. What were the results? Based on these
results, what conclusion can you draw about the content of ser-
mons?

   Your Summary            Sermon Results          Conclusions




    Peter's sermon, as do many of the sermons in Acts, consists of five
points. These points may not always appear in the same order, and
occasionally some of the sermons will omit a point. But generally they
are there. These five points answer the following questions:
    1. What did Jesus do? (v. 22).
    2. What did the nonbelievers do? (v. 23).
    3. What did God do? (v. 24).
    4. What are we (Jesus' followers) doing now? (v. 32).
    5. What can you do? (v. 38).
    Without focusing on Christ in our preaching ministries, "there is
little incentive for our members to bring their non-Adventist friends
to church. If they bring their neighbors and friends and we preached
Christ and made calls to accept and follow Him, it would bring a new
dynamic into our churches as it does our public meetings."—Fowler,
Evangelism 2000, p. 52.

  Evaluate Peter's presentation of Jesus as Savior in Acts 4:12.
Then use your own words to describe his message.



   When sinners accept Jesus as Savior and call upon the name of the
Lord, His blood cleanses them from all sin. The believers then
become new creatures who want to keep the commandments of God
through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Their names are written in
the Book of Life (see Acts 16:31; 22:16; Rom. 1:13; 1 John 1:7;
2 Cor. 5:17; John 14:15; Gal. 5:16-26; Rev. 21:27).

   Review the five questions Peter's sermon raises in Acts 2 by
 reading each answer as if you were a part of the audience. Do
 you have the assurance that Jesus forgives your sins? Do you
 have eternal life? Tell it to others!

                                                                    77

FURTHER STUDY: This week we studied various characteristics of
church life that serve as part of the church's witnessing activities.
Read the following verses to discover another characteristic of a
healthy church that serves as a positive witness: Malachi 3:8-10;
Mark 12:41-44; 2 Corinthians 8:1-7.
  Also read any or all of the following: Testimonies to Ministers and
Gospel Workers, "The Church of Christ" pp. 15-32; The Acts of the
Apostles, "A Liberal Church" pp. 335-345.

   "God has a church on earth who are lifting up the downtrodden
law, and presenting to the world the Lamb of God that taketh away
the sins of the world. The church is the depositary of the wealth of the
riches of the grace of Christ, and through the church eventually will
be made manifest the final and full display of the love of God to the
world that is to be lightened with its glory."—Testimonies to Minis-
ters and Gospel Workers, p. 50.

     DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
     1. How friendly does your church seem to a first-time visitor?
        What is your church doing correctly in this area? What
        needs to be improved?

     2. Imagine a visitor eating alone during a fellowship dinner.
        What might this person feel or think? How can we solve
        this common situation? Are "potlucks" enough of an ex-
        pression of fellowship? Explain the difference between eat-
        ing at the church and eating in the intimacy of a home. How
        can fellowship dinners be given a more homelike atmos-
        phere?

     3. Believers were first called Christians in Antioch because
        their church life showed the city that they followed Christ.
        What is your congregation's church life showing your com-
        munity?

SUMMARIZE this week's lesson by describing in your own words
the type of church life that serves as a witness to not only the
community but the world.

                 Buddhist Monk Finds Christ
                             J. H. Zachary

   When Thongsouay Sakdarak was 11 years old, his Laotian parents
sent him to a monastery to study to become a Buddhist monk. He
remained for 12 years, mastering the writings of Buddha. He left the
monastery to teach history. Then in 1983 he and his wife fled Laos for
Thailand.
    While living in a refugee camp, Sakdarak met a Christian man who
talked to him about the Bible. One day his friend read John 1:1 to him.
The verse startled Sakdarak. He recalled that Buddha had said that if his
followers obeyed the Word, they would be released from sin. Sakdarak
recalled other scriptures that told of the Messiah who would come.
    His friend gave him a Bible. As he read, he found the crucifixion
story. Sakdarak recalled that the Buddhist scriptures had stated that the
coming Messiah would have marks or circles in his hands and feet.
    After two months of careful study, the former monk was baptized.
He began teaching the Bible to fellow refugees. He explained to them
that the one message that runs through the teachings of Buddha is that
those who find the true Word and obey it will be saved. Sakdarak
shared this good news with anyone who would listen.
    But when he told his wife, Khanthaly, about his discovery, she did
not share his joy. In fact, she took his Bible, threw it on the ground, and
jumped on it. Within her culture this was the highest level of insult one
could give.
    Sakdarak was crushed at his wife's response. For two weeks the
couple did not speak or even look at each other. A divorce seemed
unavoidable.
    Then one day Khanthaly reluctantly went to church with Sakdarak.
A Laotian hymn touched her heart, and the Holy Spirit opened her
understanding. In spite of strong resistance from her family, Khanthaly
took her stand for Christ.
           Today the Sakdaraks work among the Laotian refugees in
                            Southern California. Sakdarak has written two
                            books that compare the Bible and Buddha's
                            writings and show that Jesus is the promised
                            Word, the Messiah, the Son of God.

     Structures for Witnessing

Sabbath Afternoon
ORGANIZATION EQUALS SURVIVAL. A honeybee colony requires
an organized structure for survival. The queen lays the eggs that hatch
into worker bees. The worker bees do all the chores, including gathering
nectar and pollen, cleaning empty cells, and fanning fresh air into and
stale air out of the hive. The drones mate with the queen.
   "System and order are manifest in all the works of God throughout
the universe. Order is the law of heaven, and it should be the law of
God's people on the earth."—Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel
Workers, p. 26.
   Members of a local church may organize structures for witnessing
in several different ways, including: (1) assigning territory, (2) orga-
nizing small groups, (3) creating teams, and (4) sending their own
"missionaries" to "nonentered areas." This week we will take a closer
look at each of these four structures to see how they enable us to be
effective witnesses for Jesus Christ. As you study, think about which
structure best suits your gifts and talents and how you can begin to
work within that structure.
THE WEEK AT A GLANCE:
  I. Territorial Assignments (Acts 1:8; 22:21).
 11. Witnessing Teams (Acts 13:13; 20:4).
I11. House Churches (Acts 2:46, 47; 5:42; 12:12).
IV. Church Planting (Acts 9:31; 14:21-23).
 V. Missionary Families (Acts 18:1-3, 18, 24-26).
MEMORY TEXT: "For so the Lord has commanded us: 'I have
set you to be a light to the Gentiles, that you should be for salva-
tion to the ends of the earth' " (Acts 13:47, NKJV).

TERRITORIAL ASSIGNMENTS (Acts 1:8; 22:21).

   Where did God first ask the apostles to serve as witnesses? Acts
1:8.


   Acts 1:8 "gives the outline for the book of Acts: The proclamation of
the gospel to (1) Jerusalem and Judea (chs. 1 to 7), (2) Samaria (chs. 8
through 10), (3) and the uttermost part of the earth (chs. 11 to 28)."
—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 124. Jesus instructed His followers
to expand their witnessing activities in broadening circles so that eventu-
ally they would cover the whole earth with the knowledge of the gospel.

   To what specific territories did God call Paul and Peter?


   Acts 22:21


   Gal. 2:7, 8


    In Old Testament times, each tribe of Israel received a specific
territory as they entered the Promised Land (Joshua 13-23). Even
though we do not see such a precise arrangement in the New Testa-
ment, it is clear where God wanted these two apostles to serve.
    The basic territory assigned to the member of a church is that
member's own family and neighborhood. The Church Manual is clear
in this respect: "Since evangelism is the primary work of the church, the
first item on the agenda of each church board meeting is to relate
directly to the evangelization of the missionary territory of the
church. . . . As far as possible, each family and member should be
encouraged to accept an assignment of territory. Every home in the
church territory will thus be assigned to a church member. The mem-
ber will be encouraged to [make] . . . missionary contacts in every
home of one section of that territory."-1995 ed., pp. 80, 81. Acts 1:8
assures us that we will be given the power to do so. But it is no
ordinary power. The word "dynamite" comes from the Greek word
dunamis, which in this verse is translated "power." Such power "gives
(1) power within, (2) power to proclaim the gospel, (3) power to lead
others to God."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 124.

   Name at least three persons within your area of influence.
 Pray for these people and ask God to give you the opportunities
 and the power to serve as a witness before them.

WITNESSING TEAMS (Acts 13:13; 20:4).

  What do Acts 13:13 and 20:4 suggest about Paul's strategies for
mission?


    According to Luke's records, very soon after Barnabas and Saul
began their first missionary trip, there were two major changes in the
affairs of their mission:
    1.After referring to the encounter with Bar-Jesus the sorcerer, Luke
starts using the Roman name Paul (Acts 13:9).
   2. Luke abandons the expression "Barnabas and Saul" (12:25; 13:2,7)
and for the first time speaks of "Paul and his company" (13:13).
    Because Paul took Barnabas and John Mark with him on his first
missionary journey, he believed in teamwork. Later he chose Silas
(15:40). And in Lystra, he asked Timothy to accompany him (Acts 16:1-
3). Acts and the Epistles mention the names of many people who
worked side by side with Paul. He felt better when he was with his
fellow workers (see Acts 17:15; 1 Thess. 3:1; 2 Cor. 2:12, 13). But his
preference for them was not dictated only by his desire for companion-
ship. It was related to effectiveness in ministry (Mark 6:7; Luke 10:1).
   Keep holding hands. A group of children were hiking in the woods
along an abandoned railroad track. All of the children tried walking
along the narrow rails but would fall off soon after they started. The
last two children to try jumped on opposite rails, reached out to hold
hands, and walked the section without losing their balance.
   Working together as a team can solve many problems and create a
strength no one person could ever have alone.
   "Why do not believers feel a deeper, more earnest concern for those
who are out of Christ? Why do not two or three meet together and plead
with God for the salvation of some special one, and then for still
another? In our churches let companies be formed for service. Let
different ones unite in labor as fishers of men. Let them seek to gather
souls from the corruption of the world into the saving purity of Christ's
love. . . . Let them reveal Christlike forbearance and patience, speaking
no hasty words, using the talent of speech to build one another up on
the most holy faith. Let them labor in Christlike love for those outside
the fold, forgetting self in their endeavor to help others. As they work
and pray in Christ's name, their numbers will increase."—Testimonies
for the Church, vol. 7, pp. 21, 22.

    Consider your friends in the church and the talents they
 have. How could you join together with them to form an effec-
 tive witnessing team?

HOUSE CHURCHES (Acts 2:46, 47; 5:42; 12:12).

   The early Christian church did not own buildings but used private
houses as its primary place of worship. From the beginning, homes
appear to have been the place for the most important aspects of early
church life. On the Day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit manifested His
presence and power "as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the
house where they were sitting" (Acts 2:2).
   Acts records the many church activities that took place in believers'
homes:
   1.prayer meetings (12:12),
   2. fellowship (21:7),
   3. "breaking bread" (2:46),
   4. worship and instruction (20:7, 11; 5:42),
   5. impromptu evangelistic gatherings (16:32), and
   6. planned meetings in order to proclaim the gospel (10:22).
   Paul also worked out of various homes. In Thessalonica, he used
Jason's house as his base of operation (17:5-7); while in Corinth he
"entered in the house of a certain man named Justus" (18:7, 8, NKJV).
   Early Adventists followed a similar pattern. At first they "assembled
for worship, and presented the truth to those who would come to hear,
in private houses, in large kitchens, in barns, in groves, and in school-
houses."—Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, p. 26.

  Provide the names of families who offered their homes as "house
churches." Rom. 16:3-5; Col. 4:15; Philem. 1, 2.

CHURCH PLANTING (Acts 9:31; 14:21-23).

   Paul and Barnabas preached in the region of Lycaonia (Acts
14:6, 7) and planted churches there. What did they do in order to
secure these churches? Acts 14:21-23.



     DEFINITION: Church planting means proclaiming the gospel
     in a certain area and then gathering into fellowship groups
     those in that area who believe so they can worship, receive
     nurture, and work for others in the extension of the king-
     dom of God.




    In New Testament times, because many believers were Hebrews, they
continued worshiping God in the synagogues. When they gathered with
other believers who were not Hebrews for such activities as fellowship,
prayer, worship, or the Lord's Supper, they met in homes. Ekklesia, the
Greek word for church, simply means "assembly," "gathering," or "con-
gregation." It did not refer to a church building as we know it today.
Does your area need more and varied churches?
    Witnessing should not be limited to listening to our neighbors when they
have a problem, giving our testimony to a nonbeliever, or even sharing
the gospel through a Bible study. As the number of individuals who are
evangelized increases, so also must the number and variety of churches.
"Those who are the chosen of God are required to multiply churches
wherever they may be successful in bringing souls to the knowledge of the
truth."—Testimonies to Ministers and Gospel Workers, p. 199.

   What happens when Christians walk "in the fear of the Lord and in
the comfort of the Holy Spirit"? Acts 9:31.


  Experience demonstrates that "the single most effective evangelistic
methodology under heaven is planting new churches."—C. Peter Wagner,
Church Planting for a Greater Harvest (Ventura, Calif.: Regal Books,
1990), p. 11.

    It is a proven fact that new churches usually grow faster than
 established congregations. Why do you think this is so? Which
 nearby cities, villages, or neighborhoods in your area do not
 have an Adventist presence? What is the possibility of planting a
 church in one of those places?

MISSIONARY FAMILIES (Acts 18:1-3, 18, 24-26).

  Answer the following questions by reading Acts 18:1-3:

  What was Aquila and Priscilla's occupation?



  Why did they go to Corinth?

   How did Paul establish contact with them? Acts 18:1-3.



  Why did Paul engage in "secular" labors? 1 Thess. 2:9; Acts
20:32-35.

    DEFINITION: "Tentmakers" are missionaries who earn a
    living by engaging in secular employment while also doing
    missionary work in the country or city where they work.


   While in Corinth, Aquila and Priscilla helped Paul establish a
church by offering their house to be used for church activities (1 Cor.
16:19). They accompanied Paul (Acts 18:18, 19) to Ephesus (modern
Turkey), where again they were instrumental in planting a church
(Acts 18:18-26). Later they returned to Rome (Rom. 16:3, 4).
   The traditional model of church planting requires families and
individuals to start worshiping together on Sabbath morning in a non-
entered location, yet usually within the area of influence of an already
established church.
   The "colonization model" of church planting requires that a nucleus
of members, sent by the parent church, moves to a different geographical
area. Those members must sell their homes, find new jobs, and send their
children to new schools. "Missionary families are needed to settle in the
waste places. Let farmers, financiers, builders, and those who are skilled
in various arts and crafts, go to neglected fields, to improve the land, to
establish industries, to prepare humble homes for themselves, and to help
their neighbors."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 194.

    Do you think it takes more commitment and self-sacrifice to
 witness as a "tentmaker" than it does to witness any other way?
 Explain your answer. In what way are all forms of witnessing
 equal in God's sight?

                                                                        85

FURTHER STUDY: This week we discussed organizing structures
for witnessing that included: (1) assigning territory, (2) organizing
small groups, (3) creating teams, and (4) sending "missionaries" to
"unentered areas." Read the following passages and decide which of
these structures each passage describes: Luke 10:1; Mark 5:18-20;
Genesis 12:1-3.
   Also read any or all of the following: Christian Service, "The Church
Expansion Movement" pp. 178-185; "The Home a Missionary Train-
ing Center" pp. 206-210; "Organizing Christian Forces" pp. 72-76;
The Acts of the Apostles, "Heralds of the Gospel" pp. 166-176.

   "The formation of small companies as a basis of Christian effort is a
plan that has been presented before me by One who cannot err. If there
is a large number in the church, let the members be formed into small
companies, to work not only for the church members but for unbelievers
also."—Evangelism, p. 115.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. This week we discussed certain organized structures that the
     church uses for witnessing. How important is church organiza-
     tion to witnessing? Can organization ever get in the way of
     witnessing? Explain your answer.

     2. How do our educational and health systems serve as witnesses?
        The publishing work?

SUMMARIZE in your own words the following concepts from this
week's lesson: (1) Why is organization important to certain forms of
witnessing? (2) How do the following organized structures help us to
witness more effectively: the assignment of territories; the organization
of small groups; the creation of teams; arranging for "tentmakers" to
live in "unentered" territories?

                       Because of Dogs
                            Omar Patio

    It was Holy Week, the week during which much of the world
focuses on the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ. In Bolivia
the Adventist Church chooses this week to draw people to Christ
through evangelistic meetings.
    Following the counsel in the Spirit of Prophecy, the church has
organized itself into small groups that form hundreds of ministry
centers throughout the country that are effective tools to draw
people into Bible studies. During Holy Week the churches hold
special programs to reach these people for Christ. The Hamacas
Church is located in a neighborhood that has been difficult to
reach in the past. But lay members continue to pray and work for
souls, and during the 1998 Holy Week meetings, God used dogs to
bring one young woman to a knowledge of truth.
    Eighteen-year-old Ellie Arcaya was returning home from school.
She worked all day and attended school at night, leaving little time
to attend religious meetings. Suddenly two street dogs ran out
from behind some trees, barking fiercely. The young woman knew
these dogs were unpredictable and could bite her. With nothing to
defend herself against the dogs, she ran toward a nearby open gate
and slipped through a door to escape the dogs. She found herself
inside a church.
    Fearful to leave the church lest the dogs were waiting for her
outside, she sat down in the last row to catch her breath. Since she
was inside the church, she felt it would be rude not to listen to the
sermon. She had never heard the Bible explained so clearly be-
 fore, and she decided to return the following night.
    Ellie continued to attend the meetings and requested the Bible
 course that was offered. By the time she had completed the stud-
 ies, she had given her life to Jesus and requested baptism. At her
 baptism she told how God had used two ferocious dogs to grab her
 attention and lead her to Jesus. Ellie's family expelled her from
 their home when she joined the Adventist Church, but she remains
 determined to remain safely in the hands of Christ.
     Just as Ellie had fled the fierce dogs, many people are fleeing
 the enemy of souls. Will they find a safe refuge in your church?
 Will they find protection and salvation there?

     Places and Occasions for
            Witnessing




Sabbath Afternoon
"EVANGELISM IS FOR NONBELIEVERS. And it should be done
under a tent! Not here!" someone whispered to his wife while the pastor
extended an altar call at the end of the sermon.
    But a careful look in the book of Acts reveals a surprising variety of
places where early Christians shared the gospel with others. The first,
immediately after Pentecost, was "in the temple" (Acts 2:46) and then
"in many villages" (8:25), in a chariot (8:28-31), "in the synagogues"
(13:5), "by a river side" (16:13), in a prison (16:23-25), "in the
market" (17:17), "in the midst of Mars' hill" (17:22), in a school
(19:9), on a ship (27:21-25), and in Paul's lodging (28:23).
   When did the early Christians witness? They did so "at the hour of
prayer" (3:1), "early in the morning" (5:21), "at midnight" (16:25),
"daily" (17:17; 19:9), and "from morning till evening" (28:23). Of
course, they also witnessed on the Sabbath day (13:42, 44; 16:13; 17:2).
   This week we will examine in depth the "when" and the "where" of
witnessing. As you study, consider your own life. When and where do
you witness? Is it a natural part of your life that you have cultivated
with the assistance of the Holy Spirit?

FRIENDSHIP EVANGELISM (Acts 10:1, 2, 21, 22, 24).


    DEFINITION: A "network" refers to "a group of people
    who relate informally through voluntary associations, pro-
    fessional contacts, family or racial ties, or other connec-
    tions."—Ray Bakke and Jim Hart, The Urban Christian
    (Downers Grove, Ill.: Inter Varsity Press, 1987), p. 14.


   There are many biblical examples that show how, once the gospel
has been introduced by an outsider, church growth takes place through
new converts or through a network of personal relationships.

  What can you learn about "network evangelism" from the following
examples? Acts 10:1, 2, 21, 22, 24; Mark 5:18-20.


   Two facts underline the importance of "network evangelism." The
first fact is related to the question, "How did you join the church?"
Between 60 and 90 percent of church members answer that their first
contact with the faith was through Adventist relatives, friends, and
neighbors. The second fact is related to the knowledge that the closer
the relationship a church member has with nonbelievers, the less costly
and more effective it is to bring the unbeliever into the church.
    Most relatives and friends of a newly baptized person are not church
members. After a time, however, the new member's circle of friends
includes mostly members of the church. Before this happens, newly
baptized persons should be encouraged to witness to their network of
relatives, workmates and classmates, neighbors, friends, and even those
with whom they used to worship.

    The chart below is divided into three categories: immediate
 family members, relatives, and friends. Record the names of at
 least three persons under each column with whom you wish to
 share Jesus. Pray for them often, mentioning them by name.
 Pray also that God will give you opportunities to witness to
 them.

HOUSE EVANGELISM (Acts 5:42; 20:20; 28:17-31).

   The early Christians felt overwhelmed by the size of the task Jesus
left for them. They did not begin by making plans to cover the whole
world. They began in one house. Then they visited people "in every
house" (5:42) in Jerusalem, then in all Judea and Samaria (1:8). The
work that began thus will be finished the same way. "How can the
great work of the third angel's message be accomplished? It must be
largely accomplished by persevering, individual effort, by visiting the
people in their homes."— Welfare Ministry, p. 97.

  What can we learn about house evangelism from the texts in the
chart below?


      Acts 5:42              Acts 20:20              Acts 28:17-31




    The book of Acts begins with Christ's followers' praying and
waiting for the Holy Spirit in the upper room of a house in Jerusalem.
From this humble beginning, believers received strength and courage
to spread the gospel in Antioch, Ephesus, and Rome, the most influen-
tial cities of the world at that time. But the book of Acts ends where it
began. While under arrest, Paul witnesses from a house where he lived
with the guards who were most likely chained directly to him. From such
a humble position, it is believed that Paul wrote his letters to the
Ephesians, the Philippians, the Colossians, and to Philemon.
   "The lay members of our churches can accomplish a work which, as
yet, they have scarcely begun. . . . They can distribute our publications,
hold meetings in their homes, become acquainted with their neighbors,
and invite them to come to these meetings."—Christian Service, pp.
178, 179.

   What does Paul's experience of being under house arrest in Rome
teach us about witnessing?


   What approach should I follow in inviting my friends, rela-
tives, and neighbors to my house? How can I approach them
with an invitation to participate in a Bible-study group?

SABBATH SCHOOL EVANGELISM (Acts 16:13-15; 18:1-4).

  Where did Paul meet with others to study the Word of God and
pray?

   Acts 16:13-15

   18:1-4

   Even though the Sabbath School concept is relatively new, it is
possible to use these texts to support the idea of using Sabbath Schools
to win souls. The Sabbath School not only provides many opportuni-
ties for nurturing existing members, but it is a useful tool for attracting
visitors, nurturing and preparing nonmembers for baptism, and pro-
viding care and follow-up for newly baptized members.
    Most people will have their first contact with the church through a
Sabbath School. As visitors come to church for the first time, the
warmth and quality of the Sabbath School program most likely will play
an important part in helping them to decide whether they will return.

 What approach to Bible study did Paul follow in Corinth? Acts 18:4.
What does this tell us about how to conduct Sabbath Schools?

    The following suggestions relate to the way we deal with visitors
attending our Sabbath School services.
    1. Visitors might get more from our meetings if they attended a
separate Sabbath School Action Unit. "Many who listen frequently to
sermons, even though the truth be presented in clear lines, learn but
little. Often it would be more profitable if the Sabbath meetings were of
the nature of a Bible class study."—Evangelism, p. 348.
    2. Instead of studying the regular Adult Sabbath School Bible
Study Guide, visitors might benefit more from a study on Bible doc-
trines. The teacher of such an Action Unit should possess the gifts of
teaching and evangelism.
    3. Members, especially those who have been newly baptized, might
profit from attending such a visitors' class. But it might be advisable
not to have visitors in a regular Sabbath School Action Unit because of
some of the subjects that might come under discussion based on the
topic of any one current Bible Study Guide.

    "The Sabbath school should be one of the greatest instrumen-
 talities, and the most effectual, in bringing souls to Christ."
 —Counsels on Sabbath School Work, p. 10. How can this be a
 reality in my own church?

                                                                         91

  What groups listened to Paul and Barnabas in Pisidian Antioch?

     1.

     2.

     3.

   In Pisidian Antioch, located in the province of Galatia, Paul and
Barnabas attended synagogue services, as was their habit. They used
these opportunities to preach the gospel. Their sermons helped many
people of the Hebrew faith, including those who had converted to
Judaism, to accept Jesus as the Christ. But their sermons also assisted
Gentiles, who were visiting, in understanding the gospel. Evidently the
two apostles had learned how to combine worship with evangelism.

  What did Paul do at Corinth on Sabbath days? Acts 18:4, 5. What
two principles in particular do these verses give us regarding worship
evangelism?



     2.



      DEFINITION: Worship evangelism makes worship services
      an evangelistic tool by presenting doctrinal subjects during
      the sermon and by offering invitations in each sermon for
      those present to accept Jesus as their Savior. Worship evan-
      gelism may be offered throughout the year, on a permanent
      basis, in the regular worship of a church.


   Every sermon should move the audience closer to Jesus; "the science
of salvation" should "be the burden of every sermon."—Gospel Work-
ers, p. 160. If we would follow these guidelines, we would see conver-
sions and renewals of commitments to Jesus in our church services.

   How can the worship services in your church be used as a means
of evangelism? What can you do personally to help it be so?

URBAN EVANGELISM (Acts 17:16; 18:1, 9, 10).

  What did Paul experience as he visited the city of Athens? Acts
17:16.


  Acts 15-19 describes Paul working in five urban centers:
  (1) chapter 15—Jerusalem;
  (2) chapter 16—Philippi;
  (3) chapter 17—Athens;
  (4) chapter 18—Corinth;
  (5) chapter 19—Ephesus.

   Why did the Lord encourage Paul to stay in Corinth after he
finished his initial evangelistic effort? Acts 18:9, 10.

   There are many reasons why we should have a strong missionary
presence in cities: (1) industry, government, and education generally
concentrate in cities; (2) masses of the population emigrate daily from
the countryside to urban centers; (3) urban poor, living in slum areas,
comprise between a fourth to a half of the population of many of the
largest cities (for many reasons, these people are more responsive to
the gospel than any other group); and (4) more than half the world's
population live in urban areas.
   Because cities are centers "where the enemy is served in every way,
and where God is so often forgotten" (Life Sketches, p. 410), believers,
and families especially, are encouraged to live in more rural areas (for
example, see Ellen G. White's Country Living, p. 24 and The Adventist
Home, p. 139).
   What is the best way, then, to evangelize cities? "Repeatedly the
Lord has instructed us that we are to work the cities from outpost
centers. In these cities we are to have houses of worship, as memorials
for God, but institutions for the publication of our literature, for the
healing of the sick, and for the training of workers are to be established
outside the cities."—Country Living, p. 31.
   "Lot could have preserved his family from many evils, had he not
made his home in this wicked, polluted city [Sodom]. All that Lot and
his family did in Sodom could have been done by them, even if they had
lived in a place some distance away from the city."—Evangelism, p. 79.

    List the three largest social groups in the city in which, or
 near which, you live. Which ministries would be relevant in
 reaching them with the gospel? How can you involve yourself in
 one or more of these ministries?

                                                                       93

FURTHER STUDY: Decide which of the following texts are an ex-
ample of friendship evangelism, house evangelism, worship evangelism,
and urban evangelism: 1 Kings 17; Jonah 1:1, 2; John 1:43-46; Daniel 3.
   Also read any or all of the following: Christian Service, "Christian
Help Work" pp. 186-193; Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, pp. 21,
22; Counsels on Sabbath School Work, "The Importance and Purpose
of Sabbath School Work" pp. 9-14; Gospel Workers, "Preaching Christ"
pp. 156-160; Evangelism, "The Metropolitan Masses" pp. 25-44.

   "Visit your neighbors in a friendly way, and become acquainted
with them."—Welfare Ministry, p. 78.


 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How can you demonstrate practical Christianity to your neigh-
     bors? Think of at least two areas where your help or presence
     would be welcome. Then go and do!

     2. What discussion topics in a small group might attract the
        interest of "unchurched" people? What topics may not attract
        them? Explain your answers. How can you incorporate your
        answers into a ministry?

     3. Should announcements be part of the worship service? Is pro-
        motion appropriate as part of the sermon? Is it appropriate to
        use the worship service for evangelistic purposes? Explain
        your answers.

     4. List at least three differences between evangelism in urban
        areas and evangelism in rural areas. What approaches may be
        used in urban areas to "penetrate" apartment buildings?

SUMMARIZE this week's lesson by answering the following questions
in your own words: (1) When and where did the early Christians wit-
ness? (2) What does the answer to the first question teach us about the
"when" and "where" of witnessing? (3) List and describe the times and
places of witnessing that this week's lesson discussed in detail.
(4) What will you do differently regarding witnessing as a result of what
you have learned this week?

                        Gems in the Mud
                             J. H. Zachary

    Jason was nearing graduation from a university in Papua New
Guinea. He was confident that he would find a good job. Then two
things happened that changed his life.
    Jason attended some evangelistic meetings and became convinced
of God's claim upon his life. He surrendered his life to the Lord.
    Following graduation Jason began searching for work. But with
only 30 percent of the population in Papua New Guinea employed, few
employers were willing to honor his request for Sabbaths off.
    Jason asked God what he should do, and God answered. Jason was
convinced that God was calling him to share his faith among the
islands that dot the southern coastline of Papua New Guinea, a chal-
lenging and largely unentered area. Small villages dot tiny islands that
barely stand above the mud and water. The people suffer health
problems from their environment, and most cannot read or write. The
majority have never heard the good news about Jesus.
    With only his Bible and the clothes he wore, Jason journeyed to his
island mission field. In the first village he made the people an offer. "If
you will provide me with food and shelter and transportation costs, I
will teach you how to read." The villagers agreed.
    Using his Bible as a reading textbook, Jason set up class. Villagers
flocked to learn how to read. And as the light of literacy dawned on
them, the light of Bible truths dispelled their spiritual darkness.
    Soon Jason began Bible studies, and a number of villagers made
decisions to follow Christ. When a small group of believers was firmly
established in this village, Jason moved on to the next island village,
 where he repeated his offer with equal success.
    A mission worker learned of the work Jason was doing and asked
 him, "What supplies do you have for your work?"
     Jason answered, "I have my Bible."
    "What else?" the man wanted to know.
    "I have Jesus."
     The pastor emptied his case of all the books and gave them to Jason
 to enrich his teaching. Jason now receives a small stipend for his work.
 He is preparing some 500 people for baptism in the island villages of
 southern Papua New Guinea. Pray for him and for the people he
 ministers to in this land of spiritual hunger.

   J. H. Zachary is coordinator of international evangelism for The Quiet
 Hour and a special consultant for the General Conference Ministerial
 Association.

      Errors and Setbacks in
           Witnessing




Sabbath Afternoon
A MAJOR ERROR IN WITNESSING. In contrasting Paul's experi-
ence in Corinth with that in Athens (Acts 17; 1 Cor. 2:2), Ellen G. White
wrote, "Instead of indulging in poetic descriptions and fanciful represen-
tations, which might please the senses and feed the imagination, but
which would not touch the daily experience, Paul sought by the use of
simple language to bring home to the heart the truths that are of vital
importance. . . . The immediate needs, the present trials, of struggling
souls—these must be met with sound, practical instruction in the funda-
mental principles of Christianity."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 252.
   A major setback in apostolic days was persecution, generally founded
on false charges (see Acts 5:28; 14:4; 16:20, 21; 17:6; 17:18; 18:13;
19:26, 27). However, persecution often has motivated Christians to be
more committed to the Lord.
   God helped the early Christians to overcome errors, setbacks, ob-
stacles, fears, and opposition. As you study this week's lesson, always
remember that He gives us the same help.

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE:
  I. Ethnic Divisions (Acts 6:1-7).
 11. Dissension Among Witnesses (Acts 13:13; 15:37-40).
I11. Lack of Contextualization (Acts 15; 16:1-3).
IV. Fear of Criticism (Acts 21:17-25).
 V. Language Barriers (Acts 2:4-11; 14:8-18).

MEMORY TEXT: "They returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,
strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to con-
tinue in the faith, and saying, 'We must through many tribula-
tions enter the kingdom of God'" (Acts 14:21, 22, NKJV).

ETHNIC DIVISIONS (Acts 6:1-7).

   Read Acts 6:1-7 to help you fill in the chart below.What conclusions
can you draw from this example about how to deal with ethnic divi-
sions?


  The Problem       The Solution      The Result        Conclusions




   The early Christian church was bicultural. The Hellenists, or Grecian
Jews, were non-native-born Jews whose first language was Greek
rather than Hebrew. However, native-born Jews comprised the top
leadership of the church.
   Luke described the complaint as a class discrimination offense.
Neither he nor the apostles offered a defense for it. Instead, they im-
mediately set out to find a solution. The fact that they called a congre-
gational meeting shows that they realized the problem was serious.
   Moses' appointment of the seventy (Num. 11:10-16) to better care
for the Israelites may have offered the apostles an example. They
advised expanding the leadership by involving other church members.
Interestingly, all seven people elected to office bear Greek names.
These appointments suggest the church's progress toward resolving
tensions caused by culture and race.
   "The influence of the gospel is to unite God's people in one great
brotherhood. . . . Worldly maxims and differences of nationalities are
lost sight of in him. The love of God, sanctifying the soul, breaks
down the wall of partition between the customs and practices of
different individuals and nations. The great principles of Bible truth
bring all into perfect harmony."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald,
November 3, 1885, p. 559.

    What is my local congregation doing to express to the community
 that we belong to one great family? How can we improve upon what
 we are doing? What can I do to help any improvement to occur?

                                                                      97

DISSENSION AMONG WITNESSES (Acts 13:13; 15:37-40).

     What problem led to a clash among the apostles?

     Acts 13:13


     15:37-40

   John Mark, "overwhelmed with fear and discouragement, wavered
for a time in his purpose to give himself wholeheartedly to the Lord's
work. Unused to hardships, he was disheartened by the perils and
privations of the way. He had labored with success under favorable
circumstances; but now, amidst the opposition and perils that so often
beset the pioneer worker, he failed to endure hardness as a good soldier
of the cross. He had yet to learn to face danger and persecution and
adversity with a brave heart. As the apostles advanced, and still greater
difficulties were apprehended, Mark was intimidated and, losing all
courage, refused to go farther and returned to Jerusalem."—The Acts of
the Apostles, pp. 169, 170.
   As a result of a sharp disagreement with Barnabas over John Mark,
Paul chose Silas to accompany him instead and began a mission
through Syria and Cilicia (Acts 15:40, 41). The result was that there
were now two missions, not just one. The church still understood that
they were doing God's work and commended them "unto the grace of
God" (v. 40). Thus we learn that we can have unity of purpose even
when there is diversity of opinions and strategies.
   Mark had the blessing of being close to Barnabas, who worked
patiently on his behalf. Eventually Mark developed into a valuable
worker.

  What principles may have led Paul to reconsider his attitude toward
Mark?


     Phil. 2:1, 2


     Phil. 4:2


   Is there dissension among members in your church? How can these
principles and what happened to Paul, Barnabas, and John Mark
assist in helping to alleviate the situation? If you are involved in any
way in the dissension, how can you apply these principles to your life?

LACK OF CONTEXTUAL IZATION (Acts 15; 16:1-3).



    DEFINITION: Contextualization is the process of making
    the gospel meaningful and applicable to a given society.
    From an Adventist perspective, contextualization is not re-
    lated to the content of the gospel but to the forms in which it
    is presented. Any contextualization must preserve intact the
    twenty-seven fundamental beliefs of the denomination.


   "When, as you labor in a place, you see that the scales are begin-
ning to fall from men's eyes . . . be very careful not to present the truth
in such a way as to arouse prejudice and close the door of the heart to
further light. Agree with the people on every point where you can
consistently do so. Let them see that you love their souls, and want to
be in harmony with them as far as possible."—Ellen G. White, The
Review and Herald, June 13, 1912, p. 255.
    A good example of contextualization is found in Acts 15. What was
the problem? Why did it exist? How did the church members deal with
it? This incident is known as the Jerusalem Council and presents an
example for the church today. What conclusions about contextualizaton
can we draw from this example?

   Why did Paul circumcise Timothy? Acts 16:1-3.


   At Pentecost, when the gospel was presented in cultural forms
appropriate to each group present, God showed that He respects our
variety of cultures and languages. Paul, too, was willing to be flexible on
issues that would not affect the truths of the gospel (1 Cor. 9:19-22).
   Cultural practices vary from country to country. In some parts of the
world, it is unthinkable to attend church without wearing shoes. In
other parts of the world, church members remove their shoes before
entering the sanctuary. Other practices include what color churches are
painted, the wearing of ties, sitting on the floor, and which musical
instruments may be used. We may vary in such practices, but we must
agree on the essential elements of Christ's gospel.

    What cultural practices regarding worship exist in your part
 of the world? Should you or should you not observe the cultural
 practices in a part of the world you are visiting? Explain your
 answer. Who should make decisions regarding the cultural prac-
 tices manifested in a local church, and why?

                                                                        99
Wednesday                                           September 13
FEAR OF CRITICISM (Acts 21:17-25).

   Once again Paul found himself in Jerusalem where the elders of the
church received him warmly. How pleased he must have been to inform
them of how readily many Gentiles had accepted the gospel as a result
of his ministry to them. Yet this news proved to be at the center of a
major problem, because "many thousands of Jews" also believed,
"and all of them are zealous for the law" (Acts 21:20, NIV). These
Jewish converts had heard rumors that Paul had advised Christian
Jews who lived with Christian Gentiles to forsake certain traditions of
their ancestral faith.

  What did the church leaders in Jerusalem ask Paul to do in order to
quiet the rumors and the fears of the Hebrew converts? What was
wrong with their request, and how did it go against what the Jerusalem
Council had decided? (see Acts 15:1, 2, 6-11, 19-21, 28). See also
Acts 21:20-25.


   "Paul thought that he was doing a wise thing in being a Jew among
Jews (1 Cor. 9:19-23). But actually he was inconsistent here, for he
participated, not to reveal his own belief, but to satisfy others who were
`zealous of the law.' "—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 405.

   What happened as a result of Paul's participation? Acts 21:26-39.


   "The Jerusalem leaders believed that the advice they were giving
was for the best. There was no intent to involve Paul in trouble, but
rather to counteract the prejudice against him, for which they seemed to
think he was in some way to blame. . . . They should rather have
recognized that God had worked mightily through Paul, and endeav-
ored, themselves, to counteract the opposition to him."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 6, p. 404.
   Administrators, teachers, elders, evangelists, pastors, and church
leaders in general are subject to criticism and gossip. Attempts to
change traditions, try new methods, or alter the establishment may
produce bitter reactions. Criticism and false accusations feed on each
other and can often create a fire storm that, once started, is difficult to
extinguish. Such heat can cause people to draw rash conclusions and
make unwise decisions.

   What fire storms fueled by criticism exist in your part of the
world church? How can you help to put them out? List at least
three ways we can prevent such storms.

LANGUAGE BARRIERS (Acts 2:4-11; 14:8-18).

  What did the people of Lystra do when Paul and Barnabas did not
understand what they were saying? Acts 14:11.


    Paul and Barnabas went to Lystra to flee from an attempted stoning
in Iconium (Acts 14:1-7). In Lystra, they found a lame man whose faith
was strong enough to respond to God's healing grace and who in turn
was healed (vs. 9, 10). As a result, the people shouted praise in their
native Lycaonian tongue (v. 11). Paul and Barnabas did not at first
understand them (see SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 297). Now, as
then, language can be a barrier.
    It was logical for the Lycaonians to have reacted in their native
tongue, because most people who speak more than one language
consider their native tongue to be the "language of the heart." They
pray and make decisions for eternity in that language. If we witness to
others who speak more than one language, we should share the gospel
with them in their "language of the heart."

   What was God's first solution to language barriers? Acts 2:4-11.


   Some Christians feel that congregations with different language
groups are evidence of division. However, on the day of Pentecost,
God Himself enabled the Christian community to preach in different
languages and still be of "one accord" (Acts 2:1, 44). Paul was able to
cross language and cultural boundaries without making reference to
either language as a dividing factor. Paul stressed unity, but unity does
not mean uniformity.

     Many towns and cities of our world are fast becoming centers
 where people from different countries, cultures, and languages
 meet and live. What languages do people speak in your area? How
 is your church planning to reach them with the gospel? Which of
 the following approaches could help them to understand the gos-
 pel in their language?

       A Sabbath School class and Bible Study Guide in their language
       Other literature in their language
       A small group in their neighborhood
       Translation of church services
       A church whose services are held in their language
       Other

                                                                     101
Friday                                             September 15
FURTHER STUDY: In Wednesday's lesson, we learned how criti-
cism and gossip can cause setbacks in witnessing. What else does
Scripture say about criticism and gossip? Exod. 20:16; Lev. 19:16; Ps.
15:1-3; James 1:26.
   Also read Christian Service, "Assurance of Success" pp. 257-265;
Evangelism, "Meeting Prejudice and Opposition" pp. 301-306; Gos-
pel Workers, "In Relation with One Another" pp. 473-504.

   "Often, as you seek to present the truth, opposition will be aroused;
but if you seek to meet the opposition with argument you will only
multiply it, and that you cannot afford to do. Hold to the affirmative.
Angels of God are watching you, and they understand how to impress
those whose opposition you refuse to meet with argument. Dwell not
on the negative points of questions that arise, but gather to your minds
affirmative truths, and fasten them there by much study and earnest
prayer and heart consecration. . . .
   "If Christ had not held to the affirmative in the wilderness of tempta-
tion, He would have lost all that He desired to gain. Christ's way is the
best way to meet our opponents. We strengthen their arguments when
we repeat what they say. Keep always to the affirmative. It may be that
the very man who is opposing you will carry your words home and be
converted to the sensible truth that has reached his understanding."
—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, pp. 147, 148.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. In the early days of Christianity many believed that Gentiles
     should become Jews in order to be saved. Should Jews today be
     required to become Gentiles in order to be accepted in the
     Christian church? Or could they still celebrate the ancestral
     festivals? Explain your answer. (See Acts 18:18; 20:16).

   2. List other errors and setbacks that hinder our witnessing. How
      might we avoid these errors and setbacks?

SUMMARIZE this week's lesson by listing the errors and setbacks of
witnessing that it discussed. How can we resist these obstacles?
   How has this week's lesson strengthened your desire to improve
upon the witnessing opportunities God gives you?
   As you witness to others during the coming days and weeks, remem-
ber that the early Christians were not exempt from making mistakes.
They learned by trial and error. God, however, gave them wisdom and
power to overcome obstacles. In the midst of persecution, they prayed
for boldness, and despite their great diversity, they preserved unity.

             The Dream That Would Not Die
                             Danilo Bada

    I was born into a Manobo family in the southern Philippines. We
lived in treehouses for protection against enemies.
    When a logging company came to harvest timber, it established a
school for the loggers' children. I learned of the school and begged my
parents to let me enroll so I could learn to read. My parents permitted
me to study at the school until it closed two years later.
    There was no other school in the region, but I had tasted the
sweetness of knowledge, and I wanted to learn more. So when I was 9
years old I set out to find a school without telling my parents. I walked
through the mountain forests, staying away from the trails where I
might meet someone from an enemy tribe. At night I slept in trees.
Finally I arrived in Butuan City. I found a school and asked a teacher if
I could study there. When the teacher realized that I was a Manobo and
how determined I was to attend school, she let me stay in her home and
work to pay my tuition.
     During high school I met a colporteur who introduced me to Jesus
Christ. I began selling literature to pay my school fees. I eventually
completed a master's degree in public health. As the only Manobo in
the Philippines with an MPH, I could have any job I wanted, but I was
determined to return to the mountains and teach my own people.
     I arrived home and found my tribal land unoccupied. I knew that if
I did not claim the land, it would go to someone else. I built a simple
school, and soon some 60 students enrolled. I needed help; I wrote to
Mountain View College and asked for a student missionary to come
and teach.
     Jessica Hermoso volunteered. She made her way alone into the
 mountains and found the little mission school. She is a natural teacher,
and the children love her. But then rebel soldiers invaded the area, and
 it became too dangerous for Jessica or the students to remain. She
 returned to her home, and I remained to farm my family's land.
     In 1997 I met Jessica again, and eventually we were married. When
 it was safe to return, we reopened the school. We have added a second
 school in a nearby village, and we are erecting more permanent
 buildings as funds become available. Other villages have asked us to
 teach their children, but we have no money to hire teachers. My dream
 for an education refused to die. In fact, it has grown far beyond what I
 ever could have imagined.

   Danilo and Jessica Bada work with the Manobo people in the southern
Philippines.

      Postwitnessing Activities




Sabbath Afternoon
"CLOSE THE BACK DOOR!" Baptism opens the front door to mem-
bership in the church. Witnessing aims to "make disciples." If this goal
is not met, many new members will sooner or later leave through the
back door.
   What happens after baptism is crucial to "making disciples" and
usually is more relevant to retaining newly baptized persons than what
happened before. It is important, therefore, to identify how we can close
the back door.
   1. Establish a concrete discipleship program. Proper follow-up will
help new members to mature in the faith and become actively involved
in church life.
   2. Help new members establish and maintain personal relationships
with mature members. The more new members develop a sense of
belonging, the less likely they will leave.
   Whether you are newly baptized or a mature member, ask yourself
the following questions as you study this week's lesson: How can I
help my church develop an effective follow-up program, and what can I
do to help establish a sense of belonging for everyone in the church?

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE:
  I. Follow-up (Acts 14:21-23; 15:36; 18:23).
 11. Establishing New Members (Acts 13:43; 18:8-11).
HI. Discipleship (Acts 11:25, 26, 29, 30).
IV. Leadership Training (Acts 20:13-36; 14:23).
 V. Nurturing Churches (Acts 15:40, 41; 16:4, 5).

MEMORY TEXT: "And after he had spent some time there, he
departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in
order, strengthening all the disciples" (Acts 18:23).

FOLLOW-UP (Acts 14:21-23; 15:36; 18:23).

   In Paul's first missionary journey, he and Barnabas visited several
urban centers: Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, and Derbe. Antiochians "ex-
pelled them out of their coasts" (Acts 13:50). In Inconium, both Jews
and Gentiles tried to "abuse and stone them," so they fled from there
(14:5, 6, NKJV). Paul was actually stoned at Lystra, under the instiga-
tion of Jews from Antioch and Iconium (14:19). From there he went to
Derbe (14:20).

   Where did he and Barnabas go after preaching at Derbe? What did
they emphasize during the rest of their missionary journey? Acts
14:21-23. What does Paul and Barnabas's willingness to return to
areas that had so recently proven dangerous to their well-being teach
us about the importance of their emphasis?


   If Paul and Barnabas had pushed forward, instead of retracing their
steps, in a week or so they could have arrived in Tarsus, Paul's home-
town. Why, then, would they do such a thing as return to enemy
territory? Returning so soon to these hotbeds of enemy opposition
must have taken a great deal of courage.
   In Antioch, almost the whole city had attended Sabbath services
(Acts 13:44). In Iconium, "a great multitude both of Jews and also of the
Greeks believed" (14:1). In Derbe they had "made many disciples"
(14:21, NKJV). The apostle knew the importance of what we call "follow-
up."
   "After the first efforts have been made in a place by giving a course
of lectures, there is really greater necessity for a second course than for
the first."—Evangelism, p. 334. This is exactly what Paul and Barnabas
had in mind when they decided to risk retracing their steps.

  What was one of the reasons for Paul's second missionary jour-
ney? Acts 15:36.


   What was the purpose of the third missionary journey? Acts 18:23.


    What do you think your part might be in assisting new mem-
 bers? Based on Paul's experience, we must remember that doing
 so can be difficult at times. Jesus' life and death, however, teach
 us that we must always be ready to guide recent converts through
 what to them is still uncharted water. How might you help them
 "navigate" their way through the first year beyond baptism?

ESTABLISHING NEW MEMBERS (Acts 13:43; 18:8-11).

   According to the mission model of Romans 10:13-15, Paul was
sent and then he preached. Then many heard, believed, and were
baptized. But he did not stop there.

   What did Paul do for the newly baptized according to Acts 13:43 and
18:11 (compare Matt. 28:19, 20).


    The following are suggestions for establishing new members:
    1. Friendship with other members is the first step toward a new
member's assimilation into the church. Many newly baptized persons
do not feel a sense of belonging to the congregation of which they are
members. Remember that, according to experts, each new member
should have a minimum of seven new friends in the church within the
first six months; otherwise they will be on their way out the back door.
(See Win Arn, The Church Ratio Book, p. 23.)
    2. Assign them responsibilities. "Everyone who is added to the ranks
by conversion is to be assigned his post of duty."—Testimonies for the
Church, vol. 7, p. 30.
    3. Invite new members to participate on the platform. They can
easily announce an opening song, perform a musical selection, have
Scripture reading and prayer, etc. "The elders and those who have
leading places in the church . . . should arrange matters so that every
member of the church shall have a part to act."—Christian Service,
p. 62.
    4. Ask a new member to share the privilege with a mature member
of giving Bible studies to a new interest. "The more he seeks to impart
light, the more light he will receive. The more one tries to explain the
word of God to others, with a love for souls, the plainer it becomes to
himself. The more we use our knowledge and exercise our powers, the
more knowledge and power we shall have."—Christ's Object Les-
sons, p. 354.
    5. Invite new members to accompany experienced members during
visitation. "Many would be willing to work if they were taught how to
begin. They need to be instructed and encouraged. Every church should
be a training school for Christian workers."—The Ministry of Healing,
p. 149.
    6. Encourage them to bring others to church. "The spirit of Christ is
a missionary spirit. The very first impulse of the renewed heart is to
bring others also to the Saviour."—The Great Controversy, p. 70.

   What basic devotional habits should newly baptized mem-
 bers learn? Who other than the pastor should teach them? When?

DISCIPLESHIP (Acts 11:25, 26, 29, 30).

   According to the first recorded attempt to reach Gentiles, "a great
number [of Greek-speaking residents of Antioch] believed and turned to
the Lord" (Acts 11:19-21). Antioch was then known as one of the "eyes" of
Asia in the Roman Empire, and a Roman prefect was garrisoned there to
secure Roman power in the area. "The city was ranked third in prominence
to Rome and Alexandria. . . . Ritual prostitution in the temple of Daphne
characterized the sensual orientation of the morals of the city."—Ogilvie,
Acts: The Communicator's Commentary, p. 194.

  What specific form of ministry did Paul and Barnabas develop for a
whole year in Antioch? Acts 11:25, 26.

   The NRSV reads, "So it was that for an entire year they met with the
church and taught a great many people." When we consider the nature
of Antioch, we realize even more the need for such training. As a result
of these training sessions, the members of this newly established
church became so actively identified with Christ that soon they were
known as "Christians." "The name was given because Christ was the
main theme of their preaching, their teaching, and their conversation."
—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 157.
   The Antioch experience in developing a proper follow-up program
for newly baptized members sets a pattern for a comprehensive ap-
proach to evangelism. "Every church should be a training school for
Christian workers. Its members should be taught how to give Bible
readings [or Bible studies], how to conduct and teach Sabbath-school
classes, how best to help the poor and to care for the sick, how to work
for the unconverted. There should be schools of health, cooking classes,
and classes in various lines of Christian help work."—The Ministry of
Healing, p. 149.

  Who received the offerings sent by the members in Antioch? Acts
11:29, 30.


   Apparently, the apostles had trained elders to take over the leader-
ship of the local congregations in Judea. The apostles had previously
requested assistance in order to have more time for other ministries
(Acts 6:3, 4).

    Based on the nature of the area where you live, what types of
 discipleship training are most needed? How can you be a part of
 some of these programs?

                                                                      107

LEADERSHIP TRAINING (Acts 20:13-36; 14:23).

   For what purpose did Paul call a meeting in Miletus? Whom did he
invite? Acts 20:13-36. If you had been one of the elders in attendance,
how might Paul's words have encouraged you?


   Organization of church life in Ephesus appears to have been rela-
tively simple. When Paul departed after the riot described in the previ-
ous chapter, he exhorted the "disciples" (Acts 20:1). From Miletus, he
sent for the Ephesian elders (20:17). Probably each of them would have
been in charge of a congregation meeting in someone's home. In Acts,
there are many speeches directed to evangelize nonbelievers, but this is
the only example in Acts of Paul teaching the church leaders. His
charge to the elders identified them as "overseers" (v. 28) or "bishops"
or "guardians."
    In his speech, Paul reminded the elders of the following: "(i) He
reminded them of their duty. They were overseers of the flock of God.
That was not a duty they had chosen but a duty for which they had
been chosen. The servants of the Good Shepherd must also be shep-
herds of the sheep. (ii) He reminded them of their danger. The infection
of the world is never far away. Where truth is, falsehood ever attacks.
There was a constant warfare ahead to keep the faith intact and the
Church pure.
   "Through all this scene runs the dominant feeling of an affection as
deep as the heart itself. That feeling should be in every church; for
when love dies in any church the work of Christ cannot do other than
wither."—Barclay, The Acts of the Apostles, p. 152.

  With what action did Paul finish his ministry in Lystra, Iconium,
and Antioch? Acts 14:23.


   The most concrete, lasting form of ministry in Acts is church plant-
ing. Planting churches is more than establishing a meeting place or
baptizing a group of believers. Only when leaders are properly func-
tioning can members take the time to participate actively in outreach.
Then the church will grow, and as it grows, it will truly become
planted. This requires leadership training.

   What can members do when no pastor is present in a worship
service? What can pastors do to train members to administer
proper church leadership in their absence? What are some ad-
vantages and disadvantages of pastors having a multichurch
district?

NURTURING CHURCHES (Acts 15:40, 41; 16:4, 5).

  What did Paul do at the start of his second missionary tour?
Acts 15:40, 41.


   Paul started his second missionary tour in the area close to Antioch
and then proceeded to the Galatian region, where he had established
churches during his first missionary journey (Acts 13-14). This short
record suggests that Paul had no intention of making a career of nurtur-
ing those new churches, even though they would have liked him to
stay. However, Paul and Silas kept their visits brief and moved on to the
frontiers as quickly as possible.
   There is no question that new churches need to be nurtured, but we
should remember that "the greatest help that can be given our people is
to teach them to work for God, and to depend on Him, not on the
ministers."—Christian Service, p. 58.
   It is true that from time to time we all will need help and encour-
agement from a fellow Christian. Paul counsels us in Galatians 6:2 to
"carry each other's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of
Christ" (NIV). At the same time, however, we also must remember
that ultimately our strength depends solely on Jesus Christ and the
connection we have with Him. Human strength by its very nature is
subject to human frailties and will at times fail. The final conclusion
then is this: While at times we will need encouragement from others,
and while we all should learn how to be an encouragement to others,
our greatest need is to learn how to depend on Christ alone and how to
direct others to depend on Him.

  What results did Paul and Silas receive for their efforts? Acts
16:4, 5.

   The overall impression in reading the book of Acts is that the
apostles stayed a relatively short time with most churches. After train-
ing leadership, they continued with their work of evangelization. "The
ministers who are hovering over the churches, preaching to those who
know the truth, would better go into places still in darkness. Unless
they do this, they themselves and their congregations will become
dwarfed."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, February 9, 1905.

    Might I be demanding too much pastoral attention? How can
 I become stronger in the Lord so that I will require less pastoral
 attention? How can I balance worship, nurture, and outreach in
 my life?

                                                                     109
Friday                                            September 22
FURTHER STUDY: In 1 Thessalonians 5:11, Paul writes, "Encour-
age one another and build each other up" (NIV). Then in verses 12-22,
he lists 15 ways in which we should do so. What are these 15 ways?
Think of specific ways you can fulfill each one.
   Read any or all of the following: Evangelism, "Establishing and
Holding New Converts" pp. 334-383; Gospel Workers, "Thoroughness"
pp. 367-372; The Acts of the Apostles, "Exalting the Cross" pp. 205-207.

   "After individuals have been converted to the truth, they need to be
looked after. The zeal of many ministers seems to fail as soon as a
measure of success attends their efforts. They do not realize that these
newly converted ones need nursing—watchful attention, help, and
encouragement. . . . Preaching is a small part of the work to be done
for the salvation of souls. God's Spirit convicts sinners of the truth,
and He places them in the arms of the church. The ministers may do
their part, but they can never perform the work that the church should
do."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, pp. 68, 69.
   "The elders and those who have leading places in the church should
give more thought to their plans for conducting the work. They should
arrange matters so that every member of the church shall have a part to
act, that none may lead an aimless life, but that all may accomplish what
they can according to their several ability."—Christian Service, p. 62.
    "Every true disciple is born into the kingdom of God as a mission-
ary. He who drinks of the living water becomes a fountain of life. The
receiver becomes a giver."—Christian Service, p. 9.

                   The Lame Man Walks
                        J. H. Zachary

    Babu Rao was a faithful and devoted young Hindu. He per-
formed the ceremonies of his religion and refused to have any-
thing to do with Christianity. Often he made unkind remarks to
Christians when they tried to speak to him of their faith.
    Then Rao became ill with a mysterious affliction that paralyzed
him from the waist down. Even specialists in a large hospital could
not help the paralyzed man. His family took him to sacred Hindu
sites hoping that Rao would regain his health, but nothing hap-
pened. Family members offered sacrifices of pigs, goats, and black
chickens at another sacred temple, but still Rao felt no relief.
    Unable to walk, Babu Rao had time to think about his future. A
Christian friend stopped by to encourage him and to tell Rao that
he and his family were praying for him. Touched, Rao asked him,
"Can the Christian's God help me?"
    "Jehovah God is able to do things that other gods and even
doctors cannot do," his friend answered. Rao thanked his friend
and invited him to come back to visit and pray for him again.
    The Christian friend told his congregation about Rao and urged
them to pray for him. For two months the believers held special
services for Rao, during which the pastor and members fasted and
prayed for this Hindu man.
    Rao began to regain feeling in his right leg. Soon he could place
his weight on that leg. As feeling returned to his left leg, Babu Rao
began to walk with the aid of crutches. As soon as possible, he
attended services at the Adventist church. During a prayer meeting
Rao stood and told the members, "I regret the way I spoke to you
 in the past. Please forgive me. I have learned that Jesus is the true
God."
     Babu Rao, the man who stubbornly opposed Christians, ac-
 cepted salvation through Christ and was baptized. He now walks
 with no need of canes or crutches, a testimony to God's mighty
 healing power. He has shared his testimony with family and friends,
 and many of them have begun attending church with him.
     Babu Rao is not unique. As Hindus in India experience difficul-
 ties in their lives that their traditional deities cannot solve, they
 often are willing to listen to Christians. This opens the way for
 millions to accept Jesus Christ as their Saviour.

   The Results of Witnessing




Sabbath Afternoon
WHAT A REWARD! "The redeemed will meet and recognize those
whose attention they have directed to the uplifted Saviour. What blessed
converse they will have with these souls! `I was a sinner,' it will be said,
`without God and without hope in the world; and you came to me, and
drew my attention to the precious Saviour as my only hope. . . .'
   "Others will say: 'I was a heathen in heathen lands. You left your
friends and comfortable home, and came to teach me how to find Jesus,
and believe in Him as the only true God. I demolished my idols, and
worshiped God, and now I see Him face to face. . . .'
   "Others will express their gratitude to those who fed the hungry and
clothed the naked. 'When despair bound my soul in unbelief, the Lord
sent you to me,' they say, 'to speak words of hope and comfort. You
brought me food for my physical necessities, and you opened to me
the word of God, awakening me to my spiritual needs. . . . My heart
was softened, subdued, broken, as I contemplated the sacrifice which
Christ had made for me.' "—Gospel Workers, pp. 518, 519.
    As we study this week's lesson, let us keep before us the rewards of
witnessing for our Savior, rewards that we can enjoy both now and for eternity.

FAILURE? (Acts 17:32-34).

   Describe the results of Paul's mission in Athens. Acts 17:32-34.


    People rejected Paul's message on many occasions. In some in-
stances, as in Athens, he did not see large groups becoming Christians.
His work there is used many times as an example of faulty evangelistic
strategies, but the record indicates that some people did believe.
    One of the people who did accept Christ at Athens was Dionysius, a
member of the Areopagus. The Areopagus was an honored court of
justice that held jurisdiction over certain crimes, religious offenses
among them. The Areopagus also licensed teachers and controlled
education.
    Another person mentioned as having accepted Christ at Athens was a
woman named Damaris. Because women in Athens were restricted, no
respectable woman would have been in the marketplace listening to Paul.
It is likely, therefore, that upon hearing him, she turned from a life of ill
repute to one of righteousness. Imagine for a moment the number of
people whom just these two converts probably influenced for eternity!

   What do the following verses teach us about failure versus success
in witnessing? Luke 15:3-24; John 4:7-26, 28-30, 39-41.

   Despite what we view as a setback, we must remember that soul-
winning work is God's work. Feelings of personal failure or success
have no have place in it. Failure is doing nothing; but "when we give
ourselves wholly to God, and in our work follow His directions, He
makes Himself responsible for its accomplishment. He would not have
us conjecture as to the success of our honest endeavors. Not once
should we even think of failure. We are to co-operate with One who
knows no failure."—Christian Service, pp. 261, 262.
   "Workers for Christ are never to think, much less speak, of failure in
their work."—Page 261.
   We will, however, care about the results, because "the results do not
end with this life, but reach over into eternity."—Testimonies for the
Church, vol. 5, p. 411. We always will do our best in order to maximize
the results, remembering that even though in soul winning there is a
combination of human and divine efforts, conversion is always a miracle
from God.

   Think of some people who have accepted the gospel as a
 result of your witnessing. Remember some who rejected the
 gospel. Can you think of some who have not accepted it yet?
 Pray for all of them now!

                                                                         113

OBJECTIONS AND EXCUSES (Acts 22:12-16; 24:25; 26:27, 28).

   How did Ananias encourage Saul to make an immediate deci-
sion to accept Christ? Acts 22:16.


   Paul's conversion involved a twofold commitment.
   1.He committed himself to Jesus on the Damascus road, immediately
referring to Jesus as "Lord."
   2. He committed himself to the body of Christ through baptism in
the city of Damascus.
   Before making either of these two commitments, people often present
objections and excuses. The devil uses objections and excuses as "iron
bands" to hinder people from making their decision for what is true.
"Many are convinced that we have the truth, and yet they are held as
with iron bands; they dare not risk the consequences of taking their
position on the side of truth. . . . Just at this critical period Satan throws
the strongest bands around these souls."—Testimonies for the Church,
vol. 1, p. 646.

   What excuse did Felix give to Paul when confronted with the issue of
eternal consequences? Acts 24:25. King Agrippa? 26:27, 28. What
can we learn about witnessing from Paul's response to Agrippa?
Verse 29.


   Felix's wife Drusilla had been married to Azizus, King of Emesa. But
Felix had charmed her away from her first husband. It is no surprise
then, that when Paul began to speak about "righteousness, self-control
and the judgment to come" (24:25, NIV), Felix dismissed him. One
way of knowing we have succeeded in making the gospel personal is
when someone makes an excuse, and then an exit.
   As stated earlier in this Bible Study Guide, an objection is an honest
block to a strong decision. The soul winner cannot secure a decision until
the block is removed. An excuse is an attempt to avoid making a
decision. A good way to learn a person's objection is by asking the
prospect to read Acts 22:16 and then ask the person, "Is there any reason
why you would not make a decision to follow Jesus right now?" Then
wait in prayerful silence. If the prospect answers No, both the witness
and the prospect may join in a prayer of thanksgiving. But if the prospect
offers some objections, the witness may ask, "Is that the only reason?"
Usually the last objection is the most important.

   "I am too busy." "I am not ready." "I will do it later." What
 are my excuses for not serving as a witness today?

ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION (Acts 28:23, 24).

  Review and describe the attitudes of Felix and Agrippa to Paul's
appeals.

  Acts 24:25

   26:27, 28

   "When persons who are under conviction are not brought to make a
decision at the earliest period possible, there is danger that the convic-
tion will gradually wear away."—Evangelism, p. 229.

  How did some of the people respond to Paul's evidence of the gospel?
Acts 28:23, 24.

   From the first proclamation of the gospel found in the book of Acts
(Acts 2) to the last (Acts 28), we find that when the gospel was
preached to unbelievers, some accepted it, while others did not.
   When the Christian witness notices that the student does not accept
a doctrine just studied, one option is to move to another subject. Many
issues will find spontaneous answers while other doctrines are being
studied. Of course, the witness must pray harder, asking the Holy Spirit
to bring conviction. "The arguments of the apostles alone, though clear
and convincing, would not have removed the prejudice that had with-
stood so much evidence. But the Holy Spirit sent the arguments home
to hearts with divine power."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 45.

   What did the apostles do when people rejected their message? Acts
13:48-52; 14:4-7. What can their attitude teach us about our attitude
regarding the success or supposed failure of our witnessing attempts?

   The acceptance or the rejection of the gospel carries eternal conse-
quences. The Bible often describes these consequences in terms of
contrasting options: life and death, good and evil (Deut. 30:15); bless-
ings and curses (30:19); and a narrow path and broad way (Matt.
7:13,14). For others, read Matthew 7:24-27; 25:2, 33, 46; and Revela-
tion 20:15 and 21:1. Christian witnesses are ambassadors for Christ
who invite sinners to repentance, conversion, baptism, and persever-
ance (see 2 Cor. 5:20; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 22:16; 14:22).

    If your eternal destiny would be decided today, would you be
 saved? How do you know?

WITNESSING AND FINISHING THE WORK (Acts 17:5-7; Rev.
14:6-10).

  What were Christian witnesses accused of in Thessalonica? Acts
17:5-7.


   Explain the relationship between sharing the three angels' mes-
sages with the world and finishing the work. Rev. 14:6-10.


   The book of Acts records many deeds of the early Christians that,
according to their enemies, "turned the world upside down." The Bible
describes in the book of Revelation how the messages of the three
angels are taken to "every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people"
(Rev. 14:6); this means the whole world. The people who share these
messages are not waiting for something extraordinary to take place
some day in the future under the influence of the "latter rain." Many
are already participating in the finishing of God's work by knocking
on doors and giving Bible studies to their friends, neighbors, and
relatives. Others are leaving their families to spend the rest of their
lives witnessing to thousands of people groups.
   How will God finish His work? Through committed members, willing
to sacrifice the conveniences of time, home, town, family, church,
country, and even life itself, to go "to places where the very name of
Christ has not [even] been heard" (Rom. 15:20, NEB). "Servants of
God, with their faces lighted up and shining with holy consecration,
will hasten from place to place to proclaim the message from heaven.
By thousands of voices, all over the earth, the warning will be given.
Miracles will be wrought, the sick will be healed, and signs and
wonders will follow the believers. Satan also works with lying won-
ders even bringing down fire from heaven in the sight of men. Revela-
tion 13:13. Thus the inhabitants of the earth will be brought to take
their stand."—The Great Controversy, p. 612.

   "Evangelistic work, opening the Scriptures to others, warning
men and women of what is coming upon the world, is to occupy
more and still more of the time of God's servants."—Evangelism,
p. 17. Does your witnessing today include "opening the Scriptures
to others"? In addition to giving Bible studies and helping with
evangelistic meetings, think of other ways you can open Scripture
to those in need. Is it possible to open the Scripture to others
without opening it to yourself? Explain.

ETERNAL RESULTS (Acts 28:11-16, 30, 31).

   Under what circumstances did Paul go to Rome? Acts 28:11-16, 30,
31.

   "For years Paul had longed to visit Rome and preach the gospel
there (Rom. 1:11-13). He must have reflected on the sharp contrast
between that eager expectation and the realities of his arrival. But out of
the shocking contrast Paul found reason to take courage, and fresh
assurance of God's leading. Paul was skilled at finding reasons for great
hope in what appeared to be the mose discouraging circumstances. . . .
He was a confirmed and incurable Christian optimist."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 6, p. 461.
   Many times doors to witnessing opportunities seem to close in front
of us. Retirement, serious illness, even the solitude of a prison cell at
first might seem to deny us the chance to witness. However, Paul's
experience teaches us just the opposite.

  How does the book of Acts end? What two words describe the
way Paul witnessed while remaining under house arrest? Acts 28:31.


   In one sense, the book concludes with an enthusiastic spirit of
freedom. To be sure, Paul was a prisoner; but his bonds did not prevent
him from proclaiming the gospel. It is easy for the reader to forget Paul's
chains and to celebrate with him the freedom of the good news.
   In another real sense, the book of Acts does not conclude at all, for
the work goes on through the witnessing of many even today. All of us
involved in whatever facet of witnessing are carrying on the great
legacy handed down to us through the ages by our sisters and brothers
in the early church. Let us all work together, so the mission can be all
that God intends.
   The same Jesus is still standing at the right hand of God, absent from
believers in the flesh yet present with them in the Spirit. This same
Spirit, who moved upon the church at Pentecost, is moving upon the
church today. The acts of the apostles will not conclude until Christ's
followers have fulfilled their great commission and they, along with
those they helped to save, will be swept into the heavens at the Second
Coming.

    The rewards of witnessing are both present and future. What
 a joy it will be to see and to greet in heaven those whom we have
 brought to Jesus and His salvation! What a joy it will be to hear
 the Lord say, "Well done!"

                                                                       117
Friday                                              September 29
FURTHER STUDY: Regarding the rewards of witnessing, read Paul's
testimony in 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18. Also read 1 John 3:1-3.
   Read any or all of the following: Christian Service, "Reward of
Service" pp. 267-275; Gospel Workers, "The Reward of Service" pp.
512-519; Evangelism, "The Message Triumphant" pp. 692-707.

   "The great purpose that constrained Paul to press forward in the
face of hardship and difficulty should lead every Christian worker to
consecrate himself wholly to God's service. Worldly attractions will be
presented to draw his attention from the Saviour, but he is to press on
toward the goal, showing to the world, to angels, and to men that the
hope of seeing the face of God is worth all the effort and sacrifice that
the attainment of this hope demands.
   "Though he was a prisoner, Paul was not discouraged. Instead, a
note of triumph rings through the letters that he wrote from Rome to the
churches. 'Rejoice in the Lord alway,' he wrote to the Philippians, 'and
again I say, Rejoice...
   " 'My God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory
by Christ Jesus. . . . The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.'
[Phil. 4:19, 23]."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 484.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What attitudes should Christians avoid when someone with
     whom they have been studying rejects the gospel? What can
     Christians do to continue a relationship with that person?

   2. What aspects of witnessing are necessary in order to "finish
      the work" in the area where you live? List three groups of
      people among whom you could be an effective witness according
      to your spiritual gifts.

   3. How have this quarter's studies helped your spiritual life?
      What more do you need to know about soul winning? How
      can you and other interested persons in the church receive
      additional training?

SUMMARIZE in your own words the rewards of witnessing. What
concept of success or failure should we have when we witness, and
why? Explain the relationship that exists between witnessing and fin-
ishing the work.
   After studying the lessons this quarter, would you like to make a
commitment to serve God as a witness to His love? If you answer Yes,
pray to God now that He will help you to do so. Ask Him to give you an
opportunity to implement what you have learned throughout these 14
weeks.

                      Show Us God's Power
                              Denis Patin&

    Mali is virtually an unentered country, with fewer than 500
Adventists in a population of 10 million. Mali is a large, landlocked
country located in the bulge of Africa. Most of the people are Muslim
or animist, but in spite of this, people are willing to listen to the gospel,
and many are accepting Christianity.
    We planned an evangelistic series in one town where the people are
strongly influenced by animism and fetish worship. Through their
traditional chief the people asked us if our God could protect them
from sorcerers, evil forces, and the curse of Allah if they decided to
become Christians. They asked us to show them the power of God. We
told them to look to the heavens, see the sun and moon and stars that
God had hung in the sky. But they wanted tangible evidence.
    That night as we presented our discussion, it began to rain hard.
This is rare in the desert of Mali, and the people became frightened and
fled to their homes. Had God already begun to show His power?
    That night I woke up feeling something cold on my thigh. I touched it
and immediately realized that it was a snake! If it was poisonous and it bit
me, I could die. I cried out to God to deliver me from this snake, then
slowly I began to move, careful to not trap the snake in my trousers.
    The snake slithered down my trouser leg and onto the floor. I found
a flashlight and aimed it at the snake. It lay on the floor unmoving, as if
it was paralyzed. I recognized it as a worofi, one of the deadliest snakes
 in Africa. One strike would have killed me. I reached for the box in
which I store my picture roll and struck the snake, killing it.
    Word spread through the town that the Adventist pastor had awak-
ened to fmd a worofi in his trousers and survived. Villagers came to the
house to see for themselves the snake that could not kill me. "Pastor,"
they said, "the worofi did not kill you. What a powerful God you have
 that can protect you from the worofi. Surely He can protect us against
 evil powers if we become Christians."
    By that evening the story had spread to every home in the region. The
 meeting place was packed with people. I told them the story of how Paul
 was saved from the bite of a serpent while on the island of Malta.
    As a result of my encounter with the deadly worofi, seven people
 gave their lives to God and were baptized. Many others are preparing
 for baptism. Even the traditional chief, a strong Muslim, accepted a
 Bible and is studying the Voice of Hope Bible course.
    Pray for the people of Mali. It is not easy to become a Christian here.

    Denis Patin& is a pastor-evangelist interning in Mali.

   Two thousand years after He walked the earth, millions still desire
to know the Savior—to understand His mission, to receive His gift
of grace, forgiveness, and salvation. The Four Faces ofJesus, by
Robert K. McIver, profiles each of the Gospel writers and shows
how their testimony enables us to understand Jesus better when
viewed from four different perspectives. As you read, you'll gain a
new understanding of the parables, the Sermon on the Mount, the
Olivet Discourse, and many specific episodes such as the woman
who washed Jesus' feet and the death of Lazarus.
   Anyone wishing to pursue a deeper understanding of the world of
Jesus, and of the workings of inspiration, will prize the insights
found in this book.

   How many people have turned away from God because they
looked for Him in a person or a religious group and were disap-
pointed by what they saw? See With New Eyes, by Ty Gibson, is
about God. It's not about people or religions that claim to represent
God, but about God Himself, as He has represented Himself in the
One true portrait of His character.
   Through striking language and evocative illustrations, Ty shows
that God is exactly the kind of person we had hoped He would be.
But you must close your eyes and open your heart to see Him. This
book will help you close your eyes to the ugly pictures of deity so
prevalent in our world, and open your mind and emotions to the
crystal clear image of God in the person of Jesus Christ.

anticipation wait on
             the Lord
   While society spins at a maddening pace, addicted to speed, where
are those who are "waiting," as on tiptoes, for God? In this new book,
Pastor Hyveth Williams uses an engrossing combination of humor, schol-
arship, and personal experience to illustrate the power of living in antici-
pation of the Lord's return. New life lessons pour from the Scriptures as
Williams asks:
   • Did Jesus really call that woman a dog and commend her for
      her faith?
   • Did a certain rabbi actually pray,"I thank you God that you did
      not make me a woman or a pig?"
   • What can we learn from the woman with the issue of blood?
   If you've grown weary of waiting on God to come through in your
daily trials, Anticipation will help you find your "second wind."
