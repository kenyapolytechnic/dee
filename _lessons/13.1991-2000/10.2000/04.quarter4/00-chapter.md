   Virginia Davidson and her husband, Jim,
live in Kennewick, Washington, where he
is an environmental statistician at nearby
Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. Their
two daughters, Carol and Becky, are stu-
dents at Walla Walla College and Upper
Columbia Academy, respectively.
   Through the years, Virginia's main em-
phasis has been keeper of the home. Wanting
to "be there" for her girls, she also provided
child care for friends, later moving to custom
sewing and alterations. After a six-month stint
of graphic arts at a local print shop, she re-
turned home to design and build stained-glass windows—a pursuit that
continues to furnish her days with beauty and inspiration, challenge and
opportunity. Beneath her signature, she inscribes each piece: SOLI DEO
GLORIA.


    Ernest H. J. Steed, Ph.D., rejoices in 40
years as an ordained Seventh-day Adventist
minister and 55 years as a church worker.
    With his wife, Roda, and family—Lin-
coln, Leonie, and Martin—he came to the
General Conference in 1966 and over the
next 22 years served as World Temperance
director, executive director of the International
Commission for the Prevention of Alcohol-
ism and Drug Dependency, and special as-
sistant to the General Conference president.
    Pastor Steed, in retirement at DeBary,
Florida, launched a new company, which
became a church in February 1998.

   How many people have turned away from God because they
looked for Him in a person or a religious group and were disap-
pointed by what they saw? See With New Eyes, by Ty Gibson, is
about God. It's not about people or religions that claim to represent
God, but about God Himself, as He has represented Himself in the
One true portrait of His character.
   Through striking language and evocative illustrations, Ty shows
that God is exactly the kind of person we had hoped He would be.
But you must close your eyes and open your heart to see Him. This
book will help you close your eyes to the ugly pictures of deity so
prevalent in our world, and open your mind and emotions to the
crystal clear image of God in the person of Jesus Christ.

                     Proverbs
                Wisdom to Live By
    The book of Proverbs was written primarily by Solomon, son of
David, in the early part of his reign as king of Israel. "In the
proverbs of Solomon are outlined principles of holy living and high
endeavor, principles that are heaven born and that lead to godliness,
principles that should govern every act of life. It was the wide
dissemination of these principles, and the recognition of God as the
One to whom all praise and honor belong, that made Solomon's
early reign a time of moral uplift as well as of material prosperity."
—Prophets and Kings, pp. 33, 34.
    The last two chapters of the book are attributed to "Agur" and
"Lemuel." Some scholars have assumed that these two names refer
to Solomon. Others have concluded that they were unknown compil-
ers or authors.
    We know from 1 Kings 4:32 that Solomon "uttered three thou-
sand proverbs; and his songs were a thousand and five" (RSV). His
fame spread abroad; the wisdom with which he was endowed was
the wonder of the whole world. "And the whole earth sought the
presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his
mind" (1 Kings 10:24, RSV).
    The purpose of these lessons on Proverbs is to demonstrate that
only as we have a living fellowship with God can we maintain purity
of heart and conduct. Knowing God through Christ as Savior and
King affects every area of our lives. True religion is the power for
moral and ethical purity. Proverbs is a book of practical religion
designed to demonstrate the results of faith in action. It is a tool for
the purpose of enabling believers to act wisely, to think about what
they do and why they do it, and to be more sensible and sensitive
citizens as a result of integrating learning and faith.
    We will study the book of Proverbs topically rather than verse by
verse because the issues and themes raised in the book are not in any
apparent order, and some of them recur a number of times.
     The major purpose of education is the redemption of the indi-
vidual—to impart God's character to those who are willing, so that
their thoughts, words, and deeds are truly representative of Him.
The proverbs and these lessons were designed: (1) to provide a view
of our need; (2) to lead us to the Source of wisdom, power, and
salvation; and (3) to furnish a practical guide for every motor area of
 life. Hence the title—Proverbs, Wisdom to Live By.




                                                                      5

              First Things First




Sabbath Afternoon
LEARNING IS INTENDED TO MAKE US WISE. What, though, is
wisdom? Education is a vital component to success in today's world.
But when we think it is the only means to success, we usually lose
sight of the purpose and importance of true education. Then education
becomes a frantic struggle for academic success, with financial secu-
rity as the ultimate aim.
    "Our ideas of education take too narrow and too low a range. There is
need of a broader scope, a higher aim. True education means more than the
pursual of a certain course of study. It means more than a preparation for
the life that now is. It has to do with the whole being, and with the whole
period of existence possible to man." Education, p. 13.
    William Cowper stated, "Knowledge and wisdom, far from being
one, have ofttimes no connection." Unless our learning acquaints us
with the Source of all wisdom and righteousness, unless through His
power we are being restored to His image, unless we fix our sights on
the far reaches of eternity and value everything in this life accordingly,
all acquired knowledge, learning, and skill will fall short of true educa-
tion, for they do not make us truly wise.
    This week's lesson will answer the following questions: What are
wisdom and righteousness? and Why does the Lord invite us to seek
them?

WHAT IS WISDOM? (Prov. 1:1-7; 2:10, 11).

   The value of receiving God's wisdom forms the theme of the book
of Proverbs. Solomon emphasizes that wisdom is to direct every area
of our lives. Wisdom unites holiness and the common duties of life.
Wisdom is to think and act as God would think and act in any situation.

  What is a proverb? What does Solomon state as the purpose of his
proverbs? Prov. 1:1-6.



   DEFINITION. The Hebrew word translated "proverb" means
   "to compare." A proverb comprises a brief statement of practi-
   cal wisdom in which one truth is briefly expressed through
   comparison or contrast (see Prov. 10:20). Most of the proverbs
   contain two or three lines corresponding in structure and length
   and arranged for purposes of comparison and contrast.


   What is wisdom? (Prov. 1:7)

   How is it related to knowledge? (Prov. 2:9, 10)



   To whom is wisdom available? (Prov. 1:20-23; 8:1-5)



   There is no true wisdom apart from "the fear of the Lord" (Prov. 1:7;
9:10). Where the context indicates, this fear does not refer to being afraid
but to reverence and deep respect. (See Exod. 20:20.) The ability to act
wisely stems from a heart united with God and an ear listening for His
guidance—"This is the way, walk ye in it" (Isa. 30:21).
   In some eras of history, people regarded philosophical knowledge
as having supreme value. In our age, many people view scientific
knowledge as of greater value than either philosophical or religious
knowledge. The kind of knowledge God invites us to receive, how-
ever, is an experience in holiness. To know by experience Christ's
saving grace opens for us the gates of God's eternal city.

    What is of greater value to you, an education that the world respects
 or a personal union with Christ? Explain. How would you advise a young
 person if she or he were confronted with a choice between achieving
 recognition in the world and obeying the commandments of God?

                                                                          7

THE VALUE OF WISDOM (Prov. 4:5-7).

 How do the following scriptures describe the value of wisdom?
Why are these descriptions so appropriate?

    Prov. 4:5-7

    Gal. 5:17-26

   Nothing can compare in value with the life that is "hid with Christ in
God" (Col. 3:3). When we put away the old life of sin and let Christ
control our mind, body, emotions, motives, and plans, our ethical and
moral practices will be wise. (See Col. 3:5-10.)
   In contrast to the fruit of the Spirit, Galatians 5:19-21 lists the fruit of
the flesh. How is today's society exhibiting this fruit? How can having
the fruit of the Spirit in our lives improve our lifestyle? (Examples:
Joy, peace, and patience can reduce stress. Temperance gives us a
foundation of self-control through Christ upon which all grace and
victory depends. For further study, see Temperance, p. 201.)

  List some of the advantages enjoyed by those who obtain true wis-
dom. Prov. 2:10-22; 4:6-13; 8:14-16, 18; 9:10, 11.

    Prov. 2:10-22

    Prov. 4:6-13

    Prov. 8:14-16,18

    Prov. 9:10,11

   "Discretion will protect you" (NIV). "Love for truth leads to a
consideration of right and wrong and a purposing in the heart to avoid
that which is evil. Daniel had thus counted the cost and determined not
to partake of meats offered to idols, . .. whatever might be the outcome.
Such preconsideration arms against temptation and protects from fail-
ure under sudden pressure (Dan. 1:8)."—The SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 3, p. 953.

   What other people in the Bible can you think of who, because
of their love for truth, purposed in their hearts to avoid evil?
What do their lives teach us about wisdom?
   Are you seeking the kind of wisdom that comes from God or
that which the world respects? How would you define the differ-
ence between these two kinds of wisdom?

HOW DO WE GET WISDOM? (Prov. 2:1-6; James 1:5).

   How should we seek for wisdom? Prov. 2:1-6; Jer. 29:13; James 1:5.


    Jesus' parable of the treasure hidden in a field provides a classic
illustration of the value of the heavenly treasure and the effort we need
to make to obtain it. (See Matt. 13:34.) Spiritual wisdom is part of this
treasure, and while it is a gift of God, He gives it only to those who
earnestly seek it.
    "Jesus is going from door to door, standing in front of every soul
temple, proclaiming, 'I stand at the door, and knock.' As a heavenly
merchantman, He opens His treasures and cries, 'Buy of me gold tried in
the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest
be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear.' The
gold that He offers is without alloy, more precious than that of Ophir;
for it is faith and love. The white raiment He invites the soul to wear is
His own robe of righteousness; and the oil for anointing is the oil of His
grace, which will give spiritual eyesight to the soul in blindness and
darkness, that he may distinguish between the workings of the Spirit of
God and the spirit of the enemy. 'Open your doors,' says the great
Merchantman, the possessor of spiritual riches, 'and transact your
business with Me. It is I, your Redeemer, who counsels you to buy of
Me.' "—Ellen G. White Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary, vol.
7, pp. 965, 966.
    To buy requires more than mere desire or words of appreciation. It
suggests a covenant contract. Notice that the above Spirit of Prophecy
quotation illustrates this relationship.
    God gave Solomon wisdom that "excelled the wisdom of all the
children of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt" (1 Kings
4:30). "The wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then
peace loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit,
impartial and sincere" (James 3:17, NIV).

  Time is money and life. Every day each of us spends time in trade for
one kind of treasure or another. With whom are you doing your
business? Of what character are your transactions?


  Have your priorities become confused as to what constitutes true
wealth? What do you put first each day?


   What influences do you allow to govern your decisions? What
 goals direct your conduct?

                                                                         9
Wednesday                                                   October 4
WHAT IS RIGHTEOUSNESS? (Prov. 2:7-10; 21:3).

  What characteristics do the righteous have? Prov. 29:6, 7; 11:30;
12:3. How do we obtain righteousness? Prov. 2:7-10.


   The Bible never separates the believer's righteousness from Christ's
dwelling in the heart. The covenant relationship with God, by which His
Spirit reigns within, is the only source of righteousness. (See Rom. 8:9,
10; 10:6-10.) The power to think righteous thoughts and do righteous
deeds is available only to the person who has friendship and fellowship
with Christ.
   "So we have nothing in ourselves of which to boast. We have no
ground for self-exaltation. Our only ground of hope is in the righteous-
ness of Christ imputed to us, and in that wrought by His Spirit working
in and through us."—Steps to Christ, p. 63.

  What two types of activity does Proverbs 21:3 contrast, and how
does God relate to each? Compare Isaiah 1:10-18.


   Can't you almost hear the Lord's frustration mingled with heartbreak
for His wayward people? "Come!" He pleads. "Let Me give you a so-
lution to your situation. I can change your sinful heart. Sacrifices were
intended to remind you of the Messiah to come, but only I can take
away your sin. Even though your sins are like crimson, I can make them
as white as snow." (See Isa. 1:10-18; Amos 5:21-24.)
   Unless the carnal mind is crucified, there is no salvation. (See Rom.
8:6.) Any kind of sacrifice with an unsurrendered heart is only a form of
godliness without the power. God rejects all rituals and human per-
formances in the absence of His righteousness. This alone renders the
heart right and just.
   Jesus became human that He might reveal beyond all question what
God is like and what He really wants of His people. The Lord declared,
"Lo, I come ... to do thy will, 0 God" (Heb. 10:7; see also Ps. 40:8). It was
not merely to prove it could be done that Jesus lived a life of harmony
and obedience. His life revealed what was in His heart. He offers this
same experience to all who will receive it. (See Ezek. 36:26; Heb. 8:10.)

  As you examine your heart critically, on whose righteousness do
you tend to depend: Christ's or your own?


    Do you feel God accepts you because of the good things you
 do or because of what Christ has done and is doing for you?

RIGHTEOUSNESS AND WISDOM (Prov. 2:1-6, 9).

   Explain the relationship between righteousness and wisdom. Prov.
2:1-6, 9; 23:23, 24.


    In the Old Testament, those having wisdom are not necessarily the
"wise" of the book of Proverbs. They may be: (1) those who practice
magic arts (Exod. 7:11; Isa. 47:9, 10); (2) those with special skills (Exod.
36:8; 2 Chron. 2:12); (3) those who are clever, sly, or cunning (2 Sam.
14:2); (4) those who have the practical wisdom to handle the perils of life
(Prov. 6:6; 14:24); (5) cultured, educated people (1 Kings 4:29); and (6)
those who accept commandments and instruction (Prov. 3:1; 8:33).
    In contrast, the kind of wisdom that the book of Proverbs discusses
is the righteousness that results from a covenant relationship with God.
When the Lord has control of a mind through the power of His Spirit,
that mind is a wise, righteous mind.
    A righteous person is wise in a multitude of ways, many of which the
book of Proverbs spells out. The author is not saying that we become
righteous in God's eyes when we act in a wise manner. Rather, the
message is that when we come to know the Lord—as it is our privilege
to know Him—our thoughts, words, and deeds are wise because
Christ has become our righteousness and wisdom. (See 1 Cor. 1:30.)
    From a human perspective, wisdom is to engage in both good and
evil. Human wisdom seeks to become wise in all things and does not
settle on anything as absolute truth.
    God's wisdom, on the other hand, is to know the difference between
good and evil and to choose only the good. The power to choose the
good and practice it is made possible through the life, death, and
resurrection of our Lord.
    Humankind lost ready access to God's wisdom at the tree of knowl-
 edge of good and evil. Everyone seeks wisdom, but how many really
 comprehend what wisdom truly is? In the book of Proverbs, God reveals
 His wisdom as the answer to human inquiry.
     It is notable that all so-called sacred writings outside the Bible
 basically teach the necessity of a balance between good and evil as the
 foundation of wisdom. In contrast, Proverbs explains wisdom as being
 centered in God, with each proverb depicting a contrast between God's
 way and the world's way. The message of Proverbs is indeed the good
 news that a divine power is available to help us live in harmony with
 God. "He guards the course of the just and protects the way of his
 faithful ones" (Prov. 2:8, NIV).

  How can you recognize God as the Source of all true wisdom?
 What are you doing about it?

                                                                         11

FURTHER STUDY: Study the following New Testament passages
on the subject of wisdom: 1 Cor. 1:25-30; 2:6-16; 3:19.
   Read "The Source and Aim of True Education," pp. 13-19, in
Education.

    "A knowledge of God is the foundation of all true education and of
all true service. . . . This knowledge is the essential preparation both for
this life and for the life to come."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 409.
    "The fear of the Lord lies at the very foundation of all progress; it is
the beginning of wisdom. Your Heavenly Father has claims upon you;
for without solicitation or merit on your part He gives you the bounties
of His providence. . .. As you are bought with a price, even the precious
blood of the Son of God, He requires that you make a right use of the
privileges you enjoy. Your intellectual and moral faculties are God's
gifts, talents entrusted to you for wise improvement, and you are not at
liberty to let them lie dormant for want of proper cultivation, or be
crippled and dwarfed by inaction. It is for you to determine whether or
not the weighty responsibilities that rest upon you shall be faithfully
met, whether or not your efforts shall be well directed and your best."
—Fundamentals of Christian Education, pp. 85, 86.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Why is wisdom so important, and why do we need to search
     it? Why isn't it easier to acquire? Or is it? Explain.

     2. Why aren't people more interested in looking for and find-
        ing wisdom? Why do people find it so hard to revere and
        respect God?

     3. How can you prove to a nonbelieving friend that God's wisdom
        gives greater rewards than the world's wisdom?

     4. You will notice as you study that Proverbs refers to wisdom in
        the feminine. Why do you think this is so? See Revelation 12;
        21:9. As you read Proverbs, could you substitute the word
        church for the word wisdom? How would doing so increase
        your understanding of the church?

SUMMARIZE this week's lesson by answering the questions asked at
the beginning of the week: What are wisdom and righteousness? Why
does the Lord invite us to seek them?
   The fear of the Lord—a relationship of reverence, admiration, and
trust—puts the seeker of wisdom in touch with its Source. It enables
us to view life fom the perspective of eternity and to make decisions
accordingly, placing us in the line for ultimate success.

                      The Robbers Repent
                             J. H. Zachary
   Every week Pastor Karro Rao gathered the tithes and offerings
from the churches of his district in the South Western Mission of
Papua New Guinea to take to the mission office. The week's offerings
usually amounted to close to 3,000 kinars (U.S. $1,500).
   As he made his way along the narrow road, a bamboo pole sud-
denly fell across his pathway and four robbers surrounded him. One
wielded a knife; another a homemade gun. "Are you carrying money?"
they asked.
   "Yes," the pastor answered truthfully.
   "Then hand it over," one man ordered.
   "I can do that," the pastor answered. "But you must know that this
money does not belong to me. I am a pastor. This money was given by
my church members for the work of God. I have 5 kinars of my own
money that I will give to you, but I urge you to not touch God's
money."
   "Give us all of the money!" the robbers ordered threateningly.
   Pastor Rao gave the bandits all the money he was carrying. After
the bandits disappeared, Pastor Rao hurried to a telephone and called
the mission office to report the theft. Then he asked the office staff to
pray that God would help get the money back.
   Six days later Pastor Rao was walking along the same pathway
when a bamboo pole again dropped across the path in front of him.
This time the pole had a plastic bag attached to it. It was his money
bag. Before he could retrieve the bag, the same four criminals sur-
rounded him. "Please take this money and give it for God's work," one
man said.
   Curious, the pastor asked, "What happened to make you change
your mind?"
   "We wanted to buy some beer and get drunk. But when we tried to
open the bag of money, our hands began to shake so violently that we
could not open it."
    Pastor Rao answered, "Thank God! He loves you so much, and He
has a better life planned for you. I am sure that you do not want to
spend the rest of your life hurting people."
    Pastor Rao developed a friendship with these men, and within a few
 months one of them was baptized. The others are still preparing to
 experience that better life that Pastor Rao has promised them.

           A Star to Guide the
                Humble



Sabbath Afternoon
WHAT IS TRUST, AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? Faith, the hand
that lays hold upon God's resources, consists of more than just belief;
trust is a vital part. What, though, is trust? How does it work?
   Does trust belong in a compartment separate from daily life, pre-
served only for religion? Is it practical? Can it benefit anybody?
   These questions deserve answers. Indeed, we need these answers
in order to survive.
   Trust includes the willingness to commit oneself to the care of the
one trusted. It is one thing to agree that a tightrope walker is capable of
wheeling a person in a wheelbarrow on a rope strung over a thundering
waterfall. It is quite another to volunteer to ride in the wheelbarrow.
   A dictionary defines trust as complete assurance regarding the
character, ability, strength, or truth of someone or something. Trust
involves placing confidence in someone, depending on that person,
committing oneself to her or his care, and relying totally on her or his
integrity.
   Jesus is the only One we can fully trust. He is like a gleaming star on
a clear night to whom each believing traveler may look for guidance and
comfort. This week's lesson will answer the questions What is trust?
What is it for? and Whom is it for?

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE:
  I. What Trust Is Versus What Trust Is Not (Prov. 22:17-19).
 11. Is Our Trust Misplaced?—Part 1 (Prov. 28:26).
I11. Is Our Trust Misplaced?—Part 2 (Prov. 11:4).
IV. A Star to Guide the Humble, Part 1 (Prov. 3:5, 6).

MEMORY TEXT: "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean
not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge
him, and he will make your paths straight" (Proverbs 3:5, 6, NIV).

WHAT TRUST IS VERSUS WHAT TRUST IS NOT (Prov.
22:17-19).

   How do we acquire trust? Prov. 22:17-10.


   Trust is God's gift to us that develops as we admit our weakness
and submit to His enabling might. God does not make us trust Him
when we wish to doubt. Real trust is based on an intimate knowledge
of the one trusted. Because we learn of and accept God's love and
ability to sustain us, we trust Him. Willingness to trust God enables us
to trust human beings whom we have discovered to be trustworthy.
   "While God has given ample evidence for faith, He will never
remove all excuse for unbelief. All who look for hooks to hang their
doubts upon will find them. And those who refuse to accept and obey
God's word until every objection has been removed, and there is no
longer an opportunity for doubt, will never come to the light.
   "Distrust of God is the natural outgrowth of the unrenewed heart,
which is at enmity with Him. But faith is inspired by the Holy Spirit, and
it will flourish only as it is cherished. No man can become strong in
faith without a determined effort. Unbelief strengthens as it is encour-
aged; and if men, instead of dwelling upon the evidences which God
has given to sustain their faith, permit themselves to question and cavil
[complain], they will find their doubts constantly becoming more
confirmed."—The Great Contoversy, p. 527; emphasis supplied.

   What can you learn from the following scriptures concerning how
trust grows and becomes strong?


   Scripture                         What Did You Learn?

   Prov. 29:25

   Prov. 30:5

   Matt. 8:5-10

   Matt. 9:2

   James 1:2-8


    Suppose friends of yours are suffering the tragedy of losing a
 child in a car accident or to a fatal illness. What could you say or
 do to help them trust in God?

                                                                       15

IS OUR TRUST MISPLACED?—PART 1 (Prov. 28:26).

   Faith is no problem for some people—they have faith in just about
anything! Trust, however, is worthless if not anchored in that which is
trustworthy.

     What warning does Solomon sound in Proverbs 28:26?


   Self-confidence in questions involving eternal salvation and the
ability to overcome sin are a sure passport to ruin. (See John 15:5; Jer.
10:23; 2 Cor. 3:5.)
   "The Jewish leaders were impenitent and self-sufficient. The reli-
gious life of the Jewish nation had become a pretense. . . . When Christ
came in person to set before them the principles of the law [Matt. 22:34-
37], they rejected Him."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 276.

  Who else is unsafe to trust besides ourselves, and why does
Scripture warn us against trusting such people?


     Prov. 2:11-15

     Ps. 41:9

     Jer. 17:5

   Scripture sends us this invitation: "Now that you have purified your
souls by your obedience to the truth so that you have genuine mutual
love, love one another deeply from the heart" (1 Pet. 1:22, NRSV).
Obviously, such love involves a measure of trust. We trust those who
trust the Lord—at least in regard to some things. We also trust unbe-
lieving friends in regard to some things. It would be a fatal mistake,
however, to trust fellow Christians to keep us from falling into sin.
They might help, but the ultimate deliverance comes only from Christ.
   Many people "have not been in the habit of prayerfully considering
for themselves, with unprejudiced, unbiased judgment, questions and
subjects that are new and that are ever liable to arise. They wait to see
what others will think. . . . Unless these become sensible of their
wavering character and correct it, they will all fail of everlasting life;
they will be unable to cope with the perils of the last days."—Testimo-
nies for the Church, vol. 2, pp. 129, 130.

   If we are sincere about our Christianity, how will God pre-
 vent us from becoming self-confident in matters of salvation?

IS OUR TRUST MISPLACED?—PART 2 (Prov. 11:4).

   In our materialistic age, the tendency is to rely upon things for
security. The inspired counsel is that the Lord is our only security. He
expects us to do what we can to provide for ourselves and our families,
but ultimately our dependence must be totally upon Him. When it is no
longer possible for believers to buy or sell (Rev. 13:17), they will know
from past experience the value of trust in God to carry them through the
time of tribulation and persecution.

   List some things that are unworthy of our trust, stating briefly why
they are untrustworthy.

   Prov. 3:31, 32

   Prov. 10:18

   Prov. 11:4

   Prov. 31:30


  What special blessings are given to those who trust in the Lord?
Prov. 8:17, 18.


   God invites us to trust in Him to receive His righteousness. Good-
ness, love, mercy, and wise counsel flow from the life of the one who
constantly relies upon the Lord. Self-dependence, self-assurance in
spiritual life, is a snare that Satan has prepared to destroy God's
people. Satan's studied purpose is to lead us to trust our own efforts
and to respect our own goodness. If he were to succeed in this, we
would become his victims, and the life of victory would escape us.

   Proverbs 8:17, 18, says that when we trust God, He gives us "du-
rable riches." What are some of these riches, and how can we use them
as a means of serving God?

   Ps. 9:9

   Ps. 73:24

   Isa. 45:22

   Matt. 28:20

                                                                      17

A STAR TO GUIDE THE HUMBLE, PART 1 (Prov. 3:5, 6).

     Explain why God wants us to trust Him. Prov. 3:5, 6; Matt. 6:25-34.


   "If you have given yourself to God, to do His work, you have no
need to be anxious for tomorrow. . . . When we take into our hands the
management of things with which we have to do, and depend upon our
own wisdom for success, we are taking a burden which God has not
given us, and are trying to bear it without His aid. We are taking upon
ourselves the responsibility that belongs to God, and thus are really
putting ourselves in His place. We may well have anxiety and anticipate
danger and loss, for it is certain to befall us. But when we really
believe that God loves us and means to do us good we shall cease to
worry about the future. We shall trust God as a child trusts a loving
parent. Then our troubles and torments will disappear, for our will is
swallowed up in the will of God."—Thoughts From the Mount of
Blessing, pp. 100, 101.

     What principle did Paul express in 2 Corinthians 12:10?


   Paul did not enjoy pain and suffering but was glad he could share in
the sufferings of Christ. In times of trial and pain, he recognized more
fully the need for total dependence upon the Lord. After he had prayed
three times for his "thorn in the flesh" to be removed (2 Cor. 12:7, 8), God
assured him that His grace was sufficient, that His "strength is made
perfect in weakness" (2 Cor. 12:9). Paul's response amounted to the
declaration: "Then I am willing to acknowledge my weakness so that I
can have the grace (the power) of Christ. Now I see in trials and
persecution the means by which I am led to rely more fully upon the
Source of my power."

   List some prerequisites for answered prayer. Matt. 7:7; 1 John
3:22; 5:14, 15. Under what circumstances will God not answer our
prayers? James 4:3; Ps. 66:18.


   Before we ask, we must realize our need. This is one of the first
conditions of effective prayer. Cherished sin makes it impossible for
God to answer our prayers. When we put away sin and trust the Lord to
answer us, we can be assured that He will give us whatever is for our
best good.

     How can we weaken our faith in God by the way we pray?

A STAR TO GUIDE THE HUMBLE, PART 2 (Phil. 4:19; Prov.
16:9).

   Yesterday, we studied about why God wants us to trust Him and the
part prayer has in establishing that trust. Today's lesson continues
that study.
   As shortsighted human beings, we tend to pray for things that
would do us more harm than good. The beautiful truth is that God may
deny us what we have asked for, but in its place He will give us that
which is best for us. Our faith should not fail when God does not answer
our prayer right away. From His divine perspective, He is able to see
perfectly the results of any course of action. He knows best where we
should work, with whom we should associate closely, where we should
live, and what influences are most likely to prepare us effectively to
spend eternity with Him. Trust Him!
   After accepting Christ and the advent message, a young man went
to college to prepare for the ministry. Halfway through the year he
realized that he did not have enough money to continue. Earnestly he
shared with a religion teacher his deep conviction that he should be a
minister, but how could he ever fulfill the Lord's will if he could not
afford an education? The teacher encouraged the student to remain in
college for two more weeks, and they both agreed to take the young
man's financial need to the Lord every day. At the end of the two
weeks, the student received a letter containing a check for the amount
he needed to continue in college. "And my God will meet all your needs
according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus" (Phil. 4:19, NIV).

  What special blessing can we claim when we trust the Lord to guide
us? Prov. 16:9; Ps. 32:8.


   The various translations of Proverbs 16:9 help us grasp the full
meaning of this blessing: "You may make your plans, but God directs
your actions" (TEV). "A man's mind plans his way, but the Lord directs
his steps and makes them sure" (Amplified).
   Of course, there is a definite condition to such guidance. We can
expect it when we are committed to Christ and, by His grace, doing His
will. Proverbs 16:8 reads: "Better a little with righteousness than much
gain with injustice" (Prov. 16:8, NIV).

    Think of an example from your own experience of God's
 leading you in a direction that you never would have chosen for
 yourself. Why did His way prove to be better than the way you
 could have planned for yourself? Plan to share your experience
 with your Sabbath School class.

                                                                      19
Friday                                                  October 13
FURTHER STUDY: Consider the following counsel regarding the
importance of trusting the Lord: Psalm 37:3-6; 118:5-8; Isaiah 26:3, 4.
Also consider the following regarding the dangers of distrusting Him:
Isaiah 30:1, 2; Jeremiah 5:17; 17:5.
   Read Steps to Christ, pp. 121-124.

   "If we would give more expression to our faith, rejoice more in the
blessings that we know we have—the great mercy and love of God—
we should have more faith and greater joy. No tongue can express, no
finite mind can conceive, the blessing that results from appreciating
the goodness and love of God."—Sons and Daughters of God, p. 122.
   "Jesus does not release us from the necessity of effort, but He
teaches that we are to make Him first and last and best in everything.
We are to engage in no business, follow no pursuit, seek no pleasure,
that would hinder the outworking of His righteousness in our character
and life."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 99.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. List and discuss some of the things that keep us from trusting
     God. How can we resist those influences that threaten to destroy
     our trust in Him?

     2. What New Testament stories support Proverbs 11:4, 28; 23:4,
        5? Why is it so difficult for rich people to enter God's king-
        dom?

     3. How can we develop faith that the Lord will direct us in the
        practical affairs of daily life?

     4. To what extent can we cooperate with God in the growth of our
        faith?

SUMMARIZE this week's lesson by answering the following ques-
tions: What is trust? What is it for? and Whom is it for?
   It is impossible for a proud heart to trust in God, but only He has the
solutions for our personal and corporate problems. His blessings are
available in abundance as we ask and submit ourselves to His perfect
and gracious will.

                          A Faithful Son
                         Charlotte Ishkanian

    Cicero was the fifth of fourteen children living in a remote region
of northeastern Brazil. He was a quiet boy who worked hard. His
father worked for an Adventist farmer, and when Cicero was 12
years old, the farmer invited him to work on the farm, too.
    Cicero proved to be an honest and faithful worker, and the farmer's
family invited him to live with them. When the family went to the city,
they trusted Cicero to take care of the farm. They often talked to Cicero
about God and invited him to attend church with them. Thus Cicero
met God. He had never attended school, but he taught himself to read
so he could read the Bible with his new family. Often the farmer saw
Cicero standing among the trees, preaching to an invisible audience.
    Cicero was baptized when he was 16. He enjoyed taking part in
church activities and dreamed that one day he would preach in church.
The lay elders often preached when the pastor was absent. Finally,
Cicero found the courage to offer to preach. He carefully wrote his
own sermon. After that he often preached.
    As they worked together on the farm, Cicero talked to his younger
brothers, Jose, 15, and Ricardo, 13, about God and invited them to
attend church with him.
    One day Jose and Ricardo were weeding when they heard a noise
and looked up to see Cicero stumbling toward them. The boys ran to
their brother. They saw that he was sick and remembered he had been
spraying insecticide that morning. They realized he must be suffering
from insecticide poisoning. Ricardo wanted to run for help, but Cicero
stopped him. "I am going to sleep now," Cicero said. "You boys follow
Jesus and tell everyone to be ready, for His coming is soon. I want to
see you in heaven." Cicero was losing consciousness as Ricardo raced
for help.
    Cicero was unconscious when a neighbor arrived. He loaded the
young man into the car for the 20-minute drive to the nearest hospital.
When they arrived doctors tried to revive the boy, but he did not
 respond. Within an hour Cicero was dead.
    Ricardo and Jose told their mother what Cicero had said before he
 died. She had attended church when Cicero preached, but her husband
 would not permit her to be baptized. After Cicero's death she did not
 ask permission. She and her children began attending church regularly.
 She and her daughter and Jose were baptized. Cicero's testimony led
 them to Christ. Now they want to carry his spirit of service to others.

     What I Am Versus What
        You Think I Am




Sabbath Afternoon
WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHARACTER AND
REPUTATION? We have all heard that a good name is a precious
thing. What is a "good name"? Is a good name the same as a good
character? If someone slanders our good name, does that person
destroy our good character? What can we learn from the relationship
between character and reputation in human experience that will en-
able us to understand God's concern in the great controversy? How
will that understanding help us relate to the crises in our lives?
    We will look for answers to these questions in the Word of God,
and especially, in the book of Proverbs. As you study, remember that
it is more important to do what is right than to have a good reputation.

PRIDE GOES BEFORE A FALL, PART 1 (Prov. 16:18).

   Many people talk and write about self-esteem. As evidence that we
should love ourselves, Christian authors often quote Jesus' words " 'Love
your neighbors as yourself' " (Matt. 19:19, NIV). It is true that when
people no longer doubt their self-worth, they are more likely to love others.
However, some authors suggest that personal pride is essential to success,
while others regard self-respect as a humble recognition of self-worth,
despite realistic awareness of one's weaknesses.

   Review what self-esteem did for Lucifer. Ezek. 28:11-19.


   When one's self-esteem blurs supreme love and respect for God, the
result is self-idolatry. Awareness of our dependence upon the Creator
for life, health, talent, wealth, and success preserves a realistic view of
our own worth in relation to other created beings. Lucifer's self-esteem
became unholy self-love.

   What results of pride do the following verses emphasize?

          Verse                                 Result

   Prov. 11:2

   Prov. 13:10, 18

   Prov. 15:25

   Prov. 17:19

   The results of pride illustrated:
   *Nebuchadnezzar responded positively to Daniel's message (Dan.
2:47). Sometime later, however, he forgot the one true God and gave
himself all the credit for his prosperity. Read Daniel 4:28-33. (As a
result, he suffered from insanity for seven years.)
   *Herod Agrippa I, grandson of Herod the Great, was hailed by Tyre
and Sidon as a god (Acts 12:22). Read the results in Acts 12:23.
   *The disciples of Jesus spent much time arguing over which of them
was the greatest (Luke 22:24). This desire for self-exaltation kept them
spiritually weak and disqualified them for the test of their faith during
Jesus' trial and crucifixion.

    Give an example from your own experience that illustrates
 the truth in Proverbs 16:18.

TRUE GOODNESS (Prov. 25:6, 7).

   Explain why pride is so objectionable to God. Matt. 11:29; Prov.
6:16, 17.


   "God does not regard all sins as of equal magnitude; there are
degrees of guilt in His estimation, . . . but however trifling this or that
wrong act may seem in the eyes of men, no sin is small in the eyes of
God. . .. The drunkard is despised, and is told that his sin will exclude
him from heaven; while pride, selfishness, and covetousness too often
go unrebuked. But these are sins that are especially offensive to God;
for they are contrary to the benevolence of His character. . . . He who
falls into some of the grosser sins may feel a sense of his shame and
poverty and his need of the grace of Christ; but pride feels no need, and
so it closes the heart against Christ and the blessings He came to
give."—Steps to Christ, p. 30.

   In what manner does pride often express itself? Prov. 20:6;
25:6, 7; 26:12; Luke 18:9-14.


    To the majority, goodness is something that "makes you feel
good." It brings you some unexpected pleasure. Or it is being kind or
able to succeed in the legitimate pursuits of life.
   Others believe that goodness is a cultural or societal expression of
values. In some instances this is true. For example, society usually
dictates the way people dress or wear their hair. To deviate from these
accepted styles may mean that a person is not considered to be good.
   However, in Psalm 25:8, we read the true definition of goodness.
"Good and upright is the Lord. Therefore will he teach sinners in the
way." Jesus said, "There is none good but one, that is God" (Matt.
19:17). God's goodness is illustrated in Jesus' life. Therefore, we must
focus on Him.

  What is another way in which people sometimes display pride?
Prov. 31:30.


   In your attitude toward others, how do you sometimes dem-
onstrate personal pride? How would your relationships with
others improve if, by Christ's grace, you learned to be humble?
If pride is blinding, how does a person come to see her or his
need? What internal work are you neglecting that would pre-
vent pride from developing and manifesting itself?

THE VALUE OF A GOOD NAME, PART 1 (Prov. 22:1).

   Someone has said, "Given the choice between the name of a great
company and its material assets, I would choose the name." Why?
Without the name, the assets would remain at a fixed value or even
depreciate, whereas the name itself could rebuild the assets lost and
then gain even more.

   What value did Solomon place on "a good name"? Prov. 22:1.


    What is a good name? Hebrew poetry is known for parallelism and
pun, or its play on words, rather than for rhyme. In parallelism, a
statement is made twice but expressed differently the second time.
Besides adding interest, comparison of the parallel phrases achieves a
deeper understanding of the subject. For instance, in Proverbs 22:1,
"great riches" is echoed in "silver and gold," and "a good name" finds
its counterpart in "loving favor." Solomon was not referring to a busi-
ness deal. He was extolling the excellence of a good character.
    In Bible times, a name was more than a mere title or identification. It
represented reputation or character. It often told who you were, what
you were like, what you had done, and even what you might become.
(See Gen. 16:11; 17:5, 15; 32:28.) Some family names today reflect this:
Mr. Cooper made barrels, while Mr. Fuller washed clothes. Smith made
the anvil ring in the blacksmith shop and fashioned useful implements,
and, of course, Johnson was the son of John.
    "The Hebrews, like other ancient Near Eastern peoples, attached
great significance to personal names. Their names had a literal meaning
sometimes symbolic of the character and personality of the one it
designated, and sometimes reflecting the moods or feelings of the one
giving the name. . . .
    "Perhaps the most popular type of name among the Israelites was one
that contained some reference to the true God. Such a name was often
a pious declaration of faith."—SDA Bible Dictionary, article, "Name."
    So we find Joel—"Yahweh is God," Elijah—"Yahweh is my God,"
Nathanael—"God has given," and Ishmael—"God hears."
    This also is why the third commandment (Exod. 20:7) directs us to revere
God's name. His name symbolizes His infinitely holy character (Exod. 34:5-
7), so when we misuse His name, we depreciate His character. Using the
 Lord's name carelessly or as an exclamation demonstrates a lack of love and
 respect for Him, as well as a lack of trust in Him.

   Why should the church as a corporate body have a good
 name? Explain why the actions of individual members are im-
 portant in establishing a good name for the church?

                                                                         25

THE VALUE OF A GOOD NAME, PART 2 (Prov. 30:5, 6; 14:31).

    Yesterday we ended our daily study by learning about the impor-
tance of God's name and the need to respect it. Because His name
symbolizes His holy character, we show disrespect for His name when
we misuse it (Exod. 20:7). The third "commandment not only prohib-
its false oaths and common swearing, but it forbids us to use the name
of God in a light or careless manner, without regard to its awful
significance. By the thoughtless mention of God in common conversa-
tion, by appeals to Him in trivial matters, and by the frequent and
thoughtless repetition of His name, we dishonor Him."—Patriarchs
and Prophets, pp. 306, 307.

  In what other ways can we take God's name in vain? Prov. 30:5, 6;
14:31.


    When you become a Christian, you take Christ's name. "God sends
you into the world as His representative. In every act of life, you are to
make manifest the name of God. . . . You cannot hallow His name, you
cannot represent Him to the world, unless in life and character you
represent the very life and character of God. This you can do only
through the acceptance of the grace and righteousness of Christ.
    "It is because men take upon themselves the name of Christ, while in
life they deny His character, that Christianity has so little power in the
world."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pp. 107, 137.
    "The misuse of the divine name was especially heinous among
people who believed that the name was an essential part of the person-
ality. The very naming of the name invoked the power of the whole
person of whom the name was a part."—The Interpreter's Bible, vol.
1, p. 983. (See yesterday's study.)
    We do not use the names of people we love and respect to curse
with. By instructing us not to take His name in vain, God is telling us
how worthy He really is of our admiration and love.
    If we break this commandment, we are letting others know that we do
not really think highly of God. The way we spend our money tells others
what we consider to be important. Likewise, the words we use tell
others whether or not we truly believe God is worthy of our praise.

   John the revelator saw "the Lamb, standing on Mount Zion,
 and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father's name
 written on their foreheads" (Rev. 14:1, NIV; see also 22:4).
 Explain the significance that the name of God and Christ is
 written on the foreheads of the redeemed.

THE VALUE OF A GOOD NAME, PART 3 (Mal. 3:6; Rev. 3:12).

   What statement does God make regarding His character? Mal. 3:6;
see also Heb. 13:8; James 1:17.

   God's character is what He is, demonstrated by how He thinks and
acts toward those He created. His perfect character is changeless. As a
transcript of His character, His law also is perfect. To alter any feature
of His character or His law would damage it. This He will not do, nor
can anyone else do.
   God's reputation is an entirely different matter. By misrepresenting
His character, Lucifer gave God a bad reputation. Stirred by jealousy, he
charged God with being arbitrary, harsh, unfair, and untruthful. He
argued that if he were in control, things would be different.
   In order to reveal the true nature of Satan's work, God must both
allow sin to fully develop, and He must demonstrate His own character
in contrast to that of Satan. The controversy begun in heaven continues
here on earth. God gives each of us the freedom to choose whose
character our lives will demonstrate—God's or Satan's. Although per-
sonal redemption is an aspect, the plan of salvation involves so much
more. God wants to do more than just proclaim us righteous (forgive our
past sin). He also wants to make us righteous (restore us). Through the
grace and power that Jesus bought for us at Calvary, we can live out His
character. Then, even though others may give us a bad reputation, they
can never give us a bad character.

   In heaven, what will symbolize our experience as Christians? Isa.
62:2; Rev. 2:17; 3:12.


   A young groom gave his bride a new name on their wedding day—
his name. For a wedding present, he gave her a small white stone
inscribed with her new name. After more than twenty years, that white
stone is still a treasure, for the writing on it symbolizes an experience.
Everyone who knows her, knows her name. But no one else knows the
precious and multi-faceted friendship the white stone symbolizes. The
bride is still honored to carry her husband's name as her own and is
committed to honoring him in the way she lives it.
   Each overcomer, through Christ's grace, will be growing in such a
unique, personal relationship.

        true humility?

     3. How is an understanding of an experience in humility a key
        to developing an attitude of reverence?

     4. Explain the role of the Holy Spirit in character development.
        Support your explanation with texts from the Bible.

SUMMARIZE this week's lesson by answering the questions in Sabbath's
introduction.
   A good name is a priceless treasure. It increases the effectiveness of
our witness. Reputation is easily destroyed by gossip or slander, but
slander does not have to destroy character. The slander of God's
character by the evil one and those who follow him has in no way
changed His perfect purity and infinitely loving disposition. Who you
really are is more important than another person's opinion about you.

                 The Preacher in the Forest
                           Andrejs Arinsh

    The land in Latvia lies flat and fertile. Farmland and forest
surround small clusters of homes. Life in these villages has changed
little over the years. Most people farm or work in nearby textile
mills, much as their parents did. And most people die in the faith
into which they were born.
    During Communist times the few Adventists who lived in such
villages had no ordained pastor. They worshiped quietly in their
homes. The young leader of one such group had a zeal for sharing
his faith with others. He could never hope to study theology in a
seminary, but he studied his Bible and became an active soul
winner.
    Word of this young man's evangelistic efforts spread, and even-
tually the government learned of his religious activities. They tried
to quiet him through threats, but that did not work. Finally the
government sent him to live and work in the forest. His job was to
gather pitch to be used in the manufacture of plastics and chemi-
cals. This assignment, the officials felt, would keep him from
causing trouble for them, and since few people lived in the forest,
he would have few people to influence.
    But the man found that his new job did not require him to work
long hours. He had even more time to visit people and share his
faith. After work he rode his motorcycle into the surrounding
villages, where he shared the Bible with anyone who would listen.
    For years the young man worked in the forest, gathering pitch
by day and visiting people at night. He traveled to every village in
the region, sharing his love for Christ and studying the Bible with
anyone who was interested. He organized home worship groups
and encouraged the believers. Some groups had only a few mem-
bers, but others had 30 or 40 members. And because he faithfully
 gathered his quota of pitch in the forest and limited his visitation to
 the small villages, the government officials seldom bothered him.
     When Communism in Latvia fell and people were again free to
 worship publicly, these small groups of Adventists sponsored Bible
 seminars and evangelistic meetings, inviting their neighbors and
 family members. A large number of people were baptized, prima-
 rily because of the quiet work of the preacher who lived in the
 forest.

                    An Ounce of
                     Prevention




Sabbath Afternoon
CHRIST'S POWER IS THE SOURCE OF SPIRITUAL HEALTH.
Even as righteousness involves more than refraining from evil, so
health is more than the absence of disease. It includes the well-being
of all our capabilities.
   By enticing us with many acts of intemperance, Satan seeks to
destroy our mental, moral, and physical powers. He used many tempta-
tions to entrap Jesus but failed every time because Jesus relied fully on
His Father's strength. Tragically, the rest of humanity has been all too
responsive to evil. Noah sought refuge in alcohol. Abraham bowed to
dishonesty and self-dependence. David fell prey to immorality. Moses
lost his temper, and Peter contradicted his faith. The Corinthian Chris-
tians gave loyalty to men instead of Christ, and the Galatians substi-
tuted a gospel of human invention for the gospel of Jesus.
   As you study this week's lesson, remember the bright side of the
picture—Satan is a defeated foe. When we unite our weakness to God's
might, we are more than a match for the devil's clever illusions. The
choice is ours, but the power is of God.

HEALTH AND TEMPERANCE (Prov. 17:22; 1 Cor. 6:19, 20).

   Temperance is to life, health, and character as mortar is to a brick
building. Without temperance, one can neither build nor maintain
health. The word temperance is an old English word used to indicate
abstinence and moderation. The word's basic root meaning refers to
an act of separation. The Latin root is tempus, meaning time, the
thought of separating the past and the future. The word temple, also
based on the root tempus, gives the idea of a place of separation.
   Temperance then, as it relates to wisdom, is through Christ's power
and our choice to separate the good from the bad. Thus, intemperance
results from mingling good with evil. (See Gal. 5:23.) Temperance is
exercising self-control and separating ourselves from evil, through the
power of the Holy Spirit. Intemperance is the loss of self-control and
joining with evil.
   First Corinthians 6:19, 20 is a good prescription for preventive
medicine. What does prevention imply? How does prevention apply to
spiritual health?


   What close relationship between the mind and body is revealed in
the following verses? Prov. 17:22; 18:14.


   Modern science is discovering that the bonds between the mind and
the body are much closer than previously thought. What affects the
body affects the mind and vice versa. Mental power is dependent on
physical health, and physical well-being is fostered by a mind at peace.
Spiritual power is related to both mental and physical health. As we
realize that the brain is the only medium of communication between God
and a person and that the mind is affected by the body, the importance
of temperance comes into proper focus. (See Temperance, p. 13.)
   "Dr. William Fry, Jr., of the Department of Psychiatry at Stanford
Medical School, likens laughter to a form of physical exercise. It
causes huffing and puffing, speeds up the heart rate, raises blood
pressure, accelerates breathing, increases oxygen consumption, gives
the muscles of the face and stomach a workout, and relaxes muscles
not involved in laughing. Twenty seconds of laughter, he has con-
tended, can double the heart rate for three to five minutes. That is the
equivalent of three minutes of strenuous rowing."—Norman Cousins,
 Head First, The Biology of Hope (New York: E. P. Dutton, 1989),
p. 132. (For a further account, see also pp. 132-134.)

 and laughter to your day?

A BRAWLING MOCKER (Prov. 20:1).

  What warnings regarding intemperance do the following verses
emphasize? Prov. 20:1; 23:20, 21, 29-35.


    It is a well-documented fact that alcohol impairs the mental, physi-
cal, and social well-being, thus, impairing the spiritual life. It seems to
drinkers that alcohol lifts them above the cares of reality into a world
of happiness, strength, and intelligence. In truth, the opposite takes
place. Just one ounce of alcohol retards muscular reaction by 17.4
percent, increases the time required to make a decision by 9.7 percent,
causes an increase in errors due to a lack of attention by 35.3 percent,
and accelerates errors due to a lack of muscle coordination by 59.7
percent. Proverbs 31:4, 5, especially warns leaders that alcohol will
destroy their capacity to make good judgments and administer wisely.
   "Satan gathered the fallen angels together to devise some way of
doing the most possible evil to the human family. One proposition after
another was made, till finally Satan himself thought of a plan. He would
take the fruit of the vine, also wheat, and other things given by God as
food, and would convert them into poisons, which would ruin man's
physical, mental, and moral powers, and so overcome the senses that
Satan should have full control."—Temperance, p. 12.
    Some studies seem to indicate that a little fermented wine with a meal
is good for the heart. Is alcohol ever an acceptable medicine, though?
According to Ellen White, the answer is No. "Physicians are respon-
sible for making many drunkards. Knowing what drink will do for its
lovers, they have taken upon themselves the responsibility of prescrib-
ing it for their patients. Did they reason from cause to effect, they would
know that stimulants would have the same effect on every organ of the
body as they have on the whole man."—Temperance, p. 42.
   *"Drunkenness has killed more men than all of history's wars."
—General John J. Pershing.
   *"The sight of a drunkard is a better sermon against that vice than
the best sermon that was ever preached on that subject."—Sarah E.
Saville.
   *"Whisky is a good thing in its place. There is nothing like it for
preserving a man when he is dead. If you want to keep a dead man, put
him in whisky; if you want to kill a live [man], put whisky in him."
   Thomas Guthrie.

    Intemperance occurs to a large extent at the social level.
 What solutions can we suggest and personally implement to
 alleviate this problem?

TEMPTATION TO SEXUAL LUST (Prov. 5:1-9).

   "Much of the book of Proverbs is devoted to warnings against illicit
sex experience. Sexual sins are considered especially deadly. More
space is given to the warnings against this kind of sin than against any
other.
   "These warnings are addressed entirely to men. Here women are the
seducers. Men are tempted either by a prostitute or by an adulteress.
More often it is a married woman who is using her wiles in involving
another married man. One reason why women were not warned against
the approaches of men is that the social conventions of the time were
believed to protect and guard the woman who wanted to live a chaste
life. A stronger reason why these warnings were addressed to men only
was that it was an age of male supremacy, and only the men were given
the benefit of the instruction of the sages. Today a modern parent
would be as eager to warn his daughter against the dangers of illicit sex
expression as he would be to instruct his son in the evils of promis-
cuity. . . .
    "Illicit sex experience was considered foolish since it led to some
very undesirable consequences. Instead of pointing out moral factors
and the wrong that is done to others, Proverbs here [5:1-23] appeals to
self-interest."—The Interpreter's Bible, vol. 4, pp. 812-814.

   How can we protect ourselves from temptation to sexual immo-
rality? Prov. 5:3-9.


    In the cities of the world today, sexual indulgence is brazenly adver-
tised as a normal aspect of human existence. Television programs, films,
magazines, newspapers, theatrical performances, and billboard ads capi-
talize on the human fascination with physical beauty and sexual satis-
faction. For the masses of humanity, long gone is the biblical principle
that sex is a gift of God to be exercised only within a happy marriage.
Long gone is the principle taught by Jesus that covetous thought
regarding the opposite sex is sin.

   How do you as a Christian cope with the sexual bombardment of the
modern world? Do you find yourself unconsciously tolerating atti-
tudes and practices that you cannot change? Do you give in to sexual
indulgence or do you resist it? How would you suggest that a sexually
motivated person control his or her natural appetites?

TREASURE THE WORD (Prov. 7:1-5).

     Based on the following texts, explain what can keep us from sinning.

        Texts             What Keeps Us From Falling Into Sin?

     Prov. 2:10-12

     Prov. 7:1-5

     Prov. 14:16

     Prov. 16:6

   Our imaginations, our physical, emotional, and psychological im-
pulses, urge us to nourish desires that are impure and contrary to
God's will. Not all the power of brain or brawn can enable us to resist
the lure that leads to death. Only God can heal us.
   Fear is sometimes justified. A healthy respect for the danger ahead
will lead a wise person to avoid it if at all possible. In the final analysis,
however, victory over temptation is found only in honest fellowship
with Christ. "This is the victory that has overcome the world—our
faith" (1 John 5:4, NKJV). When confronted by temptation, we must
ask Jesus for the victory. (See Matt. 7:7, 8.) He is always willing to
empower those who are tempted. Having asked, we must next praise
Him for hearing and answering our prayer (see 1 Thess. 5:18), for
praise demonstrates faith!
   "Sir Matthew Hale told his children, 'If I omit reading a portion of
Scripture in the morning, it never goes well with me through the day.'
Treasure it up carefully, not on our shelves, but in our hearts. Let the
whole Word of God be our precious treasure. Receive the promises from
His grace with simple trust and the commandments from His holiness
with ready obedience. Stand with your eye in the land of promise; but
with your feet 'on level ground.' .. . If wisdom is not loved, lust will be
indulged. The Bible therefore—not merely read, but the cherished
object of familiar conversation—proves a sacred exorcist to expel the
power of evil."—Charles Bridges, A Modern Study in the Book of
Proverbs (Milford, Mich.: Mott Media, 1978), pp. 82, 83.

   Psalm 119 is labeled in many Bibles as "meditations on the
excellencies of the Word of God." In verse 11, David exclaims,
"Your word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin
against you" (NKJV). In what different ways can we hide God's
Word in our hearts? How is His Word a lamp to our feet and a
light to our path? (v. 105).

SURE DEFENSES (Prov. 14:7; 23:17).

   In yesterday's lesson, we studied how treasuring God's Word is a
sure defense against temptation. What else guards against evil? Prov.
14:7; 16:29, 30; 22:24, 25.


   The British poet John Donne wrote that "no man is an island." This
is certainly true when it comes to the influence we all have on one
another, for we are all influenced negatively or positively by our asso-
ciates. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the German poet and philoso-
pher, stated, "We are shaped and fashioned by the things we love,"
and most assuredly that is true regarding the people we love. While we
are not to be exclusive in our social lives, we should form our closest
friendships with those who will be a help on our journey, rather than a
hindrance. (See 2 Cor. 6:14.)
    It is not always possible to avoid situations to which we would
rather not be exposed. However, with the Lord in our hearts, we can be
on guard and inaccessible to wrong influences.

   How does Proverbs 23:17 portray the constant communion between
the true believers and their Lord?


   The Lord promises to deliver us when Satan tempts us (1 Cor.
10:13). "When the soul surrenders itself to Christ, a new power takes
possession of the new heart. . . . It is a supernatural work, bringing
a supernatural element into human nature. The soul that is yielded
to Christ becomes His own fortress, which He holds in a revolted
world, and He intends that no authority shall be known in it but His
own. . . . But unless we do yield ourselves to the control of Christ, we
shall be dominated by the wicked one. . . . We may leave off many
bad habits, for the time we may part company with Satan; but without
a vital connection with God, through the surrender of ourselves to
Him moment by moment, we shall be overcome."—The Desire of
Ages, p. 324.

   How do you maintain your Christian principles when you cannot
avoid those who do not accept Christ?


    What approaches would you suggest in relating to the follow-
 ing people: (1) a spouse who is not a believer; (2) an employer
 who does not respect your religious convictions; (3) a close friend
 who feels your religion is unimportant to daily life?

   "Through intemperance, Satan works to destroy the mental and
moral powers that God gave to man as a priceless endowment. Thus it
becomes impossible for men to appreciate things of eternal worth.
Through sensual indulgence, Satan seeks to blot from the soul every
likeness to God."—The Desire of Ages, p. 122.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. This week's lesson discussed temperance in terms of alcohol
     and sexual lust. List and discuss other areas for problems with
     intemperance.

     2. Many people who have succumbed to intemperate, addictive be-
        haviors find help in 12-step programs.* These steps are: (1)
        admit that you were powerless over alcohol (drugs, etc.); (2)
        believe that a Power greater than yourself can restore your
        sanity; (3) decide to turn your will and life over to God's care;
        (4) make a searching and fearless moral inventory of yourself;
        (5) admit to God, to yourself, and to another person the exact
        nature of your wrongs; (6) be entirely ready to have God remove
        all these defects of character; (7) humbly ask Him to remove
        your shortcomings; (8) list all persons you have harmed and be
        willing to make amends to them; (9) make direct amends to
        these people except when to do so would injure them or others;
        (10) continue to take personal inventory, and when you are
        wrong, promptly admit it; (11) seek through prayer and medita-
        tion to improve your contact with God, praying to understand
        His will for you and for the power to live accordingly; (12) share
        this message with others and practice these principles in all
        aspects of life. *(Adapted from the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics

                    A Faithful Bus Driver
                            J. H. Zachary

    Sachu believed that salvation came from total devotion to Muruga,
the Hindu god he worshiped. He had made 16 pilgrimages to
Muruga's distant shrine, determined to earn salvation through
total obedience to Muruga.
    Then one day Sachu's neighbor told him, "Muruga is not the
true god; Jesus is." The neighbor told him many stories about
Jesus from the Bible. Sachu noticed parallels between the Hindu
sacred writings and the stories his neighbor told him about Jesus.
    One day Sachu's neighbor invited him to attend the Adventist
church. "I will come if your Jesus will relieve me from my bus
duty on Saturday," Sachu told his neighbor. He was certain that
this would never happen, for he always worked on Saturday.
    But when he reported for work on Saturday morning, he found
that he had not been assigned to work that day. Stunned, Sachu
returned home to keep his promise to his neighbor and go to
church. He was impressed with the Christians' worship service
and began attending regularly.
    Abraham, a blind church member, spent time talking with Sachu
about spiritual matters. Sachu was surprised to find that the Bible
contained so many answers to his questions and taught many of the
same principles that Hindus teach, such as ceremonial uncleanness,
tithing, and Saturday worship. Before long Sachu committed his
heart to Christ and followed His command to be baptized.
    Friends, family members, and his supervisors at work perse-
cuted Sachu until he thought he would break under the pressure.
 But his friend Abraham helped him realize that his life and all he
 had belonged to God and that he must trust God.
    Sachu dedicated his talents and his time to God. He began
 spending his time caring for the sick, visiting the lonely, and
 encouraging the discouraged. As his ministry grew, he cut back
 his work hours to make time to serve God. Many months he
 receives only half his normal salary, for he spends the rest of his
 time meeting the needs of the suffering ones in his community.
 People have begun calling Sachu their "elder brother."
    Sachu testifies, "I have never been happier than when I am
 serving Jesus. I do not work for God to earn salvation; I serve God
 because He has made my salvation certain."

     Your Choices Determine
          Your Destiny




Sabbath Afternoon
GOD'S LAW IS BINDING UPON ALL CREATION. Because
Proverbs is such a practical book, it tends to deal with absolutes and
ultimates. In effect, it says to us, "This is what will happen if you do
that." We see this in its references to God's law. The guidelines for
human life, as well as the principles governing matter and energy, are
in accordance with this law.
   Of course, there are always some who choose to disregard God's
law. Solomon calls such people "fools," because in their quest for
freedom, they become victims and captives. We cannot break God's law
without suffering the consequences. Because it stands forever, the
results of choosing to disregard it are inevitable.
   As you study this week's lesson, remember that our salvation rests
upon our willingness to enter into a faith relationship with God that
results in conformity to His law.

THE DIVINE STANDARD, PART 1 (Prov. 3:1-8).

   The term law raises varied mental images in different people. Some
envision row upon row of massive bound volumes in an attorney's
library. To others, it brings to mind discussions regarding the law in
the Bible, whether moral or ceremonial. Still others are fascinated by
the laws that govern the natural world. Which of these are God's
laws? To which are we rightfully accountable?

   Why is it important to live by God's law? How can we obey His
law?

   Prov. 4:1-4

   Prov. 6:20-23

   Prov. 7:1-5

   Prov. 13:13-15

   In the book of Proverbs, we listen to a wise father teaching his child
about God's law. Proverbs includes mothers as teachers of God's law,
as it does all adults in Israel. Such teaching impresses upon young
minds the great truths of God's Word, never to be erased.
   Some Bible students have concluded that the Old Testament pre-
sents law as the means of salvation, while the New Testament presents
grace. Such a distinction is unbiblical. We can obey God's holy law
only by trusting in the Lord (Prov. 3:5). As the believer acknowledges
the Lord in all of his or her ways, "He [God] shall direct your paths"
(v. 6, NKJV). Only the one who fears (has reverence for) the Lord is
able to "depart from evil" (v. 7). Fear of the Lord is the living faith of
which the New Testament speaks. It results in choosing to obey God's
law. (See Rom. 3:31.)

    Proverbs 3:1, 2 suggests that obedience to God's law helps us
 live a long life. Verse 8 takes verse 2 a step further, stating that
 keeping God's law "will bring . . . nourishment to your bones"
 (NIV). Do you think this really means that following God's laws
 will make us healthier physically?

                                                                       39

THE DIVINE STANDARD, PART 2 (Rom. 7:12, 14).

   What attributes of God's law does Paul mention in Romans
7:12, 14?


   All of God's laws work in harmony with each other and reveal His
character of love and the order in His kingdom. The laws of nature are
God's laws as surely as is the Decalogue. No conflict exists between
true religion and true science, for God is the Author of both.

     How does Psalm 19:1-3, 7 illustrate the working of God's law?


   "We would do well to read often the nineteenth psalm that we may
understand how the Lord binds up His law with His created works."
—Ellen G. White Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p.
1143.
   Just as a thistle lies dormant in its seed, so death is inherently bound
up in sin. The declaration, "The soul who sins is the one who will die"
(Ezek. 18:4, NIV) is not a threat of punishment but a warning of natural
consequences. While God desires obedience born of love rather than of
fear, at the same time He wants us to be able to make intelligent choices.
He tells us what will be the ultimate consequence of obedience and
disobedience and leaves us free to decide between the two.

     How do Isaiah 5:1, 2 and Matthew 21:33 symbolize God's law?


    The vineyard represents God's chosen people, Israel. "To this people
were committed the oracles of God. They were hedged about by the
precepts of His law, the everlasting principles of truth, justice, and
purity. Obedience to these principles was to be their protection, for it
would save them from destroying themselves by sinful practices."
—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 287, 288.
    "That law of ten precepts of the greatest love that can be presented
to man is the voice of God from heaven speaking to the soul in promise,
`This do, and you will not come under the dominion and control of
Satan.' There is not a negative in that law, although it may appear thus.
It is DO, and Live."—Ellen G. White Comments, The SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 1, p. 1105.

   What provision has God made that we may be able to live
 according to His law? Heb. 8:10; Ezek. 36:26. How have you
 availed yourself of this provision lately?

THE FOLLY OF LAWLESSNESS (Prov. 15:21).

  The book of Proverbs refers to fools, folly, and foolishness in 84
verses. This is 9 percent of the book. The authors of Proverbs must
have been impressed with the seriousness of being a fool!

  How does the fool relate to wisdom and understanding? Prov. 17:16,
24; 23:9; 24:7.


   "In the gate they do not open their mouths" (Prov. 24:7, NRSV).
"The wise men and judges sat in counsel in the city gates, where
business was made legal and public matters were discussed. The fool
would have nothing to contribute.
   " 'Silence is the virtue of fools.' It is also a virtue of the wise (see
17:27). So a silent fool and a wise man can very seldom be told apart. As
long as a fool keeps quiet and nods wisely now and again, he can enjoy
the esteem held out to a wise man of sound judgment and few words
(17:28). If the fool, however, picked up this pearl of wisdom in a rare
moment of attention in the classroom, we should not be too hopeful
that he will keep his mouth shut. He could not possibly conceive that it
applied to him. In any case, he has a happy knack of picking up words of
wisdom and letting them drop at all the wrong times and places. He
thinks he is being very clever when he can come out with a pithy
saying, but it invariably falls flat on its face (26:7) and makes not the
slightest impact (26:9). So even if the fool says something wise, his
sense of timing will usually give him away."—Kenneth T. Aitken,
Proverbs (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1986), pp. 98, 99.

   Proverbs mentions several things that are inappropriate for a fool.
List the ones found in Proverbs 19:10; 26:1, 7-9.


   People who are wise in their own conceit cannot be told anything,
however desperate the situation. Proverbs graphically describes their
tendencies (17:12, 21; 26:6, 11, 12; 27:3). Because fools choose to reject
God's love and law, there is no way for them to enjoy eternity with the
righteous. When the Lord repays "according to everyone's work"
(Rev. 21:12, NRSV), fools, being "an abomination," will be shut out from
the kingdom of glory (21:7).
    One characteristic shared by all fools is the tendency to
 substitute their own way for God's way. How would you help a
 fool? What approaches would you use to wean a foolish person
 away from folly?

                                                                        41

THE REAPING TIME, PART 1 (Prov. 22:8).

  What sharp contrasts between the righteous and the wicked does
Proverbs draw?

     Prov. 10:24, 25


     Prov. 10:27-30


     Prov. 11:6


    God is the ultimate Source of truth, righteousness, and everlasting
life. To commit oneself to His principles, to choose righteousness as a
way of life, to follow His directions for success, and live with Him in a
fellowship of trust and admiration is to connect one's soul with the
Infinite One and share in His life. On the other hand, to choose a
lifestyle opposed to the principles of life, to despise righteousness and
live for self, is to cut off one's soul from its Source, a choice which
ultimately can end only in destruction.

  By what are all people judged, and according to what are they
rewarded? Why? Prov. 12:14; 24:12; James 2:12, 13; Rev. 22:12.


    We are saved by grace, not by works of the law. (See Rom. 3:20; Gal.
2:16; Eph. 2:8-10.) The experience of salvation by grace, however,
results in obedience to God's law. (See Rom. 8:1-4.) Works of faith
demonstrate that Christ's grace is operating in the life to bring us into
accord with the righteous principles of His law. We are judged by the
law, the great standard of righteousness because Christ's grace has
been made available as the power to obey it. Our works are judged
because grace makes possible works that are acceptable to God.
   Obedience is a sign of our love for God (John 14:15) and of our
willingness to render Him true worship. Obedience through the power
of the Holy Spirit is not legalism. "Those who obey his commands live
in him, and he in them. And this is how we know that he lives in us: We
know it by the Spirit he gave us" (1 John 3:24, NIV).

    How would you explain to a friend that God's grace saves us
 from the penalty of sin, from the power of sin, and from the
 presence of sin? What texts would you use in your explanation?

THE REAPING TIME, PART 2 (Prov. 11:3; 15:25).

   Who destroys the wicked? Prov 11:3; 15:25.


    In the book of Proverbs, we find evidence for two distinct views of
the judgment. One places the responsibility for destruction on God; the
other places the responsibility on sinners themselves. Could it be that
Solomon and the other writers of Proverbs are presenting two sides of
the same coin?
    "When a man has given his heart to his Saviour, when his only aim in
life is to please God, then he need have no fear that he will be led astray
(John 7:17; Isa. 30:21). On the other hand, the persistent disobedience
of the sinner . . . leads him into eternal destruction in the great
consummation."—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 983.
    Mercy and justice work together in the operation of law. Therefore,
mercy, no less than justice, designates the end of those who reject that
law. God is responsible in that He designed the laws in the first place—
a description of how the universe works. But He also built into the
system freedom of choice, which gives individuals ultimate responsi-
bility for their destiny. In the final end of the wicked, God gives them
over to the consequences of their foolish choices: eternal annihilation.

  What plea does the Lord make with those whose foolish choices
are leading to destruction? Ezek. 33:11.


    Sin becomes unpardonable only because the sinner chooses to
reject pardon. With every knock on the heart's door, unheeded, the
inclination to open the door becomes weaker. The impressions of the
Holy Spirit, disregarded, will not be as easily distinguished the next
time. The heart becomes less and less impressionable.
    Finally, God must say "They are joined to their idols; let them go."
His heart of love, however cries, "Oh, how can I give them up! How can
I let them go!" (See Hos. 4:17; 11:8.)
    "The thirty-third chapter of Ezekiel shows that God's government is
a government of personal responsibility. Each one must stand for him-
self. No one can obey for his neighbor. No one is excused for neglecting
his duty because of a similar neglect on the part of his neighbor."
—Ellen G. White Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 1164.

    Each day presents us with many choices that will lead us
 down one path or the other. Pray that God will help you to make
 the best choices.


                                                                         43

FURTHER STUDY: Read the following examples regarding the
importance of making good choices. How do these examples help you
to understand what motivates our choices? Lot: Genesis. 13:1-12; 29;
Mary and Martha: Luke 10:38-42; Moses: Hebrews. 11:24-28.
   Regarding some of the first choices ever made, read Patriarchs and
Prophets, "The Creation," pp. 44-51.

   "The history of nations that one after another have occupied their
allotted time and place, unconsciously witnessing to the truth of which
they themselves knew not the meaning, speaks to us. To every nation
and to every individual of today God has assigned a place in His great
plan. Today men and nations are being measured by the plummet in
the hand of Him who makes no mistake. All are by their own choice
deciding their destiny, and God is overruling all for the accomplish-
ment of His purposes."—Education, p. 170.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. This week we studied that God's law is like a hedge or wall. Is
     this to say that God's law is a wall of resistance, a wall of
     isolation from sin, a wall of isolation from the world, or a wall
     of protection? Explain your answer. In what other positive
     terms would you describe God's law, and why?

     2. Why is Solomon correct in the contrasts he makes between
        wisdom and folly?

     3. Is it important for Christians to offer nonviolent opposition
        to those within and without the church who limit religious
        liberty or to those who neglect or abuse the downtrodden of
        society? Explain your answer. How do we relate such needs
        to "not resisting evil"?

SUMMARIZE this week's lesson by completing the following sen-
tences: (1) The choices we make
(2) It is important to keep God's law because
(3) The folly of lawlessness consists of
(4) In the end, ultimate responsibility for a person's destiny rests with

Remember that if you choose to be a fool, you will not be condemned
for your weakness but for refusing the help that God offers. However,
you can always choose to live in harmony with the laws of life and
receive the necessary help from God to choose the harvest unto eternal
life.

            Malawian Muslims Turn to Christ
                              Len Atkins

   Golden Lapani is a lay evangelist working in Malawi. Recently he
completed an evangelistic effort in the Muslim town of Mkwinda.
Some 254 people accepted Christ, and 48 people have already been
baptized. Among those is the Muslim sheikh who had to postpone
baptism until he could divest himself of two of his three wives and a
Muslim leader who asked many questions before he accepted Jesus
Christ as his Savior. The village chief gave land on which the believers
could build a church.
   Because so many former Muslims became Christians, the Muslim
mosque no longer was needed. It was dismantled, and the bricks were
used to build the Adventist church. Now, instead of the early morning
Muslim call to worship, villagers hear the sound of singing as voices
praise the one God in heaven.
   God has blessed Lapani with many souls during his 13 years as a
Christian. But the one he treasures the most is the conversion of one
woman.
    Edda Oliver had raised her seven children to be faithful Muslims.
But her second son, Golden, accepted Christ as his Savior and began
sharing his new faith. He won his older brother, father, and four sisters
to Christ. But his mother refused to listen when he talked about Jesus.
Golden prayed that his mother would find Jesus as her Lord.
    Then in 1998, while he was conducting a group Bible study in his
mother's village, he saw his mother sitting among the old women at
the meeting. His heart leaped. He wondered if she would disturb the
study, and he prayed that the Holy Spirit would speak to her heart.
    She listened attentively to his lesson, and when he invited those
present to accept Jesus Christ as their Lord, his mother raised her hand.
He wondered if she understood what he had said.
    After the meeting those who had indicated they wanted to accept
Christ came forward to sign their names. Lapani's mother wrote her
name as well. Then she approached her son and begged forgiveness
for having refused his invitation to accept Jesus for so long. "I have
wasted 62 years in my former faith," she told him. But all Lapani could
think of was that his 13 years of prayers had just been answered.
    Following his mother's baptism, Golden Lapani said joyfully, "Now
all my family are Adventists. God has given me a miracle today."

  Len Atkins wrote this while he served as pastor of the Kabula Hill
Adventist Church and chaplain at Blantyre Adventist Hospital in Blantyre,
Malawi. He has since returned to North America.

     Live Within Your Means




Sabbath Afternoon

MANAGERS OF THE LORD'S GOODS. How we handle our money
and the way we live are closely related. Similar principles govern both.
In fact, "stewardship" is not merely a matter of finances. It also relates
to every aspect of life—time, talent, energy, and influence.
   Undergirding and enabling the true stewardship of life is the under-
standing that "the earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof; the
world, and they that dwell therein" (Ps. 24:1). We are not owners but
managers of the Lord's goods. As Christians, we have accepted the
responsibility of acting in the Master's stead, doing as He would do
were He presiding directly over His own. As stewards, then, we
should be interested to hear the counsel of the Owner, to learn what
His priorities are, what methods bring the most permanent benefits,
and how best to represent Him in all we do.

HONOR THE LORD (Prov. 3:9, 10).

   "Bible religion is to be interwoven with all we do or say. Divine
and human agencies are to combine in temporal as well as in spiritual
achievements. They are to be united in all human pursuits, in mechani-
cal and agricultural labors, in mercantile and scientific enterprises."
—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 349, 350.

   Describe one way we can honor the Lord. Prov. 3:9.


   "[God's] glory must be the motive of all who are laborers together
with Him. All our work is to be done from love to God and in
accordance with His will. . . .
   "But God will not accept the greatest talents or the most splendid
service unless self is laid upon the altar."—Christ's Object Lessons,
p. 350.

   What results does God promise if we honor the Lord? Prov.
3:10; 10:3; Mal. 3:10, 11.


   Many and varied are the blessings God pours out upon those who
honor and trust Him. Sometimes He gives temporal prosperity. Some-
times, for reasons we do not understand, He withholds it. He always
bestows upon His faithful children forgiveness from sin and offers
assurance of eternal life.
   The experience of one literature evangelist illustrates how God hon-
ors those who honor Him: "I recall having visited homes all day,
introducing The Desire of Ages, without one interest. How was I ever
going to earn enough money to make a living? But deciding to adopt a
different strategy, I kept at it. At around 6:00 p.m., I was struggling to
give yet another presentation, this time praying that the woman to
whom I was speaking would accept the book and the truth it contained.
   "She replied, 'Yes, I'll order it. My family needs it.' I was enliv-
ened and refreshed. I went next door and once again prayed for the
person to whom I was giving the presentation. That person also bought
the book. By 7:15 p.m., I had visited four more homes, receiving
orders in each of them. Three of those families later took Bible
studies, and four persons joined the church."
    When we keep our focus on the spiritual goal of witnessing, the
 Lord consistently supplies the need.

   If you have little or nothing of this world's goods, how can
 you follow the instruction to "honor the Lord with your wealth"
 (Prov. 3:9, NIV)?

                                                                       47

THE LOVE OF MONEY (Prov. 11:28).

   Explain how the love of money is "the root of all evil" (1 Tim.
6:10). Prov. 28:20, 22.


   The material status of an individual does not necessarily indicate the
direction of her or his affections. A poor person can love money as
dearly as a rich person, perhaps even more so. The danger lies in
misplaced priorities, often leading to dishonest means of acquiring
more money.

  What principle, applied to business, shields a person from being
"eager to get rich" (Prov. 28:20, NIV)? Prov. 13:11.


   It is rarely easy to be patient! But far better to make progress slowly
than to damage one's character by sinful, hasty acquisition.
   "It is abomination to fools to depart from evil" (Prov. 13:19). "The
very idea that he [the fool] should behave in any other way is unthink-
able to him, quite abhorrent in fact (13:19); for he thinks it would soil his
fun (10:23) and make life very drab (15:21)."—Kenneth T. Aitken,
Proverbs (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1986), p. 100.

  What is the ultimate end of anyone who trusts in riches? Prov.
11:28; 23:4, 5.


    To many of Jesus' hearers, the present life was all that existed, and
providing for its temporal needs was all that mattered. As something
strange and new, Jesus' words fell on the ears of the wondering multi-
tude. (See Matt. 6:24-34.) He taught that even as this earth offers no
permanent safety for material possessions, so it can provide no eternal
refuge for the soul. Our hearts will be where our treasure is. In view of
this fact, Jesus recommended we store up our treasure in heaven, seek
first God's kingdom, and not be anxious about our needs.

   In your view, why does the Lord allow some people to be wealthier
than others? What is the responsibility of rich believers in Christ to
their poorer sisters and brothers? Should they give them all their
money? Explain your answer.


   What is the responsibility of poor believers to the rich? Should
they regard themselves as inferior? Explain your answer.

Tuesday                                            November 7
GENEROSITY AND CONTENTMENT (Pros'. 11:24. 25).

  Why is it important to share? Prov. 11:24, 25; 22:9; 28:27.


   Jesus taught that we should not favor the rich for the sake of social
acceptance. We have a responsibility to minister to the poor.
   What does it mean to be a Christian? "It is to be Christlike, to do
others good, to be divested of all selfishness, and to have our lives
marked with acts of disinterested benevolence [free from self-interest].
Our Redeemer throws souls into the arms of the church, for them to care
for unselfishly and train for heaven, and thus be co-workers with Him.
But the church too often thrusts them away, upon the devil's battle-
field. . . . Cannot God return into their granaries and increase their
flocks, so that instead of loss there shall be increase?"—Testimonies
for the Church, vol. 2, p. 331.

  If we do not have a lot of money and material possessions, what else
can we share? Prov. 25:25; 31:9.


   Be generous, and give what you have—even if it is only good news
or a smile and a greeting! Try to understand the inner needs of each
individual you meet. Look beneath the surface. Ask for divine help
that you may strengthen, cheer, and help the needy person to the best
of your ability and according to that person's needs. When possible,
help others to help themselves. William Booth, founder of the Salva-
tion Army, offered "soup, soap, and salvation," in that order.
   Plead the cause of the needy to those who may be better able to
assist. And above all, deal with the needy in such a manner as to
represent the Father in heaven: with genuine caring, mercy, and justice.

  What assurance does Proverbs give to anyone obliged to live in
poverty? Prov. 15:16; 16:8; 28:6 (see also Heb. 13:5).


   A graceful, positive attitude, whatever the circumstances of our
lives, is a source of health and happiness. (See Prov. 15:15; 30:7-9.)

  How can you testify to the Lord's many blessings in times when you
have been poor?


   How can you testify to the joy you experienced as you shared
 with someone more needy than yourself?

                                                                      49

WORK AND PLAN AHEAD (Prov. 14:15; 22:3).

  What basic principle does Proverbs 27:18 illustrate? Compare
James 5:1-6.


   "Every laborer is to receive his or her just due. It may be thought to
be a good plan to allow persons to give talent and earnest labor to the
work of God, while they draw nothing from the treasury. But this is
making a difference, and selfishly withholding from such workers their
due. God will not put His sanction on any such plan."—Evangelism,
p. 491.

  How does a person who is wise relate to the future? Prov. 14:15;
22:3.


   There is wisdom in planning for the future. To put aside savings to
take care of future expenses is not contrary to God's will. Insofar as
this is possible, it is the wise thing to do.
   The counsel Ellen White gave to one person applies, in prin-
ciple, to each of us: "Every week you should lay by in some secure
place five or ten dollars not to be used up unless in case of
sickness. With economy you may place something at interest.
With wise management you can save something after paying your
debts."—Selected Messages, book 2, p. 329.

   What warning does Proverbs 28:8 give us about wrong methods of
earning money?


   Usury is lending money at interest. Today it sometimes refers to
lending at a rate of interest that is excessive or unlawfully high.
   "The Israelites lived in a simple state of society, and hence they were
encouraged to lend to each other in a friendly way, without any hope of
gain. But the case was different with foreigners, who engaged in trade
and commerce, borrowed to enlarge their capital, and might reasonably
be expected to pay interest on their loans. Besides, the distinction was
admirably conducive to keeping the Israelites separate from the rest of
the world."—Robert Jamieson, A. R. Fausset, David Brown, Com-
mentary on the Whole Bible (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan, n.d.),
p. 136.

   How can we apply God's counsel to Israel regarding usury to
 our financial practices today?

DEBT AND "SURETY" (Prov. 22:7; 6:1-5).

   Why do you think "the borrower is servant to the lender"?
(Prov. 22:7).


   In a letter written in 1877, Ellen White counseled an individual, "Be
determined never to incur another debt. Deny yourself a thousand
things rather than run in debt. . . . Avoid it as you would the small-
pox."—Counsels on Stewardship, p. 257.
   On the other hand, White also wrote, "To make no move that calls for the
investment of means unless we have the money in hand to complete the
contemplated work, should not always be considered the wisest plan. . . .
   "It is right to borrow money to carry forward a work that we know God
desires to have accomplished. We should not wait in inconvenience, and
make the work much harder, because we do not wish to borrow money.
Mistakes have been made in incurring debt to do that which could well
have waited till a future time. But there is danger of going to the other
extreme. We are not to place ourselves in a position that will endanger
health and make our work wearing. We are to act sensibly. We must do the
work that needs to be done, even if we have to borrow money and pay
interest."—Counsels on Stewardship, pp. 277, 278.

   What counsel does the wise man give regarding the risk involved in
acceptance of legal responsibility for someone else's debt? Prov. 6:1-
5; 11:15; 17:18.


   A "surety" (KJV) is someone who has become legally liable for
another person's debt, responsible for guaranteed payment even if that
person must take it out of his or her own pocket. This can become a
dangerous snare, especially in the case of guaranteeing payment on
behalf of a stranger. While we are to "bear one another's burdens," the
Lord does not expect us to be responsible for another's foolishness.
   "There is no indication here [Prov. 6:1-5] that a person should
never help another to carry a debt [see 14:21; 17:17; 18:24; 27:10].
Times may come when a great favor can be done to someone who
needs to borrow money and who needs someone to underwrite the
debt. But such a commitment ought not to be thoughtlessly under-
taken."—The Interpreter's Bible, vol. 4, p. 817.

    Examine your spending habits prayerfully. Are you living out-
 side of your means at the expense of cheating God? (Mal. 3:8-10).
 What can you do without, and what steps can you take to begin
 doing so?

                                                                         51

FURTHER STUDY: How do the following verses add to our under-
standing of this week's topic: 2 Corinthians 8:9; Galatians 2:10;
2 Thessalonians 3:6-12; 1 Timothy 6:6-10, 17, 18; James 2:1-6; Rev-
elation 2:9; 3:14-18.
   Also read the sections titled "Money" in Christ's Object Lessons,
p. 351, 352; "Usury," Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1, pp. 534-536;
and "Business Integrity," The Adventist Home, pp. 391-394.

   "It is no better than sacrilege for a man to take from God's treasury in
order to serve himself or to serve others in their secular business.. . . Let
no one, when brought into a strait place, take money consecrated to
religious purposes, and use it for his advantage, soothing his con-
science by saying that he will repay it at some future time. Far better to
cut down the expenses to correspond with the income, to restrict the
wants, and live within the means, than to use the Lord's money for
secular purposes."—Counsels on Stewardship, p. 79.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How can we teach to others the principle that God honors
     those who honor Him as part of God's message for believers
     in the last days?

     2. Does occasional giving fulfill a person's duty to work for those
        in need? Why, or why not?

     3. Why do Christians have a responsibility to help others?

     4. Discuss what is wrong with keeping up with your neighbors and
        friends in terms of material possessions.

     5. "Plan your work and work your plan" is a sound business
        principle. How can we apply it to the Christian lifestyle?

SUMMARIZE this week's lesson by indicating whether each of the
following statements is true (T) or false (F). Then rewrite the statements
that are false to make them true.          My money and all my posses-
sions are my own to be used as I deem necessary.           Money is only
as valuable as it is used for good purposes.             The security of
treasure on earth is not a valid indicator of where I should place my
priorities.        To share what I have with someone in need will not
necessarily deplete my own resources.           God designed work to be
a blessing to us.       Planning ahead is denying that we need to rely
on God for our needs.          Debt is sometimes necessary and justifi-
able.

                           Some Seeds Take Time
                                Mere Narabe

          Several years ago while Mere Narabe was teaching school in an
      Adventist village in Fiji, she felt a burden for a neighboring village that
      had no Adventists. She started a story hour there on Sabbath after-
      noons. She went alone to the village and invited the children to join her
      for songs and stories from the Bible.
          She started her story hour in the local school teacher's house, but so
      many children came that the teacher's house could not hold them all.
      The school teacher arranged for her to hold her meetings in the
      basement of the village church.
          One girl, Susi, attended regularly until her grandmother learned
      about it and told her she could not attend. But Susi was determined to
      come. She would sneak away from her work and stand outside the
      church, listening through the window.
          Mere knew nothing about Susi 's plan. She only knew that the girl's
      grandmother had told her she could not come any longer. But Susi
      faithfully came every week.
          After holding the story hour for several months, Mere Narabe had
      to stop because of commitments at her own school. She often won-
      dered whether the story hour had made any difference in the lives of
      the children who attended.
          Then last year Mere returned to the village, where there is now an
      Adventist church. During the church service the congregation enjoyed
      a time of testimonies. One young woman stood and told how she had
      first learned about the Adventist truth. She said, "When I was a child a
      woman came to our village to hold a Bible story hour for children. My
      grandmother found out where I was and prohibited me from coming
      any more, but I continued to come and stood outside to listen. It was
      there that I learned to love Jesus, and I learned about the Sabbath.
      When the Adventists came to our village, I knew that they were
      teaching the truth, and I joined the church. My husband and children
      and I are Adventists today because of that story hour."
                                     The young woman was Susi. Later she
                                  told Mere that most of the other children who
                                  had attended the story hour had eventually
                                  become Adventists too.
                                      Mere had conducted this story hour for
                                  just three months. Yet the seeds that God
                                  planted during those happy times bore fruit in
                                  years to come.

                                    Mere Narabe (left) is a teacher in Fiji.

     As the Needle to the Pole



Sabbath Afternoon
GOD IS THE ULTIMATE MODEL OF INTEGRITY. "God is light
and in Him is no darkness at all" (1 John 1:5). James refers to "the Father
of all lights, with whom there is never the slightest variation or shadow
of inconsistency" (James 1:17b, Philips). Eugene Peterson renders the
same verse, "There is nothing deceitful in God, nothing two-faced,
nothing fickle" (The Message). God is the epitome of authenticity.
   As King of the universe, God is also the Pattern for rulers and
persons of authority on earth, mingling justice and mercy, righteous-
ness and peace. Revenge is a temptation to those with power, as is
deceit, but those who are committed to integrity find that "God keeps
his promise, and he will not allow you to be tested beyond your power
to remain firm; at the time you are put to the test, he will give you the
strength to endure it, and so provide you a way out" (1 Cor. 10:13,
TEV).
   The majority of us are not "kings," but we do bear various levels of
responsibility. Integrity is for us, as well.
   "The greatest want of the world is the want of men—men who will
not be bought or sold, men who in their inmost souls are true and
honest, men who do not fear to call sin by its right name, men whose
conscience is true to duty as the needle to the pole, men who will
stand for the right though the heavens fall."—Education, p. 57 (em-
phasis supplied).

THE KING—THE MODEL FOR HIS PEOPLE, PART 1 (Prov.
29:2).

   In Bible times, both in Israel and other nations, kings were supreme
judges. The author of most of the proverbs was a king whose wise
judgments were recorded for future generations, but Solomon was not
always wise. Tragically, he wandered away from God's ideal of just and
faithful kingship.
   The practices of the king usually became those of his people. He
either set a pattern of purity, truth, justice, and honesty, or he led his
people down the path of disloyalty to God into impurity, idolatry,
injustice, and dishonesty.

   In what type of king do the people rejoice? Prov. 29:2.


   Of course, none of us are kings, but each of us can appreciate a just
ruler. Moreover, God gives each of us some responsibility, some impor-
tant trust for which we are accountable to the Master. In the advice
given for long-ago rulers, we will discover valuable gems that can
enable us to deal fairly with those whose lives we touch.
   "Christ was establishing a kingdom on different principles. He called
men, not to authority, but to service, the strong to bear the infirmities of
the weak. Power, position, talent, education, placed their possessor
under greater obligation to serve his fellows."—The Desire of Ages,
p. 550.

   By what is the king preserved? Prov. 20:28.


   Proverbs 20:28 mentions the characteristics of God. (See Ps. 85:9,
10.) The delightful paradox is that God is both perfectly just and perfectly
merciful. He is so just that He cannot save for eternity a sinner who
refuses to accept His atonement for sin. He is so merciful that He can
forgive completely and restore to Himself the one who accepts the atone-
ment provided by His Son. (See John 3:16, 36.)
   "It is the mingling of judgment and mercy that makes salvation full
and complete. It is the blending of the two that leads us, as we view the
world's Redeemer and the law of Jehovah, to exclaim, 'Thy gentleness
hath made me great.' "—Ellen G. White Comments, The SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1072.

   We may not have a choice regarding the appointment of
 earthly "kings" under whom we live. What two choices, how-
 ever, do we have regarding spiritual "kings"?

                                                                          57

THE KING—THE MODEL FOR HIS PEOPLE, PART 2 (Prov.
20:8).

     List what a good king should do.

     Prov. 20:8

     Prov. 25:2, 4, 5

     Prov. 29:14

     Prov. 31:8, 9

   Rulers who choose to serve Christ share God's characteristics. In His
reign, Christ mingles perfect justice (Matt. 3:12) with infinite mercy
(Eph. 2:4, 5). All who enter into fellowship with the heavenly King will
exhibit the same characteristics. Because His love rules supreme in their
hearts, they are not only unwilling to deny facts but equally unwilling to
dethrone God as the ultimate Judge. Even so, secular authorities are
appointed to pass judgment on those who break the law of the land. The
church as a corporate body has the duty of deciding if a member fails to
conform to the standards governing church membership. (Compare
Matt. 7:1-5 with 1 Cor. 5:12; 6:2, 3; Rom. 13:1-4.)

   If a person in authority pays attention to false information, what will
the official who serves under that person most likely be like? Prov.
29:12. Why do you think this is so?


   Do his servants become wicked? Or are they already wicked? "A
king sets his own policy, but he must depend on information from
advisers to help him formulate that policy. If he only listens to lies from
advisers (like King Ahab who rejected the prophecy of Micaiah in
1 Kings 22), then all the men who surround him will cater to his
depravity and become wicked."—Robert L. Alden, Proverbs (Grand
Rapids, Mich.: Baker Book House, 1983), p. 201.

   In what ways may the following counsels given to kings and leaders
be applied by every Christian believer? Prov. 16:10, 12, 13; 18:5;
24:23-25; 31:3-5?


    Whatever your calling in life, how could you improve your
 effectiveness by following the instruction the book of Proverbs
 has for kings?

MERCY OR REVENGE? (Prov. 11:17).

   Explain the result of living out in one's own life the principles of
righteousness and mercy. Prov. 21:21; 11:17.


    There is nothing self-serving in the motives of the genuinely mer-
ciful person. But mercy's blessing is twofold. First, kindness reacts on
the giver in immediate happiness because mercy is always a happier
way to live. Then kindness bears fruit in the words and actions of
others in whose hearts the seed was planted, returning to refresh the
soul who sowed it there.
   Psalm 145:9 teaches that the Lord's "tender mercies are over all his
works." This means that cruelty to animals is in direct opposition to
God. Read Proverbs 12:10. God gave us dominion over the earth for
our mutual benefit, not that we might exploit or ravage it. Scripture
classifies those hunters who kill for sport and pleasure and those who
treat domestic animals cruelly as wicked.

   What are the hazards involved in harboring a spirit of revenge
toward those who have wronged us? Prov. 24:17-20.


   "Whoever does not love abides in death" (1 John 3:14, NRSV). Thus
the person who nurses a vengeful spirit is living outside of Christ. This
results in serious damage to one's physical, spiritual, and psychological
health, and ultimately, loss of eternal life. It is far better to leave an
offense with God; He will make it right. He might even win the offender!
   As Christ dwells in our hearts, He enables us to practice the counsel
He gives: "If your enemies are hungry, give them bread to eat; and if
they are thirsty, give them water to drink; for you will heap coals of fire
on their head, and the Lord will reward you" (Prov. 25:21, 22, NRSV).
   "One of the most common sins, and one that is attended with most
[destructive] results, is the indulgence of an unforgiving spirit. How
many will cherish animosity or revenge and then bow before God and
ask to be forgiven as they forgive. Surely they can have no true sense
of the import of this prayer or they would not dare to take it upon their
lips. We are dependent upon the pardoning mercy of God every day
and every hour; how then can we cherish bitterness and malice toward
our fellow sinners!"—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 170.

    Think of a situation in your life in which you showed a merci-
 ful, forgiving spirit toward someone who had wronged you.
 What was the effect of your attitude upon: (a) the person you
 forgave; (b) yourself?

                                                                        59

JUSTICE OR INJUSTICE (Prov. 21:15)?

  List some characteristics of those who are just (righteous).
Prov. 4:18; 9:9; 10:20; 20:7.


   The just are the righteous who have accepted God as their King and
who, by His grace, reflect His character. (See Isa. 51:1, 7; Rom. 8:9,
10; 10:6-10.) They can practice justice in their dealings with their
fellow human beings because the righteousness of Christ lives in their
hearts by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.
   The just and the unjust cannot respect each other's characters. (See
Prov. 29:10, 27.) Yet, the just express their genuine concern for the
unjust by praying and working for them. They truly care.

   How does Proverbs describe the unjust (the unrighteous)? Prov.
11:5-7; 28:8-10.


   The Lord never justifies the unjust, nor does He condemn the just.
"Acquitting the guilty and condemning the innocent—the Lord detests
them both" (Prov. 17:15, NIV; see also Exod. 23:7).
   Then what hope is there for us? We are all sinners in the sight of a
holy God (Rom. 3:10-19). In the light of the Old Testament teaching,
how can we explain Paul's statement, "But to one who without works
trusts him who justifies the ungodly, such faith is reckoned as
rightousness"? (Rom. 4:5, NRSV).
   The answer is that when Christ justifies the ungodly (the unjust)
they do not remain ungodly. The ungodly are unjustified, unconverted,
outside of Christ, and lost (1 Tim. 1:9; 1 Pet. 3:7). The justified have been
transformed by the power of Christ. They are now willing slaves to
righteousness (Rom. 6:17, 18). Their lives are in conformity with God's
law (Rom. 8:3, 4) because the Holy Spirit is reigning in their hearts
(vs. 9, 10).
   When probation closes a short time before Jesus' second coming,
the just (the righteous) will remain right with God for eternity and the
unjust (the wicked) will remain hateful toward God (Rev. 22:11). At the
Second Advent, the just will be translated and the unjust will be slain
by the brightness of His coming (1 Thess. 4:16-18; 2 Thess. 1:7-10).

    If an unjust person comes to you with the plea that he or she
 wishes to experience a change of character and heart, how would
 you explain from the Bible the means by which that person can
 be transformed?

HONESTY OR DECEIT? (Prov. 20:17).

  What makes a person dishonest and deceptive? Prov. 11:18, KJV;
12:5, 20.


   Unless Christ reigns supreme in a human heart, the evil one will
convey his characteristics, and there will be no fortress against decep-
tion of any form. Satan will deceive the soul, and that soul, in turn, will
practice deception.

  List some of the forms of deception practiced by those who do not
know Christ.

   Prov. 10:10

   Prov. 17:23

   Prov. 29:24


   True Christians faithfully pay their bills and refuse to be bribed in
any way. They categorically reject any of the many forms of stealing
that people practice and even consider acceptable in our world today.
This includes stealing all the credit for a job well done, even though
many others were involved in the project. Cheating on examinations or
as a means of personal advancement is totally foreign to anyone who
serves Christ.
   Spiritual toughness is needed. "There is in true Christian character
an indomitableness that cannot be molded or subdued by adverse
circumstances. We must have moral backbone, an integrity that cannot
be flattered, bribed, or terrified."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 498.

   How does the Lord bless those who are honest?

   Prov. 10:3

   Prov. 10:24

   Prov. 10:25

   Prov. 10:28-30

   How did God fulfill these promises to Israel? How does He
 keep these promises to you now and in the future?

FURTHER STUDY: Consider any or all of the following examples
of integrity these passages refer to: Numbers 16:15; 1 Samuel 12:1-4;
2 Samuel 18:9-12; 1 Kings 13:1-10; 2 Kings 5:1-16.
   Read "Lives of Great Men," in Education, pp. 51-69.

   "As far as possible, you should come into harmony with your
brethren and sisters. You should surrender yourselves to God and cease
to manifest sternness and a disposition to find fault. You should yield
your own spirit and take in its place the spirit of the dear Saviour. Reach
up and grasp His hand, that the touch may electrify you and charge you
with the sweet properties of His own matchless character. You may open
your hearts to His love, and let His power transform you and His grace
be your strength. Then will you have a powerful influence for good.
Your moral strength will be equal to the closest test of character. Your
integrity will be pure and sanctified. Then will your light break forth
as the morning."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, p. 63.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What truth is there for today's church leaders in the fact that
     the practices of the king usually became those of his people? Do
     we as church members have the right to expect church leaders
     to set a pattern of purity, truth, justice, and honesty? Explain.
     What should we do if they do not? Is our spirituality dependent
     upon theirs? Explain.

     2. Being kind benefits us not only spiritually but physically. How
        is this so?

     3. Proverbs 4:18 says that the "path of the righteous [the just] is
        like the first gleam of dawn, shining ever brighter till the full
        light of day." How is this so?

     4. Proverbs 10:28 talks about the hope of the righteous. What is
        this hope? See Joel 3:16; Galatians 5:5; Ephesians 2:12, 13;
        Colossians 1:27; 1 Thessalonians 5:8; 1 Timothy 1:1; Titus
        1:2; 2:13. What common thread runs through all of these
        verses?

SUMMARIZE this week's lesson by examining your heart with the
following questions: Am I God's friend as God considers true friend-
ship? Do I receive favors from God without acknowledging their Source?
Am I as ready to extend finite, human mercy as I am to ask for God's
forgiveness and mercy? How can I in my inmost soul be as true to duty
as the needle to the pole? Were the final decision of the judgment to be
made today, where would I find my place?

                             J. H. Zachary

   Most of us live in a world isolated from the tragedies that befall
Christians in other lands. For several years increased violence against
Christians in India received little public notice until an evangelical
missionary, Graham Staines, and his two young sons were burned
alive in their jeep by a group of Hindu extremists early in 1999.
   Adventists have not escaped the violence against Christians in
India. During a lay training program in Madras, a young man named
Samson related his story.
    Samson comes from a village in central India. During evangelistic
meetings he and his family learned about the Bible Sabbath and
decided to follow the clear teaching of God's Word.
    The Christian community grew until one in every three villagers
was a Christian. The non-Christians began to feel threatened. Who
would control community politics?
    Then one day concern boiled over into violence. Christians had to
flee for their lives. Their livestock was stolen, and their homes were
looted and set afire. Fifteen young Christians who tried to resist their
attackers were hacked to death. Their bodies were piled up in the
village square, dowsed with gasoline, and set ablaze. Samson's church
lost one member in the massacre.
    The government arrested 54 persons, but the non-Christian major-
ity had so many friends in high positions that soon all of those who had
been arrested were released on bail. For nine months the Christians
who fled the village lived as refugees in a distant village.
    Samson and other Christians have since returned to their village.
They are attempting to start over, but it takes time to build a home,
build up new flocks and herds, and establish a new farming routine.
The Christians pray that they can form new relationships among the
many religious communities in the village. But that is difficult when
they have watched some of their numbers die.
    In spite of the terrorism, the Adventist church has continued to
grow. It now has more than 110 members, with another 80 members in
nearby villages.
    It is so easy to become news-hardened. The pictures of tears, death,
and suffering barely interrupt our busy schedules. May we do our best
to reach out in love and prayer on behalf of those who suffer for
 Christ's sake.

                Apples of Gold




Sabbath Afternoon
THE CAPACITY TO LISTEN IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE CAPAC-
ITY TO SPEAK. A young man asked Socrates to teach him oratory.
Because he talked so much, Socrates asked for double fees. "Why are
you charging me double?" the young student asked. "Because I must
teach you two sciences: the one, how to hold your tongue, and the
other, how to speak. The first science is the more difficult, but aim for
proficiency at it, or you will suffer greatly and create trouble without
end."
   What goes on in our minds determines the effectiveness or ineffec-
tiveness of our speech. " Tor out of the overflow of the heart the
mouth speaks' " (Matt. 12:34, NIV). "The heart" refers to the mind,
the source of thoughts, feelings, actions, and motives. Even as posi-
tive and negative actions stem from the mind, so do positive and
negative words. The things we say have important consequences not
only to the people around us, but to our own souls, as well. As you
study this week's lesson, remember that our words are either a source
of strength and encouragement or of weakness and despair. They
either build up or tear down. As we allow the power of God's Word to
control our minds, our words will reflect His love.

THE POWER OF THE TONGUE (Prov. 15:4).

   Describe the type of power the tongue exercises. Prov. 15:4; James
3:2-12.

    Jesus illustrated the importance of mind-control as the basis of
speech-control in Matthew 12:34-37. The tongue is an index to the
heart. The reason for the abundance of "mouth trouble" that afflicts us
is the "heart trouble" with which we were born and to which we have
added by our wrong choices.
    Jesus said that idle words are sin. In the judgment, we are justified or
condemned by our words. This does not mean that we earn justification
by good words. It means that consistently good words are evidence of
the heart change we have experienced, and evil words are proof that
change needs to be made.
    The only permanent remedy lies in the power of the Master Teacher,
who can transform our minds and enable us to speak pure words. One
way Jesus does this is through the medium of Christian education and
Christian teachers. "In the highest sense, the work of education and
the work of redemption are one."—Education, p. 30.

   How would you express Proverbs 4:23 in your own words?

   How can you follow this counsel? Notice the context of Proverbs
4:23. We must cherish God's Word (vs. 20, 21). The question arises,
How? "I can do everything through him who gives me strength" (Phil.
4:13, NIV). We choose Christ daily, feeding on His Word, storing in our
minds the positive truths and promises it contains. When we are tempted
to give voice to evil words, we ask Christ for His power, claim His
victory, and praise Him for it. By reminding ourselves of His Word and
claiming it by faith, we can speak in a manner acceptable to Heaven.
   "In the work of heart-keeping we must be instant in prayer, un-
wearied in petitioning the throne of grace for assistance. Those who
take the name of Christian should come to God in earnestness and
humility, pleading for help. . . .
   "He whose conversation is in heaven, is the most profitable Chris-
tian to all around him. His words are useful and refreshing. They have a
transforming power upon those who hear them, and will melt and
subdue the soul."—Ellen G. White Comments, The SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 3, p. 1157.

    We have emphasized that what is on the inside comes through
 to the outside. Is it also true that our words influence our own
 minds? Explain.

WORDS THAT DESTROY, PART 1 (Pros. 10:19).

   Destructive words come in a number of forms: lies, criticism, gossip,
flattery, impulsiveness, scorn, argumentativeness, and anger. All such
negative speech comes from minds that are out of harmony with Christ.

   Identify the types of lying mentioned in the following passages.
What will ultimately become of liars? Refer to a modern version if
possible.

     Prov. 14:5, 25

     Prov. 18:8

     Prov. 19:5, 9

     Prov. 20:14

     Prov. 26:18,19

   " Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.' False speak-
ing in any matter, every attempt or purpose to deceive our neighbor, is here
included. An intention to deceive is what constitutes falsehood. By a
glance of the eye, a motion of the hand, an expression of the countenance,
a falsehood may be told as effectually as by words. All intentional over-
statement, every hint or insinuation calculated to convey erroneous or
exaggerated impression, even the statement of facts in such a manner as to
mislead, is falsehood. . . . Even the intentional suppression of truth, by
which injury may result to others, is a violation of the ninth command-
ment."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 309.

  What does the book of Proverbs have to say about strife and gossip?

of those who are endeavoring to bear responsibilities in the

WORDS THAT DESTROY, PART 2 (Prov. 26:28).

   Why is flattery so harmful? Prov. 26:28; 27:6; 28:23; 29:5.


   Flattery is insincere or excessive praise. A genuine expression of
appreciation is not flattery. In the attempt to avoid flattery, we some-
times hurt people by giving them little or no praise. The ministry of
encouragement can revitalize the waning forces of a weary soul.

   Why is hasty speech so damaging? Prov. 29:20.


  What are the advantages of restraint and caution in the way we
express ourselves? Prov. 15:1, 28; 18:13.


   "Be sure brain is engaged before putting mouth into gear." This is
practical advice that can be applied, especially when the brain itself is in
contact with Headquarters!
   "The servants of Christ ... need to have close communion with God,
lest, under provocation, self rise up, and they pour forth a torrent of
words that are unbefitting, that are not as dew or the still showers that
refresh the withering plants. This is what Satan wants them to do; for
these are his methods. . . . But God's servants are to be representatives
of Him. . . . And the spirit that is kept gentle under provocation will
speak more effectively in favor of the truth than will any argument,
however forcible."—The Desire of Ages, p. 353.

   What do the following passages teach regarding scorn and anger?

   Prov. 15:18

   Prov. 16:32

   Prov. 22:10


    How delightfully practical the Bible is! It identifies the types of
 speech that cause sorrow, hostility, and misery: lying, criticism,
 gossip, flattery, and hasty, scornful, angry words. Assuming that at
 least sometimes you are guilty of one or more of these types of
 speech, what steps do you take to overcome? What counsel from
 your personal experience would you share with someone struggling
 with the habit of speaking unwisely?

WORDS THAT INSPIRE (Prov. 10:11).

   One way to describe something is to tell what it is not. This is not the
only way the writers of the proverbs give instruction regarding proper
speech. They tell us what good speech is and the effect it has.

   How does the book of Proverbs characterize the speech of a
righteous person?

     Prov. 10:11

     Prov. 10:13, 31

     Prov. 10:21

     Prov. 10:32


   The manner in which Jesus spoke is the best example of the effec-
tiveness of righteous words. Even the hardened hearts of the temple
guards melted, for they testified, "No one ever spoke the way this man
does" (John 7:46, NIV). The reaction of the two disciples who walked
with Him to Emmaus was the reaction of people throughout His life and
ministry: "Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by
the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?" (Luke 24:32).
   Jesus' words were wise, uplifting, encouraging, knowledgeable, and
cautious. Even when He issued a rebuke, He did so in a spirit of love,
with the intention of saving the offending person. He understood the
force of simple eloquence and the power of silence. (See The Desire of
Ages, p. 353.)

  What is one of the most effective ways to lift another's burdens?
Prov. 12:25; 15:23, 30; 16:24; 17:22.


   Positive, encouraging words inspire both the listener and the speaker.
Anger, discontent, selfishness, and impurity are ruinous in effect, while
there is marvelous life-giving power in cheerfulness, courage, faith,
hope, and love. Before speaking, we should always ponder what effect
our words will have on the listener.

   Based on the experiences you have had with encouraging and
discouraging words, how would you complete the following?

`It is written' was the way the Master met Satan's subtle allurements (see
Matt. 4:4, 7, 10). . . . The mind must constantly feed upon the Word, else
the defenses of soul will break down, and Satan will gain the advantage.

    "The world is indeed full of hurry, and of pride, selfishness, avarice,
and violence; and it may seem to us that it is a waste of time and breath
to be ever in season and out of season, and on all occasions to hold
ourselves in readiness to speak words that are gentle, pure, elevating,
chaste, and holy, in the face of the whirlwind of confusion, bustle, and
strife. And yet words fitly spoken, coming from sanctified hearts and
lips, and sustained by a godly, consistent Christian deportment, will be
as apples of gold in pictures of silver."—Testimonies for the Church,
vol. 3, p. 247.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. This week we studied how Proverbs illustrates the power of
     words. Based on the culture in which you live and the
     experiences you have had, how would you illustrate this
     power?

     2. Are we being judgmental when we evaluate a person's charac-
        ter or motives by her or his words? Explain your answer.

     3. Based on this week's study, is "roasting" a person or joking
        around about someone an appropriate Christian activity? Ex-
        plain.

     4. Explain the difference between negative criticism and positive
        criticism. Should a Christian ever deliver negative criticism?
        Explain. How should we offer positive criticism?

     5. In what instances might silence be better than any type of
        words?

SUMMARIZE this week's lesson by writing a brief statement that
reviews each of the following sections of this week's lesson: The Power
of the Tongue (Prov. 15:4); Words That Destroy (Prov. 10:19; 26:28);
Words That Inspire (Prov. 10:11); God's Words (Prov. 30:5).

                     Daddy, Jesus Loves You
                            Charlotte Ishkanian

    Six-year-old Isis [EE-sees] opened the door of her home and walked
toward her bedroom. As she passed her parents' bedroom, she saw her
father sitting on the bed. Isis tiptoed in and gave him a big hug. She
flashed a smile and said, "Daddy, I love you! And Jesus loves you,
too!" Then she turned and ran from the room, leaving her father alone.
    Isis's parents were not Adventists, but they sent their daughter to
the Adventist school. There she was learning about God's love.
    Isis's father worked hard to provide his family with the best things in
life. But the more they had, the more he wanted, and soon he had trouble
paying his bills. He borrowed money to pay his bills, but when he could
not repay the loan one month the lender threatened to take his house.
    Worried, he borrowed money from another man to pay the lender.
But soon he could not pay the second loan. He felt trapped and faced
losing everything he had worked for.
    Father saw only one way out of his problem. His life insurance
policy would provide enough to pay his bills and leave his family to
live on for several years. But the only way they could collect that
money was if he died. Desperate, Isis's father decided to end his life.
He bought a gun and hid it. Then he sat down on the bed to think.
    But when Isis hugged him, he realized that no matter what hap-
pened, he could not do anything to hurt them! He went to find Isis.
"Honey," he said, "what did you just say about Jesus?"
    "Every day my teacher tells us that Jesus loves us," she answered.
"Come to school with me tomorrow; my teacher will tell you."
    Daddy did not wait until the next day. He went to find his daughter's
teacher that afternoon. The teacher was not at school, but the principal
 and the pastor were. As they talked with him, he realized that without
 God in his life, no amount of money could bring him happiness. The
 pastor offered to study the Bible with him and show him how to find
                              God. That week the whole family began
                              attending the Adventist church.
                                  Isis's father lost his job, and he had to sell
                              their house. But he says that God used his
                              little girl to help him see what is really im-
                              portant in life. Today the entire family are
                              happy Seventh-day Adventist Christians.

                                  Isis and her father (left). The family lives
                               in Salvador, Brazil. Charlotte Ishkanian is

             "What Hath God
               Wrought!"




Sabbath Afternoon
GOD IS THE AUTHOR OF REVELATION AND OF ALL TRUE
SCIENCE. A study of either sheds light on the other and ultimately
advances our knowledge of the Creator Himself.
   "In their original perfection all created things were an expression of
the thought of God. To Adam and Eve in their Eden home nature was
full of the knowledge of God, teeming with divine instruction. Wisdom
spoke to the eye and was received into the heart; for they communed
with God in His created works. As soon as the holy pair transgressed
the law of the Most High, the brightness from the face of God departed
from the face of nature. The earth is now marred and defiled by sin. Yet
even in its blighted state much that is beautiful remains. God's object
lessons are not obliterated; rightly understood, nature speaks of her
Creator."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 18.

LESSONS FROM LIFE SCIENCE, PART 1 (Prov. 6:6-11).

   By connecting truth with familiar objects, we recall afresh, with
every sight of those objects, the teaching of Scripture and the impres-
sions of the Holy Spirit. This, incidentally, is one practical method of
keeping our hearts "in tune" with heaven.

  Of whom does Job advise us to inquire for information concerning
God? Job 12:7-9.


   We can learn so much from animals. Learning about them gives us a
clearer picture of God's care for His creatures. How can a bear hibernate
five months without losing its ability to use its muscles in the spring?
How can young songbirds migrate hundreds of miles to wintering
areas they have never seen, after the parent birds have gone ahead?
How can lizards regenerate a tail after having dropped the original? Or
how can a starfish not only grow a new arm to replace one lost from
the original body but generate a new body on a severed arm if that arm
includes a nerve from the main trunk?
   Research in nature can also benefit humankind. Scientists studying
the social behavior of wolves learn how they settle their differences
short of bloodshed, thereby hoping to learn how to diffuse human
anger and avoid national and world crises.

   What parables of Jesus does Job 12:79 bring to mind? What do
these parables teach? The following chart will get you started. What
would you add to this chart?

LESSONS FROM LIFE SCIENCE, PART 2 (Prov. 30:25, 27-31).

     List the characteristics of the coney. Prov. 30:24, 26.


   What can we learn from the coney? "There is general agreement now
that the animal intended must have been the hyrax."—The Bible
Almanac (Nashville: Thomas Nelson, 1980). The hyrax is a furry
creature about the size of the hare. Its remarkable features include its
feet and toes, four toes on its front feet and three on its hind feet. Skin
folds connect the toes, and pads kept moist by glands equip the feet.
The feet thus form natural suction cups, which enable the coney to
climb the steepest and most slippery rocks.
   Colonies of coneys live in mountainous areas. They still reside in the
rocky Dead Sea area of Palestine. They post guards who, when danger
approaches, sound an alarm by issuing sharp whistles. Then all scurry
for cover in the crannies of the rocks. (Based on Encyclopedia of Bible
Creatures [Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1965], pp. 63,64. See Ps. 104:18.)
Just as the rocks protect the coneys, so Christ, the solid Rock, protects
Christians against ultimate harm. "He who is imbued with the spirit of
Christ abides in Christ. The blow that is aimed at him falls upon the
Saviour, who surrounds him with His presence. . . . Nothing can touch
him except by our Lord's permission."—Thoughts From The Mount
of Blessing, p. 71.

   What other animals impressed the writer of Proverbs 30? What did
he particularly like about each one? Vs. 25, 27-31.

lessons can you learn from it?

LESSONS FROM LIFE SCIENCE, PART 3 (Matt. 6:25-34).

   Yesterday's lesson ended with a discussion of the lessons we can
learn from the ant. Today's lesson carries on with this topic.
   "The habitations which the ants build for themselves show skill and
perseverance. Only one little grain at a time can they handle, but by
diligence and perseverance they accomplish wonders. Solomon pre-
sents to the world the industry of the ant as a reproach to those who
waste their hours in sinful idleness, in practices which corrupt soul and
body. The ant prepares for future seasons. This is a lesson which many
gifted with reasoning powers disregard. They fail entirely to prepare for
the future immortal life which God has in His providence secured for the
fallen race."—Ellen G. White Comments, The SDA Bible Commen-
tary, vol. 3, pp. 1157, 1158.

   What seemingly opposite lesson does Jesus present in His Sermon
on the Mount? Matt. 6:25, 26. Taken together, what do Proverbs 6:
6-11 and Matthew 6:25, 26 tell us about God's expectations in the matter
of meeting our needs?

   "Relax! Eat, drink, and be merry, for God will provide!" Not so!
The desired response is trust, not irresponsibility or extravagance. The
Father in heaven provides for the birds, but He does not drop food into
their mouths or build their nests for them. They must gather food, build
nests, and raise their young. The possibility of destruction by enemy
forces is very real on every side. Yet, how full of joy their songs are!
These creatures of hill, wood, and field are part of God's great house-
hold, and it is from His hand that the desire of each is satisfied. (See Ps.
145:16.)
   In Matthew 6:28-34, Jesus continues to illustrate from nature His
teaching regarding trust. Why else would God have "clothed the grass"
in such a magnificent array of flowers, from brilliant jewel tones and
delicate pastels to glistening, almost iridescent white—and all fash-
ioned in exquisite, intricate detail—unless He did it for sheer enjoy-
ment? For God is the Master Artist, a lover of beauty. Within His
children, He has planted a like appreciation and has even given us a
power akin to His own—individuality, creativity, inventiveness, ap-
portioned in varying degrees. Because He is able to clothe nature and
human personality with such beauty, why should we doubt His will-
ingness to supply our daily needs?

   Are you so involved in the affairs of your busy life that you do
 not take time to enjoy nature? What other lessons from nature
 have you found helpful?

                                                                         75
Wednesday                                           November 29
LESSONS FROM PHYSICAL SCIENCE (Prov. 3:19, 20; Ps.
19:1-6).

     How are God's wisdom and power manifested? Prov. 3:19, 20.


   Verse 19 speaks of the creation of the heavens and the earth.
Verse 20 indicates how God maintains His marvelous creation. He
acted in the beginning. He continues to act day by day, moment by
moment. Every day and night, God is at work in the natural world.
He keeps the earth spinning on its axis, rotating in its orbit around
the sun, not only keeping time but governing time, days, seasons,
and years.
   Despite its great weight, water is drawn up from the seas into the
clouds and drips again as dew or rain to dress the earth in green
vegetation. The grand cycle is constantly repeated. In His control over
the processes of nature, God employs engineering marvels far beyond
the ingenuity and power of any one person.

     According to Psalm 19:1-6, what do the heavens declare about God?


    The vastness, beauty, and clockwork order of the starry heavens
reveal something of the character of God. His power is infinite. He is the
author of matchless beauty, and He insists upon order and design. It takes
at least as much faith to believe that galaxies of stars evolved on their
own as it does to believe the Bible account that God created them.

   Study Psalm 19:1-4 by focusing on the italicized words or phrases
as they appear below. What do they tell us about how nature
teaches us about God? (For example, the heavens do not just
whisper about God, they declare, thus implying that they "shout it
from the roof-tops.") Also, how do these words make you feel
about God's creation?

                   The heavens declare the glory of God;
                      The skies proclaim the work of his hands.
             Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night
                      they display knowledge. . . .
             Their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the
                      ends of the world.

    Unbelievers can see a bit of God's character in the universe
 and in the lives of Christians. By what attitudes, words, and
 actions do you make Christ known to others?

GOD'S CREATIVE MASTERPIECE (Ps. 8:3-6; Prov. 8:22-31).

  While observing the brilliance of the night sky, what important
question did David ask the Lord? Ps. 8:3-6.


    As the following story suggests, we seem to be infinitesimal specks
on a tiny world in one small solar system of infinite space. A Jewish
rabbi once offered a possible explanation for the wearing of the yar-
mulka, the little cap worn at Passover. He said, "The yarmulka is like
the palm of the hand of God resting in blessing on the man in the home
saying, 'Little man, you're not such big stuff!' "—Ronald B. Allen, The
Majesty of Man (Portland, Ore.: Multnomah Press, 1984), p. 70.
    Yet, we must not forget that in Psalm 139:14 David rejoices that he
is "wonderfully made" (NIV). Indeed, the creation of humankind is
the most wonderful of all God's creative work, and the design and
function of every system of the human body are wonders of supernatu-
ral wisdom and power. The human body is composed of 75-100
trillion cells. Several billion wear out and are replaced every day. The
heart pumps about three gallons of blood per minute, millions of
gallons in an average lifetime. The wonder of human physiology leads
us to exclaim, "What hath God wrought!" (Num. 23:23).

  What clue does Proverbs 8:22-31 give regarding the Creator's
purpose and motivation?


   Wisdom is the subject of this chapter (v. 12). We discovered in an earlier
lesson that the wisdom of Proverbs is the wisdom of God. In the central
passage of this chapter, the author tells of God's wisdom in creating the
world. In the New Testament, we learn that Christ is "the wisdom of God"
(1 Cor. 1:24), and five texts declare that He created the world (John 1:1-3,
10; 1 Cor. 8:6; Eph. 3:9; Col. 1:16, 17; Heb. 1:1-3). Proverbs 3:19 teaches
that "the Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth." Commenting on
Proverbs 8:22, Ellen White writes: "The Son of God declares concerning
Himself: 'The Lord possessed me in the beginning.'"—Patriarchs and
Prophets, p. 34. Hence, wisdom is Christ the Creator.

     Read the Creation story in Genesis 1:1-27. Then take time to
 envision Adam and Eve hearing about how God created humans
 and the world. Feel as they must have felt when God told them
 how He had formed Adam out of the earth and Eve from one of
 his ribs. Marvel as they did when God explained how He deco-
 rated the earth with all the plants and animals and the sky with
 its various lights. Worship God for all His splendor and glory.

                                                                          77
Friday                                                 December 1
FURTHER STUDY: What do the following verses teach us about
our relationship to God's creation: Genesis 1:26; 2:15; and Revelation
11:18?

   "God's command that humanity exercise dominion over and subdue
the earth does not constitute license to exploit the environment. . . . He
created the earth, and maintains it so that it does not degenerate to
chaos. And those God placed on earth to rule 'in his own image' are to
imitate God as rulers and creators.
   "Humanity, then, are to maintain the creation. They are, so to speak,
co-creators--stewards of the earth. God cannot sanction our harmful
exploitation of it. This would indicate alienation from His creation. . . .
Approving humanity's destruction of the creation would imply divine
mindlessness to humanity's self-destruction. . . .
   "Emphasis on human health is fundamentally illogical without an
equal concern for the well-being of the environment. Air and water
pollution is as much a threat to human health as are those poisons we
have the liberty not to take into our bodies."—A. Josef Greig, "Adventists
and the Environment," Adventist Review (April 19, 1990), pp. 16, 18.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Think of some small ways you can enjoy nature despite your
     hectic schedule. What can you do if you live in a large city
     where there is little of nature to enjoy?

     2. Nature is often fierce and devastating, as is the case when
        tornadoes, hurricanes, etc. strike. Insurance companies claim
        such occurrences as "acts of God." Is this really the case?
        Explain.

     3. Without forgetting our main purpose of spreading the gospel,
        what can we as Seventh-day Adventists do to show our respect
        for God's creation?

SUMMARIZE this week's lesson by answering this question: How
does the natural world, the physical universe, and the physical struc-
ture of humankind direct us to Jesus Christ, the Wisdom of God?
   As you continue to contemplate God's reflection in nature, remem-
ber that He seeks to restore us to the perfect image of Himself so that we
can have unending joy in the sin-free universe.

 111b,
                 Making Friends for Christ
                            J. H. Zachary

   Tanya is the 26-year-old wife of a Russian pastor living in
Archangelsk, a major city in northern Siberia. While Tanya enjoys
her Christian friends, she eagerly seeks out friendships with non-
Adventist women. And in the past few years she has won 10 of her
friends to Christ.
    Recently she received a telephone call from a friend who lives
in the city where Tanya and her husband served before moving to
Archangelsk. Her friend called to thank her for sharing the joy of
knowing Jesus and to tell her that she had just been baptized.
    As Tanya shared this good news with others, she added, "I
praise the Lord that 10 of my friends are now friends with Jesus
also." When asked how she finds her new friends and wins so
many to Christ, Tanya answered, "They are my neighbors. I just
enjoy visiting them and sharing my life with them. I do not preach,
but as we become acquainted they ask me what it is that makes me
so happy."
    Tanya gave an example of her friendship ministry. Recently she
was preparing a meal for some visiting church leaders and asked
Natali, her neighbor, to help her. As the two women worked
together preparing the meal, Natali began asking Tanya questions.
"Who are these people from Moscow and Washington D.C. who
have come to our city? Why are they here?" Tanya used this
opportunity to tell Natali about her church and its mission. The
foods she chose to prepare for the guests and the absence of liquor
led to a discussion of biblical health principles.
    As the women's friendship grew and Natali saw more of Tanya's
way of life, she was impressed by the peace and joy this family
enjoyed.
    Sometime later Tanya learned that Natali had convinced her
husband to stop smoking and drinking. Without realizing it, Natali
and her family already are beginning to experience the positive
results of the Adventist lifestyle.
    Tanya says, "The Lord is working. It won't be long before an
opportunity will come to discuss our beliefs." This time Tanya
 may win more than one friend for Christ; she may win her friend's
 husband, too.

        Like Father, Like Son




Sabbath Afternoon
ANGER CAN MAKE US THOROUGHLY IRRATIONAL. On
one occasion, an important businessman entered the dining car of the
train in which he was traveling and ordered plum pudding. The waiter
explained that they had no plum pudding. The businessman became
angry. He roared at the waiter: "Don't you realize that you're talking
to one of the most frequent customers of this railroad?"
    The steward got off at the next stop and managed to get him some
plum pudding. The passenger looked at it disdainfully and snorted,
"Take it away! I'd rather be mad at the railroad."
    God's anger is quite different. Never is He irrational. Never does He
react in an unloving manner, and never are His attitudes toward us
governed by selfishness. God's wrath against sin is another aspect of
His love. If He did not hate sin and deal with the sinner, we would have
reason to question the genuineness of His love.
    Whereas anger, revenge, and strife destroy physical health and
spiritual vitality, a positive, contented, optimistic attitude of mind con-
tributes to health and spirituality. Is there any place for anger? What
does the Bible mean when it speaks of God's anger? The lesson this
week will answer these questions.

HAPPY, HEALTHY, HOLY (Prov. 17:22).

   Happiness has been a major quest of humankind from time immemo-
rial. Unfortunately, most people have ruled out fellowship with God as
the source of genuine happiness. The book of Proverbs brings us back
to that Source.

  Happiness results in what well-organized benefit? Prov. 17:22;
18:14; 12:25; 15:15.


   The Hebrew word translated "merry" in the King James version
means "joyful," "glad." The type of merriment intended is not boister-
ous hilarity but a sense of peace and freedom from guilt and fear. It is
also contentment with the circumstances of life. Such contentment is
determined more by the state of a person's heart than by the value of
his or her possessions. It is as Jesus taught: " 'Life is more than food,
and the body more than clothes"' (Luke 12:23, NIV).
   "The pessimist worries so much about the past, which he cannot
alter, and the future, which he cannot know, that he does not use wisely
the present, which alone is his. This attitude of gloom colors his vision
and reacts upon others. The glad, contented heart finds a feast in a little
thankfully received, forgets the troubles that are behind, and looks
forward with joy and confidence to a future under the loving care of a
heavenly Father."— The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1000.
    Four hundred years ago, Robert Burton, in his Anatomy of Melan-
choly, cited authorities who said, "Humor purges the blood, making the
body lively and fit for any manner of employment." The philosopher
Immanuel Kant believed a hearty laugh to be "a good way to jog
internally without going outdoors."
    On the other hand, research of grieving persons has revealed a
decrease in the number of white blood cells, the "soldiers" that combat
germs. Grief weakens the body's defenses that fight disease. Signifi-
cantly, it is bone marrow that manufactures blood cells.

   Who is it that finds true happiness? Matt. 5:3-12.


    How could you be filled with contentment, peace, and joy
 under the following circumstances? (1) You have been laid off
 work and cannot find another job. (2) Your boss, who is not
 sympathetic with your religious faith, enjoys making fun of you
 in front of others. (3) Your daughter, who is about to be mar-
 ried, has been involved in a car accident. (4) You have just
 discovered your son or daughter has AIDS.

                                                                        81

ANGER, STRIFE, AND REVENGE, PART 1 (Prov. 16:32).

     What causes of strife do the following verses point out?

     Prov. 13:10

     Prov. 17:19

     Prov. 22:10

     Prov. 26:20

     Prov. 30:33


    The Lord does not hate in the human sense, in a spirit of selfish
vindictiveness, but because sin is completely alien to His nature, He is
totally antagonistic to it. This is why the Bible teaches that God hates
lies and discord. (See Prov. 6:16, 19.) There is no disharmony in heaven,
and the Lord seeks to bring human beings into peaceful fellowship with
Himself and with one another. "When the ways of people please the
Lord, he causes even their enemies to be at peace with them" (Prov.
16:7, NRSV). Jesus taught the danger of anger (Matt. 5:21-24) and
instructed us to love our enemies (v. 44).

  What descriptive words does Solomon apply to the individual who
quickly becomes angry? Prov. 14:17, 29; 19:19.


   When we lose our temper, we are actually not in control of our
reason. We are reacting rather than acting. Having temporarily lost our
mind and thrown out the life principles we had so carefully chosen, we
say and do things we later regret. We become fools.
   Bad temper can become a habit. Today's English Version translates
Proverbs 19:19: "If someone has a hot temper, let him take the conse-
quences. If you get him out of trouble once, you will have to do it
again." Bad temper is a return to immature ways of reacting. Certain
stimuli suggest a negative mode of behavior that has become custom-
ary. The only escape from this vicious circle is to allow God to take
control of the mind and heart. For "God will be to us everything we
will let Him be."—Our High Calling, p. 131.

   Habit is an important factor in life. Why do we need habits as
the basis for living?

ANGER, STRIFE, AND REVENGE, PART 2 (Prov. 20:22;
24:29).

   When two people are consistently hurting one another, how can
they break the cycle of action and reaction? Prov. 20:22; 24:29.


    As long as both parties operate on the basis of the principle that
"one bad turn deserves another," they will continue the fight. This is
the stuff of which family feuds are made, with human life being de-
stroyed figuratively, as well as literally. If only someone would be big
enough to forgive! It matters not so much who started the quarrel as
who ends it peaceably.
    Those who are slow to anger and control their tempers have achieved a
great victory. They are "better than the mighty" or one "who captures a
city" (Prov. 16:32, NRSV). But controlling negative emotions, forgiving
a person who has wronged us, and overcoming bitterness are a first
choice. Forgiveness is not feeling forgiving; neither is it saying that a
wrong is right. Forgiveness is giving to God one's right to revenge. Then
"wait for the Lord, and He will deliver you" (Prov. 20:22, NIV).
    "It is true there is an indignation that is justifiable, even in the
followers of Christ. When they see that God is dishonored, and His
service brought into disrepute, when they see the innocent oppressed,
a righteous indignation stirs the soul. Such anger, born of sensitive
morals, is not a sin. But those who at any supposed provocation feel at
liberty to indulge anger and resentment are opening the heart to Satan.
Bitterness and animosity must be banished from the soul if we would be
 in harmony with heaven."—The Desire of Ages, p. 310. (See Eph. 4:26.)

  What principle does Romans 14:13 give us upon which we can base
our relationship with others?


   Are there stumbling blocks in your path? Even they do not consti-
tute a legitimate excuse for bad temper, for God knows how to deal with
them.
   "If we are creatures of circumstance, we shall surely fail of perfecting
Christian characters. You must master circumstances, and not allow
circumstances to master you. You can find energy at the cross of
Christ."—Testimoniesfor the Church, vol. 3, p. 47.

   In your own experience, what good methods have you employed
 in counteracting the causes of strife and discord?

   How would you recommend that someone else use these methods?

                                                                        83

THE WRATH OF THE ALMIGHTY, PART 1 (Prov. 11:23).

   "If I'm not supposed to get mad, why can God?" This kind of
question draws more than one kind of response. A typical but shallow
and inaccurate answer would be: "Well, God is ruler and master of
everything, so He has the right to do whatever He wants. You don't
question Him."
    At the other extreme is "What do you mean? God can get mad?
Why, that is contrary to His nature! He would never hurt anything!"
    Both answers present problems. The first pictures our loving Father-
God as a wise, powerful, but severe and arbitrary dictator who has
neither time for nor interest in our questions and who cares for nothing
from His subjects but immediate and absolute compliance. The oppo-
site view sees the all-powerful Creator as an indulgent parent who
cannot bear to bring an evildoer to justice but who lets things run their
natural course rather than interpose. Such incomplete pictures of God
fail to portray the truth about Him.

  What can people expect when they do not experience righteous-
ness? Prov. 11:5, 23.


   The consistent teaching of Scripture is that only the righteous will
enjoy eternal life with Christ. (See Matt. 25:46; Heb. 12:14.) The sinner
who refuses to accept Christ's power to stop sinning and the gift of His
righteousness has no hope beyond the grave. (See Rev. 20:9, 15.)

  When Moses insisted on a revelation of God's glory, what did he see,
and what did he hear? Exod. 34:5-7.

     What he saw

     What two aspects of God's love do we notice in Exodus 34:7?

  Think about your life and how at times you may have disap-
pointed God. Aren't you glad He is slow to anger?
  How can you praise Him for His abundant mercy and grace?

GOD'S MORAL RESPONSE TO SIN (John 3:16-21).

   At the end of yesterday's lesson, we studied the picture of God that
appears in Exodus 34:5-7. From this description, we can know that the
Old Testament does not portray God as a harsh God whom we must
indulge. Think of other places in the Old Testament that portray God
according to the picture in Exodus 34:5-7.

   How does this depiction of God's character harmonize with the
severity of His judgments described in the following passages?


   Gen. 6:5-7,11-13

   Gen. 18:32; 19:24, 25

   Exod. 11:4-7


   Did God cause this destruction? Explain your answer.


   "God is Himself the source of all mercy.... He does not ask if we are
worthy of His love, but He pours upon us the riches of His love to make
us worthy. He is not vindictive. He seeks not to punish, but to redeem.
Even the severity which He manifests through His providences is
manifested for the salvation of the wayward. .. . It is true that God 'will
by no means clear the guilty' (Exodus 34:7), but He would take away
the guilt."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 22.
   In both His teachings and His life, Jesus demonstrated what God is
like (John 14:9). The God of the Sermon on the Mount and the God who
destroyed the world by the Flood are one and the same. (See 2 Pet. 3:5,
6; Heb. 13:8.) While God expresses Himself most fully in the life of
Christ, the tragic existence of sin requires His intervention.
   Extreme situations sometimes require major "surgery," as in the
cases of both the antediluvian world and the city of Sodom. Civilization
in general had become so vile as to be a moral menace to humanity.
Because God is perfect in character, perfect in wisdom, in love, in
righteousness, and in justice, He can not do other than deal in perfect
fairness with evil and with sinners who persist in it (Heb. 10:30).
Calvary fully demonstrated this fairness. Read John 3:16-21.

   Realizing that the eternal Judge is my friend, who is on my side,
 what keeps me from enjoying a closer relationship with Him?


                                                                        85

FURTHER STUDY: What do the following stories teach us about
anger, strife, and contentment: Genesis 37? Deuteronomy 11?
   To learn more about what constitutes true happiness, read "The
Sermon on the Mount," in The Desire of Ages, pp. 298-314.

   "The presence of Christ alone can make men and women happy. All
the common waters of life Christ can turn into the wine of heaven. The
home then becomes as an Eden of bliss; the family, a beautiful symbol
of the family in heaven."—The Adventist Home, p. 28.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How can we help people accept holiness as the basis of genuine
     happiness?

     2. A contented person is not a bad-tempered person. What basis
        does contentment have in a spiritual life?

     3. What relationship exists between music and human tempera-
        ment and behavior? (Consider Exod. 15; 32:18, 19; 2 Chron.
        20:21-24; Dan. 3:4, 5; Judg. 5:3.) How can music help us to
        be happy or cope with a problem?

     4. Why should we allow God to take from us all of our bitterness
        and anger?

     5. Does being content mean that we should not strive to better our
        condition or improve ourselves in any way? Explain your an-
        swer.

SUMMARIZE this week's lesson by answering the following ques-
tions: Is there any place for anger? Explain your answer. What does the
Bible mean when it speaks of God's anger?
   Happiness and contentment are treasures of superlative value. The
peace that Christ imparts is far superior to any so-called happiness
the world has to offer. Nothing need disturb that peace, for it is not
dependent on outward circumstances. Even though others may try to
make life miserable for us, though anger and strife rage around us, we
can be kept in the peace of heaven, for nothing can disturb us when
Jesus dwells within. Then, as children of God, we shall be like our
Father.

                         By Her Fruits
                        Charlotte Ishkanian

   Celestine is a teenager from the country of Chad in the heart of
Africa. Her family worshiped traditional gods—trees, stones, and
plants. They had no knowledge of Jesus Christ until Celestine's elder
brother visited an Adventist church with a friend. Celestine asked her
brother if she could go with him to the church, and he agreed. She
enjoyed the youth group and the activities they planned. They held
Bible study meetings, played sports together, and shared their faith 1
with others.
   Celestine's parents noticed a difference in their children's behavior
and asked what had changed them. When Celestine told them that it
was God's Word that made a difference, her parents decided to visit
the church to see what could cause such a big difference. A year later
her parents were baptized.
   When Celestine entered secondary school she faced the problem of
Sabbath classes. She decided that she would not attend classes on
Sabbath, and although most of her teachers excused these absences,
the decision caused some problems. Then as the end of her tenth grade
year approached, she prepared to take the special exams students must
pass in order to receive their diploma.
   When the exam schedule was posted, she saw that exams were
scheduled on Thursday through Saturday. Celestine decided that she
would not take the exams on Sabbath, even though it meant that she
might have to repeat the entire school year. She would take the exams
on Thursday and Friday, but on Sabbath she would be in church.
   Some of her friends laughed and called her a fool when she told
them she would not take the exams on Sabbath.
   Then, during the exams the headmaster announced that all sections
of the exams would be completed by Friday afternoon, and there were
no exams on Saturday. Celestine praised God for answering her
prayers. But then she faced another problem. Some of her friends
                          began to say that she must be a witch to have
                          the power to cancel the Saturday exams!
                          Celestine told them that the only power she
                          had was the power of prayer.
                              Celestine wants to do what is pleasing to
                          God, and rejoiced when God allowed her to
                          complete her exams to His glory.

     A Friend for All Seasons




Sabbath Afternoon

THERE IS MORE THAN ONE TYPE OF FRIEND. When the
editors of a magazine offered a prize for the best definition of a friend,
they received thousands of responses. One person wrote: "A friend is one
who multiplies joys and divides grief." Another suggested: "A friend is
one who understands our silence." Yet another said: "A friend is a
volume of sympathy bound in cloth." The definition that won the prize
read: "A friend—the one who comes in when the whole world goes out."
    A true friend is a treasure whose worth is beyond compare. A false
friend, or one whose life is directed by a different value system, could
constitute a major danger. God has given us insight and warning to
guide us in the choice of our friends.
    We need to develop our social awareness, so we might reach out in
friendship to people where they are and minister to their needs. Reach-
ing out to others is a privilege and a responsibility, as well as a spiritual
gift. This week as you study, you will learn that the theology of
friendship includes (1) companionship among loved ones who share
similar values and convictions, (2) hospitality that brings others to
Christ, and (3) kindness to strangers.

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE:
  I. A True Friend (Prov. 27:9, 10).
 11. Friend or Fool? (Prov. 13:20).

but the companion of fools suffers harm" (Proverbs 13:20, NRSV).

A TRUE FRIEND (Prov. 27:9, 10).

  What reason did God give for providing a companion for Adam?
Gen. 2:18.

    Deep in every heart lies a longing, even a craving, for companion-
ship. Adam in Eden felt such a need before God created Eve. Lacking a
friend with whom he could share his life, Adam could not have gained
the greatest possible satisfaction from the beauties of a perfect world
or the delights of employment, exploration, and expanding powers. As
a social being, he needed the understanding, sympathy, and compan-
ionship of one who shared his nature. He needed someone with whom
he could share human love.
    Only once during Creation week did God say His plan was not
good (Gen. 2:18). If it were not good for Adam to be alone, then surely
God meant for marriage partners to be the best of friends. Marriage is
especially meaningful when this is the case. No other feature of the
marriage relationship can replace friendship. As friends, husband and
wife can communicate about mutual interests and joys, challenges and
sorrows. Spiritually and psychologically, the experience of having a
partner who is a closer friend than any other human being greatly
enriches our lives.
    Those who are not married, for whatever reason, may enjoy the
enriching experience of having close personal friends. Everyone needs
someone with whom she or he can share confidences, joys, and sor-
rows. Though unmarried, the apostle Paul found deep satisfaction in
the relationship of mutual dependence that he enjoyed with his fellow
laborers. (See Phil. 4:3.) Because God created us to be social beings,
we achieve our full potential in association with others.

 By what comparison does Solomon indicate the value of a friend?
What advice does he give? Prov. 27:9, 10.

   Ointment and perfume were often quite expensive. Usually composed of
olive oil, sweet spices, gum resins, or other aromatics, and often preserved
in alabaster jars, these ointments were a sought-after luxury in Palestine.
Some friends may be more like a cheap fragrance—easy to acquire, easy
to give up, and not particularly valuable. But just as the pleasing aroma of
a high-quality perfume "makes the heart glad" (NRSV) and lasts a long
time, so does a true Christian friend inspire hope and faith. Such a friend is
rare and worth more than silver and gold.

   How would you define a true friend? By what comparison
 would you indicate the value of such a person?

                                                                           89

FRIEND OR FOOL? (Prov. 13:20).

  What principle should we keep in mind when choosing our friends?
Prov. 13:20.


    Not only are we judged by the company we keep, but we tend to take
on as our own the characteristics of our friends. The people and the
things we love shape and fashion us. By beholding we become changed.
(See 2 Cor. 3:18.)
   "The youth fail to realize how sensibly both their character and their
reputation are affected by their choice of associates. One seeks the
company of those whose tastes and habits and practices are congenial.
He who prefers the society of the ignorant and vicious to that of the
wise and good shows that his own character is defective. His tastes
and habits may at first be altogether dissimilar to the tastes and habits
of those whose company he seeks; but as he mingles with this class, his
thoughts and feelings change. . . . As a stream always partakes of the
property of the soil through which it runs, so the principles and habits
of youth invariably become tinctured with the character of the company
in which they mingle."—Messages to Young People, pp. 411, 412.
   Since our friends inevitably influence us, let us choose them wisely.

  Why does Proverbs 24:1, 2 caution us about the type of people with
whom we associate?


   Fostering an inclination or cherishing a desire usually results in
giving in to it. While we cannot of ourselves change our hearts or
control our inclinations and impulses, we do have the power of choice
and can give our wills to God. "We can choose to serve God . . . then He
will work in us to will and to do according to His good pleasure. Thus
our whole nature will be brought under the control of Christ."—The
Ministry of Healing, p. 176.
   Close friendship with those who are not serving Christ involves
certain hazards. Unconsciously, we are likely to absorb their habits.
Associating too closely with those whose moral and ethical standards
are not in harmony with the gospel can tarnish our purity and reputa-
tion.

    Since association with unbelieving friends is filled with spiri-
 tual danger, how can a Christian maintain spiritual integrity
 while seeking to win others to Christ? How does our motive have
 a determining effect on this process?

WOUNDS OR KISSES? (Prov. 27:6).

  What can we learn about true friends from Proverbs 27:6 and
27:17?


   "Deceitful" kisses (KJV) bring to mind Judas the betrayer. In direct
contrast is the Friend of friends who "was wounded for our transgres-
sions," "was bruised for our iniquities" (Isa. 53:5).
   "People learn from one another, just as iron sharpens iron" (Prov.
27:17, TEV). In order to make our learning well rounded, we need
three kinds of friends.
    1. The friend we most readily recognize is a peer, someone with
whom we share ideals, concepts, and plans; someone who inspires us
to be our best and achieve the most for the right reasons.
    2. We also need a model, someone who personifies the goals we
have set for ourselves, who has traveled the path before us, and to
whom we can look for wise counsel. In some cultures, the segregation
of generations and the breakup of extended families have brought
unnecessary trauma and loneliness for the senior members of society,
while at the same time robbing those who could benefit from their
long experience.
    3. Then there is the friend who admires us, regarding us as a pattern.
We need to cherish the opportunity to be a friend to such a person, though
the relationship may not be to our personal advantage. Only in eternity will
we know the extent of our influence on such a person.
    Bigotry, exclusiveness, and favoritism cannot reside in the heart of
the true Christian. We need to remember "the Christlikeness of exhibit-
 ing a kindly interest, a social disposition, toward those who are in the
 greatest need, even though these may not be . . . [our] own chosen
 companions."—Messages to Young People, p. 406.

   Why is the counsel in Proverbs 17:9 so important?


   Why is criticism and gossip so damaging to friendship?


  "No Christian parent should permit gossip to be repeated in the
family circle or remarks to be made disparaging the member of the
church."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 242.

    What further roles should conversation have among Christian
 friends? How can these roles play a part in your conversation
 with friends?

THE SAVING VALUE OF HOSPITALITY (Prov. 25:21, 22).

   While the Christian's best and most intimate friends should be those
who share his or her principles and convictions, it is also true that
sanctified socializing can be a means of blessing others and bringing
them into a proper relationship with God.

   An enemy can sometimes become a friend through social contact of
the right kind. How does the Bible writer suggest we go about this?
Prov. 25:21, 22.


   How did Jesus express the same sentiment we find in Proverbs
25:21, 22 and in Matthew 5:43-45?


   We can win souls through friendship. We can attract to Christ and
His love those who do not understand the distinctive message of
Adventism, as we include them in our social occasions. When we
remain separate from them, unwilling or unable to relate to them in
relaxed social settings, they will not find our message attractive. Kind-
ness is hard to resist. Most people readily give in to it!
   Jesus associated with sinful people. In fact, the religious leaders of
the day strongly criticized Him for it. (See Luke 5:30-32; 7:33, 34.) Jesus
pointed out that He was associating with sinners because they needed
His ministry. Never did He condone or excuse sin, and never did He
enter into the evil pleasures and activities of the people for whom He
was working. He staunchly resisted, however, the pompous exclusive-
ness of the Pharisees. Jesus demonstrated how we can win social
outcasts for His kingdom and how we can most effectively reflect His
love and witness for His truth.
   "The example of Christ in linking Himself with the interests of hu-
manity should be followed by all who preach His word, and by all who
have received the gospel of His grace. We are not to renounce social
communion. We should not seclude ourselves from others. In order to
reach all classes, we must meet them where they are. They will seldom
seek us of their own accord."—The Desire of Ages, p. 152.

   What social programs does your church conduct that are
attractive to nonmembers? How often do you have hospitality
dinners for Sabbath visitors? If you have been doing these kinds
of things, what results have you seen?
   To what types of unstructured social occasions in your home
do you invite nonbelievers?

KINDNESS TO STRANGERS (Prov. 31:20).

   What is one class of strangers whose lot in life the Bible urges us
to relieve? Prov. 21:13; 31:20. How would you suggest that indi-
viduals and the church should follow this counsel?


   Have you considered the needs of the homeless in your commu-
nity? Some conferences have begun a special ministry to these people.
If your church is located in or near a large city, what can you person-
ally do for those who are without homes or jobs?

  What directive is common to the following scriptures? Rom. 12:10-
113; 1 Pet. 4:9, 10.


   "These admonitions have been strangely neglected. . . . Among
our own people the opportunity of showing hospitality is not re-
garded as it should be, as a privilege and a blessing. There is alto-
gether too little sociability, too little of a disposition to make room for
two or three more at the family board, without embarrassment or
parade. . . . By the unexpected guest a welcome is appreciated far more
than is the most elaborate preparation."—Testimonies for the Church,
vol. 6, p. 343.
   "Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some people
have entertained angels without knowing it" (Heb. 13:2, NIV). What a
privilege! Angels are with us always, whether or not we can see them.
They enjoy being in homes where people express love and kindness
with their words, actions, and looks, and they are pleased at the sight
of a well-regulated, orderly family that is willing to share good things
with others. (See Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students,
p. 115; Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2, p. 259; vol. 6, p. 342.)

   Check the statements below that you want to incorporate into your
own experience:
          I will pray that God will make me capable of being a true
Christian friend to others.
          With the help of God, I will choose close friends who will
help rather than hinder my spiritual life.
          With God's help, I will seek to develop my social abili-
ties, so I can reach more souls for His kingdom.
          I will gladly share with others what God has entrusted to me.

     Now choose one or two of the items you have checked and
 list steps you can take to incorporate them into your life.

                                                                          93

FURTHER STUDY: For biblical examples of true friendship, read
Ruth 1:6-18; 1 Samuel 18:1-4; 2 Kings 2:1-3; Matthew 27:55, 56;
Luke 1:39-45.
   Read "Hospitality," "Our Social Needs," and "Safe and Unsafe As-
sociation," in The Adventist Home, pp. 445-465.

   "If choice is made of companions who fear the Lord, the influence
will lead to truth, to duty, and to holiness. A truly Christian life is a
power for good. But, on the other hand, those who associate with men
and women of questionable morals, of bad principles and practices,
will soon be walking in the same path. . . . To walk in the counsel of
the ungodly is the first step toward standing in the way of sinners
and sitting in the seat of the scornful."—Testimonies for the Church,
vol. 4, p. 587.
   "The warmth of true friendship, the love that binds heart to heart, is
a foretaste of the joys of heaven."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 360.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. List and discuss ways spouses can develop and maintain a close
     friendship with each other.

     2. How can people who are not married apply the guidelines for
        husbands and wives to their close personal friendship?

     3. The segregation of generations is a problem for some cultures.
        We talk about it, but what can we do to correct the problem or,
        better still, prevent it?

     4. Name and discuss the only thing that will erase bigotry, favorit-
        ism, and exclusiveness from the heart.

     5. Most modern enemies will not be hungry or thirsty. So how else
        can we "heap coals of fire" upon their heads?

     6. Besides those who do not have jobs or homes, what other types of
        "strangers" might there be in your community? How can you
        help them?

SUMMARIZE this week's lesson by making a brief outline for the
following areas in the theology of friendship: (1) companionship among
loved ones who share similar values and convictions, (2) hospitality
that brings others to Christ, and (3) kindness to strangers. Be sure to
include Bible texts in your outlines.

                      God's Police Squad
                             J. H. Zachary

    General Ramiro Rojas is the commander of one of the most
unusual police forces in the world. He leads the 130,000 officers of the
national police force in Peru.
    Several years ago an event took place that changed the course of
Rojas's life and eventually touched the lives of millions in Peru. One
of Rojas's close friends and police officers was a faithful Seventh-day
Adventist. When the Adventist officer died in an accident, his widow
told Rojas, "If my husband were alive today, he would want you to
take his place as the only Adventist police officer in this city."
    "I will do it," Rojas promised. And he did.
    Rojas's new beliefs brought changes to his command. His troops
became known for their honesty, refusal to take bribes, and high
morale. The commander of the police at the time was dealing with
serious ethical problems in the police force. He noticed the differences
in Rojas' unit and asked his secret for raising the standard among
those under his command.
    Rojas answered, "Love for Jesus is changing my officers. They are
learning to honor God." Rojas's squad became a model for the entire
police force. Eventually, Ramiro Rojas became the commander of the
entire Peruvian police force. His influence and leadership touches
every police officer and virtually every citizen of the country.
    When we visited Rojas in his office, he invited us to kneel for
prayer. I was impressed as he poured out his heart to God.
    A few minutes later his staff entered, and the general led them in a
rousing gospel song, a Bible reading, and a short talk. After several
staff members prayed, the group sang another lively song. After they
returned to their duties General Rojas said, "We begin each day with
God."
    Rojas introduced us to Samuel Cueva, a recent graduate of Andrews
 University whose job is to share the ethical principles of the Bible
 with the police force of Peru. Rojas has formed small groups in every
 police unit to minister to the officers' spiritual needs. More than 500
 officers have accepted Christ as their Saviour and been baptized. No
 pressure is placed on these officers to make a decision for Christ. They
 simply accept the spirit of prayer and Bible study put into place by
 Rojas and his team. The Holy Spirit does the rest.
     General Rojas said, "God has changed the spirit of my officers!"

Drink From Your Own Spring




Sabbath Afternoon
FRIDAY IS NEARLY SPENT. The glow in the heavens sinks to-
ward the distant hills. A breeze flutters the leaves of a tree and makes
the flowers dance. A stream sings over stones and birds swoop and
call. Animals of all sizes cavort through the tall grasses. The new
world is complete. But where are the rulers?
     God is down at the lalceshore . sculpting. He's forming from the mud
... a . . . man! Now He's leaning overthe face; now, rocking back on His heels,
He reaches out His hand to the man, and they stand together. Magnificent!
     Next, according to an old tale, God says to the angels looking on, "You
think that's good? You think I could do even better?" and He made a
woman! No, he had her in mind all along, a perfect complement to man.
Together, in a unique and total union, they symbolized God's love for His
people. And God celebrated the first marriage.
     This lesson will take passages in Proverbs that deal with marriage,
together with other supporting scriptures, to develope a picture of one of
God's best gifts. We will also see why perversion of His masterpiece
wreaks havoc and how contention sours peace.
     But virtue is available to all who seek it! So study on, even if you are
unmarried. You will find it interesting to see how many of the principles
discussed apply to close personal friendships and to relationships in
general.

MARRIAGE—A DIVINE MASTERPIECE, PART 1 (Prov.
18:22).

  According to Proverbs 19:14, where can a person find an intelli-
gent, sensible, and understanding spouse?


    "What God hath joined together." The last part of the verse may be
translated "But from the Lord is a woman who acts prudently." The Hebrew
verb means "to act wisely, understandingly, with insight and comprehen-
sion." A spouse who acts in such a manner is truly a gift from God. The Lord
is the ultimate matchmaker. No one knows better the secret needs of each
individual, and no one has the same ability to bring together the right two
persons. Because He is the divine Father of love, no one can care as much as
He or provide better for the happiness of the couple He has united.
    Why is a good spouse from the Lord? Could it be because the person is first
given to Him? But how does God guide two individuals together? Providence
is only one factor, as is strong emotion. Individual convictions must be
compared, preferences sorted out and matched up, and counsel sought from
parents and spiritual mentors. Decisions should be made from evidence, not
impulse or demonstration, and aided by all the values accumulated up to that
time. In all, the couple seek God's will. The true love is born in heaven!

  What activity did God provide for Adam before He created Eve?
Gen. 2:18-23.


   Why did God do this?


    "For this reason [see Gen. 2:23] a man will leave his father and mother
and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh" (v. 24, NIV).
With these words, God pronounced the union between Adam and Eve.
    The physical union of a husband and wife is a representation of the total
bonding of their lives. They are united not only physically but also
mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. The love they share between them
is like no other. Two have become one.
    This four-fold bond is basic to a successful marriage. It is a unity
made possible through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in both individuals
and illustrated through the ability to have a part in continuing God's
creation—a union of cells that actually forms a new person. " 'Be fruitful
and multiply' " (Gen. 1:28, NW) was part of the Lord's plan for humanity.

   Because our spouses, families, and friends are gifts from God,
 how should we treat them?

                                                                            97

MARRIAGE—A DIVINE MASTERPIECE, PART 2 (Eph. 5:21-
31).

   The relationship between Christ and His church illustrates the rich-
ness of the spiritual oneness that is to exist between husband and wife.
(See Eph. 5:21-31.) Just as spiritual life is possible only by union with
Christ, so marital union is complete only as Christ creates it. Any
counterfeit union involves being unequally yoked together (2 Cor.
6:14). The consequences are disorder and disaster. Only the house
built on righteousness will stand. (See Prov. 12:7.)

   After the Fall, what change took place in the husband-wife relation-
ship? Gen. 3:16.


     What counsel does Paul give to husbands? Eph. 5:25-33.


   Paul shows here that marriage does not consist of one-sided submis-
sion. Because the husband is to give himself up for his wife just as
Christ gave Himself up for the church (v. 25), this submission is mutual.
How did Christ give Himself up for the church? He died for it! Indeed
then, Ephesians 5:25-33 calls for the husband to make an even greater
act of devotion toward his wife than the previous verses call for the wife
to make toward her husband!
   One of the purposes of the gospel is to restore the marriage relation
to the state of harmony and equality that existed in Eden. Husbands
who function as domestic dictators are not following the biblical ideal.
Are they willing to attend lovingly to their wives as Christ attends to
the church? The concept held by some that a wife should submit
obediently to her spouse's demands is bound to create marital unhappi-
ness. A wife should be an equal partner in the decision-making process.
The husband should tenderly consider her feelings and her will, and he
should do all in his power to contribute to her sense of personal worth.

    If you are married, can you say the following is true in your
relationship with your spouse? "Let each give love rather than exact
it.... The consciousness of being appreciated is a wonderful stimulus
and satisfaction. Sympathy and respect encourage the striving after
excellence, and love itself increases as it stimulates to nobler aims....
    "Do not try to compel each other to yield to your wishes. You
cannot do this and retain each other's love."—The Ministry of
Healing, p. 361.

     How might the above principles apply to other relationships?

STRANGE PERVERSION (Prov. 5:18-20).

   How does Solomon counsel us against immorality?

   Prov. 2:1,16-19

   Prov. 5:1-13

   Prov. 6:23-33

   Prov. 7:4-27


    It has always been common to regard biblical teaching on moral
questions as old-fashioned and incompatible with the demands of
society. In His mercy, however, God has given us His moral law as a
protecting hedge to keep us from physical suffering, emotional instabil-
ity, and spiritual emptiness.
    When the sexual union is indulged outside of marriage, as in premari-
tal or extramarital affairs (or in perversions), the relationship weakens
spiritual and emotional health and, thus, is contrary to God's will. It may
also be destructive to physical health. Individuals are betrayed and
traumatized, never to be quite the same in this life.
    God will forgive anyone who sincerely repents. Yet the scars will remain.
This is a warning to those who might think that, because God will forgive,
they can live as they please without suffering dreadful results. (See Prov.
9:13-18.) In discussing these dangers, Solomon counsels: "Drink water
from your own cistern, running water from your own well. . . . May you
rejoice in the wife of your youth" (Prov. 5:15, 18, NIV).

  How does Jesus' teaching in Matthew 5:27-30 magnify the sev-
enth commandment? (Exod. 20:14).


  "Christ points out that character is determined, not so much by the
outward act, as by the inward attitude that motivates the act. The
outward act merely reflects and activates the inward attitude. He who
would commit a wrong act if he thought he could escape detection, and
who is restrained only by that fear, is, in the sight of God, guilty."
—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, pp. 336, 337.

    What attitude do you adopt toward a person in your church
 who has fallen into moral impurity? How would you go about
 helping such a person rise above past mistakes and accept Christ's
 saving grace?

                                                                          99

A QUARRELSOME SPOUSE (Prov. 21:19).

  How do the following verses illustrate the problem of a nagging
spouse?

   Prov. 27:15


   Prov. 21:9


   Prov. 21:19


    "Leaking roofs were common in the East, and the constant dripping
tried the nerves of the inhabitants much as does a nagging woman. . . .
   "In ancient Palestine for most of the year a man might live in com-
parative comfort on the flat roof of his house. . . .Solomon countends
that it is better to be exposed to the wind and rain than to the quarrel-
some and vexing tongue of a contentious woman."—The SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 3, pp. , 1012, 1018.

  What counsel for all Christians is particularly appropriate for a
quarrelsome spouse? Eph. 4:29.


   Attitude reform can begin in more than one place. The ill-natured
person can determine to consecrate her or his heart and lips to God and
speak only words that will minister grace to the hearers. God will give
us the power for this noble task.
   The marriage partner can also help. Sincere words of positive appre-
ciation spoken from a heart of love go a long way toward soothing the
troubled nerves of a distracted spouse. Just knowing somebody cares—
especially the one you love the most—lifts a great burden from the
heart. Just as nagging is as irritating as a dripping roof or a leaky
faucet, so are kind words as refreshing "as dew and gentle showers to
the soul. The Scripture says of Christ that grace was poured into His
lips, that He might 'know how to speak a word in season to him that is
weary.' And the Lord bids us, 'Let your speech be alway with grace,'
`that it may minister grace unto the hearers.' "—The Adventist Home,
p. 435.

  Think of a time when someone's kind words and thoughtful
deeds helped to ease tensions in your home. How can you do the
same for others without appearing to meddle in their business?

A VIRTUOUS SPOUSE (Prov. 31:10-31).

   "Who can find a virtuous woman" (Prov. 31:10, NIV)? The question
implies a rarity, not a total lack. The real question is: Who can be a
virtuous person? Every person can, for God is in the business of
making women and men virtuous, of helping them build noble charac-
ters equal to the burdens and demands of daily life.

  What is the value of a virtuous person? Prov. 31:10.


   Pure rubies belong to the royalty of the mineral world because they
are hard, flawlessly transparent, dazzling in color, and rare.

   How does the virtuous person reveal the following traits in her or
his character?

   Diligence (Prov. 31:13, 17, 18, 27)



   Efficiency (Prov. 31:14, 16, 24)



   Compassion (Prov. 31:20, 26)



   Beauty (Prov. 31:22, 25)




  How would you "translate" some of these, such as "she selects wool
and flax" (31:13), into today's daily life?

   All of the above are traits any person can have. Their rewards are
great, for those who know such people call them blessed. Spouses of
such people praise them (Prov. 31:28, 29). Their example challenges
others, and their works bring honor to loved ones and to themselves.
Best of all, their life glorifies the God they love (Prov. 31:30).

   How should a Christian husband or wife act toward a harsh,
 unkind, unbelieving spouse?

                                                                   101

FURTHER STUDY: What men and women in the Bible displayed
the characteristics of virtuous men and women? How do their stories
inspire you to have faith in the Lord's ability to transform your life?
   Read the following sections from The Adventist Home: "Mutual
Obligations," pp. 114-120; "Marital Duties and Privileges," pp. 121-128;
"The Kind of Husband Not to Be," pp. 224-228.

   "She [the virtuous wife] opens her mouth with wisdom, and on her
tongue is the law of kindness" (Prov. 31:26, NKJV).
   "The Lord will help every one of us where we need help the most in
the grand work of overcoming and conquering self. Let the law of
kindness be upon your lips and the oil of grace in your heart. This will
produce wonderful results. . . . By beholding the character of Christ
you will become changed into His likeness. The grace of Christ alone
can change your heart and then you will reflect the image of the Lord
Jesus. God calls upon us to be like Him. . . . We are to bear the divine
image."—Ellen G. White Comments, The SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 3, p. 1164.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Remembering Solomon's union with heathen women in direct
     opposition to God's will, what special importance should we give
     to his counsel regarding women and wives?

   2. Christians have clear moral instruction set forth in Scrip-
      ture depicting the husband-wife relation as the only sexual
      standard of conduct. How should we respond to the "mod-
      ern standards" that confront us, especially when they occur
      in our families?

  3. Identify some of the major principles this week's lesson touched
     upon. Which of them can we appropriately apply to relation-
     ships in general?

SUMMARIZE this week's lesson by challenging your soul with the
following questions: *What am I contributing to my relationships that
will be a blessing to myself and others? *How am I a hindrance to my
spouse, relatives, and friends? How can I change? *Am I a quarrel-
some person?* If I were to change the manner in which I react to
things that displease me, would I bring greater happiness to my spouse
and those around me?

                God Did Not Let Him Travel
                    Pedro dos Santos Marinho

    Pastor Pedro dos Santos Marinho of Brazil was on his way to spend
Sabbath with believers in an isolated region of his district. He had
planned his trip so he would not have to travel on Sabbath, but when he
arrived in Boninal, where he would transfer to another bus, he learned
that his bus had left early.
    There was no other bus to his destination that day, so Pastor
Marinho had to remain in Boninal overnight. He checked into the little
hotel near the bus depot, then he found a telephone and called the
church elder to let him know that he would arrive on Saturday.
    Tired and disappointed, Pastor Marinho returned to his room to
study the Sabbath School lesson. As he read, it seemed that he heard a
voice saying, "You have not spoken about Me to anyone today, not
even the hotel owner." This is true, the pastor thought. I have been so
wrapped up in what happened that I allowed a good opportunity to
pass by to share Jesus in this town that apparently has no Adventists.
    Pastor Marinhoprayed that God would lead him to those whom He
wanted him to meet. Then he ate a quick lunch and set out to distribute
pamphlets.
    At the fourth house a woman answered the door. When she learned
that this man was a Seventh-day Adventist pastor, she said, "You have
a sister here!"
    "Really?" the surprised pastor asked. "Where does she live?" The
woman arranged for someone to take Pastor Marinho to the home of an
 Adventist woman. When the pastor introduced himself, the woman
 who answered the door shouted, "Aparecida, come here and meet your
 brother!"
    Aparecida appeared at the door and told the surprised pastor, "I
 have been praying for two years that God would send a pastor here.
 Today He has sent you!"
    Pastor Marinho visited with the woman for quite some time and
 promised that he would return the following day. As he walked back to
 his room he realized why God had allowed him to miss his bus. God
 had a work for the pastor to do in that town.
    On Sabbath morning he returned to visit until it was time to catch
 his bus. He promised to return again.
    Pastor Marinho kept his promise. In time he held evangelistic meet-
 ings in Boninal, and today more than 30 believers have joined the church
 by baptism, including Aparecida's parents and one of her sisters.

           To Make a Disciple




Sabbath Afternoon
DISCIPLINE IS NOT SYNONYMOUS WITH PUNISHMENT. A
disciple is a convinced follower of a school of thought or an individual
teacher. One who is disciplined is also a disciple (the two words share
the same root) and comes to reflect characteristics of the mentor.
   Christians are disciples of Christ. Are children disciples of their
parents? If parents were to see their job as making disciples, how
would their methods of discipline change? If parents understood disci-
pline to be the whole, broad spectrum of instruction and experience,
and if their correction were redemptive rather than punitive, what
could be the results to those disciplined.
   To be trained like animals is not God's plan. "Every human being,
created in the image of God, is endowed with a power akin to the
Creator—individuality, power to think and to do. . . . It is the work of
true education to develop this power, to train the youth to be thinkers,
and not mere reflectors of other men's thought."—Education, p. 17.
   What is the goal of discipline? Do we ever grow out of being a
disciple? Why do we need correction at all? And what is it that God
wants from us? Discussion of these questions should provide valuable
insight for all of us, for we are all disciples.

THE WEEK AT A GLANCE:
  I. Parenting (Prov. 22:6).
 11. Discipling (Prov. 3:11, 12; 13:24).
I11. Despise Not Correction (Prov. 12:15).
IV. What God Hates (Prov. 6:16-19).
 V. Heart Work (Prov. 3:1).

MEMORY TEXT: "My child, do not forget my teaching, but let
your heart keep my commandments" (Proverbs 3:1, NRSV).

PARENTING (Prov. 22:6).

   "To parents is committed the great work of educating and training their
children for the future, immortal life. . . . No work ever undertaken by man
requires greater skill than the proper training and education of youth and
children."—Child Guidance, pp. 38, 39.

   What is the meaning of the action word train in Proverbs 22:6?


   Other versions read: "Teach a child how he should live, and he will
remember it all his life" (TEV).
   "Teach a child to choose the right path, and when he is older he will
remain upon it" (TLB).
   "Train up a child in the way he chould go [and in keeping with his
individual gift or bent], and when he is old he will not depart from it."
According to Cynthia Tobias of Learning Styles Unlimited, the original
Hebrew of the verb translated "train" is used uniquely in Proverbs 22:6. It
referred to the clearing out of the mouth of a newly born baby, and meant,
"Create an environment for life."
   Thus, we could understand the verse to mean, "Create an environment
for life for a child, in keeping with his gifts or bent, and when he is old he
will not depart from it."

  What relationships between children and parents do the fol-
lowing passages speak of?

   Prov. 10:1

   Prov. 27:11

   Prov. 28:7

   Prov. 29:15

   Prov. 30:11-14

   The last phrase of Proverbs 22:6 states a general principle to which
there are exceptions. God gives freedom of choice. We all decide our own
destiny. Thus, neglience or faulty parenting is not necessarily to blame for
wayward offspring. God Himself lost one-third of His angel family through
no fault of His own.

    Aside from parental guidance, name some of the influences
 that instruct your child. How do these influences work, and why
 are they so influential?
                                                                          105

DISCIPLINING (Prov. 3:11, 12; 13:24).

   How does Proverbs 3:11, 12 and 13:24 suggest we should disci-
pline children?


    God loves us; He has only our best good at heart. Therefore, and to that
end, He disciplines us. We should follow His example in the way we
discipline our children.
   "To direct a child's development without hindering it by undue control
should be the study of both parent and teacher. Too much management is as
bad as too little. The effort to 'break the will' of a child is a terrible mistake.
Minds are constituted differently; while force may secure the outward
submission, the result with many children is a more determined rebellion of
the heart. Even should the parent or teacher succeed in gaining the control he
seeks, the outcome may be no less harmful to the child. . . . The will should
be guided and molded, but not ignored or crushed. Save the strength of the
will; in the battle of life, it will be needed."—Education, pp. 288, 289.
    When all else has failed, physical punishment may be necessary. But
violent physical abuse is contrary to the spirit of Christ and is counterproduc-
rive in itself. Punishment administered in anger only creates bitterness, resent-
ment, and future problems for all concerned. "And you, fathers, do not
provoke your children to wrath," "don't overcorrect your children or make it
difficult for them to obey the commandment" (Eph. 6:4, TEV, Philips).
   "Do not provoke." "This negative advice is essential if the obedience
required of the children is to rest on a moral basis. The parallel passage in
Colossians gives the reason for this admonition: 'Lest they be discour-
aged' (Col. 3:21)."—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1041.
   "There is great strength and blessing in praying together in our families,
with and for our children. When my children have done wrong, and I have
talked with them kindly and then prayed with them, I have never found it
necessary after that to punish them. Their hearts would melt in tenderness
before the Holy Spirit that came in answer to prayer."—Child Guidance,
p. 525.

   If you are a parent, can you say that the training you are giving your
children is helping to make them faithful disciples of Christ? Examine
your heart and your conduct to determine how you need to improve your
child training.


    How do the basic principles by which we should train our chil-
 dren relate to manager-employee and teacher-student relation-
 ships? How do the same principles affect the manner in which a
 church should discipline unfaithful members?

DESPISE NOT CORRECTION (Prov. 12:15).

   Independence is an instinctive aspect of human nature. We feel that we
can handle situations alone quite successfully. In our haste to do things our
own way, we ignore Christ. God exercises much patience with His self-
deceived, self-reliant children.

  What does God know about our choices that we tend to forget?
Prov. 16:25 (compare Jer. 10:23).


   Jesus said, " 'Without Me you can do nothing,' " (John 15:5, NKJV). But
by relying on Him, we can do everything we need to do. (See Phil. 4:13.) A
disciplined disciple studies His Word to understand His will, chooses to
follow that will, and relies on His power to resist temptation. Discipline also
has practical, everyday connections, for God wants our temporal lives to be
successful, even as the spiritual lives prosper. (See 3 John 2.) This level of
discipline will not look the same for everyone due to the different needs and
temperaments of each individual. But whatever your struggle, take it to God
and keep growing. As victory comes, it will be sweet.
    But "fools think their own way is right" (Prov. 12:15) and "there is a
way that seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death" (Prov. 15:25,
NIV; see also 13:18; 29:21). The last chapters of the book of Judges
provide a tragic illustration of these verses: "In those days there was no
king in Israel; all the people did what was right in their own eyes" (17:6,
NRSV). There is no record of anyone following the counsel of Jehovah.
Confusion and violence reigned.
    But God is never caught off-guard; He is still the Ruler and Over-ruler.
"Above the distractions of earth He sits enthroned; all things are open to
His divine survey; and from His great and calm eternity He orders that
which His providence sees best."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 417.

   What kind of instruction does Proverbs 16:22 urge us to avoid?


   Isaiah 8:20 invites us to test all counsel by the teachings of the Bible,
and John 14:26 encourages us to seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit in
every situation. If we are listening, God has ways to get through to us.
The Bible is the ultimate test (see Isa. 8:20), and the Holy Spirit will
guide us into all truth (John 16:13). There still may be "gray areas" when
we do not know exactly what to do; but where we have a "Thus saith the
Lord," "openmindedness" to a contradicting philosophy is no virtue.

    Ask yourself, What kind of instruction am I allowing to shape my
life? Is it helping me along the right road?

                                                                           107

WHAT GOD HATES (Prov. 6:16-19).

   List some of the things that are especially hateful to God.

           Text                         The Things God Hates


   Prov. 6:16-19


   Prov. 15:26


   Prov. 20:10, 19, 20, 22


   "A proud look" (Prov. 6:17). "Self-exaltation prevents a man from
confessing his sin and humbling his soul before God. As long as it
persists, salvation is impossible. The proud man is barred from the gates
of life just as surely as if God hated him (see Job 21:22; Ps. 18:27 . . . )."
—The SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 967.
    Children sing in Sabbath School, "Jesus loves me when I'm good,
when I do the things I should; Jesus loves me when I'm bad, tho' it makes
Him very sad." Is this true? Indeed it is! God loves the sinner but not the
sin. The great problem in salvation is how to save the sinner without saving
(and thus perpetuating) the sin. God, however, found a way of escape for
us. Jesus died to give us another chance at life. Through the provisions of
the Cross we can be made free from "the law of sin and death" (Rom. 8:2).
   There are those who become so bound to sin that it is inseparable from
them. When the sin is destroyed, they must be destroyed with it.

   What attitude does the Lord have toward religious practices that
are not motivated by our love for Him? Prov. 15:8; 21:27; 28:9.


   The sacrifices and prayers of pretenders are worthless to God. They are a
farce. Gifts and righteous works do not earn favor in heaven for the un-
repentant. God is not bought. And what does He want, besides our hearts?
   But when sinners acknowledge their need and accept Christ's merits,
they are no longer considered sinners. Their prayers are welcome, for God
has promised, "Anyone who comes to Me I will never drive away" (John
6:37, NKJV).

    Why do you engage in certain religious practices? Does tradition
 dictate that you do so? Or, is it because you truly love the Lord?

HEART WORK (Prov. 3:1).

    What problem persisted among God's chosen people in both Old
Testament times and during the period when Jesus walked among
them? Isa. 29:13, 14; Matt. 15:7-9. To what extent does this problem
still exist today? Rev. 3:14-20.


   We are Laodicea. Our problem stems from the spiritual condition of
our hearts. We are lukewarm. If we were cold, the Lord says we would
be better off. We would be more likely to wake up, recognize our
pathetic condition, and seek His help. If our heart were truly filled with
His Spirit, we would be "hot." Too often we attempt to change by
attempting to conform to mere rules and regulations without genuine
heart surrender to God.
   Where does God begin the work of transformation? "My child, do
not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments"
(Prov. 3:1, NRSV). (See also Prov. 23:26; Rom. 12:2.) Having our names
on church membership books is not enough. "Profession is as nothing
in the scale. It is character that decides destiny."—Christ's Object
Lessons, p. 74.
   The majority of God's people still worship in churches around us,
waiting to be called out by the moving invitation of the Holy Spirit. (See
Rev. 18:1-4; The Great Controversy, pp. 390, 464; Testimonies for the
Church, vol. 8, p. 41.) If we seek Him with all our heart, the Lord will
pour upon us the Holy Spirit so that we will have the spiritual power to
reach honest souls who need to hear the final invitation of mercy.

  What remedy for our condition does the Great Physician offer?
Ezek. 36:26, 27 (compare Rom. 7:14, 24, 25).


   "Who can say, 'I have kept my heart pure; I am clean and without
sin'?" (Prov. 20:9, NIV). No one can make such a claim. "For all have
sinned, and fall short of the glory of God" (Rom. 3:23). "Be not
discouraged because your heart seems hard. Every obstacle, every
internal foe, only increases your need of Christ. He came to take away
the heart of stone, and give you a heart of flesh. Look to Him for
special grace to overcome your peculiar faults."—Messages to Young
People, p. 112.

    The Lord's plea to us is: "Above all else, guard your heart, for it is
 the wellspring of life" (Prov. 4:23, NIV). Today, hear Him making that
 plea to you personally. Pray to Him now that He will help you to guard
 your heart, the wellspring of eternal life with Him.

                                                                       109

FURTHER STUDY: Review an incident in David's life that illus-
trates the principles of discipline we studied in this week's lesson:
2 Samuel 11-12:1-25; Psalm 51. Name the specific principles in-
volved. How can you illustrate these principles in your life?
   Read "Discipline," pp. 287-297 in Education.

   "Trials and obstacles are the Lord's chosen methods of discipline
and His appointed conditions of success. He who reads the hearts of
men knows their characters better than they themselves know them. He
sees that some have powers and susceptibilities which, rightly directed,
might be used in the advancement of His work. In His providence He
brings these persons into different positions and varied circumstances
that they may discover in their character the defects which have been
concealed from their own knowledge. He gives them opportunity to
correct these defects and to fit themselves for His service. Often He
permits the fires of affliction to assail them that they may be purified.
   "The fact that we are called upon to endure trial shows that the Lord
Jesus sees in us something precious which He desires to develop."
—The Ministry of Healing, p. 471.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What is the best type of discipline? Explain why.

   2. How does the nature of the human will relate to the training of
      children and contribute to their development of moral power?

   3. We talk about heart work and following the truth as though
      people understand what we mean. What is our individual re-
      sponsibility in regard to the proclamation of the truth?

   4. Consider Jesus' life on this earth. How did He discipline
      people? Give specific examples.

SUMMARIZE this week's lesson by answering the following personal
questions: *Do I represent God accurately to the children with whom I
have contact? Do I combine love, justice, mercy, and truth in all my
dealings with them?
   *How do I learn to depend on Christ to direct my steps? How can I
come to the point of accepting His leading in my life?
   *Do I learn from the experience of others, or do I insist on trying
everything myself?
   *How will my life change when I cease living it my own independ-
ent way and allow God to recreate me as a true disciple in the image of
His Son?

                 They Refused to Give Up
                     John Osei Acheampong

    It is exciting and faith strengthening to see how powerful God
is and the miraculous manner in which He guards His truths and
His people when it will bring glory to His name.
    The church in Terchire, Ghana, is young. And Ghanaians, as
with many other cultures in Africa, are strongly influenced by
dreams and miracles.
    Stephen Badu is the youthful first elder of the church. Recently
he became seriously ill. He was sent to several doctors and even
hospitals for treatment, but the doctors could not diagnose his
illness. He could neither eat nor drink, and he rapidly grew weaker.
Eventually doctors declared that the illness was "spiritual" and
sent Badu home to die. Soon he fell into a coma.
    To see their beloved elder lying near death at such a young age
was a blow to the members' faith. The church elders called all the
church board members to take part in three days of fasting and
intercessory prayer on Badu's behalf. Immediately nearly all of
the church members joined in the fasting and prayer vigil.
    The church planned to end the fast with an evening prayer
watch for the entire church. But before the fast ended word came
that Stephen Badu had died. Friends urged the church members to
cease their fasting and praying. But the determined believers re-
 fused to give up. They claimed God's promise that "nothing is
impossible with God" ( Luke 1:37, NIV).
    As the three days of fasting and prayer ended, Stephen Badu,
 who had been pronounced dead, regained consciousness. Wit-
 nesses reported that he sat up and asked for something to eat.
 Doctors who had declared his case hopeless cannot explain his
 sudden revival except that it is a miracle.
    Today Badu is alive and well, as fit as a soldier, and working
 for Christ. Word of the miraculous way in which he was healed
 brought many visitors to the church. They wanted to see for
 themselves the power of God that these Adventist believers called
 down from heaven. So far four people have been baptized who
 first came inquiring about Badu's healing.

  John Osei Acheampong is a member of the Terchire Seventh-day
Adventist Church in Ghana.

          Bible Study Guide for First Quarter, 2001
   The first quarter Adult Sabbath School Bible Study Guide, entitled
"Great Prayers and Pray-ers of the Bible," focuses on the power of
prayer in the lives of biblical characters.

Lesson 1: The Model Pray-er and the Model Prayer.
THE WEEK AT A GLANCE:
Sunday: Jesus' Prayer Life (Luke 3:21, 22).
Monday: "'I Have Prayed for You, Peter— (Luke 22:31, 32).

Wednesday: " 'Give Us This Day"' (Matt. 6:11-13).
Thursday: Jesus' Principles of Prayer (Luke 11:5-13; 18:1-14).

MEMORY TEXT: Luke 11:9, 10.

SABBATH GEM: Prayer is the communication line between Head-
quarters and ground forces in battle. When Jesus entered enemy territory
to be with us, He showed us how to use this communication system.


Lesson 2: Prayers of Despair: Job
THE WEEK AT A GLANCE:
Sunday: Crisis! (Job 1, 2).
Monday: Job's Bitter Complaints to God (Job 7:7-21; 10).
Tuesday: Job's Cry for Justice (Job 9:32-35).

MEMORY TEXT: Job 23:10.

SABBATH GEM: Due to the nature of the great controversy between
Christ and Satan, an incredible amount of suffering exists. The best way
to maintain one's sanity in times of darkness is to continue praying, even
though it seems, at times, as though God does not hear.

    THE TWELVE STEPS OF
  ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS*
1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol—that our lives
   had become unmanageable.

2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could re-
   store us to sanity.

3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of
   God as we understood Him.

4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.

5. Admitted to God, to ourselves and to another human being the
   exact nature of our wrongs.

6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of
   character.

7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.

8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to
   make amends to them all.

9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except
    when to do so would injure them or others.

10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong
    promptly admitted it.

11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious
    contact with God, as we understood Him, praying only for knowl-
    edge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.

12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we
    tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these
    principles in all our affairs.
