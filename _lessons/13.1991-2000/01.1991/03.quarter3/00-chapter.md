          Introduction to the Thessalonian Epistles

      Living for His Coming
    This quarter we will examine themes and experiences from Paul's deeply
spiritual correspondence to the believers at Thessalonica. Thessalonica at the time
of Paul's ministry was one of several capitals in the Roman province of Macedonia.
This bustling seaport in Paul's day rivaled Corinth and Ephesus as a thoroughfare
of commerce and trade. A major attraction in the first century A.D. was the
celebrated amphitheater where gladiators fought to the death for the amusement of
citizens and their guests.
    Paul first visited Thessalonica during his second missionary journey, which is
thought to have occupied the years from A.D. 49 to 52. While visiting Asia Minor
he received the divine call to minister in Macedonia (Acts 16:6-10). At Philippi he
was bitterly opposed and, in fact, jailed. When released he departed to Thessalonica
(Acts 17:1).
    Today the city is named Saloniki. Although it is no longer a major trade center,
ships from many nations still come and go with cargos of oil, food, and animals.
Ninety-seven percent of the population is Christian (Greek Orthodox). There is also
a congregation of faithful Seventh-day Adventists.
    The letters of Paul to the church at Thessalonica, probably written between A.D.
50 and 52, give us in clear, concise language the apostle's concerns for the church,
which he had only recently established. Every pastor knows that congregations, as
well as persons, differ in personality. Unfailingly, the messages of Paul's Epistles
addressed the particular spiritual needs of his target group. What was written for the
Ephesians or the Galatians or the Philippians would not have fit as well the needs
of the Colossians or the congregation in Thessalonica. There is, however, useful
and needed help in every letter for every church in every place and time.
    The general theme of Paul's two Epistles to the Thessalonians is the need for
consistent practical godliness on the part of those who are living for Christ's return.
    As we study these two Epistles this quarter, we will enjoy learning about one of
the most lively and productive New Testament congregations. We will learn that, in
spite of the intervening centuries, the personality, the triumphs, and the travails of
the Thessalonian Christians parallel closely our present experiences and needs.
Also, we will learn much about the method and message of one of history's most
colorful and productive authors, who in human language presents a vital message
from God.

          Responding to the
             Divine Call
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Acts 17:1-11; 1 Thessalonians 1:1-6; 2:1-12;
5:1, 2.

SAP   MEMORY TEXT: "And a vision appeared to Paul in the night;
 PM   There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come
      over into Macedonia, and help us" (Acts 16:9).

GOOD RESULTS REQUIRE GOOD METHODS. To be successful
soul winners we must enter into a personal relationship with Jesus and fol-
low His methods and those of the apostles, adapting them to the age and
culture in which we live and work. The ministry of Paul provides valuable
principles for evangelistic outreach. The witness of the new believers in
Thessalonica illustrates the power of personal testimony.

LESSON OUTLINE
    I. Large-City Evangelism (Acts 17:1).
   11. Paul's Evangelistic Strategy (Acts 17:2).
  I11. The Heart of the Message (Acts 17:3; 1 Thess. 5:1, 2).
  IV. The Power of Personal Testimony (1 Thess. 2:8).
   V. Other Principles for Soul Winners (1 Thess. 1:1).

VITAL SOUL-WINNING PRINCIPLES DEMONSTRATED AT
THESSALONICA. Thessalonica, before God sent Paul there to preach
the saving gospel, was a heathen bastion containing one struggling Jewish
synagogue. Paul's coming made a difference, and Paul's spiritual dedica-
tion and methodology were crucial to the changes that were effected. It is
true that unless blessed by God the best of techniques will fail to achieve a
proper harvest. On the other hand, we must never forget that even in spir-
itual endeavors the quality of our results depends to some degree upon the
quality of our methodology. We are privileged to be able to catalogue
various aspects of Paul's evangelistic procedures in each of his Epistles. In
none are his techniques more clearly demonstrated than in his soul-
winning labors at Thessalonica.
   We will begin our studies by investigating the process whereby the
gospel found root in Thessalonica. We will take an up-close view of the

    PRAY for four lay preachers in Butembo, Zaire, to receive a
    two-year ministerial training course (US$250 each).

El 2. Why was Paul traveling through these and other Macedonian
        cities? Acts 16:4, 5, 8-10. Why do you think Paul chose Thes-
        salonica as a place of labor rather than one of the smaller cities
        between it and Philippi?



            A strategic center. "Thessalonica obviously had political and commer-
         cial importance, and was a strategic center of missionary activity. It was
         prosperous and populous. Traveling salesmen and their associates would
         have appealed to a discerning missionary of the first century no less than
         to one of the twentieth. Just as Jeannie Lawson and Gladys Aylward were
         impressed by the many mule-trains traveling hundreds of miles in China
         and in consequence set up the Inn of Eight Happinesses, so Paul was struck
         by the possibilities for evangelism if converted businessmen 'gossiped the
         gospel' in their travels. The two women missionaries to China told the
         stories of the gospel to the mule drivers in the inn. Paul preached Christ
                                                                                                                                                                   7
          Lesson 1                                                        July 6
      and started in the Jewish synagogue. The principle is the same."—Ronald
      A. Ward, Commentary on 1 & 2 Thessalonians (Waco, Tex.: Word Books,
      1973), p. 7.

      3. In what way did Paul's decision prove to be strategically sound?
         1 Thess. 1:6-8.



          The Thessalonians an example. "Of what were they an example? Ob-
      viously evangelistic zeal, 'for . . . the word . . . sounded forth' (v. 8), but
      this must have a base and the authors have given it. Their faith is the talk
      of everybody. They are hence typical examples of sound conversion, per-
      sistent faith, and zealous proclamation. They were typical because uncon-
      sciously they were imitating the case of Paul himself, the most normal of
      all instances (1 Tim. 1:16)."—Ward, Commentary on 1 & 2 Thessaloni-
      ans, pp. 37, 38.

         Paul's move was a practical one. His agenda was crowded, his time
      was limited, his resources were meager; he had to choose, and he decided
      correctly. He loved the souls in the smaller cities no less, but he understood
      that in Thessalonica he would have the platform from which the gospel
      would be spread abroad to cities both large and small. That his method was
      sound is seen in the influence that the young church quickly developed.
      Paul's work in Ephesus, Athens, Rome, Philippi, and other such cities
      shows that he was consistent in this methodology.

         What parallels can you draw for the work of the Seventh-day Ad-
      ventist Church today? Does this mean that smaller cities are less im-
      portant? By what methods can we evangelize smaller towns and vil-
      lages? Why is lay involvement so important to the proclamation of the
      gospel in cities large and small?

MON   11. PAUL'S EVANGELISTIC STRATEGY (Acts 17:2).

      4. With what population groups did Paul begin his witness at Thes-
         salonica? Why? Acts 17:1, 2.



          While Peter is recognized as the apostle to the Jews and Paul the apos-
      tle to the Gentiles, it is noteworthy that Paul often began his ministry in a
      city by preaching to the Jews. His habit in this regard is mentioned re-
      peatedly throughout his evangelistic experience. It was so at Berea (Acts
      17:10), at Corinth (Acts 18:4), at Ephesus (Acts 19:8), and, of course, at
      Thessalonica (Acts 17:2).
          In this evangelistic approach Paul shared Christ's concern for the "lost
      sheep of the house of Israel." (See Matt. 10:5-7 and 15:24.) Paul had a
      great burden for the salvation of the former chosen people of God. (See
      Rom. 9:1-5.)

      8
  Responding to the Divine Call                                     July 6
  What practical reasons can you give for Paul's beginning his work
by entering the synagogues of the Jews?

5. While Paul ordinarily began his efforts with the Jews, how wide a
   ministry did he customarily conduct? Acts 13:42, 44, 48; 18:4.



   The apostle sowed beside all waters. "There was a synagogue at
Thessalonica, attended not only by Jews but by a large number of devout
Greeks also. . . . These Gentiles, who were often called 'The God fearing,'
were attracted to the lofty ethical monotheism of the Jews and attended the
imageless worship of the synagogue with profit without becoming full
proselytes. It was from this congregation that Paul won his first converts to
Christ in Thessalonica, mainly Gentile (Acts 17:4; 1 Thess. 1:9)."—Ward,
Commentary on 1 & 2 Thessalonians, p. 8.
   Thus while Paul began with those who had a knowledge of God, he
quickly expanded to the full range of the Gentile population.
I11. THE HEART OF THE MESSAGE (Acts 17:3; 1 Thess. 5:1, 2).

6. What primary instrument did Paul use in his approach to the
   people at Thessalonica? What specific aspects of Christ's life did
   he highlight? Acts 17:2, 3.


   Christ the center of the message. Paul began his Thessalonian evan-
gelistic crusade by preaching the life of Christ. "Paul preached to the
Thessalonians, reasoning with them from the Scriptures regarding the life,
death, resurrection, officework, and future glory of Christ, the 'Lamb slain
from the foundation of the world.' Revelation 13:8. He exalted Christ, the
proper understanding of whose ministry is the key that unlocks the Old
Testament Scriptures, giving access to their rich treasures."—The Acts of
the Apostles, p. 229.

7. What was the customary emphasis in the preaching of the laity
   and leaders of the early church? Acts 5:42.


   Glorying in the cross. "The consecrated messengers who in the early
days of Christianity carried to a perishing world the glad tidings of salva-
tion, allowed no thought of self-exaltation to mar their presentation of
Christ and Him crucified. They coveted neither authority nor pre-
eminence. Hiding self in the Saviour, they exalted the great plan of salva-
tion, and the life of Christ, the Author and Finisher of this plan. Christ, the
same yesterday, today, and forever, was the burden of their teaching."—
The Acts of the Apostles, p. 209.


                                                                             9
       Lesson 1                                                         July 6
       8. What other important element of Bible truth was prominent in
          Paul's presentations? 1 Thess. 5:1, 2; 2 Thess. 2:3-5.


         Why did the Thessalonians "have no need" for Paul to write unto them
      regarding times and seasons? How did they know perfectly well that
      Christ's coming would be "like a thief in the night"? (1 Thess. 5:2, NIV).
      Because they already had been taught these things. The texts make it clear
      that while in Thessalonica Paul had carefully instructed his hearers regard-
      ing the prophecies of the first and second advents of Christ.
       9. Which prophetic message did Paul emphasize above all others?
          Acts 26:19-23.


          Preaching from the Old Testament. "Paul made the prophecies in the
      Old Testament relating to the Messiah, and the agreement of those proph-
      ecies with the life and teachings of Christ, clear in the minds of all among
      his hearers who would accept evidence upon the subject. Christ in His
      ministry had opened the minds of His disciples to the Old-Testament scrip-
      tures; 'beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in
      all the scriptures the things concerning himself.' "—Sketches From the
      Life of Paul, p. 82.
        Why must preaching on prophecy never diminish among Seventh-
      day Adventists? (See 1 Thess. 5:20; 2 Tim. 4:2.)

WED   IV. THE POWER OF PERSONAL TESTIMONY (1 Thess. 2:8).

      10. In appealing to the Thessalonian believers, how did Paul refer to
          his involvement in ministry? 1 Thess. 2:8.


         A story of Christ's transforming power. "Paul told the Thessalonian
      Jews of his former zeal for the ceremonial law and of his wonderful ex-
      perience at the gate of Damascus. Before his conversion he had been con-
      fident in a hereditary piety, a false hope. His faith had not been anchored
      in Christ; he had trusted instead in forms and ceremonies. His zeal for the
      law had been disconnected from faith in Christ and was of no avail. . . .
         "But at the time of his conversion all had been changed. Jesus of
      Nazareth, whom he had been persecuting in the person of His saints, ap-
      peared before him as the promised Messiah. The persecutor saw Him as
      the Son of God, the one who had come to the earth in fulfillment of the
      prophecies and who in His life had met every specification of the Sacred
      Writings."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 228.

      11. On what notable occasion did Paul later draw upon his personal ex-
          perience? With what dramatic result? Acts 25:22, 23; 26:1, 13-18,
          28.
      10
 Responding to the Divine Call                                      July 6
   Whether with peasants or potentates, Paul's testimony often included
his exciting encounter with Jesus on the Damascus road and the radical re-
versal of his life that resulted. King Herod Agrippa II was not the only
royal person to hear the story of Paul's conversion, but he appears to have
come the closest to conviction. Because Agrippa was a Jew, his conversion
to Christianity would have been a great triumph for the cause of God. It is
regrettable that he did not yield to the pleadings of the Spirit. Nevertheless,
given his background and status, it is remarkable that he was so deeply af-
fected by Paul's words and was willing to confess his feelings before Fes-
tus and his sister Bernice, as well as other dignitaries.

   What makes personal testimonies so powerful? What makes them
so effective?

V. OTHER PRINCIPLES FOR SOUL WINNERS (1 Thess. 1:1).

12. What important witnessing technique established by Christ is
    reflected in Paul's labors at Thessalonica? Mark 6:7; 1 Thess.
    1:1; 2 Thess. 1:1.



   Friend helping friend. "Calling the twelve about Him, Jesus bade
them go out two and two through the towns and villages. None were sent
forth alone, but brother was associated with brother, friend with friend.
Thus they could help and encourage each other, counseling and praying to-
gether, each one's strength supplementing the other's weakness. In the
same manner He afterward sent forth the seventy. It was the Saviour's pur-
pose that the messengers of the gospel should be associated in this way. In
our own time evangelistic work would be far more successful if this ex-
ample were more closely followed."—The Desire of Ages, p. 350.

13. For how long did Paul preach in the synagogue in Thessalonica?
    Acts 17:2.



   A short stay. Most Bible commentators see the total evidence of the
two Epistles to the Thessalonians, along with Acts chapter 17 and Philippi-
ans 4:16, as suggesting a stay of perhaps two or three months. Paul's stay
in Thessalonica was comparatively short. Not all of his evangelistic cam-
paigns were so brief. For instance, he labored in Corinth for 18 months
(Acts 18:11) and in Ephesus for three years (Acts 20:31): What the Thes-
salonian experience reveals is that there are times when circumstances
make possible abundant harvests from brief endeavors. Philip's "same
day" baptism of the Ethiopian illustrates the point. (See Acts 8:29-39.)

  Which is the greater danger, delaying the baptism of converts or
baptizing them too soon? How do we know when a person is ready for
baptism? Should we insist on a certain number of weeks or months for
preparation? What do you regard as a reasonable time?
                                                                             11
        Lesson 1                                                         July 6
      14. What two words best summarize Paul's balance of gospel en-
          deavors while at Thessalonica? 1 Thess. 2:2, 7.



         What a wonderful balance the apostle exercised. He was fearless and
      brave, yet kind and considerate; intrepid and firm, yet gentle and fair.
      Would it not be a wonderful thing if we labored today with the same
      balance, not only in our outreach to others but also in our association with
      one another? Bold but gentle! Think of what a difference such a combina-
      tion of graces would make for us today. How glorious the effect would be
      on our evangelism, in our homes, our institutions, and in our personal lives
      and witness!
      ASK YOURSELF:
        • Am I making a daily attempt to study the life of Christ? Am I able
          to tell the difference that such study makes on my attitudes and
          temperament?
        • What experiences—soul-winning or otherwise—have I had recently
          that prove the value of following biblical principles?
        • How do I explain that, even when I do everything God says, the
          results are not always what I expected?

FRI   FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION:
          What Jesus says on the heart of the gospel message: John 3:14-21;
      12:30-32; Matt. 28:18-20.
          What Paul says elsewhere: 2 Cor. 4:1-7; 5:14-21.
          What Ellen White says: "Lift Him up, the Man of Calvary, higher and
      still higher. There is power in the exaltation of the cross of Christ. . . .
          "Christ is to be preached, not controversially, but affirmatively. Take
      your stand without controversy. Let not your words at any time be uncer-
      tain. The Word of the living God is to be the foundation of our faith.
      Gather up the strongest affirmative statements regarding the atonement
      made by Christ for the sins of the world."—Evangelism, p. 187.
          "Of all professing Christians, Seventh-day Adventists should be fore-
      most in uplifting Christ before the world."—Gospel Workers, p. 156.
          Also read the chapter entitled "The Thessalonian Letters" in The Acts
      of the Apostles, pp. 255-268.
      SUMMARY: The biblical account of Paul's labors at Thessalonica reveals
      his faithful application of several vital principles of evangelism. By first
      listening to and obeying God's voice, Paul launched his career. He entered
      into a personal relationship with Christ, willingly receiving the presence of
      the Holy Spirit into his heart. Then by following God's counsel with re-
      spect to methodology, he maximized results.

   Results and Resistance
      at Thessalonica
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Acts 17:1-9; 1 Thessalonians 2:13, 14.

SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "And ye became followers of us, and of the
PM
      Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of
      the Holy Ghost" (1 Thessalonians 1:6).

VICTORY IN SPITE OF OBSTACLES. Satan does not yield his terri-
tory and subjects willingly. Since Eden, the preaching of the Word has in-
spired his fiercest hatred. However, in spite of determined opposition by
the enemies of the Christian cause, God's Word and people endure, and He
wins His case in the Great Controversy.

LESSON OUTLINE.
    I. The Word Bears Fruit (Acts 17:4).
   11. Preaching of the Word Brings Persecution (Acts 17:5;
        1 Thess. 2:15, 16).
  I11. The Believers' Response to Persecution (1 Thess. 1:6; 2:14;
        2 Thess. 1:4, 5).
  IV. The True Source of Persecution (Rev. 12:1-5).
   V. The Reasons for Persecution (Rev. 12:17).

GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS. While Timothy remained at Philippi
to follow up on the work that had been started there, Paul and Silas kept
busy at Thessalonica. Having just experienced bitter persecution in Phi-
lippi (Acts 16:22-40), Paul, no doubt, would have enjoyed a respite of
peace and tranquility in Thessalonica. This was not to be. The work in
Thessalonica turned out to be a case of good news and bad news. The good
news was that several important elements of the population yielded con-
verts who became charter members of the church there. The bad news was
that the majority of the populace either ignored or objected to Paul's mes-
sage. Having accused the evangelists of turning the world "upside down"
with their seditious gospel of a king other than Caesar (Acts 17:6, 7), they
brought legal charges against them and their brave host, Jason (Acts
17:8, 9).
    While Seventh-day Adventists in most of the world do not suffer the

   PRAY for theological books for our seminary libraries in Angola
   and Mozambique (US$1,000 each library).

                                                                         13

      same high level of hostility that Paul faced at Philippi, Thessalonica, and
      many other places, there are some who do. These members who live under
      intolerance and misunderstanding need our special prayers.
         Paul's example of steadfastness under trying circumstances is encourag-
      ing for those who suffer for the gospel's sake. It is also instructive for us
      who in the future may face similar ordeals.

SUN   I. THE WORD BEARS FRUIT (Acts 17:4).

      1. What people groups were most receptive to Paul's ministry? Acts
         17:4.



         The primary population groups of Thessalonica were Roman, Greek,
      and Jewish. The group that receives most prominent notice in Acts 17:4 is
      the Greeks. Luke calls them "devout" Greeks. He refers to those Greeks
      who already had replaced their mythical gods with the one true God. They
      were Greeks who, while refusing circumcision and resisting certain other
      legalistic demands of first-century Judaism, ardently read and believed Old
      Testament truths. This group formed the largest part of those who accepted
      Paul's teachings at Thessalonica, and in many of the other cities where he
      planted churches.

      2. How did those who responded to Paul's appeals demonstrate their
         sincerity? 1 Thess. 1:9.



         Thessalonica in Paul's day was a highly idolatrous city. Among the
      many false gods citizens worshiped were Zeus, Janus, and Hercules. The
      chief god, however, was the Greek god Jupiter, father of Hercules, thought
      to be the author of life. Since those who "turned to God from idols" were
      not Jews, they must have been unbelieving Gentiles. Because in their ac-
      count of the Thessalonian experience neither Luke nor Paul mentions
      Roman converts, these individuals probably were mainly Greeks.

         Which of these groups do you think can be most readily reached
      with biblical truth today: (a) atheists, who reject the idea of a superior
      being altogether, (b) non-Christians, such as Buddhists or Hindus, who
      worship deities other than Jehovah, (c) Jews who worship the Father
      but who do not believe in His Son, Jesus Christ, (d) Christians who do
      not believe as do Seventh-day Adventists? In what ways is it necessary
      to vary our approaches to these groups?

      3. What success did Paul have among the Jews to whom he
         preached? Acts 17:1-4.




      14
        Results and Resistance at Thessalonica                         July 13
          The "them" in the first part of verse 4 and the "them" in verse 2 refer
      to the Jews of the synagogue mentioned in verse 1. The gospel of Jesus
      Christ pierces all prejudices and traditions. The church must never abdicate
      its commission to work for the Jewish people. Even where Christians of
      past generations have created ill will because of their treatment of Jews,
      Christ-like love can overcome barriers.

         Many Jews will be converted. "There is a mighty work to be done in
      our world. The Lord has declared that the Gentiles shall be gathered in,
      and not the Gentiles only, but the Jews. There are among the Jews many
      who will be converted, and through whom we shall see the salvation of
      God go forth as a lamp that burneth. There are Jews everywhere, and to
      them the light of present truth is to be brought. There are among them
      many who will come to the light, and who will proclaim the immutability
      of the law of God with wonderful power. The Lord God will work. He will
      do wonderful things in righteousness."—Evangelism, p. 578.

         How would you share Christ with a Jewish associate or neighbor?
ION   4. What other special class of persons is noted as having accepted the
         Word? Acts 17:4.



         A similar statement by Luke regarding the results of Paul's labors in
      Berea (Acts 17:12) suggests that these were Greek women of high economic
      or social standing, perhaps wives of men who held leading positions in the
      city. Two reasons why women accepted the gospel in Thessalonica were:
      (1) The high degree of mobility and the people mix in Macedonia. The in-
      habitants of this province were restless, commercially-minded, and non-
      traditional. As such they were not as conservative in their social arrange-
      ments as were the more rural and less populated provinces around them. (2)
      Paul's emphasis on freedom in Christ. It is not strange that women in Thes-
      salonica and Berea followed him. His gospel emphasis was such that true
      liberation—social as well as spiritual—became a value to his hearers. In this
      sense Paul's preaching had a social impact that was radical for his day. Cer-
      tainly relationships between men and women were quite different from
      those that exist in some societies today. Even so, the gospel proclaimed by
      Paul elevated the status of women. Their personal spiritual union with Christ
      was as important as that of men, and men were instructed to love their wives
      as Christ loved the church (Eph. 5:25). Undoubtedly this was a radical
      departure from established custom for many men of that age.

         Can you think of other instances of social liberation resulting from
      Paul's preaching? What instances come to mind of social liberty
      brought about by Christ's personal example? How should the Adven-
      tist message "liberate" the social attitudes of converts in today's
      world?

11. PREACHING OF THE WORD BRINGS PERSECUTION (Acts
    17:5; 1 Thess. 2:15, 16).

5. Which group of persons does Luke mention as reacting violently
   against Paul? Acts 17:5.



   It is a tragic commentary upon God's professed children that they so
often persecute each other in His name. The animosity of the Jews toward
Paul provides an example of The great number of religious feuds that stain
the pages of history. Later there were other persecutions by professed
Christians—against Jews and against Christians who differed in their
beliefs. So-called religious warfare is most reprehensible. Particularly is it
sad when it is triggered by envy of another's witness for the meek and
lowly Jesus.

6. To what length did this group go in their attempt to silence the
   testimony of truth? Acts 17:5-9.



   The strategy is familiar. The opponents of truth secured the help of
baser witnesses; they stirred a mob to excited activity; they dragged Jason,
Paul's Christian host, and other believers before the civil authorities; they
accused them of crimes against Caesar. Here is an example of Satan's
usual method in the Great Controversy: force!

7. How does Paul describe the extent of Jewish hostility against the
   truth? 1 Thess. 2:15, 16.



  Why do you think opposition of the unbelieving Jews receives more
prominent mention than that of the idolatrous Gentiles?

I11. THE BELIEVERS' RESPONSE TO PERSECUTION (1 Thess.
     1:6; 2:14; 2 Thess. 1:4, 5).

8. At whose hands did the Gentile believers in Thessalonica also suf-
   fer? 1 Thess. 2:14.



   The apostle and his flock did not have an easy time at Thessalonica. Not
only did unbelieving Jews trouble them but they suffered at the hands of
the Gentile citizenry as well. Since almost 100 percent of the population of
Thessalonica (Saloniki) today profess some form of Christianity, they no
longer suffer at the hands of non-Christians. Unfortunately, however, ten-
sions among Christian groups are sometimes problematic.

      9. How does Paul later evaluate the church's quality of endurance
         under persecution? 1 Thess. 1:6; 2 Thess. 1:4, 5.



         The Thessalonians are a wonderful example of faithfulness under pain
      and suffering. For this Paul highly commended them on several occasions.
      Despised by the Jews and vilified by the Gentiles, nevertheless they were
      constant in their newly established devotion. Later, Paul evaluated the
      Bereans as being on the whole more studious than the people of Thessa-
      lonica (Acts 17:11). However, their endurance under persecution makes it
      evident that most of those who were baptized in Thessalonica were honest
      of heart and rooted in the Word of God.

         Where in the world today does persecution of Christian believers
      exist? How should we respond to it?

WED   IV. THE TRUE SOURCE OF PERSECUTION (Rev. 12:1-5).

      10. How does John the revelator portray both the beginning and the
          continuation of the controversy between Christ and Satan? Rev.
          12:1-5, 17.



         In Jeremiah 6:2, the prophet describes the church thus: "I have likened
      the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman." A woman often
      represents the church in biblical symbolism; the dragon represents Satan.

      11. Who is the man-child described in Revelation 12:5?



         "Satan wishes to destroy the child that is about to be born lest it should
      later destroy him. . . . But the Messiah is caught up to God and to His
      throne. In language adopted from Ps. 2:6 the Messiah is described as one
      destined to rule all nations with a rod of iron."—Charles M. Laymon,
      ed., The Interpreter's One-Volume Commentary on the Bible (New York:
      Abingdon Press, 1971), p. 960.

      12. What desperate effort did Satan make to abort the ministry of
          Jesus? Matt. 2:13, 14.



         Not just at His birth but all during His life, Jesus was the object of
      Satan's malignant animosity. Satan's singular determination was to thwart
      the plan of salvation and to revenge his ignominious defeat in heaven. He
      would have taken the life of Jesus much earlier had not the angels of God
      protected Him long enough for Calvary to become a reality. And it was not
      only physical oppression that Satan employed as a means of defeating
                                                                                17

Christ. He never relented in the psychological warfare by which he hoped
to overcome Him. Satan's purpose was to malign the character of God and
prevent Christ from saving His people from their sins.
   "Satan contested every inch of ground, exerting his utmost power to
overcome Him. Like a tempest temptation after temptation beat upon
Him."—Signs of the Times, Aug. 27, 1902.

   Why does religious prejudice develop into active, hostile acts of per-
secution?

V. THE REASONS FOR PERSECUTION (Rev. 12:17).

13. After Jesus was "caught up" to God's throne (Rev. 12:5), against
    whom would Satan vent his wrath? Rev. 12:13, 17.



   History will be repeated. The kind of suffering inflicted upon Paul and
the Thessalonian believers may be suffered in some degree by any person
who claims the name of Jesus.
   Several years ago in a large city in the United States a citizen sued a
church group because he was injured by a falling tree limb while walking
a city street. The reason he sued the church? He was told that the dislodg-
ing of the limb was an "act of God." He could not, he reasoned, sue God,
so he acted against His visible representatives. He lost the case—and so
will Satan, whose head is already bruised (Gen. 3:15). In the meantime he
seeks to wreak havoc on God's people.

14. What fundamental principles of Christianity are especially offen-
    sive to the dragon? John 15:12-14; Eph. 5:2.



   Satan hates sacrifice. "All who follow Christ will wear the crown of
sacrifice. They will surely be misunderstood by selfish men, and will be
made a mark for the fierce assaults of Satan. It is this principle of self-
sacrifice that his kingdom is established to destroy, and he will war against
it wherever manifested."—The Desire of Ages, p. 223.

    In the light of the above quotation, what would seem to be the case
if the people of God are living in happy favor with society? Is rejection
inevitable for those who live right and who preach Jesus Christ? Is
martyrdom inevitable? What is the difference between redemptive
and nonredemptive suffering?

15. Against what particularly unseemly form of persecution does
    Jesus warn? Matt. 24:48-50.



     A sure way to failure. "It is not the opposition of the world that most
18
       Results and Resistance at Thessalonica                          July 13
      endangers the church of Christ. It is the evil cherished in the hearts of
      believers that works their most grievous disaster and most surely retards
      the progress of God's cause. There is no surer way of weakening spiritual-
      ity than by cherishing envy, suspicion, faultfinding, and evil surmis-
      ing."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 549.
          "In the place of turning the weapons of warfare within our own ranks,
      let them be turned against the enemies of God and of the truth." Selected
      Messages, book 3, p. 18. (This statement is not intended to legitimize per-
      secuting others who differ from us.)

      ASK YOURSELF:
        • Can I honestly say that I have suffered for the gospel's sake? If so,
          in what ways?
        • Should I feel good while suffering because of doing right? If so,
          why? If not, why not?
        • What kinds of persecution do I find the most difficult or unpleasant?
        • What are the levels of persecution that I am prepared to suffer in
          defense of my faith?
                       Loss of job                 Loss of friends
                       Loss of spouse              Family rejection
                       Loss of life
        • What act of Christ more than any other inspires and strengthens my
          ability to withstand persecution?
        • What causes opposition to the Adventist message in your local com-
          munity today? How should the church respond to it?

FRI   FURTHER READING AND MEDITATION:
         What Jesus says about persecution: Matt. 16:21-28; John 15:18-25.
         What Paul says elsewhere: Rom. 8:35-39; 2 Cor. 4:8-18.
         What Ellen White says: "The same enmity is manifested toward
      Christ's followers as was manifested toward their Master. Whoever sees
      the repulsive character of sin, and in strength from above resists tempta-
      tion, will assuredly arouse the wrath of Satan and his subjects. Hatred of
      the pure principles of truth, and reproach and persecution of its advocates,
      will exist as long as sin and sinners remain. The followers of Christ and the
      servants of Satan cannot harmonize."—The Great Controversy, p. 507.

      SUMMARY: As Paul preached at Thessalonica he encountered both re-
      ceptive people and bitter opponents. However, the actions of Christ's en-
      emies did not prevent a rich and rewarding harvest. Although Paul had to
      escape for his life, it was not before he had firmly planted the cross of
      Christ in a most strategic location.

       The Epistles Are Born
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Acts 17:10-21; 18:1-5, 11; 1 Thessalonians
3:1-13; 2 Thessalonians 1:1-3.
SAB    MEMORY TEXT: "For this cause, when I could no longer for-
PM
       bear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter
       have tempted you, and our labour be in vain" (1 Thessalonians
       3:5).

NURTURE OF NEW CONVERTS. Paul's tender concern for the young
church at Thessalonica is an example of the relationship that should exist
between pastor and people. It is a worthy model for the efforts of modern-
day soul winners to nurture those who come to Christ.

LESSON OUTLINE:
    I. Paul Leaves Thessalonica (Acts 17:10-14).
   11. Paul Leaves Berea (Acts 17:13-22, 32, 33).
  I11. From Athens to Corinth (Acts 18:1-8, 11).
  IV. Timothy's Report From Thessalonica (1 Thess. 1:2, 3; 3:1-6).
   V. The Epistles Are Born (1 Thess. 1:1; 3:7-9; 5:27).

PAUL'S LAWFUL BIAS. The great evangelist, Paul, might rightfully be
accused of preferential regard for those whom he had won to Christ. He
never relinquished the special pastoral ties that he had established with his
converts. One of Paul's more memorable characterizations of the bond be-
tween soul winner and convert is the parent-child relationship. (See
1 Thess. 2:11.) The New Testament Epistles that Paul penned to churches
for which he labored are evidence that this fatherly affection concerned not
only baptizing but also stabilizing his converts in Christ.
   Paul had a pastor's heart. He would much rather have visited the new
believers than write to them. He longed to sit with them face to face, to
share individually in their sorrows and joys and to rejoice in the excitement
of their growth. But travel in his day was extremely difficult compared to
today's standards. Sometimes Paul never saw his converts again. This is
why his letters were so important to them and to him—they were the very
best he could do.

 The Epistles Are Born                                            July 20
   Through his letters Paul sought to communicate not only his loving
concern but also needed instruction regarding doctrine, personal piety,
interpersonal relationships, church order and organization, the ministry of
the laity, and any other topic that he knew was vital to their spiritual sur-
vival. He often had to accomplish this under trying circumstances. The
conditions that occasioned the Thessalonian letters are typical of Paul's ex-
perience and quite clearly reveal the shepherd's heart of the great apostle
and the love of God in sending him to minister.

I. PAUL LEAVES THESSALONICA (Acts 17:10-14).

   Because of the unrest in Thessalonica, the believers secretly sent Paul
and Silas to Berea (Acts 17:10). Berea is a much smaller city than Thes-
salonica. It is inland, not coastal. The population is thought to have been
approximately 50,000 in Paul's day and is about half that today. The mod-
ern name of the city is Verroia. In order to reach Berea, Paul had to travel
50 miles, at least a two-day journey.

1. How did the response at Berea compare with the one in Thes-
   salonica? In what way does the Berean response inform and in-
   struct hearers today? Acts 17:11. Can you think of a person in
   your congregation who had a similar response?



   "More noble" here means more generous in spirit, more open-minded.
We cannot assume from Luke's observation that there were more people
baptized at Berea, but simply that the level or quality of response was more
intense and that there was less opposition to the gospel.

   The value of personal investigation. "Wherever the truths of the
gospel are proclaimed, those who honestly desire to do right are led to a
diligent searching of the Scriptures. If, in the closing scenes of this earth's
history, those to whom testing truths are proclaimed would follow the ex-
ample of the Bereans, searching the Scriptures daily, and comparing with
God's word the messages brought them, there would today be a large num-
ber loyal to the precepts of God's law, where now there are comparatively
few. But when unpopular Bible truths are presented, many refuse to make
this investigation. Though unable to controvert the plain teachings of
Scripture, they yet manifest the utmost reluctance to study the evidences
offered. Some assume that even if these doctrines are indeed true, it mat-
ters little whether or not they accept the new light, and they cling to pleas-
ing fables which the enemy uses to lead souls astray. Thus their minds are
blinded by error, and they become separated from heaven."—The Acts of
the Apostles, p. 232.

    How can we awaken interest in Bible study among the unchurched
in our local community? What are some of the social and demographic
realities that might impact upon a people's response to the gospel? Is
it right to evaluate evangelistic results strictly in terms of numbers
baptized? Why?
                                                                    21

H. PAUL LEAVES BEREA (Acts 17:13-22, 32, 33).

2. Why did Paul leave Berea and with what consequences to the
   Thessalonian believers? Acts 17:13, 14.



   A change in plans. The Jews of Thessalonica who had rejected Paul's
message followed him to Berea and stirred up the opposition of the lower
class. Because the believers in Berea were afraid for Paul's life, they sent
him to Athens. Paul had hoped to go back to Thessalonica and pay a pas-
toral visit to the new believers there. Now this was impossible. (See The
Acts of the Apostles, pp. 232, 233.)
   Paul did as Jesus had advised in such situations: "If anyone will not
welcome you or listen to your words, shake the dust off your feet when
you leave that home or town" (Matt. 10:14, NIV).

  In what situations today would you apply Jesus' counsel? Why is it
sometimes wiser to leave people in their unbelief than to attempt to
combat their hostility?

3. Where did Paul go when he left Berea? Acts 17:15.



   Athens was the home of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle; it was the undis-
puted queen of Grecian art, poetry, and philosophy. It was described by
Aristophanes as "our Athens, violet-wreathed, brilliant, most envious
city." Athens represents, as no other ancient city does, "the glory that was
Greece." It is located approximately 200 miles south of Thessalonica and
was in Paul's day the undisputed intellectual center of the world.

4. How did Paul approach the Athenians? What can we learn about
   our approach to large, secular cities today? Acts 17:18-22.



    On Mars' Hill. Paul's hearers in Athens recognized his learning and
admired his eloquence. His years of training at the feet of Gamaliel (Acts
22:3) paid off in this situation. Paul's rabbinic education rendered him able
to argue his case with devastating logic. His knowledge of philosophy and
literature enabled him to meet the scholars of Athens on their own ground.
Mars' Hill or the Areopagus was the seat of the ancient Athenian court that
judged certain crimes and religious offenses. This court also had the power
to license teachers and control education in Athens.
    How significant that Hebrew-Christian thought should thus meet Greek
philosophical thought head-on at this great center of learning. Paul quickly
discovered what many philosophers and theologians have never recog-
nized, that Greek philosophy is basically antagonistic to the Hebrew-
Christian tradition.

22
      The Epistles Are Born                                          July 20
    5. What important lesson can we learn from Paul's ministry on
       Mars' Hill? How can I apply this lesson to my own daily witness to
       unchurched friends, relatives, neighbors, and co-workers?

       Speaking the truth in love. "Paul's words contain a treasure of knowl-
    edge for the church. He was in a position where he might easily have said
    that which would have irritated his proud listeners and brought himself
    into difficulty. Had his oration been a direct attack upon their gods and the
    great men of the city, he would have been in danger of meeting the fate of
    Socrates. But with a tact born of divine love, he carefully drew their minds
    away from heathen deities, by revealing to them the true God, who was to
    them unknown."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 241.

    6. What were the results of Paul's witness at Athens? Acts 17:32-34.



       Athens compared to other major cities. The Bible does not indicate
    how long Paul worked in Athens or whether he returned there at a sub-
    sequent time. It is interesting to compare the response to the gospel by the
    less sophisticated Thessalonians and Corinthians with the response of the
    philosophically trained Athenians.

       Paul's labor in Athens not entirely in vain. "The labors of Paul in
    Athens were not wholly in vain. Dionysus, one of the most prominent citi-
    zens, and some others, became converts to Christianity, and joined them-
    selves to him. The words of the apostle, and the description of his attitude
    and surroundings, as traced by the pen of inspiration, were to be handed
    down through all coming generations, bearing witness of his unshaken
    confidence, his courage in loneliness and adversity, and the victory he
    gained for Christianity, even in the very heart of paganism."—Sketches
    From the Life of Paul, pp. 96, 97.

       Why do the less educated sometimes respond more gladly to the
    gospel? How can we learn to be more effective in winning to Christ the
    educated and affluent?

     I11. FROM ATHENS TO CORINTH (Acts 18:1-8, 11).
IIII 7. Where did Paul go from Athens? Acts 18:1.

        Athens was the diadem of intellectual culture in Paul's day, but Corinth
     was the titan of commerce, trade, and military power. And, like most large
     seaport centers of commerce, it was a wicked city. Its devotion to the
     goddess Aphrodite encouraged prostitution and sensuous revelry.

     8. Thinking that his philosophical defense of Christianity on Mars'
        Hill was not very productive, what was Paul's singular determina-
        tion upon reaching Corinth? 1 Cor. 2:1, 2.
                                                                               23
        Lesson 3                                                       July 20
         Positive, Christ-centered preaching. At Athens Paul had departed
      from his usual pattern of gospel preaching. He tried to meet the educated,
      argumentative Greeks on their own ground in their own terms. (See The
      Acts of the Apostles, p. 244.) Although he called upon the name of Jesus,
      and his efforts were not altogether futile, he was not satisfied, but was de-
      termined from then on to preach only Jesus—that is, to ground his mes-
      sages in no other material or discipline than the Word of God.

       9. What were the happy results of Paul's preaching in Corinth?
          How long did he labor there? Acts 18:1-8, 11.



        Is your local community more like Athens or Corinth? How would
      Paul have approached it?

WED   IV. TIMOTHY'S REPORT FROM THESSALONICA (1 Thess. 1:2,
          3; 3:1-6).

      10. Even though he was busy establishing God's work in other
          places, what had been Paul's daily habit with respect to the newly
          baptized in Thessalonica? 1 Thess. 1:2, 3.



      11. Who was sent by Paul to visit the Thessalonians? What was his
          primary goal? 1 Thess. 3:1-5.



          The importance of spiritual nurture. The apostle longed to see the
      newly formed congregation. His brief stay among the Thessalonians, his
      abrupt departure, and his shepherd's sense of their need for instruction and
      encouragement weighed heavily upon his mind. Time, distance, and the
      hostility of enemies frustrated his desires in this regard. Since, as he ex-
      pressed, Satan had "again and again" hindered his plans of returning to
      Thessalonica (1 Thess. 2:18, Amplified Version), Paul did the next best
      thing—he sent his spiritual son, Timothy, to encourage and instruct the
      new believers. And he was wise in doing so, for "transplanting is easy, but
      rooting takes time." That sentiment summarizes an essential part of soul
      winning. Paul understood this principle and applied it faithfully in relating
      to the Thessalonians.

         Are there recently baptized members in your local church congre-
      gation? Does your church have planned activities for stabilizing recent
      converts? What activities would you suggest?

      12. What report did Timothy bring back to Paul? 1 Thess. 3:6.

   As is usually the case, converts and teacher longed to see each other.
The soul winner is grateful, gratified by the sight or even remembrance of
those whose lives he or she has been used to win. And the converts also are
grateful. While primarily debtors to Christ, they also feel beholden to the
individual whom God used to bring them the truth.
   Pastors and lay workers testify to the bond that they enjoy with those
whom they have been able to lead to the Lord. The mutual joy, the shared
memories, and gratitude of the believers in some ways rival the intensity of
the bonds shared with immediate family members.

V. THE EPISTLES ARE BORN (1 Thess. 3:7-9; 1:1; 5:27).

13. How did Paul react to the good news that Timothy delivered?
    1 Thess. 3:7-9.



  The good report does not elicit boasting or self-congratulation. Paul
understood that the effectiveness seen at Thessalonica was the work of the
Holy Spirit, not his genius. Thus, he gave the glory and credit to God and
wished to make an adequate response (thanksgiving) to God. He did not
say what he would render, but his dedicated witness from city to city
makes it clear that he saw a life totally committed to God's bidding as the
only adequate response to His blessings. (See Rom. 12:1.)

   Have you had the pleasure of leading a person or persons to Christ?
How do you describe the feeling of seeing them still faithful years
later? Describe your emotions when such a one leaves the church.
What parallels can you draw between your attitude toward those who
leave the church and Jesus' love for us?

   Paul's grateful response. "Delighted at the good news which Timothy
had brought back, Paul took up his pen and wrote to the community; the
result is our 1 Thess., the oldest surviving Pauline Epistle. It was written in
the early months of his sojourn at Corinth, probably at the beginning of 52
A.D."—Alfred Wikenhauser, New Testament Introduction, p. 364.
   Internal evidence suggests that 2 Thessalonians was written within a pe-
riod of weeks or months of 1 Thessalonians and that both were written
from Corinth, not Athens, as suggested by the translators' footnotes at the
end of each book. The two letters differ considerably in tone, but slightly
in content. There is little in either of the Thessalonian Epistles that fits
Peter's charge that some of Paul's writings are hard to understand. (See
2 Peter 3:16.) The thrust of the letters to the Thessalonian church involves
simple, practical, Christian counsel.

14. With what earnest appeal to fidelity does Paul undergird the
    message of both Epistles? 1 Thess. 5:21; 2 Thess. 2:15.




                                                                            25

      PERSONAL CONSIDERATIONS:
        • Do you sense special emotional ties with the minister who baptized
          you? Is this wrong? How do you feel about these ties?
        • Do you sometimes make negative comparisons of pastors? If so, is
          this right? How can a partisan spirit be avoided or overcome? (See
          1 Cor. 3:21-23; The Acts of the Apostles, p. 280.)
        • Name several ways in which you can express proper appreciation
          for an evangelist or pastor.
        • What way or ways can you think of to respond to the gifts of Christ,
          the chief Shepherd? (1 Peter 5:14).

FRI   FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION:
         What Jesus says about spiritual shepherding: John 10:7-14; 21:15-17.
         What Paul says elsewhere: 1 Cor. 3:1-23.
         What Ellen White says: "Preaching is a small part of the work to be
      done for the salvation of souls. God's Spirit convicts sinners of the truth,
      and He places them in the arms of the church. The ministers may do their
      part, but they can never perform the work that the church should do. God
      requires His church to nurse those who are young in faith and experience,
      to go to them, not for the purpose of gossiping with them, but to pray, to
      speak unto them words that are 'like apples of gold in pictures of
      silver.' "—Evangelism, p. 352.

      SUMMARY: Paul's triumphs and trials in new cities did not diminish his
      concern for those whom he had left behind. He often was hindered from
      seeing the believers again, but through his letters he was able to sustain his
      relationships and facilitate their growth in the grace of the Lord Jesus
      Christ.



                          The Water Of Life
           The gospel of Christ is the water of life,
             And this water of life is free;
           But it costs for the plumbing and all of the pipes
             To bring it to you and to me.

      The Gospel Identified
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Thessalonians 1:1-10; 2:1-9; Revelation
14:6-12.
SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "But as we were allowed of God to be put in
PM
      trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but
      God, which trieth our hearts" (1 Thessalonians 2:4).

GOSPEL ROOTS. The 27 fundamental beliefs that Seventh-day Adven-
tists espouse today are rooted in the rich mines of truth that Paul explores
throughout the Epistles to the Thessalonians. His view of how the Persons
of the Godhead work to save human beings is central to gospel under-
standing and provides an example for our witness today.

LESSON OUTLINE:
    I. Paul's Gospel Emphasis (1 Thess. 1:5, 6).
   11. God the Father and the Gospel (1 Thess. 1:9, 10).
  I11. God the Son and the Gospel (1 Thess. 1:10).
  IV. The Holy Spirit and the Gospel (1 Thess. 1:5).
   V. The Gospel and the Remnant Church (Rev. 14:6-12).

THE CENTRALITY OF THE GOSPEL. First Thessalonians consists
primarily of general admonitions and expressions of gratitude. It does not
have the deep theological veins contained in Romans, Galatians, or some
other letters. The emphasis in this book is on practical godliness. Neverthe-
less, there are fundamental doctrinal teachings intermingled with pastoral
counsel. We shall identify and study the more important of these during
the following weeks.
    This week we begin by examining the foundation upon which the apos-
tle structured his approach, not only to the Thessalonians but also to all of
the churches for whom he labored. This approach shaped his messages
while laboring for their conversion and shaped the Epistles he later wrote
to encourage their continuance in the faith. The dynamic, soul-winning,
soul-conserving principle basic to Paul's ministry was the gospel itself.

more fully the truth that for ages past had been presented in prophecy and
symbol?
I. PAUL'S GOSPEL EMPHASIS (1 Thess. 1:5, 6).

1. While Paul begins his correspondence by labeling his preaching as
   "our gospel" (1 Thess. 1:5), in what clear terms does he identify
   the true source of his message?

     1 Thess. 2:2
     1 Thess. 2:8

     1 Thess. 2:9
     1 Thess. 3:2

     2 Thess. 1:8
   A divine mission of rescue. Throughout his long and fruitful ministry,
Paul conducted himself as a representative of God to His lost family on
earth. What message did he communicate? It was the good news of human
rescue by the Deity. Through incomprehensible pain and sacrifice, God the
Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit have provided the means for
salvation of doomed humanity. Existence for worldlings need not end in
extinction. Heavenly forces have found a way out of sin, degradation, and
eternal death. That is the essence of Paul's message—salvation provided
by a sovereign God for His lost creation.

    Not a human discovery. "It should not be forgotten that the gospel
came to the Thessalonians. It had to—or they would never have known it.
It does not arise from within the heart of man. It is not human nature and
it is not human discovery. God sent his Son; that is, he came from outside
history into history and he still has to be proclaimed."—Ronald A. Ward,
Commentary on 1 & 2 Thessalonians (Waco, Tex.: Word Books, 1973),
p. 34.
11. GOD THE FATHER AND THE GOSPEL (1 Thess. 1:9, 10).

2. How does Paul state the involvement of God the Father with the
   gospel?
     1 Thess. 1:9, 10

     1 Thess. 2:12

     1 Thess. 4:14

     1 Thess. 5:9

     1 Thess. 5:23

        The Gospel Identified                                            July 27
         The Father suffered with the Son. God the Father is an equally active
      participant, involved not only in the "handshake," or agreement, that
      launched Jesus on His way but in devising the means whereby His Son
      was able to become our substitute and surety, and in suffering vicariously
      the agony of Christ's life and death. (See The Desire of Ages, p. 693.)

      3. What clear outline of the Father's relationship to Christ's ministry
         is given in the book of Hebrews? Heb. 1:1-3.



         "Had God the Father come to our world and dwelt among us, humbling
      Himself, veiling His glory, that humanity might look upon Him, the history
      that we have of the life of Christ would not have been changed. . . . In
      every act of Jesus, in every lesson of His instruction, we are to see and
      hear and recognize God. In sight, in hearing, in effect, it is the voice and
      movements of the Father."—That I May Know Him, p. 338.

        How many specific incidents in the life of Jesus can you think of in
      which the Father and the Son interacted directly?

MON   I11. GOD THE SON AND THE GOSPEL (1 Thess. 1:10).

      4. What does Paul tell us about the involvement of God the Son with
         the gospel?

         1 Thess. 2:15

         1 Thess. 3:12, 13

         1 Thess. 4:16, 17

         1 Thess. 5:9, 10

      5. On what events in the ministry of Jesus does Paul place particular
         emphasis? 1 Thess. 1:10; 1 Cor. 15:3, 4, 17.



         A comprehensive gospel. The gospel Paul preached to the Thessaloni-
      ans emphasized the death, resurrection, and second coming of Jesus Christ.
      These truths are central to the gospel. Christ's death atoned for our sin; His
      resurrection makes possible His mediation for our sin as well as the resur-
      rection, at His second advent, of those who died believing in Him.

         The centrality of the cross. "The sacrifice of Christ as an atonement
      for sin is the great truth around which all other truths cluster. In order to be
      rightly understood and appreciated, every truth in the Word of God, from
      Genesis to Revelation, must be studied in the light that streams from the
      cross of Calvary."—Evangelism, p. 190.

                                                                                   29

    Christ's resurrection essential to our salvation. To the Corinthians
Paul wrote: "And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and
your faith is also vain" (1 Cor. 15:14). Paul presented the resurrection as
the divine proof of the Sonship of Christ. Christ rose from the grave in ful-
fillment of His promise (Matt. 12:40; John 2:19-21). It is also essential
truth that He arose by His own power. Jesus said of His life, "I have power
to lay it down, and I have power to take it again" (John 10:18). The
powers of response were resident within the sleeping form.
    "He who had said, 'I lay down my life, that I might take it again' (John
10:17), came forth from the grave to life that was in Himself. Humanity
died; divinity did not die. In His divinity, Christ possessed the power to
break the bonds of death. He declares that He has life in Himself to
quicken whom He will."—Selected Messages, book 1, p. 301.
    "All that comprised the life and intelligence of Jesus remained with His
body in the sepulchre; and when He came forth it was as a whole being;
He did not have to summon His spirit from heaven."—Ellen G. White
Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1151.

6. In addressing the church of Rome what clarion witness sum-
   marized Paul's attitude toward the gospel of Christ? Romans 1:16.



    "The second Tor' gives the reason for Paul's boldness: this good news
concerning Christ's death, burial, resurrection, and appearing, 'is the
power of God unto salvation unto every one that believeth.' There is no
fact for a preacher or teacher to hold more constantly in his mind than this.
It is not the 'excellency of speech or wisdom,' or the 'personal mag-
netism,' or 'earnestness,' of the preacher; any more than it is the deep re-
pentance or earnest prayers of the hearer, that avails. But it is the message
of Christ crucified, dead, buried, and risen, which, being believed, is 'the
power of God'!"—William R. Newell, Romans Verse by Verse (Chicago:
Moody Press, 1940), p. 19.

IV. THE HOLY SPIRIT AND THE GOSPEL (1 Thess. 1:5).

7. What medium of communication is especially essential for the
   transmission of the gospel? 1 Thess. 1:5.



   The Bible teaches that spiritual matters are spiritually discerned (see
1 Cor. 2:14). The Holy Spirit imparts this ability to discern truth (see
1 Cor. 2:13; John 16:13.) That the Holy Spirit is willing and able to do this
with human will and mentality is a powerful testimony to both the love and
the power of the cooperating Persons of the Deity.

8. What influence did the Holy Spirit have on the lives of the Thes-
   salonians? 1 Thess. 1:6.


30
        The Gospel Identified                                          July 27
         Life's highest joy. Is there any experience more exhilarating, more
      thrilling, more satisfying than conversion? Can not all of us testify that
      being wooed and won by the Holy Spirit, being freed of confusion, dark-
      ness, and fears of sin, and being grounded in the knowledge, love, and
      faith of Jesus is life's highest joy? There is no more satisfying realization
      than that of knowing that we are loved, valued, treasured, redeemed by
      Christ; that there is hope beyond the grave, that life does have meaning,
      that God's principles and promises are true, that Jesus lives eternally, and
      that He is mine! And there is no more fulfilling experience than commun-
      ion with Him through the agency of the Holy Spirit.

WED    9. What practical, everyday function, also critical to the gospel
          process, does the Holy Spirit conduct? 1 Thess. 4:7, 8; 1 Peter
          1:2, 22.



         In addition to enlightenment and joy the Holy Spirit brings cleansing
      and transformation of heart. There are those who seek knowledge and hap-
      piness without pursuing holiness. Their attempt ignores one of the Spirit's
      primary functions—that of. regeneration and reconciliation. The Holy
      Spirit wrought miraculous changes in the lives of the Thessalonians and, if
      permitted, will do the same for church members today.

      10. Given the importance of the Holy Spirit to the success of the
          gospel program, what should be the church's earnest endeavor?
          Zech. 10:1.



         The promise of "added power." "But near the close of earth's
      harvest, a special bestowal of spiritual grace is promised to prepare the
      church for the coming of the Son of man. This outpouring of the Spirit is
      likened to the falling of the latter rain; and it is for this added power that
      Christians are to send their petitions to the Lord of the harvest 'in the time
      of the latter rain.' In response, 'the Lord shall make bright clouds, and give
      them showers of rain.' He will cause to come down . . . the rain, the
      former rain, and the latter rain.' "—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 55.

      V. THE GOSPEL AND THE REMNANT CHURCH (Rev. 14:6-12).

      11. Compare the gospel that Paul preached and the one that we
          preach today. Rev. 14:6.



         Why is the gospel that the remnant preach called everlasting? Be-
      cause its wonders never cease, its beauties never fade, its promises never
      fail, and its principles never falter. It is today and it will be tomorrow and
      beyond that, if time should last, as relevant, as exciting, as redemptive, as
      when Adam heard it outside the gates of Eden, or as when Moses saw it on
                                                                                 31
  Lesson 4                                                        July 27
Mount Nebo, or Abraham viewed it in Haran, or the disciples touched and
handled it in Palestine, or Paul dispensed it throughout his missionary jour-
neys. It is everlasting because it transcends time. Born in the precouncils of
eternity, it was here before our clocks began, and it will be here when time
shall be no more. As unending eternity rolls we shall study its details at the
feet of Jesus.

12. While the gospel preached by the remnant is the same as that an-
    nounced in Genesis 3:15 and that preached by Paul at Thes-
    salonica, what special features are to be emphasized at this time
    in history? Rev. 14:6-12.



   Especially for our day. "The message of salvation has been preached
in all ages; but this message [of the three angels] is a part of the gospel
which could be proclaimed only in the last days, for only then would it be
true that the hour of judgment had come. The prophecies present a succes-
sion of events leading down to the opening of the judgment. This is espe-
cially true of the book of Daniel. But that part of his prophecy which re-
lated to the last days, Daniel was bidden to close up and seal 'to the time
of the end.' Not till we reach this time could a message concerning the
judgment be proclaimed, based on a fulfillment of these prophecies."—
The Great Controversy, p. 356.

  Name at least four of the special reforms that are a part of the three
angels' messages as recorded in Revelation 14.

13. What other agencies, in addition to the Persons of the Deity, have
    a vital part in the gospel program? Heb. 1:13, 14; Mark 16:15,
    16.



   God's helpers. "The work of preaching the gospel has not been com-
mitted to angels, but has been entrusted to men. Holy angels have been
employed in directing this work, they have in charge the great movements
for the salvation of men; but the actual proclamation of the gospel is per-
formed by the servants of Christ upon the earth."—The Great Con-
troversy, p. 312.

14. What mission followed and commanded by Jesus are we to fulfill
    in cooperation with God's saving work? Matt. 28:19.



   Accepting the gospel. "Those who are baptized in the threefold name
of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, at the very entrance of their
Christian life declare publicly that they have forsaken the service of Satan,
and have become members of the royal family, children of the heavenly
King."—Evangelism, p. 307.

          rain" power. True / / False / /
        • The primary obstacle to "latter rain" power in the church is the in-
          adequacy of the church organization. True / / False / /
        • My own life is such that I can be a recipient of the latter rain.
          True / / False / /
        • The primary meaning of baptism is affiliation with Christ and not
          with His representative organization, the church. True / / False / /

FRI   FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION:
         What Jesus says about the work of the Persons of the Deity: John 5:17-
      30; 6:35-40; 10:17-30; 16:7-11.
         What Paul says elsewhere: Rom. 1:1-17; Eph. 3:16-19.
         What Ellen White says: "The first disciples went forth preaching the
      word. . . . Before the day of Pentecost they met together, and put away all
      differences. They were of one accord. They believed Christ's promise that
      the blessing would be given, and they prayed in faith. They did not ask for
      a blessing for themselves merely; they were weighted with the burden for
      the salvation of souls. The gospel was to be carried to the uttermost parts
      of the earth, and they claimed the endowment of the power that Christ had
      promised. Then it was that the Holy Spirit was poured out, and thousands
      were converted in a day.
          "So it may be now. Instead of man's speculations, let the word of God
      be preached. Let Christians put away their dissensions, and give them-
      selves to God for the saving of the lost. Let them in faith ask for the bless-
      ing, and it will come. The outpouring of the Spirit in apostolic days was
      the 'former rain,' and glorious was the result. But the 'latter rain' will be
      more abundant."—The Desire of Ages, p. 827.
          Also read the chapter entitled "Go Teach All Nations," in The Desire
      of Ages, pp. 818-828.

      SUMMARY: Paul's concept of the gospel includes the dramatic and full
      participation of each Person of the Godhead. This view, firmly developed
      in 1 Thessalonians, undergirds Paul's faith, shapes his theology, and in-
      spires his zeal. Clearly understood and appreciated, it will have the same
      effect upon modern believers as upon Paul and those who first read his
      message.




                                                                                 33

          The Gospel and the
               Kingdom
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Thessalonians 2:10-14; Hebrews 4:15, 16.

SAB    MEMORY TEXT: "As ye know how we exhorted and com-
PM
       forted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his
       children, that ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you
       unto his kingdom and glory" (1 Thessalonians 2:11, 12).

MORE THAN GOOD NEWS. The gospel not only contains good news
about God; it also is our call to a new existence, one that includes special
affiliation and identification. The gospel calls us out of sin's slavery into
the light and the fellowship of Christ and His people. Properly understood,
it is not simply the report of rescue, about which we read; it also is an act
of redemption, which we experience.

   11. The Kingdoms Distinguished (Matt. 4:17; 25:31-34).
 I11. Jesus and the Kingdom (Matt. 24:14).
  IV. Kingdom Membership (1 Thess. 1:4).
   V. The Kingdom Extended (1 Thess 1:6, 8).

CITIZENS OF THE KINGDOM. The truth of the kingdom that Paul links
with the gospel has critical implications for our spiritual understanding.
However, because there are few kingdoms or even quasi-kingdoms left in
the world, people today have little appreciation for what they were like in
Christ's day. Kingdoms were political strongholds in which monarchs ruled
their subjects and territories with complete control. They were military
domains in which all inhabitants belonged to the ruler. The citizens' most
essential task was to bring glory and honor to the throne.
   The kingdom of God's Son. Paul identifies for us the most basic of our
Christian affiliations—the invisible kingdom of God (1 Thess. 2:12). Its
provisions are similar in some respects to those of the ancient realm. As we
study this week's lesson we will see that, while Paul is categorically com-
mitted to the authority of the visible church, he is very positive with re-
spect to our primary citizenship in the unseen or invisible kingdom of God.

  This concept of a present spiritual kingdom is absolutely crucial to
Paul's total surrender to the will of Christ. For him, the kingdom model
dominates. He sees himself as one rescued from Satan's kingdom, or "the
power of darkness," and taken or delivered "into the kingdom of his
[God's] dear Son" (Col. 1:13).

I. THE KINGDOM IDENTIFIED (1 Thess. 2:12).

1. What is the relationship between the two privileges to which the
   Thessalonians were called? 1 Thess. 2:12.



   The sequence is instructive—kingdom and glory. Here Paul speaks of a
present kingdom and glory which prepare us for the future kingdom and
glory. The glory of the character of Christ given us now when we believe
(John 17:22) is the qualification for the entry into the glorious kingdom
that Christ will establish at His second advent.

2. What else are we told regarding the nature of the present
   kingdom? Heb. 4:14-16.



   Thrones represent kingdoms. The "throne of grace" (Heb. 4:16) is
symbolic of the kingdom of grace over which Christ reigns now. "Unto
the Son he saith, Thy throne, 0 God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of
righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom" (Heb. 1:8). His subjects in
heaven and earth acknowledge His present rulership. (See Phil. 2:9-11.)

   Satan knew. "He knew, through prophecy, that a Saviour was pre-
dicted, and that His kingdom would not be established in earthly triumph
and with worldly honor and display. He knew that the prophecies foretold
a kingdom to be established by the Prince of heaven upon the earth which
he [Satan] claimed as his dominion."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1079.

11. THE KINGDOMS DISTINGUISHED (Matt. 4:17; 25:31-34).

3. By what names does Jesus designate the kingdom of grace?

   Matt. 4:17

   Matt. 6:33

   Luke 17:20, 21

   The kingdom of grace that Jesus established while here on the earth
(Mark 1:15) occupied a prominent place in His preaching. Jesus mentioned
this kingdom 36 times in the book of Matthew alone; 31 times He called it
the kingdom of heaven, 5 times the kingdom of God. In His teaching,
                                                                       35
       Lesson 5                                                     August 3
      when speaking of the work of divine grace in human hearts, Jesus used the
      expressions "kingdom of God" and "kingdom of heaven." (See Matt.
      4:17; Mark 1:14, 15.)

MON   4. With what other kingdom frequently mentioned in the Bible is the
         kingdom of grace often confused? 2 Thess. 1:5; Matt. 6:10; 25:31-
         34.



          The throne of glory signifies the place and period of everlasting bliss
      that will be established upon the return of our Lord. This kingdom is re-
      ferred to in 2 Thessalonians 1:5-10 and is alluded to by the words and
      glory in 1 Thessalonians 2:12. However, before we can claim membership
      in the future kingdom of glory, we must prove faithful in the present king-
      dom of grace. This is the kingdom into which the gospel now calls us.

      I11. JESUS AND THE KINGDOM (Matt. 24:14).

      5. What question asked by the disciples at Christ's ascension shows
         that they too had difficulty distinguishing between the two
         kingdoms? Acts 1:6.



         The disciples misunderstood. "They preached the message which
      Christ had committed to them, though they themselves misapprehended its
      meaning. While their announcement was founded on Daniel 9:25, they did
      not see, in the next verse of the same chapter, that Messiah was to be cut
      off. From their very birth their hearts had been set upon the anticipated
      glory of an earthly empire, and this blinded their understanding alike to the
      specifications of the prophecy and to the words of Christ. "—The Great
      Controversy, p. 345.

        How does our eagerness for future glory sometimes cause us to
      overlook the rule of grace?

      6. When was the kingdom of grace instituted and when was it estab-
         lished? Gen. 3:15; 1 Peter 1:10-13 (compare Rom. 5:17, 18).



         The kingdom now. "The kingdom of grace was instituted immediately
      after the fall of man, when a plan was devised for the redemption of the
      guilty race. It then existed in the purpose and by the promise of God; and
      through faith, men could become its subjects. Yet it was not actually estab-
      lished until the death of Christ. Even after entering upon His earthly mis-
      sion, the Saviour, wearied with the stubbornness and ingratitude of men,
      might have drawn back from the sacrifice of Calvary. . . . But when the
      Saviour yielded up His life, and with His expiring breath cried out, 'It is
      finished,' then the fulfillment of the plan of redemption was assured. The
      36
  The Gospel and the Kingdom                                     August 3
promise of salvation made to the sinful pair in Eden was ratified. The king-
dom of grace, which had before existed by the promise of God, was then
established."—The Great Controversy, pp. 347, 348.

7. In what unmistakable way did Jesus link the kingdom of grace
   with the gospel? Matt. 24:14; Matt. 13:19.



    The gospel is the announcement that Jesus has triumphed, that He
has successfully invaded Satan's kingdom and that the process of Satan's
overthrow has begun. It is the grand declaration that Christ has passed the
critical test, that His sacrifice has been accepted by the Father, and that full
provision has been made for our redemption. (See Eph. 1:7.) Further, the
gospel is the affirmation that the kingdom of grace is available to all who
in faith accept this loving provision. Matthew 24:14 suggests that citizen-
ship in the kingdom of grace is essential for citizenship in the kingdom of
glory.

   Given Christ's linkage of gospel and kingdom, what should be the
primary thrust of our evangelism as we seek to win people to church
membership?

8. What are the keys of the kingdom mentioned by Christ in Mat-
   thew 16:18, 19 and Luke 11:52? Compare Rev. 1:18; 3:7; Acts
   4:12.



   Kingdom entrance provided. —The 'keys' to the kingdom of heaven
are the words of Christ. . . .
   "The saving power of the gospel is the only thing that admits men and
women into the kingdom of heaven. Christ simply bestowed upon Peter
and all the other disciples . . . the authority and power to bring men into the
kingdom. It was Peter's perception of the truth that Jesus is indeed the
Christ that placed the 'keys' of the kingdom in his possession and let him
into the kingdom, and the same may be said of all Christ's followers to the
very close of time."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 432.

IV. KINGDOM MEMBERSHIP (1 Thess. 1:4).

9. By what very meaningful expressions does Paul depict God's will
   for our rescue from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of
   light?

   1 Thess. 1:4

   1 Thess. 2:12

   1 Thess. 4:3

                                                                             37
       Lesson 5                                                     August 3
           1 Thess. 5:9

           2 Thess. 2:13

         How reassuring it is to know God's positive will regarding our salva-
      tion. Could Paul have stated it more clearly? All of us are included in
      God's invitation to membership in the kingdom of grace. He is "not
      willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance"
      (2 Peter 3:9).

WED   10. Through what agency, vital to the gospel proclamation, is the
          kingdom made effective in the hearts of humans? Eph. 3:14-21.



         The work of the Holy Spirit. Christ's dwelling in the heart by faith
      (Eph. 3:17) is identified with "his Spirit in the inner man" (verse 16). Be-
      cause the union of Christ and the Holy Spirit is so close, the presence of
      one is the presence of the other. When promising the gift of the Holy Spirit
      to His disciples, Jesus said: "I will not leave you comfortless: I will come
      to you" (John 14:18). His indwelling in our hearts makes us members of
      the kingdom of grace and enables us to "know the love of Christ, which
      passeth knowledge" and to "be filled with all the fulness of God" (verse
      19). What a privilege to be a subject in the kingdom of grace!

      11. While the believer is a member of the kingdom of grace, what
          visible organization claimed Paul's unquestioned dedication?
          1 Thess. 1:1; 2:14.



         The call of the gospel is first of all to kingdom membership. However,
      answering this call leads to membership in the organized church of Christ.
      The purpose of an authoritative representative body of believers is made
      obvious in Old Testament history. It also was clearly sanctioned in New
      Testament times. (See Matt. 16:18; 18:15-20; Acts 2:47; 15:1-4; 1 Cor.
      12:28-31; Rev. 12:1, 17.) The New Testament provides authority for the
      principle of church organization.
         Of course, formal connection with the church is not proof that our mem-
      bership in the kingdom of grace is intact. Proof that God's election is
      appreciated and appropriated is demonstrated by the quality of our lives,
      particularly the quality of our interaction with other members of the body
      of Christ and the witness of our lives in the world. (See 1 John 2:9-11.)

         Think it through. What specific reasons can you cite for the existence
      of the organized church? Why does the remnant church require special
      organization? Do non-Seventh-day Adventist churches fulfill these pur-
      poses? In what ways does the Seventh-day Adventist Church witness ef-
      fectively?

      12. When preaching the gospel of the kingdom (Matt. 4:23), what
      38
 The Gospel and the Kingdom                                   August 3
    vital rules of kingdom dwelling did Jesus emphasize? Matt. 5:1-
    12.



   Living by kingdom principles. The glory of Christ's character is to be
demonstrated through His believing people (John 17:22, 23). Spirit-filled
believers are inevitably bound together in Christ. His love is manifested in
the home, the school, the church, and in every institution, the members of
which are filled with His Spirit. (See Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 296,
297.)

V. THE KINGDOM EXTENDED (1 Thess. 1:6, 8).

13. What contrasting experiences did the Thessalonians have when
    they responded to the gospel call? 1 Thess. 1:6.



   "No chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous"
(Heb. 12:11). And yet these believers, ridiculed by their countrymen and
despised by the Jewish leaders of the synagogues, suffering the violence
that the kingdom always produces (Matt. 11:11, 12), had received the word
with happiness of heart.

   How is it possible for a person to be happy while suffering afflic-
tion—be it economic, psychological, social, physical, or religious?
Which is the hardest kind to endure?

14. What were the Thessalonian converts impelled to do with their
    newfound faith? 1 Thess. 1:8.



   The impact of Christ's love was so transforming and exciting that they
had to share the good news with others. When similarly impressed, we too
will witness gladly. It is impossible to see clearly and accept wholly the
love of Christ as outlined in the gospel and yet remain passive. The gospel
is exhilarating, refreshing, stimulating, reviving, and compelling. It is an
explosive, expansive, regenerating force that requires believing and pro-
vokes sharing.

   A task for everyone. "Every Christian has something to do in the serv-
ice of his Master. We are not to seek our own ease or convenience, but
rather to make the upbuilding of Christ's kingdom our first considera-
tion."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 182.

   God's scattered family. "Notwithstanding the spiritual darkness and
alienation from God that exist in the churches which constitute Babylon,
the great body of Christ's true followers are still to be found in their com-
munion."—The Great Controversy, p. 390. (See John 10:16.) In response
                                                                          39

      to the loving proclamation, "Come out of her, my people" (Rev. 18:4),
      they will join the remnant church and prepare to meet Jesus when He
      comes.

      Desire of Ages, pp. 139, 550, 551; The Great Controversy, pp. 343-354.)

      SUMMARY: The "gospel of the kingdom" that Christ commanded His
      disciples to preach is the gospel that Paul taught the Thessalonians. Be-
      cause of Jesus' sacrifice we may have citizenship in His kingdom of grace
      as a preparation for citizenship in His kingdom of glory. We must preach
      the same gospel in word and deed to all humanity before our Lord returns.

        Death and the Delay
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18.

SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "But I would not have you to be ignorant,
PM    brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not,
      even as others which have no hope" (1 Thessalonians 4:13).

DEATH IS NOT DISHONOR. The realization that our earthly sojourn
may end in death rather than in translation may produce a severe disap-
pointment, but it should not bring a sense of dishonor. The death of the
saints should not be viewed as a defeat either of God's promises or of the
Christian's hopes of witnessing Christ's return.

CONFUSION REGARDING CHRIST'S RETURN. Timothy's report
to Paul of how the young church at Thessalonica was progressing was en-
couraging, but that did not mean there were no problems. One serious con-
cern was the confusion of the new believers regarding death and dying.
Before their conversion to Christianity, the Jews and Greeks who com-
prised the bulk of the church membership had held a variety of erroneous
beliefs regarding the dead. The Thessalonians' initial acceptance of the
doctrine of the second coming of Jesus was itself a miracle. But because
their expectations of translation had not been fulfilled, frustration had
developed. As time elapsed and Christ did not come, old theories surfaced,
doubts were raised, their beliefs were ridiculed by the public, and their
confidence was weakened. Paul, who had launched them on this journey of
faith, was nowhere near to buttress or reinforce their hopes. Some among
them were feeling deceived and deserted—spiritual orphans. A crisis was
slowly developing. Upon hearing of this from Timothy, Paul quickly re-

sponded by providing the stimulating clarifications that we see in his two
Epistles.

I. TENSIONS CONCERNING THE DEAD (1 Thess. 4:13).

1. What problem regarding death and the delay was disturbing the
   believers? 1 Thess. 4:13; 5:9, 10.



   Fear of death as eternal separation. "The Thessalonians had eagerly
grasped the idea that Christ was coming to change the faithful who were
alive, and to take them to Himself. They had carefully guarded the lives of
their friends, lest they should die and lose the blessing which they looked
forward to receiving at the coming of their Lord. But one after another
their loved ones had been taken from them, and with anguish the Thes-
salonians had looked for the last time upon the faces of their dead, hardly
daring to hope to meet them in a future life."—The Acts of the Apostles, p.
258.

   The believing dead will rise again. The Thessalonians were disap-
pointed not just that death was robbing their loved ones of the privilege of
witnessing Christ's return, but that they would never see them again. That
these members lacked an understanding of the resurrection was due in no
small part to the fact that Greek mythology had little or no place for per-
sonhood in a future life. Moreover, Judaism was influenced strongly by the
belief of the Sadducees, who, for all practical purposes, denied the possi-
bility of a resurrection. Paul comforted the Thessalonians greatly by point-
ing out that they would surely live together again with their loved ones.

2. How does Paul summarize the truth regarding the state of the
   dead as it relates to the second coming of Jesus? 1 Thess. 4:13-17.



   The promises of these passages are as comforting to us today as they
were to the believers in Thessalonica. For the three years prior to 1989,
deaths of Seventh-day Adventists have averaged 23,412 a year worldwide.
Because Adventist members in most countries lead more healthful lives
than the general population, many live longer than do their fellow citizens.
However, God's people are not exempt from accidents, assaults, and dis-
eases, which claim lives prematurely. How important to cling to the prom-
ises of God and cherish the blessed hope. We need not sorrow in despair,
for we may be assured that "weeping may endure for a night, but joy com-
eth in the morning" (Ps. 30:5).

3. What effect did Paul intend his message to have upon the be-
   lievers' hearts? How were his efforts rewarded? 1 Thess. 4:18;
   1 Thess. 5:11.

         New life for the Thessalonians. "As Paul's epistle was opened and
      read, great joy and consolation was brought to the church by the words re-
      vealing the true state of the dead. Paul showed that those living when
      Christ should come would not go to meet their Lord in advance of those
      who had fallen asleep in Jesus. . . .
         "The hope and joy that this assurance brought to the young church at
      Thessalonica can scarcely be appreciated by us. They believed and
      cherished the letter sent to them by their father in the gospel, and their
      hearts went out in love to him."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 258, 259.
MON   11. TENSIONS CONCERNING DYING (1 Thess. 4:14).

      4. What fundamental doctrine is stressed in each of the five chapters
         of Paul's first letter to the Thessalonians?

         1 Thess. 1:10

         1 Thess. 2:19, 20

         1 Thess. 3:13

         1 Thess. 4:16-18

         1 Thess. 5:23

         The return of his Lord was a treasured hope that Paul constantly shared
      with his hearers. "Paul was an Adventist; he presented the important event
      of the second coming of Christ with such power and reasoning that a deep
      impression, which never wore away, was made upon the minds of the
      Thessalonians."—Sketches From the Life of Paul, p. 83.

      5. How did Paul address the believers' fear of not living to witness
         the return of Christ? 1 Thess. 4:14; 5:9, 10.



         Death not the end. Paul wanted the believers to know that death before
      Christ's second coming is not a breach of God's promises. Their prevailing
      expectation was that they would not die. They believed so ardently in
      Christ's imminent return that death for them had been unthinkable. Yet
      they were dying, and the longer the list of their dead grew, the more con-
      fused they became theologically and emotionally. By emphasizing, as he
      does in 1 Thessalonians, the possibility of their sleeping before Jesus' re-
      turn, the apostle sought to relieve their tensions. He provided them and us
      a proper frame of reference for death as it relates to the second coming of
      Christ.

      6. While death as a prospect is no more pleasant for us today than
         for these early believers, what practical counsel should we keep in
         mind? Ps. 90:10-12; 1 Cor. 4:2.

                                                                               43
  Lesson 6                                                    August 10
   The wisdom of a will. "Those who are faithful stewards of the Lord's
means will know just how their business stands, and, like wise men, they
will be prepared for any emergency. Should their probation close suddenly,
they would not leave such great perplexity upon those who are called to
settle their estate. . . .
   "Death will not come one day sooner, brethren, because you have made
your will. In disposing of your property by will to your relatives, be sure
that you do not forget God's cause. You are His agents, holding His prop-
erty; and His claims should have your first consideration. Your wife and
children, of course, should not be left destitute; provision should be made
for them if they are needy. But do not, simply because it is customary,
bring into your will a long line of relatives who are not needy."—The Ad-
ventist Home, p. 397.

   Do you know the name of the trust officer of your local conference
or mission? Have you thought about including in your will the needs of
foreign and home missions, Christian education, and the impoverished
and needy people of your community and of the world?

     ING (1 Thess. 5:5, 9).

7. In what way do Paul's words appear to contribute to the idea of
   the imminent return of Christ? 1 Thess. 4:17.



   Paul's remarks are not the only ones in Scripture that lead to expecta-
tion of the imminent return of Christ. There are many others. (See 2 Peter
3:10-13; Luke 17:26-30; Matt. 24:3-14, 27, 29, 30; Rev. 6:12-17.)

8. While Paul's language conveys the idea of immediacy, what hint
   does he give of the possibility of delay? 1 Thess. 5:9, 10.



9. What indications did Christ Himself give of the possibility, or even
   the necessity, of delay? Matt. 24:6, 8, 29, 48; 25:5, 14-19.



   The Thessalonian believers cannot be faulted for their hopes, even ex-
pectations, of the imminent return of Jesus. Given their newness in the
faith, their brief experience with Paul, and the natural longing of all Chris-
tians for deliverance from this wicked world and for eternal fellowship
with Christ, they had reason to hope, but also reason to wonder—why
death? Nevertheless, closer scrutiny of the apostle's message, as well as of
the words of Christ, would have alerted them to the possibility of a lengthy
wait.

IV. PAUL'S HARMONY OF HOPE (2 Thess. 2:2).

10. How is it possible to harmonize Paul's view of a more distant
    Second Coming in 2 Thessalonians 2:2 with the impression of
    "suddenness" and "immediacy" given in such places as 1 Thes-
    salonians 5:3 and Romans 13:11, 12?



   In 1 Thessalonians 4:17 Paul speaks of being translated; in 1 Corinthi-
ans 6:14 he speaks of being resurrected. It appears that while Paul hoped
that all the signs would be completed and Christ would come in his day, he
did not predict a time of Christ's return. A serious review of his personal
reflections regarding the time of Christ's return discloses a picture of a
hopeful believer who was nevertheless prepared to die because: (1) He
trusted God's wisdom concerning the timing of His appearance, and (2) He
trusted God's promises and powers of resurrection.

11. What grim reality of human experience makes the Advent an im-
    mediate event for every human being? Eccl. 9:5; Ps. 90:10.



   As soon as we are born we begin to die. Because death is a sleep from
which we eventually shall awaken, and because we shall be in the presence
of the Lord of judgment in the initial moments of consciousness following
the sleep of death, it is true that Christ's appearing is both soon and sudden
for each of us. Life is short. Even those who live what we regard as a long
time, really stay but briefly upon the earth. Furthermore, recurring catas-
trophies by sea, air, and land make it truer than ever that we all walk with
"but one step between us and death."

12. From what other perspective is it possible to think of Christ's
    return as being soon? Ps. 90:1-4 (compare 2 Peter 3:8-10).



13. What graphic phrase coined by Zechariah accurately describes
    those who wait in hope for the return of Christ? Zech. 9:12.



   Captured by the love of Christ, all who sincerely believe are prisoners
of hope. It is the paradox of faith that while we believe that Christ is coming
soon, we do not know precisely how soon. As were our predecessors, we are
prisoners of hope, living in the bound freedom of the righteous kingdom—
willingly committed, patiently waiting, and knowingly dying. Pleading,
with the saints of all times, "How long, 0 Lord? How long?" we conscious-
ly declare our allegiance and approach our graves, if that must be, affirming
with the patriarch Job, "For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he
shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: and though after my skin worms
                                                                            45
 Lesson 6                                                     August 10
destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God" (Job 19:25, 26).

V. THE BASIS FOR HOPE (1 Thess. 4:14, 15).

14. Upon what glorious event did Paul base the triumphal promises
    of the last six verses of 1 Thessalonians 4? 1 Thess. 4:14.



    "The Pharaoh-gods of Egypt were still in their graves until their
mummified remains were placed on show in the world's museums. Parts of
Buddha's body are enshrined as relics in different places in the East. The
tomb of Confucius in China is still occupied—and the grave of Mo-
hammed at Medina in Arabia is not an empty grave. But the tomb of Jesus
Christ is empty. 'He is not here, but is risen!' . . .
    "Jesus urged His followers to look beyond this life, beyond the grave,
beyond death. To prove what He said, He laid down His life and on the
third day rose from the dead. Says Paul, the resurrection of your loved ones
is as certain as the resurrection of Christ. Your hope and mine for resurrec-
tion from death depends entirely on the irrefutable fact that Jesus defeated
death."—Derek M. Marley, Death and Beyond (Grantham, England: Stan-
borough Press), pp. 19, 20.

  What factors in nature also stimulate and sustain our resurrection
hopes?

15. What further thoughts on this subject did Paul provide when
    writing to the church at Corinth a few years later? 1 Cor. 15:14-
    19, 51-58.



   Many theories; one truth. We did not ask to be born. No one is here
because of self-determination. Since we are here and obviously are not im-
mortal, we must make decisions regarding the future. There are many theo-
ries. These include the belief that (a) death ends one's existence forever—
that there is nothing beyond, (b) death is followed by reincarnation as
another person, animal, object, or spirit, (c) death is followed immediately
by a happy or miserable life in another world, and (d) death is the tem-
porary cessation of all life functions, to be reversed by a resurrection that
will restore the individual to eternal life or to eternal destruction. The op-
tion a person chooses has pervasive meaning for that individual's world-
view and lifestyle.
   The last of the above options, that of resurrection to eternal life, is
the Christian hope. It is the only one consistent with the Word of God.
We must await the fulfillment of our desires to prove their veracity, but
without that hope we are, as Paul states, "of all men most miserable"
(1 Cor. 15:19). And to those who say we are dreamers, we reply, "It is
better to die with an unfulfilled expectation than to live with no hope at
all."

      PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
        • How long have you been a member of the Seventh-day Adventist
          Church?
        • What explanation do you give for the apparent delay of the Advent?
        • If you should die next week, who would be responsible for your
          children? Have you designated the one to take care of your financial
          obligations? Have you given clear instructions on how your money
          should be divided?
        • Is it wrong for one who believes in Christ's return to have life in-
          surance?
        • Whom do you especially wish to see in the earth made new?

FRI   FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION:
         What Jesus says about His delay: Matt. 24:42-51; 25:1-13; Mark 5:39;
      John 11:11.
         What Paul says elsewhere: 1 Cor. 15:20-26.
         What Ellen White says: "Especially important to the church in our time
      are the teachings of the apostle upon this point. To those living so near the
      great consummation, the words of Paul should come with telling force:
      `Let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and
      love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.' "—The Acts of the Apostles,
      p. 260.

      SUMMARY: Translation to eternal life is preferable to death and resur-
      rection, not because of any advantage at or after Christ's second coming; it
      is preferable because the thought of death is painful to us and to the hearts
      of those who survive us. But death has lost its sting to the believer, because
      he will awake to greet the Lord of life.

     The Consequences and
       Manner of Christ's
            Coming
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18.

SAB     MEMORY TEXT: "For the Lord himself shall descend from
PM
        heaven with a shout, with a voice of the archangel, and with the
        trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we
        which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with
        them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we
        ever be with the Lord" (1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17).

PAUL PREDICTS NOT WHEN—BUT HOW, AND WHAT THEN.
While Paul at no time intended to pinpoint the moment of Christ's second
coming, in 1 Thessalonians 4 he is quite specific regarding the manner and
the consequences of His appearing.

LESSON OUTLINE:
    I. Consequences for the Righteous Dead (1 Thess. 4:14-16).
   11. Consequences for the Righteous Living (1 Thess. 4:17).
 I11. Consequences for the Wicked Living (1 Thess. 5:2, 3).
  IV. Consequences for the Wicked Dead (Rev. 20:5, 6).
   V. The Manner of Christ's Return (1 Thess. 4:16).

THE DAY OF THE LORD. We know exactly when Christ's final offen-
sive against sin began—A.D. 31—when our Lord successfully completed
His mission on earth. This date was projected in Daniel 9:24-27 and was
clearly fulfilled in the life of Christ. Although we do not know the date of
final victory, in the writings of Paul and other Bible writers we are provided
an arresting picture of what that victory will be like when it takes place.
    First Thessalonians 4:13-18 is more than a description of the final
triumph. It is a rich source of information regarding a number of details
connected with that climactic event. Among the many aspects of the Ad-
vent illumined in this passage are: the fate of the living righteous; the fate
of the righteous dead; and, by implication, the fate of the wicked living and

dead. All four of these concerns are involved in Paul's description of what
he terms "the day of the Lord"—the second coming of Christ.
    The questions that Paul answers regarding the state of the dead, life
after death, and the end of human history are the fundamental considera-
tions of all religions. The belief of so-called nonreligionists that there is no
life after death is itself a religious tenet; it deals with two of the most vital
of all religious questions—Is there a God? and Where do we go when we
die? Our lesson this week will address these and other ultimate concerns as
depicted in the writings of the inspired apostle.

I. CONSEQUENCES FOR THE RIGHTEOUS DEAD (1 Thess.
   4:14-16).

1. What stunning event inexplicable to human reason opens the
   drama of consequences at the second coming of Christ? 1 Thess.
   4:14-16.



2. Who will comprise a large and very happy class of the righteous
   resurrected? Rev. 6:9-11.



    The last become first. "The heirs of God have come from garrets, from
hovels, from dungeons, from scaffolds, from mountains, from deserts, from
the caves of the earth, from the caverns of the sea. On earth they were 'des-
titute, afflicted, tormented.' Millions went down to the grave loaded with in-
famy because they steadfastly refused to yield to the deceptive claims of
Satan. By human tribunals they were adjudged the vilest of criminals. But
now 'God is judge himself.' Psalm 50:6. Now the decisions of earth are
reversed. 'The rebuke of his people shall he take away.' Isaiah 25:8. 'They
shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the Lord.' He hath ap-
pointed 'to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the
garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.' Isaiah 62:12; 61:3. They are no
longer feeble, afflicted, scattered, and oppressed. Henceforth they are to be
ever with the Lord."—The Great Controversy, p. 650.

3. How will the form of the resurrected righteous compare with their
   former physical state? John 20:15-18; Phil. 3:20, 21.



   Identity preserved. "Our personal identity is preserved in the resurrec-
tion, though not the same particles of matter or material substance as went
into the grave. The wondrous works of God are a mystery to man. The
spirit, the character of man, is returned to God, there to be preserved. In the
resurrection every man will have his own character. God in His own time
will call forth the dead, giving again the breath of life, and bidding the dry
bones live. The same form will come forth, but it will be free from disease
and every defect. It lives again bearing the same individuality of features,
                                                                              49

      so that friend will recognize friend. There is no law of God in nature which
      shows that God gives back the same identical particles of matter which
      composed the body before death. God shall give the righteous dead a body
      that will please Him."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commen-
      tary, vol. 6, p. 1093.

      4. What miracle of Christ's more than any other anticipated His
         resurrecting the righteous dead? John 11:41-44.



         Because He is the Deity, the life of Christ is unborrowed, original, and
      underived. He is the author of life, the source of life, the origin of all that
      lives and breathes on this planet and throughout the universe. All things
      were made by Him, and He has the power to recreate that which has died.
      (See John 1:1-3; Col. 1:16; John 11:25.)

MON   11. CONSEQUENCES FOR THE RIGHTEOUS LIVING (1 Thess.
          4:17).

      5. What joyous response will the righteous living make to the ap-
         pearance of Christ? Isa. 25:8, 9.



          It is impossible to describe what the living righteous will feel and think
      at that glad hour. All the saints who died in the faith of the three angels'
      messages will be brought forth in a special resurrection to witness the com-
      ing of their Lord. (See Daniel 12:2; The Great Controversy, p. 637.) The
      living righteous will behold the small cloud in the east swell into a bright-
      ness that engulfs heaven. In the dazzling glow they will behold the pres-
      ence of the King.

      6. What glorious transformation will the righteous living experience?
         1 Thess. 4:17; 1 Cor. 15:51-54.



         Forever changed. "The living righteous are changed 'in a moment, in
      the twinkling of an eye.' At the voice of God they were glorified; now they
      are made immortal and with the risen saints are caught up to meet their
      Lord in the air. Angels 'gather together His elect from the four winds, from
      one end of heaven to the other.' Little children are borne by holy angels to
      their mothers' arms. Friends long separated by death are united, nevermore
      to part, and with songs of gladness ascend together to the City of God."—
      The Great Controversy, p. 645.

      7. What experience in the life of Christ most clearly prefigures the
         consequences of the Second Coming for His faithful people? Luke
         9:28-35.

      50
        Christ's Coming                                            August 17
         A preview of glory. "In these glorified ones, the disciples saw in min-
      iature a representation of the kingdom of the redeemed. They beheld Jesus
      clothed with the light of heaven; they heard the 'voice out of the cloud'
      (Luke 9:35), acknowledging Him as the Son of God; they saw Moses, rep-
      resenting those who will be raised from the dead at the time of the second
      advent; and there also stood Elijah, representing those who at the close of
      earth's history will be changed from mortal to immortal and be translated
      to heaven without seeing death."—Prophets and Kings, p. 227.

      I11. CONSEQUENCES FOR THE WICKED LIVING (1 Thess. 5:2,
111        3).

       8. By what Old Testament designation does Paul label the second
          coming of Christ? 1 Thess. 5:2; Amos 5:18-20.



       9. How does the New Testament elsewhere describe this climactic
          day or event?

          John 6:39, 40

          Rom. 2:5

          1 Cor. 1:7, 8

          2 Peter 2:9

          2 Peter 3:12

      10. Upon whom does the wrath of God fall at the second coming of
          Christ? 2 Thess. 1:5-10.



         For the living righteous there is joyous reward. For the living wicked
      there is awesome recompense. "Because sentence against an evil work is
      not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in
      them to do evil" (Eccl. 8:11). The divine Watcher is keeping accurate rec-
      ords and will treat every person justly. The Lord will mete out final recom-
      pense at the end of the millennium (see Rev. 20:7-9), but the glory of the
      Second Coming will destroy the living wicked at the beginning of the
      millennium. (See 2 Thess. 2:8.)

      11. How does Isaiah typify the punishment connected with the day of
          wrath? Isa. 28:21.



         God's strange act. "God is, by nature, merciful, gracious, and long-
      suffering. . . . It is alien to His character to inflict pain and suffering,
                                                                                51
       Lesson 7                                                    August 17
      punishment and death, upon His creatures. But at the same time He will
      `by no means clear the guilty' (Ex. 34:7). Sometimes divine justice seems
      so long delayed that men conclude it will never come (Eccl. 8:11; Zeph.
      1:12; Mal. 2:17; 3:14), and that they may go on in their evil ways with im-
      punity. All who thus presume to take advantage of God's long-suffering
      and mercy are here warned that judgment is sure to come. . . . When Christ
      appears as a warrior to subdue His enemies (Rev. 19:11-21), men will see
      Him acting in a role that appears vastly different from anything they have
      known before. The Lamb of God will then appear as 'the Lion of the tribe
      of Juda' (Rev. 5:5, 6)."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 212.
WED   IV. CONSEQUENCES FOR THE WICKED DEAD (Rev. 20:5, 6).

      12. What happens to the wicked dead? Rev. 20:5, 6.



         Paul does not mention the wicked dead in 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18. The
      implication of the passage is that they are unaffected by the second coming
      of Christ. John makes clear that these are brought forth in the second res-
      urrection, at the conclusion of the millennium, when they are eternally de-
      stroyed. (See Rev. 20:9, 10.)

      13. Since the wicked dead do not live again until the end of the 1,000-
          year period, how do we explain John's statement in Revelation
          1:7 that those who pierced Him will witness His second coming?
          Matt. 26:64; Dan. 12:1, 2.



         The first become last. At His trial Jesus predicted that His persecutors
      would see His second coming. "Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sit-
      ting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven"
      (Matt. 26:64). Since the wicked dead are not raised until the end of the
      millennium (Rev. 20:5), the resurrection of those who condemned and
      crucified Christ must be a partial resurrection immediately prior to the Sec-
      ond Advent. Daniel 12:2 predicts that some righteous and some wicked
      will be raised at the Advent. (See The Desire of Ages, pp. 739, 740; The
      Great Controversy, p. 637.)

      14. What graphic illustrations portray the wicked's response to the
          sudden trauma of Christ's appearing? 1 Thess. 5:3; Matt. 22:12,
          13; Rev. 6:14-17.



      V. THE MANNER OF CHRIST'S RETURN (1 Thess. 4:16).

      15. While Paul speaks hopefully of his being among those who will be
          translated, what is the true emphasis of 1 Thessalonians 4:13-17?

      52
  Christ's Coming                                              August 17
   Date setting is hazardous. Paul could not tell the believers at Thes-
salonica the year or the day of Christ's return. He did not know. Neither do
we. Those individuals who work out dates and draw up schematics show-
ing the return to be at a certain point, or within a certain period, or by a
certain date, or before a certain event, do so without the permission of the
Word of God. Since it has always been possible to see in current events the
fulfillment of prophecies of Christ's return, the anticipation of the early
Christians was normal. They wished to be alive for that event. However,
because most of God's promises are conditional and because the baleful
results of the unfulfilled desire for certainty drive us toward either fanati-
cism or despondency, precise calculations and predictions should be
studiously avoided.

    The manner and consequences. Paul's discussion of the Second Com-
ing in 1 Thessalonians emphasizes the manner and consequences, not the
hour or time of Christ's return. Paul informs us that (a) Christ will descend
from above in a manner consistent with John's promise that "every eye
shall see him" (Rev. 1:7), (b) He will employ voice and trumpet to an-
nounce His appearance and to awaken the dead, (c) God the Father and the
holy angels will accompany Him, (d) His appearance will be as a flaming
fire to the wicked, (e) His timing will be as that of a thief in the night, and
(f) the living righteous will be gathered with the resurrected righteous in
the clouds and escorted by heavenly hosts to their celestial abode.

16. What cosmic sounds herald the appearance of our Lord? 1 Thess.
    4:16.



    The end of earth's history announced. Of all biblical descriptions of
the second coming of Christ, none is more spectacular than this. The Lord
Himself is shouting, the highest angel in heaven is calling, and some celes-
tial being is filling the airwaves with the trumpet sound that is evidently re-
served for God's use on special occasions—all fitting precursors to the cli-
max of this planet's sin-cursed existence.
    Paul does not say who will do the shouting, but in the light of John 5:28
it is reasonable to believe that it is Christ who here expresses Himself. Nor
does Paul identify the archangel who speaks, but since Michael is the only
archangel mentioned in the New Testament (Jude 9), the conclusion of
most is that this too is Jesus. The trump of God is mentioned elsewhere
(1 Cor. 15:52; Matt. 24:31) and is, apparently, sounded by an angel or an-
gels. Paul does not make these details clear. What is clear, however, is that
they are all acts of authority and triumph whereby the God of creation an-
nounces the end of earth's history as we now experience it.

17. By what authority does Paul proclaim, not the time, but the man-
    ner and consequences of these cataclysmic events? 1 Thess. 4:15.



   Paul could evoke no greater assurance than the Word of the Lord. His
                                                                     53

offensive strikes against superstition and sin and was made possible and ef-
fective by faith in the Word of God. The Word is still the Christian's only
weapon of aggression and defense. The Word gives us faith, the Word
gives us power, the Word gives personal victory. Paul had no proof; that is,
he could not physically demonstrate that what he was saying was true. But
he did have evidence of the workings of the Word in fulfilled prophecies
and in the changes it had wrought in his own life, as well as the lives of
others. This is what gave him confidence, and to this more than any other
source he rightly appealed.

ASK YOURSELF:
  • What reasons can I give for God's raising the righteous dead before
    translating the righteous living?
  • Why are those who crucified Jesus raised to see Him coming the
    second time?
  • How does God's act of destroying the wicked fit my concept of His
    love and mercy?
  • Why is it important for me to know the manner and consequences of
    Christ's coming?

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION:
   What Jesus says about His second coming: Luke 17:22-24; 13:23-29.
   What Paul says elsewhere: 1 Cor. 15:35-58.
   What Ellen White says: "To the believer, death is but a small matter.
Christ speaks of it as if it were of little moment. 'If a man keep my saying,
he shall never see death,' he shall never taste of death.' To the Christian,
death is but a sleep, a moment of silence and darkness. The life is hid with
Christ in God, and 'when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye
also appear with Him in glory.' "—The Desire of Ages, p. 787.
   Also read "God's People Delivered" in The Great Controversy, pp.
635-652.

SUMMARY: Because of the inevitable result of sin's inherent con-
sequences, for the wicked the Second Coming will mean unspeakable pain;
for the righteous it will mean indescribable joy and satisfaction. The most
thrilling aspect of the redeemed's experience will be the privilege at last of
beholding Christ, whose trumpet and voice reunite and immortalize the
righteous.

 Signs of Christ's Coming
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12.

SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "And then shall that Wicked be revealed,
PM
      whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and
      shall destroy with the brightness of his coming" (2 Thessalonians
      2:8).

THE MAN OF SIN. In 2 Thessalonians 2, Paul outlines the ways in
which the man of sin will orchestrate the mystery of iniquity. While the
process had already begun in his day, its full development is even yet
being accomplished. It is possible, and from all signs probable, that our
generation will see the final act of the drama, the completion of this pri-
mary harbinger of Christ's return.

LESSON OUTLINE:
    I. The Man of Sin Introduced (2 Thess. 2:3).
   11. The Man of Sin Described (2 Thess. 2:4, 7).
  I11. The Man of Sin Revealed (Dan. 7:24, 25).
  IV. The Counterfeit Coming (2 Thess. 2:9, 10).
   V. The Christian's Defense (2 Thess. 2:10-12).

SATAN'S MASTERPIECE. The great controversy that Satan has waged
against God's people is but an extension of the insurrection that he inaugu-
rated in heaven. (See Rev. 12:7-9.) Through various means, among them
persecution, compromise, material prosperity, and even societal praise and
acceptance, he is doing his utmost to defeat the plan of salvation. He
knows that at Calvary his doom was sealed, his kingdom of evil destined
for extinction. He is now busy trying to destroy as many individuals as
possible. Hatred for Christ and the desire to deplete His kingdom are his
primary motives.
   The masterpiece of all Satan's programs of deception, the one that has
succeeded in causing more loss of life than any other, is the work of the
mystery of lawlessness or the "man of sin." This week's lesson will ex-
plore the nature and consequences of this masterful deception.

I. THE MAN OF SIN INTRODUCED (2 Thess. 2:3).

1. What names does Paul ascribe to the individual or power most
   prominently associated with the "falling away" from strict biblical
   injunctions? 2 Thess. 2:3.



   The Bible gives us signs in four distinct realms. There are signs in the
natural world (Matt. 24:7), signs in the social world (Luke 17:26-28), signs
in the political world (Matt. 24:6; 1 Thess. 5:3), and signs in the religious
world. The "falling away" (Greek apostasia = "apostasy") described in
2 Thessalonians 2:3 is the religious sign of prime importance. "Falling
away" involves a diminishing of fervor, a loss of zeal, a lessening of com-
mitment to Christ, departure from strict, faithful following of His com-
mands, capitulation to a lesser intensity of belief and Christian lifestyle.
Other signs in the religious world are recorded in Matthew 24:5, 6, 14, 24,
and Revelation 14:6-12.

2. How do John's messages to the Christian church harmonize with
   Paul's prediction?

     Rev. 2:4

     Rev. 2:9

     Rev. 2:13, 15

     Rev. 2:20

     Rev. 3:1

     Rev. 3:9

     Rev. 3:16

   The seven churches of Revelation 2 and 3 represent seven consecutive
time periods of church history stretching from Christ's departure to His
second coming. Christ's messages to the seven churches in Asia Minor are
His messages to the church throughout the seven phases of its history.
These messages anticipated the progressive spiritual decline in the church
leading to the medieval papacy ("that woman Jezebel"—Rev. 2:20), the
spiritless post-Reformation church (Sardis), and the lukewarm church of
Laodicea.
   Under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, John predicted that the medi-
eval papacy and the spiritless post-Reformation Protestant church would
eventually unite to establish Satan's end-time masterpiece of deception.
(See Revelation 13 and 17.) John's predictions and those of Paul (see
2 Thessalonians 2) refer to the similar apostasy and antichristian religious
union of the last days.

11. THE MAN OF SIN DESCRIBED (2 Thess. 2:4, 7).

3. What specific un-Christ-like attitudes characterized the "man of
   sin"? 2 Thess. 2:4.



    "Opposing and exalting oneself above all that is called God" or that is
worshiped means to claim for humanity the powers, the prowess, the wis-
dom, the prerogatives that are distinctly and uniquely God's. Sitting "in
the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God" means to demand of
fellow human beings worship, adoration, and surrender due only our Crea-
tor.

4. What other name is given to this power? What is the significance
   of this name? 2 Thess. 2:7.



    Mystery here means something hidden, knowledge in secret, infor-
mation held in confidence by an initiated few. Iniquity means transgression
of the law. It is clear then that whatever the identity of this power, it will
challenge or claim God's authority and will surreptitiously transgress or
defy the law of God. Because God's law is an expression of His character,
Satan's chief aim is to depreciate its value and to demonstrate that it can-
not be obeyed.
    The New International Version translates 2 Thessalonians 2:7: "For the
secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds
it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way."

5. Whose spirit and example are clearly expressed in the attitude and
   work of the man of sin? Isa. 14:12-14.



   "In the last analysis, this description [2 Thess. 2:7] applies to Satan, the
author of lawlessness . . . but the devil has generally camouflaged his per-
sonality by working through agents. . . .
   "Hence the 'man of sin' and 'the mystery of iniquity' may be con-
sidered as representing the same apostate papal power . . . ; and behind all
human manifestations of iniquity stands Satan himself, who in the end will
play a personal role in an effort to lead the whole world captive."—SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 272.

I11. THE MAN OF SIN REVEALED (Dan. 7:24, 25).

6. How do the system and history of papal Rome fulfill the predic-
   tions of this apostate power given in 2 Thessalonians 2:4?



                                                                            57
        Lesson 8                                                     August 24
         The boldness of papal Rome, in declaring that its priests have the power
      to forgive sin and in stating that its head of government exercises divine
      powers, leaves little doubt that it is the power of which Paul is here speak-
      ing.

      7. How does Daniel in a parallel passage further identify the apostate
         power? Dan. 7:23-25.



          The prediction of a power that would arise to: (a) "speak great words
      against the most High," (b) "wear out the saints of the most High," and
      (c) "think to change times and laws" has remarkable fulfillment in the his-
      tory of the Roman Church. Notice how its history conforms to the descrip-
      tion of Daniel 7:23-25:
          A. It rose up from the ten divisions of the fourth beast, the Roman Em-
      pire. (See Dan. 7:1-8, 23.)
          B. It spoke words against the Most High in its declaration that the pope
      exercises God's authority on earth.
          C. It sought to wear out the saints of the Most High by the persecutions
      during the period of its ecclesiastical supremacy (538-1798).
          D. It changed divine times and laws by substituting Sunday worship for
      worship on the seventh day, God's holy Sabbath day. This latter act, ac-
      complished during the early stages of the Smyrna period (the immediate
      postapostolic period), is a key element in the identification process. Per-
      haps unintentionally, but nevertheless unmistakably, papal Rome confesses
      its guilt by claiming that its change of the Sabbath from the seventh to the
      first day of the week demonstrates its religious and spiritual supremacy.
      Typical of its historical position in this matter is the following statement:
          "If the Bible is the only guide for the Christian, then the Seventh Day
      Adventist is right in observing the Saturday with the Jew. But Catholics
      learn what to believe and do from the divine, infallible authority estab-
      lished by Jesus Christ, the Catholic Church [papal Rome], which in Apos-
      tolic times made Sunday the day of rest. . . . Is it not strange that those who
      make the Bible their only teacher should inconsistently follow in this mat-
      ter the tradition of the Church?"—Bertrand L. Conway, The Question-Box
      Answers, 1903 ed., p. 254.

          Does the indictment of the system (papal Rome) mean that all of its
      leaders and members are evil? Is it right to charge modern-day
      Catholics with the mistakes of their predecessors? In what sense is
      Catholicism today guilty of apostasy? Will all Catholics be lost? Will
      all Adventists be saved?

WED   IV. THE COUNTERFEIT COMING (2 Thess. 2:9, 10).

      8. In another of his bold attempts to deceive the world, what last
         desperate effort does Satan make? 2 Thess. 2:9, 10.



      58
 Signs of Christ's Coming                                    August 24
   The crowning act. The deceptions of the last days perpetrated by the
"man of sin" will culminate in Satan's attempt to impersonate Christ:
   "As the crowning act in the great drama of deception, Satan himself
will personate Christ. The church has long professed to look to the
Saviour's advent as the consummation for her hopes. Now the great
deceiver will make it appear that Christ has come. In different parts of the
earth, Satan will manifest himself among men as a majestic being of daz-
zling brightness, resembling the description of the Son of God given by
John in the Revelation. Revelation 1:13-15. The glory that surrounds him
is unsurpassed by anything that mortal eyes have yet beheld. The shout of
triumph rings out upon the air: 'Christ has come! Christ has come!' "—
The Great Controversy, p. 624.

9. Following what date and what events can both the imitation and
    the genuine Second Coming be expected? Compare 2 Thess. 2:3
    with Dan. 7:25.


   When to start looking. "The apostle Paul warned the church not to
look for the coming of Christ in his day. 'That day shall not come,' he
says, 'except there come .a falling away first, and that man of sin be re-
vealed.' 2 Thessalonians 2:3. Not till after the great apostasy, and the long
period of the reign of the 'man of sin,' can we look for the advent of our
Lord. The 'man of sin,' which is also styled 'the mystery of iniquity,' the
son of perdition,' and 'that wicked,' represents the papacy, which, as fore-
told in prophecy, was to maintain its supremacy for 1260 years. This pe-
riod ended in 1798. The coming of Christ could not take place before that
time. Paul covers with his caution the whole of the Christian dispensation
down to the year 1798. It is this side of that time that the message of
Christ's second coming is to be proclaimed."—The Great Controversy, p.
356.
10. While the coming of Christ was not to take place prior to 1798,
    what has been the case since then?


   Statements are cited in the book Evangelism (p. 694) explaining the rea-
son for the delay of the Advent:

   A statement made in 1868: "The long night of gloom is trying, but the
morning is deferred in mercy, because if the Master should come, so many
would be found unready. God's unwillingness to have His people perish,
has been the reason of so long delay."
   A statement made in 1900: "Had the purpose of God been carried out
by His people in giving to the world the message of mercy, Christ would,
ere this, have come to the earth, and the saints would have received their
welcome into the city of God."

                                                                          59
  Lesson 8                                                    August 24
  A statement made in 1909: "The work is years behind. While men
have slept, Satan has stolen a march upon us."

11. Even though we are now nearly two centuries past 1798, what
    cautions should we observe in relation to date setting?



   "The apostle's admonition to the Thessalonians contains an important
lesson for those who live in the last days. Many Adventists have felt that
unless they could fix their faith upon a definite time for the Lord's coming,
they could not be zealous and diligent in the work of preparation. But as
their hopes are again and again excited, only to be destroyed, their faith re-
ceives such a shock that it becomes well-nigh impossible for them to be
impressed by the great truths of prophecy. . . .
   "The more frequently a definite time is set for the second advent, and
the more widely it is taught, the better it suits the purposes of Satan. After
the time has passed, he excites ridicule and contempt of its advocates, and
thus casts reproach upon the great advent movement of 1843 and 1844."—
The Great Controversy, p. 457.

V. THE CHRISTIAN'S DEFENSE (2 Thess. 2:10-12).

   "For hundreds of years the circulation of the Bible was prohibited. The
people were forbidden to read it or to have it in their houses, and unprin-
cipled priests and prelates interpreted its teachings to sustain their preten-
sions. Thus the pope came to be almost universally acknowledged as the
vicegerent of God on earth, endowed with authority over church and state.
   "The detector of error having been removed, Satan worked according
to his will."—The Great Controversy, p. 51.

12. How are the righteous protected from being deceived by the
    counterfeit Second Coming and all other errors regarding
    Christ's return? 2 Thess. 2:10-12.



   Our primary protection. "Only those who have been diligent students
of the Scriptures and who have received the love of the truth will be
shielded from the powerful delusion that takes the world captive. By the
Bible testimony these will detect the deceiver in his disguise. To all the
testing time will come. By the sifting of temptation the genuine Christian
will be revealed. Are the people of God now so firmly established upon
His word that they would not yield to the evidence of their senses? Would
they, in such a crisis, cling to the Bible and the Bible only?"—The Great
Controversy, p. 625.

13. What other spiritual activities does Jesus recommend as neces-
    sary to avoid spiritual disaster? Matt. 17:21; 4:2.


60
 Signs of Christ's Coming                                      August 24
   A deeper experience. "We need to humble ourselves before the Lord,
with fasting and prayer, and to meditate much upon His word, especially
upon the scenes of the judgment. We should now seek a deep and living
experience in the things of God. We have not a moment to lose. Events of
vital importance are taking place around us; we are on Satan's enchanted
ground. Sleep not, sentinels of God; the foe is lurking near, ready at any
moment, should you become lax and drowsy, to spring upon you and make
you his prey."—The Great Controversy, p. 601.

FURTHER READING AND MEDITATION:
   What Jesus says about the signs of His second coming: Matt. 24:4-27.
   What Paul says elsewhere: 2 Tim. 2:15-19; 3:1-5.
   What Ellen White says: "I was shown that the law of God would stand
fast forever, and exist in the new earth to all eternity. . . .
   "I saw that the Sabbath never will be done away; but that the redeemed
saints, and all the angelic host, will observe it in honor of the great Creator
to all eternity."—Early Writings, pp. 215-217.
   "Let opposition arise, let bigotry and intolerance again bear sway, let
persecution be kindled, and the half-hearted and hypocritical will waver
and yield the faith; but the true Christian will stand firm as a rock, his faith
stronger, his hope brighter, than in days of prosperity."—The Great Con-
troversy, p. 602.
   Also read the chapter entitled "The Scriptures a Safeguard" in The
Great Controversy, pp. 593-602.
SUMMARY: The activities of the man of sin are in direct contrast to
those of the Man of Sorrows. Jesus enlightens humanity—Satan enslaves
humanity; Jesus directs us to His law—Satan condemns us by the law;
Jesus' single purpose was to honor the Father's will in the rescue of His
creatures—Satan's great obsession is to misrepresent God as being like
himself, and himself as being like God. By such misrepresentation he en-
deavors to thwart God's will and to cause the destruction of His creatures.

August 25-31



       Watching and Waiting
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Thessalonians 3:1-10.

SAB    MEMORY TEXT: "And the Lord direct your hearts into the
PM
       love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ" (2 Thes-
       salonians 3:5).

WAITING PATIENTLY PRESENTS A PRIMARY CHALLENGE.
The need to wait patiently for Christ presents a primary challenge to the
Christian. It also represents a major difference in the world view that sepa-
rates believers from nonbelievers.

LESSON OUTLINE:
    I. The Caution Repeated (2 Thess. 2:1, 2; 3:6).
   11. The Peril of Deceit (2 Thess. 2:3, 10).
 I11. The Believer's Challenge (2 Thess. 3:5).
  IV. The Ingredients of Patience (1 Thess. 5:8).
   V. The Waiting Remnant (Rev. 14:12).

THE PARADOX OF FAITH. Paul desired that his words regarding the
resurrection of the righteous would relieve the believer's tensions about
dying before the Advent. However, he did not intend that the Thessalo-
nians relax or lessen their faith in or hope of the Second Coming. Theirs
was a paradox of faith. As trusting disciples, they were to be comforted by
the promises of the resurrection; but as hopeful pilgrims they were to ob-
serve carefully the signs of Christ's coming and earnestly prepare for that
event.
   Hope despite disappointment. Such has been the case with each
generation of Christians since Jesus ascended. All have been disappointed.
In the case of the Thessalonians, disappointment was complicated by mis-
interpretation. This also was the case with the Adventist pioneers of 1843-
1844. We can understand each generation's anxiety to be reunited with
their departed loved ones, to live in a world of peace and plenty, to inherit
everlasting life, and, most of all, to be eternally with Christ. We can under-
stand because we are propelled to hope by the same considerations.
   Our challenge today is the same as that of the generations before us—

      that of recognizing the signs and being stimulated to preparation without
      falling into either the fanaticism that demands fulfillment or the cynicism
      that questions God's Word.
          In this week's lesson, Paul reminds us not only of the necessity but of
      the practical implications involved in waiting for Christ to come.
sun   I. THE CAUTION REPEATED (2 Thess. 2:1, 2; 3:6).

      1. With what caution did Paul preface his outline of the signs of
         Christ's coming? 2 Thess. 2:1, 2.



         Timothy's report on his first visit to this church caused Paul to give the
      cautions regarding death and the delay that we find in 1 Thessalonians,
      chapters 4 and 5. Evidently the information provided in the first letter did
      not resolve the issue. This is evidenced by a number of statements in
      2 Thessalonians, notable among which is the clear warning with which
      Paul begins chapter 2.

      2. In what way does the language of 2 Thessalonians reveal a firmer
         attitude by Paul with respect to settling the believers' misap-
         prehensions? 2 Thess. 3:6.



         Whereas 1 Thessalonians is primarily thankful and laudatory in tone,
      2 Thessalonians is primarily corrective and authoritative. It is as though,
      having failed to accomplish his purpose or to settle the believers' mis-
      apprehensions in his first letter, Paul now resorts to more stern and ex-
      plicit discourse. This is mirrored in the fact that whereas he beseeches
      (1 Thess. 5:12) and exhorts (1 Thess. 5:14) and even charges (1 Thess.
      5:27) in the first letter, he not only beseeches and exhorts (2 Thess. 2:1
      and 3:12), but also commands repeatedly (2 Thess. 3:6, 10, 12) in the
      second. Close observation of 2 Thessalonians reveals a marked differ-
      ence in tone.

      11. THE PERIL OF DECEIT (2 Thess. 2:3, 10).

      3. What word often used by both Christ and Paul emphasizes the
         danger of wrong attitudes regarding the second coming of Christ?
         Matt. 24:4, 5, 11, 24; 2 Thess. 2:3, 10.



         Which is the harder trait to cure, the "fortress" mentality that re-
      sults in date setting, or the coldness and unconcern that eventually
      leads to the loss of love? Is one more of a problem to the church than
      the other? What are the best ways to help people who take extreme
      positions?

                                                                                 63

MON   4. Why do you think that the believers were urged to: (a) watch
         (Mark 13:35), (b) look up (Luke 21:28), and (c) be ready (Matt.
         24:42, 44) if the day of the Lord was not at hand?

      5. To what extreme conduct had the fanaticism of some of the Thes-
         salonian believers driven them? 2 Thess. 3:10, 11.



         While there are some among us today who also take an unhealthy posi-
      tion regarding the second coming of Christ, few go to the sad extreme of
      the believers in Thessalonica who actually left their jobs to wait. Some,
      however, may be guilty of unwise emphasis upon cataclysmic events.

         Do not run ahead of the Lord. "There is a time of trouble coming to
      the people of God, but we are not to keep that constantly before the people,
      and rein them up to have a time of trouble beforehand. There is to be a
      shaking among God's people; but this is not the present truth to carry to
      the churches. . . . Satan's object is accomplished just as surely when men
      run ahead of Christ and do the work He has never entrusted to their hands,
      as when they remain in the Laodicean state, lukewarm, feeling rich and in-
      creased with goods, and in need of nothing. The two classes are equally
      stumbling blocks."—Selected Messages, book 2, p. 13.

      6. While we cannot prove that Christ will come before we die, why is
         it impossible to place His coming beyond our death or any other
         future event? Acts 1:6, 7; Rom. 9:28; Matt. 24:36, 42, 44, 50.



      I11. THE BELIEVER'S CHALLENGE (2 Thess. 3:5).

      7. What warning given by Christ is repeated by Paul in the first
         Epistle? Mark 13:35-37; 1 Thess. 5:6.



      8. How does Paul instruct believers in regard to taking a correct at-
         titude toward Christ's second coming? 2 Thess. 3:5.



          Never has a generation been less susceptible to patience and waiting
      than ours. The people of many cultures today demand instant satisfaction
      and gratification. Modern technology and conveniences make waiting al-
      most obsolete. We have instant communications, instant travel, instant
      food, instant money, and, alas, even instant marriage and divorce. Waiting
      is contrary to the cultural orientation of many people. Our push-button age
      does not accommodate well the capacity for waiting. It takes a special spir-
      itual experience to obey God's command to wait.

9. What does "patiently waiting" imply for the righteous living?

    Luke 12:35, 36

    Luke 19:13

    1 Thess. 1:8-10

    2 Thess. 1:4

    2 Thess. 3:4, 5

   Waiting does not mean standing idly, impassively marking time.
Waiting includes "doing" (2 Thess. 3:4). It implies fighting courageously
in the valley while looking to the hills as a reminder that our help comes
from the Lord (Ps. 121:1, 2). Patience should not reduce enthusiasm; it im-
plies enthusiasm. Even though Paul faithfully admonished to patience, he
wisely amplified his counsel by saying, "Quench not the Spirit" (1 Thess.
5:19). The cold, lifeless formalism that typifies many congregations today
is not the lively waiting that Paul enjoins. "Patiently waiting" in Paul's
context is aggressively enduring. It is being so thrilled with the provisions,
the promises, and the prospects of salvation that we respond joyfully to
God's gracious love—when the Spirit inspires—by total commitment to
His purposes, and even saying "Amen" in church.

IV. THE INGREDIENTS OF PATIENCE (1 Thess. 5:8).

10. What Christian virtues are especially vital to patiently waiting?

    2 Thess. 1:3

    2 Thess. 2:16

    2 Thess. 3:5

11. In his letter to the Romans, what other virtue does the apostle
    mention as being tied to patience? Rom. 8:24, 25.



   A triad of virtues. Patience is undergirded by all three virtues so
prominent in Paul's writings. Faith connects us with God; it is our only
way of knowing Him. Love responds to what faith reveals. Furthermore, it
constrains us (2 Cor. 5:14); that is: (a) it clinches the arguments of belief,
(b) it controls the passions of the flesh, and (c) it impels us to share our
blessings with others. Meanwhile, hope, the attitude of confident expecta-
tion, gives us joyous consistency. Hope is not fulfillment—it is trust; it
understands that fulfillment alone will eradicate all doubt, but it weighs the
evidence and bases all its emotions, all its resources, all its present and fu-
ture plans, on the promises of God.

                                                                            65
       Lesson 9                                                     August 31
     12. With what familiar typology does Paul link the practical func-
         tions of these three virtues? 1 Thess. 5:8.



        Here Paul weds two images of which he is fond. The first is the mili-
     tary analogy that sees the Christian as a well-armed soldier. He uses this
     figure in Romans 13:12, 2 Corinthians 6:7, and 2 Corinthians 10:4. The
     second is the triad of virtues—faith, hope, and love. (See Rom. 5:2-5;
     1 Cor. 13:13; Gal. 5:5, 6; Heb. 6:10-12; compare 1 Peter 1:21, 22.) The
     specifics of the imagery Paul uses sometimes change. For instance, in
     Ephesians 6:16 faith is the shield; in 1 Thessalonians 5:8 faith is part of the
     breastplate. What seems to be important for Paul is not which armament
     represents which virtue, but that we are, in fact, adequately protected and
     fully armed.

        Why do you think that the armor Paul recommends in 1 Thes-
     salonians 5:8 includes defensive elements only?

     V. THE WAITING REMNANT (Rev. 14:12).

     13. In what way does John's description of the remnant reiterate and
         reinforce Paul's admonition? Rev. 14:12.



        John the revelator was inspired to comment on numerous occasions re-
     garding the role of patience (endurance) in the Christian experience. (See
     Rev. 1:9; 2:2, 3, 19; 3:10; 13:10.) While he sometimes rebukes God's
     people for lack of patience, it is encouraging to note that there are occa-
     sions on which he praises them for maintaining, and even growing in, this
     vital attribute. His emphasis upon patience as a premier characteristic of
     the waiting remnant supports Paul's admonition in this regard.

     14. How is patience developed? Rom. 5:3; James 1:3.



II 15. What religio-political movement now developing throughout the
        world signals the end of Christianity's long and patient wait?
        Matt. 24:15-21, 28.



        A sure sign. "By the decree enforcing the institution of the papacy in
     violation of the law of God, our nation [the United States] will disconnect
     herself fully from righteousness. When Protestantism shall stretch her hand
     across the gulf to grasp the hand of the Roman power, when she shall reach
     over the abyss to clasp hands with spiritualism, when, under the influence
     of this threefold union, our country shall repudiate every principle of its
     constitution as a Protestant and Republican government, and shall make
     66

provision for the propagation of papal falsehoods and delusions, then we
may know that the time has come for the marvelous working of Satan and
that the end is near.
   "As the approach of the Roman armies was a sign to the disciples of
the impending destruction of Jerusalem, so may this apostasy be a sign to
us that the limit of God's forbearance is reached, . . . and that the angel of
mercy is about to take her flight, never to return. The people of God will
then be plunged into those scenes of affliction and distress which prophets
have described as the time of Jacob's trouble."—Testimonies, vol. 5,
p. 451.

   What instances can you cite of recent interaction between the Vati-
can and various world powers that makes the fulfillment of this proph-
ecy plausible in our day?

16. Signs and fulfilling prophecies notwithstanding, what is the most
    basic of all incentives for obedience and service to God? Rom.
    8:35; compare John 15:9.



   An even higher motive. "The shortness of time is frequently urged as
an incentive for seeking righteousness and making Christ our friend. This
should not be the great motive with us; for it savors of selfishness. Is it
necessary that the terrors of the day of God should be held before us, that
we may be compelled to right action through fear? It ought not to be so.
Jesus is attractive. He is full of love, mercy, and compassion."—Signs of
the Times, March 17, 1887.

   Our lack of love delays the Advent. Two important thoughts must be
kept in mind: (1) The love of Christ is to be our primary reason for serving
Him—not reward or recompense at the Second Coming. (2) While each
generation has been disappointed with respect to Christ's coming, Christ
Himself is disappointed in our unreadiness for His coming. This is the real
reason for the present delay.
   "For forty years did unbelief, murmuring, and rebellion shut out an-
cient Israel from the land of Canaan. The same sins have delayed the en-
trance of modern Israel into the heavenly Canaan. In neither case were the
promises of God at fault. It is the unbelief, the worldliness, the unconsecra-
tion, and strife among the Lord's professed people that have kept us in this
world of sin and sorrow so many years."—Evangelism, p. 696.

   What percentage of the church do you think must be ready before
Jesus comes? Is there another more important variable that He is
seeking? Do you think it is possible for people who live in comparative
prosperity to maintain a dynamic, spiritual relationship with Christ?
If so, what are the key elements of the process?

PERSONAL RESPONSE:
  • Name two factors that influence the intensity of your desire for
    Christ's coming.
                                                                            67
  Lesson 9                                                   August 31
     • Give two reasons that you are willing to die waiting, if necessary,
       rather than to abandon faith in Jesus.
     • Give from memory, if you can, two promises of Jesus regarding His
       second coming.
     • Name two activities that you regularly perform that contribute
       directly to the finishing of God's work.
FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION:
   What Jesus says about our preparation for His coming: Luke 12:32-40;
21:7-36.
   What Paul says elsewhere: Romans 8:18-25; Heb. 6:1-12; 10:35-39.
   What Ellen White says: "The Lord intimates a delay before the morn-
ing finally dawns. But He would not have them give way to weariness, nor
relax their earnest watchfulness, because the morning does not open upon
them as soon as they expected."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 192.
   "I saw that it was impossible to have the affections and interests en-
grossed in worldly cares, to be increasing earthly possessions, and yet be in
a waiting, watching position, as our Saviour has commanded. Said the
angel, 'They can secure but one world. In order to acquire the heavenly
treasure, they must sacrifice the earthly. They cannot have both
worlds.' "—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 193.
   Also read Prophets and Kings, pp. 731-733; 386-391; Testimonies, vol.
4, pp. 186-199.

SUMMARY: Hope deferred is not hope lost. Our hope of meeting our
Saviour is the lodestar that focuses our efforts, giving meaning and direc-
tion to our lives. The life of the watching, waiting child of God may at
times seem difficult and unrewarding but, without doubt, it is more satisfy-
ing, more noble, more productive of good, than that which is generated by
any other ideology.

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Thessalonians 1:3; 4:7-12; 5:12-22.

SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "See that none render evil for evil unto any
PM    man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves,
      and to all men" (1 Thessalonians 5:15).

PAUL'S PRIMARY CONCERN. The doctrinal and prophetic emphasis
that we have studied in the two Thessalonian Epistles are important ele-
ments of Paul's communications to the vigorous young flock at Thessa-
lonica. However, his most distinctive instructions to the Thessalonians
were in the area of practical piety. This strong concern is common to both
Thessalonian Epistles. That which particularly occupied his attention was
their interpersonal relations, or the manner in which they treated one
another. There is no doubt that modern Christians need the same counsel
and for the same or similar reasons.

LESSON OUTLINE:
    I. A Faith That Works (1 Thess. 1:3).
   11. The Goal of Peace (1 Thess. 4:9, 10; 5:13).
  I11. Pathways to Peace (1 Thess. 4:11, 12).
  IV. The Necessity of Self-Control (1 Thess. 5:15, 22).
   V. Models of Church Order and Harmony (1 Thess. 2:11; 4:9).

THE REASON FOR PAUL'S CONCERN. It was true of Thessalonica,
as it has been true of every congregation in every age, that interpersonal re-
lationships form the severest test of discipleship. Paul knew that the Thes-
salonians' treatment of one another was the most tangible evidence of
Christian grace. He also knew that the quality of their relationship demon-
strated the quality of the Spirit's manifestation among them.
    There is no aspect of the Thessalonian admonitions more needed
today than this. It is needed in our smaller churches, where often one or
two individuals or families establish strong control, resulting in jealousy
and bitter rivalry; it is needed in larger churches, where depersonalization
and social cliques seem to manifest themselves; it is needed in the big ci-
ties, where larger congregations look down on smaller ones, and smaller

      ones call the larger ones selfish and worldly; and it is needed in our insti-
      tutional settings, where, in many cases, familiarity and intense competition
      for notice and resources breed rivalries, rumors, suspicions, stereotyping,
      and unholy politics so damaging to harmonious relations.

SUN   I. A FAITH THAT WORKS (1 Thess. 1:3).

      1. What spiritual qualities did Paul identify as especially active
         within the Thessalonian church?

           1 Thess. 1:3

           1 Thess. 1:8

           1 Thess. 3:6

           2 Thess. 1:4

        Several of the spiritual qualities mentioned above are cited more than
      once, but the quality most often mentioned by Paul is faith.

      2. What special concern of Paul had Timothy borne on his first trip
         back to Thessalonica? 1 Thess. 3:5.



         Paul's earnest desire was that the members love one another. One of
      the primary expressions of faith is love (Gal. 5:6). Before there can be
      love, there must be faith. Faith is the first rung in the ladder of Christian
      growth. It is to faith that we add virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience,
      godliness, brotherly kindness, and charity. (See 2 Peter 1:5-7.)

      11. THE GOAL OF PEACE (1 Thess. 4:9, 10; 5:13).

      3. How does Paul label the quality of relationship that he wishes their
         love experience to achieve? 1 Thess. 1:1, 2; 5:13.



         The desire of all believers. So strongly oriented is Paul in this direction
      that he might properly be called the apostle of peace. In none of his
      Epistles does he omit the mention of this treasured state. And he is not the
      only New Testament author with a strong orientation toward peace. Titus,
      James, Peter, Jude, and John the revelator join him in exalting peace as the
      prized state of Christian relations. Every New Testament Epistle with the
      exception of First John begins or ends with an injunction to peace.
         A few centuries after Paul, Augustine captured the early church's crav-
      ing for peace when he wrote: "And thus we may say of peace, as we have
      said of eternal life, that it is the end of our good; and the rather because the
      Psalmist says . . . 'Praise the Lord, 0 Jerusalem; praise thy God, 0 Zion:
      for He hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; He hath blessed thy children
      70
       Living Together Harmoniously                             September 7
      within thee; who hath made thy borders peace.' . . . For peace is a good so
      great, that even in this earthly and mortal life there is no word we hear with
      such pleasure, nothing we desire with such zest, or find to be more
      thoroughly gratifying."—Augustine, The City of God (New York: Modern
      Library, 1983), p. 686.

        What reasons can you give to support the appropriateness of
      Christ's title, Prince of Peace?

MON   4. What is the opposite of peace? 1 Cor. 14:33.



         God is the author of our faith that works by love and establishes peace.
      Satan is the author of confusion and rejoices greatly when the church of
      God is torn by dissension, splintered by animosities, traumatized by mis-
      understanding, titillated by gossip, and rent by hostilities. The church's
      power quotient is directly proportionate to its level of peace. At Pentecost
      the members were at peace with one another—they were all at one place of
      one accord. (See Acts 2:1.)

        Why must we have peace with ourselves before we can have peace
      with others? What is the secret to remaining peaceful in the midst of
      controversy?

      5. What priority does Paul suggest we follow with respect to Chris-
         tian charity?

         Gal. 6:10

         1 Thess. 4:9, 10

         1 Thess. 3:12

       Why do bitterness and hostility sometimes exist within the church?
      What can be done to defuse these tensions?

      I11. PATHWAYS TO PEACE (1 Thess. 4:11, 12).

      6. What three practical recommendations for augmenting peace does
         Paul make in chapter four? 1 Thess. 4:11.



          Counsel for busybodies. It would be difficult to raise one of these pre-
      requisites for peace above the others. The New International Version trans-
      lates: "Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life" (1 Thess. 4:11). We are
      admonished to be calm, not excitable or agitated by every wind of gossip,
      trial, or disappointment.
          "To do your own business" means to cease taking undue interest in or
      concern for the private affairs of others. We are our brothers' helpers, but
                                                                                  71
      Lesson 10                                                 September 7
    not necessarily their advisors or their counselors, and certainly not their
    judges, their prosecutors, or their superiors in value before God. Paul's
    counsel is an injunction against meddlesomeness.
       "Work with your own hands" is a reminder of the dignity of labor and
    the shame of depending upon others—even the benevolent society of
    believers—when we have the opportunity and capacity to do what we can
    for ourselves.

     7. In addition to the peaceful results that such attitudes and actions
        will bring the church, what other effects will accrue? 1 Thess.
        4:12.



        Is it true that obedient Christians will never lack material necessi-
     ties? Under what circumstances might they lack? What is the church's
     responsibility in such cases? Does your church have an effective pro-
     gram for addressing such eventualities? If not, why not set one in mo-
     tion now?

11 8. What activity common in church circles especially damages
       peace? Prov. 26:20-22; James 3:2-6.



        Source of most conflicts within the church. "Gossipers and news car-
     riers are a terrible curse to neighborhoods and churches. Two thirds of all
     the church trials arise from this source."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 466.
        "All dissension, all differences and faultfinding, should be put away,
     with all evil speaking and bitterness; kindness, love, and compassion for
     one another should be cherished, that the prayer of Christ that His disciples
     might be one as He is one with the Father, may be answered. The harmony
     and unity of the church are the credentials that they present to the world
     that Jesus is the Son of God. Genuine conversion will ever lead to genuine
     love for Jesus and for all those for whom He died."—Testimonies, vol. 5,
     p. 279.

     IV. THE NECESSITY OF SELF-CONTROL (1 Thess. 5:15, 22).

     9. What other primary principle of peaceful relatIons introduced by
        Jesus does Paul urge? Matt. 5:38-42; 1 Thess. 5:15.



        Absorbing and reducing anger. "Do not retaliate. So far as you can
     do so, remove all cause for misapprehension. Avoid the appearance of evil.
     Do all that lies in your power, without the sacrifice of principle, to concili-
     ate others. . . .
        "If impatient words are spoken to you, never reply in the same spirit.
     Remember that a 'soft answer turneth away wrath.' Proverbs 15:1. And
     there is wonderful power in silence. Words spoken in reply to one who is
     72
       Living Together Harmoniously                           September 7
      angry sometimes serve only to exasperate. But anger met with silence, in a
      tender, forbearing spirit, quickly dies away."—The Ministry of Healing,
      p. 486.

         Forgiveness, not revenge. According to some social psychologists, re-
      venge is the most natural and instinctive of vices. Whether that is true or
      not, we know it is common and hard to cure. The Christian way is not one
      of revenge; it is the way of forgiveness. A minister, powerful in preaching
      the Word, once spoke on the subject "Jesus at His Best." In his sermon he
      pointed out that Jesus was great when stilling the ocean, when casting out
      demons, when healing broken bodies, and when turning water into wine,
      but that He was at His best or greatest when on the cross He cried,
      "Father, forgive them."

         Is there an individual or a family in your church fellowship with
      whom you need to talk over a painful injury or misunderstanding? If
      so, is this not a good time to do so?

WED   10. What consideration for peace so often ignored does Paul solemnly
          advance? 1 Thess. 5:22. What point of view is crucial to under-
          standing and following this advice?



         A sense of "corporate responsibility" is critical for following this
      advice. Church members who act without assuming obligation to the cor-
      porate body are an unfailing source of tensions. Membership has its privi-
      leges, but it also has its responsibilities—one of which is to speak and act
      in ways that are best suited to foster peace and understanding within the
      body. Individuals who function from the premise that their personal free-
      doms and interests supersede or are separate from the good of the whole
      are not helpful to peaceful relationships within the church.

      11. Against what unacceptable manner of making peace does Jesus
          warn? Matt. 10:34-38.



          Peace by compromise. "Jesus Himself never purchased peace by com-
      promise. His heart overflowed with love for the whole human race, but He
      was never indulgent to their sins. He was too much their friend to remain
      silent while they were pursuing a course that would ruin their souls—the
      souls He had purchased with His own blood. He labored that man should
      be true to himself, true to his higher and eternal interest. The servants of
      Christ are called to the same work, and they should beware lest, in seeking
      to prevent discord, they surrender the truth. They are to 'follow after the
      things which make for peace;' but real peace can never be secured by com-
      promising principle. And no man can be true to principle without exciting
      opposition. A Christianity that is spiritual will be opposed by the children
      of disobedience. But Jesus bade His disciples, 'Fear not them which kill
      the body, but are not able to kill the soul.' Those who are true to God need
                                                                               73
        Lesson 10                                               September 7
      not fear the power of men nor the enmity of Satan. In Christ their eternal
      life is secure. Their only fear should be lest they surrender the truth, and
      thus betray the trust with which God has honored them."—The Desire of
      Ages, p. 356.

      V. MODELS OF CHURCH ORDER AND HARMONY (1 Thess.
iii      2:11; 4:9).

      12. What fundamental institution of society provides Paul's working
          model of church relations? 1 Thess. 2:11; 4:9; Eph. 3:15.



         Brothers and sisters support one another. The church is likened to a
      number of things in the Word of God. Among the more prominent are: a
      house (Isa. 56:7), a city (Psalm 48; Matt. 5:14), a woman (Rev. 12:1), a na-
      tion (1 Peter 2:9), a priesthood (1 Peter 2:9), and an army (Song of Solo-
      mon 6:4). But the comparison probably most familiar to Bible believers is
      the church likened to the family. It is a family in which God is the Father
      and Jesus is the elder Brother by whose efforts we are all adopted and
      made children and heirs.
         But we are not just children. We are brothers and sisters. In the two
      Thessalonian Epistles Paul addresses the believers in terms of brotherly or
      sibling relations no less than 26 times. The choice of the family model as
      a type of our interpersonal relationships is clear—under God we are one
      unitary whole and are admonished to protect, encourage, help, forgive,
      love, and cherish one another as do the children of homes where love has
      forged bonds that are stronger than death.

      13. What other instructive model does Paul often use to demonstrate
          church harmony and cooperation? 1 Cor. 12:12-14; Eph. 4:16.



         A unit symmetrical and sanctified. "By a comparison of the church
      with the human body, the apostle aptly illustrated the close and har-
      monious relationship that should exist among all members of the church of
      Christ."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 317.
         "As all the different members of the human system unite to form the
      entire body, and each performs its office in obedience to the intelligence
      that governs the whole, so the members of the church of Christ should be
      united in one symmetrical body, subject to the sanctified intelligence of the
      whole."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 16.

         Think it through. What is the difference between unity and uniform-
      ity? What are some areas of church and family life in which members
      should expect or tolerate unity in diversity?

      14. How did the apostle later summarize his desires for the members
          in the area of interpersonal relations? 1 Cor. 14:40.

      74
       Living Together Harmoniously                            September 7
         A heavenly example. "Angels work harmoniously. Perfect order
      characterizes all their movements. The more closely we imitate the har-
      mony and order of the angelic host, the more successful will be the efforts
      of these heavenly agents in our behalf. If we see no necessity for har-
      monious action, and are disorderly, undisciplined, and disorganized in our
      course of action, angels, who are thoroughly organized and move in per-
      fect order, cannot work for us successfully. They turn away in grief, for
      they are not authorized to bless confusion, distraction, and disorganiza-
      tion."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 28.
      PERSONAL RESPONSE. On a scale of one to five rate the following
      considerations (five being the maximum):
                  The level of harmony in my church (congregation).
                  My recent contributions toward harmony in my church
                  (congregation).
                  The level of harmony in my home.
                  My recent contributions toward harmony in my home.
                  The level of harmony in my work situation.
                  My recent contributions toward harmony at work.
                  My present willingness, by the grace of God, to contribute
                  more effectively toward harmony.

FRI   FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION:
         What Jesus said about peace among His followers: Mark 9:50; John
      14:27.
         What Paul said elsewhere: Rom. 12:9-21; 14:17; 2 Cor. 13:11; Col.
      3:12-15; 2 Tim. 2:22.
         What Ellen White said: "The church of Christ may be fitly compared to
      an army. . . . Unless the members of the church are active and vigilant,
      they will be overcome by his [Satan's] devices."—Testimonies, vol. 5,
      p. 394.
         "God's servants are to work together, blending in kindly, courteous
      order, 'in honour preferring one another.' Romans 12:10. There is to be no
      unkind criticism, no pulling to pieces of another's work; and there are to be
      no separate parties."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 275.
         Also read Testimonies, vol. 3, pp. 434-455.

      SUMMARY: The most effective means of dissipating the church's wit-
      ness is strife and dissension within its ranks. On the other hand, the most
      powerful proof of the church's claims is its demonstration of loving, har-
      monious interaction within the framework of Christ's instructions.

September 8-14


       Church Authority and
            Discipline
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Thessalonians 5:5-14; 2 Thessalonians 3:6-
18.

SAB    MEMORY TEXT: "And if any man obey not our word by this
PM     epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he
       may be ashamed" (2 Thessalonians 3:14).

ON PREDICTABILITY, RELIABILITY, AND COMPATIBILITY.
God's physical realm, the universe, functions in accordance with laws that
are predictable, reliable, and compatible. It is His divine will that His spir-
itual realm, the church, be guided by similar rules of authority and disci-
pline.

LESSON OUTLINE:
    I. Church Organization and Authority (2 Thess. 3:14).
   11. The Causes for Discipline (1 Thess. 5:14).
 I11. The Purpose of Discipline (Gal. 5:9).
  IV. The Process of Discipline (2 Thess. 3:6, 14).
   V. Attitudes Essential to Church Authority and Discipline
       (1 Thess. 5:12, 13).

AN UNMISTAKABLE EMPHASIS. Paul opens both the Thessalonian
Epistles with general greetings, which provide valuable insights for those
studying the historical and spiritual import of his thought. The fact is that
we see little difference in his salutations to the Thessalonians and those
given to the Corinthians, the Galatians, or the Ephesians. The same can be
said of the closing, or signature, of each letter. That which states most
strongly his specific wishes for the group's spiritual progress in many
cases is summarized succinctly in the last chapters of the Epistle.
    Instruction regarding church authority. In both of the Thessalonian
Epistles, Paul's forthright instructions regarding church authority and dis-
cipline fit into this scheme. He leaves no doubt of the need for this coun-
sel. In Thessalonica a number of the members were flaunting church
authority in the name of personal freedom and special revelation. Paul's
letter met this situation "head on." He does not mince words. If it is to

prosper in its witness for truth, the church must confront and if necessary
dismiss those who ignore counsel and defy duly constituted church author-
ity.

I. CHURCH ORGANIZATION AND AUTHORITY (2 Thess. 3:14).

1. What ultimate authority should guide the church in structuring its
   rules and regulations? 1 Thess. 1:6; 2:13; 2 Thess. 3:14.



  Is it reasonable to expect that principles and forms given 2,000
years ago and earlier can serve as accurate guides for church rules
and regulations today? If so, why?

2. By what process did the apostolic church decide upon its organiza-
   tional structure? Acts 6:2-6.



3. What similar pattern was followed in outlining doctrine and dis-
   cipline? Acts 15:1-6.



    Like a mighty army. "The order that was maintained in the early
Christian church, made it possible for them to move forward solidly as a
well-disciplined army clad with the armor of God. The companies of
believers, though scattered over a large territory, were all members of one
body; all moved in concert and in harmony with one another."—The Acts
of the Apostles, pp. 95, 96.

   The Adventist pioneers were led to organize. "As our numbers in-
creased, it was evident that without some form of organization there would
be great confusion, and the work would not be carried forward success-
fully. To provide for the support of the ministry, for carrying the work in
new fields, for protecting both the churches and the ministry from unwor-
thy members, for holding church property, for the publication of the truth
through the press, and for many other objects, organization was indis-
pensable. . . .
   "We had a hard struggle in establishing organization. Notwithstanding
that the Lord gave testimony after testimony upon this point, the opposi-
tion was strong, and it had to be met again and again. But we knew that the
Lord God of Israel was leading us, and guiding by His providence. We en-
gaged in the work of organization, and marked prosperity attended this ad-
vance movement."—Testimonies to Ministers, pp. 26, 27.

11. THE CAUSES FOR DISCIPLINE (1 Thess. 5:14).

4. How does Paul characterize those persons whose conduct is dis-
   ruptive to church order and authority?
                                                                         77

           1 Thess. 5:14

           2 Thess. 3:6

           2 Thess. 3:11

      5. Against what other kinds of harmful people does Paul warn? Titus
         3:9-11; 1 Cor. 5:9-11.



          The specific reasons for discipline held by the Seventh-day Adven-
      tist Church are listed in the Church Manual. A summary is as follows:
          a. Denial of faith in the fundamentals of the gospel.
          b. Open violation of the law of God.
          c. Fraud or willful misrepresentation in business.
          d. Disorderly conduct that brings reproach upon the church.
          e. Adhering to or taking part in a divisive or disloyal movement or or-
             ganization.
          f. Persistent refusal to recognize properly constituted authority or sub-
             mit to order or discipline of the church.
          g. The use, manufacture, or sale of alcoholic beverages.
          h. The use of tobacco.
          i. The misuse of, or trafficking in, narcotics or other drugs.

MON   I11. THE PURPOSE OF DISCIPLINE (Gal. 5:9).

      6. Why should the church be concerned about addressing problems
         of behavior among the members?

           Gal. 5:9

           Gal. 6:1

           1 Cor. 5:6, 7

           James 5:20

         Call sin by its right name. "But on the church in its organized capac-
      ity He [Christ] places a responsibility for the individual members. Toward
      those who fall into sin, the church has a duty, to warn, to instruct, and if
      possible to restore. 'Reprove, rebuke, exhort,' the Lord says, 'with all
      long-suffering and doctrine.' 2 Tim. 4:2. Deal faithfully with wrongdoing.
      Warn every soul that is in danger. Leave none to deceive themselves. Call
      sin by its right name. Declare what God has said in regard to lying, Sab-
      bathbreaking, stealing, idolatry, and every other evil."—The Desire of
      Ages, pp. 805, 806.
          "If there were no church discipline and government, the church would
      go to fragments; it could not hold together as a body. There have ever been
      individuals of independent minds, who have claimed that they were right,
      that God had especially taught, impressed, and led them. Each has a theory
      78
 Church Authority and Discipline                        September 14
of his own, views peculiar to himself, and each claims that his views are in
accordance with the word of God. Each one has a different theory and
faith, yet each claims special light from God. These draw away from the
body, and each one is a separate church of himself."—Testimonies, vol. 3,
pp. 428, 429.

7. How does Paul's personal conversion experience demonstrate the
    value of church authority? Acts 9:10-18.



   Jesus chose the authorities of the church, whom He led to recognize
Paul's special call. Paul was made aware that human authority in the
church is subordinate to and directed by the authority of the Lord Himself.
In his later ministry, Paul was willing to submit his opinions and plans to
duly constituted church authority because he recognized the appointed
leaders of the church as the instruments of Christ's will. (See Acts 15:2;
Gal. 2:2; The Acts of the Apostles, p. 122.)

IV. THE PROCESS OF DISCIPLINE (2 Thess. 3:6, 14).

8. What provisions did Jesus make for the disciplinary process of
    the organized church? Matt. 16:18, 19.



   In Christ's stead. "On the church has been conferred the power to act
in Christ's stead. It is God's instrumentality for the preservation of order
and discipline among His people. To it the Lord has delegated the power
to settle all questions respecting its prosperity, purity, and order. Upon it
rests the responsibility of excluding from its fellowship those who are un-
worthy, who by their unchristlike conduct would bring dishonor on the
truth. Whatever the church does that is in accordance with the directions
given in God's word, will be ratified in heaven."—Gospel Workers, pp.
501, 502.

9. What initial step does Paul recommend be taken in dealing with
    disorderly or unruly persons? 1 Thess. 5:14.



   The first step. "Speaking alone and in the spirit of Christ to the one
who is in fault will often remove the difficulty. Go to the erring one, with
a heart filled with Christ's love and sympathy, and seek to adjust the mat-
ter. Reason with him calmly and quietly. Let no angry words escape your
lips. Speak in a way that will appeal to his better judgment."—Testimo-
nies, vol. 7, p. 261.

10. What ultimate course of action is sometimes required? 2 Thess.
    3:6, 14; 1 Cor. 5:2, 9-13.

                                                                          79
 Lesson 11                                              September 14
   Painful but necessary. "Sin and sinners in the church must be
promptly dealt with, that others may not be contaminated. Truth and purity
require that we make more thorough work to cleanse the camp from
Achans. Let those in responsible positions not suffer sin in a brother. Show
him that he must either put away his sins or be separated from the
church."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 147.

    The two main forms of discipline in the Seventh-day Adventist
Church are censure (involving a period of probation) and disfellowship-
ing. Censure is the disciplinary measure imposed by the church that recog-
nizes grievous misdeeds on the part of the member, but that allows the in-
dividual to maintain membership. It is hoped that during this period the
individual will come nearer to the Lord, take time to think through the
issue, and correct the mistake. The period, determined by the church, is
usually from six months to a year in duration, and, if all goes well, when it
is over the individual is restored to full fellowship without further vote.
    The other, more drastic, form of discipline, disfellowshiping, is applied
when acts are so grievous that the body believes it necessary to sever the
individual from church membership. In no case should discipline—either
censure or dismissal—be made such as to appear punitive. The aim is to
lead a sinner to repentance in a spirit of Christian love, forgiveness, and
understanding.

   Why does God not give to private groups of members the task of
correcting or purifying the church?

11. Who alone has the power to decide matters of church discipline?
    Matt. 18:17.



   The church board recommends; the church acts. " 'And if he
shall neglect to hear them,' what then shall be done? Shall a few per-
sons in a board meeting take upon themselves the responsibility of dis-
fellowshiping the erring one? 'If he shall neglect to hear them, tell it
unto the church.' . . . Let the church take action in regard to its mem-
bers."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 262.

V. ATTITUDES ESSENTIAL TO CHURCH AUTHORITY AND
    DISCIPLINE (1 Thess. 5:12, 13).

12. What is to be our attitude toward individuals in the following
    categories?

     a. Persons being considered for discipline. (See James 5:19, 20.)



   Justice and mercy. "Love and tenderness, patience and self-control,
will at all times be the law of their speech. Mercy and compassion will be
blended with justice. When it is necessary to give reproof, their language
80
 Church Authority and Discipline                            September 14
will not be exaggerated, but humble. In gentleness they will set before the
wrongdoer his errors and help him to recover himself. Every true teacher
will feel that should he err at all, it is better to err on the side of mercy than
on the side of severity."—Education, pp. 293, 294.

    b. Persons who have been disfellowshiped or who are currently under
       censure. (See 2 Thess. 3:14, 15.)



    c. Persons who have been disfellowshiped and who wish restoration
       to the body of believers. (See Gal. 6:1, 2.)



   Giving another chance. "If the erring one repents and submits to
Christ's discipline, he is to be given another trial. And even if he does not
repent, even if he stands outside the church, God's servants still have a
work to do for him. They are to seek earnestly to win him to repentance.
And, however aggravated may have been his offense, if he yields to the
striving of the Holy Spirit and, by confessing and forsaking his sin, gives
evidence of repentance, he is to be forgiven and welcomed to the fold
again."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 263.

13. What should be the attitude of the believers toward members
    who live worldly lives but who commit no offense worthy of dis-
    cipline? Matt. 13:30.



    Dealing with the tares. "Those who are carnally minded will be found
in the church. They are to be pitied more than blamed. The church is not to
be judged as sustaining these characters, though they be found within her
borders. Should the church expel them, the very ones who found fault with
their presence there, would blame the church for sending them adrift in the
world; they would claim that they were treated unmercifully."—Fun-
damentals of Christian Education, p. 294.

14. What did Paul say should be the attitude of the members toward
    those chiefly responsible for interpreting and applying church
    rules and policies? 1 Thess. 5:12, 13.



   Two specific postures toward church leaders are recommended
by Paul: (a) know them (verse 12), and (b) esteem them highly in love
(verse 13). Both attitudes of members toward leaders are essential to
church order and discipline. "Knowing the leaders" means to appreciate
fully or understand their worth and responsibility. To "esteem them
highly" goes beyond that. The leaders are not to be simply respected
for their position, or given deference as the cold voice of authority.
                                                                                81
       Lesson 11                                               September 14
      They are to be genuinely appreciated and loved.
         By their godly lives and their devoted service to God and the church,
      leaders should merit the respect and the full support of the membership.
         The adversarial relationship between leaders and laity so often seen in
      modem congregations and institutions is highly disruptive to church order
      and discipline.

      15. How does Paul remind church leaders of their obligation to strive
          for harmony between themselves and the believers? 1 Thess. 4:9;
          Acts 20:18-21, 27, 28.



      PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS.
        • While all persons in the church are equal in terms of soul worth,
          some occupy positions in which God has placed special authority.
          True / / False / /
        • Respect for authority is more easily maintained in our generation
          than in prior times. True / / False / /
        • Many children are turned away from the church and religion as a
          result of their parents' conversations regarding church leadership
          and church affairs. True / / False / /
FRI   FURTHER MEDITATION AND STUDY:
         What Jesus says about church authority: Matt. 18:15-17; John 20:22,
      23.
         What Paul says elsewhere: 2 Cor. 6:14-18; Eph. 5:6-13, 23-27; Titus
      3:8-11.
         What Ellen White says: "If one neglects the duty Christ has enjoined, of
      trying to restore those who are in error and sin, he becomes a partaker in
      the sin. For evils that we might have checked, we are just as responsible as
      if we were guilty of the acts ourselves."—The Desire of Ages, p. 441.
         "The church, enfeebled and defective, needing to be reproved, warned,
      and counseled, is the only object upon earth upon which Christ bestows
      His supreme regard."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 49.
         "As we near the final crisis, instead of feeling that there is less need of
      order and harmony of action, we should be more systematic than here-
      tofore."—Selected Messages, book 3, p. 26.

      SUMMARY: The church is not just another institution in society; it is en-
      dowed with supernatural powers and authority. Its members and leaders
      are human, but its mandate and mission are divine.

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Thessalonians 1:1-9; 2:1-20; 2 Thessalo-
nians 3:1-9.

      only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much as-
      surance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you
      for your sake" (1 Thessalonians 1:5).
THE GOSPEL MUST BE LIVED, NOT SIMPLY VERBALIZED.
Paul's experience in Thessalonica demonstrates clearly how a good ex-
ample strengthens and verifies the witness of the spoken word. Paul's ex-
ample illustrates what every Christian should be—a revelation of God to
the world. Because the Thessalonians followed his example by committing
all to Christ and witnessing for Him, they too became examples to fellow
believers in other centers.

   11. Paul's Example of Industry (1 Thess. 2:9).

LIVING THE GOSPEL. It is true that a good sermon is truth flowing
from the lips of a good person. This thought is brought home forcibly
when we observe that the Thessalonian Epistles record not just Paul's
various admonitions but also sketches of a life that gave credence and ef-
fectiveness to his preaching. Paul not only told the Thessalonians how to
live but he also showed them how. He led by example. Of course, Paul
well understood that Christ was the only perfect example. He often
confessed, as in Philippians 3:13, 14, that God was not through with him
yet. But he nevertheless enjoyed a rich, surrendered, progressive ex-
perience with Christ, and he was not shy about using his victorious spir-
itual experiences as a means of strengthening the resolve of those for
whom he labored.

   Paul's example. In his letter to the Thessalonians, more than in any
other letter, Paul points confidently to his life among the people as proof of
his sincerity and as an example of God's power to save. That is not pride
or egotism. It was his way of encouraging the believers with a testimony
that they could readily remember and understand. By reminding them of
his exemplary life in their midst, Paul adds living example to idealistic
theory. That, of course, is the ultimate witness for the child of God.

I. THE POWER OF EXAMPLE (1 Thess. 1:6-8).

1. What is unusual about the order of gospel influence mentioned by
   Paul in addressing the Thessalonian church? What influence did
   he and his associates have upon the Thessalonians? 1 Thess. 1:6;
   compare 1 Cor. 11:1.



   The mention of the human agent before the Divine example. The
Thessalonians became imitators of Paul because he was an imitator of
Christ. Our listeners form impressions about us before they form impres-
sions about what or whom we represent. What truly stands out here is that
Paul recognized that the Holy Spirit's presence and power were function-
ally tied to the quality of his personal life.

    Sermons we see. The word followers may be translated "imitators."
As the converts left their former beliefs and rituals they were oriented to
the lifestyle of Christianity by imitating Paul and his team in such matters
as diet, speech, dress, and demeanor. Influence is a talent that all possess.
It is especially important in soul-saving—as we work for our children, our
neighbors, or persons attending an evangelistic meeting or a Bible study.
Each student or observer of humanity may truthfully say in his or her heart:
    "I'd rather see a sermon than hear one any day;
    I'd rather one should walk with me than merely tell the way.
    The eye's a better pupil and more willing than the ear,
    Fine counsel is confusing, but example's always clear;
    And the best of all the preachers are the men who live their creeds,
    For to see good put in action is what everybody needs."—Edgar A.
Guest, Collected Verse of Edgar A. Guest (1934), pp. 599, 600.

2. How does Paul characterize the quality of his living during his
   ministry in Thessalonica? 1 Thess. 2:10.



   There was no hesitation, no equivocation; Paul had enjoyed a scandal-
free ministry in Thessalonica. However, his ministry was not simply free
from reproach; it was characterized by healthy contributions of a com-
mitted, energetic, sacrificial life.

   "Paul carried with him the atmosphere of heaven. All who as-
sociated with him felt the influence of his union with Christ. The fact that
84
       Paul's Godly Example                                 September 21
      his own life exemplified the truth he proclaimed, gave convincing power
      to his preaching. Here lies the power of truth. The unstudied, unconscious
      influence of a holy life is the most convincing sermon that can be given in
      favor of Christianity. Argument, even when unanswerable, may provoke
      only opposition; but a godly example has a power that it is impossible
      wholly to resist."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 510, 511.

      3. How did Paul's influence upon the Thessalonians reproduce itself
         in their witness? 1 Thess. 1:7, 8.



         The word example is the Greek word tupos, from which is derived our
      word type. The Greek word means "visible impression," "copy,"
      "image," "pattern," "model."
         As model Christians, the Thessalonian believers provided an example to
      the converts in Macedonia and Greece. As others became aware of their
      sacrifice and piety they were moved to come closer to Christ and to remain
      true to the principles of the gospel.
         "We need not suppose that all the Thessalonians were preachers in the
      ordinary sense of the word. Some of them no doubt were. But the Acts of
      the Apostles gives us glimpses of the life of the early church and what was
      done in one place by aroused and determined men may well have been
      done in another. A vibrant and living faith could not be silent."—Ronald
      A. Ward, Commentary on 1 & 2 Thessalonians (Waco, Texas: Word
      Books, 1973), p. 39.

         Can you cite examples of new believers in your church who have
      become effective witnesses for Christ? What impact has their love and
      enthusiasm had upon the church as a whole?

MON   11. PAUL'S EXAMPLE OF INDUSTRY (1 Thess. 2:9).

      4. What feature of his stay in Thessalonica did Paul repeatedly men-
         tion? 1 Thess. 2:9; 2 Thess. 3:7, 8.



         The system of ministerial support in Paul's day was not identical to
      ours. The tithe was used to assist in the support of the priesthood in Old
      Testament times. But many preachers and teachers of New Testament
      times, especially itinerant evangelists such as Paul, used their hands as
      their primary means of support.
         Paul did this to avoid criticism from those whom he was endeavoring to
      win to Christ, even though he taught that the ministry should be supported
      from the tithe. (See 1 Cor. 9:9-15.)

      5. What was one of the main reasons for Paul's self-supporting ef-
         forts at Thessalonica? 2 Thess. 3:8, 9.


                                                                               85
       Lesson 12                                            September 21
        Paul not only ate and drank in a manner consistent with his teachings;
     he was ethically upright. He respected the rights and personhood of others.
     If anything, he went overboard in refusing to take advantage of others,
     going so far as to waive his God-given right of remuneration. Instead, he
     earned a living with his own hands.

     6. Based upon his own example, what counsel did Paul give regard-
        ing the indolent? 2 Thess. 3:10.



    I11. PAUL'S EXAMPLE OF GRATITUDE (1 Thess. 1:2, 7-9).
111 7. For what was Paul particularly grateful?
          1 Thess. 1:7-9

          1 Thess. 2:13

          2 Thess. 2:13

     8. How frequently did the apostle express gratitude to God? 1 Thess.
        1:2; 2 Thess. 2:13.



         Note that Paul gives thanks to God for all the church. Each member is
     loved, remembered, and probably also mentioned by name in his daily
     prayers. Every one is treasured as a precious gift of God, and each is
     appreciated for the gifts that he or she has to contribute to the church and
     to the community.

     9. For what does Paul say the Thessalonians should be thankful?
        1 Thess. 5:18.



        Be continually grateful. We may have extreme difficulty in under-
     standing the Scriptures to mean, "Be thankful for tragedies, losses, and
     disappointments." That probably is not what Paul meant. What he in-
     tended was that they should maintain the spirit of gratitude, being hopeful
     no matter what the circumstances. Their knowledge that, however un-
     pleasant the conditions of their lives, God was working His purposes for
     the world, the church, and for them, should lead them to rejoice. They
     could be continually grateful in the knowledge that God understands, God
     sees, God knows, and that sometimes He uses even unpleasantness to
     glorify His name and to work out His divine purposes. (See Phil. 4:11;
     Rom. 8:28.) Thanks is also to be directed to God in prayer for His precious
     gifts. In this Paul practiced what he preached.

          It is God's will that we give thanks. Why? Because gratitude fosters
     86
       Paul's Godly Example                                     September 21
      good cheer and good health. (See 3 John 2.)
         "Nothing tends more to promote health of body and of soul than does a
      spirit of gratitude and praise. It is a positive duty to resist melancholy, dis-
      contented thoughts and feelings—as much a duty as it is to pray. If we are
      heaven-bound, how can we go as a band of mourners, groaning and com-
      plaining all along the way to our Father's house?
         "Those professed Christians who are constantly complaining, and who
      seem to think cheerfulness and happiness a sin, have not genuine re-
      ligion."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 251.

          If we cannot be grateful for what happened, we should be grateful
      for what did not happen. Can you cite examples of this thought in your
      life?
WED   IV. PAUL'S EXAMPLE OF SINCERITY (1 Thess. 2:3, 4).
      10. In reminding the Thessalonians of his manner among them, what
          supreme objective of his service does Paul emphasize? 1 Thess.
          2:3, 4.


         Paul did not have hidden agendas. His only aim was to please God.
      He was not laboring for material reward, for selfish satisfaction, nor, as he
      emphasizes repeatedly, for human applause or approbation. He had
      reached the pinnacle of freedom. He cared so much about God's approba-
      tion that human praise meant nothing to him.
         The word guile, meaning "subtlety" or "craftiness" (1 Thess. 2:3),
      is often used in the Bible to typify deceit or insincerity. What New
      Testament life do you regard as the supreme example of one without
      guile? Why?

      11. How important is sincerity to our acceptance by God? Rev. 14:5;
          1 Peter 2:1-3.


      12. Against what manifestation of insincerity did Jesus warn? Who
          were the classic examples that He mentions? Luke 12:1; Matt.
          23:1-7.


      13. What is the most observable manifestation of sincerity? Matt.
          7:18-20; 2 Thess. 3:4, 13, 14.



         Faith and works. "When it is in the heart to obey God, when efforts
      are put forth to this end, Jesus accepts this disposition and effort as man's
                                                                                87
  Lesson 12                                             September 21
best service, and He makes up for the deficiency with His own divine
merit. But He will not accept those who claim to have faith in Him, and yet
are disloyal to His Father's commandment. We hear a great deal about
faith, but we need to hear a great deal more about works. Many are deceiv-
ing their own souls by living an easy-going, accommodating, crossless re-
ligion. But Jesus says, 'If any man will come after me, let him deny him-
self, and take up his cross, and follow me.' "—Selected Messages, book 1,
p. 382.

V. PAUL'S EXAMPLE OF HUMILITY (1 Thess. 2:1-20).

14. Paul frequently uses the first-person plural pronouns we, our, us
    in his address to the Thessalonians. What does this reveal about
    his attitude toward his fellow workers? 1 Thess. 2:1-20.



    Paul shared the credit. Instead of our, we, and us, the great apostle
could have said, mine, me, and I. After all, he was the leading evangelist—
"the boss," we would say today. But not so; Paul was not concerned about
the "pecking order." At the end of 2 Thessalonians he confirmed that he,
himself, had written the letter. (See 2 Thess. 3:17.) But throughout the
Epistles, he shared the credit. He did not seek for self-exaltation. His was
no false or affected meekness. He was not "proud of his humility." He
even risked being misunderstood by recounting the drama of his personal
life. But his aims are clear—he wished only to exalt his Lord. And when
God blessed his sacrificial labors, he was happy to share the credit with his
young helpers Timothy and Sylvanus.
     Compare Paul's attitude with that of Christ referred to in Philippians
2:6.

15. What request did Paul make of the membership that reflects fur-
    ther his Christ-like humility? 2 Thess. 3:1, 2.



   Paul's frequent request. "Paul was a very great apostle, but his great-
ness consisted not so much in sheer native ability (although he had his
share of that) as in his recognition of his dependence upon God. It arises
out of this that he so often requests the prayers of those to whom he min-
isters. He did not feel himself as high above them, but as one with them.
He valued their intercessions and sought their prayers."—Leon Morris,
New International Commentary on the New Testament (Grand Rapids,
Mich.: Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1973), p. 244.

16. What additional evidence can we find of Paul's humble attitude?
    1 Cor. 15:9; Eph. 3:8.



     What do you think made the greatest impression upon the Thes-
88
       Paul's Godly Example                                 September 21
      salonians? Paul's knowledge of Scripture, his preaching abilities, his
      personal conversion experience, or his lifestyle and manner? Why?

         While formal preaching and teaching are still God's appointed means of
      winning souls, nothing witnesses so powerfully as the Christ-like life. The
      real power among the Thessalonians was their conviction of the Jesus who
      had come and the Jesus who was about to return. This was the basis for
      their lives and message. A church of believers whose lives exemplify the
      message they espouse will in the end make a stronger impression upon
      others than the clearest accumulation of facts and figures or the most ar-
      ticulate exposition of prophecy.

      PRACTICAL RESPONSE:
        • Name two personal blessings you have received this week for which
          you are grateful.
        • Name two blessings recently enjoyed by your church (congregation)
          for which you are particularly grateful.
        • Name two special blessings enjoyed recently by your family, or per-
          sons with whom you are closely associated, for which you are par-
          ticularly grateful.
        • What is the most effective way of expressing thanksgiving to God
          for His goodness to you and those you love?

FRI   FURTHER MEDITATION AND STUDY:
         What Jesus says about people who follow practical Christianity: Matt.
      5:1-12.
         What Paul says elsewhere: 2 Cor. 3:1-6; Phil. 2:1-11; 3:17-21.
         What Ellen G. White says: "It is a terrible thing to lose our own soul,
      but to pursue a course that will cause the loss of other souls is still more
      terrible."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 158.
         "Hard and dark as the world is, the influence of a really consistent ex-
      ample will be a power for good."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 286.
         "Every day of life is freighted with responsibilities which we must
      bear. Every day, our words and acts are making impressions upon those
      with whom we associate."—Prophets and Kings, p. 348.
         "A godly example will tell more for the truth than the greatest
      eloquence, unaccompanied by a well-ordered life."—Gospel Workers,
      p. 104.

      SUMMARY: The demonstration of the gospel's power in our lives is the
      most effective weapon in heaven's arsenal. We may not be the thoroughly
      finished product that heaven desires, but even in our developing condition,
      we are lights in a darkened world—happy testimonies of the regenerating
      power of the Word of God.

           The Sanctified Life
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Thessalonians 4:1-7; 2 Thessalonians 2:13-
17.
SAB     MEMORY TEXT: "And the very God of peace sanctify you
PM
        wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be
        preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ"
        (1 Thessalonians 5:23).

HOLINESS IS OUR GOAL. Sanctification is the highest and most
complete form of Christian living possible. Jesus Christ, the Man of
Galilee, is our example in this regard, but He has provided us more than
just the example. He also provides us the understanding and the re-creative
force that make sanctification (holiness) possible.
LESSON OUTLINE:
   I. Exhortations to Godly Living (1 Thess. 4:3, 4, 7).
   H. The Agent of Sanctification (2 Thess. 2:13).
 I11. Bodily Sanctification (1 Thess. 4:3-7).
  IV. Complete Sanctification (1 Thess. 5:23).
   V. Christ Our Sanctification (1 Thess. 5:24).
THE EMPHASIS ON SANCTIFICATION IN PAUL'S WRITINGS.
Paul wished for the elders of Ephesus an inheritance among "them which
are [Greek: 'have been'] sanctified" (Acts 20:32). He used the term in
connection with his labors among the Gentiles in Rome who were made
acceptable by sanctification. (See Rom. 15:16.) He addressed the believers
at Corinth as "them that are [Greek: 'have been'] sanctified in Christ
Jesus, called to be saints" (1 Cor. 1:2). He also wrote to the Corinthians:
"But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the
name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God" (1 Cor. 6:11,
RSV). He reminded the Ephesians that "Christ also loved the church, and
gave himself for it; that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
of water by the word" (Eph. 5:25, 26). He challenged Timothy to flee
youthful lusts and be a "vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the
master's use" (2 Tim. 2:21). To the Hebrews he wrote that "both the one

who makes men holy and those who are made holy are of the same
family" (Heb. 2:11, NIV).
    Paul's fundamental concern for the Thessalonians was not merely
that they escape from one specific sin or another, but rather that they attain
that state which he called "holiness." He expresses this concern for the
believers in Thessalonica through a number of illuminating phrases. They
were to "walk worthy of God" (1 Thess. 2:12; 2 Thess. 1:11), to be "un-
blamable" (1 Thess. 3:13; 5:23), and to be holy (1 Thess. 4:7).
    In writing to the Thessalonians in this manner, Paul points believers of
all eras to the fundamental concern of Christian endeavor. In upholding
sanctification (holiness) to the church at Thessalonica, Paul makes this ob-
jective not only necessary but attractive, and entirely possible.

I. EXHORTATIONS TO GODLY LIVING (1 Thess. 4:3, 4, 7).

1. What words may be used to describe the Christian's ideal life-
   style?

   1 Thess. 3:13

   1 Thess. 4:3, 4

   1 Thess. 4:7

   2 Thess. 2:13

  The Greek word translated "sanctification" may also be translated
"holiness." For example, 1 Thessalonians 4:7 may be translated, "For
God has not called us to impurity, but to sanctification [KJV: 'holiness]."
Throughout the New Testament holiness and sanctification are synony-
mous terms.

2. What is meant by "unblamable in holiness" (1 Thess. 3:13)? Com-
   pare 1 Thess. 5:23.



   The judgment is God's. " `Unblamable in holiness' represents the
highest possible ethical and spiritual standard. The apostle believes that
such a standard can be reached by the grace that Christ supplies to those of
His followers who increase in love. To believe less would be to deny the
gospel. . . .
   "Paul's concern is that his converts should be adjudged blameless, not
by men, who are fallible, but by God, who searches the hearts and knows
what is in the mind."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 241.

3. What two important aspects are involved in sanctification? Com-
   pare 1 Cor. 6:11 with 1 Thess. 3:12-4:3.



                                                                            91
       Lesson 13                                              September 28
         "True sanctification is harmony with God, oneness with Him in
      character."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 350.
         "Sanctification is a state of holiness, without and within, being holy
      and without reserve the Lord's, not in form, but in truth."—Our High
      Calling, p. 214.
         ["Sanctification] is a continual growth in grace."—Testimonies, vol. 1,
      p. 340.
         "Sanctification means habitual communion with God."—Ellen G.
      White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 908.
         "Sanctification is a progressive work; it is not attained to in an hour or
      a day, and then maintained without any special effort on our part."—Tes-
      timonies, vol. 2, p. 472.
         "Sanctification consists in the cheerful performance of daily duties in
      perfect obedience to the will of God."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 360.

         Sanctification is both present holiness in Christ and growth in holi-
      ness in Christ. When Christ comes into the heart of the believer, he or she
      receives the gift of the holiness of Christ. But the believer remains a fallen
      human being with tendencies toward evil. (See 1 Cor. 9:27.) Sanctification
      also involves growth in holiness. This growth is effected by the daily re-
      ception of Christ's power, which alone can overcome the biases of fallen
      humanity.

MON   H. THE AGENT OF SANCTIFICATION (2 Thess. 2:13).

      4. Who is the active agent in the sanctification process? 2 Thess.
         2:13; Rom. 15:16; 1 Peter 1:1, 2.



          Never does the Bible speak of human beings making themselves holy.
         "It is through the Spirit that Christ dwells in us; and the Spirit of God,
      received into the heart by faith, is the beginning of the life eternal.--The
      Desire of Ages, p. 388.
          "The followers of Christ are to become like Him—by the grace of God
      to form characters in harmony with the principles of His holy law. This is
      Bible sanctification. This work can be accomplished only through faith in
      Christ, by the power of the indwelling Spirit of God."—The Great Con-

6. What tangible evidence is seen in the life of those for whom
   sanctification is a reality? Acts 5:32; 1 Peter 1:2.



    "It is not enough for us to believe that Jesus is not an impostor, and that
the religion of the Bible is no cunningly devised fable. We may believe
that the name of Jesus is the only name under heaven whereby man may be
saved, and yet we may not through faith make Him our personal Saviour.
It is not enough to believe the theory of truth. It is not enough to make a
profession of faith in Christ and have our names registered on the church
roll. 'He that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him.
And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath
given us.' Hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his com-
mandments.' 1 John 3:24; 2:3. This is the genuine evidence of conversion.
Whatever our profession, it amounts to nothing unless Christ is revealed in
works of righteousness."—Christ' s Object Lessons, pp. 312, 313.

I11. BODILY SANCTIFICATION (1 Thess. 4:3-7).

7. What aspect of the Thessalonian believers' sanctification especially
   concerned the apostle? 1 Thess. 4:3-7.



   Paul warned both the Thessalonians and the Corinthians about the
danger of sexual immorality. (See 1 Corinthians 7.) There were sufficient
problems in Thessalonica to warrant his caution and correction. In 1 Thes-
salonians chapter four, Paul devotes no less than five of the 18 verses to
pointed injunctions against moral impurity.
   The Greek word translated "fornication" (1 Thess. 4:3) refers to sexual
immorality whether committed• by married or unmarried persons. (See
Matt. 5:32; 19:9.)

   A tragedy repeated. "As we approach the close of time, as the people
of God stand upon the borders of the heavenly Canaan, Satan will, as of
old, redouble his efforts to prevent them from entering the goodly land. He
lays his snares for every soul. It is not the ignorant and uncultured merely
that need to be guarded; he will prepare his temptations for those in the
highest positions, in the most holy office; if he can lead them to pollute
their souls, he can through them destroy many. And he employs the same
agents now as he employed three thousand years ago. By worldly friend-
ships, by the charms of beauty, by pleasure seeking, mirth, feasting, or the
wine cup, he tempts to the violation of the seventh commandment."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 457, 458.

  In what ways may sexual immorality be understood as defrauding
another, or others, or even one's self?



                                                                             93

      IV. COMPLETE SANCTIFICATION (1 Thess. 5:23).
      8. What is to be the extent of the sanctification that Paul wishes for
         the believers? 1 Thess. 5:23.


         The spirit and soul. "By 'spirit'. . . may be understood the higher prin-
      ciple of intelligence and thought with which man is endowed, and with
      which God can communicate by His Spirit. . . . It is by the renewing of the
      mind through the action of the Holy Spirit that the individual is trans-
      formed into Christ's likeness. . . .
         "By 'soul'. . . when distinguished from spirit, may be understood that
      part of a man's nature that finds expression through the instincts, emotions,
      and desires. This part of one's nature can be sanctified, too. When, through
      the working of the Holy Spirit, the mind is brought into conformity with
      God's mind, and sanctified reason bears sway over the lower nature, the
      impulses, which would otherwise be contrary to God, become subject to
      His will. Thus the humble Christian may reach such a height of sanctifica-
      tion that when obeying God he is really carrying out his own impulses. He
      delights to do God's will."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 257.
WED    9. Why is sanctification (holiness) so important? Hebrews 12:14.



         The message of Hebrews 12:14 summarizes Paul's wish for the believ-
      ers—peace and holiness—peace, denoting the believers' relationships with
      their fellow humans, and holiness, signifying their relationships with God.
      Without the latter, there cannot be the former, and without both, one can-
      not see God.

      V. CHRIST OUR SANCTIFICATION (1 Thess. 5:24).
      10. By whose authority does the Holy Spirit accomplish our
          sanctification? 1 Thess. 5:24.


      11. Why is sanctification necessarily a lifelong process? Gal. 5:16-18.



         The struggle continues. "So long as Satan reigns, we shall have self to
      subdue, besetting sins to overcome; so long as life shall last, there will be
      no stopping place, no point which we can reach and say, I have fully at-
      tained. Sanctification is the result of lifelong obedience."—The Acts of the
      Apostles, pp. 560, 561.

      12. How does Paul emphasize the means of victory over sin
          throughout the lifelong process of sanctification? Romans 6:9-14.
      94
  The Sanctified Life                                  September 28
    We live in Christ. The word reckon used in the King James of Romans
6:11 is variously translated as "consider" (RSV, Moffatt, Amplified), "re-
gard" (Weymouth, NEB). The Good News Bible (TEV) reads "think of
yourselves as dead, so far as sin is concerned." The Greek word translated
"reckon" often means to "count something to be true because it is true."
    The "old man" of sin, which Paul defines as the old sinful manner of
life, no longer controls the person who has accepted Christ as Saviour and
Lord. (See Rom. 6:6; Eph. 4:22-24; Col. 3:1-10.) Even so, the born-again
believer remains a fallen human being with biases to evil that must be con-
tinually combatted through the power bestowed by Christ. (See Gal. 5:16-
19; 1 Cor. 9:27.)

   Christ now reigns within. (See Col. 1:27). He occupies the throne; our
fallen humanity is reduced to helplessness by the indwelling power of
Jesus. As long as we allow Him to reign, we are no longer discouraged,
dismayed, or overcome. Our flesh is unholy (see Selected Messages, book
2, p. 32), and we will not be rid of this mortal burden until Jesus comes.
But we proceed as if it were so even now—overcoming and ignoring the
suggestions of the flesh—because the "new man," Christ Himself, is
living in our hearts by the Holy Spirit. (See Rom. 8:1-11.)

13. Because the process by which we grow spiritually never is fully
    completed in this life, what absolutely essential role does Jesus
    perform for our salvation? 1 Cor. 1:30, 31; Jer. 23:6 (compare
    1 John 5:4, 5).



   Christ our righteousness. "And while we cannot claim perfection of
the flesh, we may have Christian perfection of the soul. Through the sacri-
fice made in our behalf, sins may be perfectly forgiven. Our dependence is
not in what man can do; it is in what God can do for man through Christ.
When we surrender ourselves wholly to God, and fully believe, the blood
of Christ cleanses from all sin. The conscience can be freed from condem-
nation. Through faith in His blood, all may be made perfect in Christ Jesus.
Thank God that we are not dealing with impossibilities. We may claim
sanctification. We may enjoy the favor of God. We are not to be anxious
about what Christ and God think of us, but about what God thinks of
Christ, our Substitute. Ye are accepted in the Beloved. The Lord shows, to
the repenting, believing one, that Christ accepts the surrender of the soul,
to be molded and fashioned after His own likeness."—Selected Messages,
book 2, pp. 32, 33. (See also Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 471,472.)

  Why is it necessary to rely upon Christ's sanctification if in fact we
ourselves are being daily renewed or sanctified, that is, growing in
grace?

ASK YOURSELF:
  • What are the clearest evidences in my behavior that the process of
    sanctification is being successfully conducted?
  • What are the evidences in my thoughts and behavior that the process
                                                                         95
        Lesson 13                                               September 28
             of sanctification is not yet complete in my life?
           • What historical event more than any other convinces me of Christ's
             willingness to substitute His complete or absolute holiness for my
             developing or incomplete righteousness?

FRI   FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION:
         What Jesus says about sanctification: John 17:9-19.
         What Paul says elsewhere: 1 Cor. 7:2-5; 2 Cor. 7:1; Heb. 10:10-29.
         What Ellen White says: "It is impossible for any to enjoy the blessing
      of sanctification while they are selfish and gluttonous."—The Sanctified
      Life, p. 25.
         "The only way in which He [Jesus] could set and keep men right was
      to make Himself visible and familiar to their eyes."—Signs of the Times,
      Jan. 20, 1890.
         "There will be no place for outward adornment in the sanctified heart;
      but there will be an earnest, anxious seeking for the inward adorning, the
      Christian graces—the fruits of the Spirit of God. . . . If the heart is re-
      formed, it will be seen in the outward appearance."—Testimonies, vol. 1,
      p. 162.
         "[Sanctification] is not gained by a happy flight of feeling, but is the re-
      sult of constantly dying to sin, and constantly living for Christ. Wrongs
      cannot be righted nor reformations wrought in the character by feeble,
      intermittent efforts. It is only by long, persevering effort, sore discipline,
      and stern conflict, that we shall overcome."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp.
      560, 561.
         "Bible sanctification does not consist in strong emotion. Here is where
      many are led into error. They make feelings their criterion. When they feel
      elated or happy, they claim that they are sanctified. Happy feelings or the
      absence of joy is no evidence that a person is or is not sanctified."—The
      Sanctified Life, p. 10.
         "The sanctification set forth in the Sacred Scriptures has to do with the
      entire being—spirit, soul, and body. Here is the true idea of entire con-
      secration. Paul prays that the church at Thessalonica may enjoy this great
      blessing. 'The very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your
      whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of
      our Lord Jesus Christ' (1 Thess. 5:23)."—The Sanctified Life, p. 7.
         Also read The Great Controversy, pp. 469-478.

      SUMMARY: Quickened by the Spirit, convicted by the cross, cleansed by
      the Word, redeemed by the blood, covered by the robe, by God's grace all
      of us can enjoy the happy, holy life of those for whom sanctification is a
      daily reality. This can be achieved through a trusting relationship with our
      friendly, trustworthy God.
