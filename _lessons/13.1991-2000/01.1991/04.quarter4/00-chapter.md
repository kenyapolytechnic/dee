       Introduction to the Book of Proverbs
          Proverbs to Live By
     The book of Proverbs was written primarily by Solomon, son of David, in the
early part of his reign as king of Israel. "In the proverbs of Solomon are outlined
principles of holy living and high endeavor, principles that are heaven-born and
that lead to godliness, principles that should govern every act of life. It was the
wide dissemination of these principles, and the recognition of God as the One to
whom all praise and honor belong, that made Solomon's early reign a time of
moral uplift as well as of material prosperity."—Prophets and Kings, pp. 33, 34.
     The last two chapters of the book are attributed respectively to "Agur" and
"Lemuel." Some scholars have assumed that these two names refer to Solomon.
Others have concluded that they were unknown compilers or authors.
     We know from 1 Kings 4:32 that Solomon "uttered three thousand proverbs;
and his songs were a thousand and five" (RSV). His fame spread abroad; the
wisdom with which he was endowed was the wonder of the whole world. "And the
whole earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had
put into his mind" (1 Kings 10:24, RSV).
     A proverb is "a short, pithy saying in common use."—alford English Diction-
ary. A proverb "sums up in compact and easily remembered form an observation
or judgment which is widely held to be true."—R. B. Y. Scott, Proverbs:
Ecclesiastes, The Anchor Bible (Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1985), p. 3.
The biblical proverbs were written in Hebrew poetic form.
     The purpose of these lessons on Proverbs is to demonstrate that only as we have
a living fellowship with God can we maintain purity of heart and conduct. Know-
ing God through Christ as Saviour and King affects every area of our lives. True
religion is the power for moral and ethical purity. Proverbs is a book of practical
religion designed to demonstrate the results of faith in action. It is a tool for the
purpose of enabling believers to act wisely, to think about what they do and why
they do it, and to be more sensible and sensitive citizens as a result of integrating
 learning and faith.
     We are studying the book of Proverbs topically rather than verse by verse
 because the issues and themes raised in the book are not in any apparent order, and
 some of them recur a number of times.
     The major purpose of education is the redemption of the individual: to impart
 God's character to those who are willing, so that their thoughts, words, and deeds
 are truly representative of Him. The proverbs and these lessons were designed: (1)
 to provide a view of our need; (2) to lead us to the Source of wisdom, power, and
 salvation; and (3) to furnish a practical guide for every major area of life. Hence the
 title—Proverbs to Live By.

      What Are Your Priorities?

SAB       LEARNING IS INTENDED TO MAKE US WISE. But what is wis-
 PM   dom? Education is often thought to be an absolute must for success in
      today's world. But we often become so absorbed in striving for temporal
      success that we lose sight of the purpose and the magnitude of true educa-
      tion. Sometimes we fail to reach the most important goals. Education be-
      comes a frantic struggle for academic success with financial security as the
      ultimate goal.
         "Our ideas of education take too narrow and too low a range. There
      is need of a broader scope, a higher aim. True education means more than
      the pursual of a certain course of study. It means more than a preparation
      for the life that now is. It has to do with the whole being, and with the
      whole period of existence possible to man."—Education, p. 13.
          William Cowper aptly stated, "Knowledge and wisdom, far from being
      one, have ofttimes no connection." Unless our learning acquaints us with
      the Source of all wisdom and righteousness, unless through His power we
      are being restored to His image, unless our sights are fixed on the far
      reaches of eternity and everything in this life is valued accordingly, all
      acquired knowledge, learning, and skill fall short of being true education,
      for they do not make us truly wise.

      and the knowledge of the holy is understanding" (Proverbs 9:10).

I. WHAT IS WISDOM? (Prov. 1:1-7; 2:10, 11).

   The value of receiving God's wisdom forms the theme of the book of
Proverbs. Solomon emphasizes that wisdom is to direct every area of our
lives. Wisdom unites piety and the common duties of life. Wisdom is to
think and act as God would in any situation of life.

1. What is a proverb? What does Solomon state as the purpose of his
   proverbs? Prov. 1:1-6.



   Proverb defined. The Hebrew word translated proverb means "a simil-
itude," "a parable." It usually comprises a brief statement of practical
wisdom. The corresponding verb means "to be like," "to compare," "to
represent." In a proverb, briefly expressed truth is illustrated by compari-
son or contrast. For example: "The tongue of the just is as choice silver:
the heart of the wicked is little worth" (Prov. 10:20).
   Most of the proverbs are in couplets or triplets, in which lines corre-
sponding in structure and length are arranged for purposes of comparison
and contrast. Sometimes proverbs illustrate truth through a short discourse
or parable.

   Solomon's target audience. The simple, the young, and the wise are
the target audience Solomon had in mind. Because the simple are inher-
ently susceptible to enticement and deception, they can benefit from the
prudence taught in the proverbs. The young, lacking years and experience,
can profit from the wisdom of one who has traveled the path before them.
They can gain knowledge and discretion from that individual's instruction.

2. What is wisdom? How is it related to knowledge? Prov. 1:7; 2:9,
   10 (compare 15:21; 24:3-6).



   Note: In these lessons the Bible references in parentheses provide
additional material for those who wish to enrich their study. The ref-
erences immediately following the questions are intended to provide
the answers.

   Many shades of meaning. Young's Analytical Concordance to the
Bible lists 13 different words from the original languages, which have
been translated "wisdom." In the Old Testament, those having wisdom
are not necessarily the "wise" of the book of Proverbs. They may be:
(1) those who practice magic arts (Ex. 7:11; Isa. 47:9, 10); (2) those
with special skills (Ex. 36:8; 2 Chron. 2:12); (3) those who are clever,
sly, or cunning (2 Sam. 14:2); (4) those who have the practical wisdom
to handle the perils of life (Prov. 6:6; 14:24); (5) cultured, educated
people (1 Kings 4:29); (6) those who accept commandments and instruc-
tion (Prov. 3:1; 8:33).

                                                                           7
          Lesson 1                                                  October 5
         In the book of Proverbs, the wisdom extolled is holiness of life
      resulting from a personal fellowship with God. There is no true wisdom
      apart from "the fear of the Lord" (Prov. 1:7; 9:10). This is not referring to
      fear in the sense of being afraid. We fear God when we reverence and
      respect Him. (See Ex. 20:20.) The ability to act wisely in every situation of
      life stems from a heart union with God by which the humble believer
      becomes a sharer of His holy character.

      3. To whom is wisdom available? Prov. 1:20-23; 8:1-5 (compare 9:1,
         4; James 1:5).



         The measure of the Spirit given is determined by our capacity to re-
      ceive. This capacity is created by our willingness to lay aside selfishness,
      preconceived opinions, and private methods of coming to conclusions.
      Then we can accept the wisdom that comes from above.

MON   4. Who is the source of true wisdom? Prov. 2:6; 9:10 (compare 3:19,
         20; 8:22-31).



          God is the fountain of all blessing. Whether physical, intellectual, or
      emotional development is desired, God gives strength and understanding
      that we might attain the highest good. "Our Father in heaven is the source
      of life, of wisdom, and of joy$'—Steps to Christ, p. 9.
          It is sad to note that much of what the world around us esteems as
      wisdom in reality is worthless. "Worldly wisdom is foolishness with God.
      Those who rely upon it will surely err."—The Desire of Ages, p. 354.
          In every age people have sacrificed to attain knowledge that was re-
      garded as acceptable in their social situation. In some eras of history philo-
      sophical knowledge was given supreme value. In our age, scientific knowl-
      edge is regarded by many as of greater value than either philosophical or
      religious knowledge. The kind of knowledge that God invites us to receive
      is an experience in holiness. To know by experience Christ's saving grace
      opens for us the gates of the eternal city of God.

         What is of greater value to you, an education that the world re-
      spects or a personal union with Christ? If you are a parent, what are
      you more interested in your children having? Suppose they are con-
      fronted with a choice between achieving recognition in the world and
      obeying the commandments of God; how would you advise them?

      11. THE VALUE OF WISDOM (Prov. 4:5-7).

      5. How did Solomon describe the value of wisdom? Prov. 4:5-7; 3:14,
         15.



      8
What Are Your Priorities?                                     October 5
   Nothing can compare in value with the life that is "hid with Christ in
God" (Col. 3:3). When the old life of sin has been put away, and Christ
has been given control of mind, body, emotions, motives, and plans, the
ethical and moral practices of the believer will be wise. (See Col. 3:5-10.)

6. What are some of the advantages enjoyed by those who obtain
   true wisdom? Prov. 2:10-22; 4:6-13 (compare 8:14-16, 18; 9:10,
   11).



  Are you seeking the kind of wisdom that comes from God, or that
which the world respects? How would you define the difference be-
tween these two kinds of wisdom?

I11. HOW IS WISDOM ATTAINED? (Prov. 2:1-6; James 1:5).

7. In what manner should we seek for wisdom in order to find it?
   Prov. 2:1-6; James 1:5 (compare Prov. 8:34; Jer. 29:13).



   Jesus' parable of the treasure hid in a field provides a classic illustration
of the value of the heavenly treasure and the effort necessary to obtain it.
(See Matt 13:44.) Spiritual wisdom is part of this treasure and while it is a
gift of God, it is bestowed only on those who earnestly seek it.

8. How do we "buy" wisdom and truth (Prov. 23:23)? Prov. 9:6
   (compare Rev. 3:17-19; Isa. 55:1).



   "Jesus is going from door to door, standing in front of every soul
temple, proclaiming, 'I stand at the door, and knock.' As a heavenly
merchantman, He opens His treasures and cries, 'Buy of me gold tried in
the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be
clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear.' The gold that
He offers is without alloy, more precious than that of Ophir; for it is faith
and love. The white raiment He invites the soul to wear is His own robe of
righteousness; and the oil for anointing is the oil of His grace, which will
give spiritual eyesight to the soul in blindness and darkness, that he may
distinguish between the workings of the Spirit of God and the spirit of the
enemy. 'Open your doors,' says the great Merchantman, the possessor of
spiritual riches, 'and transact your business with Me. It is I, your Re-
deemer, who counsels you to buy of Me.' "—Ellen G. White Comments,
SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, pp. 965, 966.

   Time is money and life. Every day each of us spends time in trade
for one kind of treasure or another. With whom are we doing our
business? Of what character are our transactions? Have our priorities
become confused as to what constitutes true wealth? What do we put
                                                                               9
       Lesson 1                                                   October 5
      first each day? What influences do we allow to govern our decisions?
      What goals direct our conduct?

WED   IV. WHAT IS RIGHTEOUSNESS? (Prov. 2:7-10; 21:3).

      9. Who are "the righteous"? Prov. 29:6, 7 (compare 11:30, 31; 12:3,
         7, 26, 28).



         Consistently with the Old Testament in general, the book of Proverbs
      speaks of the righteous as those who live righteous lives, those who per-
      form righteous deeds, because of their heart union with God. The behavior
      of the righteous, including their thoughts, is righteous. A righteous person
      does not commit iniquity. (See Eze. 18:5-9.)

      10. How do we become righteous? Prov. 2:7-10 (compare Isa. 32:15-
          17).



         Righteousness is not an intangible quality that God pours upon us.
      The Bible never separates the believer's righteousness from Christ's
      dwelling in the heart. The covenant relationship with God, by which His
      Spirit reigns within, is the only source of righteousness. (See Rom. 8:9,
      10; 10:6-10.) The power to think righteous thoughts and do righteous
      deeds is available only to the person who has friendship and fellowship
      with Christ.

          Our only ground of hope. "So we have nothing in ourselves of which
      to boast. We have no ground for self-exaltation. Our only ground of hope
      is in the righteousness of Christ imputed to us, and in that wrought by His
      Spirit working in and through us."—Steps to Christ, p. 63.

      11. What two kinds of activity are compared in Proverbs 21:3, and
          how does God relate to each? Compare Isa. 1:10-18.



          "Who asked you to trample My courts? What is all this multitude of
      ceremonies for? And all these sacrifices—do you think I delight in the
      slaughter of animals? Come now, and let's reason together." Can't you
      almost hear the Lord's exasperation mingled with heartbreak for His way-
      ward people?
          "Come," He pleads, "let Me give you a solution to your situation. I
      can change your sinful heart. Sacrifices were intended to remind you of the
      Messiah to come, but only I can take away your sin. Even though your life
      is like crimson, I can make it as white as snow." (See Isa. 1:10-18; com-
      pare Amos 5:21-24.)
          Unless the carnal mind is crucified, there is no salvation. (See Rom.
      8:6.) Any kind of sacrifice with an unsurrendered heart is only a form of
      10
 What Are Your Priorities?                                 October 5
godliness without the power. God rejects all rituals and human perform-
ances in the absences of His righteousness. This alone renders the heart
right and just.

12. What can we learn from the book of Hebrews about what God
    really wants? Heb. 10:4; 11:6.



   Jesus became human that He might reveal beyond all question what
God is like and what He really wants of His people. Sacrifices? Offerings?
Certainly not as they were misused by His Old Testament chosen people,
and not at all now that the sacrifice toward which they pointed has been
offered. The Lord declared, "Lo, I come . . . to do thy will, 0 God" (Heb.
10:7; see also Ps. 40:8). It was not merely to prove it could be done that
Jesus lived a life of harmony and obedience. His life revealed what was in
His heart. He offers this same experience to all who will receive it. (See
Eze. 36:26; Heb. 8:10.)

  As you examine your heart critically, on whose righteousness do
you tend to depend: Christ's or your own? Do you feel accepted by
God because of good things you do, or because of what Christ has
done and is doing for you?

V. RIGHTEOUSNESS AND WISDOM (Prov. 2:1-6, 9).

13. What is the relationship between righteousness and wisdom?
    Prov. 2:1-6, 9; 23:23, 24.



    Wisdom and righteousness are not completely synonymous terms. The
wisdom spoken of in the Old Testament cannot always be identified with
righteousness. But the kind of wisdom that the book of Proverbs discusses
is the righteousness that results from a covenant relationship with God.
When the Lord has control of a mind through the power of His Spirit, that
mind is a wise, righteous mind. In Proverbs 23:24 the "father of the
righteous" is "he that begetteth a wise child."
    The wisdom of the righteous person is manifested in a multitude of
ways, many of which are spelled out in the book of Proverbs. The author
is not saying that we become righteous in God's eyes when we act in a
wise manner. Rather the message is that when we come to know the Lord,
as it is our privilege to know Him, our thoughts, words, and deeds are wise
because Christ has become our righteousness and wisdom. (See 1 Cor.
1:30.)

PERSONAL QUESTIONS TO ANSWER:
  • Is the emphasis in my education on knowledge of facts, or on wis-
dom?
  • How can I come to recognize God as the Source of all true wisdom?

        • What am I buying with my time? Am I putting "first things first"?
        • Am I being wise in my job and relationships?
        • What is my attitude toward the sacrifice of Christ for me? Do I view
     His work for me merely as a quick and easy way to take care of unpleasant
     happenings day by day, or does it provide hope and help for present and
     future victory?

     FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Study the following New
ua   Testament passages on the subject of wisdom: 1 Cor. 1:25-30; 2:6-16;
     3:19.
         "A knowledge of God is the foundation of all true education and of all
     true service. . . . This knowledge is the essential preparation both for this
     life and for the life to come."—Ministry of Healing, p. 409.
         "The fear of the Lord lies at the very foundation of all progress; it is the
     beginning of wisdom. Your Heavenly Father has claims upon you; for
     without solicitation or merit on your part He gives you the bounties of His
     providence. . . . As you are bought with a price, even the precious blood of
     the Son of God, He requires that you make a right use of the privileges you
     enjoy. Your intellectual and moral faculties are God's gifts, talents en-
     trusted to you for wise improvement, and you are not at liberty to let them
     lie dormant for want of proper cultivation, or be crippled and dwarfed by
     inaction. It is for you to determine whether or not the weighty responsibili-
     ties that rest upon you shall be faithfully met, whether or not your efforts
     shall be well directed and your best."—Fundamentals of Christian Educa-
     tion, pp. 85, 86.

     SUMMARY: The fear of the Lord—a relationship of reverence, admira-
     tion, and trust—puts the seeker for true wisdom in touch with its Source.
     Righteousness makes sense. It is more than a legal standing in the books of
     heaven. Righteousness enables the believer to live out the character of
     God. It empowers us to view life from the perspective of eternity and make
     decisions accordingly. The wisdom that comes from God ensures right use
     of knowledge and places its possessor in line for ultimate, eternal success.

SAB      WHAT IS TRUST, AND WHY IS IT IMPORTANT? Faith, the hand
PM
      that lays hold upon the resources of Omnipotence, consists of more than just
      belief; trust is a vital component. But what is trust? How does it work?
         Does trust belong in a compartment separate from daily life, preserved
      only for religion? Is it practical? Can it benefit anybody?
         These are not rhetorical questions. They deserve answers. We need
      these answers in order to survive.
         Trust includes willingness to commit oneself to the care of the one
      trusted. It is one thing to agree that a tightrope walker is capable of
      wheeling a person in a wheelbarrow on a rope strung over a thundering
      waterfall. It is quite another to volunteer to ride in the wheelbarrow.
         A dictionary defines trust as complete assurance regarding the char-
      acter, ability, strength, or truth of someone or something. Trust involves
      placing confidence in someone, depending on him, committing oneself to
      his care, relying totally on his integrity.
         Jesus is the One to be fully trusted. He is like a gleaming star on a clear
      night to whom each believing traveler may look for guidance and comfort.

      MEMORY TEXT: "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean
      not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him,
      and he shall direct thy paths" (Proverbs 3:5, 6).

      THEME: The subject of trust—what it is, what it is for, and whom it is
      for—is the focus of this lesson.

   It is impossible for us to make of ourselves faithful, trusting people.
Trust in God is His gift to us that develops as we admit our weakness and
submit to His enabling might. But God does not make us trust when we
wish to doubt. True trust is based on intimate knowledge of the one trusted.
Because we learn of and accept God's love and ability to sustain us, we
trust Him. Willingness to trust God enables us to trust human beings whom
we have discovered to be trustworthy.

    Faith is given by the Holy Spirit. "While God has given ample evi-
dence for faith, He will never remove all excuse for unbelief. All who look
for hooks to hang their doubts upon will find them. And those who refuse
to accept and obey God's word until every objection has been removed,
and there is no longer an opportunity for doubt, will never come to the
light.
    "Distrust of God is the natural outgrowth of the unrenewed heart,
which is at enmity with Him. But faith is inspired by the Holy Spirit, and
it will flourish only as it is cherished. No man can become strong in faith
without a determined effort. Unbelief strengthens as it is encouraged; and
if men, instead of dwelling upon the evidences which God has given to
sustain their faith, permit themselves to question and cavil, they will find
their doubts constantly becoming more confirmed."—The Great Con-
troversy, p. 527. (Italics supplied.)

2. How does trust grow and become strong? What can you learn
   from the following passages?

     Prov. 29:25

     Prov. 30:5

     Matt. 8:5-10

     Matt. 9:2

     James 1:2-8

   Faith increases as it is exercised. "You have to talk faith, you have to
live faith, you have to act faith, that you may have an increase of faith; and
thus exercising that living faith you will grow to strong men and women in
Christ Jesus."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol.
5, pp. 1121, 1122.

   Friends of yours have just lost their baby son and their home
in a hurricane. What could you say or do to help them trust in
God?

11. IS OUR TRUST MISPLACED? (Prov. 28:26).

   Faith is no problem to some people—they have faith in just about
anything! But trust is worthless if not anchored in what is trustworthy.

      3. What warning does Solomon sound in Proverbs 28:26?



         Self-confidence in questions involving eternal salvation and the ability
      to overcome sin can be a sure passport to failure and ruin. (See John 15:5;
      Jer. 10:23; 2 Cor. 3:5.)

      4. Who else besides ourselves is it unsafe to trust? Prov. 2:11-17;
         13:20 (compare Jer. 17:5; Ps. 41:9).



         We are invited in Scripture: "Have sincere love for your brothers, love
      one another deeply, from the heart" (1 Peter 1:22, NIV). Obviously such
      love involves a measure of trust. We trust those who trust the Lord—at
      least in regard to some things. We also trust unbelieving friends in regard
      to some things. But it would be a mistake to trust a brother or sister to keep
      us from falling into sin. They might help, but the ultimate deliverance
      comes only from Christ. Other human beings should never become the
      ultimate focus of our trust.

MON       The need is for a personal experience with God. "If we mistake the
      wisdom of man for the wisdom of God we are led astray by the foolishness
      of man's wisdom. Here is the great danger of many. . . . They have not an
      experience for themselves. They have not been in the habit of prayerfully
      considering for themselves, with unprejudiced, unbiased judgment, ques-
      tions and subjects that are new and that are ever liable to arise. They wait
      to see what others will think. . . . Unless these become sensible of their
      wavering character and correct it, they will all fail of everlasting life; they
      will be unable to cope with the perils of the last days. . . . Neither young
      nor old are excusable in trusting to another to have an experience for them.
      . . . A noble self-reliance is needed in the Christian experience and war-
       fare."—Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 129, 130.

      5. What is one thing that cannot be trusted to provide security?
         Prov. 11:4, 28; 23:4, 5 (compare Jer. 5:17; Ps. 20:7).



         In this materialistic age the tendency is to rely upon things for security.
      The inspired counsel is that the Lord is our only security. He expects us to
      do what we can to provide for ourselves and our families, but ultimately
      our dependence must be totally upon Him. When it is no longer possible
      for believers to buy or sell (Rev. 13:17), they will know from past ex-
      perience the value of trust in God.

        How can you know with certainty that you are trusting in God and
      not in your prosperity?

      6. List some other things that are unworthy of our trust:
                                                                                  15

     Prov. 31:30

     Prov. 10:18

7. What special blessings are given to those who trust in the Lord?
   Prov. 8:17, 18 (compare Eze. 33:13).



    We are invited to trust in the Lord for the bestowal of His righteousness.
Goodness, love, mercy, and wise counsel flow from the life of the one who
constantly relies upon the Lord. Self-dependence, self-assurance in spir-
itual life is a snare that Satan has prepared to destroy God's people. Satan's
studied purpose is to lead us to trust our own efforts and to respect our own
goodness. If he were to succeed in this, we would become his victims; the
life of victory would escape us.

   How would you help a person who trusts in self rather than in God?
Would you frankly point out the problem, or would you try in some
indirect way to lead such a person to dependence upon Christ?

I11. A STAR TO GUIDE THE HUMBLE (Prov. 3:5, 6).

8. Why does God want us to trust Him? Prov. 3:5, 6; Matt. 6:25-34.



    "If you have given yourself to God, to do His work, you have no need
to be anxious for tomorrow. . . . When we take into our hands the manage-
ment of things with which we have to do, and depend upon our own
wisdom for success, we are taking a burden which God has not given us,
and are trying to bear it without His aid. We are taking upon ourselves the
responsibility that belongs to God, and thus are really putting ourselves in
His place. We may well have anxiety and anticipate danger and loss, for it
is certain to befall us. But when we really believe that God loves us and
means to do us good we shall cease to worry about the future. We shall
trust God as a child trusts a loving parent. Then our troubles and torments
will disappear, for our will is swallowed up in the will of God."—
Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pp. 100, 101.

9. Explain the principle that the apostle Paul expressed in 2 Corin-
   thians 12:10.



   The apostle Paul did not enjoy pain and suffering but was glad he could
share in the sufferings of Christ. In times of trial and pain he recognized
more fully his total dependence upon the Lord. After he had prayed three
times for his "thorn in the flesh" to be removed (2 Cor. 12:7, 8), he was
16
       A Star to Guide the Humble                                 October 12
      the means by which I am led to rely more fully upon the Source of my
      power."

WED   10. What are some prerequisites for answered prayer? Matt. 7:7;
          1 John 3:22; 5:14, 15. Under what circumstances will God not
          answer our prayers? James 4:3; Ps. 66:18.



         Before we ask, we must realize our need. This is one of the first condi-
      tions of effective prayer. Cherished sin renders it impossible for God to
      answer our prayers. When we put away sin and trust the Lord to answer us,
      we can be assured that He will give us whatever is for our best good. The
      spirit of love and forgiveness in our hearts prepares us to receive God's
      blessing.

      11. For what can we trust God? Phil. 4:19 (Ps. 37:4; 23:1).



         As shortsighted human beings we tend to ask for things that would do
      us more harm than good. The beautiful truth is that God may deny us what
      we have asked for, but in its place He will give us that which is best for us.
      Our faith should not fail when our prayers are not immediately answered.
      From His divine perspective the Lord is able to see perfectly the results for
      us of any course of action. He knows best where we should work, with
      whom we should associate closely, where we should live, and what in-
      fluences are most likely to prepare us effectively to spend eternity with
      Him. Trust Him!

         God supplies our needs. After accepting Christ and the advent mes-
      sage, a young man went to college to prepare for the ministry. Halfway
      through the year he realized that he did not have enough money to con-
      tinue. Earnestly he shared with a religion teacher his deep conviction that
      he should be a minister. But how could he ever fulfill the Lord's will if he
      could not afford an education? The teacher encouraged the student to
      remain in college for two more weeks, and they both agreed to take the
      young man's financial need to the Lord every day. At the end of the two
      weeks the student received a letter containing a check for the amount he
      needed to continue in college. "And my God will meet all your needs
      according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus" (Phil. 4:19, NIV).

      12. What special blessing can be claimed by those who trust in the
          Lord? Prov. 16:9 (compare Ps. 32:8).



         The various translations of Proverbs 16:9 enable us to grasp the full
      significance of the divine promise: "You may make your plans, but God
      directs your actions" (TEV). "A man's mind plans his way, but the Lord
      directs his steps and makes them sure" (Amplified).
                                                                                 17

   The various translations of Proverbs 16:9 enable us to grasp the full
significance of the divine promise: "You may make your plans, but God
directs your actions" (TEV). "A man's mind plans his way, but the Lord
directs his steps and makes them sure" (Amplified).
   Of course, there is a definite condition to such guidance. We can expect
it when we are committed to Christ and, by His grace, doing His will.
Proverbs 16:8 reads: "Better a little with righteousness than much gain
with injustice" (Prov. 16:8, NIV).

13. How only can we be assured that our plans in life will be success-
    ful? Prov. 16:3 (contrast 16:25; 19:3).



   The Revised Standard Version translates the passage: "Commit your
work to the Lord, and your plans will be established." God's plans for our
lives can be destroyed by our determination to have our own way. When
our wills are merged in Christ's, His plans for us become our plans for
ourselves. The Holy Spirit instructs us as to the best course to follow in
every situation. By accepting His direction our work and our plans will be
successful.

14. What figure of speech is used to describe God's work for those
    who put their trust in Him? Prov. 30:5 (compare 18:10; 21:31).



   Self-preservation is one of the strongest human instincts. It motivates
mankind to employ all manner of devices to provide protection from
such feared events as accident, assault, lawsuit, disease, and death. In-
surance of every kind is bought in the name of reducing risks. Although
we are instructed to be careful custodians of all the Lord has committed
to our care, apart from His intervention in our lives we have no lasting
security.
   In the difficult times preceding the second coming of Jesus, no human
means of protection will be adequate. We must exercise complete trust in
the Lord. (See Ps. 91:1-7.)

HOW IS MY "TQ" (TRUST QUOTIENT)?
   • To what extent have I cooperated with God in the growth of my
faith?
   • How can I develop stronger faith in the Lord to direct me in the
practical affairs of daily life?
   • How can I resist those influences that threaten to destroy my trust in
Christ?
   • What personal testimony can I give to the Lord's guidance and bless-
ing for those who put their complete trust in Him?

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Consider the following
counsel regarding the importance of trust in the Lord (Ps. 37:3, 5; 118:8;
Isa. 26:4) and the danger of distrust (Jer. 5:17; 17:5; Isa. 30:1, 2).

   "If we would give more expression to our faith, rejoice more in the
blessings that we know we have—the great mercy and love of God—we
should have more faith and greater joy. No tongue can express, no finite
mind can conceive, the blessing that results from appreciating the good-
ness and love of God."—Sons and Daughters of God, p. 122.
   "Jesus does not release us from the necessity of effort, but He teaches
that we are to make Him first and last and best in everything. We are to
engage in no business, follow no pursuit, seek no pleasure, that would
hinder the outworking of His righteousness in our character and life."—
Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 99.

SUMMARY: It is impossible for a proud heart to trust in God. But only
He has the solutions for our personal and corporate problems. His bless-
ings are available in abundance as we ask and submit ourselves to His
perfect and gracious will.

SAB      WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHARACTER
PM    AND REPUTATION? We have all heard that a good name is a precious
      thing. What is a "good name"? Is a good name the same as a good
      character? Is our good character destroyed when our good name is slan-
      dered? What can we learn from the relationship between character and
      reputation in human experience that will enable us to understand God's
      concern in the great controversy? And how will that understanding help us
      relate to the crises in our lives?
         We will look for answers to these questions in the Word of God, and
      especially in the book of Proverbs.

      MEMORY TEXT: "A good name is rather to be chosen than great
      riches, and loving favour rather than silver and gold" (Proverbs 22:1).

      THEME: It is more important to do what is right than to have a good
      reputation.

        11. The Value of a Good Name (Prov. 22:1).

      I. PRIDE GOES BEFORE A FALL (Prov. 16:18).

         Pride versus self-worth. Self-esteem is a subject much talked and writ-
      ten about these days. As evidence that a person should love himself, Chris-
      tian authors often cite Christ's words, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
      thyself."
         It is true that when one no longer doubts his own self-worth, he is more
      likely to love others. However, it seems that self-love and a sense of
      self-worth have become involved in a semantic tangle, in which precise
      meanings have become confused. Some authors extol the virtues of self-re-
      spect in a manner suggesting that personal pride is essential to achieve-
      ment and success. Others regard self-respect as a humble recognition of
      self-worth, despite realistic awareness of one's weaknesses.

        What I Am Versus What You Think I Am October 19
si   1. What did self-esteem do for Lucifer? Eze. 28:13-19 (compare Isa.
         14:12-17).



          When one's self-esteem blurs supreme love and respect for God, the
      result is self-idolatry. Awareness of our dependence upon the Creator for
      life, health, talent, wealth, and success in life preserves a realistic view of
      our own worth in relation to other created beings. Lucifer's self-esteem
      ceased to be a legitimate sense of self-worth; it became unholy self-love,
      the most insidious disease ever to afflict God's creation.

         Give an example from your own experience that illustrates the
      truth found in Proverbs 16:18 and 18:12.

      2. What results of pride are emphasized by the following passages?

         Prov. 11:2

         Prov. 13:10, 18

         Prov. 15:25

         Prov. 17:19

         The results of pride illustrated:
         • Nebuchadnezzar responded positively to Daniel's message (Dan.
      2:47). He acknowledged that Daniel's God is the supreme Deity. When the
      three faithful Hebrews were unharmed in the fiery furnace, Nebuchadnez-
      zar commanded, "Servants of the most high God, come out!" (Dan. 3:26,
      NIV). He proclaimed, "Praise be to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and
      Abednego. . . . For no other god can save in this way" (Dan. 3:28, 29,
      NIV).
         Some time later Nebuchadnezzar forgot the true God and took to him-
      self the credit for his prosperity and success as a ruler: " 'Is not this the
      great Babylon I have built as the royal residence, by my mighty power and
      for the glory of my majesty?' The words were still on his lips when a voice
      came from heaven . . . 'Your royal authority has been taken from you' "
      (Dan. 4:30, 31, NIV). For seven years he suffered a period of insanity.
         • Herod Agrippa I, grandson of Herod the Great, was hailed by the
      people of Tyre and Sidon as a god (Acts 12:22). "Immediately, because
      Herod did not give praise to God, an angel of the Lord struck him down,
      and he was eaten by worms and died" (verse 23, NIV).
         • The disciples of Jesus spent considerable time arguing "which of
      them was to be regarded as the greatest" (Luke 22:24, NIV). This desire
      for self-exaltation kept them spiritually weak and disqualified them for the
      test of their faith at the time of Jesus' trial and crucifixion.

MON   3. Why is pride so objectionable to God? Matt. 11:29; Prov. 6:16, 17
         (compare Prov. 8:13; 16:5; 21:4).

                                                                                   21
 Lesson 3                                                    October 19
   "God does not regard all sins as of equal magnitude; there are degrees
of guilt in His estimation, . . . but however trifling this or that wrong act
may seem in the eyes of men, no sin is small in the eyes of God. . . . The
drunkard is despised, and is told that his sin will exclude him from heaven;
while pride, selfishness, and covetousness too often go unrebuked. But
these are sins that are especially offensive to God; for they are contrary to
the benevolence of His character. . . . He who falls into some of the grosser
sins may feel a sense of his shame and poverty and his need of the grace of
Christ; but pride feels no need, and so it closes the heart against Christ and
the blessings He came to give."—Steps to Christ, p. 30.

4. In what manner does pride often express itself? Prov. 20:6; 26:12
   (compare Prov. 25:27; 27:2).


   "The Pharisee proclaimed his goodness at the corner of the streets;
yes—even in the presence of his God. Such is the blindness of a self-
deceiving heart! Lord! teach me to remember—ghat which is highly
esteemed among men is detestable in the sight of God [Luke 16:15].' "—
Bridges, A Modern Study in the Book of Proverbs (Michigan: Mott Media,
1978), p. 403.
5. In what ways do Christians sometimes ignore the counsel con-
   tained in Proverbs 25:6, 7? Compare Luke 14:7-11.


  In order to be honored by Heaven, we must be willing to sacrifice the
honor of men. Love of worldly acclaim could have destroyed the work of
some of the world's greatest leaders. Moses was noted for meekness,
Daniel for dependence upon his God, and Paul for willingness to sacrifice
position and honor for the cause of Jesus Christ.
  To admit any "inferiority" is difficult for the average person. Yet,
common sense should tell us that there is always someone, somewhere,
who exceeds us in some way.
  Pride, competition, and combativeness do sometimes "get things
done," but a far better way is to strive to be all that one can be for God.
The honor of Heaven is of infinitely greater value than the plaudits of
humanity.

6. What is another way in which pride is sometimes manifested?
   Prov. 31:30 (compare 1 Tim. 2:9, 10; 1 Peter 3:3, 4).


   Pride of appearance and love of display can destroy all that is lovely in
character. Devotion to fashion sometimes so absorbs the mind and heart
that no room is left for the important aspects of life. Fashion often dictates
styles that are inappropriate for the refined, God-fearing, self-respecting
person. "No Christian can conform to the demoralizing fashions of the
22
       What I Am Versus What You Think I Am October 19
      world without imperiling his soul's salvation."—Child Guidance, p. 433.
         At the other extreme are persons who think it a virtue to dress in an
      untidy, tasteless manner. "When we lose taste for order and neatness in
      dress, we virtually leave the truth; for the truth never degrades but ele-
      vates."—Child Guidance, pp. 419, 420.

      7. What truth stated in the book of Proverbs was illustrated by
         Jesus' life? Prov. 16:19; 22:4; Phil. 2:5-9.



         Pride is dishonoring to God. So also is false humility. True humility
      recognizes need and fulfills God's purpose by accepting His grace and
      depending on His strength. False humility does not acknowledge one's
      ability or worth. Such an attitude effectively robs its possessor of the joy of
      knowing that he is loved and valued. False humility depreciates God-given
      talents. It leads an individual to the distorted idea that he or she is in-
      capable of doing anything effectively. False humility robs God of the
      honor and service due Him.

         In my attitudes to others, how do I sometimes demonstrate personal
      pride? How would my relationships with others be improved if, by
      Christ's grace, I learned to be humble? If pride is blinding, how does
      a person come to see his need? What internal work am I neglecting
      that allows pride to develop and manifest itself?
WED   11. THE VALUE OF A GOOD NAME (Prov. 22:1).

         Reputation or wealth? Someone has said, "Given the choice between
      the name of a great company and its material assets, I would choose the
      name." Why? Without the name, the assets would remain at a fixed value
      or even depreciate, whereas the name itself could rebuild the assets lost,
      and then gain more.

      8. What value did Solomon place on "a good name"? Prov. 22:1.



         What is a good name? Hebrew poetry is known for parallelism and
      pun rather than for rhyme. In parallelism a statement is made twice, but
      expressed differently the second time. Besides adding interest, a deeper
      understanding of the subject is achieved by a comparison of the parallel
      phrases. For instance, in Proverbs 22:1 "great riches" is echoed in "silver
      and gold," and "a good name" finds its counterpart in "loving favour."
      Solomon was not referring to a business deal. He was extolling the excel-
      lence of a good character.

         In Bible times a name was more than a mere title or identification. It
      represented reputation or character. It often told who you were, what you
      were like, what you had done, and even what you might become. (See
      Gen. 16:11; 17:5, 15; 32:28.) Some family names today reflect this:
                                                                                   23
 Lesson 3                                                   October 19
Cooper made barrels, Fuller washed clothes, Smith made the anvil ring in
the blacksmith shop and fashioned useful implements, and of course John-
son was the son of John.
   "The Hebrews, like other ancient Near Eastern peoples, attached great
significance to personal names. Their names had a literal meaning some-
times symbolic of the character and personality of the one it designated, and
sometimes reflecting the moods or feelings of the one giving the name.. ..
   "Perhaps the most popular type of name among the Israelites was one
that contained some reference to the true God. Such a name was often a
pious declaration of faith."—SDA Bible Dictionary, article, "Name."
   So we find Joel ("Yahweh is God"), Elijah ("Yahweh is my God"),
Nathanael ("God has given"), and Ishmael ("God hears").

9. Why does the third commandment direct us to revere the name
    of God (Ex. 20:7)? Lev. 22:2 (compare Ex. 3:13-15; 34:5-7).



   God's name is a symbol of His infinitely holy character. When we
misuse His name we depreciate His character. Using the Lord's name
carelessly or as an exclamation demonstrates lack of love and respect for
Him. as well as lack of trust in Him.

    Do not dishonor God. "This commandment not only prohibits false
oaths and common swearing, but it forbids us to use the name of God in a
light or careless manner, without regard to its awful significance. By the
thoughtless mention of God in common conversation, by appeals to Him in
trivial matters, and by the frequent and thoughtless repetition of His name,
we dishonor Him."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 306, 307.

10. In what other ways can God's name be taken in vain? Prov. 30:9;
    14:31.



    When you become a Christian, you take Christ's name. "God sends you
into the world as His representative. In every act of life you are to make
manifest the name of God. . . . You cannot hallow His name, you cannot
represent Him to the world, unless in life and character you represent the
very life and character of God. This you can do only through the accep-
tance of the grace and righteousness of Christ."
    "It is because men take upon themselves the name of Christ, while in
life they deny His character, that Christianity has so little power in the
world."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pp. 107, 137.

11. What statement does God make regarding His character? Mal.
    3:6 (compare Heb. 13:8; James 1:17).



     Character and reputation are not the same. God's character is what
24
 What I Am Versus What You Think I Am October 19
He is, demonstrated by how He thinks and acts toward those whom He has
created. His perfectly holy character is changeless. As a transcript of His
character His law is also perfect. To alter any feature of His character or
His government would be to flaw it. This He will not do, and anyone else
cannot do.
   God's reputation is an entirely different matter. Lucifer gave God a bad
reputation with some created beings by misrepresenting His character.
Stirred by jealousy, he charged God with being arbitrary, harsh, unfair, and
untruthful. He argued that if he himself were in control, things would be
different.
   In order to reveal the true nature of Satan's work, God must both allow
sin to become fully developed, and demonstrate His own character in
contrast to that of Satan. (See The Great Controversy, pp. 495-497; The
Desire of Ages, p. 22.)

   The controversy begun in heaven continues here on earth. In each
individual the battle rages. We are each given the freedom to choose
whose character will be demonstrated in our life, God's or Satan's. The
plan of salvation involves more than our personal redemption, although
that is a wonderful aspect of it. God wants to do more than just proclaim
us righteous (forgive our past sin), He wants to make us righteous (restore
us). Through the grace and power that Jesus bought for us at Calvary, His
character can be lived out in the life of the believer. Thus it is our privilege
to reveal to angels and to men the glory of God's character. (See John
17:22.) Though others may give us a bad reputation, they can never give us
a bad character.

12. What will symbolize our experience? Isa. 62:2 (compare Rev.
    2:17; 3:12).



   A young bridegroom, whose bride had willingly taken his name, gave
her for a wedding present a small white stone inscribed with her new
name. That name is symbolic of their experience. All her friends know her
name. But the relationship, the precious and intimate friendship that she
enjoys with her husband, can be known and understood by no other.
   Each overcomer through Christ's grace will have just such a unique, per-
sonal relationship with Him. The relationship begins now as we daily come
to know Him more fully and delight in reflecting His character to others.

      character will endure to eternity. God gives you intelligence and a reason-
      ing mind, whereby you may grasp His promises; and Jesus is ready to help
      you in forming a strong, symmetrical character. Those who possess such a
      character need never become discouraged because they have not success in
      worldly affairs. They 'are the light of the world.' Satan cannot destroy or
      make of none effect the light that shines forth from them."—Testimonies,
      vol. 5, p. 579.

      SUMMARY: A good name is a priceless treasure. It increases the effec-
      tiveness of our witness. Reputation is easily destroyed by gossip or slander.
      But slander does not have to destroy character. The slander of God's
      character by the evil one and those who follow him has in no way changed
      His perfect purity and infinitely loving disposition. What one really is, is
      more important than what anyone thinks. The character that Christ lives
      out through us will stand the test of time and eternity.

SAB      CHRIST'S POWER IS THE SOURCE OF SPIRITUAL HEALTH.
PM
      Even as righteousness involves much more than refraining from evil, so
      health is more than the absence of disease. It encompasses the well-being
      of all our capabilities. To gain everything the world has to offer at the
      expense of health is to trade life and happiness for things of inferior value.
      We should guard health as sacredly as character.
         Physical and spiritual health can be destroyed in many different
      ways. By tempting us to many kinds of intemperance, Satan seeks to
      destroy our mental, moral, and physical powers. The crafty enemy used
      many temptations to entrap Jesus, but failed every time, because Jesus
      relied fully on His Father's strength. Even the masterful forms in which the
      temptations of appetite, presumption, and covetousness came to Him were
      totally unsuccessful.
         The rest of humanity has been tragically responsive to evil. Noah
      sought refuge in strong drink, Abraham capitulated to dishonesty and self-
      dependence, David fell into immorality, Moses lost his temper, Peter con-
      tradicted his faith, the Corinthian Christians gave loyalty to men instead of
      to Christ, and the Galatians substituted a man-made gospel for the gospel
      of Jesus Christ.
          The bright side to the picture is that Satan is a defeated foe. When we
      unite our weakness to God's might, we are more than a match for the
      sophistries of the evil one.

      MEMORY TEXT: "The highway of the upright is to depart from
      evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul" (Proverbs 16:17).

      THEME: Physical, mental, and spiritual health can be maintained as we
      practice temperance in all things, overcoming temptation through the
      power of Christ.

I. HEALTH AND TEMPERANCE (Prov. 15:24).

   What is temperance? Temperance is to health as mortar is to a brick
building. Without temperance one can neither build nor maintain health. In
times long past, temperance was a term used to refer almost exclusively to
total abstinence from alcoholic beverages. More recently we have under-
stood that "true temperance teaches us to dispense entirely with everything
hurtful and to use judiciously that which is healthful."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, p. 562.

1. What well-known reason does the apostle Paul give for taking care
   of one's body? 1 Cor. 6:19, 20 (compare 3:16, 17).



   "From eternal ages it was God's purpose that every created being, from
the bright and holy seraph to man, should be a temple for the indwelling of
the Creator. Because of sin, humanity ceased to be a temple for God.
Darkened and defiled by evil, the heart of man no longer revealed the glory
of the Divine One. But by the incarnation of the Son of God, the purpose
of Heaven is fulfilled. God dwells in humanity, and through saving grace
the heart of man becomes again His temple."—The Desire of Ages, p. 161.
   "Our very bodies are not our own, to treat as we please, to cripple by
habits that lead to decay, making it impossible to render to God perfect
service. Our lives and all our faculties belong to Him."—Counsels on Diet
and Food, p. 56.

2. What close relationship between the mind and body is revealed in
   the following verses? Prov. 17:22; 18:14.



   Modern science is discovering that the bonds between the mind and the
body are much closer than previously thought. What affects the body af-
fects the mind, and vice versa. Mental power is dependent on physical
health, and physical well-being is fostered by a mind at peace. Spiritual
power is related to both mental and physical health. As we realize that the
brain is the only medium of communication between God and man, and
that the mind is affected by the body, the importance of temperance comes
into proper focus.

   Health for God's sake. Health for the sake of health is at best tem-
porary. Health in the framework of our relationship to God has implica-
tions bearing on eternity. To love the Lord with all the heart, soul, mind,
and strength (Mark 12:30) puts us under obligation to keep each of these in
the best condition possible. If we value our friendship with God we will
not tolerate anything that will hinder or obstruct it. And if we truly trust
and admire Him, we will want all our powers to be in the most efficient
working order, that we might be effective representatives of His love and
purity.

3. What lesson can we learn from the following verses? Prov. 25:16,
   17, 27.



   The New International Version translates Proverbs 25:27: "It is not
good to eat too much honey, nor is it honorable to seek one's own
honor." Real wisdom enhances every area of our lives. These passages
of scripture illustrate the principle of moderation in that which is good.
Whether in eating, playing, visiting, or in the exercise of personal ambi-
tion, the practice of moderation tends to health and good relations with
one's neighbors.

4. What warnings regarding intemperance are emphasized in Pro-
   verbs 20:1; 23:20, 21, 29-32?


   It is a well-documented fact that alcohol impairs both the mental and
physical processes. It seems to the drinker that alcohol lifts him above the
cares of reality into a world of happiness, strength, and intelligence. In
truth the opposite is taking place!
   Leaders are especially warned that alcohol will destroy their capacity to
make good judgments and administer wisely. (See Prov. 31:4, 5.)

   Intemperance a devilish design. "Satan gathered the fallen angels
together to devise some way of doing the most possible evil to the human
family. One proposition after another was made, till finally Satan himself
thought of a plan. He would take the fruit of the vine, also wheat, and other
things given by God as food, and would convert them into poisons, which
would ruin man's physical, mental, and moral powers, and so overcome
the senses that Satan should have full control."—Temperance, p. 12.

   The example of Roger Williams. When Roger Williams escaped from
the Massachusetts Bay Company and found asylum with the Indians, he set
up his own colony of Rhode Island. One of the wisest laws he instituted was
that regarding "fire water." The law forbade anyone except himself to give
alcohol to the Indians, and he was allowed to dispense it only as medicine.

   Seventh-day Adventists accept the standard of total abstinence
from alcohol. "Since alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and the irresponsible
use of drugs and narcotics are harmful to our bodies, we are to abstain
from them as well. Instead, we are to engage in whatever brings our
thoughts and bodies into the discipline of Christ, who desires our whole-
someness, joy, and goodness."—Seventh-day Adventist Yearbook, 1989,
P- 7-
5. What results from choosing "the way of life"? Prov. 15:24.



   A little alcohol destroys efficiency, a lot destroys life. "One ounce of
                                                                          29
 Lesson 4                                                   October 26
alcohol retards muscular reaction 17.4 percent; increases time required to
make a decision 9.7 percent; increases errors due to lack of attention 35.3
percent, and due to lack of muscular coordination 59.7 percent."—Paul
Harvey.
   "Drunkenness has killed more men than all of history's wars."—
General Pershing.
   "Drink is a cancer in human society, eating out its vitals and threaten-
ing its destruction."—Abraham Lincoln.
   "It is my judgment that because of the devastating problem that alco-
holism has become in America, it is better for Christians to be tee-
totalers."—Billy Graham.

   Apply the message to yourself. Am I addicted to an intemperate
habit that is keeping me from having a vital relationship with Christ?
What steps must I take to cooperate with Christ's overcoming power?
(See 1 John 1:9; 1 John 5:2-5; Jude 24.)

11. TEMPTATION TO SEXUAL LUST (Prov. 5:3-9).

6. How can we protect ourselves from temptation to sexual immoral-
   ity? Prov. 5:3-9 (compare 4:14, 15).



    In the cities of the world today, sexual indulgence is brazenly advertised
as a normal aspect of human existence. Television programs, films, ma-
gazines, newspapers, theatrical performances, and billboard ads capitalize
on the human fascination with physical beauty and sexual satisfaction. For
the masses of humanity, long gone is the biblical principle that sex is a gift
of God to be exercised only within happy marriage. Long gone is the
principle taught by Jesus that covetous thought regarding the opposite sex
is sin.

   How do you as a Christian cope with the sexual bombardment of
the modern world? Do you find yourself unconsciously tolerating atti-
tudes and practices that you cannot change? Do you give in to sexual
indulgence or do you resist it? How would you suggest that a sexually
motivated person control his or her natural appetites?

   "It is not safe for us to linger to contemplate the advantages to be
reaped through yielding to Satan's suggestions. . . . If we venture on
Satan's ground we have no assurance of protection from his power. So far
as in us lies, we should close every avenue by which the tempter may find
access to us."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 118.

7. What is the first step toward going astray in the wrong paths?
   Prov. 7:5-25 (compare James 1:14).



     Our own heart turns traitor and wars against us! And what person can
30
 Spiritual Preventive Medicine                              October 26
change the heart? Our imaginations, our physical, emotional, and psycho-
logical impulses urge us to foster desires that are impure and contrary to
God's will. Not all the power of brain or brawn can transform our natural
tendencies and render us able to resist the lure that leads to death. Only
God can heal us.

8. According to Solomon, what delivers a person from evil? Prov.
   16:6, 16, 17; 7:1-5 (compare 2:10-12, 16-20; 13:14; 14:16).



   The power of faith. Fear is sometimes justified. A healthy respect for
the danger ahead will lead a wise person to avoid it if at all possible. But
in the final analysis victory over temptation to moral impurity is found
only in heart fellowship with Christ. "This is the victory that overcometh
the world, even our faith" (1 John 5:4). When confronted by almost over-
mastering temptation, we must ask Jesus for the victory. (See Matt. 7:7, 8.)
He is always willing to give power to those who are tempted. Having
asked, we must next praise Him for hearing and answering our prayer. "In
every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concern-
ing you" (1 Thess. 5:18). Praise demonstrates faith! After asking for
power to overcome, we must immediately praise the Lord for answering.
And He does answer!

   "Keep my words as the daily means of life. Sir Matthew Hale told his
children, 'If I omit reading a portion of Scripture in the morning, it never
goes well with me through the day.' Treasure it up carefully, not on our
shelves, but in our hearts. Let the whole Word of God be our precious
treasure. Receive the promises from His grace with simple trust and the
commandments from His holiness with ready obedience. Stand with your
eye in the land of promise; but with your feet 'on level ground.' . . . If
wisdom is not loved, lust will be indulged. The Bible therefore—not
merely read, but the cherished object of familiar conversation—proves a
sacred exorcist to expel the power of evil."—Charles Bridges, The Book of
Proverbs, pp. 82, 83.

9. What counsel are we given concerning our associates? Prov. 14:7
   (compare 16:29, 30; 22:24, 25).



   No man is an island. We are influenced negatively or positively by our
associates. Goethe stated, "We are shaped and fashioned by the things we
love," and certainly that is true regarding the people we love. While we
are not to be exclusive in our social lives, we should form our closest
friendships with those who will be a help on our journey, rather than a
hindrance. (See 2 Cor. 6:14.)
   In a divided family or on the job with non-Christians it is not always
possible to avoid situations to which we would rather not be exposed. With
the Lord in our hearts, we can be guarded and our minds rendered imper-
vious to wrong influences.
                                                                           31
        Lesson 4                                                  October 26
WED   10. What is the meaning of "lead us not into temptation" (Matt.
          6:13)? James 1:2, 3, 13-15.



         "Temptation is enticement to sin, and this does not proceed from God,
      but from Satan and from the evil of our own hearts. . . . He [God] permits
      us to encounter obstacles, persecution, and hardships, not as a curse, but as
      the greatest blessing of our lives. Every temptation resisted, every trial
      bravely borne, gives us a new experience and advances us in the work of
      character building. The soul that through divine power resists temptation
      reveals to the world and to the heavenly universe the efficiency of the
      grace of Christ. . . .
         "We should pray that God will not permit us to be brought where we
      shall be drawn away by the desires of our own evil hearts. In offering the
      prayer that Christ has given, we surrender ourselves to the guidance of
      God, asking Him to lead us in safe paths. We cannot offer this prayer in
      sincerity, and yet decide to walk in any way of our own choosing."—
      Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pp. 116-118.

         The Lord promises to deliver the tempted one (1 Cor. 10:13).
      "When the soul surrenders itself to Christ, a new power takes possession
      of the new heart. . . . It is a supernatural work, bringing a supernatural
      element into human nature. The soul that is yielded to Christ becomes His
      own fortress, which He holds in a revolted world, and He intends that no
      authority shall be known in it but His own. A soul thus kept in possession
      by the heavenly agencies is impregnable to the assaults of Satan. But
      unless we do yield ourselves to the control of Christ, we shall be domi-
      nated by the wicked one. . . . We may leave off many bad habits, for the
      time we may part company with Satan; but without a vital connection with
      God, through the surrender of ourselves to Him moment by moment, we
      shall be overcome."—The Desire of Ages, p. 324.

      11. How does Proverbs 23:17 portray the constant communion be-
          tween the true believer and his Lord?



         The secret of a radiant Christian life is constant awareness of Christ's
      presence. Jesus promised to be with us always (Matt. 28:20), and He
      always keeps His promises. In the rush of daily life, amid the unholy
      confusion of a world of sin, we may know that our Lord walks beside us
      and dwells in our hearts by the Holy Spirit. Unspoken communion as well
      as spoken communion with Him is a great source of strength.

      12. What results from keeping one's "way"? Prov. 16:17; 13:14.



        The word soul used in Proverbs 16:17 comes from the Hebrew nephesh,
      which refers to a living being in totality, including the physical self. The
      32
 Spiritual Preventive Medicine                                October 26
preservation of life, in the ultimate sense of living with God for eternity, is
undoubtedly what Solomon had in mind. Yet even in this present world,
"to depart from evil" leads to greater happiness and prosperity—and even
to the preservation of this mortal life.

HOW DOES THIS APPLY TO ME?
   • How can I better "glorify God" in my body?
   • To what extent am I aware of the relationship between my mind and
my body?
   • Have I allowed intemperance in any line, such as eating, drinking,
study, work, play, or sex, to rob me of my fullest potential?
   • When was the last time I avoided temptation?
   • Have I determined, by the power of God, to defeat the next tempta-
tion that comes to me?
   • Do I understand the practical necessity for a "faith that works," in
the context of the great controversy?

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: On the power of Christ to
overcome sin in our lives study Ps. 44:5; Rom. 6:11-13; 8:37; 2 Cor. 10:5;
Jude 24; Rev. 12:11.
   "In all ages, temptations appealing to the physical nature have been
most effectual in corrupting and degrading mankind. Through intemper-
ance, Satan works to destroy the mental and moral powers that God gave
to man as a priceless endowment. Thus it becomes impossible for men to
appreciate things of eternal worth. Through sensual indulgence, Satan
seeks to blot from the soul every likeness to God."—The Desire of Ages,
p. 122. (See also p. 125; Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 92; The
Acts of the Apostles, p. 518.)

SUMMARY: "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." This is
true in the physical world; it is true also in the spiritual realm. It is easier
(and more comfortable) to live temperately and stay healthy, than to regain
health once it is lost. Likewise, it is less complicated to avoid or resist
temptation to evil deeds than to endeavor to extricate oneself, and every-
one else who may be involved, from the trauma resulting from yielding to
temptation.

      October 27—November 2



        Your Choices Determine
             Your Destiny
SAB       GOD'S LAW IS BINDING UPON ALL CREATION. Being such a
PM    practical book, Proverbs tends to deal with absolutes and ultimates. In
      effect it says to us, "This is what will happen if you do that." We see this
      in its references to the great theme of law. The guidelines for human life,
      as well as the principles governing matter and energy, are in accordance
      with laws given by the Creator.
          Of course there are always some who choose to disregard law—Solo-
      mon calls them "fools." In their supposed quest for freedom, they become
      victims and captives. God's law cannot be broken with impunity. Because
      it stands forever, the results of disregarding it are inevitable.

      MEMORY TEXT: "Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom: but
      a man of understanding walketh uprightly" (Proverbs 15:21).

      THEME: The salvation or eternal loss of each individual ultimately de-
      pends upon his willingness or unwillingness to enter into fellowship with
      God that results in conformity to His holy law.

      OUTLINE:
         I. The Divine Standard (Prov. 3:1-7).
        11. The Folly of Lawlessness (Prov. 15:21).
       I11. Reaping Time (Prov. 22:8).

      I. THE DIVINE STANDARD (Prov. 3:1-7).

         What is law? The term law evokes different mental images in different
      people. Some envision row upon row of massive bound volumes in an
      attorney's library, while others imagine a law enforcement officer behind
      them with lights swirling and siren screaming. To others it brings to mind
      discussions regarding the laws in the Bible, whether moral or ceremonial.
      Still others are fascinated by the laws that govern the natural world.
         Which of these are the laws of God? To which are we rightfully
      amenable?

1. According to the book of Proverbs, why is it important to live by
   God's law? By what means can we obey it?

  Prov. 3:1-7

  Prov. 4:2-4

  Prov. 6:20-23

  Prov. 7:1-4

   Prov. 13:13-15

   Our Father expresses His concern. In the book of Proverbs we are
listening to a wise father teaching his child about the law of God. He
desires to bring his child into right relation with God and neighbors. (Com-
pare Deut. 6:3-9.) Mothers are included as teachers of the law in Proverbs,
as are all adults in Israel. Through such teaching the great truths of God's
Word are impressed upon the minds of the young, never to be erased.

    Obedience by faith. "He that keepeth the law, happy is he" (Prov.
29:18). Some Bible students have concluded that the Old Testament pre-
sents law as the means of salvation, while the New Testament presents
grace. Such a distinction is artificial and unbiblical. God's holy law that is
extolled in Proverbs 3:1-4 can be obeyed only by "trust in the Lord"
(verse 5). As the believer acknowledges the Lord in all his or her ways,
"he shall direct thy paths" (verse 6). Only the one who fears the Lord is
able to "depart from evil" (verse 7). Fear of the Lord (reverence for Him)
is the kind of living faith of which the New Testament speaks. It results in
obedience to God's law. (See Rom. 3:31.)

2. What attributes of the law of God does Paul mention in Romans
   7:12, 14?



   All of God's laws work in harmony with each other and reveal His
character of love and the order in His kingdom. The laws of nature are the
laws of God as verily as is the Decalogue. Obviously, they were in opera-
tion long before man was fully aware of their existence. Sir Isaac Newton
discovered and explained the great laws of motion by which our world
operates. But we remember the Creator, the all-wise and all-powerful God,
who is the Originator of all such laws. No conflict exists between true
religion and true science, for God is the Author of both.

3. How is the working of God's law illustrated? Ps. 19:1-3, 7 (com-
   pare 40:26).



   The glory of God's character is revealed in His handiwork, both in the
                                                                           35
        Lesson 5                                                 November 2
      tangible objects of His creation and in the laws of their operation. As it was
      originally intended to function, nature reflects the infinite love of God.
         "The whole natural world is designed to be an interpreter of the things
      of God. . . .
         "In the natural world, God has placed in the hands of the children of men
      the key to the treasure house of His word. The unseen is illustrated by the
      seen; divine wisdom, eternal truth, infinite grace, are understood by the
      things that God has made."—Counsels to Parents and Teachers, pp. 186,
      187.
         "We would do well to read often the nineteenth psalm that we may
      understand how the Lord binds up His law with His created works."—
      SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1143.

MON   4. Describe the law found in Romans 6:23.



         To choose sin is to choose death. Here we see that just as a thistle lies
      dormant in its seed, so death is inherently bound up in sin. The declaration
      "The soul that sinneth, it shall die" (Eze. 18:4) is not a threat of punish-
      ment, but a warning of natural consequences come to full fruit. While God
      desires obedience born of love rather than of fear, at the same time He
      wants us to be able to make choices intelligently. He tells us what will be
      the ultimate consequence of obedience and disobedience, and leaves us
      free to decide between the two.

      5. What has God placed as a protection around His faithful children?
         Isa. 5:1, 2; Matt. 21:33.



         Song of the vineyard. Both the song and the parable tell of a vineyard
      planted with choice vines and endowed with every provision that it might
      flourish and prosper. Hedge and wall protected it from destruction by wild
      or domestic grazing animals. The wall undoubtedly had been built of the
      abundant field stones. Removal of the hedge and breaking down of the
      wall would expose the vineyard to the raids of enemies and destruction by
      wild animals.

         The vineyard represented God's chosen people, Israel. "To this
      people were committed the oracles of God. They were hedged about by the
      precepts of His law, the everlasting principles of truth, justice, and purity.
      Obedience to these principles was to be their protection, for it would save
      them from destroying themselves by sinful practices."—Chrisr s Object
      Lessons, pp. 287, 288.
         "That law of ten precepts of the greatest love that can be presented to
      man is the voice of God from heaven speaking to the soul in promise, 'This
      do, and you will not come under the dominion and control of Satan.'
      There is not a negative in that law, although it may appear thus. It is DO,
      and Live."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p.
      1105.
      36
 Your Choices Determine Your Destiny                    November 2
6. What provision has God made that we may be able to live accord-
   ing to His laws? Heb. 8:10; Eze. 36:26.



   God is not arbitrary, vengeful, and severe. His love no less than His
justice demands a consistent operation of law. Only against this back-
ground can we see in Proverbs an accurate picture of how sowing and
reaping really operate.

   What is your attitude to God? Do you believe that your happiness
and success are very important to Him? When things don't go your
way, do you tend to feel that God has withdrawn His love from you?
In the light of the message of Proverbs, how can you change such
negative feelings?

H. THE FOLLY OF LAWLESSNESS (Prov. 15:21).

   The abundance of fools. The book of Proverbs refers to fools, folly,
and foolishness in 84 verses. This is 9 percent of the 915 verses in the
book. Considering their emphasis, the authors of the Proverbs must have
been impressed with the seriousness of being a fool.

7. How does the fool relate to wisdom and understanding? Prov.
   17:16, 24 (compare 19:21; 23:9; 24:7).



   The New International Version translates Proverbs 17:16: "Of what use
is money in the hand of a fool, since he has no desire to get wisdom?"

   "In the gate he does not open his mouth" (Prov. 24:7, RSV). The
wise men and judges sat in counsel in the city gates, where business was
made legal and public matters were discussed. The fool would have noth-
ing to contribute.
   " 'Silence is the virtue of fools.' It is also a virtue of the wise (see
17:27). So a silent fool and a wise man can very seldom be told apart.
As long as a fool keeps quiet and nods wisely now and again, he can
enjoy the esteem held out to a wise man of sound judgment and few
words (17:28). But if the fool picked up this pearl of wisdom in a rare
moment of attention in the classroom, we should not be too hopeful that
he will keep his mouth shut. He could not possibly conceive that it ap-
plied to him. In any case, he has a happy knack of picking up words of
wisdom and letting them drop at all the wrong times and places. He
thinks he is being very clever when he can come out with a pithy say-
ing, but it invariably falls flat on its face (26:7) and makes not the
slightest impact (26:9). So even if the fool says something wise, his
sense of timing will usually give him away."—Kenneth T. Aitken,
Proverbs (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1986), pp. 98, 99.


                                                                        37
        Lesson 5                                               November 2
      8. Several things are mentioned as inappropriate for a fool. List the
         ones found in these verses: Prov. 19:10; 26:1, 7-9.



          Why would delight not be seemly for a fool? The Hebrew for "delight"
      is also translated "luxury" or "daintiness." The RSV translates Proverbs
      19:10: "It is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury." A fool evidently
      cannot resist the corrupting influence of delicate living. A fool takes
      delight in evil conduct. (See Prov. 10:23; 15:21; 18:2.) Prosperity is a
      catalyst for foolish behavior.

WED    9. What kind of "reward" is implied as being in store for the fool?
          Prov. 5:22, 23.



         The man who is wise in his own conceit cannot be told anything,
      however desperate the situation. His tendencies are graphically described
      in Proverbs. (See Prov. 17:12, 21; 26:6, 11, 12; 27:3.) He is beyond
      helping. Because the fool rejects God's love and law, there is no way for
      him to enjoy eternity with the righteous. When the Lord gives "every man
      according as his work shall be" (Rev. 22:12), the fool, being "an abomi-
      nation," will be shut out from the kingdom of glory. (See Rev. 21:27.)

         Obviously foolishness comes in many different forms. One charac-
      teristic shared by all fools is the tendency to substitute their own way
      for God's way. How would you work for a fool? What approaches
      would you use to wean a foolish person away from folly to the service
      of God?

      I11. REAPING TIME (Prov. 22:8).

         Two distinct pictures: can they be harmonized? In the book of Prov-
      erbs we find evidence for two distinct views of judgment theology. One
      places the responsibility for destruction on God; the other places the re-
      sponsibility on the sinner himself. Could it be that Solomon and the other
      writers of the Proverbs are presenting two sides of the same coin?

      10. What sharp contrast between the righteous and the wicked is
          typically drawn in Proverbs?

           Prov. 10:24, 25

           Prov. 10:27-30

           Prov. 11:6

         Contrasting consequences. God is the ultimate source of truth, right-
      eousness, and continuing life. To commit oneself to His principles, to
      choose righteousness as a way of life, to follow His directions for success
      38
 Your Choices Determine Your Destiny                       November 2
and live with Him in a fellowship of trust and admiration, is to connect
one's soul with the Infinite One and share in His life. On the other hand, to
choose a lifestyle opposed to the principles of life, to despise righteousness
and live for self, is to cut off one's soul from its source, a choice which
ultimately can end only in destruction.

11. What does an evil person seek? Why is this so serious? Prov.
    17:11; 1 Sam. 15:23.



   Resistance to God's authority takes us out of the orbit of His protective
grace. Whatever is not "of faith"—anything that is not in harmony with
an intelligent, admiring, trusting relationship with God—is sin, and can
only result in damage to one's character and relationships. (See Rom.
14:23.)

12. By what are all men judged, and according to what are they re-
    warded? Why? Prov. 12:14; 24:12 (compare James 2:12; Rev.
    22:12).



   We are saved by grace, not by works of the law. (See Rom. 3:20;
Gal. 2:16; Eph. 2:8-10.) But the experience of salvation by grace results in
obedience to God's law. (See Rom. 8:1-4.) Works of faith demonstrate that
Christ's grace is operating in the life to bring us into accord with the
righteous principles of His law. We are judged by the law, the great stand-
ard of righteousness, because Christ's grace has been made available as the
power to obey it. Our works are judged because grace makes possible
works that are acceptable to God.

   "The condition of eternal life is now just what it always has been—
just what it was in Paradise before the fall of our first parents—perfect
obedience to the law of God, perfect righteousness. If eternal life were
granted on any condition short of this, then the happiness of the whole
universe would be imperiled. The way would be open for sin, with all its
train of woe and misery, to be immortalized. . . .
   "We have no righteousness of our own with which to meet the claims
of the law of God. But Christ has made a way of escape for us. . . . If you
give yourself to Him, and accept Him as your Saviour, then, sinful as your
life may have been, for His sake you are accounted righteous. Christ's
charapter stands in place of your character; and you are accepted before
God just as if you had not sinned.
    "More than this, Christ changes the heart. He abides in your heart by
faith. You are to maintain this connection with Christ by faith and the
continual surrender of your will to Him; and so long as you do this, He will
work in you to will and to do according to His good pleasure.'' Steps to
Christ, pp. 62, 63.

13. Who destroys the wicked? Prov. 11:3; 15:25 (compare 21:12).
                                                                            39
       Lesson 5                                                 November 2
         It is in mercy to the universe that God will finally destroy the rejecters
     of His grace. (See The Great Controversy, p. 543.) In the final destruction
     of the wicked, God gives them over to the ultimate goal of their foolish-
     ness, the annihilation of self. They themselves must bear the ultimate re-
     sponsibility for their destruction. God Himself will punish them for their
     ways (2 Thess. 1:7, 8), and then by His own act He justly gives them the
     ultimate curse of death (Rev. 20:9).

        Sin becomes unpardonable only because the sinner refuses pardon.
     With every knock on the heart's door, unheeded, the inclination to open
     the door becomes weaker. The impressions of the Holy Spirit, disregarded,
     will not be as easily distinguished the next time. The heart becomes less
     and less impressionable.
        Finally, God must say, "He is joined to his idols; let him go." But His
     heart of love cries, "Oh, how can I give him up! How can I let him go!"
     (See Hosea 4:17; 11:8.)

     PERSONAL APPLICATION:
        • What kind of seed am I sowing from day to day? Will I be happy to
     reap the harvest?
        • Are my eyes "in the ends of the earth" (Prov. 17:24) like those of a
     fool, or have I set wisdom before me?
        • Is the judgment a frightful prospect to me? Or is judgment the happy
     prospect of vindication by Christ's grace?

     FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: On the retribution given to
ua   the wicked see: Prov. 6:12-15; 11:31; 29:1.
        "This standard [harmony with God, perfect righteousness] is not one to
     which we cannot attain. In every command or injunction that God gives
     there is a promise, the most positive, underlying the command. God has
     made provision that we may become like unto Him, and He will accom-
     plish this for all who do not interpose a perverse will and thus frustrate His
     grace."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 76.

     SUMMARY: While God is the Designer of the laws that govern all mat-
     ter, energy, and life, He is not responsible for the harvest I reap. I sow the
     seed of my choice; I am the arbiter of my own destiny. If I opt to be a fool,
     I will not be condemned for my weakness, but for refusing the help that is
     available. Or I can choose to live in harmony with the laws of life, and
     receive the necessary power from God to choose the harvest unto eternal
     life.

        Live Within Your Means

SAB      MANAGERS OF THE LORD'S GOODS. How we handle our
 PM   money and the way we live are closely related; similar principles govern
      both. In fact, "stewardship" is not merely a matter of finances; it relates
      also to the whole scope of life—time, talent, energy, and influence.
         Undergirding and enabling the true stewardship of life is the understand-
      ing that "the earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof; the world, and they
      that dwell therein" (Ps. 24:1). We are not owners, but managers of the
      Lord's goods. As Christians, we have accepted the responsibility of acting in
      the Master's stead, doing as He would do were He presiding directly over
      His own goods. As stewards, then, we should be interested to hear the coun-
      sel of the Owner, to learn what are His priorities, what methods bring most
      permanent benefit, and how best to represent Him in all our dealings.

      MEMORY TEXT: "Honor the Lord with thy substance, and with the
      firstfruits of all thine increase: So shall thy barns be filled with plenty,
      and thy presses shall burst out with new wine" (Proverbs 3:9, 10).

      THEME: When our business enterprises and the management of our per-
      sonal affairs are governed by the principles of the Word of God, we have
      the approval and blessing of the Lord.

1. What is one way we can honor the Lord? Prov. 3:9. What results
   does God promise? Prov. 3:10; 10:3 (compare Mal. 3:10, 11).


   "[God's] glory must be the motive of all who are laborers together with
Him. All our work is to be done from love to God and in accordance with
His
   "But God will not accept the greatest talents or the most splendid service
unless self is laid upon the altar."—Christ' s Object Lessons, p. 350.
   Many and varied are the blessings that God pours out upon those who
honor and trust Him. Sometimes He gives temporal prosperity; sometimes,
for reasons that we do not understand, He withholds it. He always bestows
upon His faithful children protection from the forces of evil and offers
assurance of eternal life.
    Knowing "them that are his" (2 Tim. 2:19), God allows the devil to
tempt His children in order to demonstrate to both sides of the onlooking
universe the genuineness of their trust.
   If you have little or nothing of this world's goods, how can you
follow the instruction to "honour the Lord with thy substance" (Prov.
3:9)?
11. LOVE OF MONEY (Prov. 11:28).

2. In what sense is the love of money "the root of all evil" (1 Tim.
   6:10)? Prov. 28:20, 22.


   Not money itself, but the love of money is the root of all evil. The
material status of an individual does not necessarily indicate the direction
of his affections. A poor man can love money as dearly as a rich man—
perhaps even more so. The danger lies in misplaced priorities, often lead-
ing to unscrupulous means of acquiring more money.
   What kinds of activity in your life demonstrate the love of money?

3. What principle, applied to business, shields a person from "mak-
   ing haste to be rich"? Prov. 13:11, 12, 19.


   It is rarely easy to be patient! It is not fun to wait for the fulfillment of
one's dreams. But far better to make progress slowly than to damage one's
character by sinful, hasty acquisition.
   "It is abomination to fools to depart from evil" (Prov. 13:19). "The
very idea that he [the fool] should behave in any other way is unthinkable
to him, quite abhorrent in fact (13:19); for he thinks it would spoil his fun
(10:23) and make life very drab (15:21)."—Kenneth T. Aitken, Proverbs
(Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1986), p. 100.

       Live Within Your Means                                    November 9
      4. What is the ultimate end of him who trusts in riches? Prov. 11:28
         (compare 23:4, 5; 27:20).



         Jesus' teaching. To many of Jesus' hearers, the present life was all that
      existed, and providing for its temporal needs was all that mattered. As
      something strange and new, the words of Jesus fell on the ears of the
      wondering multitude. (See Matt. 6:24-34.) He taught that even as this earth
      offers no permanent safety for material possessions, so it can provide no
      eternal refuge for the soul. Our hearts will be where our treasure is. In view
      of this fact, Jesus recommended we store up our treasure in heaven, seek
      first God's kingdom, and not be anxious about our needs.

        In your view, why does the Lord allow some people to be more
      wealthy than others? What is the responsibility of the rich believer in
      Christ to his poorer brothers and sisters? Should he give them all his
      money? What is the responsibility of the poor believer to the rich?
      Should he regard himself as inferior?

MON   I11. GENEROSITY AND CONTENTMENT (Prov. 11:24, 25).

      5. Why is it important to share? Prov. 11:24, 25 (compare 22:9;
         28:27).



        The New International Version translates Proverbs 11:24, 25: "One
      man gives freely, yet gains even more; another withholds unduly, but
      comes to poverty. A generous man will prosper; he who refreshes others
      will. himself be refreshed."

         Oppression of others is self-defeating. "He who oppresses the poor to
      increase his wealth and he who gives gifts to the rich—both come to
      poverty" (Prov. 22:16, NIV). Jesus taught that we should not favor the
      rich for the sake of social acceptance. We have a responsibility to minister
      to the poor. (See Luke 14:12-14.)

         What does it mean to be a Christian? "It is to be Christlike, to do
      others good, to be divested of all selfishness, and to have our lives marked
      with acts of disinterested benevolence [free from self-interest]. Our Re-
      deemer throws souls into the arms of the church, for them to care for
      unselfishly and train for heaven, and thus be co-workers with Him. But the
      church too often thrusts them away, upon the devil's battlefield. . . . Can-
      not God return into their granaries and increase their flocks, so that instead
      of loss there shall be increase?"—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 331.

      6. What else besides tangible, material goods can we share? Prov.
         25:25; 31:9.


                                                                                  43
  Lesson 6                                                 November 9
   Be generous and giving with what you have—even if it is only good
news, or a smile and a greeting! Try to understand the inner need of the
individual; look beneath the surface. Ask for divine help that you may
strengthen and cheer and help the needy one to the best of your ability
and according to his or her need. Help others help themselves if
possible. William Booth offered "soup, soap, and salvation," in that
order.
   Plead the cause of the needy to those who may be better able to assist.
And above all, deal with them in such a manner as to represent the Father
in heaven: with genuine caring, mercy, and justice.
7. How can a person be contented even though obliged to live in
   poverty? Prov. 28:6 (compare 15:16; 16:8; Heb. 13:5).


   It was generally believed among the Jews of Jesus' time that sin is
punished in this life and that any calamity, financial or physical, was the
penalty for wrongdoing, either of the sufferer himself or of his parents.
(See John 9:1-4.) Thus such a one had the added burden of guilt, of being
regarded as a great sinner and under the curse of God.
   Conversely, wealth, by whatever means it was acquired, appeared to be
the manifest blessing of God and, as such, wielded extraordinary influence.
Hence the question of the disciples, "Who then can be saved?" in re-
sponse to Jesus' statement that it is easier for a camel to pass through the
eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God. (See Matt.
19:24, 25.)

   The best things of life are free! It is better to want what you have, and
not want what you do not have, than turn it the other way around. The most
important things of life—truth, love, happiness, a close fellowship with
God—are not dependent on monetary possessions.
   A grateful, positive attitude, whatever the circumstances of our lives, is
a source of health and happiness. (See Prov. 15:15; 30:7-9.) Gratitude and
love transform the humblest meal into a feast, the poorest home into a
palace.

  Can you testify to the manifold blessings of the Lord in times when
you have been poor? Can you testify to the joy you experienced as you
gave to someone more needy than yourself?

IV. WORK AND PLAN AHEAD (Prov. 14:15; 22:3).
8. What is the source of lasting profit? Prov. 14:23; 13:11.



   "What human power can do divine power is not summoned to do. God
does not dispense with man's aid. He strengthens him, cooperating with
him as he uses the powers and capabilities given him."—The Desire of
Ages, p. 535.

       Live Within Your Means                                   November 9
       9. What basic principle is depicted in Proverbs 27:18? (Compare
          James 5:4.)



         "Every laborer is to receive his or her just due. It may be thought to be
      a good plan to allow persons to give talent and earnest labor to the work of
      God, while they draw nothing from the treasury. But this is making a
      difference, and selfishly withholding from such workers their due. God
      will not put His sanction on any such plan."—Evangelism, p. 491.

WED   10. How does a wise person relate to the future? Prov. 14:15; 22:3.



         The Revised Standard Version translates Proverbs 14:15: "The simple
      believes everything, but the prudent looks where he is going."
         There is wisdom in planning for the future. To put aside savings to take
      care of future expenses is not contrary to God's will. Insofar as this is
      possible, it is the prudent thing to do.
         The counsel given to one person applies, in principle, to each of us:
      "Every week you should lay by in some secure place five or ten dollars
      not to be used up unless in case of sickness. With economy you may place
      something at interest. With wise management you can save something
      after paying your debts."—Selected Messages, book 2, p. 329.
         We are not assured there will be a tomorrow for us. (See Prov. 27:1, 23,
      24.) Today is the day to do our best and endeavor to follow the will of
      God. There will be no further opportunity in the grave to which we are
      going, we know not when.

      11. What warnings are we given about wrong methods of earning
          money? Prov. 28:8.



         Usury is lending money at interest. Today it sometimes refers to lending
      at a rate of interest that is excessive or unlawfully high.

         The practice in Israel. "Contrary to modem practice, God's people
      were forbidden to collect interest (KJV 'usury') on a loan to a poor
      Israelite (Ex 22:25), but this prohibition was not always heeded (Jer 15:10;
      Eze 18:13). Collection of interest was permitted when the loan was to a
      foreigner (Deut 23:20)."—SDA Bible Dictionary, article, "Loan."
         "The Israelites lived in a simple state of society, and hence they were
      encouraged to lend to each other in a friendly way, without any hope of
      gain. But the case was different with foreigners, who, engaged in trade and
      commerce, borrowed to enlarge their capital, and might reasonably be
      expected to pay interest on their loans. Besides, the distinction was ad-
      mirably conducive to keeping the Israelites separate from the rest of the
      world."—Robert Jamieson, A. R. Fausset, David Brown, Commentary on
      the Whole Bible (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan, n.d.), p. 136.
                                                                                45
  Lesson 6                                                 November 9
   How can we apply God's counsel to Israel regarding usury to our
financial practices today?

   "Am I my brother's keeper?" Speaking of Sabbath keepers in 1865,
Ellen White wrote that God was displeased with them for their avaricious
spirit. Their desire to acquire wealth was so strong that they took "advan-
tage of poor, unfortunate brethren in their distress and have added to their
own already abundant means, while these poorer brethren have suffered
for the same means. 'Am I my brother's keeper?' is the language of their
hearts."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 535.

12. What is the meaning of Proverbs 20:25? What warning are we
    given regarding not keeping our vows to God? Prov. 20:25 (com-
    pare Deut. 23:21, 22; Eccl. 5:5).



  The New International Version translates Prov. 20:25: "It is a trap for a
man to dedicate something rashly and only later to consider his vows."

   Don't use the Lord's money for secular purposes. "It is no better
than sacrilege for a man to take from God's treasury in order to serve
himself or to serve others in their secular business. . . . Let no one, when
brought into a strait place, take money consecrated to religious purposes,
and use it for his advantage, soothing his conscience by saying that he will
repay it at some future time. Far better to cut down the expenses to cone-
spond with the income, to restrict the wants, and live within the means,
than to use the Lord's money for secular purposes."—Counsels on
Stewardship, p. 79.

V. DEBT AND "SURETY" (Prov. 22:7; 6:1-5).

13. Why do you think "the borrower is servant to the lender" (Prov.
    22:7)?



   Debt is a trap, attractive, subtle, and destructive. In a letter written in
1877, Ellen White counseled an individual, "Be determined never to incur
another debt. Deny yourself a thousand things rather than run in debt. . . .
Avoid it as you would the smallpox."—Counsels on Stewardship, p. 257.
This is a call for us to live within our means!

14. What counsel does the wise man give regarding the risk involved
    in acceptance of legal responsibility for someone else's debt?
    Prov. 6:1-5 (compare 11:15; 17:18).



   A surety is someone who has become legally liable for another person's
debt, responsible for guaranteed payment even if he must take it out of his
46
 Live Within Your Means                                 November 9
own pocket. This can become a dangerous snare, especially in the case of
guaranteeing payment on behalf of a stranger. While we are to "bear one
another's burdens," the Lord does not expect us to be responsible for
someone else's folly.

INDICATE WHETHER EACH OF THE FOLLOWING STATE-
MENTS IS TRUE (T) OR FALSE (F):

         My money and all my possessions are my own to be used as I
         see fit.
        Money is only as valuable as it is useful for good purposes.
        The security of treasure on earth is no valid indicator of where
         one's priorities should be placed.
        To share what I have with someone in need will not necessari-
         ly deplete my own resources.
        Work was designed by God to be a blessing to humanity.
        Planning ahead is equal to "boasting thyself of tomorrow."
        Debt is sometimes necessary and justifiable.
FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Compare with the teaching
of Proverbs the following passages from the New Testament: 2 Cor. 8:9;
Gal. 2:10; 2 Thess. 3:10; 1 Tim. 6:9, 17, 18; James 2:1-6; Rev. 2:9; 3:17.

SUMMARY: God is not only owner of all, but also is our wise and loving
Father. He wants us to prosper and enjoy good health. We honor Him, as
well as protect our own interests when, as wise stewards of our resources,
we follow His directions.

      November 10-16



       As the Needle to the Pole
SAB       INTEGRITY IS A MATTER OF THE HEART. The book of Pro-
 PM   verbs speaks of those who reverence the Lord as righteous. Because such
      people have entered into covenant fellowship with Him, God has bestowed
      His righteousness upon them. The person who fears (reverences) the Lord
      has true knowledge, wisdom, and righteousness (Prov. 2:1-9). Hence,
      when we read such statements as "The righteousness of the perfect shall
      direct his way. . . . The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them"
      (Prov. 11:5, 6), we should not conclude that we are saved by our own
      independent righteousness. That would be righteousness by works. God is
      telling us that His righteousness, made our own, will deliver us and direct
      our way. (Compare Isa. 64:6; Jer. 33:16; Phil. 3:9.)
          Those who receive the righteousness of God by faith possess the
      characteristics of righteousness; they are merciful, just, and honest. It is
      possible to be an outwardly nice person without the power of Christ, but
      only He can give us hearts that are humble, gentle, and courteous.
          "The greatest want of the world is the want of men—men who will
      not be bought or sold, men who in their inmost souls are true and
      honest, men who do not fear to call sin by its right name, men whose
      conscience is as true to duty as the needle to the pole, men who will
      stand for the right though the heavens fall."—Education, p. 57 (italics
      supplied).

      MEMORY TEXT: "The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but
      the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them" (Proverbs 11:3).

I. THE KING—THE MODEL FOR HIS PEOPLE (Prov. 29:2).

   In Bible times, both in Israel and other nations, kings were supreme
judges. The author of most of the proverbs was a king whose wise judgments
were recorded for future generations. But Solomon was not always wise.
Tragically he wandered away from God's ideal of just and faithful kingship.
   The practices of the king usually became those of his people. He either
set a pattern of purity, truth, justice, and honesty, or he led his people down
the path of disloyalty to God, to impurity, idolatry, injustice, and dishon-
esty.

1. In what kind of king do his subjects rejoice? Prov. 29:2.



   Of course, none of us are kings. But each of us can appreciate a just
ruler. Moreover, each of us is given some responsibility, some important
trust for which we are accountable to the Master. In the advice given for
long-ago rulers, we will discover valuable gems that can enable us to deal
fairly with those whose lives we touch.

   Servant or lord? "Christ was establishing a kingdom on different
principles. He called men, not to authority, but to service, the strong to
bear the infirmities of the weak. Power, position, talent, education, placed
their possessor under greater obligation to serve his fellows."—The Desire
of Ages, p. 550.

2. By what is the king preserved? Prov. 20:28.



   The characteristics mentioned in Proverbs 20:28 are the characteristics
of God. (See Ps. 85:9, 10.) The delightful paradox is that God is both
perfectly just and perfectly merciful. He is so just that He cannot save for
eternity a sinner who refuses to accept His atonement for sin. He is so
merciful that He can completely forgive and restore to Himself the one
who accepts the atonement provided by His Son. (See John 3:16, 36.)

   Judgment and mercy. "It is the mingling of judgment and mercy that
makes salvation full and complete. It is the blending of the two that leads
us, as we view the world's Redeemer and the law of Jehovah, to exclaim,
`Thy gentleness hath made me great.' "—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1072.

3. List what a good king should do:

   Prov. 20:8, 26

    Prov. 25:2, 4, 5

    Prov. 29:14
                                                                             49
        Lesson 7                                                November 16
           Prov. 31:8, 9

         The characteristics of God are shared with the ruler who accepts Christ
      and chooses to serve Him. Mercy and justice are mingled in his dealings
      with his people. In His reign, Christ mingles perfect justice (Matt 3:12)
      with infinite mercy (Eph. 2:4, 5). The same characteristics are manifested
      by all who enter into fellowship with the heavenly King. Because His love
      rules supreme in their hearts they are unwilling to deny facts, but equally
      unwilling to usurp God's role of ultimate Judge. Even so, secular authori-
      ties are appointed to pass judgment on those who break the laws of the
      land. And the church as a corporate body has the duty of deciding if a
      member fails to conform to the standards governing church membership.
      (Compare Matt. 7:1-5 with 1 Cor. 5:12; 6:2, 3; Rom. 13:1-4.)

MON   4. If a person in authority pays attention to false information, what
         will the officials who serve under that person be like? Prov. 29:12.
         Why do you think this is so?



         Do his servants become wicked or are they already wicked? "A king
      sets his own policy, but he must depend on information from advisers to
      help him formulate that policy. If he only listens to lies from advisers (like
      King Ahab who rejected the prophecy of Micaiah in 1 Kings 22), then all
      the men who surround him will cater to his depravity and become
      wicked."—Robert L. Alden, Proverbs (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Baker,
      1983), p. 201.

      5. In what ways may the following counsels given to kings and
         leaders be applied by every Christian believer?

           Prov. 16:10

           Prov. 16:12

           Prov. 18:5; 24:23-25

           Prov. 31:3-5

         Whatever your calling in life, in what practical ways would your
      effectiveness be improved by following the instruction given to kings in
      the book of Proverbs?

      11. MERCY OR REVENGE? (Prov. 11:17).

      6. Explain the result of living out in one's own life the principles of
         righteousness and mercy. Prov. 21:21; 11:17.



           We are not instructed to be merciful to others so that good will come
      50
 As the Needle to the Pole                             November 16
upon ourselves. There is nothing self-serving in the motives of the
genuinely merciful person. Mercy is a characteristic of God that becomes
ours when we enter into fellowship with Him. "Whoever does not love
does not know God, because God is love" (1 John 4:8, NIV).

    Jesus pronounced a blessing on the merciful. "Blessed are the merci-
ful: for they shall obtain mercy" (Matt. 5:7). Every seed bears fruit after
its own kind, whether in the natural world or in the spiritual kingdom.
Mercy's blessing is twofold. First, kindness reacts on the giver in im-
mediate happiness, because mercy is always a happier way to live. Then
kindness bears fruit in the words and actions of others in whose hearts the
seed was planted, returning to refresh the soul who sowed it there.

   Reflect the nature of God. "The heart of man is by nature cold and
dark and unloving; whenever one manifests a spirit of mercy and forgive-
ness, he does it not of himself, but through the influence of the divine
Spirit moving upon his heart. 'We love, because he first loved us.' 1 John
4:19, R.V. . . .
   "The merciful are 'partakers of the divine nature,' and in them the
compassionate love of God finds expression. All whose hearts are in sym-
pathy with the heart of Infinite Love will seek to reclaim and not to
condemn. Christ dwelling in the soul is a spring that never runs dry. Where
He abides, there will be an overflowing of beneficence."—Thoughts From
the Mount of Blessing, pp. 21, 22.

7. Apart from kindness shown to human beings, how else is a merci-
   ful spirit manifested? Prov. 12:10.



   The Bible teaches that the Lord's "tender mercies are over all his
works" (Ps. 145:9). This means that cruelty to animals is opposition to
God; it is sin. Those who are working to save the endangered species are
cooperating with the Lord in watching over His created works. Hunters
who kill for sport and pleasure and those who treat domestic animals
cruelly are classified in Scripture as wicked.

8. What excuse for unmerciful neglect is unacceptable to God? Prov.
   24:11, 12.



   "In the great judgment day, those who have not worked for Christ, who
have drifted along thinking of themselves, caring for themselves, will be
placed by the Judge of the whole earth with those who did evil. They
receive the same condemnation.
   "To every soul a trust is given. Of everyone the Chief Shepherd will
demand, 'Where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?'
And 'what wilt thou say when he shall punish thee?' Jeremiah 13:20,
21."—The Desire of Ages, p. 641.

                                                                         51
 Lesson 7                                                 November 16
9. What are the hazards involved in harboring a spirit of revenge
   toward those who have wronged us? Prov. 24:17-20 (compare
   26:24-28).



     Vengeful people who cherish hate toward their enemies do the greatest
harm to their own spiritual and psychological health. Christ cannot dwell
in the heart of a hateful person. The vengeance of God (Heb. 10:30, 31) is
not in any way comparable to human vindictiveness. God's perfect love
demands perfect justice for all.
    "He that loveth not his brother abideth in death" (1 John 3:14; see also
1 John 2:11). This means that the individual who is harboring a vengeful
spirit is living outside of Christ. The result is serious damage to psycholo-
gical health, and possibly also to physical health. The ultimate result is loss
of eternal life.

   How to treat an enemy. As Christ dwells in our hearts we are enabled
to practice the counsel He gives: "If thine enemy be hungry, give him
bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink: For thou shalt
heap coals of fire upon his head, and the Lord shall reward thee" (Prov.
25:21, 22; compare Matt. 5:43-48).

   As we forgive our debtors. "One of the most common sins, and one
that is attended with most pernicious results, is the indulgence of an unfor-
giving spirit. How many will cherish animosity or revenge and then bow
before God and ask to be forgiven as they forgive. Surely they can have no
true sense of the import of this prayer or they would not dare to take it
upon their lips. We are dependent upon the pardoning mercy of God every
day and every hour; how then can we cherish bitterness and malice toward
our fellow sinners!"—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 170.

   Think of a situation in your life in which you showed a merciful,
forgiving spirit toward someone who had wronged you. What was the
effect of your attitude upon: (a) the person you forgave; (b) yourself?

I11. JUSTICE OR INJUSTICE? (Prov. 21:15).

10. List some characteristics of "the just," the righteous:

     Prov. 4:18

     Prov. 9:9

     Prov. 10:20

     Prov. 20:7

  The just are the righteous who have accepted God as their King and
who, by His grace, obey His law. (See Isa. 51:1, 7; Rom. 8:9, 10; 10:6-10.)
They practice justice in their dealings with their fellow human beings
52
  As the Needle to the Pole                               November 16
because they have received the righteousness of Christ into their hearts by
the Holy Spirit. They are given the assurance of eternal life with the Lord.

   Natural antagonists. The just and the unjust cannot respect each other's
characters. (See Prov. 29:10, 27.) Yet the just express their genuine concern
for the unjust by praying and working for them. They really care.

11. How does the book of Proverbs describe the unjust (the un-
    righteous)? Prov. 11:5-7; 28:8-10 (compare 2 Pet. 2:9).



   The Lord never justifies the unjust, nor does He condemn the just. "He
that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just [righteous], even
they both are abomination to the Lord" (Prov. 17:15). The Lord gave the
same message through Moses: "I will not justify the wicked" (Ex. 23:7).

   Then what hope is there for us? We are all sinners in the sight of a
holy God. (See Rom. 3:10-19.) In the light of the Old Testament teaching,
how can we explain Paul's statement: "But to him that worketh not [does
not attempt to earn favor with God by his own efforts], but believeth on
him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness"
(Rom. 4:5, italics supplied)?

   The answer is that when Christ justifies the ungodly (the unjust) they
do not remain ungodly. The ungodly are unjustified, unconverted, outside
of Christ, and lost. (See 1 Tim. 1:9; 1 Peter 4:18; 2 Peter 3:7.) The justified
have been transformed by the power of Christ. They are now willing slaves
to righteousness (Rom. 6:17, 18); their lives are in conformity with God's
law (Rom. 8:3, 4), because the Holy Spirit is reigning in their hearts
(verses 9, 10).
   When probation closes a short time prior to the second coming of Jesus,
the just (the righteous) will remain right with God for eternity, and the
unjust (the wicked) will remain antagonistic to God. (See Rev. 22:11.) At
the Advent the just will be translated and the unjust slain by the brightness
of His coming. (See 1 Thess. 4:16-18; 2 Thess. 1:7-10.)

   If an unjust person comes to you with the plea that he or she wishes
to change sides, what steps would you recommend? How would you
explain from the Bible the means by which he can be transformed in
character?
   How does a Christian help persons who are escaping the results of
their wrong and not dealing with its root cause?

IV. HONESTY OR DECEIT? (Prov. 20:17).

12. What makes a person dishonest and deceptive? Prov. 11:18; 12:5,
    20.



                                                                            53
  Lesson 7                                              November 16
   Unless Christ reigns supreme in a human heart, the evil one will convey
his characteristics, and there will be no fortress against deception of one
form or another. Satan will deceive the soul, and that soul, in turn, will
practice deception.

13. What are some of the forms of deception practiced by those who
    do not know Christ? Prov. 17:23; 29:24; 10:10.



   Proverbs 17:23 reads in the New International Version: "A wicked man
accepts a bribe in secret to pervert the course of justice."
   True Christians faithfully pay their bills and refuse to be bribed in any
way. They categorically reject any of the many forms of stealing that are
practiced in our world today, and refuse to lie under any circumstances.
Cheating in examinations or as a means of personal advancement is totally
foreign to one who is serving Christ.

   Spiritual toughness is needed. "There is in true Christian character an
indomitableness that cannot be molded or subdued by adverse circum-
stances. We must have moral backbone, an integrity that cannot be flat-
tered, bribed, or terrified."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 498.

14. In what ways does the Lord bless those who are strictly honest?
    Prov. 10:3, 24, 25, 28-30.



HOW ARE MY DAILY DECISIONS AFFECTING MY DESTINY?
  • Am I God's friend as God considers true friendship?
   • Do I receive favors from God without acknowledging their Source?
  • Am I as ready to extend finite, human mercy as to ask for the mercy
and forgiveness of God?
  • How can I in my inmost soul be true and honest, as true to duty as the
needle to the pole?
  • Were the final decision of the judgment to be made today, where
would I find my place?

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Consider the examples of
integrity referred to in the following passages: Num. 16:15; 1 Sam. 12:4;
2 Sam. 18:12; 1 Kings 13:8; 2 Kings 5:16.

SUMMARY: Jesus is the King of kings, the Author of mercy, justice, and
honesty. He is the ultimate Example. Today He still waits to bestow His
character, His likeness on all who are willing to accept Him. He provides
the power, the means to live a life of strict integrity. Will you accept the
gift of His divine presence in your life?

SAB       THE CAPACITY TO LISTEN IS AS IMPORTANT AS THE
 PM   CAPACITY TO SPEAK. A young man asked Socrates to teach him
      oratory. Because he talked so much Socrates asked for double fees. "Why
      are you charging me double?" the young student asked. "Because I must
      teach you two sciences: the one how to hold your tongue and the other
      how to speak. The first science is the more difficult, but aim at proficiency
      at it, or you will suffer greatly and create trouble without end."
          What goes on in our minds determines the effectiveness or ineffec-
      tiveness of our speech. "For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
      speaketh" (Matt. 12:34). "The heart" refers to the mind, the source of
      thoughts, feelings, actions, and motives. Even as positive and negative
      actions stem from the mind, so do positive and negative words. The things
      we say have important consequences not only to the people around us, but
      to our own souls, as well.
      MEMORY TEXT: "A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pic-
      tures of silver" (Proverbs 25:11).

      THEME: Our words are either a source of strength and encouragement or
      of weakness and despair; they either build up or tear down. As we allow
      the power of God's Word to control our minds, our words reflect His love.

   Jesus illustrated the importance of mind-control as the basis of
speech-control. (See Matt. 12:34-37.) The tongue is an index to the heart.
The reason for the abundance of "mouth trouble" that afflicts us is the
"heart trouble" with which we were born and to which we have added by
our wrong choices.
   Jesus said that idle words are sin. In the judgment we are justified or
condemned by our words. This does not mean that we earn justification by
good words. It means that consistently good words evidence the heart
change we have experienced, and evil words evidence that the change
needs to be made.
   The only permanent remedy lies in the power of the Master Teacher,
who can transform our minds and enable us to speak pure words. One way
Jesus does this is through the medium of Christian education and Christian
teachers. "In the highest sense, the work of education and the work of
redemption are one."—Education, p. 30.

2. How would you express Proverbs 4:23 in your own words?



    How can we follow this counsel? Notice the context of Proverbs 4:23.
God's Word must be cherished (Prov. 4:20, 21). But how? "I can do
everything through him who gives me strength" (Phil. 4:13, NIV). We
choose Christ daily, feeding on His Word, storing in our minds the positive
truths and promises it contains. When we are tempted to give voice to evil
words, we ask Christ for His power, claim His victory, and praise Him for
it. By reminding ourselves of His Word and claiming it by faith, we can
speak in a manner acceptable to Heaven.

    Heavenly conversation. "In the work of heart-keeping we must be
instant in prayer, unwearied in petitioning the throne of grace for as-
sistance. Those who take the name of Christian should come to God in
earnestness and humility, pleading for help. . . .
    "He whose conversation is in heaven, is the most profitable Christian to
all around him. His words are useful and refreshing. They have a trans-
forming power upon those who hear them, and will melt and subdue the
soul."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3,
p. 1157.

   We have emphasized that what is on the inside comes through to
the outside. Is it also true that our words influence our own minds?
Can you illustrate the thought contained in the following quotation?

   " 'Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.' But the
words are more than an indication of character; they have power to react
on the character. Men are influenced by their own words. Often under a
momentary impulse, prompted by Satan, they give utterance to jealousy or
evil surmising, expressing that which they do not really believe; but the
expression reacts on the thoughts. They are deceived by their words, and
come to believe that true which was spoken at Satan's instigation."—The
Desire of Ages, p. 323.

      11. WORDS THAT DESTROY (Prov. 10:19).

         Destructive words come in a number of forms: lies, criticism, gossip,
      flattery, impetuosity, scorn, argumentativeness, and anger. All such nega-
      tive speech comes from minds that are out of harmony with Christ.

MON   3. Identify the kinds of lying mentioned in the following passages.
         What will ultimately become of liars? Refer to a modern version if
         possible.

         Prov. 14:5, 25

         Prov. 18:8

         Prov. 19:5, 9

         Prov. 20:14

         Prov. 26:18, 19

         Lying is sometimes divided into categories. Supposedly there are white
      lies and black lies; are there varying degrees of gray lies in between? Or
      are all untruths sinful?

         Any intention to mislead is falsehood. " 'Thou shalt not bear false
      witness against thy neighbor.' False speaking in any matter, every• attempt
      or purpose to deceive our neighbor, is here included. An intention to
      deceive is what constitutes falsehood. By a glance of the eye, a motion of
      the hand, an expression of the countenance, a falsehood may be told as
      effectually as by words. All intentional overstatement, every hint or in-
      sinuation calculated to convey erroneous or exaggerated impression, even
      the statement of facts in such a manner as to mislead, is falsehood. . . .
      Even the intentional suppression of truth, by which injury may result to
      others, is a violation of the ninth commandment."—Patriarchs and
      Prophets, p. 309.

      4. What does the book of Proverbs have to say about strife and gos-
         sip? Prov. 16:27, 28 (compare 26:20, 21; 11:13).



        "He who covers over [forgives, RSV] an offense promotes love, but
      whoever repeats the matter separates close friends" (Prov. 17:9, NIV).

         How does this counsel relate to the publication of literature specifi-
      cally designed to expose the faults, failings, and mistakes of those who
      are endeavoring to bear responsibilities in the church? In the light of
      the Bible counsel can you support or distribute such publications?

        The Bible indicates the correct way to confront problems. (See Matt.
      18:15-17; 1 Tim. 5:1, 17-21.) "Not until you feel that you could sacrifice
                                                                              57
  Lesson 8                                                 November 23
your own self-dignity, and even lay down your life in order to save an
erring brother, have you cast the beam out of your own eye so that you are
prepared to help your brother. Then you can approach him and touch his
heart."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pp. 128, 129.

  In what way is the Bible counsel regarding negative criticism rele-
vant within the home, the school, the local church, the place in which
you work?

   "Cease to dwell upon the shortcomings of others. Keep the tongue
sanctified unto God. Refrain from saying anything that might detract from
the influence of another; for by indulging in these words of criticism, you
blaspheme God's holy name as verily as you would were you to swear."—
Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1093.

5. Why is flattery so harmful? Prov. 26:28 (compare 27:6; 28:23;
   29:5).



   Flattery is insincere or excessive praise. A genuine expression of appre-
ciation is not flattery. Sometimes in the attempt to avoid flattery, we hurt a
person with little or no praise. The ministry of encouragement can revital-
ize the waning forces of a weary soul.

6. Why is hasty speech so damaging? What are the advantages of
   restraint and caution in the way we express ourselves? Prov. 29:20
   (compare 15:1, 28; 18:13).



  Think before you speak. "Be sure brain is engaged before putting
mouth into gear"—practical advice that can be applied!—especially so
when the brain itself is in contact with Headquarters.

   Gentleness under provocation—an effective argument. "The servants
of Christ . . . need to have close communion with God, lest, under provoca-
tion, self rise up, and they pour forth a torrent of words that are unbefitting,
that are not as dew or the still showers that refresh the withering plants. This
is what Satan wants them to do; for these are his methods. . . . But God's
servants are to be representatives of Him. . . . And the spirit that is kept
gentle under provocation will speak more effectively in favor of the truth
than will any argument, however forcible."—The Desire of Ages, p. 353.

7. What do the following passages teach regarding scorn and anger?

     Prov. 15:18

     Prov. 16:32

     Prov. 22:10

         How delightfully practical the Bible is! It identifies the kinds of
      speech that cause sorrow, antagonism, and misery: lying, criticism,
      gossip, flattery, and hasty, scornful, angry words. Assuming that at
      least sometimes you are guilty of one or more of these modes of speech,
      what steps do you take to overcome? What counsel from your per-
      sonal experience would you share with someone struggling with the
      habit of speaking unwisely?

WED   I11. WORDS THAT INSPIRE (Prov. 10:11).

         One way to describe something is to tell what it is not. But that is not
      the only way the writers of the proverbs give instruction regarding proper
      speech. They tell us what good speech is and the effect it has.

      8. How does the book of Proverbs characterize the speech of a righ-
         teous person?

         Prov. 10:11

         Prov. 10:13, 31

         Prov. 10:21

         Prov. 10:32

         The manner in which Jesus spoke is the best example of the effective-
      ness of righteous words. Even the hardened hearts of the temple guards
      were melted, for they testified: "No one ever spoke the way this man
      does" (John 7:46, NIV). The reaction of the two disciples who walked
      with Him to Emmaus was the reaction of people throughout His life and
      ministry: "Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the
      way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?" (Luke 24:32).
         Jesus' words were wise, uplifting, encouraging, knowledgeable, and
      cautious. Even when He issued a rebuke, it was in a spirit of love, with the
      intention of saving the offending person. He understood the force of simple
      eloquence, and the power of silence. (See The Desire of Ages, p. 353.)

      9. What is one of the most effective ways to lift another's burdens?
         Prov. 12:25; 15:23 (compare 15:26, 30; 16:24; 17:22).



         Both the listener and the speaker are inspired by positive, encouraging
      words. Anger, discontent, selfishness, and impurity are ruinous in effect,
      while there is marvelous life-giving power to be found in cheerfulness, cour-
      age, faith, hope, and love. Before speaking we should always ponder what it
      would be like to be in the listener's shoes and the effect our words may have.

         Someone has said that "cold words freeze people, and hot words scorch
      them, and bitter words make them bitter, and wrathful words make them
      wrathful. Kind words also produce their image on men's souls; and a
                                                                                 59
       Lesson 8                                               November 23
     beautiful image it is. They soothe, and quiet, and comfort the hearer."

111 10. What is the relationship between words of wisdom and knowl-
        edge? Prov. 15:2, 7 (compare 16:21, 23).



        Our world tends to extol the virtues of knowledge. Those whose minds
     are capable of storing a multitude of facts are thought to be especially
     intelligent. Notice, however, that Solomon presents the essence of true
     education. Knowledge without wisdom ultimately is not worth much. The
     wise person knows how to interpret and apply available knowledge.
     Knowledge has value when it is wisely used for the uplifting of humanity.
     The wise person's words of knowledge involve summarizing, interpreting,
     and applying truth.

     11. Why is there special power in silence? Prov. 11:12 (compare
         13:3; 17:27, 28; 21:23).



         Sometimes we feel that we will be thought fools if we do not speak up.
     Proverbs 17:28 answers that. On the other hand, as someone has said, "It
     is better to be silent and be thought a fool than to speak up and remove all
     doubt."
        The principal contributor to these lessons testifies: "I grew up in a
     family of four daughters. And we thoroughly enjoyed talking! When we
     had too much to say, Daddy often asked us to be quiet. More than once he
     offered this bit of wisdom: 'You just watch people who are always talking:
     they don't have time to think about what they're saying, so most of it is not
     worth listening 10.' "

       The crucial question. Does my heart instruct my mouth? Is the
     wisdom that God has made available evident in my speech?

     IV. GOD'S WORDS (Prov. 30:5).

       "Man's words, if of any value, echo the words of God."—Counsels to
     Parents, Teachers, and Students, p. 423.

     12. How does Proverbs 30:5 describe the words of God?



        Pure means "refined." God's words are as pure gold and silver, free
     from all dross. Any tampering by man would not improve them; nothing
     added would increase their value. (See verse 6.)
        Christ "is a perfect and holy example, given for us to imitate. We
     cannot equal the pattern; but we shall not be approved of God if we do not
     copy it and, according to the ability which God has given, resemble it."—
     Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 549.

 Apples of Gold                                         November 23
13. What results from relying on the Lord for words that will echo
    His character? Prov. 16:1; 25:11 (compare Rev. 14:5).



   Apples of gold! "Words fitly spoken, coming from sanctified hearts
and lips, and sustained by a godly, consistent Christian deportment, will be
as apples of gold in pictures of silver."—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 247.
   Guile (deceit) will not be found in the mouth of a true Christian, for he
has consecrated his tongue—and his whole life—to the accurate repre-
sentation of his God. And God has accepted his offering, working in him
to will and to do according to His pleasure.

AM I SATISFIED WITH MY SPEECH?
   • Do my words and manner of speaking truly represent God to those
around me?
   • To what extent do I need spiritual speech therapy? What are the areas
of speech in which I can improve?
   • What Bible promises can I claim for divine assistance?

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: In answer to the question
immediately above study the following passages: 2 Cor. 9:8; Phil. 4:13;
1 Tim. 1:12; 1 John 5:2-5; Rev. 12:11. Read from the chapter titled "Who
Are My Brethren?" in The Desire of Ages, p. 323, and "Facing Life's
Record" in The Great Controversy, pp. 486, 487.

SUMMARY: The capacity to speak is a divinely bestowed talent, which,
if used rightly, can bring great blessing to those with whom we associate.
Our words are to uplift and save. Death and life are in the power of our
words, and it rests with us to choose which we will speak.

                        Wrought!"

       SCIENCE. A study of either sheds light on the other, and ultimately
       advances our knowledge of the Creator Himself.
          "In their original perfection all created things were an expression of the
       thought of God. To Adam and Eve in their Eden home nature was full of
       the knowledge of God, teeming with divine instruction. Wisdom spoke to
       the eye and was received into the heart; for they communed with God in
       His created works. As soon as the holy pair transgressed the law of the
       Most High, the brightness from the face of God departed from the face of
       nature. The earth is now marred and defiled by sin. Yet even in its blighted
       state much that is beautiful remains. God's object lessons are not oblit-
       erated; rightly understood, nature speaks of her Creator."—Chrise s Object
       Lessons, p. 18.

       MEMORY TEXT: "Speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and
       the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. Who knoweth not in all
       these that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this?" (Job 12:8, 9).

       THEME: Observation of the natural world opens a treasury of information
       to the keen searcher for truth: practical, scientific, and spiritual.

          By connecting truth with familiar objects we are reminded afresh, with
       every sight of them, of the teaching of Scripture and the impressions of the
       Holy Spirit. This, incidentally, is one practical method of keeping our
       hearts "in tune" with heaven.

1. Of whom does Job advise us to inquire for information concerning
   God? Job 12:7-9.



   So much can be learned from animals. If we only understood all about
them, we would have a clearer conception of God and His care for His crea-
tures. How can a bear hibernate five months and not atrophy? What shuts off
the growth of a hibernator and tells the body to put on weight instead, even
when it is not a full-grown animal? How can young songbirds migrate
hundreds of miles to wintering areas they have never seen, after the parent
birds have gone ahead? How can lizards regenerate a tail after having
dropped the original one; or how can a starfish not only grow a new arm to
replace one lost from the original body, but regenerate a whole new body on
a severed arm if it includes a nerve from the main trunk?
   Currently, a group of scientists is studying the social behavior of
wolves. From observing how wolves usually settle their differences short
of bloodshed, they are hoping to learn how to diffuse human anger and
avert national crises.

2. What are the characteristics of the coney? Prov. 30:24, 26?



   We can learn from the coney. "There is general agreement now that
the animal intended must have been the hyrax."—The Bible Almanac
(Nashville: Thomas Nelson, 1980). The hyrax is a furry creature about the
size of the hare. Its remarkable features include its feet and toes, four toes
on its front feet and three on its hind feet. The toes are connected with skin
folds, and the soles of the feet are equipped with pads kept moist by
glands. The feet thus form natural suction cups which enable the coney to
climb the steepest and most slippery rocks.
   Coneys live in colonies in mountainous areas. They are still found in
Palestine, in the rocky Dead Sea area. They post guards who, when danger
approaches, sound an alarm by issuing sharp whistles. Then all scurry for
cover in the crannies of the rocks. (Based on Encyclopedia of Bible
Creatures [Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1965], pp. 63, 64. See Ps. 104:18.)

  Christians may cling to Christ, the solid Rock, for protection from
every enemy attack. The psalmist expressed his complete dependence
upon the Lord: "Turn your ear to me, come quickly to my rescue; be
my rock of refuge, a strong fortress to save me. Since you are my rock
and my fortress, for the sake of your name lead and guide me" (Ps.
31:2, 3, NIV).

3. With what other animals was the writer of Proverbs 30 especially
   impressed? What did he particularly like about them? Prov.
   30:29-31.



                                                                           63
        Lesson 9                                                November 30
         "Let us not forget to imitate the features of the stately ones here por-
      trayed; to be fearless as the lion, when pursuing the path of duty, not
      retreating from anything, to be useful as the male goat, as we lead a band
      of God's people; and to maintain our proper authority, as the king does, in
      any place of trust, as parents or guardians of families."—Charles Bridges,
      The Book of Proverbs, p. 726.

      4. What lesson does Solomon draw from the ant's habits? Prov. 6:6-
         11 (compare 30:24, 25).



         A sluggard is a person who is indolent, slothful, idle, or lazy. God is a
      very active being. His desire is for us to be active, providing for ourselves,
      our families, other human beings, and even for His animal creation. We are
      admonished to minister to those in need of help. The apostle Paul taught
      the Galatians: "Help to carry one another's burdens and in this way you
      will obey the law of Christ" (Gal. 6:2, TEV).

MON       Diligence, perseverance, and preparation for the future. "The habi-
      tations which the ants build for themselves show skill and perseverance.
      Only one little grain at a time can they handle, but by diligence and
      perseverance they accomplish wonders. Solomon presents to the world the
      industry of the ant as a reproach to those who waste their hours in sinful
      idleness, in practices which corrupt soul and body. The ant prepares for
      future seasons. This is a lesson which many gifted with reasoning powers
      disregard. They fail entirely to prepare for the future immortal life which
      God has in His providence secured for the fallen race."—Ellen G. White
      Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, pp. 1157, 1158.

      5. What seemingly opposite lesson is presented in the Sermon on the
         Mount, and from which creature is it drawn? Matt. 6:25, 26.



         "Relax! Eat, drink, and be merry for God will provide!" Not so! The
      desired response is trust, not irresponsibility or extravagance. The Father in
      heaven provides for the birds, but He does not drop food into their mouths
      or build their nests for them. They must gather food, build nests, and raise
      their young. Every moment they are in danger; the possibility of destruc-
      tion by enemy forces is very real on every side. Yet how cheerily they go
      about their work! How full of joy are their songs! Creatures of hill, wood,
      and field are members of God's great household, and it is from His hand
      that the desire of each is satisfied. (See Ps. 145:16.)

         "An enemy hath done this." While it is true that God feeds and cares
      for the creatures of His hand, there are also laws operating in opposition to
      the principles of His kingdom. It was not God's design that one species
      should subsist by preying upon another, nor did He originate the principle
      that only the fittest survive. Such perversions of God's original plan for life
      on this planet were caused by the enemy, the evil usurper.

     6. How did Jesus illustrate from nature His teaching regarding trust
        in God? Matt. 6:25-34.



        Why else would God have "clothed the grass" in such magnificent
     array, from brilliant jewel tones and delicate pastels to glistening, almost
     iridescent white—and all fashioned in exquisite, intricate detail—unless
     He did it for sheer enjoyment? For God is the Master Artist, a lover of
     beauty. Within His children He has planted a like appreciation, and has
     even given us a power akin to His own—individuality, creativity, inven-
     tiveness, apportioned in varying degrees. Because God is able to clothe
     nature and human personality with such beauty, why should we doubt His
     willingness to supply our daily needs?

        Are you so involved in the affairs of your busy life that you do not
     take time to enjoy the natural beauty of the world around you? Are
     there other lessons from nature you have found helpful?


la   11. LESSONS FROM PHYSICAL SCIENCE (Prov. 3:19, 20; Ps.
         19:1-6).

     7. How are God's wisdom and power manifested? Prov. 3:19, 20.



        Verse 19 speaks of the creation of the heavens and the earth. Verse 20
     indicates how God maintains His marvelous creation. He acted in the
     beginning; He continues to act day by day, moment by moment. Every day
     and night God is at work in the natural world. He keeps the earth moving,
     spinning on its axis, rotating in its orbit around the sun, not only keeping
     time, but governing time, days, seasons, and years.
        Despite its great weight, water is drawn up from the seas into the clouds
     and drips again as dew or rain to dress the earth in green vegetation. The
     grand cycle is constantly repeated. In His control over the processes of
     nature, God employs engineering marvels far beyond the ingenuity and
     power of man.

     8. What do the heavens declare about God, according to Psalm 19:1-
        6? Compare Isa. 40:26.



        The vastness, beauty, and clockwork order of the starry heavens reveal
     something of the character of God. His power is infinite, He is the author
     of matchless beauty, and He insists upon order and design. It takes greater
     faith to believe that galaxies of stars evolved on their own than it does to
     believe the Bible account that God created them. (See Rom. 1:20.)
        The universe, functioning in accordance with strict laws and mathemati-
     cal precision, did not stumble into existence as the result of nature's acci-
     dents. "Lift your eyes and look to the heavens: Who created all these? He
                                                                               65
       Lesson 9                                              November 30
      who brings out the starry host one by one, and calls them each by name.
      Because of his great power and mighty strength, not one of them is
      missing" (Isa. 40:26, NIV).

       9. How else does God reveal the glory of His character? 2 Cor. 4:4,
          6; Col. 1:25-27.



         In Old Testament times, God spoke to mankind "in various ways, but
      in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir
      of all things, and through whom he made the universe. The Son is the
      radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of his being, sustain-
      ing all things by his powerful word" (Heb. 1:1-3, NIV).
         Jesus Christ is the Creator and Sustainer of the physical universe. To
      know Him is to know the Father (John 14:9). The glory of the character of
      God is imparted to us as we enter into fellowship with Jesus. He prayed:
      "The glory which thou gayest me I have given them, that they may be one,
      even as we are one" (John 17:22).

         Unbelievers can see the character of God to some extent in the
      physical universe and to some extent in the lives of Christians. As you
      associate with those who do not believe in Jesus, in what specific ways
      do you reflect His character? By what attitudes, words, and actions do
      you attempt to make Christ known to others?

WED   HI. GOD'S CREATIVE MASTERPIECE (Ps. 8:3-5; Prov. 8:22-31).

      10. While observing the brilliance of the night sky, what important
          question did David ask the Lord? Ps. 8:3-6.



         David's question has been asked by many others after observing the
      marvels of the heavens. We seem to be infinitesimal specks on a tiny world
      in one small solar system of infinite space.
         A Jewish rabbi once offered a possible explanation for the wearing of
      the yarmulka, the little cap worn at Passover. He said, "The yarmulka is
      like the palm of the hand of God resting in blessing on the man in the
      home saying, 'Little man, you're not such big stuff!' "—Ronald B. Allen,
      The Majesty of Man (Portland, Ore.: Multnomah Press, 1984), p. 70.

        Why should God, who is greater than His universe, notice us at all?
      The answer is in Psalm 8, and it is startling:

         1. God is mindful about you and me, though we may seem small,
      even to ourselves. He notices and cares. 2. God has made us; that alone
      demonstrates His concern. We belong to Him. 3. He made man a little
      lower than Elohim. This is the original word in the Hebrew text. It
      means that God made man a little lower than Himself. 4. God crowned
      him with glory and honor. That is breathtaking; the person of man was,
      66
 "What Hath God Wrought!"                               November 30
and is to be, the revelation of God's glory and honor! 5. God visits him.
He did, above all, in the Person of His Son. He still does today. He will
do so face to face.

11. How does David, in another psalm, describe his remarkable
    origin? Ps. 139:14.



   The psalmist speaks of his conception in his mother's womb. It is a
miracle of God that is repeated in the birth of every newborn child. Ellen
White urges all to study physiology, the science of the functions of the
human body, for in it students will see that they are indeed "fearfully and
wonderfully made." (See Education, p. 201.) She speaks of mankind as
"the crowning work of His [God's] creative power."—Steps to Christ,
p. 44.

   The creation of man is the most wonderful of all miracles in God's
creative work. The design and function of every system of the human
body are wonders of supernatural wisdom and power.
   Quadrillions of cells make up the human body; several billion wear out
and are replaced every day. The heart pumps about three gallons per
minute, millions of gallons of blood in an average lifetime.
   Most intricate is the human brain, serving as the nerve center of all
physical functions, while originating thought and the power of reason. It
enables us to think God's thoughts after Him.
   The wonder of human physiology leads us to exclaim, "What hath God
wrought!" (Num. 23:23; "see what God has done!" NIV).

12. In a graphic word picture of earth's creation, what clue is given
    in Proverbs of the Creator's purpose and motivation? Prov. 8:22-
    31.



  Wisdom is the subject of this chapter. (See Prov. 8:12.) We dis-
covered in an earlier lesson that the wisdom of Proverbs is the wisdom of
God. It is preeminently the quality or characteristic of the only wise, all-
wise God. He is the source of all true wisdom.

   Wisdom is Christ the Creator. Proverbs 8 was written by Solomon.
(See Prophets and Kings, pp. 33, 34.) In the central passage of the
chapter, Solomon tells of the wisdom of God in creating the world. In
the New Testament we learn that Christ is "the wisdom of God"
(1 Cor. 1:24), and six texts declare that the world was created by Him.
(See John 1:1-3, 10; 1 Cor. 8:6; Eph. 3:9; Col. 1:16, 17; Heb. 1:1-3.)
Proverbs 3:19 teaches that "the Lord by wisdom hath founded the
earth." Commenting on Proverbs 8:22, Ellen White writes: "The Son of
God declares concerning Himself: 'The Lord possessed me in the begin-
ning.' "—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 34.

                                                                         67
       Lesson 9                                               November 30
         Why did Christ create? "My delights were with the sons of men —
     (Prov. 8:31). Christ made the world and mankind because He delights in
     us. In love and wisdom, He created us to be His loving, loyal children.
     When humanity marred their godly image, Christ did all He could to
     restore them. "What had Christ not done to win the hearts of sinners and
     to inspire them. . . . From the times of the patriarchs He had shown how
     His 'delights were with the sons of men.' "—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 195.

        Restored by Christ, the Wisdom of God. "To restore in man the
     image of his Maker, to bring him back to the perfection in which he was
     created, to promote the development of body, mind, and soul, that the
     divine purpose in His creation might be realized—this was to be the work
     of redemption. This is the object of education, the great object of life."—
     Education, pp. 15, 16.

     APPLICATION TO MY LIFE:
        • How do I respond as I am made aware of my complete dependence
     on God for my life now and in the future?
        • How do the truths of this lesson affect my relationship with Jesus?
        • What in my life can be detrimental to perfect fellowship with Him?

     FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Study what 1 Corinthians 2
ua   says about Christ as the wisdom of God imparted to believers.
        "The book of nature is a great lesson book, which in connection with
     the Scriptures we are to use in teaching others of His character, and guid-
     ing lost sheep back to the fold of God. . . . All need the teaching to be
     derived from this source. In itself the beauty of nature leads the soul away
     from sin and worldly attractions, and toward purity, peace, and God."—
     Christ' s Object Lessons, p. 24.

     SUMMARY: The natural world, the physical universe, and the physical
     structure of mankind, direct us to Jesus Christ, the Wisdom of God, who
     created all things. He seeks to restore us to the perfect image of Himself so
     that we can have unending joy in the sin-free universe.

           Like Father, Like Child

SAB      HUMAN ANGER IS USUALLY THOROUGHLY IRRATIONAL.
 PM
      On one occasion, an important businessman entered the dining car of the
      train in which he was traveling and ordered plum pudding. The waiter
      explained that they had no plum pudding. The businessman became very
      angry. He roared at the waiter: "Don't you realize that you're talking to
      one of the most frequent customers of this railroad?"
         The steward got off at the next stop and managed to get him some plum
      pudding. The passenger looked at it disdainfully, pushed it away, and
      snorted, "Take it away! I'd rather be mad at the railroad."
           God's anger is quite different. Never is He irrational, never does He
      react in an unloving manner, and never are His attitudes toward us
      governed by selfishness. God's wrath against sin is another aspect of His
      love. If He did not hate sin and deal with the sinner, we would have reason
      to question the genuineness of His love.

      MEMORY TEXT: "A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a
      broken spirit drieth the bones" (Proverbs 17:22).

      THEME. Whereas anger, revenge, and strife destroy physical health and
      spiritual vitality, a positive, contented, optimistic attitude of mind con-
      tributes to health and spirituality. Is there any place for anger? What does
      the Bible mean when it speaks of God's anger?

      I. HAPPY, HEALTHY, HOLY (Prov. 17:22).

         Holiness, spiritual wholeness, is the basis of happiness. Happiness has
      been a major quest of mankind from time immemorial. Unfortunately most
      people have ruled out heart union with God as the source of genuine
      happiness. The book of Proverbs brings us back to the true Source.

  Lesson 10                                                 December 7
1. What well-recognized benefit is attributed to happiness? Proverbs
   17:22.



   The Hebrew word translated "merry" means "joyful," "glad." The
kind of merriment intended is not the boisterous hilarity that is sometimes
justified by reference to this Bible verse. A joyful heart is one that knows
peace, freedom from guilt and fear, and contentment with the circum-
stances of life.
   Four hundred years ago Robert Burton in his Anatomy of Melancholy
cited authorities who said, "Humor purges the blood, making the body
lively and fit for any manner of employment." The philosopher Immanuel
Kant (1724-1804), believed a hearty laugh to be "a good way to jog
internally without going outdoors."
   On the other hand, research of grieving persons has revealed a decrease
in the number of white blood cells, the "soldiers" that combat germs. The
body's defenses against disease are weakened by grief. Significantly, the
place where blood cells are manufactured is bone marrow.

2. What effect does a positive mental attitude have in times of suffer-
   ing? Prov. 18:14.



   The New International Version translates Proverbs 18:14: "A man's
spirit sustains him in sickness, but a crushed spirit who can bear?"

3. When the human spirit is at the breaking point, what can help to
   alleviate the problem? Prov. 12:25; 15:13 (compare James 5:13).



   A happy melody from a heart overflowing with joy can bring a similar
spirit to another heart. When trouble threatens our contentment, a song of
trust and thanksgiving can keep us at peace both with heaven and with
those around us. Even when we cease to hear it, a melody can hold its
place in the mind, repeating its message of cheer and strength.

4. Describe and explain the experience of the person who has a
   merry heart. Prov. 15:15.



   Contentment is determined more by the state of a person's heart than by
the value of his or her possessions. "The life is more than meat, and the
body is more than raiment" (Luke 12:23).
   "The pessimist worries so much about the past, which he cannot alter,
and the future, which he cannot know, that he does not use wisely the
present, which alone is his. This attitude of gloom colors his vision and
reacts upon others. The glad, contented heart finds a feast in a little thank-

      fully received, forgets the troubles that are behind, and looks forward with
      joy and confidence to a future under the loving care of a heavenly
      Father."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1000.

      5. Read Matt. 5:3-12, listing those who have found happiness.




         The poor in spirit recognize their emptiness and fill their souls with
      Christ; those who mourn experience genuine sorrow for sin and receive in-
      finite forgiveness and healing; the meek have emptied themselves of pride
      and love of supremacy and live a life of peace even in the midst of conflict.
         Those who hunger and thirst for righteousness are filled with all the
      fullness of God (Eph. 3:19), brought into His likeness from glory to glory
      through the power of the indwelling Holy Spirit (2 Cor. 3:18). The merci-
      ful enjoy mercy; and the pure in heart, who live as in the visible presence
      of God, discern the Creator in the works of His hand, and long to reflect
      His image.
         Peacemakers have themselves received the heavenly peace offered by
      Christ, having renounced sin and opened their hearts to His love. Even
      those who are persecuted and reviled for righteousness' sake, whose un-
      likeness to the surrounding confederacy of evil has provoked hostility, can
      be happy. God has promised, "My grace is sufficient for thee" (2 Cor.
      12:9).

MON   6. What wish is expressed in 3 John 2? Why could we reasonably
         extend it to include ourselves, as well as Gaius, to whom it was
         originally written? Ex. 15:26; Ps. 103:3, 4.



         How could you be filled with contentment, peace, and joy under the
      following circumstances?
         a. You have been laid off work and cannot find another job.
         b. Your boss, who is not sympathetic with your religious faith, en-
            joys making fun of you in front of others.
         c. Your daughter, who is about to be married, has been involved
            in a car accident.
         d. You have discovered that one of your teenage children is using
            drugs.
         (See Ps. 42:5.)

      11. ANGER, STRIFE, AND REVENGE (Prov. 16:32).

         All of us are acquainted with the intense emotions that stir the human
      heart at any slight or injustice, real or supposed—particularly if it is
      directed at ourselves. Such emotions often are vented in words—angry,
      bitter, hateful expressions.

                                                                                71
 Lesson 10                                                 December 7
7. What causes of strife are pointed out in the following verses?

     Prov. 13:10

     Prov. 17:19

     Prov. 22:10

     Prov. 26:20

     Prov. 30:33

   The last part of Proverbs 30:33 reads in the NIV: "so stirring up anger
produces strife."
   The Lord does not hate in the human sense, in a spirit of selfish vindic-
tiveness. But, because sin is completely alien to His nature, He is totally
antagonistic to it. This is why the Bible teaches that God hates lies and
discord. (See Prov. 6:16, 19.) There is no disharmony in heaven, and the
Lord seeks to bring human beings into peaceful fellowship with Himself
and with one another. "When a man's ways are pleasing to the Lord, he
makes even his enemies live at peace with him" (Prov. 16:7, NIV). Jesus
taught the danger of anger (Matt. 5:21-24), and instructed us to love our
enemies (verse 44).

8. What descriptive words does Solomon apply to the individual who
   is "soon angry"? Prov. 14:17, 29 (compare Prov. 19:19).



   When we "lose our temper" we are actually not in control of our
senses, reacting rather than acting. Having temporarily lost our mind and
thrown out the life principles we had so carefully chosen, we say and do
things we will later regret. We have become fools.

   Bad temper can become a fixed habit. Today's English Version trans-
lates Proverbs 19:19: "If someone has a hot temper, let him take the
consequences. If you get him out of trouble once, you will have to do it
again." Bad temper is a reversion to childish ways of reacting. Certain
stimuli suggest a negative mode of behavior that has become customary.
The only escape from this vicious circle is to allow God to take control of
the mind and heart. For "God will be to us everything we will let Him
be."—Our High Calling, p. 131.

9. When two people are consistently hurting one another, how can
   the cycle of action and reaction be broken? Prov. 20:22 (compare
   Prov. 20:3; 24:29).



   As long as both parties operate on the basis of the principle that "one bad
turn deserves another," the fight will continue. This is the stuff of which
72
       Like Father, Like Child                                    December 7
      family feuds are made, with human life being destroyed figuratively, as well
      as literally. If only someone would be big enough to forgive! It matters not
      so much who started the quarrel as who ends it peaceably.
         The capacity to overcome bitterness and to forgive the person who we
      think has wronged us comes from the Lord: "Wait for the Lord, and he
      will deliver you" (Prov. 20:22, NIV). Ask for, believe in, and claim the
      victory that Christ has promised. (See 1 John 5:2-5.)

      10. How deserving of honor is the person who rules his spirit? Prov.
          16:32 (compare 25:28).



         "The warfare against self is the greatest battle that was ever fought. The
      yielding of self, surrendering all to the will of God, requires a struggle; but
      the soul must submit to God before it can be renewed in holiness."—Steps
      to Christ, p. 43.

         Two kinds of anger. "It is true there is an indignation that is justifi-
      able, even in the followers of Christ. When they see that God is dishon-
      ored, and His service brought into disrepute, when they see the innocent
      oppressed, a righteous indignation stirs the soul. Such anger, born of sensi-
      tive morals, is not a sin. But those who at any supposed provocation feel at
      liberty to indulge anger and resentment are opening the heart to Satan.
      Bitterness and animosity must be banished from the soul if we would be in
      harmony with heaven."—The Desire of Ages, p. 310. (See Eph. 4:26.)

WED   11. What principle is given upon which to base our relationship with
          others? Rom. 14:13.



          Are there stumbling blocks in your path? Even they do not constitute
      a legitimate excuse for bad temper, for God knows how to deal with them.
          "If we are creatures of circumstance, we shall surely fail of perfecting
      Christian characters. You must master circumstances, and not allow cir-
      cumstances to master you. You can find energy at the cross of Christ"—
      Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 47.

        In your own experience, what good methods have you employed in
      counteracting the causes of strife and discord?

      I11. THE WRATH OF THE ALMIGHTY (Prov. 11:23).

         "If I'm not supposed to get mad, why can God?" This kind of query
      evokes more than one kind of response. A typical but shallow and inaccu-
      rate answer would be: "Well, God is ruler and master of everything, and
      He has the right to do whatever He wants. You don't question God."
         At the other extreme is: "What do you mean, God can get mad? Why,
      that is contrary to His nature! He would never hurt anything!"

                                                                                   73
 Lesson 10                                                December 7
   Both answers present problems. The first pictures our loving Father-
God as a wise, powerful, but severe and arbitrary dictator who has neither
time for, nor interest in questions, and who cares for nothing from his
subjects but immediate and absolute compliance. The opposite view sees
the all-powerful Creator as an indulgent parent who cannot bear to bring an
evildoer to justice, but who lets things run their natural course rather than
interpose. Such incomplete pictures of God fail to portray the truth about
Him.

12. What can be expected by those who do not experience righteous-
    ness? Prov. 11:5, 23.



   The consistent teaching of Scripture is that only the righteous will enjoy
eternal life with Christ. (See Matt. 25:46; Heb. 12:14.) The sinner who
refuses to accept Christ's power to stop sinning and the gift of His right-
eousness has no hope beyond the grave. (See Rev. 20:9, 15.)

13. When Moses insisted on a revelation of God's glory, what did he
    see, and what did he hear? Ex. 34:5-7 (compare Ps. 145:8, 17, 20).




   Notice that, according to Exodus 34:7, there are two aspects to God's
love: (1) He has "mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgres-
sion and sin." (2) He "will by no means clear the guilty." These two
points do not represent contradictory elements in God's character. The
most loving thing for a redeeming God to do is to forgive the person who
accepts the sacrifice of His Son, and to hold guilty the person who rejects
that sacrifice. It is not unloving for God to manifest wrath against sin and,
consequently, against the person who refuses to be separated from it. "The
Lord preserveth them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy"
(Ps. 145:20).

   God wishes to take away guilt. "God is Himself the source of all
mercy. . . . He does not ask if we are worthy of His love, but He pours
upon us the riches of His love to make us worthy. He is not vindictive. He
seeks not to punish, but to redeem. Even the severity which He manifests
through His providences is manifested for the salvation of the way-
ward. . . . It is true that God 'will by no means clear the guilty' (Exodus
34:7), but He would take away the guilt."—Thoughts From the Mount of
Blessing, p. 22.

14. How does this depiction of God's character harmonize with the
    severity of His judgments described in the following passages?
    Did God cause the destruction described?

     Gen. 6:5-7, 11-13

74
 Like Father, Like Child                                    December 7
    Gen. 18:32; 19:24, 25

    Ex. 11:4-7

   Emergency measures. In both His teachings and His life, Jesus demon-
strated what God is like. (See John 14:9.) The God of the Sermon on the
Mount and the God who destroyed the world by the Flood are one and the
same. (See 2 Peter 3:5, 6; Heb. 13:8.) While God expresses Himself most
fully in the life of Christ, the tragic existence of sin requires His interven-
tion.
   Extreme situations sometimes require major "surgery," as in the cases
of both the antediluvian world and the city of Sodom. Civilization in
general had become so vile as to be a moral menace to humanity. Because
God is perfect in character, perfect in wisdom, in love, in righteousness,
and in justice, He cannot do other than deal in perfect fairness with evil
and with sinners who persist in sinning. (See Heb. 10:30.) God's moral
response to sin and sinners was fully demonstrated at Calvary.

   The wrath of God. "Satan and all who have joined him in rebellion
will be cut off. . . . This is not an act of arbitrary power on the part of God.
The rejecters of His mercy reap that which they have sown. God is the
fountain of life; and when one chooses the service of sin, he separates from
God, and thus cuts himself off from life. He is 'alienated from the life of
God.' Christ says, 'All they that hate me love death.' Eph. 4:18; Prov.
8:36. God gives them existence for a time that they may develop their
character and reveal their principles. This accomplished, they receive the
results of their own choice. By a life of rebellion, Satan and all who unite
with him place themselves so out of harmony with God that His very
presence is to them a consuming fire. The glory of Him who is love will
destroy them."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 763, 764.

SELF-INVENTORY:
   • How do I find happiness? Have I found that which is true and last-
ing?
   • In my relationships with others, how do I act, or react?
   • Why should I allow God to take from me all my bitterness and
anger?
   • Realizing that the eternal Judge is my friend, who is on my side,
what keeps me from enjoying a closer relationship with Him?

SUMMARY: Happiness and contentment are treasures of superlative
value. The peace that Christ imparts is far superior to any so-called happi-
ness the world has to offer. Nothing need disturb that peace, for it is not
dependent on outward circumstances. Even though others may try to make
life miserable for us, though anger and strife rage around us, we can be
kept in the peace of heaven, for nothing can disturb us when Jesus dwells
within.




                                                                             75
      Lesson 11
      December 8-14



       A Friend for All Seasons

SAB       THERE IS MORE THAN ONE KIND OF FRIEND. When the edi-
 PM   tors of a magazine offered a prize for the best definition of a friend, they
      received thousands of responses. One person wrote: "A friend is one who
      multiplies joys, divides grief." Another suggested: "A friend is one who
      understands our silence." Yet another said: "A friend is a volume of
      sympathy bound in cloth." The definition that won the prize read: "A
      friend—the one who comes in when the whole world goes out."
          A true friend is a treasure whose worth is beyond computation. A false
      friend, or one whose life is directed by a different value system, could
      constitute a major danger. God has given insight and warning to guide us
      in the choice of our friends.
          We need to develop our social awareness, so that we might reach out in
      friendship to people where they are and minister to their needs. Reaching out
      to others is a privilege and a responsibility, as well as a spiritual gift.
      Through hospitality "some have entertained angels unawares" (Heb. 13:2).

      MEMORY TEXT: "He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but
      a companion of fools shall be destroyed" (Proverbs 13:20).

      THEME: Even though true friendship is contrasted with the danger of
      close association with unbelievers, we win souls to Christ by being so-
      ciable and hospitable, by kindness to strangers.

      OUTLINE:
         I. A True Friend or an Unwise Fool (Prov. 13:20).
        11. The Saving Value of Hospitality (Prov. 25:21, 22).
       I11. Kindness to Strangers (Prov. 31:20).

      I. A TRUE FRIEND OR AN UNWISE FOOL (Prov. 13:20).

          Deep in every heart is a longing, even a craving, for companionship,
      appreciation, belonging, and a mutual sharing of treasures, whether mate-
      rial, intellectual, or spiritual.
          Adam in Eden felt such a need before God created Eve. Lacking a
      friend with whom he could share, Adam could not have gained the greatest

possible satisfaction from the beauties of a perfect world, or the delights of
employment, exploration, and expanding powers. As a social being, he
needed the understanding, sympathy, and companionship of one who
shared his nature. He needed someone with whom he could share human
love.

1. What reason did God give for providing a companion for Adam?
   Gen. 2:18.



   Friendship within marriage. Marriage is especially meaningful when
husband and wife are best friends. No other feature of the marriage rela-
tionship can replace friendship. As friends, husband and wife can com-
municate about mutual joys, challenges, and sorrows. Spiritually and
psychologically our lives are enriched by the experience of having a part-
ner who is a closer friend than any other human being.

   Friendship for singles. Those who have chosen not to marry may
enjoy the enriching experience of having close personal friends. Everyone
needs someone with whom he or she can share confidences, joys, and
sorrows. Though unmarried, the apostle Paul found deep satisfaction in the
relationship of mutual dependence that he enjoyed with his fellow laborers.
(See Phil. 4:3.) Because we have been created social beings, we achieve
our full potential in association with others.

2. By what comparison does Solomon indicate the value of a friend?
   What advice does he give? Prov. 27:9, 10 (compare 17:17).



   Ointment and perfume were often very expensive. Usually composed of
olive oil, sweet spices, gum resins, or other aromatics, and often preserved
in alabaster jars, these ointments were a sought-after luxury in Palestine.
   Some friends may be more like a cheap fragrance—easy to procure,
easy to give up, and not particularly valuable as companions. A true Chris-
tian friend, who gives help and hope, and who inspires calming faith, is
rare. Such a friend is worth more than gold and silver. (See Sons and
Daughters of God, p. 161.)

    A beautiful friendship. The friendship between Helen Keller, who
could neither see nor hear, and her teacher, Anne Sullivan, is one of the
most beautiful illustrations of the Bible teaching. Anne was born poor and
half blind. After an operation partially restored her sight, she devoted her
life to work for the blind. With tender love and patience she taught Helen
to "see," "hear," and communicate. For forty-nine years Helen and Anne
were inseparable. When Anne became blind later in life, Helen returned
her kindness by helping her overcome the disability. After Anne's death,
Helen said: "I pray for strength to endure the silent dark until she smiles
upon me again."

                                                                            77
        Lesson 11                                                 December 14
      3. What vital principle should be kept in mind when choosing one's
         friends? Prov. 13:20.


          Friendship influences character. Not only are we judged by the com-
      pany we keep ("birds of a feather flock together") but we tend to assimilate
      the characteristics of our friends. "By beholding we become changed." We
      are shaped and fashioned by the people and even things that we love.
          "The youth fail to realize how sensibly both their character and their
      reputation are affected by their choice of associates. . . . As a stream
      always partakes of the property of the soil through which it runs, so the
      principles and habits of youth invariably become tinctured with the charac-
      ter of the company in which they mingle."—Messages to Young People,
      pp. 411, 412.
         Since we are inevitably influenced by our friends, let us choose them
      wisely.
MON   4. What reason is given for the strong caution expressed in Proverbs
         24:1, 2?



          Fostering an inclination or cherishing a desire usually results in giving in
      to it. While we cannot of ourselves change our hearts or control our inclina-
      tions and impulses, we do have the power of choice and can give our wills to
      God. "We can choose to serve God . . . then He will work in us to will and
      to do according to His good pleasure. Thus our whole nature will be brought
      under the control of Christ."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 176.

         Close friendship with those who are not serving Christ involves
      certain hazards. Unconsciously we are likely to absorb their habits. Their
      disrespect for our spiritual and moral commitments may lead us to weaken
      and lean toward their lifestyle. Our personal purity and reputation can
      become tarnished by too close an association with those whose moral and
      ethical standards are not in harmony with the Christian gospel.

         Since association with unbelieving friends is fraught with spiritual
      danger, how can a Christian maintain spiritual integrity while seeking
      to win others to Christ? How does our motive have a determining
      effect on this process?
      5. What can we learn about true friends from Proverbs 27:6?
         (Compare Prov. 27:17; John 15:13.)



          "Deceitful" kisses bring to mind Judas the betrayer. In direct contrast
      is the Friend of friends who "was wounded for our transgressions, he was
      bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and
      with his stripes we are healed" (Isa. 53:5).
      78
 A Friend for All Seasons                                December 14
   Three kinds of friend. "People learn from one another, just as iron
sharpens iron" (Prov. 27:17, TEV). In order to make our learning well-
rounded, we need three kinds of friend.
   The friend we most readily recognize is a peer, someone with whom
we share ideals, concepts, and plans, one who stimulates us to be our best
and achieve the most for the right reasons and the highest purposes.
   We also need a model, someone who personifies the goals we have set
for ourselves, who has traveled the path before us, and to whom we can
look for wise counsel. Segregation of generations has brought unnecessary
trauma and loneliness for the senior members of society, while at the same
time robbing those who could benefit from their long experience.
   There is the friend who looks up to us in admiration, regarding us as
a pattern. We need to cherish the opportunity to be a friend to such a
person, though the relationship may not be to our personal advantage. Only
in eternity will we know the extent of our influence on such a person.
   Bigotry, exclusiveness, and favoritism will find no place in the heart of
the true Christian. We need to remember "the Christlikeness of exhibiting
a kindly interest, a social disposition, toward those who are in the greatest
need, even though these may not be . . . [our] own chosen companions."—
Messages to Young People, p. 406.

6. What are the pitfalls in having the kinds of friend described in
   Proverbs 19:4, 6?



   Jesus' parable of the prodigal son (Luke 15:11-32) provides a prime
example. Many "friends" took advantage of his generous nature, and
helped him spend his money. But when it was wasted and gone, so were
they. They cared nothing for him in his need, but only for themselves and
what they could get.

7. Why is the counsel given in Proverbs 17:9 so important? Why is
   criticism and gossip so damaging to friendship?



   The danger of criticism. Repeating critical stories we hear about
people is hazardous for a number of reasons. The report we heard might be
only partly true. The person about whom the story was told will lose
confidence in us if we repeat a slanted, biased account. If the story is true,
the manner in which we tell it may give a false impression. Even if our
account is strictly factual, the person listening to us may put his own
construction on it and repeat it incorrectly. We can then be blamed for a
story that we did not intend to circulate.

   Speak evil of no man; hear evil of no man. "No Christian parent
should permit gossip to be repeated in the family circle or remarks to be
made disparaging the members of the church."—Testimonies, vol. 5,
p. 242.
   "Speak evil of no man. Hear evil of no man. If there be no hearers,
                                                                           79

      there will be no speakers of evil. If anyone speaks evil in your presence,
      check him. Refuse to hear him, though his manner be ever so soft and his
      accents mild. He may profess attachment, and yet throw out covert hints
      and stab the character in the dark."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 54.

         Think of the dearest friend you have ever known. What especially
      endeared you to this person? Now think of a person who claimed to be
      your friend but with whom you were unable to establish a close, mean-
      ingful relationship. Why could you not establish friendship with this
      person? Was the fault partly yours?

WED   11. THE SAVING VALUE OF HOSPITALITY (Prov. 25:21, 22).

         While the Christian's best and most intimate friends should be those
      who share his principles and convictions, it is also true that sanctified
      social power can be a means of blessing others and bringing them into a
      proper relationship with God.

      8. An enemy can sometimes be made a friend by social contact of the
         right kind. How does the Bible writer suggest we go about this?
         Prov. 25:21, 22.



         One of Abraham Lincoln's associates once complained about his atti-
      tude to his enemies. "Why do you try to make friends of them?" he said.
      "You should try to destroy them." Lincoln gently replied: "Am I not
      destroying my enemies when I make them my friends?"

          Souls are won by friendship. Those who do not understand the distinc-
      tive message of Seventh-day Adventists can be attracted to Christ and His
      love as we include them in our social occasions. When we are insular and
      separatist, unable to relate to people in a relaxed social setting, they are not
      attracted to our message. Kindness is hard to resist; most people are melted
      by it.

      9. What influence did Jesus have at a social function? John 2:1-11.



          "The example of Christ in linking Himself with the interests of
      humanity should be followed by all who preach His word, and by all who
      have received the gospel of His grace. We are not to renounce social
      communion. We should not seclude ourselves from others. In order to
      reach all classes, we must meet them where they are. They will seldom
      seek us of their own accord. . . .
          "Let the world see that we are not selfishly absorbed in our own inter-
      ests, but that we desire others to share our blessings and privileges. Let
      them see that our religion does not make us unsympathetic or exacting. Let
      all who profess to have found Christ, minister as He did for the benefit of
      men."—The Desire of Ages, p. 152.

   Jesus associated with sinful people. In fact, the religious leaders of the
day strongly criticized Him for it. (See Luke 5:30-32; 7:33, 34.) Jesus
pointed out that He was associating with sinners because they needed His
ministry. Never did He condone or excuse sin, and never did He enter into
the evil pleasures and activities of the people for whom He was working.
But He staunchly resisted the pompous exclusiveness of the Pharisees.
Jesus demonstrated that social outcasts can be won for His kingdom, and
can become most effective reflectors of His love and witnesses for His
truth.

   Does your local church conduct social programs that are attractive
to those who are not members? Have you considered cooking classes,
health instruction, stress-management and weight-control classes, and
home and family seminars? Do you have church hospitality dinners
for visitors on Sabbath? If you have been doing things of this kind,
what results have you seen?
   What about unstructured social occasions in your home to which
you invite nonbelievers? Have you tried to incorporate them into the
circle of your friends? Perhaps they can be influenced by such an
indirect approach, without the usual planned teaching situation.

I11. KINDNESS TO STRANGERS (Prov. 31:20).

10. What is one class of strangers whose lot in life we are urged to
    relieve? Prov. 21:13; 31:20. How would you suggest individuals
    and the church should go about following this counsel?



    Have you considered the needs of the homeless in your community?
Some conferences have begun a special ministry to these helpless people.
If your church is located in or near a large city, is there something you can
do for the homeless and the jobless?

11. What directive is common to the following scriptures? Rom.
    12:10-13; 1 Peter 4:9, 10.



    "These admonitions have been strangely neglected. . . . Among our
own people the opportunity of showing hospitality is not regarded as it
should be, as a privilege and a blessing. There is altogether too little
sociability, too little of a disposition to make room for two or three more
at the family board, without embarrassment or parade. . . . By the unex-
pected guest a welcome is appreciated far more than is the most elaborate
preparation."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 343.

   "Do not forget to entertain strangers, for by so doing some people have
entertained angels without knowing it" (Heb. 13:2, NIV). What a privi-
lege! But angels are with us always, whether or not we can see them. They
enjoy being in homes where love and kindness are expressed in words,
                                                                          81
  Lesson 11                                                December 14
looks, and actions, and they are pleased at the sight of a well-regulated,
orderly family that is willing to share good things with others. (See Coun-
sels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, p. 115; Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 259;
vol. 6, p. 342.)

MY PLEDGE: Check the statements below that you want to incorporate
into your own experience:
         I will pray that God will make me capable of friendship.
         I will choose close friends who will help rather than hinder my
           spiritual life.
         I will seek to develop my social powers, so as to reach souls
           for God's kingdom.
         I will gladly share with others what God has entrusted to me.

  List three practical ways you can show hospitality to others this next
week:

     3.

FOR FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: For Bible examples of
true friendship read Ruth 1:16; 1 Sam. 18:1; 2 Kings 2:2; Matt. 27:55, 56.
    "If choice is made of companions who fear the Lord, the influence will
lead to truth, to duty, and to holiness. A truly Christian life is a power for
good. But, on the other hand, those who associate with men and women of
questionable morals, of bad principles and practices, will soon be walking
in the same path. . . . To walk in the counsel of the ungodly is the first step
toward standing in the way of sinners and sitting in the seat of the scorn-
 ful."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 587.
    "The warmth of true friendship, the love that binds heart to heart, is a
foretaste of the joys of heaven."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 360.

SUMMARY: As we grow closer to God, we will also find closer unity
and harmony with others who are likewise committed. As we study to
advance the happiness of others and share with them the good things God
has lent us, we experience the joy of cooperating with heaven. In our
hospitality toward others, we demonstrate the character of God. Angels
eagerly wait to work through us for others.

SAB      MARRIAGE IS PULLING TOGETHER THROUGH LIFE. In
PM    Iowa is the little country church that has been associated romantically with
      the song "The Little Brown Church in the Wildwood." Every year
      hundreds of weddings are conducted there. One of its ministers adopted a
      novel and beautiful way of saying farewell to the couples he had married.
      After the ceremony he would lead the couple to the entry and say, "Before
      you go, the bride has the honor of ringing the church bell." He then placed
      the rope in her hands. She would pull with all her might only to discover
      that she was not strong enough to move the heavy bell. Then the minister
      would turn to the groom and ask him to lend his bride a hand. Together
      they would pull the rope, and the bell would ring, announcing that another
      couple had begun life together. Then the minister would say, "As you go
      out into life, never forget that as long as you pull together, you can ring the
      bell."
         This week's lesson deals with passages in the book of Proverbs that
      deal with marriage. We will also look at other scriptures to develop the
      picture of God's gift as He gave it. Then we will understand why any
      perversion of His original masterpiece wreaks such havoc and devastation.

      MEMORY TEXT: "Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a
      woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised" (Proverbs 31:30).

      THEME: By contrast with the destructive effects of infidelity and im-
      morality, happy marriage is a beautiful, enriching expedition through life.
      As husband and wife experience united fellowship with Christ, they also
      develop an ever closer love bond between themselves.

     I. MARRIAGE—A DIVINE MASTERPIECE (Prov. 18:22).

     1. According to Proverbs 19:14, where can a man find an intelligent,
        sensible, and understanding wife?


        "What God hath joined together." The last part of the verse may be
     translated: "But from the Lord is a woman who acts prudently." The
     Hebrew verb means "to act wisely, understandingly, with insight and com-
     prehension." A woman who acts in that manner is truly the gift of God.
     The Lord is the ultimate matchmaker. No one knows better the secret
     needs of each individual, and no one has the same ability to bring together
     the right two persons. Because He is the divine Father of love, no one can
     care as much as He, or provide better for the happiness of the couple He
     has united.
         Why is a good wife from the Lord? Could it be because she has.first
     given herself to Him? Wisdom, purity, and insight in the Bible sense are
     gifts of Christ to those who believe in Him. The Holy Spirit draws two
     devoted believers together. They consult their own convictions and prefer-
     ences, and they listen to the counsel of their parents and their spiritual
     mentors; but in the final analysis they seek to follow God's will. True love
     is born in heaven!

     2. What activity did God provide for Adam before the creation of
        Eve? Why? Gen. 2:18-23.


         When the animals were brought to Adam to receive their names, he
     noticed that to each had been given a mate, but there was no one for him.
     It is possible that God wanted Adam to recognize his lack, that he might
     better appreciate the gift He had in mind. God had a beautiful plan to
     supply Adam's need. Man was not created to dwell in solitude; he was a
     social being.

     3. What words did God use to pronounce the union between Adam
        and Eve? Gen. 2:24 (compare Matt. 19:4-6).


         The physical union of a man and his wife is a representation of the total
     bonding of their lives. They are united not only physically but also men-
     tally, emotionally, and spiritually. The love that is shared between them is
     like no other; two have become one.
ii 4. After the Fall, what change took place in the marriage relation-
         ship? Gen. 3:16; Eph. 5:22-24.


     84
  Drink From Your Own Spring                              December 21
   Someone must be the leader. "In the creation God had made 'her
[Eve] the equal of Adam. Had they remained obedient to God—in har-
mony with His great law of love—they would ever have been in harmony
with each other; but sin had brought discord, and now their union could be
maintained and harmony preserved only by submission on the part of the
one or the other. Eve had been the first in transgression. . . . It was by her
solicitation that Adam sinned, and she was now placed in subjection to her
husband. Had the principles enjoined in the law of God been cherished by
the fallen race, this sentence, though growing out of the results of sin,
would have proved a blessing to them; but man's abuse of the supremacy
thus given him has too often rendered the lot of woman very bitter and
made her life a burden."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 58, 59.

5. What counsel does Paul give to husbands? Eph. 5:25-33.



   Paul uses the mystery of marital love to illustrate the mystery of our
love relationship with Christ. Subjection to the leadership of such love is
not grievous. "The Lord has constituted the husband the head of the wife
to be her protector; he is the house-band of the family, binding the mem-
bers together, even as Christ is head of the church."—The Adventist
Home, p. 215.

    Preserve equality and individuality. One of the purposes of the gospel
is to restore the marriage relation to the state of harmony and equality that
existed in Eden. Husbands who function as domestic dictators are not
following the biblical ideal of marriage. Are they willing to attend lovingly
to their wives as Christ attends to the church? Are they willing to sacrifice
for their wives and, if necessary, lay down their lives for them, as Christ
has done for the church? The concept held by some men that a wife should
submit obediently to their injunctions is bound to create marital unhappi-
ness. A wife should be treated as an equal partner in the decision-making
process. Her feelings and her will should be tenderly considered by her
husband, and he should do all in his power to contribute to her sense of
personal worth.
    "Let each give love rather than exact it. . . . The consciousness of being
appreciated is a wonderful stimulus and satisfaction. Sympathy and respect
encourage the striving after excellence, and love itself increases as it
stimulates to nobler aims. . . .
    "Neither the husband nor the wife should attempt to exercise over the
other an arbitrary control. Do not try to compel each other to yield to your
wishes. You cannot do this and retain each other's love."—The Ministry
of Healing, p. 361.
    To one husband Ellen White wrote: "Brother B should soften; he
 should cultivate refinement and courtesy. He should be very tender and
gentle toward his wife, who is his equal in every respect; he should not
 utter a word that would cast a shadow upon her heart. He should begin the
 work of reformation at home; he should cultivate affection and overcome
 the coarse, harsh, unfeeling and ungenerous traits of his disposition."—
 The Adventist Home, p. 227 (italics supplied).

si   6. What counsel is given in 1 Corinthians 7:3-5 regarding sexual ex-
         pression in marriage?



         The "due benevolence" of verse 3 (KJV) refers to "conjugal rights"
      (RSV). The passage is not discussing money matters, but sexual inter-
      course within marriage. "Defraud ye not one the other" (verse 5) means,
      "Do not deprive one another of sexual satisfaction."
         Inspiration tells us here that abstinence from marital sex may be neces-
      sary sometimes, as the married couple give themselves wholly to seeking
      the Lord; just as sometimes they may go without food for the same pur-
      pose. But the warning is: "Then come together again so that Satan will not
      tempt you because of your lack of self-control" (verse 5, NIV).
         The point is not that, if you cannot exercise self-control, you should use
      your mate as an outlet for your carnal appetite. The point is that sex within
      marriage, practiced in the spirit of unselfish love, is a beautiful gift of God,
      designed to foster and express the marital bond and to enrich the lives of
      both partners physically, emotionally, and spiritually.

        Have you examined your own contribution to your marriage lately?
     Are you always kind in the way you speak to your partner, or do you
     speak cutting, ill-tempered words? Do you give your partner praise
     and appreciation, or do you destructively criticize his or her efforts,
     appearance, friendships, or manner of life? Do you treat your partner
     as Jesus treats those who love Him?

      11. STRANGE PERVERSION (Prov. 5:18-20).

     7. What counsel does Solomon emphasize regarding immorality?

          Prov. 2:16-19

          Prov. 5:1-13

          Prov. 6:23-33

          Prov. 7:4-27

        A protecting hedge. In our world today it is common to regard Bible
     teaching on moral questions as old-fashioned and incompatible with the
     demands of modern existence. But, in His mercy, God has given us a
     moral law as a protecting hedge to keep us from physical suffering,
     emotional instability, and spiritual emptiness.

         If there were no patrons, there would be no prostitues. When the
     sexual union is indulged outside of marriage, as in premarital or extramari-
     tal affairs (or in perversions), the relationship is destructive of spiritual and
     emotional health, and so is contrary to God's will. It may also be destruc-
     tive of physical health. Individuals are betrayed and traumatized, never to
     be quite the same in this life.
     86
       Drink From Your Own Spring                               December 21
          God will forgive anyone who sincerely repents; yet scars remain. This
      is a warning to those who might think that, because God will forgive, they
      can live as they please without suffering dire results. (See Prov. 9:13-18.)

         Drink from your own well. In discussing the danger of moral impurity,
      Solomon counsels: "Drink water from your own cistern, running water
      from your own well. . . . May your fountain be blessed, and may you
      rejoice in the wife of your youth" (Prov. 5:15, 18, NIV).

WED   8. In what way did the teaching of Jesus in Matthew 5:27-30 magnify
         the seventh commandment (Ex. 20:14)?



         Adultery in the heart. "Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied, and
      never satisfied are the eyes of man" (Prov. 27:20, RSV).
         "He who finds pleasure in dwelling upon scenes of impurity, who indul-
      ges the evil thought, the lustful look, may behold in the open sin, with its
      burden of shame and heartbreaking grief, the true nature of the evil which he
      has hidden in the chambers of the soul. The season of temptation, under
      which, it may be, one falls into grievous sin, does not create the evil that is
      revealed, but only develops or makes manifest that which was hidden and
      latent in the heart."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 60.
         If a woman is party to a man's lust, how could she be innocent herself?
      Christian women particularly have a responsibility to clothe themselves in
      "modest apparel" (1 Tim. 2:9, 10) that neither attracts undue attention nor
      reveals the body in a manner as to be sexually provocative.

         What attitude do you adopt to a person in your church who has
      fallen into moral impurity? Do you condemn and criticize, or do you
      look for ways to be redemptive? How would you go about helping such
      a person rise above the mistakes of the past and accept Christ's saving
      grace? How did Jesus work for people who had fallen?

      I11. A QUARRELSOME SPOUSE (Prov. 21:19).

        The book of Proverbs addresses counsel to wives on this subject, but it
      applies equally to men.

      9. How is the problem of a nagging spouse illustrated? Prov. 27:15
         (compare 19:13; 21:9, 19).



          "Leaking roofs were common in the East, and the constant dripping
      tried the nerves of the inhabitants much as does a nagging woman."
          "In ancient Palestine for most of the year a man might live in compara-
      tive comfort on the flat roof of his house. . . . Solomon contends that it is
      better to be exposed to the wind and rain than to the quarrelsome and
      vexing tongue of a contentious woman."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3,
      pp. 1012, 1018.
                                                                                  87
 Lesson 12                                             December 21
10. What counsel for all Christians is particularly appropriate for a
    quarrelsome spouse? Eph. 4:29.



   Attitude reform can begin in more than one place. The ill-natured
person can determine to consecrate his or her heart and lips to God, and
speak only words that will minister grace to the hearers. God will give the
power for this noble task.
   The marriage partner can also help. Sincere words of positive apprecia-
tion given from a heart of love go a long way toward soothing the troubled
nerves of a distracted spouse. Just knowing somebody cares—especially
the one you love most—lifts a great burden from the heart.

IV. A VIRTUOUS SPOUSE (Prov. 31:10-31).

   Who can find a virtuous woman? The question implies a rarity, al-
though not a total lack. The real question is: Who can be a virtuous
woman? Every woman can. For God is in the business of making men and
women virtuous, of helping them build noble characters, equal to the bur-
dens and demands of daily life.

11. What is the value of a virtuous woman? Prov. 31:10. For whose
    crown is she the jewel? Prov. 12:4; 31:11.



   Pure rubies belong to the royalty of the mineral world, being hard,
flawlessly transparent, dazzling in color, and rare.

12. How are these positive traits revealed in her character?

     Diligence (Prov. 31:13, 17, 18, 27)



     Efficiency (Prov. 31:14, 16, 24)



     Compassion (Prov. 31:20, 26)



     Beauty (Prov. 31:22, 25)



   All of the above are traits that can be possessed by any woman, married
or single. By the grace of God, any woman can be truly virtuous.
   Her rewards are great, for those who know her best call her blessed.
88
  Drink From Your Own Spring                             December 21
The husband of such a woman praises her (Prov. 31:28, 29). Her peers
are challenged by her example, and her works bring honor to her loved
ones and to herself. Best of all, the God she loves is glorified in her life
(Prov. 31:30).

13. How does the Bible describe the kind of husband a man should
    be? 1 Peter 3:7 (compare Ps. 14:1-5; Eccl. 9:9).



   A humble, gentle man of integrity who loves and honors his wife is
pleasing to the Lord. By contrast, the prayers of husbands who misuse their
wives will be "hindered" (1 Peter 3:7), or unanswered. How can a man
who fails to claim Christ's grace so that he might be the loving husband
envisioned in Scripture expect God to answer his prayers? The Lord re-
quires him to give his wife and family the understanding, mercy, forgive-
ness, and kindness that heaven has extended to him. True greatness begins
at home. If a man's wife and family adore him as the best of husbands and
fathers, what other recommendation could he wish for in this world?

ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE:
   • What am I contributing to my relationships that will be a blessing
and gain a blessing?
   • In what ways am I a hindrance to my spouse? Am I willing to
change? How can I change?
   • Am I a quarrelsome person? If I were to change the manner in which
I react to things that displease me, would I bring greater happiness to my
spouse?
   • How can I become more like the virtuous woman or the man of
integrity spoken of in Scripture?

SUMMARY: God is the author and designer of marriage and of all noble
human relationships. The more faithful our human associations, the deeper
becomes our understanding of our Creator and the relationship He yearns
to share with us. With growing understanding comes abhorrence of un-
faithfulness and contentiousness—not only because of the results to the
sinner, but because God is thereby misrepresented and those we love are
hurt. In our relationships with others we are to be living witnesses of God's
saving grace.

      December 22-28



           No Pruning, No Grapes

SAB       NO CROSS, NO CROWN. "A grapevine says in the early spring,
 PM   `How glad I am to get through the winter! I shall have no more trouble
      now! Summer weather will come, and the garden will be very beautiful!'
      But the gardener comes, and cuts the vine here and there with his knife.
      The twigs begin to fall, and the grapevine calls out, 'Murder! What are you
      cutting me for?' Ah,' says the gardener, 'I don't mean to kill you. If I did
      not do this, you would be the laughingstock of all the other vines before
      the season is over.' Months go on, and one day the gardener comes under
      the trellis, where the great clusters of grapes hang, and the grapevine says,
      `Thank you, sir, you could not have done anything so kind as to cut me
      with that knife. . . .' No pruning, no grapes; no grinding mill, no flour; no
      battle, no victory; no cross, no crown."—T. Dewitt Talmage.
          A Christian is a disciple of Christ; a child is a disciple of his parents. Is
      acceptance of the truthfulness of Christ's teaching all that is involved in
      being His disciple? Does discipline make a person into a disciple, or does
      it encourage a disciple to be more like Jesus? The discussion of these
      questions in this week's lesson is designed to encourage us to be disciples
      of the Lord Jesus Christ who have learned to claim His power.

      MEMORY TEXT: "My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart
      keep my commandments" (Proverbs 3:1).

      THEME. A true disciple of Christ is a disciplined individual. Discipline is
      not merely punishment; in the Bible it is spoken of as the total training of
      the believer in Christ. Discipline is the process by which the disciple grows
      in grace, learning to depend fully upon Christ's power for self-government,
      power to obey His holy law. "The object of discipline is . . . self-govern-
      ment."—Education, p. 287. Subjection to Christ is restoration to freedom
      and to our true selves. (See The Desire of Ages, p. 466.)

I. PARENTING (Prov. 22:6).

   "To parents is committed the great work of educating and training their
children for the future, immortal life. . . . No work ever undertaken by man
requires greater skill than the proper training and education of youth and
children. . . . The nature of man is threefold, and the training enjoined by
Solomon comprehends the right development of the physical, intellectual,
and moral powers."—Child Guidance, pp. 38, 39.

1. What is the meaning of the action word train in Proverbs 22:6?



   "Solomon did not say, 'Tell a child the way he should go, and when he
is old, he will not depart from it.' But 'Train up a child.' "—Child
Guidance, p. 38. Because children learn from example, illustration, and
experience, as well as from words, we should employ all these avenues of
teaching. No method used exclusively will be adequate.

   Parental training is not the only influence in a child's life. For the
sake of parents who have followed closely the Bible counsel in the training
of their children, only to see them leave the Lord, we should point out that
the general principle stated in Proverbs 22:6 can be broken by the child's
own will. A child who does not go astray has usually been trained cor-
rectly; but unfortunately, the child who has been trained correctly at home
may choose to succumb to other influences. The text states a general
principle to which there are exceptions. Cain, Esau, and Judas are typical
examples.

2. What relationships between children and parents are spoken of in
   the following passages?

   Prov. 10:1

   Prov. 27:11

   Prov. 28:7

   Prov. 29:15

   Prov. 30:11-14

   Each individual has been given freedom of choice. In that sense, each is
the arbiter of his own destiny. This being the case, the waywardness of an
offspring cannot necessarily be blamed on negligent or faulty parenting.
God Himself lost one third of His heavenly family through no fault of His
own. Even so, mothers and fathers have special responsibilities.

   Some parents are too occupied to train their children. "Many
fathers and mothers seem to think that if they feed and clothe their little
ones, and educate them according to the standard of the world, they have
                                                                          91
        Lesson 13                                               December 28
      done their duty. They are too much occupied with business or pleasure to
      make the education of their children the study of their lives. They do not
      seek to train them so that they will employ their talents for the honor of
      their Redeemer."—Child Guidance, p. 38.

MON   3. How are children disciplined? Prov. 3:11, 12; 13:24 (compare
         22:15; 23:13, 14; 29:15).



          A minister riding in a subway train got up and gave his seat to a woman
      who was standing nearby, holding onto a strap for balance. In her surprise,
      she said, "Why did you do that?" Realizing that she would not understand
      a spiritual explanation, he said to her, "Madam, I tell you, ever since I was
      a little boy, I have had an infinite respect for a woman with a strap in her
      hand."

         Corporal punishment should not be physical violence. When all else
      has failed, it may be necessary to administer physical punishment to a
      child. But violent physical abuse is totally contrary to the spirit of Christ
      and to the message of His Word. Punishment administered in anger will
      only create bitterness and resentment.

         Reason with your child. A child is a sensitive human being who will
      usually respond to love and reason. If a child is habitually naughty, there is
      usually some physical, emotional, or psychological cause. It may be some-
      thing that needs explanation, or something that creates fear or resentment.
      Communicating with the child in an attempt to draw out the real reason for
      the behavior may well result in victory over it. Some children are so
      sensitive that physical punishment can break their wills and destroy their
      legitimate self-esteem. A parent who lashes out in anger is creating future
      problems for the child and for himself.
         "Also to punish the just is not good" (Prov. 17:26). "And, ye fathers,
      provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and
      admonition of the Lord" (Eph. 6:4).

          Punishment rendered unnecessary by prayer. "There is great
      strength and blessing in praying together in our families, with and for our
      children. When my children have done wrong, and I have talked with them
      kindly and then prayed with them, I have never found it necessary after
      that to punish them. Their hearts would melt in tenderness before the Holy
      Spirit that came in answer to prayer."—Child Guidance, p. 525.
          "The mother may ask, 'Shall I never punish my child?' Whipping may
      be necessary when other resorts fail; yet she should not use the rod if it is
      possible to avoid doing so. But if milder measures prove insufficient,
      punishment that will bring the child to its senses should in love be admin-
      istered. Frequently one such correction will be enough for a lifetime, to
      show the child that he does not hold the lines of control."—Counsels to
      Parents, Teachers, and Students, p. 116.

           If you are a parent, can you say that the training you are giving
      92
 No Pruning, No Grapes                                   December 28
your children is contributing to making them faithful disciples of
Christ? Examining your heart and your conduct, what areas of im-
provement in your child training do you recognize to be necessary?

   How do the basic principles by which we should train our children
relate to manager-employee, and teacher-student relationships? How
do the same principles affect the manner in which a church should
discipline unfaithful members?

11. DESPISE NOT CORRECTION (Prov. 12:15).

   Independence is an inherent facet of human nature. We feel that we can
handle situations alone quite successfully. Christ is ignored in our haste
to do things our own way. God exercises long patience with His self-
deceived, self-reliant children.

4. What does God know about our choices, that we tend to forget?
   Prov. 16:25 (compare Jer. 10:23).



   Jesus said, "Without me ye can do nothing" (John 15:5). On the other
hand, by relying upon His power, we can do all things He expects of us.
(See Phil. 4:13.) Becoming a disciplined disciple of Jesus involves learning
to depend upon Him for grace to walk in His way. Our wills are involved
in choosing Him and in resisting evil, but Jesus is the one who lifts our
burden. (See James 4:6-8.)

5. How does Solomon categorize the person who is "right in his own
   eyes"? Prov. 12:15 (compare 13:18; 15:10; 29:1).



   A tragic illustration of these verses is found in the final chapters of the
book of Judges. The sad account underlines the tragic results of life apart
from God. "In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what
was right in his own eyes" (Judges 17:6, RSV). Confusion and violence
reigned. Where were the true disciples of Jehovah? Because few were
willing to take His counsel, there was confusion and disunity throughout
Israel.
   Even when such conditions prevail, God maintains ultimate control.
"Above the distractions of earth He sits enthroned; all things are open to
His divine survey; and from His great and calm eternity He orders that
which His providence sees best."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 417.

   How would you explain this principle of God's ultimate control to a
mother whose child has been killed by a drunk driver? (See Rom.
8:18, 28; 2 Cor. 4:17; 1 Peter 4:12.)

6. How does God want us to relate to instruction, reproof, and cor-
   rection? Prov. 3:5, 6; 4:20 (compare 5:1; 12:1).
                                                                           93
       Lesson 13                                              December 28
         Eve thought she knew better than God. When she obeyed Satan in the
      form of a serpent, she really believed he was telling her the truth. "In the
      judgment men will not be condemned because they conscientiously
      believed a lie, but because they did not believe the truth, because they
      neglected the opportunity of learning what is truth."—Patriarchs and
      Prophets, p. 55.
         Judas Iscariot's self-confidence blinded him to his own weakness of
      character. He thought he knew better than Christ. He valued his own
      wisdom and counsel above that of the Lord Himself. The inevitable result
      of such attitudes is spiritual ruin. (See The Desire of Ages, pp. 717, 718.)

WED   7. What kind of instruction are we urged to avoid? Prov. 16:22 (com-
         pare 19:27; Job 38:2).



         How do we recognize a fool? We are invited to test all counsel by the
      teachings of the Bible (Isa. 8:20) and to seek the guidance and teaching of
      the Holy Spirit in every situation (John 14:26).
         If we are listening, God has ways to get through to us. "Gray areas"
      exist in which it is difficult to know precisely what we should do. In such
      situations we need to pray much and rely on the guidance of the Holy
      Spirit. But in matters where we have been given a direct "Thus saith the
      Lord," "open-mindedness" to contradictory philosophies is no virtue.

          Ask yourself, What kind of instruction am I allowing to shape my
      life? Is it helping me along the right road?

      I11. WHAT GOD HATES (Prov. 6:16-19).

      8. List some of the things that are especially disgusting to God. Prov.
         6:16-19; 20:10-23 (compare 12:22; 15:9, 26).



         Children sing in Sabbath School, "Jesus loves me when I'm good,
      when I do the things I should; Jesus loves me when I'm bad, tho' it
      makes Him very sad." Is it true? Indeed it is! God loves the sinner, but
      not the sin. The great problem in salvation is how to save the sinner
      without saving (and thus perpetuating) the sin. But God found a way of
      escape for us; Jesus died to give us another chance at life. Through the
      provisions of the cross we can be made free from "the law of sin and
      death" (Rom. 8:2).
         There are those who become so bound to sin that it is inseparable from
      them. When the sin is destroyed, they must be destroyed with it.

      9. What attitude does the Lord have to religious practices that do not
         come from hearts of love to Him? Prov. 15:8; 21:27; 28:9.



      94
      No Pruning, No Grapes                                   December 28
        The sacrifices and prayers of those who are not right with God are a
     farce, a façade. When, by faith, the sinner appropriates Christ's merits, his
     religious services and sacrifices are accepted. Christ has promised, "Him
     that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out" (John 6:37).


II   IV. HEART WORK (Prov. 3:1).

     10. What problem persisted among God's chosen people in both Old
         Testament times and when Jesus walked among them? Isa. 29:13,
         14; Matt. 15:7-9. To what extent does this problem still exist
         today? Rev. 3:14-20.



        We are Laodicea. Our problem stems from the spiritual condition of
     our hearts. We are lukewarm. If we were cold, the Lord says, we would be
     better off: we would be more likely to wake up, recognize our pathetic
     condition, and seek His help. If our heart were truly filled with His Spirit,
     we would be "hot." Too often we attempt to reform by applying mere
     rules and regulations without genuine heart surrender to God.

     11. Where does God begin the work of transformation? Prov. 23:26;
         3:1 (compare Rom. 12:2).



        Having our names on the church membership books is not sufficient.
     "Profession is as nothing in the scale. It is character that decides
     destiny."—Christ' s Object Lessons, p. 74.
        The majority of God's people are still in the churches around us, wait-
     ing to be called out by the moving invitation of the Holy Spirit. (See Rev.
     18:1-4; The Great Controversy, pp. 390, 464; Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 41.) If
     we seek Him with all our heart the Lord will pour upon us the Holy Spirit
     so that we will have the spiritual power to reach honest souls who need to
     hear the final invitation of mercy.

     12. What remedy for our condition is offered by the Great
         Physician? Eze. 36:26, 27 (compare Rom. 7:14, 24, 25).



        "Who can say, 'I have kept my heart pure; I am clean and without
     sin'?" (Prov. 20:9, NIV). The answer to this rhetorical question is obvious.
     No one can make such a claim. "For all have sinned, and come short of
     the glory of God" (Rom. 3:23).

       Look to Christ for deliverance. "Be not discouraged because your
     heart seems hard. Every obstacle, every internal foe, only increases your
     need of Christ. He came to take away the heart of stone, and give you a
     heart of flesh. Look to Him for special grace to overcome your peculiar
     faults."—Messages to Young People, p. 112.
                                                                                95
  Lesson 13                                               December 28
    The Lord's plea to us is: "Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of
it are the issues of life" (Prov. 4:23).
    "All true obedience comes from the heart. It was heart work with
Christ. And if we consent, He will so identify Himself with our thoughts
and aims, so blend our hearts and minds into conformity to His will, that
when obeying Him we shall be but carrying out our own impulses."—The
Desire of Ages, p. 668.

WHAT RELEVANCE DOES THIS HAVE FOR MY LIFE?
   • Do I represent God accurately to my children? Do I combine love
and justice, mercy and truth, in all my dealings with them?
  • How do I learn to depend on Christ to direct my steps? How can I
come to the point of accepting His leading in my life?
  • Do I learn from the experience of others, or do I insist on trying
everything myself?
  • How will my life change when I cease living it my own independent
way, and allow God to recreate me a true disciple in the image of His Son?

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION:
   "If parents would see a different state of things in their family, let them
consecrate themselves wholly to God, and the Lord will devise ways and
means whereby a transformation may take place in their households."—
Child Guidance, p. 172 (italics supplied).
   "Human pride and wisdom will prove to be a dangerous guide. That
which the heart desires contrary to the will of God will in the end be found
a curse rather than a blessing."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 606. (See
also The Desire of Ages, p. 307.)

SUMMARY: Discipleship is a matter of the heart. The greatest privilege
and highest duty of a parent is to lead his child to give his heart to God.
The discipline of a child is to minor as closely as possible God's manner
of treating us, and is to focus on the same end—that of conformity to His
will through the power of the Holy Spirit. We are enabled to hate what He
hates and love what He loves. Then we will represent His character accu-
rately to the world.

       Lessons for First Quarter, 1992
   Sabbath School members who have not received a copy of the adult
Sabbath School lessons for the first quarter of 1992 will be helped by the
following outline in studying the first two lessons. The title of the series is
No Time to Lose. This quarter's lessons cover the books of Joel, Micah,
and Zephaniah.

First Lesson: "The Day of the Lord"
STUDY TEXT: Joel 1:1-2:11.

MEMORY TEXT: "Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm
in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for
the day of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh at hand" (Joel 2:1).

THEME: The day of the Lord describes God's past judgments and
points to the final judgment at the end of time. This lesson challenges
us to sense the nearness of the close of probation and Christ's second
coming, and urges us to let the Lord complete His work in our hearts
and lives.

Second Lesson: Revival and Reformation
STUDY TEXT: Joel 2:12-17

MEMORY TEXT: "And rend your heart, and not your garments,
and turn unto the Lord your God: for he is gracious and merciful,
slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil"
(Joel 2:13).

THEME: The Lord calls for revival among His children. To seek the
Lord's blessing there must be earnest effort and a sense of urgency.
Then the Lord can bless His people.
