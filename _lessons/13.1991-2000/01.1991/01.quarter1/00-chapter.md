   What sometimes appears to be politically disruptive to a country,
often turns out for the good of people and the growth of the church.
   Prior to the change of government in Fiji in May 1987, it appeared
as if the Indian population on these beautiful South Pacific islands
was very indifferent to the Christian faith. However, the tide is
turning.
   In recent outreach initiatives to Fiji's Indian population of about
400,000 people, a new wave of receptivity has been detected. Every
evangelistic outreach program is now also yielding some favourable
response from the Hindi-speaking Indian community.
   The Central Pacific Union Mission wants to take advantage of this
new receptivity among the Indian population by establishing a Hindi
Evangelistic Centre in Fiji. The present number of only about 200
Hindi-speaking Adventists in Fiji will be vastly increased by such a
project.
   A second project to benefit from this quarter's Thirteenth Sabbath
Offering will be a day high school in Suva, Fiji. Such a facility is badly
needed. When our youth graduate from primary school, there is no
Adventist high school for them to attend. Over 500 young people
need such a facility.
   Please give generously this Thirteenth Sabbath and all quarter
long so that these two important projects can be achieved.

            Introduction to the
             Books of Samuel
    A plaque in a mother's kitchen reads, "Lord, help us through the changes in
our lives." We human beings do not take well to changes. We resist them, we
resent them, and sometimes we reject them.
     The stories we will consider during this series are about changes in the lives
of God's people, and how they related to them. The period between the judges
and the early monarchy covered in the books of Samuel were times of transition
and change, times of political unrest and conflict in Israel and in the surrounding
nations. The twelve tribes, initially bound together in a sort of loose confederacy,
had no central government. "In those days there was no king in Israel: everyone
did what was right in his own eyes" (Judges 21:25, NKJV). With the emergence
of the kingship, adaptation and adjustment did not always take place smoothly.
Serious conflicts had to be resolved, sometimes with tragic consequences.
    The narratives in Samuel not only describe one crisis after another in Israel but
they reveal individual people in crisis, men and women like ourselves—Hannah,
Eli, Samuel, Saul, and David. Thus the books of Samuel deal with the same kind
of challenges that continue to face us some thirty centuries later: the challenge of
trusting versus distrusting God; the challenge of divine will versus human inclina-
tion; the challenge of human relationships and sometimes untamed emotions; the
challenge of spiritual leadership versus the prostitution of sacred office.
    First and Second Samuel appear as one book in the ancient Hebrew
manuscripts. Samuel could not have authored all of the book bearing his name,
because he died before the end of the first book. Yet the entire story stands as the
"lengthened shadow" of the prophet who established the prophetic office and be-
came the spiritual mentor of Israel's first two kings.
    Finally, the stories in this book reveal much about our God: His patience and
mercy in dealing with perverse human nature; His holy and righteous character,
which cannot and will not tolerate evil; His insistence on obedience from the heart
 resulting from a personal relationship with Him. He sought not mere outward or
formal compliance, but a faith that internalizes His law in the heart and
demonstrates it in the life, a faith that acknowledges sin, accepts forgiveness, and
 forsakes sin.
     It is that kind of faith in the face of change, crisis, and challenge that is so
 much needed in the lives of God's people today. These lessons have been written
 for our admonition to help us develop a deeper and stronger faith as we prepare
 for the final changes, crises, and challenges of this earth's history.

      God Hears the Prayer
            of Faith
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Samuel 1:1-3:21.

SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie
PM
      down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak,
      Lord; for thy servant heareth" (1 Samuel 3:9).

GOD CALLS PEOPLE to follow His purposes and plans. Because they
respond in different ways to His plans for them, the outcome of their lives
is different. God's way leads to His healing salvation; the way of the evil
one leads to destruction.

OUTLINE:
   I. A Mother's Faith (1 Sam. 1:1-2:10).
  11. A Father's Failure (1 Sam. 2:12-17, 22-36).
 I11. Samuel's Call (1 Sam. 2:11, 18-20; 3:1-21).

WHEN TIMES ARE TOUGH. The various ways in which people re-
spond to God's call are illustrated in this week's lesson by the experiences
of Hannah, Eli, Eli's sons, and Samuel. The choices made by these in-
dividuals had consequences that affected the lives of all Israel.
    The voices of Moses and Joshua had long since been silenced by death.
During the turbulent period of the judges (spanning some four centuries)
Israel was a loose-knit nation of tribal groups who found themselves facing
a world of political unrest and constant threat of invading enemies. Weak
leadership marked the era for the most part. Corruption in high places dis-
couraged the saints and disgusted the indifferent.
    Even more serious was the lack of prophetic revelation from God. "The
word of the Lord was rare in those days" (1 Sam. 3:1, NKJV). "Everyone
did what was right in his own eyes" (Judges 17:6, NKJV).
    In every era God wants to communicate with His people. Even in
times of greatest unrest and darkness He chooses men and women to shine
as lights for Him. This is as true in our age as it was in the time of Samuel.
We determine the effectiveness of our relationship with God, often lim-
iting its effectiveness by our faulty responses.
    The Lord called a humble but dedicated woman to give birth to and
train one of the greatest prophets and reformers in Israel's history. And He
called Eli to the exalted position of priest and pastor of His people. Eli's
response illustrates the weakness of human nature and demonstrates how
men whom God calls can thwart God's plans for them.

I. A MOTHER'S FAITH (1 Sam. 1:1-2:10).

1. Read the opening story in 1 Samuel 1:1-18. What can be learned
   from this introduction about the following?

  Elkanah and his family (vs. 2-5)

   Moral conditions in Israel (vs. 13, 14)

   Religious life in Israel (vs. 3-5)

   The name Elkanah means "God has redeemed" or "God has created."
Elkanah was a Levite and a descendant of Korah. (See 1 Chron. 6:16, 27,
33, 34.) Because he lived with his wives, Hannah and Peninnah, in the hill
country of Ephraim, he was called an Ephraimite. Elkanah, a Levite,
should have been serving at the Tabernacle in Shiloh, but "irregularities"
in the Eli family of priests made his service there unnecessary. (See Patri-
archs and Prophets, p. 569.) He must have been a man of influence, be-
cause only the wealthy could afford two wives. "The desire to perpetuate
his name led the husband—as it had led many others—to contract a second
marriage. But this step, prompted by a lack of faith in God, did not bring
happiness."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 569. (Compare Gen. 16:1-3.)
Disregard for God's ideal for marriage, for whatever reasons, can bring
only unhappiness and discontent. Peninnah, like Hagar, "bore herself with
pride and insolence."

2. How did Hannah respond to the constant harassment by her rival?
   What does this reveal about Hannah's character? 1 Sam. 1:10, 11.



   Prayer is a powerful weapon. Hannah must have been in the habit of
earnest supplication to God, but her request on this occasion was especially
urgent. Her appeal reached the ears of a loving heavenly Father. Her faith
had triumphed over despair!

3. What does Eli's response to Hannah's praying suggest regarding
   the social conditions in Israel at that time? 1 Sam. 1:12-16.



   "Feasting revelry had well-nigh supplanted true godliness among the
people of Israel. Instances of intemperance, even among women, were of
frequent occurrence, and now Eli determined to administer what he con-
sidered a deserved rebuke."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Corn-
mentary, vol. 2, p. 1008.

4. Using the chart on page 8, compare the similarities and contrasts
   between the birth and early childhood of Samuel with that of Sam-
   son, John the Baptist, and Jesus:

                                                                           7
          Lesson 1                                               January 5

            Samuel           Samson          John the Baptist       Jesus

          1 Sam. 1:20;   Judges 13:1-5,        Luke 1:5-7,       Luke 1:30-34;
            2:21, 26         24              13, 15, 66, 80        2:40, 52




MON   5. In what ways did Hannah show her faith after Samuel was born?
         1 Sam. 1:19-28.



         Hannah demonstrated her faith by the very name she gave her son:
      "Asked of the Lord," a name that would serve as a constant reminder to
      him of his dedication from birth. "I asked him for this child, and he gave
      me what I asked for. So I am dedicating him to the Lord. As long as he
      lives, he will belong to the Lord" (1 Sam. 1:27, 28, TEV).
         Imagine what mixed emotions must have surged through her mother
      heart as she brought Samuel to Shiloh to dedicate him to the Lord forever;
      joy at being able to bring such a beautiful gift to God, pain at having to
      part with her precious child, and apprehension at leaving him exposed to
      Eli's evil sons.

      6. Compare Hannah's song of thanksgiving at the birth of Samuel
         with the song of praise by another mother in Israel, centuries
         later. Luke 1:46-55.



         "The humble round of duties which women have come to regard as a
      wearisome task should be looked upon as a grand and noble work. It is the
      mother's privilege to bless the world by her influence, and in doing this
      she will bring joy to her own heart. She may make straight paths for the
      feet of her children, through sunshine and shadow, to the glorious heights
      above."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 572.

          Questions we should face. How do we react when the Lord requires us
      to wait for some good thing for which we have prayed? Do we cling by
      faith to Him even though our prayer is not answered in the way we desire?
      Do we remember the Lord when our petition is granted? What experience
      of answered prayer can you share with others?

      11. A FATHER'S FAILURE (1 Sam. 2:12-17, 22-36).

      7. List some of the regulations of the Levitical code that Eli's sons
         were violating. 1 Sam. 2:12-17. (Compare Lev. 7:23-36; Patriarchs
         and Prophets, p. 576.)
      8
       God Hears the Prayer of Faith                               January 5
        An understanding of God's holy nature and character was to be taught
     by the manner in which the priests carried out the services of the taber-
     nacle as given in the Levitical code, Israel's guidebook for worship. Every
     detail of the service portrayed some aspect of God's great plan of redemp-
     tion. Every violation of the sacred service marred its significance and
     weakened the message it conveyed, bringing contempt upon divine things.

111 8. Who had the greater responsibility for these sins, Eli's sons, or Eli
        himself? Why? 1 Sam. 2:22-29.



        Eli was a good man, but his weakness in not restraining his sons, and
     worse, in permitting them to continue serving as priests, brought disgrace
     to God's work for years to come. Eventually his family line ceased to func-
     tion as priests. However, the father's failure in no way excuses the sons.
     We each have individual responsiblity for our sins.

        The responsibility of parents and pastors. "We are just as re-
     sponsible for evils that we might have checked in others by exercise of
     parental or pastoral authority as if the acts had been our own. . . . The in-
     fluence of an ill-regulated family is widespread and disastrous to all
     society. It accumulates in a tide of evil that affects families, communities,
     and governments."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 578, 579.

     9. What spiritual truth did the unknown prophet remind Eli would
        be fulfilled regarding his family? 1 Sam. 2:30-36.



        " 'Those who honor me I will honor, but those who despise me will be
     disdained' " (1 Sam. 2:30, NIV) is no arbitrary judgment on God's part,
     but a great law of life. We reap what we sow. To despise God's order is to
     invite destruction. "Do not trifle with the sacred privileges of God's
     house! They will condemn where they do not uplift."—F. B. Meyer, Bible
     Commentary (Wheaton, Ill.: Tyndale House, 1984), p. 118.

        The responsibility of spiritual leadership is awesome. While we must
     remember that those in sacred office are fallible human beings with feet of
     clay like our own, yet the fact that they have been called by God to per-
     form His work places upon them great privilege and high accountability.
     How can the world believe the reality of the Christian message if it is not
     demonstrated in the lives of those who proclaim it?
        "Great as are the evils of parental unfaithfulness under any circum-
     stances, they are tenfold greater when they exist in the families of those ap-
     pointed as teachers of the people."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 579.

      10. God promised to raise up a faithful priest, one whom He could
          trust, one who would not disappoint the people or dishonor Him.
          Who fulfilled this prophecy? 1 Sam. 2:35 (compare 1 Sam. 3:19-
          21).
                                                                                 9
       Lesson 1                                                    January 5
         Of this prophecy, "some scholars think it refers to Zadok, . . . Others
      think it refers to Christ, and still others feel the prophecy is fulfilled in
      Samuel and his work. But the important lesson of this statement is to be
      found in the fact that man cannot prevent the final accomplishment of
      God's desire to restore His own image in the heart of man."—SDA Bible
      Commentary, vol. 2, p. 464.

         Ask yourself, Am I an Eli, in the home, the school, or the church? If so,
      how can I change so that my responsibilities will be fulfilled in the manner
      that God approves?

WED   I11. SAMUEL'S CALL (1 Sam. 2:11, 18-20; 3:1-21).

      11. What might have been some of Samuel's duties in his ministry as
          a boy priest? 1 Sam. 2:11, 18-20. (Compare 1 Sam. 3:15 and
          Patriarchs and Prophets pp. 573, 574.)



         The usual age for young men entering the priesthood was 25, but an ex-
      ception was made for Samuel. Early in life he began wearing the linen
      ephod as a token of his dedication to the service of God. But his duties
      matched his age and abilities: Opening the doors of the tabernacle every
      morning, emptying the ashes from the altar, trimming the golden lamp-
      stands. Whatever the duties, he performed them faithfully. All the while he
      was training for higher responsibilities. No duty is unimportant when done
      to the glory of God.

      12. Why was the word of the Lord rare in the days of the judges, the
          time into which Samuel was born? When will such circumstances
          be repeated? Judges 6:1; Amos 8:11, 12.



         The book of Judges reveals a dark and shocking period of Israel's his-
      tory. Shameful violence, gross immorality, brazen idolatry, and national
      apostasy pervaded the nation like a thick cloud. Samuel was to be the
      "morning star" of their reformation.

          God will not tolerate evil. Judgment must come, but before His judg-
      ments were to fall on the wicked sons of Eli He already was preparing a
      deliverer through whom His grace and His power to save would be re-
      vealed.

      13. Review the story of Samuel's call from the Lord by completing
          the following:

           When did the call come? 1 Sam. 3:2-4

           How did Samuel respond? 1 Sam. 3:5-8

      10
 God Hears the Prayer of Faith                               January 5
  Who interpreted the call of God to Samuel? 1 Sam. 3:9

    The seven golden lamps were to be kept burning constantly, and
trimmed every morning and evening. "Before dawn, while the lamp was
still burning" (1 Sam. 3:3, TEV) Samuel awakened to a voice calling his
name. Thinking that Eli had called him, Samuel hastened to his side. The
third time this happened Eli realized that the call was from God. He in-
structed Samuel how to answer. Because Samuel had never before had a
direct encounter with God, he needed the aged priest's affirmation that it
was indeed the voice of God that spoke to him.

   God's call confirmed by the church. The voice that called young
Samuel to the prophetic office was the same voice that later called Saul of
Tarsus on the road to Damascus. Saul's call then was confirmed by the
church through Ananias. (See Acts 9:10-15.) David, when called and
anointed by Samuel to be king over Israel, waited many years until the na-
tion confirmed that call with a coronation.
   Samuel answered God's call, but waited for God to lead him into the
fulfillment of the prophetic office.

14. If you had been in Samuel's place, how would you have re-
    sponded to the unpleasant task of revealing to your superior the
    message given by God (1 Sam. 3:11-18)?



   We are to give God's message faithfully. "As we see the fulfillment
of prophecy, our faith in the final triumph of Christ's kingdom should
strengthen; and we should go forth with renewed courage to do our ap-
pointed work.
   "The solemn, sacred message of warning must be proclaimed in the
most difficult fields and in the most sinful cities, in every place where the
light of the great threefold gospel message has not yet dawned."—Gospel
Workers, pp. 26, 27.

15. What does Eli's response to Samuel's message tell us about his
    attitude? Would it have been too late at this point for Eli or his
    sons to repent? 1 Sam. 3:18.



   "Eli did not manifest the fruits of true repentance. He confessed his
guilt, but failed to renounce the sin. Year after year the Lord delayed His
threatened judgments. Much might have been done in those years to re-
deem the failures of the past, but the aged priest took no effective measures
to correct the evils that were polluting the sanctuary of the Lord and lead-
ing thousands in Israel to ruin."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 582.

16. Though exposed to the same environment, Eli's sons chose op-
    posite paths to those Samuel chose. What factors made the dif-
    ference in Samuel's spiritual growth and development?
                                                               11
       Lesson 1                                                   January 5
     17. What do these words mean: "The Lord was with him and let
         none of his words fall to the ground" (1 Sam. 3:19, NKJV)?



        "As Samuel grew up, the Lord was with him, and made come true
     everything that Samuel said. So all the people of Israel, from one end of
     the country to the other, knew that Samuel was indeed a prophet of the
     Lord. The Lord continued to reveal himself at Shiloh, where he had ap-
     peared to Samuel and had spoken to him. And when Samuel spoke, all
     Israel listened" (1 Sam. 3:19-21, TEV).

     HOW DOES THIS APPLY TO ME? How do I respond to the call of
     God when He asks me to do something for Him? I can cooperate with the
     Lord and the church in fulfilling the divine call in the ways that follow:




     FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read "The Child Samuel"
MI able,
   and "Eli and His Sons" in Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 569-580. If avail-
         read the SDA Bible Commentary on 1 Samuel 1-3. Read the entire
     text for today's lesson in several modem translations if possible.

     SUMMARY: In the same way that God called Samuel to the prophetic of-
     fice, He calls each of us to fellowship with Himself and to service to His
     church and the world. When God calls me by name, am I ready to respond,
     "Speak, Lord, for Your servant hears"?

      Reverence for the Holy

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Samuel 4:1-7:14.

SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "And I will dwell among the children of Is-
 PM   rael, and will be their God. And they shall know that I am the
      Lord their God, that brought them forth out of the land of
      Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I am the Lord their God"
      (Exodus 29:45, 46).

RESPECT FOR GOD'S PRESENCE. We are blessed as we show love
and reverence for God in our homes, our schools, our hospitals, and our
churches. Israel and her enemies perverted the use of the visible symbols
of the divine Presence and thereby lost the blessing.

OUTLINE:
   I. Israel's Error (1 Sam. 4:1-22).
  11. The Philistine's Offense (1 Sam. 5:1-6:21).
 I11. From Defeat to Victory (1 Sam. 7:1-14).

SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ARK. Though the people of Israel "knew
that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord" (1 Sam. 3:20),
spiritual life in the nation was at a low ebb. The evil influence of Eli's sons
in the sanctuary at Shiloh had brought the sacred services into public con-
tempt. Even the neighboring nations, knowing of the scandal, became
bolder in their idolatry and crime. "But a day of retribution was approach-
ing. God's authority had been set aside, and His worship neglected and
despised, and it became necessary for Him to interpose, that the honor of
His name might be maintained.--Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 583.
   The ark of the covenant was the symbol of God's presence. It was
the focal point of the sanctuary services. God had given careful instruction
regarding the building and handling of this sacred chest. (See Ex. 25:10-
16.) But the people of Israel, their senses dulled by sin and influenced by
Eli's sons, had borrowed some of the pagan ideas of their idolatrous neigh-
bors. They regarded the ark as an object of worship. How God brought
them through tragedy, defeat, and finally to revival and victory is the sub-
ject we will study this week.

I. ISRAEL'S ERROR (1 Sam. 4:1-22).

1. Why was Israel defeated by the Philistines when they went out to
   battle against them (1 Sam. 4:1, 2)? Deut. 20:1-4 (compare 7:18-
   21).

14
 Reverence for the Holy                                    January 12
   "This expedition was undertaken by the Israelites without counsel from
God, without the concurrence of high priest or prophet."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, p. 583. God had promised to fight Israel's battles for her. He
knew that even at best the people would be no match for the powerful ene-
mies they would meet. At this point in time the tribes of Israel were a
loosely knit, poorly organized confederacy with virtually no equipment to
match the military might of their troublesome enemy. The Philistines, on
the other hand, were well organized, and superior in military know-how
and sheer numbers. Their monopoly of the use of iron weapons and their
four-wheeled wooden ox-carts made them a formidable enemy.
   To their credit, the elders of Israel recognized that their disastrous
defeat was the result of not allowing the Lord to guide them. In trying to
make amends they made matters worse by calling for the ark to be taken
into battle with them.

2. On what basis did the Israelites make this decision? 1 Sam. 4:3-6
   (compare Joshua 6:1-16). What fallacy prompted this action?
   1 Sam. 4:7, 8.



   The only record of the ark accompanying the Israelites to battle was
under the leadership of Joshua in the taking of Jericho. At that time, they
did so under the specific supervision and instruction of God.
   Possibly the Philistines' fish god, Dagon, accompanied the wily ene-
mies of Israel to the battlefront. Perhaps the influence of such pagan cus-
toms led the Israelites to believe that the ark would somehow ensure God's
presence with them. The elders decided to take the ark into battle without
securing divine permission.

   The Israelites' presumption. "They did not consider that it was the
law of God which alone gave to the ark its sacredness, and that its presence
would bring them prosperity only as they obeyed that law. . . .
   "The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, eagerly acceded to the pro-
posal to bear the ark into the camp. Without the consent of the high priest,
they ventured presumptuously into the holy of holies, and took from thence
the ark of God. Filled with pride, and elated with the expectation of speedy
victory, they bore it to the camp. And the people, beholding, as they
thought, the token of Jehovah's presence, 'shouted with a great shout, so
that the earth rang again.' "—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 2, p. 1011.

3. Under what circumstances was the Lord enthroned above the ark
   of the covenant? Ex. 25:8, 21, 22; 29:45, 46.



   Israelites, like their enemies, had come to look upon the ark as a kind of
good-luck charm, if not a god. The ark was sacred because, when it was
placed in the Most Holy apartment of the sanctuary, it was the place where
the person of God was manifested. Nature testifies to God's glory, but na-
                                                                          15
     Lesson 2                                               January 12
ture is not God. So the ark testified to God's presence in the sanctuary, but
the ark was not God. This great truth distinguished Israel's God and
Israel's religion from false gods and false religions.

4. What lessons can we learn from the tragic events that followed?
   1 Sam. 4:9-21.



   "The most terrifying calamity that could occur had befallen Israel. . . .
The wife of Phinehas, notwithstanding the impiety of her husband, was a
woman who feared the Lord. . . . She felt that the last hope of Israel was
gone; and she named the child born in this hour of adversity, Ichabod, or
`inglorious': . . . 'The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark of God is
taken.' "—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 584, 585.

   What is true reverence? Israel assumed that God was with them be-
cause they honored the symbol of His presence. In what ways do we some-
times make the same mistake?

11. THE PHILISTINES' OFFENSE (1 Sam. 5:1-6:21).

5. Read 1 Samuel 5 for the account of the Philistines' experience with
   the sacred ark. Note how God cared for the ark and, despite the
   failure of His people, defended His own honor:

     Verse 3

     Verse 4

     Verse 6

     Verse 9

     Verses 11, 12

   An opportunity lost. Think of the missionary impact this experience
could have had on the idolatrous Philistines. Notice the advice of the
priests and diviners who suggested they "give glory unto the God of
Israel" (1 Sam. 6:5).

6.    What might have happened if the Philistines had been sincere in
      this acknowledgement of the true God? 1 Sam. 6:1-12.



   "These wise men acknowledged a mysterious power accompanying the
ark. . . . Yet they did not counsel the people to turn from their idolatry to
serve the Lord. They still hated the God of Israel, though compelled by
overwhelming judgments to submit to His authority."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, p. 587.
16
        Reverence for the Holy                                   January 12
iii   7. Why were the Israelites of Beth-shemesh not better prepared than
         the Philistines to have the ark among them? 1 Sam. 6:13-21.



         Notice the reasons pointed out in Patriarchs and Prophets, page 589:
         • The worshipers failed to repent of their sins.
         • They were not faithfully obeying God's law.
         • They looked at the return of the ark as a harbinger of good, but had
      no true sense of its sacredness.
         • Instead of finding a suitable place for it, they left it in the harvest
      field where it had arrived.
         • They became familiar with it, then curious to see its contents, and fi-
      nally emboldened to remove the sacred coverings. Only the high priest was
      permitted to behold the ark, and that once a year. (See Heb. 9:7; Lev. 16:2,
      29-31.) Even the Philistines had not dared to open it. The Israelites' sin
      was a daring violation of God's command to honor the ark with reverence
      and awe.

         What are the results of irreverence in the church today? What does
      Israel's experience teach us regarding the sacredness of the symbols of
      God's presence? How would you suggest that irreverence in God's
      house should be corrected?

       I11. FROM DEFEAT TO VICTORY (1 Sam. 7:1-14).

       8. Where did the ark finally find a safe resting place? 1 Sam. 7:1, 2.



          Apparently the people of Beth-shemesh, including the Levites among
       them, did not repent of their sin, but appealed to the men of Kirjath-jearim
       to take the ark. "With solemn gladness they brought it to their city and
       placed it in the house of Abinadab, a Levite. This man appointed his son
       Eleazar to take charge of it, and it remained there for many years."—
       Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 589.
          Archeological evidence supports the idea that Shiloh most likely was
       destroyed by the Philistines during the battle of Aphek. There is no more
       mention of it in the book of Samuel. (See Ps. 78:60-64.) Nob became the
       home of the sanctuary during the reign of Saul. (See 1 Sam. 22:19.) The
       ark remained in the house of Abinadab for twenty years until the time of
       David's reign.

WED     9. What was it likely that Samuel was doing during the twenty-year
           period after Israel's terrible defeat? What relationship existed
           between Israel and the Philistines? 1 Sam. 7:3.



         Samuel must have carried a heavy burden on his heart for his wayward
       people. Imagine him walking the dusty roads of his country, from village
                                                                             17
  Lesson 2                                                   January 12
to village, from home to home, pleading for the people to return to God,
warning them, and praying with and for them.
   While there evidently was no deportation of Israelites to Philistia, they
were subject to the Philistines, paying tribute, and serving them in various
ways. Social and business relationships brought them into constant contact
with Philistines. While the Israelites hated being in bondage to them, they
came to love their ways, accepting their customs, their gods, and their
evils.
   The strange gods they adopted included the female deity, Ashtaroth, who
was the consort of both the Philistine fish god, Dagon, and the Canaanite
Baal. "Her worship usually consisted of lewd orgies, fostered many times
by leading women who became her devotees and were known as 'sacred
women,' or temple prostitutes."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2, p. 480.

10. When the Israelites began to turn their hearts to the Lord, what
    course did Samuel specify that they must take as evidence of their
    repentance? 1 Sam. 7:3, 4.



     The psalmist declared: "With my whole heart I have sought You; Oh,
let me not wander from Your commandments!" "I have inclined my heart
to perform Your statutes" (Ps. 119:10, 112, NKJV). Seeking God with the
whole heart involves turning to Him in obedience to His commands, re-
penting of sins, and turning away from habits, attitudes, idols, or whatever
separates us from Him. This leads to genuine revival.
    "He who searches the heart, desires to win His people from every spe-
cies of idolatry. . . . 0 that you would search your hearts as with a lighted
candle, and discover and break the finest thread that binds you to worldly
habits, which divert the mind from God."—Selected Messages, book 2, p.
318.

11. Compare Samuel's appeal to the people to "return unto the Lord.
    with all your hearts," with the following: 1 Kings 8:46-50; Isa.
    55:6, 7. What do these references tell us about our God?



   "All the paternal love which has come down from generation to genera-
tion through the channel of human hearts, all the springs of tenderness
which have opened in the souls of men, are but as a tiny rill to the bound-
less ocean when compared with the infinite, exhaustless love of God.
Tongue cannot utter it; pen cannot portray it. . . . Eternity itself can never
fully reveal it."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 740.
   "There is need today of such a revival of true heart religion as was ex-
perienced by ancient Israel."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 590.

12. What was the Philistines' reaction to Israel's revival? 1 Sam. 7:5-
    7. Do you see any parallels in this experience to that of
    our church today? Rev. 12:10-12.

18
 Reverence for the Holy                                     January 12
   "The lords of the Philistines recognized this to be tantamount to a dec-
laration of independence, . . . The Philistines attacked with such speed that
the Israelites, assembled from various parts of the country with peaceful
intentions, were compelled to meet them, unprepared for warfare. The only
way out was through prayer."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2, p. 482.
   The enemy of our souls is not too concerned about us as long as he
thinks he has us in his grip. But when revival comes to us and he sees we
are in earnest about breaking our ties with him, he attacks speedily and
fiercely.

13. Compare Israel's response to the Philistine threat this time with
    their reaction 20 years earlier. Compare the results of this battle
    with the earlier one. What made the difference? 1 Sam. 7:8-10;
    1 Sam. 4:1-3.



   What a change from the overconfident, self-reliant people of twenty
years earlier, now humbled and totally surrendered to the Lord, plead-
ing, " 'Do not cease to cry out to the Lord our God for us' " (1 Sam.
7:8, NKJV). What a difference the prophet's prayers made! How easily
God defeated their enemies when they relied on Him to fight their
battles for them! "For nations as well as for individuals, the path of
obedience to God is the path of safety and happiness."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, p. 591.

14. How did Israel celebrate God's intervention in their behalf?
    What were the long-range results of their victory? 1 Sam. 7:12-
    14.



   " 'Hitherto hath the Lord helped us,' and He will help us to the end.
1 Samuel 7:12. Let us look to the monumental pillars, reminders of what
the Lord has done to comfort us and to save us from the hand of the de-

has shown us, . . . thus strengthening ourselves for all that is before us

WHERE IS MY ALLEGIANCE? Do I place more emphasis on the
symbols of religion than on the presence of God in my life? Check the
suggestions below which you consider to be the best solutions to this prob-
lem.
         Do away with religious symbols, such as churches, religious art
and music, the communion service, baptism.
         Invent new religious symbols that will be more spiritually mean-
ingful to me.
          Constantly remind myself that religious symbols have no real sig-
nificance apart from the spiritual relationship with God that they represent.
          Invite Christ to come into my heart, to take over the direction of
my life, and trust Him for guidance and protection.

      FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read "The Ark Taken by
ua the Philistines" in Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 581-591. Study a good
   map of ancient Palestine to become familiar with the places of today's les-
      son and the topography of the land. If you have a Bible dictionary, look up
      further information on the Philistines.

      SUMMARY: God entrusted His people Israel with the sacred ark of the
      covenant, containing His holy law. He revealed His presence above the
      ark, where He made known His will. But when Israel treated the ark as a
      god instead of a symbol of His presence, and when they regarded it as
      commonplace, He withdrew His favor. When we engage in religious ac-
      tivities and enter into worship services without the presence of Christ in
      our hearts, we expose ourselves to the same risk of spiritual and eternal
      loss that many experienced in ancient Israel.

      God's Rule or Human
             Rule?

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Samuel 7:15-8:22.

SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "And the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken
 PM   unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for
      they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I
      should not reign over them" (1 Samuel 8:7).

IGNORING DIVINE GUIDANCE HAS TRAGIC CONSEQUEN-
CES. When God's people ignore His counsel and insist on having their
own way, the Lord sometimes acknowledges their choice, obliging them to
live with the consequences.

OUTLINE:
   I. Samuel's Ministry; Schools of the Prophets (1 Sam. 7:15-17).
  11. "We Want a King" (1 Sam. 8:1-9).
 I11. Dangers of a Monarchy (1 Sam. 8:9-22).

PROPHETS SPEAK FOR GOD. From earliest Bible times God chose
men and women to speak for Him. Abraham was called a prophet.
(See Gen. 20:7.) Moses enjoyed a relationship with God that went beyond
that of prophets in general. (See Num. 12:6-8.) Samuel's ministry marked
a new era. He was the first to establish the prophetic office. As founder
and president of the schools of the prophets, he trained young men to assist
him in his teaching ministry and in shepherding his people Israel.
   What a disappointment to him, then, to find the people dissatisfied with
the system of prophet-judge under the kingship of God! They clamored for
a king, so that they might be "like the other nations." Samuel knew that
the entire future history of Israel was at stake in this decision.
   God treats His children as intelligent, rational creatures. He warns them
of dangers and appeals for them to accept His plans, but then He allows
them freedom of choice. This understanding of God's dealing with humans
is well illustrated in today's lesson.

I. SAMUEL'S MINISTRY; SCHOOLS OF THE PROPHETS
   (1 Sam. 7:15-17).

1. What three major offices did Samuel hold as leader of God's
   people? 1 Sam. 3:20; 7:9, 15-17.
                                                            21
       Lesson 3                                                    January 19
        Samuel's work and ministry marked a transition period in Israel's his-
     tory. He was the last of the judges, and the first of the official prophets. He
     also served as a Levitical priest in the absence of the sanctuary services,
     which had been discontinued with the destruction of the tabernacle at
     Shiloh. God used Samuel to set up a new form of government at this per-
     ilous time in Israel's history.

si   2. What other important work occupied Samuel's energies? 1 Sam.
        19:20.



         Samuel was the founder and president of the schools of the prophets.
     (See Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 593, 663.) He gathered companies of
     dedicated young men, known as "sons of the prophets," to these schools
     to train them as leaders and teachers of the oracles of God. The term Nai-
     oth in Ramah (1 Sam. 19:18, 19) refers to "a place 'in Ramah,' where
     Samuel and the 'sons of the prophets' dwelt, and where David stayed for
     some time while hiding from Saul (1 Sa 19:18, 19, 22, 23; 20:1). Some
     have suggested that the Hebrew term may mean 'dwelling,' in the sense of
     a 'dormitory' in which prophets lived."—SDA Bible Dictionary, revised
     edition, p. 776.
         The schools of the prophets were located at Ramah and Kirjath-jearim.
     Later under the ministry of Elijah and Elisha there were others at Jericho,
     Bethel, and Gilgal.

        "The 'sons of the prophets' were not necessarily direct recipients of
     the prophetic gift, but were divinely called, as are gospel ministers today,
     to instruct the people in the will and ways of God. The schools of the
     prophets were a powerful force to restrain the tide of evil that often
     threatened to submerge the Hebrew people in a flood of idolatry, material-
     ism, and injustice, and provided a barrier against the fast-spreading wave
     of corruption."—SDA Bible Dictionary, revised edition, p. 903.

     3. Study the following facts about the schools of the prophets as out-
        lined by Ellen White, and supported by other Bible scholars. (See
        Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 592-602.) Do you see any parallels to
        the pattern God has given His modern-day church for education?

        Purpose of the schools:
        a. To supplement the educational process provided by the home and
     parents, especially for those who desired to search deeper into spiritual
     truth.
        b. To serve as a barrier against widespread corruption.
        c. To provide for the moral and spiritual welfare of youth.
        d. To promote the future prosperity of the nation by "furnishing it with
     men qualified to act in the fear of God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 593.

          Course of Study:
          a. The law of God as given through Moses.
          b. Sacred history.
     22
       God's Rule or Human Rule?                                   January 19
         c. Sacred music and poetry.
         d. Practical training in the vocations such as tilling the soil and me-
      chanical skills.
         e. The cultivation of personal piety and devotion.

          Learning was experiential, not merely academic. "A spirit of devo-
      tion was cherished. Not only were students taught the duty of prayer, but
      they were taught how to pray, how to approach their Creator, how to exer-
      cise faith in Him, and how to understand and obey the teachings of His
      Spirit. Sanctified intellects brought forth from the treasure house of God
      things new and old, and the Spirit of God was manifested in prophecy and
      sacred song."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 594.

         What major differences do you see between the kind of education
      given in the schools of the prophets and that usually given in schools
      and colleges today? Where are your children being trained? Why is
      Christian education so important?

MON   11. "WE WANT A KING" (1 Sam. 8:1-9).

      4. What specific circumstances prompted the elders in Israel to ask
         Samuel to give them a king? 1 Sam. 8:1-5.



         "It was with the full assent of the nation that Samuel had appointed his
      sons to office; but they did not prove themselves worthy of their father's
      choice. . . . The sons of the prophet had not heeded the precepts which he
      had sought to impress upon their minds. . . . The warning given to Eli had
      not exerted the influence upon the mind of Samuel that it should have
      done. He had been to some extent too indulgent with his sons, and the re-
      sult was apparent in their character and life. . . . Had the evil course of his
      sons been known to him, he would have removed them without delay; but
      this was not what the petitioners desired."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p.
      604.

      5. What was the real reason for Israel's wanting a king? 1 Sam. 8:20.



         This was not the first time Israel had thought of having a king. In the
      days of the judges, some of the men of Israel tried to make Gideon their
      king. (See Judges 8:22, 23.) Later the men of Shechem made Abimelech,
      Gideon's son, their king for a time. (See Judges 9:1-6.)
         Israel's government during the period of the judges was a rather loose-
      knit confederacy of the twelve tribes. Politically, it was a time of turmoil
      when Israel was often subject to defeat. The judgeship system seemed to
      have failed. The arguments of the elders for combining the tribes into a
      monarchy for stronger military defense, and for continuity of leadership
      sounded logical from a human viewpoint.
         The real issue was not in Israel's system of government but in her
                                                                                  23
 Lesson 3                                                    January 19
failure to obey God's laws. The future history of Israel and Judah would
prove all too tragically that a monarchy would be no more effective than
the spirituality and integrity of the king on the throne.
   The elders seemed to forget that if the priest's sons could be vile, and
the prophet's sons dishonest, the king's sons might also be corrupt.
Moreover, in a monarchy it would be most difficult to change leaders.

6. What was Samuel's response to this request? What did he do?
   1 Sam. 8:6.



   What would you have done? Put yourself in Samuel's place. Try to
imagine your own emotional reaction to this situation. Have you ever been
in a similar circumstance? How did you react? Did you remember to pray?

   The Real Problem. "Samuel saw that their real motive was discontent
and pride, and that their demand was the result of a deliberate and deter-
mined purpose. No complaint had been made against Samuel. All
acknowledged the integrity and wisdom of his administration; but the aged
prophet looked upon the request as a censure upon himself, and a direct ef-
fort to set him aside. He did not, however, reveal his feelings; he uttered no
reproach, but carried the matter to the Lord in prayer, and sought counsel
from Him alone."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 604, 605.

7. What was God's response? 1 Sam. 8:7. Read the texts below and
   list other instances in Israel's history when God agreed to let His
   people have their own way, even though it was not in their best in-
   terest.

     Num. 11:4-6, 18-20, 31-34

     Num. 13:30-33; 14:22-24

   God said, in effect, "Don't feel bad, Samuel; this is the way they've
been treating Me 'since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even
unto this day' " (1 Sam. 8:8).
   "How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved
him in the desert! Again and again they tried God's patience and provoked
the Holy One of Israel" (Ps. 78:40, 41, NEB).

   What have been the results in your life when God has allowed you
to have your own way regarding something that you knew in your
heart was not His will for you?

I11. DANGERS OF A MONARCHY (1 Sam. 8:9-22).

8. Before giving the people their request, what warning was Samuel
   instructed to deliver? 1 Sam. 8:9-18.

       God's Rule or Human Rule?                                 January 19
      9. Contrast the excuses Israel gave for wanting a king with the warn-
         ings God gave against having one:


        Why Israel Wanted a King:            Why God Said It Was Not Best:
        1 Sam. 8:5, 20.                      1 Sam. 8:11-17


        Discontent with Samuel's sons.       Misuse of power over subjects.
        Wanted to be like the nations.       King would demand best
        (Compare Lev. 18:2-4.)               resources to enrich himself.
        Wanted a king to judge them.         High taxes to support a
        (Compare Deut. 17:8-13.)             monarchy.

        Wanted a king to fight their         Conscription to military would
        battles. (Compare Deut. 20:4;        take their sons. Oppression
        7:18-21; 9:3.)                       of the people was likely. God
                                             promised to fight for them.

      10. Study the following examples of the fulfillment of these predic-
          tions in the reigns of some of the kings of Israel and Judah:
        • High taxes: 1 Kings 10:25.
        • Service for the king: 1 Kings 10:25, 26.
        • Best of the land: 1 Kings 21:1-16.
        • Oppression of the people: 1 Kings 12:1-14.
        • Military conscription: 1 Chron. 21:1-4, 7.

WED   11. What lay at the root of Israel's problem throughout history?
          What lessons can I learn for myself and my church? Compare
          Deut. 1:30-32; Ps. 78:17, 22.


         Israel's failure to trust God in simple belief is seen by the psalmist as
      rebellion. Their insistence on a king was an outright refusal to trust God's
      promises of deliverance from their enemies.

      12. God foresaw that Israel would want a king. What guidelines did
          He give to Moses in the event that happened? Deut. 17:14-20.


         "Though a monarchical form of government for Israel had been fore-
      told in prophecy, God had reserved to Himself the right to choose their
      king."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 608.

      13. In the chart below rate the first three kings of Israel on the
          specific guidelines given in Deuteronomy 17:14-20, with an (A)
                                                                      25
  Lesson 3                                                    January 19
      for "according to God's will," (F) for "failure," and (C) for "ac-
      ceptable." (Study the texts listed below the chart.)

     King to be chosen by God, v. 15

     He must be an Israelite, v. 15
     He must not enrich himself at
     expense of subjects, nor enslave
     them, vs. 16, 17
     He must not multiply wives, v. 17

     He must rule by law of God,
      vs. 18-20


   Saul: 1 Sam. 9:15-17; 9:2; 15:9; 2 Sam. 3:7; 1 Sam. 14:24; 15:23.
   David: 1 Sam. 16:1; 5:13; 8:15; 24:17; 7:25-27.
   Solomon: 1 Chron. 28:5; 29:1; 1 Kings 10:14, 26-29; 11:1-4;
4:26, 27; 9:22; 11:9-11.
   Although Israel wanted a king "that they might be like the other na-
tions," their true King wanted to spare them the tyranny, serfdom, and cor-
ruption that often came with this form of government. Through Moses,
God had given restrictions and sound principles that, if followed, might
avoid the pitfalls of an authoritarian state. Sadly, His counsel was more
often ignored than followed by Israel's future kings. The Israelites had
chosen to reject God as their King. Instead of His divine assistance, they
would now be subject to the hereditary succession of a line of kings that
would often bring apostasy and disgrace to the nation.
14. After hearing of the dangers of a monarchy, how did the people
    respond? 1 Sam. 8:19, 20. What lessons for the church today can
    we learn from Israel's experience?



     "The Israelites did not realize that to be in this respect unlike other na-
tions was a special privilege and blessing. God had separated the Israelites
from every other people, to make them His own peculiar treasure. But
they, disregarding this high honor, eagerly desired to imitate the example
of the heathen! And still the longing to conform to worldly practices and
customs exists among the professed people of God. As they depart from
the Lord, they become ambitious for the gains and honors of the world.
. . . For the sake of earthly distinction they sacrifice the unspeakable honor
to which God has called them."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 607.

26
 God's Rule or Human Rule?                                 January 19
15. Sometime later, when the people admitted to their sin in asking
    for a king, what appeal did they make to Samuel? 1 Sam. 12:19.



   In many ways Samuel was a type of Christ. The people had despised his
"humble authority," even as centuries later the Jewish nation would reject
the humble Man of Galilee as their king, choosing Barabbas instead.
   Perhaps the quality of Samuel's leadership that shines out the brightest
is his intercession for his people. On several occasions the people came
crying to him with the plea "Pray for us." Dedicated as he was to their
spiritual welfare, he assured them in words that should burn into every
leader's heart: "God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to
pray for you" (1 Sam. 12:23; compare Heb. 7:25).

16. What precious assurance did Samuel give the people at this time?
    1 Sam. 12:22. What lesson does this teach us about the kind of
    God we serve?



THE MODERN PARALLEL. List some areas of our personal lives and
our church life in which we tend to make choices similar to those of the
Israelites in demanding a king to rule over them:

   • Personal choices:



   • Choices by the church:



   • What should we do to correct the situation?



FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read the chapter, "The
Schools of the Prophets" in Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 592-602.

SUMMARY: Samuel's dedicated ministry to Israel, and to the schools of
the prophets, provides models for our church today. The story of Israel's
rejection of God's system of government, their insistence on having a king,
and their unbelief stand as warnings to us today. (See 1 Cor. 10:11.)

January 20-26


         God Chooses the
       Leaders of His People
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Samuel 9:1-12:25.

SAB     MEMORY TEXT: "For the Lord will not forsake his people for
PM      his great name's sake: because it hath pleased the Lord to make
        you his people" (1 Samuel 12:22).

LEADERS CHOSEN AND TESTED. In every era of history, God has
chosen faithful leaders for His people. Their success or failure has always
depended upon their willingness to follow His leading.

OUTLINE:
   I. Saul Chosen to Be King (1 Sam. 9:1-27).
  11. Saul Anointed King (1 Sam. 10:1-16).
 I11.. The Coronation of Saul (1 Sam. 10:17-27).
 IV. Israel's New King (1 Sam. 11:1-13).
  V. The Kingdom Confirmed (1 Sam. 11:14-12:25).

GOD SELECTS A KING. God consented to let Israel have a king. But
through the prophet Samuel He definitely controlled the choice. The narra-
tive makes clear that Saul did not aspire to be king, nor had the people
chosen him. God handpicked an unknown young man from the small tribe
of Benjamin. Samuel surprised Saul by anointing him king, after which
Saul won the respect of the people in his first battle encounter. Samuel re-
assured the Israelites that God always would teach and guide them if they
would remain faithful to Him.
   The pertinent message for us is that, even when His people diverge
from His will, God is directly involved in their affairs. He appoints leaders
to revive their spirits, refurbish their waning spiritual energies, and direct
them to the divine Source of their wisdom and strength. Humanity may
fail, but God never does. There is a divine hand guiding the affairs of His
church, a merciful Providence hovering over faulty believers, a loving God
tenderly implementing His infinite purpose for the salvation of lost human-
ity.

I. SAUL CHOSEN TO BE KING (1 Sam. 9:1-27).

1. Read the story of Saul and his father's donkeys in 1 Samuel 9:1-
   14. Comment on the following:

     Saul's background (v. 1)
28
       God Chooses the Leaders of His People January 26

        Saul's appearance (v. 2)

        Saul's occupation (v. 3)

         Saul's servant (vs. 5-8)

         "The personal qualities of the future monarch were such as to gratify
      that pride of heart which prompted the desire for a king. . . . Of noble and
      dignified bearing, in the prime of life, comely and tall, he appeared like
      one born to command."— Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 608.

      2. What significance does this detailed account (1 Sam. 9:1-14) have
         for the story about Israel's wanting a king?



         Saul is introduced in the narrative as a man looking for his father's
      asses. These animals would become symbols of royalty in Israel. Instead of
      finding the animals Saul found the prophet. Or did the prophet find him?
      God had agreed to give His people a king, but He remained in control of
      the selection process. Saul had no political experience, no aspirations to be
      a leader, but God recognized that he fitted the description of what Israel
      wanted in a king—strong physical prowess and attractive appearance.
      Moreover, at this stage Saul was susceptible to divine conviction and lead-
      ing.
         The Philistines were a tall, strong people. Could that have influenced
      the Israelites' desire for a leader such as Saul? (See 1 Sam. 9:16, 17.)

      3. Reconstruct in your own words the story of the meeting between
         Saul and Samuel. 1 Sam. 9:18-10:1. Note especially what God said
         to Samuel when he saw Saul for the first time. 1 Sam. 9:17.



         • What would be your thoughts if you had been Samuel, knowing that
      you were handing over your leadership to an unknown, inexperienced
      man?
         • How would you have felt had you been Saul, facing an uncharted
      course, and perhaps a dangerous task as military leader against the wily
      Philistines?
         • What situations can you think of in the church today that may be
      similar to the situation in which Samuel and Saul found themselves?

MON   11. SAUL ANOINTED KING (1 Sam. 10:1-16).

      4. What was the significance of the secret anointing of Saul? 1 Sam.
         10:1-8?



                                                                                 29
 Lesson 4                                                   January 26
   "At this stage it was a private and indeed secret action; Samuel took
care to be unobserved by others (9:27), and Saul did not even tell his
closest relatives what had happened [ 1 Sam. 10:16]. . . . In other words, it
was a symbolic act, making him king in God's sight but not yet in the na-
tion's. (It is possible that the word translated prince in verse 1 means
`king-designate,' king to be.')."—David F. Payne, I & II Samuel
(Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1982), p. 50.

5. What evidence was seen at this time that God had called Saul to
   be the first king of Israel? 1 Sam. 10:9-13.



   Imagine how this train of events must have affected Saul! The ruddy
outdoor man, accustomed to farms and farm animals, now faced with the
responsibility of leading a nation, joined the "sons of the prophets" in
singing praises to God. (The Hebrew word translated "prophesy" may
mean "to act as a spokesman for God.") -
   The use of music for the praise and worship of God was considered part
of the prophetic gift. David's musicians are said to have prophesied with
harps, psaltries, cymbals, and their voices. (See 1 Chron. 25:1-6.)

   Saul spiritually transformed. No wonder the people marveled at the
dramatic change that had come about in Saul. "God gave him another
heart" (1 Sam. 10:9). When the Spirit of God comes upon His willing,
believing people, their lives are transformed. They respond with thanksgiv-
ing and demonstrate an earnest desire to follow God's leading. This ex-
perience of spiritual renewal must be fostered daily by prayer, Bible study,
and submission to the Lord's will.

   How would you describe the change in your life when you first ac-
cepted Christ as your Saviour? What differences do you see in your
spiritual experience now? Does Revelation 2:4 apply to you? If so, how
can you regain the inspiration of your early relationship with Christ?

I11. THE CORONATION OF SAUL (1 Sam. 10:17-27).

6. What mixed reactions surfaced among the people at Saul's corona-
   tion at Mizpah? What was Saul's reaction? 1 Sam. 10:21-24, 27.



   "While the people in general were ready to acknowledge Saul as their
king, there was a large party in opposition. For a monarch to be chosen
from Benjamin, the smallest of the tribes of Israel—and that to the neglect
of both Judah and Ephraim, the largest and most powerful—was a slight
which they could not brook. . . . Those who had been most urgent in their
demand for a king were the very ones that refused to accept with gratitude
the man of God's appointment. . . . In this condition of affairs Saul did not
see fit to assume the royal dignity."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 611,
612.
30

El 7. What did Samuel do to ensure that the new monarchy would
       operate according to God's plan? 1 Sam. 10:25. Review some of
       the guidelines that might have been included in this document.
       Deut. 17:14-20.



        "From the very start, as verse 25 shows, the monarchy was constitu-
     tional: the kings would have both rights and duties. We might see in the
     document mentioned here a sort of bill of rights for the people, held in the
     very safe keeping of a sanctuary (that is the meaning of the phrase before
     the Lord). Here was an important brake upon the development of absolute
     power. Strictly speaking, rights and duties is used to translate a single
     word (mishpat) in Hebrew, which in other contexts might mean 'custom'
     or 'ways,' as in 8:11. Such a document must however have been a legal
     one, not a mere description of the ways which kings are prone to act; so
     `regulations' (NIV) is probably the nearest English equivalent to mish-
     pat."—David F. Payne, / & // Samuel, p. 53.

        What is your reaction when someone is appointed to a position in
     the church that you think he or she is not qualified to fill? Is it possible
     that, in some circumstances, like Saul's opponents, you are opposing
     an appointment made by God?

     IV. ISRAEL'S NEW KING (1 Sam. 11:1-13).

     8. Following a time of apparent inactivity on the part of the new
        king, what crisis provided Saul an opportunity to assert his leader-
        ship role? 1 Sam. 11:1-11.



         Jabesh-gilead, a small city in northern Transjordan, was suddenly be-
     sieged by the Ammonites, who felt confident of help from more powerful
     tribes. Not far away was the Philistine fortress city of Beth-shean.
         Acting quickly, and exerting his new royal mandate, Saul mustered an
     army, descended on the Ammonites, and put them to flight.

     9. After the stunning victory given by God at Jabesh-gilead, some of
        the people wanted revenge on Saul's detractors. What was Saul's
        response, and what does it tell us about his character at the begin-
        ning of his reign? 1 Sam. 11:12, 13.



        "Here Saul gave evidence of the change that had taken place in his
     character. Instead of taking honor to himself, he gave the glory to God. In-
     stead of showing a desire for revenge, he manifested a spirit of compassion
     and forgiveness. This is unmistakable evidence that the grace of God
     dwells in the heart."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 613.

                                                                               31
       Lesson 4                                                 January 26
WED   10. To whom did Saul give credit for the victory in this battle?
          1 Sam. 11:13.



          If only Saul could have maintained the generous and forgiving spirit
      that was evident on this occasion! If only he could have continued to rec-
      ognize that victory comes from the Lord! How differently the story of the
      first king of Israel might have ended! Indeed, how different the history of
      the nation might have been!

         In our battles with spiritual enemies, why is it always important to
      give God the credit for victory? What happens when we take the glory
      to ourselves? (See Rom. 4:1-5; Eph. 2:8-10.)

      V. THE KINGDOM CONFIRMED (1 Sam. 11:14-12:25).

      11. Gilgal had been the scene of many special and sacred moments
          in Israel's history. Now Samuel called Israel once again to this
          place. Why was it necessary to renew the kingdom at this time?
          1 Sam. 11:14, 15; 12:1, 2.



           To this place, so fragrant with memories of God's miraculous deal-
      ings, Samuel called the children of Israel to renew the kingdom. Here,
      without doubt, he rehearsed in their ears the loving watchcare and the
      long-suffering patience of a heavenly Father during the past centuries. It
      would have been far better had they been satisfied with God's original plan
      of government, but inasmuch as they desired a king, God promised to be-
      stow His Spirit upon the new king as He had upon the judges. Though they
      had rejected Him they had abundant witness that God would still be with
      them. By establishing a line of succession on the basis of heredity, Israel
      was throwing the doors open for many problems and dangers they had not
      encountered under the judges. But through Samuel, God affirmed His ever-
      lasting love and devotion, and promised to surround them with the same
      solicitous protection that had been theirs in centuries past."—SDA Bible
      Commentary, vol. 2, p. 501.

      12. Summarize briefly the main points Samuel made in his farewell
          speech as Israel's leader. 1 Sam. 12:1-13.

           Verses 1-5

           Verses 6-11

           Verses 12, 13

      13. Compare Samuel's appeal to Israel with that of another great
          leader of God's people in his final address: 1 Sam. 12:14, 15;
          Deut. 28:1, 15.
      32
 God Chooses the Leaders of His People January 26
   Again and again Moses had appealed to Israel to obey and live. Disobe-
dience would result in tragic consequences. The history of God's people
had demonstrated the truth of Moses' words. Yet they were slow to learn.
Now they had sinned again in asking for a king. Samuel reminded them
that their only safety would be in serving and obeying the Lord. Samuel
was calling the people of Israel to covenant renewal as they began a new
era in their national life.

14. Describe the dramatic event that brought the people of Israel to
    realize their sin in asking for a king. 1 Sam. 12:16-19.



   Thunder and rain at the time of wheat harvest (late May and early June)
would be almost unheard of in Palestine. Imagine then, the fear that
gripped the people as they realized the truth of Samuel's words. Suddenly
their sin loomed before them. They confessed their pride and rebellion
against God's will in asking for a king. They begged the prophet for
mercy. This action by Israel shows how deficient was their concept of
God. They failed to recognize His loving goodwill toward them.

15. Study Samuel's words to Israel, noting the promises and comparing
    their New Testament counterparts. 1 Sam. 12:22, 23.

   "The Lord will not forsake his people." Compare Heb. 13:5, 6.

   "The Lord . . . [has made] you His people." Compare 1 Peter 2:9, 10.

   I will not cease "to pray for you." Compare Col. 1:9-11; Rom. 8:26.

   "I will teach you the good and the right way." Compare Acts 20:20,
27; John 16:13.

   Although Samuel forcefully convinced the people of their sin, he ended
his address with a message of hope and courage. His promise not to cease
to pray for the people was a reminder to them that whatever course their
kings might take, they would still have prophets to give them spiritual
guidance, and to pray for them. (Compare Daniel 9:3-19.)
   He reminded them again that what God really wanted more than any-
thing else was for them to serve Him with all their hearts. He sought for
them the New Covenant promise: "I will put my laws into their mind,
and write them in their hearts" (Heb. 8:10). Finally, he asked the people
to consider what "great things He has done for you" (1 Sam. 12:24,
NKJV).

    What hath God wrought! "In reviewing our past history, having
traveled over every step of advance to our present standing, I can say,
Praise God! As I see what God has wrought, I am filled with astonishment,
and with confidence in Christ as leader. We have nothing to fear for the fu-
ture except as we shall forget the way the Lord has led us."—Testimonies
to Ministers, p. 31.
                                                                         33

WHAT DOES THIS LESSON MEAN TO ME?
   • Review some of the great things God has done in the history of His
remnant church. How can these events of the past give us courage to meet
the challenges we face today?
   • Are there areas in my life where I find myself rebelling against God's
expressed will?
   • How do I respond to being replaced or rejected in favor of someone
who seems less qualified than I am for a job or position?
   • What can Samuel's example teach me?
   • How would my life change if I were to spend some time each day re-
counting the blessings of God and the great things He has done for me?

FURTHER STUDY: Read the chapter entitled "The First King of
Israel," in Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 603-615.
   Read Psalms 78, 105, 106. Inspiration suggests that these psalms, that
depict God's great patience and love for His people in spite of their rebel-
lion and failures, should be read and studied often by modern-day Israel.
(See Testimonies to Ministers, p. 98.)

SUMMARY: God loved His people Israel. Even when they rebelled
against Him and chose their own way instead of His will for them, He con-
tinued to care for them and worked out His purposes of love toward them.
Along with His warnings of danger and reprimands for wrong courses of
action He sent messages of assurance and guidance through His prophet.

       The Road to Rebellion

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Samuel 13:1-15:35.

SAB     MEMORY TEXT: "And Samuel said, Hath the Lord as great
 PM     delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice
        of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to
        hearken than the fat of rams" (1 Samuel 15:22).

REBELLION AND RUIN ARE PRECEDED BY EXCUSES. The road
to rebellion is paved with excuses, rationalizations, and so-called "respect-
able" sins, but it ends in disaster and ruin. In this week's lesson we see
Saul turn his feet down that tragic road.

OUTLINE:
   I. Saul's First Mistake (1 Sam. 13:1-14).
  11. When Pride Prevails (1 Sam. 13:15-14:46).
 I11. False Piety Becomes Rebellion (1 Sam. 14:47-15:35).

A CRISIS IN LEADERSHIP. Ancient Israel was as much a church as it
was a nation. The union of church and state worked well as long as the
people acknowledged God as their ultimate ruler. The divine plan was that
human judges and prophets in Israel should function as administrators
under specific directions given by God. When the Israelites demanded a
king, they were warned that such a ruler would tend to exercise absolute
power, ignoring dependence upon God's control and direction.
   This lesson demonstrates what happened when the king chose to act
contrary to God's will. As you study ask yourself: Why was the concept of
absolute kingship out of harmony with a theocratic form of government
(rule by God)? Because God chose Saul to be king and removed him when
he failed to follow divine directions, what kind of kingship did He ob-
viously have in mind for Israel? From the perspective of the present-day
church, what message for church leaders everywhere is contained in this
week's lesson? What message does the lesson have for most church mem-
bers?

I. SAUL'S FIRST MISTAKE (1 Sam. 13:1-14).

   Saul's victory at Jabesh-gilead raised the morale of Israel and gave him
prestige to rally the people around him to meet the wily Philistines. It is a
wonder that they had not attacked Israel sooner.
   Saul divided his men into two companies and sent the rest home. "Here
was a serious error. His army was filled with hope and courage by the re-
                                                                           35

      cent victory; and had he proceeded at once against other enemies of Israel,
      a telling blow might have been struck for the liberties of the nation."—
      Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 616.

      1. What event precipitated the meeting at Gilgal? 1 Sam. 13:2-4.



         This is our first introduction to Jonathan, the brave and daring son of
      Saul. In the second year of Saul's reign Jonathan attacked and defeated the
      garrison at Geba.

      2. In view of these circumstances how did the following people
         react? 1 Sam. 13:5-9, 12.

           The Philistines (v. 5)

           The Israelites (vs. 6, 7)

           Saul (vs. 8, 9, 12)

        This was the "last straw" of rebellion by these impudent Israelites! The
      NEB reads: "The name of Israel stank" (1 Sam. 13:4). The Philistines
      mustered their forces and prepared for the attack.

      3. What was the purpose of the meeting at Gilgal? What previous in-
         structions had Samuel given? 1 Sam. 13:8, 9; 10:8.



         Seeing the panic of his followers, Saul felt desperately in need of God's
      blessing and guidance. Earlier Samuel had instructed him to wait a week
      before acting. But because Saul had not prepared his forces, they now
      began to desert him.

         Human plans substituted for God's. "Before the time appointed by
      the prophet had fully expired, he became impatient at the delay and al-
      lowed himself to be discouraged by the trying circumstances that sur-
      rounded him. Instead of faithfully seeking to prepare the people for the
      service that Samuel was coming to perform, he indulged in unbelief and
      foreboding. . . . God required that His people should search their hearts and
      repent of their sins, that the offering might be made with acceptance before
      Him, and that His blessing might attend their efforts to conquer the enemy.
      But Saul had grown restless; and the people, instead of trusting in God for
      help, were looking to the king whom they had chosen, to lead and direct
      them."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 617.

MON   4. Samuel's delay in meeting Saul's army at Gilgal was a testing and
         proving time for Saul. What negative character traits are exhibited
         in the following actions or statements recorded in 1 Samuel 13?

      36
 The Road to Rebellion                                       February 2
  Saul went out to meet and greet Samuel (v. 10)

  "You did not come within the days appointed" (v. 11, NKJV)



   "I have not made supplication to the Lord" (v. 12, NKJV)



   "I forced myself" (v. 12)

   I "offered a burnt offering" (v. 12)

   One of the most serious of all sins is disobedience dressed in the garb
of piety. "What he [Saul] lacked in real piety he would try to make up by
his zeal in the forms of religion."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 622. To
usurp the role of priest in order to impress his fainting followers, to ignore
the plain requirements of God regarding the sacred services, was the height
of presumption. Saul disqualified himself as Israel's leader.

   Obey God irrespective of circumstances. "There is no safety except
in strict obedience to the word of God. All His promises are made upon
condition of faith and obedience, and a failure to comply with His com-
mands cuts off the fulfillment to us of the rich provisions of the Scriptures.
We should not follow impulse, nor rely on the judgment of men; we should
look to the revealed will of God and walk according to His definite com-
mandment, no matter what circumstances may surround us."—Patriarchs
and Prophets, pp. 621, 622.

5. What solemn message did Samuel deliver to Saul at this time?
   1 Sam. 13:13, 14.



   Israel must be reminded that their monarchy was under the direct rule of
their God. As long as they remained subordinate to His will they would
prosper and God would be their defense. Had Saul shown a spirit of humil-
ity and a desire to be obedient, his kingdom might have been established
forever.

   Be strictly honest with yourself. Have you suffered disappointment
and loss because you have disobeyed God's commands? "All we like
sheep have gone astray" (Isa. 53:6). Complete forgiveness and acceptance
are available when we confess and repent. (See Isa. 55:7.)

11. WHEN PRIDE PREVAILS (1 Sam. 13:15-14:46).

6. Note the description and explanation of Israel's status in relation-
   ship to their enemies, the Philistines. 1 Sam. 13:19-21. (If possible,
   read these verses in some of the newer translations.)
                                                                      37
 Lesson 5                                                  February 2
   The Philistines, or "Sea Peoples," came from Caphtor (Crete), ac-
cording to Jeremiah 47:4 and Amos 9:7. Their unchallenged control of
the coastal plains, their thorough acquaintance with military techniques,
and their monopoly of iron weapons made them a formidable enemy to
Israel.
   This rather dismal picture makes Jonathan's victory described in
1 Samuel 14 shine all the brighter.
   The obscure reading of 1 Samuel 13:21 in the King James Version has
puzzled many. But excavations at Lachish and other places have revealed
that the word pim (translated "file" in KJV) was actually the weight of 2/3
of a shekel. The RSV reads: "and the charge was a pim for the plowshares
and for the mattocks, and a third of a shekel for sharpening the axes and
for setting the goads."

7. Read the account of Jonathan's daring in 1 Samuel 14:1-14. (Con-
   sult one of the newer translations, if possible.) What does this
   story suggest about the following characters?

     Saul (v. 2)

     Jonathan (vs. 6, 12, 13)

     His armorbearer (vs. 7, 13)

   "Josephus thinks that it was at break of day that Jonathan and his
armor-bearer approached the Philistine outpost, and reached it when most
of the men were yet asleep (Antiquities vi. 6. 2). The narrative of ch. 14
confirms the idea that it was early morning (see vs. 15, 16, 20, 23, 24-28,
30, 31, 45). Whether the two Israelites waited till night to make the ascent
or whether it took them but a few minutes to climb the precipice is not
stated. They evidently took the fortress completely by surprise, for the ut-
most confusion reigned in the Philistine garrison."—SDA Bible Commen-
tary, vol. 2, p. 515.

8. What rather extreme ultimatum did Saul issue and what were the
   results? 1 Sam. 14:24, 31-33.



   At best, Saul's motive for this rash command would be a kind of mis-
placed piety to ensure God's continued favor. Because he was the
commander-in-chief of his army, it was his duty to see that his troops were
supplied with food and supplies. Instead, the curse he pronounced led to
weakness and confusion, and finally to his soldiers' desperate violation of
one of God's plain commands. (See Lev. 3:17.)

9. Describe Jonathan's response to his father's course of action.
   1 Sam. 14:29, 30.



38
       The Road to Rebellion                                         February 2
         "The military achievement of Saul's men would have been a great task
      for a well-fed army, and was much greater for an ill-fed throng of undis-
      ciplined country folk such as he led. What a lesson this experience could
      have been to Saul, still smarting under rebuke, and jealous only for his
      own reputation. But once he had set foot in the quicksand of pride, each
      feeble and indecisive attempt to extricate himself only caused him to sink
      deeper."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2, p. 517.
         Obviously, God did not approve of Saul's oath, for He refused to an-
      swer him (1 Sam. 14:37). Certainly God would not approve Saul's intent
      to kill Jonathan after He had so miraculously worked through him to rout
      the enemy.

      10. Review the conversation between Saul and Jonathan, and the
          people's intervention to save Jonathan. 1 Sam. 14:43-45. What
          does this incident reveal about Jonathan's character?



         What modern applications do you see? How do people today some-
      times substitute oaths and strict demands for genuine commitment to
      Christ?

WED   I11. FALSE PIETY BECOMES REBELLION (1 Sam. 14:47-15:35).

         The last part of 1 Samuel 14 lists Saul's achievements, the names of his
      family members, and his commander-in-chief. These facts usually are pre-
      sented at the end of the account of a given king. It is as though the narra-
      tor is suggesting that this is the end of the reign of Israel's first king before
      launching into the sad story of Saul's last chance. Once more the prophet
      Samuel came to the king with instructions from the Lord. Once more Saul
      was given an opportunity to prove his ability to lead Israel according to
      God's direction.

      11. Who were the Amalekites? Why was the severe command given
          to destroy them? 1 Sam. 15:1-3 (compare Ex. 17:8-16; Deut.
          25:17-19).



         The Hebrew word used in verse 3 for "utterly destroy" actually means
      "to put under ban," that is, to consecrate to the Deity by destruction. This
      was a sacred command to exterminate a whole people and all their belong-
      ings. Israel was a tool in God's hand to bring judgment on the wicked
      Amalekites just as later other nations were used by God to bring a less
      severe judgment on Israel.

         Why God punishes. "The forbearance that God has exercised toward
      the wicked, emboldens men in transgression; but their punishment will be
      none the less certain and terrible for being long delayed. . . . While He does
      not delight in vengeance, He will execute judgment upon the transgressors
      of His law. He is forced to do this, to preserve the inhabitants of the earth
                                                                                    39
  Lesson 5                                                  February 2
from utter depravity and ruin. In order to save some, He must cut off those
who have become hardened in sin."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 628.

12. What message did God give Samuel? How did he respond?
    1 Sam. 15:11.



   The NKJV reads "I greatly regret." The TEV says, "I am sorry." God
does not repent in the sense that humans do, but "God's repentance im-
plies a change of circumstances and relations."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
p. 630.
   The NEB says that "Samuel was angry," and the NASB, "Samuel was
distressed." No doubt his "[crying] out to the Lord all night" involved a
combination of anger, disappointment, frustration, and grief.

13. In the following verses find the actions or statements of Saul that
    demonstrate some of his sins and weaknesses. 1 Sam. 15:12, 13,
    15, 20, 21.




14. Study prayerfully Samuel's oft-quoted message to Saul in
    1 Samuel 15:22, 23. Compare:

     Isa. 1:11-17

     Micah 6:6-8

    God is displeased when people piously go through forms and ceremo-
nies, thinking that He will be appeased by their goodness, when all the
while their hearts are far from Him and their lives demonstrate disobe-
dience and presumption instead of faith. The ancient sacrifices were given
to lead people to God, not to be a substitute for a relationship with Him. So
today, mere profession, going through the motions of religion without a
saving relationship with Christ, is unacceptable to God.
    Andrew Blackwood once said: "The man whose religion comes by
proxy finds in it no refuge from the storms of life."

15. Saul immediately confessed his sin. What indicates that
    his repentance was motivated by fear of consequences? 1 Sam.
    15:24-30.



   "Saul had manifested great zeal in suppressing idolatry and witchcraft;
yet in his disobedience to the divine command he had been actuated by the
same spirit of opposition to God and had been as really inspired by Satan
as are those who practice sorcery; and when reproved, he had added stub-
40
       The Road to Rebellion                                    February 2
     bornness to rebellion. He could have offered no greater insult to the Spirit
     of God had he openly united with idolaters."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
     p. 635.

     DO YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE?
        • I am still acceptable to God when I commit little acts of disobe-
     dience. Agree         Disagree
        • Because Christ saves me by grace alone, I do not have to be con-
     cerned about strict conformity to His law. Agree    Disagree
        • Obedience to the commands of an earthly leader is always a sign of
     obedience to God's will. Agree         Disagree
        • Spiritual enemies can be overcome only by total dependence on
     God's will and power. Agree         Disagree

     FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read "The Presumption of
ua ets,
   Saul" and "Saul Rejected," chapters 60 and 61 in Patriarchs and Proph-
        pp. 616-636.

     SUMMARY: The road to rebellion begins with seemingly respectable
     sins—putting our ways above God's ways, rationalizing that our pet sins
     are not really so bad. But gradually and insidiously, presumption leads to
     disobedience, pride confirms willfulness, eventually leading to rebellion
     and ruin. These warnings are "written for our admonition, upon whom the
     ends of the world are come" (1 Cor. 10:11).

          How God Prepares a
               Leader
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Samuel 16:1-20:42; 23:16-18.

SAB     MEMORY TEXT: "Then said David to the Philistine, Thou
PM      comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield:
        but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of
        the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied" (1 Samuel 17:45).

THE SCHOOL OF CHALLENGE AND HARDSHIP. God trains the
leaders of His people by subjecting them to trial and difficulty. The road
from obscurity to usefulness for God is often paved with obstacles and
challenges that fashion the character after the similitude of the divine.

OUTLINE:
   I. David Anointed as Israel's Future King (1 Sam. 16:1-23).
  11. David's Courage Based on Faith (1 Sam. 17:1-58).
 HI. David's Humility and Saul's Jealousy (1 Sam. 18:5-19:24).
 IV. The Covenant Between David and Jonathan (1 Sam. 18:1-4;
      20:1-42; 23:16-18).

OLD-COVENANT FAILURE; NEW-COVENANT VICTORY. In the
same way that Israel under the old covenant could not obey by mere
human will, Saul had shown the futility of human effort without divine
power. In the same way that the new covenant provided divine power,
David would illustrate what God can do through regenerated human nature
filled with His Spirit.
    In this week's lesson we get a first glimpse into the life of the beloved
and charming young David. We see him in his relationship to his own
family, to the family of King Saul, to his people Israel, and especially to
the Lord. He was to be the regal forebear of the Son of God. We are awed
as we see bravery in meeting the giant Goliath, and are touched by his
humility and his love for Jonathan.

I. DAVID ANOINTED AS ISRAEL'S FUTURE KING (1 Sam. 16:1-
   23).

1. Read the story of the instruction to Samuel to anoint a son of Jesse
   as Israel's new king. 1 Sam. 16:1-13. Comment on the following:

     Samuel's fear (v. 2)

42
       How God Prepares a Leader                                   February 9
        The people of Bethlehem (v. 4)
        The secrecy of the occasion (vs. 3-5)

        Samuel's impression of Jesse's sons (vs. 6-10)
        God's method of choosing a king (v. 7)
         David's anointing and the results (v. 13)
         In choosing the first king of Israel, God had given the people what they
      wanted, a man whose physical bearing and appearance appealed to their
      expectations.
         Now, in a rather dramatic scenario, God demonstrates to the prophet
      Samuel that " 'the Lord does not see as man sees; for man looks at the out-
      ward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart' " (1 Sam. 16:7, NKJV).
         God looks for character. "No outward beauty can recommend the
      soul to God. The wisdom and excellence revealed in the character and de-
      portment, express the true beauty of the man; and it is the inner worth, the
      excellency of the heart, that determines our acceptance with the Lord of
      hosts. How deeply should we feel this truth in the judgment of ourselves
      and others."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 638.

      2. What chain of events led to David's training in the king's palace in
         preparation for his future work? 1 Sam. 16:14-23.


         David's training was divided between the palace and the pasture. In
      Saul's presence he would learn the ways of royalty. He would be exposed
      to the responsibilities and the liabilities of leadership. But the most impor-
      tant aspect of David's education as Israel's future king was in nature's
      classroom amid the rocky cliffs of the Judean hills. (Compare 1 Sam.
      17:15.) His preparation to be Israel's future shepherd would be earned
      caring for his father's flocks.
          There with his harp (actually a lyre), under the inspiration of the Holy
      Spirit, David composed music that would minister to the sick king, and
      wrote many of the immortal lyrics that would bless God's people for ages
      to come.

        What more recent examples can you give of the special preparation
      God has provided for people whom He has chosen as leaders?

MON   11. DAVID'S COURAGE BASED ON FAITH (1 Sam. 17:1-58).

      3. Read the story recorded in 1 Samuel 17:1-11 of Israel's encounter
         with the Philistines. Indicate your answers to the following:
        • Why did the Philistines challenge Israel with one man instead of a
      whole army?
                                                                            43
 Lesson 6                                                   February 9
     • Why was this such a serious challenge? (v. 9)



4. Compare the reaction of Saul and his men with David's assess-
   ment of the situation. 1 Sam. 17:11, 24, 26.



   "What a contrast—a humble shepherd lad encouraging an experienced
and successful warrior of Israel! Saul, the only giant of Israel (ch. 10:23),
realized that he should have been the one to accept Goliath's challenge.
But a guilty conscience left him fearful and trembling. . . . David, on the
other hand, radiated that spirit of genuine optimism and courage that is the
badge of 'a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men'
(Acts 24:16; cf. Ps. 51:10,11). David was as courageous as Saul was
cowardly."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2, p. 538.

5. Why did David's brothers react with such intense jealousy to his
   offer to fight Goliath? 1 Sam. 17:28. What was Saul's reaction?
   verses 31-37.



    The secret of David's strength was not so much that he had killed a lion
and a bear as a shepherd lad, but that he had developed courage, fortitude,
and a living faith in his God. Now, at his father's request, he had come to
the battlefront, and under the direction of an angel of God he sought to ful-
fill a mission.
    "His spirit was stirred within him. He was fired with zeal to preserve
the honor of the living God." Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 645.
    His brothers' jealousies and suspicions must have been aroused from
the day that Samuel visited their home and chose David from among them.
Now, condemned by his youthful courage and daring, and by their own
cowardice, they responded in anger to his offer.

6. How does David's challenge to Goliath show that his purpose was
   not to demonstrate his own prowess and bravery? 1 Sam. 17:45-
   47. What great spiritual truth did David believe and illustrate by
   these words?



   The dramatic story of David's victory over Goliath, loved by children
everywhere, is more than a story of courage and daring. It is the story of
faith; faith that has not been dimmed by doubt, discouragement, and
despair; faith that has not been eroded by the tunnel vision of seeing things
through mere human perspective; faith that relies on God to do the im-
possible.
   This model for Christian living reminds us that the Goliath giants in our
lives need not intimidate us into icy fear. It teaches us what David under-
44
 How God Prepares a Leader                                   February 9
stood so well—that the battle belongs to the Lord of hosts. It is not by
sword or spear, but by God's power that we shall gain the victory. And it
is not for our credit or glory, but "that all the earth may know that there is
a God in Israel" (1 Sam. 17:46).

   By what means may we conquer the spiritual giants that threaten to
destroy our relationship with Christ? (See 1 John 5:4, 5.)

I11. DAVID'S HUMILITY AND SAUL'S JEALOUSY (1 Sam. 18:5-
     19:24).

7. What factors made Saul jealous of David? 1 Sam. 18:5-9, 14-16.



   "The demon of jealousy entered the heart of the king. He was angry be-
cause David was exalted above himself in the song of the women of Israel.
In place of subduing these envious feelings, he displayed the weakness of
his character. . . .
   "One great defect in the character of Saul was his love of approbation.
This trait had a controlling influence over his actions and thoughts; every-
thing was marked by his desire for praise and self-exaltation. His standard
of right and wrong was the low standard of popular applause. No man is
safe who lives that he may please men, and does not seek first for the ap-
probation of God. It was the ambition of Saul to be first in the estimation
of men. . . .
   "Saul opened his heart to the spirit of jealousy by which his soul was
poisoned."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 650.

8. Describe Saul's first two attempts against David's life. 1 Sam.
   18:10, 11, 17. By what duplicity did Saul show his insincerity
   toward David? Verse 17-27.



   When Saul was anointed as king the Spirit of the Lord came upon him,
and he became a new man (1 Sam. 10:6, 9). When David was anointed
"the Spirit of the Lord came upon . . . [him] from that day forward"
(1 Sam. 16:13). But at the same time "the Spirit of the Lord departed from
Saul, and a distressing spirit from the Lord troubled him" (v. 14, NKJV).
The Bible writers often ascribe to God what He permits. As Saul rejected
the pleadings of the Spirit and the warnings of the prophet, he opened the
door of his mind to the natural consequences—a disturbed mind, which
Satan could now easily control.

   Inner sin destroys. Saul could lead an army against his enemies, but he
could not control his worst enemy—himself! With his passions out of con-
trol, and his judgment impaired, he would plunge from a frenzy of rage
into the depths of despondency and depression.

9. Why was Saul afraid of David? 1 Sam. 18:28-30.
                                                                            45
       Lesson 6                                                    February 9
         David's very presence condemned the guilty king. God's favor upon the
      blameless life and character of David reproached his own miserable and
      envious nature. "Envy is the offspring of pride, and if it is entertained in
      the heart, it will lead to hatred, and eventually to revenge and murder."—
      Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 651.

WED   10. What factors account for David's friendship with Jonathan? Sug-
          gest several reasons why they might have been natural enemies.
          1 Sam. 19:1-5 (compare 14:29; 17:57-18:1).



          Jonathan had already displayed an unusual spirit on several previous oc-
      casions. Perhaps he saw what was happening to his father and determined
      not to follow in his footsteps. But for whatever reasons, Jonathan, in a truly
      unselfish spirit, defended David, his rival for the throne. David, on the
      other hand, must have possessed a charm combined with a spirit of humil-
      ity that endeared him to the crown prince.

      11. Review the next two attempts by Saul to kill David, and the res-
          cue by his wife. 1 Sam. 19:8-17. What does Psalm 59, which well
          may have been written on this occasion, indicate about David's
          attitude?



         Seeing Saul was intent on taking his life, David now fled to Naioth
      in Ramah, hoping for protection, or possibly counsel from the prophet
      Samuel. The rather strange events that followed (see 1 Sam. 19:20-24),
      have puzzled many. David Payne's comments on the incident are
      helpful:
         "Experience must never be allowed to replace or displace a sincere
      desire to understand and to obey God's will, revealed to us in the Scrip-
      tures. . . .
         "In Saul's case, it is easy to interpret his experience at Naioth as just
      part of his growing psychological disturbance. . . . He went to Naioth of his
      own free choice, in pursuit of an innocent man; if God there took away his
      self-control, it was not to harm Saul but to rescue David."—David F.
      Payne, / & II Samuel, pp. 102, 103.

         What testimony could you give to God's intervention for you, pro-
      viding protection from spiritual and physical enemies?

      IV. THE COVENANT BETWEEN DAVID AND JONATHAN
          (1 Sam. 18:1-4; 20:1-42; 23:16-18).

      12. Study the Bible ideals for true friendship indicated in the texts
          below. List some of the qualities that must have been present in
          David and Jonathan's friendship.

           John 15:13
      46
      How God Prepares a Leader                                   February 9
         Job 2:11

         Prov. 17:17

         Prov. 27:10

     13. By what significant act did Jonathan pledge his loyalty to David?
         1 Sam. 18:4.



ii 14. After Saul's repeated attempts on his life, where did David next
          turn for help? What was Jonathan's response and proposal?
          How did Saul react? 1 Sam. 20:1-13, 27-34.



        David now left Samuel and returned to Jonathan for help. He was con-
     vinced that "there is but a step between me and death" (1 Sam. 20:3). Yet
     Jonathan was willing to risk all in order to help his friend. Indeed it almost
     cost him his life.
        Though distressed by his father's bizarre behavior, he was always loyal
     to him. Now Saul in a fit of frenzy tried to kill his own son (1 Sam. 20:30-
     34). His narrow, selfish spirit could not comprehend his son's unselfish-
     ness in willingly conceding his right to the throne to another.

     15. What were the terms of the covenant between the two friends?
         1 Sam. 20:8, 14-17, 42.

         David's obligation:

         Jonathan's vow:

        The covenant between David and Jonathan was a covenant of friend-
     ship, based on love and loyalty. But it also had political implications, for it
     bound David's house for all time to be kind to Jonathan's posterity. (See
     2 Sam. 9:1, 7.) Their parting words to one another sealed their vow. (See
     1 Sam. 20:42.) David never forgot his obligation to his friend. And
     Jonathan's loyal friendship, by God's providence, preserved the life of
     Israel's future leader.
        Such loyalty is rare in these days of self-serving. It reminds us of our
     "elder Brother" willingly giving up His position, His royalty, to save His
     brothers and sisters in the human family.

      16. Describe the last meeting between Jonathan and David. By what
          assurance did Jonathan once more show his unselfish character?
          1 Sam. 23:16-18.



        Jonathan encouraged David. Such faith surely must have been born of
                                                                                 47
  Lesson 6                                                    February 9
more than mere human friendship. The ties of their friendship were deeply
rooted in mutual trust in the God of Israel. (See Patriarchs and Prophets,
p. 660.)
   Ellen White states that after the encouraging visit of Jonathan, David
sang (or possibly composed) the eleventh psalm. (Read Psalm 11.)

NEEDS IN MY LIFE:
   Do any of the following describe my personal needs at this time?
   • I need to be more sensitive to seeing people the way God sees them,
realizing that God measures others by inner qualities rather than by mere
outward appearance.
   • Sometimes I seem overly concerned with superficial qualities about
myself while neglecting the inner spiritual qualities.
   • I have allowed giants of discouragement, doubt, and despair (or other
negative feelings), to keep me from living a victorious life in Christ. I often
forget that Christ is the only one who can win my battles.
   • There are certain circumstances in my life just now that have bred
jealousy and envy of another person. These attitudes have robbed me of
peace of mind and spiritual growth.
   • I desperately need a close friendship in my life, but I am afraid of
giving myself completely because it will make me too vulnerable. I am
afraid of being hurt.

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read "The Anointing of
David" and "David a Fugitive" in Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 637-659.
Read the following psalms of David and suggest which occasions or cir-
cumstances in today's lesson they might fit: Psalms 23, 27, 37.

SUMMARY: The rejection of the Spirit of God leaves a person vulnera-
ble to the evils of pride, jealousy, and envy. But those who allow His Spirit
to control their lives will manifest the beautiful fruits of love, loyalty,
humility, and unselfishness. Trusting in God, not in themselves, will
enable them to face life courageously, knowing that it is the Lord who
fights their battles for them.

  A Hunted Fugitive and a
        Mad King
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Samuel 21:1-23:28; 25:1-42.

SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.
PM    In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will
      not fear what flesh can do unto me" (Psalm 56:3, 4).

DAVID'S PREPARATION FOR THE THRONE took place in a gruel-
ing school of adversity. Sometimes he rose above adversity; at other times
he failed miserably. His years as a hunted fugitive reveal both his ad-
mirable strengths and his glaring inconsistencies. Yet he continued to trust
God, while Saul plunged deeper into despair.

DAVID'S DILEMMA. Where to now? David had not found refuge with
the prophet Samuel. His secret visit with Jonathan had confirmed his worst
fears; Saul was determined to kill him. Nor was he safe in his own home.
Security evaded him. He became a fugitive. Like a hunted deer, he fled
from one place to another.
   Under stress he made some serious mistakes, yet he never gave up his
hold on God. Providence used a godly woman to save him from a tragic
mistake that could have cost him the throne. Some of his most poignant
psalms were written during this dark period of his life.

I. DAVID'S FAITH WAVERS (1 Sam. 21:1-15).

1. What was David's reason for fleeing to the sanctuary at Nob? To
   what strategy did David resort to convince the priest of his needs?
   1 Sam. 21:1-5, 8; compare Matt. 12:3, 4.



   According to Leviticus 24:8, 9 the shewbread removed from the
sacred table every Sabbath was to be eaten by the priests. Up to this
point David's record had been flawless. Faced with the violent fury of
                                                                    49
  Lesson 7                                               February 16
Saul and the pain of separation from his family and beloved friend
Jonathan, David resorted to deception and duplicity. He who had so gal-
lantly taken the sword from Goliath, while trusting God to win the
battle, now wanted that same sword to defend himself.
   Jesus did not condone David's deception, but He defended the action of
the priest in giving shewbread to hungry men. In doing this Ahimelech
broke no moral law. God placed human need above the commands of the
ceremonial law. In the same way, Jesus placed the physical needs of His
disciples above the man-made laws that forbade them to pluck ears of
grain on the Sabbath day.

2. Review the incident at Gath, David's second mistake. 1 Sam.
   21:10-15. David wrote Psalm 34 as a result of this sad and embar-
   rassing experience. What lessons that David might have learned
   are suggested in this Psalm?

     Verse 4

     Verses 9, 10

     Verses 13, 14

     Verses 17-19

     Verse 22

    "He believed in God, he went in His name. But as he had been hunted
and persecuted, perplexity and distress had nearly hidden his heavenly
Father from his sight.
   "Yet this experience was serving to teach David wisdom; for it led him
to realize his weakness and the necessity of constant dependence upon
God. Oh, how precious is the sweet influence of the Spirit of God as it
comes to depressed or despairing souls, encouraging the fainthearted,
strengthening the feeble, and imparting courage and help to the tried serv-
ants of the Lord! Oh, what a God is ours, who deals gently with the erring
and manifests His patience and tenderness in adversity, and when we are
overwhelmed with some great sorrow!"—Patriarchs and Prophets, p.
657.

   Why is it never necessary to resort to dishonesty as a means of pro-
tecting ourselves? If God was able to protect David from Goliath,
could He not as easily have sheltered him from Saul?

11. TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES (1 Sam. 22:6-23).

3. How did Saul learn of David's visit to the priest at Nob? 1 Sam.
   21:7; 22:6-10.



4. What false accusations did Saul make to Ahimelech the priest?
50
       A Hunted Fugitive and a Mad King                        February 16
        1 Sam. 22:11-13. How did Ahimelech defend himself? Verses 14,
        15.


         David's dishonest report to Ahimelech resulted in tragedy for the high
      priest and his assistant priests. "Had the facts been plainly stated,
      Ahimelech would have known what course to pursue to preserve his life.
      God requires that truthfulness shall mark His people, even in the greatest
      peril."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 656.

MON   5. Who was ordered to carry out the king's violent command, when
         the guards refused? What were the consequences? 1 Sam. 22:17-
         19. What was David's response when he learned of the tragedy?
         Verse 22. Read David's description of Doeg the Edomite in Psalm
         52.


         Not much is known concerning Nob. It was the place where the taber-
      nacle was located after the destruction of Shiloh. The terrible massacre of
      the priests and the city's inhabitants probably ended the sacred services
      there, thus paving the way for Jerusalem to become the home of the ark
      and the tabernacle.

         Are you willing to admit the dire consequences of your sin as David
      did? This was a major difference between David and Saul. God forgives
      and overrules our mistakes when we are willing to confess and repent.
      Like David, sometimes we must live repentantly with the consequences.
      HI. DAVID A FUGITIVE (1 Sam. 22:1-5; 23:1-28).
      6. Following the incident at Gath, where did David go next? Whom
         did he take with him? What does this account tell us about Da-
         vid's family relationships? 1 Sam. 22:1-5.



         In a sense David was now a desperado. Finding refuge in the Judean
      wilderness, he was joined by others who wanted to escape the oppressive
      ruler and form a small kingdom of their own.
         The caring spirit of David for his parents says much about his character.
      Evidently the jealousy of his brothers in earlier days had given way to ac-
      ceptance and support, as they realized that David was to be the next ruler
      in Israel. Perhaps the words of Psalm 133:1 were inspired during this time:
      "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in
      unity!" (See Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 658.)
          In his distress at being a fugitive, David cried out, "How long, 0 Lord?
      Will You forget me forever? How long will You hide Your face from me?
      How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily?
      How long will my enemy be exalted over me?" (Ps. 13:1, 2, NKJV).
                                                                                51
 Lesson 7                                                 February 16
     He looked forward to the time when the Lord would say, " 'I will arise,
. . . I will set him in the safety for which he yearns' " (Ps. 12:5, NKJV).
   The Psalms of Lament. A substantial number of the psalms, known as
laments, are prayers of complaint and supplication. Some of David's
psalms identify the circumstances or occasion when they were composed.
Many of them were no doubt written during this time of his life, when he
was a fugitive fleeing from a mad king.
   The structure of a lament usually follows a general pattern of (a) ad-
dressing God with a cry for help, (b) the complaint, (c) a confession of
trust, (d) a petition, (e) a vow of praise.
7. Read Psalms 54 and 57, noting the superscriptions. Find the ele-
   ments of a lament in each of these psalms. (Not necessarily in the
   order given below).

   A cry for help
   The complaint

   A confession of trust
   Petition

   Praise to God
   Martin Luther once said that persecuted saints can best understand the
psalms. It is easy enough to shout glibly God's praises when all goes well
and we have enjoyed His blessings and favors. But faith born in crisis and
tested in the fiery crucible of adversity shines the brightest and sings His
praises the loudest.
   (Psalm 11 was sung and possibly even composed while David was hid-
ing in the Wilderness of Ziph. See Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 660, 661.)
   As you look back can you understand better why the Lord led you
as He did, even though at the time of your hardships you felt forsaken?

IV. THE DEATH OF SAMUEL (1 Sam. 25:1).
   For a short time there was a temporary reconciliation between David
and Saul. (This will be considered in next week's lesson.) After the death
of Samuel, David once more fled to the Wilderness of Paran. (1 Sam.
25:1.)

   The effect of Samuel's death. The death of Samuel the prophet was a
tragic loss to the nation. As founder and president of the schools of the
prophets, he had wielded a more powerful influence than Saul. The people
had come to see that their insistence on having a king had been a mistake,
but Samuel's ministry and intercession among them had given them a feel-
ing of security. Now their spiritual giant was gone. (See Patriarchs and
Prophets, pp. 663, 664.)
52
       A Hunted Fugitive and a Mad King                          February 16
         David mourned deeply the death of his spiritual mentor. Another bond
      of restraint on the mad king had been broken, and for David there was no
      safety. Again he fled, this time to the Wilderness of Paran. Hiding in the
      desolate wilds, he composed Psalm 121.

       8. Read Psalm 121 prayerfully and meditatively with David's cir-
          cumstances in mind. What would be the focus of your thinking
          under such circumstances?



         "The season of distress and anguish before us will require a faith that
      can endure weariness, delay, and hunger—a faith that will not faint though
      severely tried. . . . When waves of despair which no language can express
      sweep over the suppliant, how few cling with unyielding faith to the prom-
      ises of God."—The Great Controversy, p. 621.

      V. THE INFLUENCE OF A GODLY WOMAN (1 Sam. 25:2-42).

       9. How would you summarize briefly Nabal's occupation, status,
          and personality? 1 Sam. 25:2, 3.



      10. By contrast, what qualities did Abigail possess? 1 Sam. 25:3.



         Though living with a cantankerous man, Abigail revealed the inner
      beauty of a Spirit-filled life. She had not allowed her husband's behavior
      to tarnish her charm and courtesy. Her influence, like the fragrance of a
      flower, breathed out kindness, peace, and piety.

WED   11. What circumstances led to David's planned attack on Nabal?
          1 Sam. 25:4-13.



         Hospitality was and still is an obligation in the East. In addition, sheep-
      shearing time was a kind of harvest festival. Gift giving was in order.
      Nabal's refusal to provide supplies for David's men, by the culture of the
      time, was an insult, and a defiance of common courtesy.
         Nabal's feigned ignorance of David (1 Sam. 25:10) evidenced his rude
      and hostile spirit. David and his men must have been well-known by now.
      They were appreciated by Nabal's servants (verses 14-16). Later Abigail
      revealed that she knew of David's circumstances (verse 28).

        David could have lost the throne. This, of course, did not excuse
      David's rash response. "One violent attack by David on a well-known
      Judaean citizen would almost certainly have cost him the throne, and
      might well have led to his instant betrayal to Saul. So prudence as well as
                                                                                 53
 Lesson 7                                                  February 16
morality suggested that David should have swallowed the insults. Anger,
however justifiable, nearly always leads to overreaction."—David F.
Payne, / & // Samuel, p. 130, 131.

12. What was Abigail's immediate response? 1 Sam. 25:18-23.



   Abigail was not only wise and beautiful; she was also a woman of
action. Most women, living with a man like Nabal, might easily have
been intimidated and fearful. But Abigail showed great courage and ini-
tiative, first in assuming the responsibility of speaking for her husband,
and second by risking her safety in fearlessly going to meet David and
his men.

13. What was Abigail's request when she met David? 1 Sam. 25:24-
    31. (If possible, read verse 25 in some of the newer translations.)



   Abigail's character shines brightest in her willingness to bear her
husband's guilt. Abigail reflected the spirit of Jesus in being willing to be-
come a substitute for the sins of her wicked husband. " 'Please forgive the
trespass of your maidservant' " (1 Sam. 25:28, NKJV).

   Abigail's plea tactfully and wisely gave David two reasons why it was
not in his best interest to take vengeance on Nabal:
   a. If David was fighting the battles of the Lord, God would take care of
his enemies for him (1 Sam. 25:26, 28). Saul was making the mistake of
spending his energies in personal vendettas. David must not fall into that
same tragic trap.
   b. David must not stain his record with the guilt of bloodshed (1 Sam.
25:31). The abuse of power had been Saul's downfall; now David was
about to make the same mistake.

14. What does David's response to Abigail's warning tell us about his
    character? 1 Sam. 25:32-35.



   This is the first instance in the account of David's life that reveals his
truly great spirit; the spirit of humility when he was censured or corrected.
When Saul was reproved he blamed, rationalized, and hid behind false
piety. David humbly recognized that God had used a deeply sensitive
woman to save him from making a tragic mistake.

15. What consequent events led to Abigail's becoming David's wife?
    1 Sam. 25:36-42.



54
 A Hunted Fugitive and a Mad King                         February 16
   While not condoning polygamy, (but "the times of . . . ignorance God
winked at" [Acts 17:30]), the Bible simply records what happened. David
suffered the bitter results of marrying many wives (see Patriarchs and
Prophets, p. 668). Even so, his marriage to Abigail probably showed more
wisdom and foresight than any of his other alliances. (See 1 Sam. 25:43,
44; compare 2 Sam. 3:14-16.) The influence of this godly woman could
not help but be a blessing to the future ruler of Israel. David's prestige
among the southern tribes would be enhanced by his marriage to Nabal's
wealthy widow.

AM I CAPABLE OF CRITICAL SELF-EXAMINATION?
   • Do I use deception and half-truths under duress, or do I keep to the
truth whatever the embarrassment to myself?
   • Does stress tend to bring me closer to other members of my family,
or does it drive us apart?
   • When I am beset by foreboding, whether because of circumstances or
because of deep inner fears, do I trust in the Lord for deliverance, or do I
lose faith and give in to discouragement?
   • Do I manifest a spirit of compassion toward hostile people, or do I
react in kind?
   • How do I accept censure or criticism? Do I tend to blame and ration-
alize, or do I humbly admit and confess my mistakes?

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read from the chapters en-
titled "David a Fugitive" and "The Magnanimity of David" in Patriarchs
and Prophets, pp. 656-659, 663-668. Using a concordance, look for refer-
ences in Psalms for the words, poor, needy, and oppressed.

SUMMARY: David's life as a fugitive, running from an angry and unrea-
sonable king, helps us to appreciate his cries for help as recorded in the
psalms of lament. They are a source of comfort and encouragement for us
in times of trouble.

February 17-23


              How One Is Lost

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Samuel 24:1-22; 26:1-2 Samuel 1:27.

SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "And David said to Abishai, Destroy him
PM    not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the Lord's
      anointed, and be guiltless?" (1 Samuel 26:9).

PROGRESSIVE DECLINE. The unpardonable sin results from progres-
sive rejection of the Holy Spirit's conviction. The decline toward spiritual
ruin can be reversed by a positive response to the Lord's call to repentance.

OUTLINE:
   I. The Magnanimous David (1 Sam. 24:1-22; 26:1-25).
  11. David's Deception (1 Sam. 27:1-28:2; 29:1-11).
 I11. Tragedy at Ziklag (1 Sam. 30:1-31).
 IV. Saul Resorts to Witchcraft (1 Sam. 28:3-25).
  V. Death of Saul and Jonathan (1 Sam. 31:1-13; 2 Sam. 1:1-27).

SALVATION BY GRACE REQUIRES A HUMAN RESPONSE. This
week's study looks at the final tragic scenes of King Saul's life and his last
encounter with David. Although David was a man of war, his regard for
human life, especially in his relationship with Saul, shines out in the dark-
ness of the age in which he lived.
    Why did Saul die a lost man? What leads to one being lost for eternity?
There are two factors involved in salvation: (a) Christ's work in the heart
of the sinner; (b) the sinner's choice of God's saving work—his determina-
tion to depend on divine grace for power to live according to God's law.
The Lord was as much concerned to save Saul from sin as He is concerned
to save every human being. (See 2 Peter 3:9.) Did the Lord bring sufficient
conviction to the heart of Saul? The answer is obvious. Did Saul respond
appropriately? This lesson presents the answer.

I. THE MAGNANIMOUS DAVID (1 Sam. 24:1-22; 26:1-25).

   Because of the similarity of the two occasions on which David spared
Saul, let us consider them together. In both instances Saul was given evi-
dence beyond the shadow of doubt as to David's innocence of intent. In
each case Saul's repentance was short-lived. So long had he catered to his
depraved emotions that he seemed incapable of responding to reason.

1. Read the story of David's encounter with Saul in 1 Samuel 24,
   noting the location and circumstances. How did David prove to
56
 How One Is Lost                                          February 23
  Saul that he meant him no harm? Verse 4. What was David's
  reaction to his own action? Verses 5-7.



   David and his six hundred men, hiding in the rugged rocks and caves
near En-gedi, were no match for Saul's force of three thousand men. Ironi-
cally, Saul chose the very cave where David was hiding. Coming alone to
attend to his personal needs, his eyes accustomed to the bright sunshine, he
would not be able to see David and his men. But David's followers saw
him, and were sure this was the opportunity they had been waiting for.
    If David's anger and bitterness over Saul's treatment tempted him to
take advantage of the situation, his deep regard for the Lord's anointed re-
strained him. "His conscience smote him afterward, because he had even
marred the garment of the king."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 661.

2. How did David address Saul? 1 Sam. 24:11. What was Saul's
   response? Verse 16.



   Saul was David's father-in-law, though by the second time David
spared his life, Michal had been given to another man (1 Sam. 25:44). No-
tice the record in 1 Samuel 26:17 that David addressed him as king instead
of father.

3. With what figures from nature did David try to show Saul the ab-
   surdity of his continuing pursuit? 1 Sam. 24:14; 26:20.



    David's implication was clear. Saul had been virtually wasting his
time hunting David, as if picking for a flea, when the real enemy, the Phil-
istines, were encroaching on Israel's borders at an alarming rate.
    David's reference to the hunted partridge is poignant. Related to the
quail, and about its size, the sand partridge found in the wilderness region
west of the Dead Sea is a fast runner, and can jump from rock to rock.
Sometimes it runs so fast that it becomes exhausted and can be easily over-
taken.

   David longed for the hunt to be over. He longed for reconciliation
with Saul. He was tired of running. Fear overwhelmed him at times. (See
Ps. 64:1; 142:3.)
   The fear of the enemy who dogged his every move was perhaps more
devastating than the enemy himself. David well knew that Saul's kind
words addressed to him under the emotion of the moment would not sur-
vive the king's malicious intent. No wonder he prayed in Psalm 64:1 to be
delivered from the "fear of the enemy."

4. After declaring that David was to be his successor, what promise
   did Saul ask David to make? 1 Sam. 24:20-22.
                                                                 57
       Lesson 8                                                 February 23
      5. Compare the following points in the story recorded in 1 Samuel 26:
           Place of encounter (vs. 5-7)

           Who wanted to kill Saul (v. 8)
           David's response (vs. 9, 11)

           Method of disclosure (vs. 12-16)
           Saul's response (vs. 21, 25)
         David's tender conscience dictated to him "that no man has the right to
      attack a leader chosen and anointed by God, however wrong or ill-advised
      his actions."—David F. Payne, I & 11 Samuel, p. 137.

MON   6. What final appeal did David make to Saul? 1 Sam. 26:24.


         These may have been the last words ever spoken between the two men.
      David's regard for the sacredness of life was the result of his close rela-
      tionship with God. (See Ps. 8:4-8.) When he temporarily lost that rela-
      tionship, he lost his regard for human life. This fact is illustrated by the
      next episode in David's life.
         How do you act when you have an opportunity to destroy an
      enemy's reputation? Are your words and actions at such a time
      directed by Jesus' counsel (Matt. 5:43-45), or by your own desire for
      revenge? How can a vengeful spirit be overcome?
      11. DAVID'S DECEPTION (1 Sam. 27:1-28:2; 29:1-11).

      7. Following his last encounter with Saul, what was David's next
         move? What motivated him to this strange decision, and with what
         results? 1 Sam. 27:1-7.



         David and his men must have grown weary of constant movement from
      place to place. The tension of his exile existence finally got the best of
      him. Without counsel from God, he once more headed for Gath, where he
      would be out of the jurisdiction of Saul. By fleeing to his people's worst
      enemies for protection David not only was making himself vulnerable but
      also was exposing the weakness of his own people, a decision he would
      live to regret.
      8. How did David deceive Achish? 1 Sam. 27:8-12.



      58
 How One Is Lost                                         February 23
   Achish probably gave David the city of Ziklag on the condition that
David would act as a kind of mercenary for the Philistines, raiding the
towns and cities of Israel and bringing the booty back to Achish. In truth,
David was actually helping his own people by destroying their hated ene-
mies, the Amalekites and other nomad peoples. He hoped that by destroy-
ing every person, he could keep word of his deception from getting back to
Achish.
   Meanwhile, the Philistines prepared for battle against David's people.
So trusting was Achish of David that he never doubted his military sup-
port. The famous poet Sir Walter Scott wrote, "0, what a tangled web we
weave, when first we practice to deceive."

9. How did the Lord work to extricate David from his dilemma of
    having to fight against his own people? 1 Sam. 29:1-11. Try to
    imagine the range of emotions David must have experienced
    during this ordeal.



   David had made a serious blunder that almost cost him the throne. Had
he gone to war against his own people he certainly could not have become
their king. What would he do now?
   God looks at the heart and sees what no human can see. He knew that,
although David's faith had staggered, causing him to stumble away from
God's purpose, yet in his heart he still wanted to be true to God. He could
say: "0 Lord, do not rebuke me in Your anger. . . . Have mercy on me, . . .
for I am weak. . . . Return, 0 Lord, deliver me! Oh, save me for Your mer-
cies' sake!" (Ps. 6:1-4, NKJV).

  What does the above story indicate about the mercy and forgive-
ness of God?

I11. TRAGEDY AT ZIKLAG (1 Sam. 30:1-31).

   David and his men had traveled north to join the Philistine forces at
Aphek. On their return they found that the Amalekites had invaded Ziklag,
burning it to the ground and taking the women and children captive.

10. What was David's reaction? What was the reaction of his men?
    Where did he turn for help? 1 Sam. 30:4-8.



   David's folly had caught up with him. One bad decision had led to
another. Now he stood horrified to think that all he held dear in life was
gone. His followers, in the heat of rage and grief, were ready to stone him.
In his extremity "David strengthened himself in the Lord his God"
(1 Sam. 30:6, NKJV).

11. Who gave David counsel as to the course he should pursue?
    1 Sam. 30:7. With what results? Verses 9-20.
                                                                         59

      12. What debate arose over the division of the spoil? 1 Sam. 30:21,
          22. How did David settle the matter? Verses 23-31.



         Here David's unselfish spirit is clearly seen. Not only would those who
      had stayed by the stuff ("guard the equipment," verse 24, TLB) receive
      their fair share, but David took this opportunity to send gifts to the elders
      in Judah and the many other people who had befriended him in his
      wanderings.

      IV. SAUL RESORTS TO WITCHCRAFT (1 Sam. 28:3-25).

          The scene changes. While Saul had hunted his "flea," David, the Phil-
      istines had been planning their strategy. Up to now most of their battles
      had been fought in hilly or mountainous areas where the Israelites would
      have the advantage. The Philistines' superior weapons, especially their
      chariots, could be used to best advantage on level ground. Thus their thrust
      now was farther north in the broad Valley of Jezreel, the only place in
      Palestine where it is possible to reach the River Jordan from the coastal
      plain without having to cross mountains.
          Saul was in a panic. He prepared to meet the Philistine hosts, knowing
      that David himself might be among them. Frightened, like so many re-
      jecters of God, he sought His aid when all else seemed to fail. But God did
      not answer him.

WED   13. What three methods of seeking God's will did Saul explore?
          1 Sam. 28:6.



          Saul had alienated himself from God. "The king had by his own act
      forfeited the benefits of all the methods of inquiring of God. He had re-
      jected the counsel of Samuel the prophet; he had exiled David, the chosen
      of God; he had slain the priests of the Lord. Could he expect to be an-
      swered by God when he had cut off the channels of communication that
      Heaven had ordained? He had sinned away the Spirit of grace, and could
      he be answered by dreams and revelations from the Lord? Saul did not turn
      to God with humility and repentance. It was not pardon for sin, and recon-
      ciliation with God, that he sought, but deliverance from his foes. By his
      own stubbornness and rebellion he had cut himself off from God."—Patri-
      archs and Prophets, p. 676.

      14. What are your reactions to Saul's encounter with the witch at
          Endor? 1 Sam. 28:7-14. What were the results? Verses 15-20.



      15. What law that Saul himself had enforced was he now breaking?
          Lev. 20:27 (compare Deut. 18:9-14; 1 Sam. 28:3, 9).

      60
 How One Is Lost                                          February 23
   Those who suppose that God spoke through the real Samuel on this oc-
casion overlook several important points. Would God refuse communica-
tion with Saul through His ordained channels, and use instead a channel
that God Himself had condemned and for which He had ordered the death
penalty for those using it?
   Sorcery, witchcraft, and communication with the dead were the basis of
most of the heathen religions in Israel's day. The deification and worship
of the dead prompted God's severest judgments: "Because of these abom-
inations the Lord your God drives them out from before you" (Deut.
18:12, NKJV).
    In his desperation to know the outcome of the impending crisis, Saul
now turned to a demon, parading in the form of the aged prophet. The mes-
sage of denunciation and retribution goaded Saul on to his final ruin and
death.
    "By consulting that spirit of darkness, Saul had destroyed himself.
Oppressed by the horror of despair, it would be impossible for him to in-
spire his army with courage. . . . Thus the prediction of evil would work its
own accomplishment."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 681.

V. DEATH OF SAUL AND JONATHAN (1 Sam. 31:1-13; 2 Sam.
   1:1-27).

16. Recount the tragic story of Saul's death. 1 Sam. 31:1-10.



   Saul saw his three brave sons fall before him in battle. Now wounded
by the archers and unable to fight or flee, and determined not to be taken
alive by the enemy, Saul took his own life. "His life had been a failure,
and he went down in dishonor and despair, because he had set up his own
perverse will against the will of God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 682.

17. How did the men of Jabesh-gilead show their last respects to the
    king who had at one time saved them? 1 Sam. 31:11-13.



18. How did David learn about the death of Saul and Jonathan?
    2 Sam. 1:1-10. What happened to the young man who claimed to
    have speared Saul? Verses 13-16.



   Once more David showed his deep respect for the Lord's anointed. Al-
though he had been hated and hunted by Saul, David never lost reverence
for Saul's position as Israel's king.

19. How did David react to the news of the death of Saul and
    Jonathan? 2 Sam. 1:11, 12, 17. Read the "Song of the Bow,"
    which David wrote in honor of their death (verses 19-27). What
    does this song reveal about David's spirit?
                                                                61
 Lesson 8                                                         February 23
   David's genuine grief at the death of Saul and Jonathan gives evidence
of a truly generous and compassionate nature. Perhaps because he himself
so often had been the recipient of God's forgiveness he had the capacity to
forgive the one who had made his life miserable and sometimes almost un-
bearable. It was this dimension of David's life that at least in part made
him a man after God's own heart, and a type of Christ, who a thousand
years later would forgive those who put Him to death.

EVALUATE AND DISCUSS:
    • Who are the Lord's anointed in our present day?
    • What should be our attitude toward leaders in the church, even when
we disagree with them?
    • How should we relate to leaders in the church who obviously are not
acting in harmony with God's will? Is there a difference between refusing
to destroy the Lord's anointed and pointing out error and wrongdoing
when it arises? (See 1 Sam. 24:6; compare 1 Tim. 5:19.)
    • Is it possible for us to be preoccupied with hunting "personal par-
tridges" while ignoring or neglecting to guard against the real enemy?

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read Patriarchs and Proph-
ets, pp. 668-696, the chapters entitled, "The Magnanimity of David,"
"The Death of Saul," "Ancient and Modern Sorcery," "David at Zik-
lag." Read the account in 1 Chronicles 10 of Saul's death, noting espe-
cially verses 13 and 14.

SUMMARY: Although David made serious mistakes, he never lost his
implicit trust in God's providential leadings. King Saul, on the other hand,
having lost his faith and his desire to repent, took one wrong step after
another. Even when he momentarily had better impulses, he failed to turn
his heart to God. His tragic life stands as a warning against stubbornly set-
ting our will against the will of God.

              Righteous
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Samuel 2:1-5:25; 6:16-23; 8; 9; 10.

SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "Shew me thy ways, 0 Lord; teach my thy
PM    paths. Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God
      of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day" (Psalm 25:4, 5).

GOD'S PURPOSES WILL BE FULFILLED. There is nothing that
Satan and wicked people can do to prevent the fulfillment of God's plans
for those who put their trust in Him.

OUTLINE:
   I. David Anointed King (2 Sam. 2:1-7, 11).
  11. Conspiracy, Treachery, and Revenge (2 Sam. 2:8-4:12).
 I11. From Hebron to Jerusalem (2 Sam. 5:1-10, 17-25).
 IV. David's Family (2 Sam. 3:2-5, 12-16; 5:13-16; 6:20-23).
  V. Victory Over Enemies (2 Sam. 8:1-14; 10:1-19).
 VI. David's Righteous Rule (2 Sam. 8:15-9:13).

A TIME OF TRANSITION. With the death of Saul, the way was now
clear for David to return to his homeland. Although he believed that God
had chosen him to be the next king of Israel, David exercised caution and
deliberation. He had to overcome the influence of Saul's persistent hostil-
ity toward him before he could win the allegiance of all the tribes. He also
had to overcome the prejudice against him created by his sixteen months in
Gath, which could have alienated his own brethren in Judah. The challenge
before him required great wisdom and understanding, and above all, divine
guidance.
    David chose to follow the principle God uses in resolving the great
cosmic controversy—that of wooing His subjects' allegiance. He wins us
by friendship and love.

I. DAVID ANOINTED KING (2 Sam. 2:1-7, 11).

1. After the days of mourning for Saul were over, where did David
   turn before making any moves? 2 Sam. 2:1.



  One of the things that must have endeared David to his God was his
eagerness to know and to do His will. This theme can be seen in David's
                                                                    63
       Lesson 9                                                       March 2
     psalms: "Make me to know thy ways, 0 Lord; teach me thy paths. Lead
     me in thy truth, and teach me, for thou art the God of my salvation; for
     thee I wait all the day long" (Ps. 25:4, 5, RSV; compare 5:8; 27:11;
     119:33.)

     2. What instructions did David receive? And with what results?
        2 Sam. 2:1-4.



        David showed great skill and diplomacy by going to the men of Judah,
     his own people, who readily made him their king. Had he tried initially to
     win all Israel he well might have ruined his chances for reigning over a
     united Israel.

iii 3. What was David's first official act as Judah's new king? 2 Sam.
        2:5-7.



        In spite of Saul's hatred and conduct toward him, David manifested a
     genuine love for the king. Possibly his earliest experiences in playing his
     harp for Saul had left an indelible tenderness and respect that he never lost.
     Perhaps his respect was born of insight into God's love, which gave him
     the ability to love his enemy. Showing his last respects for the house of
     Saul by honoring the men of Jabesh-gilead, David won the confidence of
     his countrymen.

        Ask yourself: Do I manifest big-hearted forgiveness for my enemies
     before and after they have fallen? Do I make attempts to draw people to
     myself and to the Lord by a spirit of love and conciliation?

     11. CONSPIRACY, TREACHERY, AND REVENGE (2 Sam. 2:8-
         4:12).

        While David was taking the reins at Hebron, Abner, Saul's army
     general, determined to take control of the nation. Three of Saul's sons had
     been slain in battle; only his youngest son, Ishbosheth, survived.
        No doubt Abner was harboring bitterness over David's rebuke when he
     found Saul sleeping and took his water cruse and spear. (See 1 Sam. 26:13-
     16.) No doubt also Abner's personal ambition led him to support the weak
     Ishbosheth.

     4. What events took place as a result of Ishbosheth's becoming king
        over the northern tribes? 2 Sam. 2:12-32.



     5. Why did Abner desert to David? What were the consequences?
        2 Sam. 3:6-27. How did David's response to this treachery affect
        the people? Verses 31-39.
     64
 God Prospers the Righteous                                    March 2
   Distressed by the conduct of the abrasive Joab, David confided, "I am
weak today, though anointed king" (2 Sam. 3:39, NKJV). Because of
Joab's power and influence, and because David's own position was barely
established, David had few options for dealing with this delicate situation.
He left revenge for the crime to the Lord. (See also Ps. 94:1.)

6. How did David show his disdain for the bloody crime that paved
   the way for him to become king over all of Israel? 2 Sam. 4:9-12.



   The events of the early days of David's reign demonstrate the depravity
of the human heart when it separates from God. David had clearly shown
that he did not approve or desire treachery to establish his kingdom. His
tact and diplomacy in handling crises had won the hearts of the people.
The leaders of Israel now agreed that they needed a strong spiritual
monarch. And David was their man!

I11. FROM HEBRON TO JERUSALEM (2 Sam. 5:1-10, 17-25).

7. What three reasons did the elders of Israel give for choosing David
   as their new king? 2 Sam. 5:1-3.

   a.

   b.

   c.

   The coronation at Hebron was the third anointing for David. Samuel the
prophet had anointed him at Bethlehem when he unfolded God's plan to
him. The people of Judah had anointed him several years earlier. Now,
without force or coercion, David became king of a united Israel. "The rev-
olution was quiet and dignified, befitting the great work they were
doing."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 701.

   David a type of Christ. God had appointed David as the shepherd of
His people. (See 2 Sam. 5:2.) David's reign was to foreshadow the com-
ing Messiah. David the shepherd, now shepherd of God's flock, was a type
of the "Good Shepherd" to come. (See John 10:11; Isa. 40:11). David had
won the throne through suffering, sorrow, exile, and rejection. The Mes-
siah would win His throne by coming to earth to take on Him the suffer-
ings and sins of His people. (See Isa. 53:3-7.)

8. What incentive did David hold out to anyone who would defeat the
   Jebusites? Who accepted his challenge, and how did he do it?
   1 Chron. 11:6 (compare 2 Sam. 5:6-9).



   A new capital. One of the first acts of David as the king of the united
                                                                          65
 Lesson 9                                                        March 2
realm was to seek a more appropriate location for his throne. Hebron, in
the far south of Israel was an important center in Judah. David, wise states-
man that he was, felt that the capital should be located nearer the other ten
tribes. Situated between the borders of Judah and Benjamin, Jerusalem
would be a strategic location and a political asset to the new united king-
dom. The city of Jerusalem had a long history, dating back as far as the
third millennium B.C. (See Heb. 7:1, 2; Joshua 15:63; Judges 1:21.) It be-
came the type or analogy of the great heavenly Jerusalem in which Christ
will reign with His redeemed people. (See Rev. 21:2.)

   How David captured Jerusalem. "To bring water into the city from
the spring Gihon, which was without the city gates, the Jebusites had cut a
conduit some 60 ft. through the rock to a place where the water was col-
lected in a reservoir. This, in turn, was connected by a 40 ft. vertical shaft
with the foot of a stairway or ramp that led into the city. Women in the city
would descend to the top of the shaft, drop their buckets into the cistern,
and thus secure water without the necessity of venturing outside the city.
By making one's way through the watercourse and up the shaft, it might be
possible to enter the Jebusite capital. . . .
   After an entrance into the city had been gained, it would probably be a
comparatively easy task to open the gates to the main body of David's
forces, since, perhaps, only a small force of defenders would be on the city
walls."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2, p. 620.

9. According to 2 Samuel 5:10, what was the secret of David's suc-
    cess as Israel's shepherd? Compare 1 Chron. 11:9. Read Psalm
    20 in this setting, noting particularly verses 5, 7.



10. What did David do before going to battle with the Philistines?
    2 Sam. 5:19, 22, 23. With what results? Verses 20, 25.



  The spiritual message. Jesus emphasized the spiritual lesson that
David's success illustrated. "If you abide in me, and my words abide in
you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you" (John 15:7,
RSV).

IV. DAVID'S FAMILY (2 Sam. 3:2-5, 12-16; 5:13-16; 6:20-23).

   One of the evidences of the authenticity of Scripture is its frank honesty
even when describing its heroes. For all of David's greatness and ad-
mirable virtues, he also had weaknesses. Nowhere is this more evident than
in his family life.

11. What is recorded regarding David's marriages and offspring?
    2 Sam. 3:2-5.


66
       God Prospers the Righteous                                    March 2
          God had declared that kings were not to multiply wives, as was the cus-
      tom among the surrounding nations. (See Deut. 17:17.) In those days a
      king's prestige and power was often measured by the size of his harem. So
      it is understandable, though certainly not defensible, why David (2 Sam.
      5:13), and later Solomon (1 Kings 11:1), succumbed to the pressures of
      their culture.
          Polygamy inevitably brought confusion, jealousy, conflict, and heart-
      ache. "The bitter result of marrying many wives was sorely felt throughout
      all the life of David."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 668.

      12. Note David's attempt to recover his first wife, Michal, the
          daughter of Saul. 2 Sam. 3:12-16. What was the unhappy ending
          to David's relationship with her? 2 Sam. 6:20-23.



         David's sense of awe and reverence before the sacred ark caused him to
      lay aside his royal robes and attire himself in a plain linen ephod, such as
      the priests wore. By this act he signified that he was taking his place
      among his subjects as an equal. "Upon that day Jehovah was to be adored.
      He was to be the sole object of reverence."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p.
      707. This was too much for the proud and cynical daughter of Saul. She
      despised David's piety and humility that condemned not only herself, but
      her father.

WED   V. VICTORY OVER ENEMIES (2 Sam. 8:1-14; 10:1-19).

      13. Read the account of David's victories over his enemies in
          2 Samuel 8:1-12. List the nations he subdued.



         "During Saul's reign, David had been on good terms with the king of
      Moab, for he had sent his parents there (1 Samuel 22:30. David's own
      great-grandmother, Ruth, had been a Moabitess (Ruth 4:130. So his con-
      quest of Moab and his subsequent savage treatment of the Moabites
      (2 Samuel 8:2) suggest that they must have broken faith with him in some
      particularly treacherous fashion. We can only guess, but it is at least con-
      ceivable that they took the opportunity to attack him when he was engaged
      in the life-and-death struggle with the major foe, the Philistines." —David
      F. Payne, Kingdoms of the Lord (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1981),
      pp. 46, 47.

      14. What occasioned the insult to David's men by a former ally?
          2 Sam. 10:1-5. What were the results? Verses 6-19.



         This story gives us insight into the political condition of the times. The
      various states in Syria-Palestine, engaging in a constant power struggle,
      formed military alliances that often threatened Israel's existence as a na-
                                                                                 67
 Lesson 9                                                      March 2
tion. They relied on their military prowess. David and his army relied on
the Lord of hosts.
   "Through You we will push down our enemies; through Your
name we will trample those who rise up against us" (Ps. 44:5, NICJV;
read also verses 4-8).
VI. DAVID'S RIGHTEOUS RULE (2 Sam. 8:15-9:13).
   Above his exploits and military victories stands this tribute to David's
reign: "David reigned over all Israel, doing what was just and right for all
his people" (2 Sam. 8:15, NIV). What better tribute could be given to any
ruler? What better fortune could come to a nation than that its leader exer-
cise equity and justice?
15. Comment on David's dealings with Mephibosheth. 2 Samuel 9.

     The king's request (vs. 1-3)


     The circumstances of Mephibosheth's lameness (2 Sam. 4:4)


     David and Mephibosheth's meeting (2 Sam. 9:6-8)


     A promise fulfilled (vs. 9-13; compare 1 Sam. 20:14-17)


   A royal resolve. Read Psalm 101, which well might have been King
David's charter for a successful reign. If possible, read this psalm in some
of the newer translations, noting the ten summary points below:
   a. My conduct will be faultless, v. 2.
   b. I will live a pure life, v. 2.
   c. I will not tolerate evil, v. 3.
   d. I will have no dealings with evil, v. 4.
   e. I will get rid of anyone who whispers evil about another, v. 5.
   f. I will not tolerate a proud or arrogant person, v. 5.
   g. I will approve the faithful and let them live in my palace, v. 6.
   h. No liar will live in my palace, v. 7.
   i. No hypocrite will remain in my presence, v. 7.
   j. I will expel evil from the city of the Lord, v. 8.
16. Evaluate how well David lived up to his own charter.

    SUMMARY: David's life and experience provide us with a beautiful ex-
    ample of humble trust in God. God is waiting for men and women who
    will seek His will first in every decision they make, and who are willing to
    admit their mistakes and make the necessary changes. Even though he
    made serious mistakes and fell into grievous sins, David always turned to
    the Lord in true penitence and submission.

March 3-9


      The Eternal Throne of
              David
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Samuel 6:1-15; 7:1-29.

SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "I have made a covenant with my chosen, I
PM    have sworn unto David my servant, Thy seed will I establish for
      ever, and build up thy throne to all generations" (Psalm 89:3, 4).

THE KINGDOM OF CHRIST is presented in Scripture as the perpetua-
tion of David's throne. God's promises to David are fulfilled in the eternal
reign of the Son of God.

OUTLINE:
   I. David Attempts to Move the Ark (2 Sam. 6:1-9).
  11. A New Home for the Ark (2 Sam. 6:10-15).
 I11. David Desires to Build a House for God (2 Sam. 7:1-7).
 IV. God Makes a Covenant with David (2 Sam. 7:8-17).
  V. David Praises the Lord (2 Sam. 7:18-29).

A KINGDOM UNDER GOD. Although God had been reluctant to give
Israel a king, He responded to their demand on condition that they still rec-
ognize Him as their supreme Monarch. Saul had miserably failed to learn
this lesson, taking upon himself prerogatives that God never intended.
   No doubt it was Samuel's tutorship, as well as the Holy Spirit's in-
fluence, that taught David the proper concept of the Divine Kingship.
Many of the psalms reveal this: "Give heed to the voice of my cry, my
King and my God" (Ps. 5:2, NKJV); "The Lord reigns. . . . Your throne is
established from of old" (Ps. 93:1, 2, NKJV); "For the Lord is the great
God, and the great King above all gods" (Ps. 95:3, NKJV); "The Lord
reigns. . . . Righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne"
(Ps. 97:1, 2, NKJV).
   Jesus Christ was hailed as the "Son of David" (Matt. 15:22; 21:9).
This was a title indicating His Messiahship and His inheritance of David's
throne. The angel's promise to Mary prior to the conception of Jesus as-
sured her that He would receive "the throne of his father David" (Luke
1:32). The resurrected Christ possesses the "key of David" (Rev. 3:7), the
means of admitting believers to sit with Him on His throne (Rev. 3:21).
Therefore, God's faithful people of all ages will belong to the eternal king-
dom of David, the "kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ" who shall
"reign for ever and ever" (Rev. 11:15, RSV). God will fulfill the promises
to David much more magnificently than they could have been through an
unending earthly dynasty.

 The Eternal Throne of David                                     March 9
I. DAVID ATTEMPTS TO MOVE THE ARK (2 Sam. 6:1-9).

1. Review the Mosaic instructions regarding the origin of the ark and
   its contents. Ex. 25:8-16, 21, 22; Deut. 10:1-5.



   The ark contained the two tables of stone upon which God Himself had
written the Ten Commandments. "The law of God, enshrined within the
ark, was the great rule of righteousness and judgment. That law pro-
nounced death upon the transgressor; but above the law was the mercy
seat, upon which the presence of God was revealed, and from which, by
virtue of the atonement, pardon was granted to the repentant sinner."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 349.
   The ark was sometimes called the ark of the testimony (Ex. 30:6) or the
ark of the covenant (Num. 10:33; 14:44). The Ten Commandments were
the basis of the covenant made between God and man (Ex. 19:5, 6).

2. What specific instructions had God given regarding the transport
   of the sacred chest? Ex. 25:14; Num. 4:5, 6, 15, 19, 20; 7:9.



3. What preparations did David make to bring the ark to his new
   capital? 2 Sam. 6:1, 2; compare 1 Chron. 13:1-5.



   For twenty long years, since the return of the ark by the Philistines, it
had remained in Kirjath-jearim in the house of Abinadab.
   Now that David had established himself upon the throne of Israel, he
turned his energies to bringing the ark of the covenant to his new capital. For
many years the Jews had neglected this sacred symbol. David's expressed
desire to make Jerusalem the home of the ark is recorded in Psalm 132:4, 5:
"I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids, until I find
out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob."

4. How was the return of the ark celebrated? 2 Sam. 6:3-5 (compare
   1 Chron. 13:7, 8).



   Picture the triumphant scene. Aglow with holy zeal, David leads the
people of Israel in songs of rejoicing. Shouts of joy fill the air and echo
back through the valleys. That vast throng is filled with awe and gladness
as the grand procession winds its way toward the holy city.

5. What tragedy put a sudden end to the joyous celebration? 2 Sam.
   6:6-8.


                                                                            71
       Lesson 10                                                   March 9
          The ark had been in the home of Abinadab for many years, and Uzzah,
      as a member of the family, should have known how it should be handled.
      Perhaps Uzzah had become so accustomed to the presence of the ark that
      it no longer seemed sacred to him.
          Severe though it may seem, Uzzah's death was necessary in order to
      teach Israel that they must recognize God's holiness and the importance of
      faithful obedience to His revealed will.

MON   6. How did David respond to Uzzah's death? 2 Sam. 6:8, 9.



         Afraid and disappointed though he was, David wanted to do God's will.
      It may have been his meditation on this event that led him to write: "Who
      may ascend into the hill of the Lord? Or who may stand in His holy place?
      He who has clean hands and a pure heart" (Ps. 24:3, 4, NKJV; compare
      Psalm 15, also written for the occasion.)

         How should we react when God sternly rebukes our sins and mis-
      takes? Do we blame Him for defending the honor of His holy name?
      Or do we admit our sin, ask for forgiveness, and seek His grace for
      reformation of life?

      11. A NEW HOME FOR THE ARK (2 Sam. 6:10-15).

      7. What prompted David to try once more to move the ark to Jeru-
         salem? 2 Sam. 6:10, 11. What preparations did he now make for
         housing and moving the ark? 1 Chron. 15:1, 2.



         "Upon David the divine rebuke accomplished its work. He was led to
      realize as he had never realized before the sacredness of the law of God
      and the necessity of strict obedience. The favor shown to the house of
      Obed-edom led David again to hope that the ark might bring a blessing to
      him and to his people."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 706.

         Why is there need for strict obedience to God's law? What moti-
      vates us to assent to His way?

      8. Contrast the second occasion of transporting the ark with the first.
         2 Sam. 6:12-15; compare 1 Chron. 15:25-28.



        Picture the triumphal procession. A choir on the city wall sings the
      words written for this occasion in Psalm 24:7-10:
           "Lift up your heads, 0 ye gates;
           And be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors;
           And the King of glory shall come in."
        Back comes the question:
      72
 The Eternal Throne of David                                    March 9
       "Who is this King of glory?"
    The antiphonal choir responds:
       "The Lord strong and mighty,
       The Lord mighty in battle."
    Finally hundreds of voices unite to swell the triumphant chorus:
       "Lift up your heads, 0 ye gates;
       Even lift them up, ye everlasting doors;
       And the King of glory shall come in."
    "Then the gates were opened wide, the procession entered, and with
reverent awe the ark was deposited in the tent that had been prepared for
its reception."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 708.
    An infinitely more awe-inspiring scene occasioned the singing of Psalm
24; a scene that gladdened the heart of every angel in glory, when Christ
the eternal Son of David was ushered into the heavenly Holy City after His
resurrection. (See The Desire of Ages, pp. 833-835.)

9. How would the presence of the ark in Zion (Jerusalem) affect
    Israel's neighbors? Ps. 46:4-11; 48:4-8. What influence would it
    have on God's people? Ps. 48:1-3, 9-14.


   Zion became symbolic of the sanctuary as the dwelling place of God.
The ark was the very heart and center of the tabernacle services. The
Shekinah glory resided above it. When the Philistines captured the ark
Eli's daughter-in-law in her dying moments had named her child Ichabod,
"the glory has departed" (1 Sam. 4:21, 22). Now David succeeded in re-
storing this important aspect of Israel's worship to its rightful place in the
heart of the nation, at the center of its existence.
   Is the Lord enthroned in our hearts and homes as the center of our
lives and our worship? As individuals and as families do we daily wor-
ship, adore, and praise Him?

I11. DAVID DESIRES TO BUILD A HOUSE FOR GOD (2 Sam.
     7:1-7).

10. What two situations prompted David to want to build a per-
    manent house for the ark? 2 Sam. 7:1, 2. Who encouraged him to
    proceed? 2 Sam. 7:3.


   Since the destruction of Shiloh, twenty years earlier, the sanctuary built
by Moses had not had a home. David purposed to make Jerusalem the re-
ligious center of the nation by building a magnificent temple that would
glorify God. He wished to express Israel's appreciation for the honor of
having the sacred ark in their midst and for the supreme honor of having
the abiding presence of Yahweh their King.
11. What disappointing message came to David through the prophet?
                                                               73
       Lesson 10                                                      March 9
           2 Sam. 7:4-13 (compare 1 Chron. 17:4, 5; 22:8-10).

         David was instructed that because he was a man of war it was not ap-
      propriate for him to build the temple (1 Chron. 22:8-10). Through Nathan
      God gave an emphatic No to David's sincere purpose. It had been about
      450 years since the Exodus. During those years there had been no per-
      manent building for carrying on the tabernacle services. A temple such as
      David wanted to build would have to wait a little longer!

      12. Although David was not allowed to build the temple, what
          preparations did he make for his son to do so? 2 Sam. 8:11 (com-
          pare 1 Kings 7:51).



         Responsibilities not given. "Instead of gratefully submitting to the
      divine direction, many fall back as if slighted and rejected, feeling that if
      they cannot do the one thing which they desire to do, they will do nothing.
      Many cling with desperate energy to responsibilities which they are in-
      capable of bearing, and vainly endeavor to accomplish a work for which
      they are insufficient, while that which they might do, lies neglected. And
      because of this lack of co-operation on their part the greater work is
      hindered or frustrated."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 712, 713.

WED   IV. GOD MAKES A COVENANT WITH DAVID (2 Sam. 7:8-17).

      13. Enumerate the things God had done for David in the past, of
          which the prophet now reminded him. 2 Sam. 7:8, 9.



      14. What promise regarding Israel did God renew to David? 2 Sam.
          7:10 (compare Deut. 11:22-28; 30:16).



         "The kingdom of Israel had now reached in extent the fulfillment of the
      promise given to Abraham, and afterward repeated to Moses: . . . [Gen.
      15:18 quoted]. Israel had become a mighty nation, . . . [David] com- •
      manded, as few sovereigns in any age have been able to command, the af-
      fections and allegiance of his people. He had honored God, and God was
      now honoring him."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 716.

      15. Though denying him the privilege of building a house for God,
          what promise did God give David? 2 Sam. 7:11-13, 16 (compare
          1 Chron. 17:11, 12).



        The Hebrew word for house, means a house used as a dwelling. It also
      may be used in reference to the house of God, and it frequently is used in
      74
 The Eternal Throne of David                                     March 9
the Bible to designate a family or tribe. So God's response to David was,
"I will not let you build a house for me, instead I will build a house for
you" (2.Sam. 7:11).
   Saul had sought for himself a dynasty, but God had refused and re-
moved him from the throne (2 Sam. 7:15). David received the assurance
that his son would inherit his throne and that his kingdom would be estab-
lished forever.
    Although Israel's failure to fulfill the terms of the everlasting covenant
made it impossible for David's dynasty to continue in this world of sin, it
will continue for eternity as Jesus Christ, the Son of David, shares His
throne with His redeemed people. (See the introduction to this lesson.)

16. What else did God promise regarding David's son? 2 Sam. 7:13,
    14. How was this promise later fulfilled? 1 Kings 5:1-5; 11:31-39.



   Solomon had the privilege denied to David of building a house for his
God. Probably one of the most beautiful buildings ever built by human
hands, Solomon's Temple stood until 586 B.C. as a monument of God's
promise to David.

   The Davidic Covenant. This solemn agreement with David equaled the
covenant made with Abraham some seven hundred years before. As the
patriarch glimpsed into the future and saw the coming Messiah through the
offering of his son on Mt. Moriah, so now the king was given prophetic in-
sight. His was the privilege of being the forebear of the Messiah King.

   Psalm 110 refers to the Messiah. Most of the Messianic psalms
have a historic application. Psalm 110 (and possibly 22) are unique in
that they apply solely to the Messiah. The New Testament writers rec-
ognized David as a prophet, and referred to these Messianic prophecies
frequently. Note how Jesus used Psalm 110 to prove His divinity (Matt.
22:41-46). Note Peter's use of this psalm in his sermon on the Day of
Pentecost (Acts 2:29-35).
   Jesus was often called "The Son of David" (Matt. 15:22; 21:9). Yet the
very people who should have known and recognized Him as a fulfillment
of David's prophecies demanded that He be put to death.

   Have you accepted Christ as your King whose reign you may share
eternally?

V. DAVID PRAISES THE LORD (2 Sam. 7:18-29).

17. What does David's reaction to the message from God and the
    covenant made with him reveal about His character? 2 Sam.
    7:18-29.



   Overwhelmed with what he had just heard, David bowed low before the
                                                                            75
 Lesson 10                                                     March 9
King of kings in humble adoration and prayer. The safest place in the uni-
verse for any human being is on his knees before the King.
SELF-EVALUATION:
   • How do I handle disappointments? Am I willing to submit to God's
will even when it means giving up long-cherished goals or ambitions?
How do I relate to those chosen to succeed me? Can I support and en-
courage those who accomplish what I had hoped to do?
   • Do I have a sense of awe and reverence for God's holiness and great-
ness, or have I allowed sacred things to become commonplace? Do I have
a sense of the reality of God's presence? Have I learned to balance the fol-
lowing two concepts of God: His transcendence (His holiness and great-
ness) with His imminence (the reality of His presence)?
FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read in Patriarchs and
Prophets the chapter entitled "The Reign of David," pp. 703-716. In re-
gard to the ark, read: Joshua 3:7-17; 6:6-16, 20; Psalm 132; 68:24-26.
SUMMARY: The ark of the covenant is a symbol of God's presence.
David and his people learned not to take lightly the holiness of God or His
express commands. God chose David, a man of like passions with us, to
become a type of the Messiah King. The promises God made in His
covenant with David were fulfilled in Jesus Christ. Through Him, those
promises become ours.

                 Sin and Its
                Consequences
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Samuel 11:1-14:33.

SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "If thou, Lord, shouldst mark iniquities, 0
PM    Lord, who shall stand? But there is forgiveness with thee, that
      thou mayest be feared" (Psalm 130:3, 4).

OUR WRETCHEDNESS MATCHED BY GOD'S MERCY. Although
sin always carries terrible consequences, human wretchedness is much
more than matched by God's mercy and power to forgive and heal.

OUTLINE:
   I. David's Fall (2 Sam. 11:1-25).
  11. "You Are the Man!" (2 Sam. 11:26-12:12).
 HI. David's Repentance (2 Sam. 12:13, 14).
 IV. The High Cost of Sin (2 Sam. 12:15-25; 13:1-39).
  V. Joab, David, and Absalom (2 Sam. 12:26-31; 14:1-33).

PRIDE GOES BEFORE A FALL. The events of our study this week
probably took place about midterm in David's forty-year reign. His sons
had grown to young manhood. He was by now a man of maturity who had
distinguished himself as a wise and admirable statesman. His kingdom had
been established among the surrounding nations as a power to be re-
spected, if not honored. David had met and conquered many enemies. Now
he was to meet the greatest enemy of all—his own carnal nature. The peril
of pride, aroused by too much praise and exaltation, would prove to be his
undoing.
   We might wish that the sacred record had omitted this part of the story.
But characteristically the Bible "tells it like it is," avoiding the human
tendency to idealize a person above measure. We may learn from the mis-
takes of others, if we will! The Bible includes the record of sin so that the
cure can be fully demonstrated.
   The downhill path is usually a gradual, imperceptible decline. Accord-
ing to Patriarchs and Prophets, page 717, five evil influences led to
David's fall: (1) A spirit of self-confidence and self-exaltation. (2) Flattery
and praise. (3) The subtle allurements of power and luxury. (4) The per-
vading influence of surrounding nations which held that the law applied to
subjects, but exempted monarchs. (5) Trust in his own wisdom and might
instead of leaning on God.
    "The work of the enemy is not abrupt; it is not, at the outset, sudden
and startling; it is a secret undermining of the strongholds of principle. It
                                                                             77
 Lesson 11                                                   March 16
begins in apparently small things—the neglect to be true to God and to rely
upon Him wholly, the disposition to follow the customs and practices of
the world."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 718.

I. DAVID'S FALL (2 Sam. 11:1-25).

1. Review briefly the events that led to David's sin of adultery.
   2 Samuel 11:1-5. Note the following:

     The fruits of victory (v. 1)

     Who was Bathsheba? (v. 3)

     The results (v. 5)

   Earlier in life the influence of a wise and discreet woman had saved
David from bloodshed and tragedy. Now he plunged himself into the snare
of sin and guilt for the momentary pleasure of a woman's physical beauty.
Did Bathsheba know that David could see her from his balcony? Was she
aware that he was attracted to her? Was she flattered by his attentions? Did
she resist his advances or willingly comply? Did she remonstrate with him
or did she demurely concede to his desires? The record is silent. In any
case, David's sin was his own responsibility. How different the future
might have been had Bathsheba been an Abigail! Who can measure the in-
fluence of a virtuous woman? "Her worth is far above rubies" (Prov.
31:10, NKJV).

2. How did David try to cover his tracks so that no one would dis-
   cover his sin? 2 Sam. 11:6-13. What indicates that Uriah the Hit-
   tite was a believer? Verse 11.



3. In desperation, what shameful plan did David conceive to extricate
   himself from the web of his own making? 2 Sam. 11:14, 15. With
   what results? Verses 16-21. What was David's response? Verses
   22-25.



   David was a man of great passion. Channeled into noble purposes
and controlled by the Holy Spirit, he used this passion to bless the
world with some of the greatest music and poetry of all time. But when
he became self-indulgent, holy passion turned to lust, and lust quickly
became adultery (see James 1:14, 15). Now with a guilt-laden con-
science, he plunged into the dark pit of duplicity, deception, and finally
murder.

  Can you remember how, when you were living outside of Christ,
you attempted to conceal one sin by committing another?

78
 Sin and Its Consequences                                   March 16
11. "YOU ARE THE MAN!" (2 Sam. 11:26-12:12).

4. What indicates that David remained in an unrepentant state for a
   period of time? 2 Sam. 11:26, 27.



   Perhaps David thought he had succeeded in hiding his sin. But there
was One from whom he could not hide. (See Ps. 139:1-12.) "The thing
that David had done displeased the Lord" (2 Sam. 11:27.) Just as God had
sent Samuel to confront Saul, God was about to confront David through
the prophet Nathan. Would he resist and rebel as Saul had? Or would he
repent?

   God sees all. "The guilty may attempt, as David had done, to conceal
their crime from men; they may seek to bury the evil deed forever from
human sight or knowledge; but 'all things are . . . opened unto the eyes of
Him with whom we have to do.' Hebrews 4:13."—Patriarchs and Proph-
ets, p. 721.

5. How did Nathan describe David's sin? 2 Sam. 12:1-4. After David
   had pronounced his own sentence, what pointed message did
   Nathan deliver to him? 2 Sam. 12:5-12.



   David's heart was not so hard that he had lost his sense of justice and
equity. The simple parable used by the prophet once again stirred his pas-
sion, but this time against injustice and wrong.
   Sin bears its own consequences. Even God's great mercy and forgive-
ness could not alter the awful law of cause and effect. He reaped what he
had sown. David had tried to hide his sin by the sword. Now the sword
would never depart from his house as long as he lived.
   The sentence pronounced was not an arbitrary punishment on God's
part, but the natural harvest of David's own doing. He himself had
changed on several levels:
   a. His relationship to God had changed from trust to guilt.
   b. His spirit was broken, thus weakening his influence over his subjects
and short-circuiting his administrative initiative.
   c. His authority over his own household was weakened, resulting in per-
missiveness because of his own evil example.

   Can you recall your miserable condition when you became con-
victed that you were a sinner in need of a Saviour? What led you to
turn to Christ for merciful forgiveness and healing?

I11. DAVID'S REPENTANCE (2 Sam. 12:13, 14).

6. How did David respond to Nathan's confrontation? 2 Sam. 12:13,
   14.

                                                                         79
 Lesson 11                                                      March 16
   Notice how Nathan approached the matter. A direct rebuke would prob-
ably have resulted in a hostile defense, but having David condemn himself
brought the desired result.
   "The prophet's rebuke touched the heart of David; conscience was
aroused; his guilt appeared in all of its enormity. . . . All wrong done to
others reaches back from the injured one to God. David had committed a
grievous sin, toward both Uriah and Bathsheba, and he keenly felt this. But
infinitely greater was his sin against God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p.
722.

    Confrontation. The only way to deal with sin is through confrontation.
Nathan the prophet had confronted David with his sin. Now David
willingly confronted his own guilt by confession, not only of his sin but of
his sinful nature. Finally, through repentance, he was once again able to
confront God in petition for acceptance and blessing. Gratitude and praise
filled his heart as he realized that the Lord had forgiven him.

7. Read David's description of his own sinful nature and his
   acknowledgment of his sin. Ps. 6:6; 38:1-10; 51:1-5. What does this
   say about the genuineness of David's repentance?



   "Thus in a sacred song to be sung in the public assemblies of his
people, in the presence of the court—priests and judges, princes and men
of war—and which would preserve to the latest generation the knowledge
of his fall, the king of Israel recounted his sin, his repentance, and his hope
of pardon through the mercy of God. Instead of endeavoring to conceal his
guilt he desired that others might be instructed by the sad history of his
fall."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 725.

8. What was David's understanding of the basis of God's forgive-
   ness? Ps. 25:6, 7; 103:10-14, 17; 130:4, 7, 8.



   Through the tragedy and guilt of his own sin, and facing the judgment
and awful retribution that sin brings, David understood more fully the good
news of the gospel: "He hath not dealt with us according to our sins" but
"as far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgres-
sions from us" (Ps. 103:10, 12, NKJV). David learned to appreciate as
never before that if the Lord should remember our sins against us none of
us would stand a chance: "But there is forgiveness with thee" (Ps. 130:4).

9. What spiritual experiences were involved in the forgiveness that
   David sought?

     Ps. 51:7; 32:2

     Ps. 51:10; 103:3-5

80
 Sin and Its Consequences                                    March 16
  Ps. 51:11, 12

  Ps. 25:4, 5

10. Along with other Bible writers, David defines the kind of
    sacrifices for sin God desires. Discuss Psalm 51:16, 17.



    The sacrifices that please God are the humble and contrite heart (Ps.
51:17), loving obedience to His will (Ps. 40:6-8), and the sacrifices of
praise and thanksgiving (Ps. 50:23).
    David knew that he deserved nothing and owed everything to the
wonderful mercy and lovingkindness of God. In a contrite spirit he brought
his offerings once more into the presence of his God, saying: "Come and
listen, all you who fear God: let me tell you what he has done for me" (Ps.
66:16, NIV).

   Can you recall your joy when you discovered that you are pure
when Christ purifies you (1 Cor. 6:11)? You may be willing to tell a
friend, or relative, or even your Sabbath School class how different
your life is when you know you are in a right relationship with God.

IV. THE HIGH COST OF SIN (2 Sam. 12:15-25; 13:1-39).

11. How soon after Nathan's message did the first part of David's
    fourfold punishment strike? Can you explain David's reaction?
    2 Sam. 12:15-23.



   We can never fully prepare for the death of a loved one, but when there
is opportunity, remorse and guilt should be dealt with before the loss oc-
curs. Grief alone is difficult enough for us to bear without the added bur-
den of self-accusation. Guilt and unrelieved grief can block the channels of
positive living and cause all kinds of problems, including illness. (See Ps.
103:3.)

12. Why did Nathan the prophet give another name to the second
    son of Bathsheba, whom David named Solomon? 2 Sam. 12:24,
    25.



   Jedidiah means "beloved of Jehovah." One of the mysteries of God's
grace is His choice of Solomon. The Lord chose Solomon as He had
chosen David his father. God gave the repentant king the assurance of His
acceptance by naming and loving his son.

13. What circumstances led to the second part of David's punishment
    by the sword? 2 Sam. 13:1-33.
 Lesson 11                                                    March 16
   Why does Scripture devote a whole chapter to such a sordid story?
David F. Payne suggests in his commentary four reasons: (1) The story de-
scribes part of David's fourfold punishment. (2) The details are necessary
to set the stage for subsequent events. (3) The story serves as a warning
against the dangers of moral lapses by those in high positions. (4) God's
overruling providence can use even our sins to bring about His own pur-
poses.

    God removes His restraining hand. "David had neglected the duty of
punishing the crime of Amnon, and because of the unfaithfulness of the
king and father and the impenitence of the son, the Lord permitted events
to take their natural course, and did not restrain Absalom. When parents or
rulers neglect the duty of punishing iniquity, God Himself will take the
case in hand. His restraining power will be in a measure removed from the
agencies of evil, so that a train of circumstances will arise which will
punish sin with sin."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 728.

  What modern examples can you think of in which sin has been
punished with sin?

V. JOAB, DAVID, AND ABSALOM (2 Sam. 12:26-31; 14:1-33).

14. How did Joab show his loyalty to David in his capture of Rab-
    bah? 2 Sam. 12:26-29.



    "Rabbah [modern day Amman, Jordan] was situated in the narrow val-
ley of the upper Jabbok River. The citadel was on a cliff, evidently a
walled city apart from the lower town. This lower town was called 'the city
of waters,' probably because of the spring that there flowed into the river.
When this lower city was taken by Joab, the loss of the water supply made
it impossible for the defenders to hold the upper city long."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 2, pp. 653, 654.

15. Alienated from his father, where did Absalom, the murderer,
    seek refuge? 2 Sam. 13:37, 38. How did David relate to these
    events? Verse 39.



   David's heart longed for his son's return, but his better judgment told
him that he must strictly apply the law.

16. How did Joab try to negotiate a reconciliation between David and
    Absalom? 2 Sam. 14:1-20. What was David's response to the
    request? What were the results? Verses 21-24.



     "This tender and touching portrayal of the love of God toward the sin-
82
      Sin and Its Consequences                                         March 16
     ner—coming as it did from Joab, the rude soldier—is a striking evidence
     of the familiarity of the Israelites with the great truths of redemption."—
     Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 728.
        David seemed paralyzed in handling the affairs of state. Weakness and
     indecision had replaced his courage and purpose. The judgment he had
     pronounced upon himself was falling heavy and hard.

     HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND?
         • A sermon or something you have read in the Bible has convicted you
     of a sin in your personal life. Will you: (a) try to hide it; (b) rationalize that
     it is not so bad; (c) confess and forsake it?
         • You have learned that a church leader has fallen morally. Will you:
     (a) tell a friend; (b) condemn and decry how terrible it is; (c) pray for the
     spiritual restoration of all concerned?
         • Your doctor has just informed you that you have a very serious ill-
     ness, which may be due to your lifestyle before you became a Christian.
     Will you: (a) blame God; (b) be angry at yourself; (c) humbly resign your-
     self to the law of cause and effect; (d) trust fully in Christ's gift of eternal
     life, despite the suffering and its possible results?

     FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read the chapter entitled
ua   "David's Sin and Repentance" in Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 717-726.
     Read the following penitential psalms noting the elements of confession,
     petition, and praise in each: Psalms 32, 38, 51.

     SUMMARY: No one, not even a monarch, is exempt from the awful con-
     sequences of sin. By His great mercy and tender lovingkindness, God
     changes our despair and tragedy to acceptance of His infinite grace and
     forgiveness.




                                                                                    83
Lesson     12
March 17-23


  Crisis Reveals Character

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Samuel 14:25-19:40.

SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "Lord, how are they increased that trouble
 PM   me! Many are they that rise up against me. Many there be which
      say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. But thou, 0
      Lord, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine
      head" (Psalm 3:1-3).

LEAN ON THE ARM OF POWER. In times of stress, rejection, or per-
sonal tragedy, the individual who leans wholly on the sustaining arm of the
Lord, and who harbors love and forgiveness in his or her heart grows
stronger in character and reveals to the universe the transforming power of
divine grace.

OUTLINE:
   I. Conspiracy and Revolt (2 Sam. 14:25-15:12).
  11. David's Exile (2 Sam. 15:13-16:14).
 I11. David's Friends (2 Sam. 15:19-29; 18:19-32; 19:24-40).
 IV. Absalom's Reign and Death (2 Sam. 16:15-18:18;
      18:33-19:7).
  V. David's Kingdom Restored (2 Sam. 19:8-39).

JUDGMENT CONTINUES TO FALL. Two qualities in David's char-
acter shine through the dark events that constitute this week's study: his
spirit of humility and forgiveness in the midst of revenge and treachery;
and his unwavering trust and confidence in the One in whom he found
shelter in times of crisis.
   David's sin brought a chain of events that occurred in rapid succession.
The sordid details of each new development are recorded to give the reader
a background for the next.
   The background to this week's lesson. Absalom had killed his half-
brother, Amnon, David's oldest son. David's second son (Chileab by Abi-
gail) had evidently died in infancy or early childhood. Now Absalom, as
the eldest living son, was the heir apparent to the throne, although no prec-
edent had been set in Israel as to the manner of choosing the next king.
David had not given any indication of his choice of a crown prince. But
there was no question that his third son, Absalom, had his eye on the
throne. David's refusal to see Absalom after his return to Jerusalem fueled
an already restless and ambitious spirit. The third part of David's fourfold
judgment was about to fall.

I. CONSPIRACY AND REVOLT (2 Sam. 14:25-15:12).

1. According to the following verses in 2 Samuel, what factors con-
   tributed to Absalom's popularity with the people?

   14:25, 26

   15:1

   15:2-4

   15:5, 6

    David loved his gifted son, yet felt he must show disapproval of his
crime. Now that Absalom was in Jerusalem his influence would be a threat
to David's security. Absalom's handsome appearance, his sister Tamar's
presence as a constant reminder of his brother's crime, and his own cun-
ning strategy to win the hearts of the people, combined to set the stage for
a revolt against his father's rule.
    "In the popular estimation, the prince was a hero rather than an of-
 fender."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 729.

2. How did Absalom make his demand to see the king's face? 2 Sam.
   14:28-33.



   Absalom assumed that he could command Joab. The personal assault on
his property, when Joab did not immediately respond, was a serious mat-
ter. The amazing thing is that the wily Joab tolerated such behavior, at
least for the time being. Absalom's challenge for the king to judge him
showed his impudence and lack of conscience regarding the crime he had
committed. The fact that David and Joab both meekly yielded to his wishes
gives a hint of his arrogance and highhandedness.
   As it turned out, the partial reconciliation between David and Absalom
was worse than no reconciliation at all, for it simply gave more credibility
to the scheming prince, who took advantage of David's negligence in the
administration of justice.
    "While the king was more and more inclined to desire retirement and
solitude, Absalom sedulously courted the popular favor."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, p. 729.

3. What steps did Absalom now take in his conspiracy to seize the
   throne? 2 Sam. 15:7-12. What shows that David did not suspect his
   scheme? Verse 9.



   Absalom was a skillful manipulator and deceiver. It took him four years
to win the hearts of the people and carefully lay his plans. (See 2 Sam.
15:7; the KJV says forty, but some ancient manuscripts read four. This is
                                                                          85
       Lesson 12                                                   March 23
      more accurate seeing that David reigned only 33 years in Jerusalem-
      1 Kings 2:11.) He gained the confidence of one of David's chief coun-
      selors, Ahithophel. The evidence indicates that he played on the discontent
      and bitterness that had resulted from David's fall. "The defection of
      Ahithophel, the ablest and most wily of political leaders, was prompted by
      revenge for the family disgrace involved in the wrong to Bathsheba, who
      was his granddaughter"—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 735.

         Do you agree that Absalom was a spoiled boy? How does parental
      permissiveness affect youth in the modern world? What kind of disci-
      pline would have contributed to the character development of Amnon
      and Absalom?

      11. DAVID'S EXILE (2 Sam. 15:13-16:14).

MON   4. Describe David's flight from Absalom. 2 Sam. 15:13-18.



          The revolt took David completely by surprise. There was nothing to do
      but flee, and there was only one way to go. To the north was the powerful
      tribe of Ephraim, and David did not know where their loyalties rested. He
      could not turn west to the Philistines. The strengthening forces of Absalom
      were coming from Hebron, to the south. David's only recourse was to head
      east for the wild and difficult terrain of the Transjordan. This territory
      would slow the progress of the untried men with Absalom.

      5. Contrast the picture of David in 2 Samuel 7:1 with that in
         2 Samuel 15:30 and 16:14. What brought about the change?



         Barefoot and humiliated, his royal robes replaced by sackcloth, David
      wrote Psalm 3 from the depths of his agony and sorrow. Yet in spite of the
      large numbers pursuing him, David could say with confidence,            lay
      down and slept; I awoke, for the Lord sustained me. I will not be afraid of
      ten thousands of people who have set themselves against me all around"
      (Ps. 3:5, 6, NKJV).

      6. What was David's response to the priests' carrying the ark of the
         covenant with them into exile? 2 Sam. 15:24-26.



         "As the priests turned back toward Jerusalem a deeper shadow fell
      upon the departing throng. Their king a fugitive, themselves outcasts, for-
      saken even by the ark of God—the future was dark with terror and fore-
      boding."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 735.

      7. What two incidents show how self-serving people took advantage
         of a crisis to vent their anger against David?
      86
 Crisis Reveals Character                                     March 23
  2 Sam. 16:1-4

  2 Sam. 16:5-13

   Shimei, a Benjamite and relative of Saul, displayed his anger against
the king. The rash Abishai, David's nephew and one of his officers, was
ready to execute Shimei on the spot, but David's spirit was one of humil-
ity and forgiveness toward his enemy. David may have written Psalm 7 on
this occasion or in memory of it.

   Compare David's attitude toward his enemies with Christ's atti-
tude. (See Isa. 53:7; Matt. 26:62, 63.) We tend to defend ourselves
when we are falsely accused. By what means can we control our defen-
sive feelings and angry words of retaliation?

I11. DAVID'S FRIENDS (2 Sam. 15:19-29; 18:19-32; 19:24-40).

8. How did one of David's friends show his support for the exiled
    king? 2 Sam. 15:19-23.



   The loyalty and fidelity of faithful friends at this time must have been a
bright spot in David's otherwise bleak situation. (See Prov. 17:17.) Ittai
and his 600 men, from the Philistine city of Gath, had converted to the He-
brew religion, and served as David's bodyguard. Ittai was one of the three
commanders who fought against Absalom. (See 2 Sam. 18:2.)

9. Upon hearing that Ahithophel had defected to Absalom, David
    prayed for God to defeat his counsel. How did God answer his
    prayer? 2 Sam. 15:31-37; 16:15-19; 17:1-14, 23.



10. Who served as David's informers? 2 Sam. 15:27, 28; 17:15-22.



11. How did some of David's friends in Gilead minister to him?
    2 Sam. 17:24, 27-29. (If possible, read this in a modern transla-
    tion.)

    Name the friends:

    Note the items they brought to David:



   Gilead was vulnerable to enemy attack. Because the rich land owners
of Gilead welcomed the protection of David and his men, they minis-
tered generously to their needs.
                                                                          87
       Lesson 12                                                    March 23
         David mustered his men at Mahanaim, former capital of Saul, and also
      of Ishbosheth during his short reign. Here, many years before, Jacob, flee-
      ing from his father-in-law, Laban, and about to meet his brother, Esau, met
      two groups of heavenly angels and called the place "two camps,"
      Mahanaim. (See Gen. 32:1, 2.) Now the Lord inspired faithful people to
      minister to the exiled king.

      12. How did David later show his gratitude to Barzillai for his loyal
          support? 2 Sam. 19:31-39.



         How good it is to have loyal friends who give encouragement and
      support in difficult times. Can you share the blessings you have re-
      ceived from loving friends when you were suffering hardship?

WED   IV. ABSALOM'S REIGN AND DEATH (2 Sam. 16:15-18:18; 18:33-
          19:7).

         Part of Nathan's prophecy against David was that, although he had
      sinned secretly, he would be publicly disgraced. Ahithophel now became
      the instigator for the fulfillment of that prophecy. Concern for his own
      safety, should there be a reconciliation between David and Absalom at
      some future time, must have prompted him to advise Absalom to pursue
      such a heinous course of action. (See Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 739.)
      Absalom now burned his bridges behind him by taking over the royal
      harem. (See 2 Sam. 16:20-23.)

      13. Note David's preparations for the battle against Absalom. 2 Sam.
          18:1-5. What indicates the people's love and concern for their
          king? Verse 3. What instructions did David give concerning the
          treatment of Absalom? Verse 5.



        As any parent might well understand, David's natural feelings of love
      and pity for his rebellious son outweighed his good judgment as king.
      Should Absalom escape and live, the throne would never be safe. Joab rec-
      ognized that there was not room for two kings.

      14. How did the rugged, wooded terrain of the countryside aid
          David's cause? 2 Sam. 18:6-8. How was Absalom's death brought
          about? Verses 9-15.



         Twice Joab had been instrumental in bringing about a reconciliation be-
      tween David and Absalom. But his trust had been breached and shamelessly
      betrayed. Now despite David's parting counsel, Joab had no scruples. There
      was only one way to deal with the instigator of all this evil. With one blow
      the rebellion was over. Joab blew the trumpet to announce the news.
      88
      Crisis Reveals Character                                    March 23
     15. Whom did Joab send to David to deliver the news of Absalom's
         death? How can we explain the subsequent incident. 2 Sam.
         18:19-32.



        This intriguing incident suggests the dilemma of the situation. The
     battle was over. David's forces had been victorious and His throne had
     been saved. But Joab knew that the good news of victory would be bad
     news for David. Just why Joab preferred the Cushite to Ahimaaz to take
     the report to David, and why the latter was so eager to do so, is not clear.
     Upon arriving, Ahimaaz was not sure how to break the news.


si   16. What was David's reaction to the news of Absalom's death?
         2 Sam. 18:33; 19:1-4. What does Joab's reprimand (verses 5-7)
         and David's response (verse 8) reveal about the following?

         David

         Joab

         The people

        David's sorrow was intense. He had lost another son as a result of his
     own sin. Yet as king he was responsible to his people. For David to nurse
     his own grief when his people had risked so much to save his throne
     angered the rude, blunt Joab. David seemed not to resent his harsh reproof
     and promptly went to the city gate to welcome and encourage his subjects.

        How would you comfort a parent whose child had died because of
     the child's own foolishness? Would you rebuke the parent for failing
     to train the child correctly? Would you excuse the sin of the child?
     What would you say?

     V. DAVID'S KINGDOM RESTORED (2 Sam. 19:8-39).

     17. What was one of the first actions David took after resuming the
         kingship? 2 Sam. 19:13.



        Amasa, David's nephew, had been Absalom's military leader. His ap-
     pointment as David's new commander-in-chief would assure the loyalty of
     Absalom's followers. David acted decisively, regardless of whether he
     was motivated politically or by his desire to be rid of Joab's overbearing
     personality.

     18. After David's restoration to the kingship (2 Sam. 19:15-18), what
         were his dealings with the following people? What do his
         decisions reveal about his character?

                                                                               89
 Lesson 12                                                        March 23
     Shimei (v. 23)

     Ziba (v. 29)

     Mephibosheth (vs. 26-30)

   David had learned well the lesson that one cannot enjoy the mercy and
forgiveness of God without extending it to others.

ASK YOURSELF:
   • If I had been in David's place how would I have dealt with Shimei,
Joab, and Amasa?
   • Do I rally to my friends when they are in trouble, or do I tend to
avoid them because I do not want to get involved?
   • How do I react when I am unjustly treated? Do I humbly forgive or
do I seek revenge?

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read the chapter entitled
"The Rebellion of Absalom" in Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 727-745.
Read Psalms 42 and 84, keeping in mind David's experiences.

SUMMARY: God never forsakes us, even when the dark chapters in our
experience result from our own mistakes. We need the same tenacious
faith and trust in God that carried David through his crises. The sure mer-
cies of David may be ours as we pass through our dark valleys.

              Overshadowing
               Providence
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Samuel 20-24.

SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "The Spirit of the Lord spake by me, and his
PM    word was in my tongue. The God of Israel said, the Rock of Is-
      rael spake to me, He that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in
      the fear of God" (2 Samuel 23:2, 3).

GOD'S LOVE MORE THAN ADEQUATE. The record of David's life
serves to remind us that no matter how tangled our lives, or how far we
have fallen from God's plan for us, or how bitter our circumstances, God's
love and mercy are greater than our sin. His salvation is broader than our
need.

OUTLINE:
   I. The Troubled Closing Years of David (2 Sam. 20:1-21:14).
  11. David's Accomplishments (2 Sam. 21:15-22; 23:8-24:25).
 I11. David the Psalmist (2 Samuel 22).
 IV. David the Prophet (2 Sam. 23:1-7).
  V. Lessons From David.

THE CLOSING DAYS OF DAVID'S REIGN. In this last lesson dealing
with the books of Samuel, we catch several glimpses into some of the clos-
ing events of David's reign. The last few chapters of 2 Samuel appear to
be miscellaneous accounts that did not fit chronologically into the main
story, but were added as part of the record. It is probable, however, that
most of them took place in David's latter years.
   It is important to emphasize that the brutal and bloodthirsty nature of
some Bible accounts is no reflection on the character of God. The actions
of the supposed children of God were not an accurate reflection of God's
will and intentions. We must be careful not to blame God for the faulty be-
havior of His professed children.
   We will note some of David's accomplishments, his last words, and
more important, we will look into the very heart of David, the prophet, as
we read and study some of his inspired songs and prayers. In addition to
being the most esteemed king in Israel's history and the forerunner of the
Messiah, David's gift of prophecy has blessed the world with some of the
greatest poetry and music of all time.
    Finally, in retrospect, we will review some of the main lessons we have
observed in our study of this great man of God.

                                                                        91
 Lesson 13                                                   March 30
I. THE TROUBLED CLOSING YEARS OF DAVID (2 Sam. 20:1-
   21:14).

1. Who was Amasa? 2 Sam. 17:25. What may have prompted David to
   promote him to commander-in-chief of his army? 2 Sam. 19:11-13
   (see also verses 5-7).



   David's anger at Joab for killing Absalom was surpassed only by his
grief for his dead son. Joab's sharp reproof of the grieving king must have
rankled in his heart, although at the time David humbly yielded to his com-
mander's advice. Now he had taken enough from the wily Joab. In a daring
move, the king made his nephew and former enemy the commander of his
forces in Joab's place.

2. What circumstances necessitated David's mustering his military
   forces again? 2 Sam. 20:1, 2. To whom did he give orders? How
   did Joab react to these changes? Verses 4-10.



   Joab was a murderer, despite his great capacity as a military leader.
David owed much to Joab's ability to organize and lead an army. This
probably explains why David tolerated his sometimes violent behavior.
But such behavior is totally contrary to principles of God's government.
Mercy, love, forgiveness, and gentleness characterize the Lord's rule. Joab
was a man of action, a man of insight and wisdom (see 2 Sam. 20:16-22)
but he failed to take on the character of God. There are times when the ex-
ercise of might is anything but right.

3. To what did David attribute the three-year famine in Israel?
   2 Sam. 21:1-3.



    In the days of Joshua and the conquest of Canaan, the Gibeonites had
practiced deception to save themselves from destruction. Joshua and the
people of Israel had entered into a solemn agreement with them, and were
bound to honor their promise to allow the Gibeonites to live among them
peaceably. (See Joshua 9:3-27.) Evidently Saul, with the support of his
people, had put many of them to death, for what might be described as
racist reasons. This is why the whole nation was now suffering a famine
(2 Sam. 21:1).
   "The whole nation was involved in the violation of the solemn oath
given by Joshua and the princes of the congregation more than 400 years
before. . . .

   "Wherewith shall I make the atonement? David should have
addressed this question to God, even as he had addressed the previous in-
quiry concerning the cause of the famine. The record does not state that
92
       Overshadowing Providence                                      March 30
      David took this matter to the Lord, nor does it affirm that what the
      Gibeonites demanded and what David carried out in response was in har-
      mony with what God would have required in order to rectify the situa-
      tion."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2, p. 695.

      4. How did David once more show respect for the memory of Saul?
         2 Sam. 21:10-14.



         "Because the text states that 'God was intreated' we need not therefore
      conclude that David had followed God's plan for atoning for Saul's evil
      deed. The Lord might measure an act by the sincerity of heart that
      prompted it, even though he condemned the act itself."—SDA Bible Com-
      mentary, vol. 2, p. 697.

MON   11. DAVID'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS (2 Sam. 21:15-22; 23:8-24:25).

         David's Hall of Fame lists an impressive number of great men, warri-
      ors, and statesmen, who made their contributions to Israel's military victo-
      ries and political strength in this the most glorious period of their history.
      (See 2 Sam. 20:23-26; 23:8-39.) David and his men manifested mutual
      love and loyalty. (See 2 Sam. 23:13-17.)

      5. How did David's military accomplishments become a snare to him
         and his people? 2 Sam. 24:1-9.



         Pride provoked a display of power. "With a view to extending his
      conquests among foreign nations, David determined to increase his army
      by requiring military service from all who were of proper age. To effect
      this, it became necessary to take a census of the population. It was pride
      and ambition that prompted this action of the king. The numbering of the
      people would show the contrast between the weakness of the kingdom
      when David ascended the throne and its strength and prosperity under his
      rule. This would tend still further to foster the already too great self-
      confidence of both king and people."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 747.

         Two descriptions of the same event. The record in 2 Samuel 24:1 sug-
      gests that God's anger against Israel moved David to number them, while
      the parallel account in 1 Chronicles 21:1 says that Satan provoked David
      to do it. "These statements are not necessarily contradictory but may
      simply represent two aspects of the same incident. In the verse under con-
      sideration we have another instance where God is said to do that which He
      does not prevent."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2, p. 710.
         Israel's pride resulted in withdrawal of God's protecting hand and the
      evil one tempted David to an act that was contrary to God's will.

      6. What was David's reaction to the prophet Gad's censure and the
         consequent punishment? 2 Sam. 24:10-25.
                                                                                 93
 Lesson 13                                                   March 30
   On Mt. Moriah, the very spot where Abraham had built an altar upon
which to sacrifice his son, David now erected another altar to com-
memorate the great deliverance and staying of the destroying angel. There
his son Solomon would build the glorious Temple that he himself had
desired to build.

7. Though not mentioned in the Samuel account, what were some of
   David's other accomplishments?

   a. He made "abundant preparations" for the building of the Temple.
1 Chron. 22:1-5.
   b. He organized the Temple service. 1 Chron. 23:2-6.
   c. He developed Israel's music. In addition to organizing musicians (see
1 Chron. 25:1-6) and creating musical instruments (1 Chron. 23:5), he
composed many songs and edited the Hebrew hymn book, the Psalter.

   David's experience illustrates the principle that when we obey the
Lord we are blessed, but when we disobey He withdraws His protec-
tion and we suffer. What experiences in your life illustrate the same
principle?

I11. DAVID THE PSALMIST (2 Samuel 22).

   Although a study of Psalms is beyond the scope of this lesson, our re-
view of David's life would not be complete without a look at a sampling
of his great hymns, which have blessed the world through the centuries.
   The Psalm of Thanksgiving, recorded in 2 Samuel 22, also occurs as
Psalm 18. Examining some of the aspects of this hymn of praise may give
us a greater appreciation and understanding of David's other psalms.

8. Make a list of the names or figures used in 2 Samuel 22 that David
   used to refer to God, noting how many have gospel significance.




9. Review the events of Lesson 7 as a means of understanding the
   psalmist's distress over his enemies. How would you evaluate his
   description in 2 Samuel 22:5-7, 17-20?



   In the middle of his prayer of distress over his enemies, David portrays
in vivid and powerful detail an encounter with the living God. (See 2 Sam.
22:8-16.) It is as though the psalmist is quieting his own fears by remind-
ing himself of the awful majesty and greatness of his God, who is his
defense.

94
       Overshadowing Providence                                     March 30
      10. Read 2 Samuel 22:35-43 in light of the principles of the great
          controversy between Christ and Satan. (See Rev. 12:1-17.) How
          would you explain the following?

         "He teaches my hands to make war" (2 Sam. 22:35, NKJV; see Eph.
      6:10-17).



        "You have subdued . . . those who rose against me" (2 Sam. 22:40,
      NKJV; see Rev. 12:9-11).



          "I beat them as fine as the dust of the earth" (2 Sam. 22:43, NKJV;
      see Ps. 2:8, 9; Rev. 19:15).



WED   11. Summarize in your own words some of the reasons David had
          for being grateful:

          2 Sam. 22:20, 44

          Verses 26-28

          Verses 29-31

          Verses 36, 37

          Verses 50, 51

         Deitrich Bonhoeffer, who spent the last years of his life in a Nazi prison
      camp and eventually became a martyr, loved and read the psalms daily. A
      friend who was with him in his last days said that he seemed to diffuse
      happiness and joy to those about him, and manifested a deep sense of grati-
      tude over just being alive. He had learned well the lesson of the psalmist:
      gratitude born of adversity sings God's praises from the heart, not just with
      the lips.

      IV. DAVID THE PROPHET (2 Sam. 23:1-7).

      12. What New Testament criteria confirms David's prophetic gift?
          Who was the "Rock of Israel" who spoke to him (2 Sam. 23:1-
          3)? 2 Peter 1:21; 1 Cor. 10:4.



      13. Study the following sampling of the prophecies made by David
          about the Messiah to come. Compare their New Testament fulfill-
          ment.
                                                                                95
 Lesson 13                                                   March 30
     Prophecy                            Fulfillment

     Ps. 89:3, 4                         Luke 1:31-33
     Ps. 118:25, 26                      Matt. 21:9
     Ps. 22:1                            Matt. 27:46
     Ps. 22:7, 8                         Matt. 27:39-43

14. How does David describe the second advent of Christ to this
    earth? Ps. 50:1-3 (compare Ps. 97:3-6; 2 Thess. 2:8).



   With what awe and holy anticipation the prophet must have looked
down the corridor of the centuries to the glorious appearing of his God in
majesty and splendor. The sublime presence of the living Lord, Yahweh,
Israel's King (Ps. 97:1; 99:1), deserves worship from "all his saints" (Ps.
148:14), from all nations (Ps. 102:15), and from all creatures (Ps. 150:6).

15. What two aspects of judgment does the psalmist emphasize? Ps.
    94:1-3; 98:2, 3.



   A persistent theme in the Psalms is that the "Judge of the earth" to
whom vengeance belongs, will "render punishment" to the proud and to
those who do evil. But with equal fervor the psalmist reminds us that jus-
tice has another side—mercy and equity to the poor and oppressed, along
with salvation and faithfulness to the "house of Israel" (Ps. 98:3).

V. LESSONS FROM DAVID.

    We have abhorred David's inconsistencies and admired his virtues.
What made David the truly great man that he was? What earned him the
title, "A man after God's own heart"?

Consider the following glimpses into the qualities of David's relation-
ship with God as seen in the psalms:

     a. Singleness of purpose, Ps. 27:4, 8
     b. Repentant spirit, Ps. 32:5
     c. Trust in God's mercy and salvation, Ps. 13:5
     d. Trust in God's power, Ps. 56:3, 4; 60:11
     e. Trust in God's plan, Ps. 37:23-29
     f. Patiently waiting on the Lord, Ps. 27:14; 37:7
     g. Teachability, Ps. 25:4, 5
     h. Awareness of God's presence, Ps. 16:8
     i. Thirst for God, Ps. 42:1, 2
     j. Enjoyment of God, Ps. 16:11; 17:15; 34:8

   Meditate on the contrasts between the life of Saul, the first king of
Israel, and David. Compare their failures and mistakes. What made the
96
 Overshadowing Providence                                     March 30
difference in the way God dealt with these two men?

   Picture the judgment scene in the heavenly sanctuary. Angels sur-
round the Father's throne. Christ is at His right hand. The book of life is
open, and on one of its pages appears the name of David. An angel near
the throne holds his personal record book. Suddenly a voice in the distance
cries out, "Unfair, Unfair! How can you justify saving David? Look at his
sins!" The angry accuser (Rev. 12:10) demands an accounting.
   Slowly the angel leafs through David's personal record book. Across
every sin is written in large bold letters, "Confessed, forgiven!" Jesus, the
son of David, the Messiah King, steps forward. Holding out His nail-
pierced hands, and in a voice melodious with deep emotion, He says, "My
blood was shed for David's sins. I have paid the ransom price for his sal-
vation. He accepted My transforming grace. I will not blot out his name
from the book of life, but I will confess his name before My Father and
before His angels. (See Rev. 3:5.) There is a long hushed silence. The ac-
cuser leaves, speechless. Suddenly a choir of angels bursts into song:
       " 'Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
       To receive power and riches and wisdom,
       And strength and honor and glory and blessing' " (Rev. 5:12,
       NKJV).
    Now reread this scene, substituting your name for David's.

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read the chapter entitled
"The Last Years of David" in Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 746-755. Leaf
through the previous twelve studies of this quarter, noting the examples or
warnings that stand out in your mind as especially helpful. Make a list of
the principles you hope to remember and apply in your own life, and those
that may benefit the church as a whole.

SUMMARY: Whatever difficulties we may face in the future, no matter
what afflictions we may be called on to endure, the God of David is still
our God today. Through Him we may do valiantly. (See Ps. 60:12.)

     Lessons for Second Quarter, 1991

    Sabbath School members who have not received a copy of the Adult Lessons
for the second quarter of 1991 will be helped by the following outline in studying
the first two lessons. The title of the series is Rainbow in the Rain. This quarter's
lessons cover the book of Ezekiel.

First Lesson: "When Tragedy Strikes"
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ezekiel 1:1-3; 2:1-5; 3:15; 24:1, 16.

MEMORY TEXT: James 5:10.
TRAGEDY IS NO RESPECTER OF PERSONS. Is it more important
to know why adversity comes, or to know how to relate to it in a positive
manner? Can God's grace overrule grief for our good and the salvation of
others?
OUTLINE:
   I. Ezekiel and His Times (2 Kings 21-25).
  H. Ezekiel's Triple Tragedies (Eze. 1:1-3; 3:15; 24:1, 16).
