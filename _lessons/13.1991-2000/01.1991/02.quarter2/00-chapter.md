                     Messages From Ezekiel

        Rainbow in the Rain
   "There was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like sapphire; and
seated above the likeness of a throne was a likeness as it were of a human
form. . . . I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness
round about him. Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the
day of rain. . . . Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the
Lord" (Eze. 1:26-28, RSV).
   The traveler peered apprehensively through the window of the jetliner
as it hurtled northward. The sun blazed, flashing its brilliance into the cabin
in marked contrast to the enormous rain clouds billowing up from below.
    Suddenly, through nature's alchemy of light and moisture, a 360-degree
rainbow imaged itself upon the clouds, moving in swift tandem with the
aircraft. As the traveler gazed at the glowing phenomenon, he became aware
that the sun's angle caused the jetliner's shadow to lie within the protect-
ing circle of the bow! As the one moved, so moved the other. "Thank You,
Lord," the traveler whispered, "we are never outside the circle of Your
care."
    A vision of the Lord, enthroned in fiery majesty and encircled by a rain-
bow, gave young Ezekiel courage to face the rigors of captivity in Babylonia
in the sixth century B.C. A contemporary of both Jeremiah and Daniel,
Ezekiel was called to prophetic ministry among the hardened and dis-
couraged Jewish exiles. Faithful in reproof, yet ever upholding the divine
promises that are as certain as God Himself, Ezekiel unselfishly labored to
keep the flame of the true faith alive. His experience and messages continue
to counsel and assure God's people today.
   O Joy that seekest me through pain,
   I cannot close my heart to Thee;
   I trace the rainbow through the rain,
   And feel the promise is not vain,
   That morn shall tearless be!
   —George Matheson, "0 Love, That Will Not Let Me Go."

      When Tragedy Strikes

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ezekiel 1:1-3; 2:1-5; 3:15; 24:1, 16.
SAB
 PM   MEMORY TEXT: "Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have
      spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering af-
      fliction, and of patience" (James 5:10).

TRAGEDY IS NO RESPECTER OF PERSONS. It is a fact of human
existence in a sin-warped world. Is it more important to know why adver-
sity comes, or to know how to relate to it in a positive manner? Can God's
grace overrule tragedy for our good and the salvation of others?

OUTLINE:
   I. Ezekiel and His Times (2 Kings 21-25).
  11. Ezekiel and His Tragedies (Eze. 1:1-3; 3:15; 24:1, 16).
 I11. Ezekiel and His Ministry (Eze. 2:1-5).

GRACE TO BEAR SUFFERING. On Monday morning, June 13, 1988,
10-year-old Katrina Ferguson stood beside her mother in the driveway of
her home, eagerly awaiting the school bus. Suddenly an approaching car
veered across the road and struck Katrina. A sleeping drunk slumped at the
wheel. "He just came toward us," sobbed her mother. "I screamed . . . but
before I could grab her away, the car picked her up and dragged her . . .
and there she was lying on the road. I ran over to her and grabbed her in
my arms. It knocked the little ribbons out of her hair." Katrina was pro-
nounced dead at Prince William Hospital in Manassas, Virginia.—From
the Washington Post, June 14, 1988.
   Suffering is our lot. The tragedy that befell the Ferguson family
could be multiplied many times over. The great moral controversy be-
tween God and Satan explains its presence in the earth. The ultimate
reason for human suffering is that Lucifer rebelled against God, bringing
sin, misery, and death into the universe. We cannot always avoid adver-
sity, but God has promised sustaining grace to bear it. (See 1 Cor.
10:13.) When we relate to the tragedies of life trusting in the overruling
providence of God, He makes us stronger people, more able to minister
to the needs of others.
   The prophet Ezekiel provides an example of one of God's children who
suffered a series of tragedies affecting his entire adult life. But, in spite of
terrible loss, his loyalty and steadfast witness to God kept the flame of
truth burning throughout Judah's captivity in Babylon.

     I. EZEKIEL AND HIS TIMES (2 Kings 21-25).

     1. At what point in Jewish history does Ezekiel begin the sketch of
        his life and ministry? What was the spiritual climate of the times?
        Eze. 1:1 2 (compare 2 Kings 21; Jer. 15:4).


         Note: Throughout the quarterly references in parentheses after ques-
     tions are for further study by those interested in additional information.


IN      The book of Ezekiel is an autobiography the purpose of which is to in-
     form, inspire, and warn the reader. Ezekiel lived during the reigns of the
     last five kings of Judah. Three were sons of Josiah; one was his grandson.
     See the chart below:


      Josiah (639-609 B.C.)         Grandson of Manasseh
      Jehoahaz (609 B.C.)           Son of Josiah              Reigned 3 months
      Jehoiakim (609-598 B.C.)      Son of Josiah              Reigned 11 years
      Jehoiachin (598-597 B.C.)     Grandson of Josiah         Reigned 3 months
       [Jeconiah, Coniah]
      Zedekiah (597-586 B.C.)       Son of Josiah              Reigned 11 years


        Revival and renewed apostasy. When Josiah began his reign at the age
     of 8 (2 Kings 22: I), the nation of Judah was spiritually bankrupt. The
     young king's grandfather, Manasseh, had "seduced . . . [the people] to do
     more evil than did the nations whom the Lord destroyed before the child-
     ren of Israel - (2 Kings 21:9). As early as Josiah's twelfth year, when he
     was 20 years of age, he began in earnest to revive and reform the sinful na-
     tion (2 Chron. 34:3). Priestly endeavors to refurbish the Temple led to the
     discovery of a copy of the book of the law written by Moses. The message
     of the book resulted in national renewal of the covenant relationship with
     God. (See 2 Kings 23.) A revival of true faith broke out as the people
     joined with their king in breaking down the altars and images.
         But the widespread revival was superficial. (See Jer. 3:10.) Its momen-
     tum vanished with Josiah's untimely death. The people resumed the
     idolatrous practices into which they had fallen during the days of Manas-
     seh. God saw that only the furnace of affliction—the discipline of captiv-
     ity—could cure this national passion for the gods and sins of paganism. So
     He permitted the scourge of the Babylonian invasion and captivity to fall
     upon the sinful nation. (See Jer. 15:4.)
          It is generally agreed that the figure 30 (Eze. 1:1) refers to the prophet's
     age. Ezekiel was one of 10,000 Jews—leading citizens, military personnel,
     artisans, along with Jehoiachin and his court—whom Nebuchadnezzar re-
     moved to Babylonia in 597 B.C. (See 2 Kings 24:10-16.)

     2. Who were Ezekiel's contemporaries at this critical time in Jewish
        history? Jer. 1:1, 2; Dan. 1:1-6 (compare Zeph. 1:1; Hab. 1:6;
        2 Kings 22:3, 8-20).
                                                                        7

      3. What reason did God give for uprooting and exiling Israelites to
         Babylon? Jer. 30:11-15. How might your present, personal trials
         be understood in the light of what befell the 10,000 exiles?



MON   11. EZEKIEL AND HIS TRAGEDIES (Eze. 1:1-3; 3:15; 24:1, 16).

      4. How does Ezekiel refer to the tragedy that befell him as a young
         man and altered the course of his life? Eze. 1:1; 3:15.



         Notice how the military conquest of Judah by idolaters affected Ezekiel,
      who had been taught to trust in God's protection.
         "Ezekiel was weighed down with sorrowful memories and troubled
      forebodings. The land of his fathers was desolate. Jerusalem was depopu-
      lated. The prophet himself was a stranger in a land where ambition and
      cruelty reigned supreme. As on every hand he beheld tyranny and wrong, his
      soul was distressed, and he mourned day and night."—Education, p. 177.

      5. How did the Babylonians taunt their Jewish captives about the
         weakness of their God to deliver them from the Chaldean armies?
         Eze. 36:17-20 (compare Jer. 33:24; Ps. 137:1-4).



         "The conduct and attendant miseries of the Israelites dishonored Je-
      hovah in the sight of the heathen, who naturally inferred that if this was all
      that the God of Israel could do for His devotees, He was no better than
      their own gods. The heathen regarded Jehovah merely as the national God
      of the Israelites."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, pp. 696, 697.



      6. What specific counsel did the Lord instruct Jeremiah to write to
         the 10,000 captives? Why would this message deepen Ezekiel's
         depression? Jer. 29:1-14. Note particularly verse 10.



         Considerable unrest existed among the captives in Babylon. The
      general expectation was that they would soon be released. In order to avoid
      harsh oppression by their captors, it was essential that the captives accept
      their new situation and settle down, living useful lives and maintaining the
      race. Seventy years were to elapse before God would bring about the
      events that would restore the nation. We can only imagine the devastating
      effect this message would have on 30-year-old Ezekiel. He would be in
      exile for a lifetime. He would never see his Judean homeland again.

         The Jewish captives were not enslaved by the Babylonians. Ap-
                                                                                   9
        Lesson 1                                                          April 6
      parently they were allotted living areas and could build their own homes,
      plant gardens, and organize their social activities under the oversight of
      their elders. Ezekiel had his own home. It is evident that it became a cen-
      ter to which the Jewish elders repaired to discover what God would reveal
      to the prophet. (See Eze. 8:1; 14:1; 20:1.)


El    7. For what lifework had Ezekiel trained in Judah? Eze. 1:3. At what
         age would he have entered this special ministry? Num. 4:3; 8:24.



         Ezekiel identifies himself as "Ezekiel the priest." Like Jeremiah, he
      was of the house of Aaron and had grown up in a priestly family. This
      meant that he had been trained for this sacred office. No doubt his parents
      had kept the high ideal of the priesthood constantly before him as he
      studied to follow in his father's footsteps. But the captivity effectively de-
      stroyed his career and terminated his dreams of holy service for his God
      and his people in the sacred precincts of Solomon's Temple. We can im-
      agine his bitter disappointment at being thwarted from his passion to be a
      priest; but Ezekiel kept his personal heartache hidden from his readers.

         A mature age. "In ch. 8:23-26 the age is given as between 25 and 50
      years. Later writers record a further adjustment, attributed to David, begin-
      ning the service at 20 years of age (1 Chron. 23:24, 27; 2 Chron. 31:17;
      Ezra 3:8). . . . The first injunction, giving the beginning age as 30 years
      [Num. 4:3], may have been a temporary measure. Thirty years marked the
      age at which a Jew was considered mature and ready to assume all the re-
      sponsibilities of his rights and privileges (cf. Luke 3:23)."—SDA Bible
      Commentary, vol. 1, p. 838.

      8. What terrible event happened in Ezekiel's home a few years after
         his call to prophetic office? Eze. 24:1, 2, 15-18. What does the ex-
         pression "the desire of thine eyes" suggest?



          Ezekiel places this third tragedy in the ninth year of Jehoiachin's captiv-
      ity, in the tenth day of the tenth month. (Compare 2 Kings 25:1.) This date
      also marked the beginning of Nebuchadnezzar's final siege of Jerusalem
      (589/588 B.C.). The siege would last for months, and the Egyptians would
      try to break it for their Jewish allies. (See Jer. 37:7.) But eventually the
      Babylonians would raze the city and its Temple and deport its defenders.
          For the prophet the sudden death of his wife announced the final de-
      struction of Jerusalem with the Temple. The expression "the desire of
      thine eyes" emphasizes not only her beauty but the prophet's deep love for
      her and the tender ties that linked them together.

WED    9. What message did God convey to the Jews in captivity through
          the sudden death of Ezekiel's wife? Why was Ezekiel not per-
          mitted to show any signs of public grief? Eze. 24:18-24.

      10
      When Tragedy Strikes                                              April 6
        Suffering without bitterness. As a devoted follower of God, Ezekiel
    had to face up to a series of bitter experiences: removal from his homeland,
    lifelong captivity in a foreign land where he was subjected to continuous
    mockery, the loss of a priestly career for which he had trained for years,
    the sudden death of his beloved wife and companion, and the destruction
    of the Temple. Any one of these was sufficient to have embittered him for
    the rest of his life. But Ezekiel did not succumb to bitterness and cynicism.

      How can a Christian experience sorrow and tragedy without be-
    coming bitter or overwhelmed? (See Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 488.)

    I11. EZEKIEL AND HIS MINISTRY (Eze. 2:1-5).

       It is not God's plan to leave His servants to wallow in their pain—real
    though it be—or to give themselves over to self-pity. He has a role for
    them to fulfill, a task for them to perform in their sphere of life. In follow-
    ing God's leading, the Christian finds the Lord overruling his tragedies in
    a marvelous way to work all things together for good (Rom. 8:28).

    10. What assignment did God have for Ezekiel in captivity? What
        does the expression "son of man" mean? Why would God ad-
        dress Ezekiel in this manner? Eze. 2:1-5 (compare Dan. 8:17).



       Part of Ezekiel's success in communicating with the exiles would lie in
    the common ground he shared with them. As a human being and a captive,
    he was sharing in their distress, and he had a word from the Lord for them.
    The expression "son of man" identified the prophet with his people.

Ni 11. What was the general attitude of the captives toward God and
         spiritual things? List the terms by which God describes the con-
         dition of His people at this time. Eze. 2:3, 4, 6.



        "Ezekiel lay on no bed of roses. His messages of stern denunciation
     raised up enemies who gave him worse than a thorny couch—a very house
     of scorpions to dwell in. No more hideous picture of distress can well be
     conceived than that of the faithful prophet thrust into a thicket of briars,
     which turns out to be a scorpion's nest."—H. D. M. Spence, ed., Pulpit
     Commentary, Homiletics, on Ezekiel 2:6, vol. 27, p. 54.

     12. If the Jewish captives were so spiritually hardened against God's
         endeavors to save them, why did He commission Ezekiel to work
         with them at all? Compare Eze. 2:5 with 3:17-21.



        Apostasy from the faith of Abraham and Moses was the trend of that
     day among the Jews. Yet the hope of the nation lay with exiles taken in the
                                                                                11
       Lesson 1                                                         April 6
      second deportation. These were the "good" figs of Jeremiah's vision
      (Jeremiah 24). The Babylonian captivity, permitted by God to discipline
      His people, could have marked the demise of the Jewish religion. Although
      most of the exiles were idolaters and were now directly surrounded by
      pagan influences, God saw that a remnant would respond to Ezekiel's min-
      istry and one day would return to renew the nation.

      13. What strange physical phenomenon affected Ezekiel except when
          he was under the control of the Holy Spirit? Eze. 3:26, 27 (com-
          pare 24:25-27; 33:21, 22). In what way would this phenomenon
          strengthen the prophet's message; or was it simply another per-
          sonal tragedy?



      14. How did the exiles regard Ezekiel's witness? Eze. 33:30-33.



         "In this life our work for God often seems to be almost fruitless. Our
      efforts to do good may be earnest and persevering, yet we may not be per-
      mitted to witness their results. To us the effort may seem to be lost. But the
      Saviour assures us that our work is noted in heaven, and that the recom-
      pense cannot fail."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 305.

      HOW DO I RELATE TO LIFE'S DISAPPOINTMENTS?
         • How can I as a Christian prepare for sudden tragedy in my life? (See
      Ps. 112:7.)
         • Many persons have been forced to change job careers by unforeseen
      circumstances. Why is this difficult experience not necessarily a bad thing?
         • How do the problems I encounter enable me to meet greater crises
      that may come?
         • Do my reactions to life's heartaches attract others to Christ or lead
      them away from Him?

      FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read Steps to Christ, "Re-
ua our
   joicing in the Lord," pp. 115-126. Consider the following assurances that
       best efforts for the Lord are not forgotten: Gal. 6:9; Ps. 126:5, 6; Dan.
      12:3; Matt. 10:41, 42; Eph. 6:8.

      SUMMARY: In our human situation, tragedies and difficulties often beset
      us. God has not promised "skies always blue." We may let our trials crush
      and embitter us, or we may, by God's grace, relate to them in such a man-
      ner as to mature in faith and trust. We may identify with stricken Ezekiel
      and, like him, find a useful place in service for our fellow human beings.

      MEMORY TEXT: "Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord God;
      Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and al-
      though I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be
      to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall
      come" (Ezekiel 11:16).

GOD'S LOVING CONCERN. How can we know that God has not aban-
doned His people when circumstances seem to indicate such? How can we
know that we are safe and secure when the evidence of our senses suggests
otherwise? What comforting assurance can you give to faithful people who
seem to have so many "afflictions"? (Ps. 34:19).

A SHELTER IN A TIME OF STORM. An angry Atlantic hurricane,
packing winds as high as 200 miles per hour, swept along the northeastern
coast of the United States—"the richest industrialized seaboard in the
world"—before it slammed ashore in Rhode Island in September, 1938.
Nature's dark storm seemed like a prelude to World War II, that horrible
conflict that plunged so many nations into its maelstrom.
   The Babylonian invasions that struck the nation of Judah in the sixth
century B.C. were like the strikes of a great killer hurricane. (See Jer. 4:13,
19, 20.) The prophets had long warned Judah of coming troubles and ap-
pealed to the nation to repent. In like manner the prophetic Scriptures ap-
peal to end-time Christians to prepare for the storm that is coming. Few in
Judah paid any attention to the prophets. How is it with modern Chris-
tians?
   In today's lesson we see how God reassures those who seek His con-
tinued presence, even though they suffer.

I. GOD'S PRESENCE IN THE STORM (Eze. 1:4, 26-28).

1. While in vision, what did Ezekiel see advancing rapidly toward
                                                                            13
       Lesson 2                                                     April 13
           him? Eze. 1:3, 4. What- significance did the vision have on his
           thinking?



         Storm clouds and fierce winds rushing out of the north toward Ezekiel
      matched his gloomy thoughts. "North" was the direction from which the
      Babylonian armies invaded Judah. However Ezekiel and his fellow cap-
      tives were living at Telabib, south of the city of Babylon. Were only the
      Jews in the eye of the whirlwind? Was this a sign that more was coming?

      2. When the black, threatening thundercloud swirled closer, what
         strange things did Ezekiel see? How would this sight have affected
         him? Eze. 1:4, 5, 26-28.



         This surprising vision of God enthroned beneath the arch of a radiant
      rainbow must have encouraged Ezekiel to believe that all was not lost.
      (Compare Rev. 4:3.) The God of heaven still reigned and would eventu-
      ally carry out His purposes for Israel in spite of human failure on the one
      hand and human cruelty on the other.
         "The wonderful symbols presented before him beside the river Chebar
      revealed an overruling power mightier than that of earthly rulers. Above
      the proud and cruel monarchs of Assyria and Babylon the God of mercy
      and truth was enthroned."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 752.

      3. As one trained to be a priest, Ezekiel would know that God's spe-
         cial dwelling place was located where in the Temple? Ex. 25:22;
         2 Sam. 6:2. According to Ezekiel 10:8, 9, who were the living crea-
         tures who supported and moved God's throne in the vision in
         Ezekiel 1? What message would a vision of God's leaving the
         Temple convey to Ezekiel and the other captives in Babylon?



          Ezekiel's striking vision would have conveyed to the prophet more than
      the fact that God had abandoned the Temple in Jerusalem. As we shall see,
      God was in transit to sit in judgment on the sin-hardened incorrigibles in
      Judah. The vision would also say to the priest: "Ezekiel, I am not re-
      stricted to a specific holy place. The future of My cause lies here with My
      captive people in Babylon. I am come to be with you in the captivity."

         Why do affliction and trial often open doors to richer experiences
      than we have known before? What personal attitudes and relation-
      ships determine the way we react to the storms that burst over our
      heads?
MON   11. GOD'S HAND DIRECTS THE WHEELS (Eze. 1:5-28; 10:8).

      4. Describe the cherubim that stepped out of the storm cloud before
      14
  I Am With You                                                 April 13
   the prophet's wondering gaze. Eze. 1:5-14 (compare Rev. 4:6-8).



   According to Ezekiel 10:18-22 the four living creatures were cherubim,
or angels.
    "According to later Jewish tradition the four forms, taking Ezekiel's
order, are the standards generally borne by the tribes of Reuben, Judah,
Ephraim, and Dan when they encamped in the wilderness (Num. 2:2). That
such were the ancient standards cannot be verified."—SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 4, p. 576. (Italics supplied.)
    The four living creatures represent the wisdom, strength, patience, and
swiftness of the angels in their service for mankind (see Heb. 1:14). They
"combine the wisdom and insight of all orders of creation—the reason, in-
telligence, devotion, and spiritual ardour of man; the majesty, courage, and
boldness of the lion; the submissiveness, patience, and strength of the ox;
and the vision, keenness of sight, swiftness of action, and striking power of
the eagle."—Edwin R. Thiele, Outline Studies in Revelation, part I, pp. 84,
85.

5. What was located at the side of each cherub? Eze. 1:15-21; 10:9,
   10. How would you explain the symbolism?



   The picture is not of a large wheel with a small wheel-insert lying on
the same plane. Rather, the idea is of two wheels bisecting each other at
right angles. This allowed movement in any of the four directions the
cherubim faced without their turning.
   Motion is emphasized in the vision. The cherubim had arms and hands
of their own (compare 1:8; 10:7). There also appeared to be "the form of
a man's hand under their wings" (10:8); that may symbolize "the spirit"
that directed them (1:12) on the earth or in the air. The four faces of the
cherubim and the bisected wheel arrangement imply that movement could
take place instantaneously in any direction without their stopping to turn.

6. What would the presence of "eyes" in these wheels suggest? Eze.
   1:18; 10:12 (compare Rev. 4:6; 5:6). In what manner were the
   wheels related to the cherubim? Eze. 1:19-21.



   At first view the complicated wheel systems appear to be the wheels of
God's movable throne (see Dan. 7:9). However, in this vision they seem to
be adapted to emphasize earthly concerns (see Eze. 1:15). The presence of
eyes in the wheels suggests that they symbolize intelligent forces under
God's control through angelic ministry. God has not abandoned this planet
with its affairs seeming to spin in all. directions without meaningful mo-
tion. God's eternal purpose for humanity as a whole, for the church, and
for our individual lives is being accomplished through agents of His
heavenly ministrations. (See Eph. 3:9-11; Rom. 8:28, 29.)
                                                                        15
 Lesson 2                                                         April 13
   Divine control of earthly affairs. "While the nations rejected God's
principles, and in this rejection wrought their own ruin, it was still manifest
that the divine, overruling purpose was working through all their move-
ments.
   "This lesson is taught in a wonderful symbolic representation given to
the prophet Ezekiel during his exile in the land of the Chaldeans. . . .
   "The wheels were so complicated in arrangement that at first sight they
appeared to be in confusion; but they moved in perfect harmony. Heavenly
beings, sustained and guided by the hand beneath the wings of the cheru-
bim, were impelling these wheels; above them, upon the sapphire throne,
was the Eternal One; and round about the throne a rainbow, the emblem of
divine mercy.
   "As the wheel-like complications were under the guidance of the hand
beneath the wings of the cherubim, so the complicated play of human
events is under divine control. Amidst the strife and tumult of nations, He
that sitteth above the cherubim still guides the affairs of the earth."—Edu-
cation, pp. 177, 178. (See Dan. 4:17, 25, 32, 35; Acts 17:26, 27.)

   Does your life and present situation seem as difficult to understand
as the wheels in Ezekiel's vision? Maybe forces are even spinning be-
yond your control? God has not promised that the Christian's path-
way will be one of ease. What has He promised? (See Isa. 41:10; 43:2;
Heb. 13:5, 6, 8.)

I11. GOD'S HAND ON EZEKIEL (Eze. 1:3; 3:14, 22).

7. What did Ezekiel mean by the expression, "the hand of the Lord
   was there upon [me]" (Eze. 1:3)? Eze. 3:14, 22 (compare 1 Kings
   18:46; 2 Kings 3:15).



   In this manner Ezekiel acknowledged that the power impelling him to
speak to the people came from God. The expression means that the prophet
was being moved by the Holy Spirit to speak the Word of God and that he
received direct revelations from God. (See Eze. 8:1, 2; 37:1.) Ezekiel's
authority did not rest in himself—nor in the supernatural trance. His
authority rested in God, who chose in this manner to communicate through
him to the people.

8. Ezekiel's attention was drawn to a Personage seated on a throne
   above the angels. Who was He and what effect did the sight have
   on the prophet? Eze. 1:26-28 (compare Rev. 1:17).



   The Scriptures record the experiences of several prophets who were
given visions of the Deity. Since the Deity dwells in "light which no man
can approach unto" (1 Tim. 6:16), these inspired scenes only represent
God to the prophet in human terms he can understand. But the visions do
emphasize different aspects of the divine Being. Isaiah's vision under-
16
        I Am With You                                                  April 13
      scores God's holiness (Isa. 6:1-3). Daniel's view portrays Him as the Judge
      of humankind (Dan. 7:9, 10). John's vision underscores the omniscience of
      God (Rev. 4:2, 3; 5:1). Micaiah's vision shows God's activity in the affairs
      of Israel (1 Kings 22:19). In Ezekiel's vision we are shown the Deity
      ruling and in full control of the complicated affairs of human life on this
      planet. All these different views of God are subordinate to His self-revela-
      tion in Jesus (see Heb. 1:1, 2).

WED    9. What special commission did God now give Ezekiel the priest?
          Eze. 2:1-5. Among whom was he to labor? Eze. 3:10, 11.



         Jeremiah worked among the Jews in Judah while the nation still had its
      independence, but, because he advocated submission to Babylon, he was
      viewed as a traitor and worthy of death (Jer. 38:1-4). On the other hand,
      Ezekiel was limited to working with Jewish captives, most of whom were
      restless, rebellious idolaters who expected to be released at any moment.

      10. Whether the people who heard Ezekiel repented or not, what
          would they come to know? Eze. 2:5; 33:33. What would be the
          significance of this fact?



         Ezekiel would be hurt emotionally by the bitter responses of the sin-
      hardened exiles. He would be torn and stung by verbal thorns and scor-
      pions (Eze. 2:6). Yet time would demonstrate the fact that he had spoken
      to them as a true prophet of God.
          Seventh-day Adventists have had a great privilege bestowed upon them
      through Ellen G. White, a recipient of the prophetic gift.

         Do we believe God's message? "My brethren, beware of the evil heart
      of unbelief. The word of God is plain and close in its restrictions; it inter-
      feres with your selfish indulgence; therefore you do not obey it. The tes-
      timonies of His Spirit call your attention to the Scriptures, point out your
      defects of character, and rebuke your sins; therefore you do not heed them.
      And to justify your carnal, ease-loving course you begin to doubt whether
      the testimonies are from God. If you would obey their teachings you would
      be assured of their divine origin. Remember, your unbelief does not affect
      their truthfulness. If they are from God they will stand. Those who seek to
      lessen the faith of God's people in these testimonies . . . are fighting
      against God. It is not the instrument whom you slight and insult, but God,
      who has spoken to you in these warnings and reproofs."—Testimonies,
      vol. 5, pp. 234, 235.

      11. What special role was involved in God's commission to Ezekiel?
          What is the significance of the manner in which the prophet's
          function is illustrated? Eze. 3:17-21; 33:7.


                                                                                 17
 Lesson 2                                                     April 13
   Above all things, a "watchman" needed to be dependable and re-
sponsible because the very lives of the people were at risk. Such an office
required a person of sound judgment, yet capable of making quick deci-
sions and acting on those decisions immediately.
   In the spiritual realm the watchman must be able to discriminate be-
tween the false and the genuine and to sound the alarm when spiritual de-
ceptions approach to deceive. A person with such keen perceptions can ex-
pect abuse from deceivers and misunderstanding from genuine believers
who may be confused by falsehood. The Lord endowed Ezekiel with an
iron will, that he might stand up to the opposition. (See Eze. 3:8, 9.)

  What does God's infinite love and His diligent effort to save
humanity suggest regarding the importance of our cooperation?

IV. GOD'S PREPARATION OF EZEKIEL (Eze. 2:8-10; 3:1-11).

12. What did God give Ezekiel while he was in vision? What had
    been written on both sides of this document? Eze. 2:8-10 (com-
    pare Rev. 10:8-10).



   Normally, scrolls were written on only one side. This scroll was written
on both sides, implying the large amount of material it contained. The ca-
lamities that were falling—and that were about to fall in greater severity—
were meant to awaken the sin-hardened people. The Lord took no personal
pleasure in the destruction of His beloved people (Eze. 18:32).

13. Why was the prophet asked to "eat" the scroll? Eze. 2:8; 3:1-4
    (compare Jer. 15:16).



   The "eating" suggests that the Lord's messages and teachings were to
be fully assimilated by the prophet. The symbolism also suggests that
Ezekiel was to be totally dedicated to his special ministry. We see such
dedication reflected in our Saviour's words: "My meat [food] is to do the
will of him that sent me, and to finish his work" (John 4:34; compare John
3:34; Matt. 4:4; 1 Peter 3:14-16).

V. GOD'S PRESENCE WITH HIS PEOPLE IN CAPTIVITY (Eze.
    11:16).

14. How did God assure the captive Israelites in Babylon that His
    presence was not restricted to the Temple in Jerusalem? Eze.
    11:16.



   This passage explains in part why in vision Ezekiel was permitted to see
the God of Israel traveling to Babylonia. Although His people would be

       I Am With You                                                 April 13
     captives in a foreign country, He would not abandon them. The Lord
     would go, as it were, into exile with them.
         "Happy are those who have a sanctuary, be it high or low, in the city or
     among the rugged mountain caves, in the lowly cabin or in the wilderness.
     If it is the best they can secure for the Master, He will hallow the place
     with His presence, for it will be holy unto the Lord of hosts."—Testimo-
     nies, vol. 5, pp. 491, 492.

     QUESTIONS TO PONDER.
        • How can I develop an assurance that God is with me?
        • In what ways can fellowship with believers in the services of the
     church help to make the presence of God real to me?
        • Is there something that the Lord is convicting me to do for someone
     just now? Could some of us form a small group ministry that could provide
     support for hurting people in our congregation?

     FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read "God's Care for His
El Work,"   Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 749-754. Consider the following passages
   that speak of God's presence with and care for His people: Gen. 28:15; Isa.
     43:2; Matt. 18:20; 28:20; Rev. 21:3.

     SUMMARY: Although the long-predicted storm of military invasion and
     subjugation eventually burst upon Judah in fury, God did not abandon His
     people. He was in full control of all seemingly uncontrolled events. Just so,
     God promises to be with His followers today in all their challenges.

The Ministry of Discipline

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ezekiel 4-7.

SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may
 PM
      have some that shall escape the sword among the nations, when
      ye shall be scattered through the countries" (Ezekiel 6:8).

WHY DOES GOD DISCIPLINE HIS PEOPLE? Why are His judg-
ments severe at times?

OUTLINE:
   I. A Prophetic Acted Parable (Ezekiel 4, 5).
  11. Days of Discipline (Eze. 4:4-8).
 I11. Distress and Destruction (Eze. 4:9-5:17).
 IV. Cause and Effect (Eze. 6:1-7; 7:1-27).
  V. The Remnant Revived (Eze. 6:8-10).

DISCIPLINE BEFORE ULTIMATE JUDGMENT. The Babylonian
conquest and captivity affected the lives of God's loyal people, as well as
those who had become His enemies. The destruction of Judah at the hands
of the Babylonians was severe. God had tried every possible means to cor-
rect the erring nation. But Judah, undeterred, pursued her idolatrous
course, mocking God's messengers "till there was no remedy" (2 Chron.
36:16). The merciful discipline meted out upon Israel resulted in the repen-
tance and salvation of many who had not placed themselves beyond hope
of redemption.
   On the larger scale, in the great moral controversy raging between
God and Satan, the judgment of separation and death will be experienced
by those who are determined to cling to sin and rebellion. This judgment
was endured by God's own Son, whose atoning and substitutionary death
has made our salvation possible.
    Many minor judgments are designed to capture the attention of the un-
wary and draw them to Christ. The ultimate judgment is administered only
when all else has failed to elicit positive response.

I. A PROPHETIC ACTED PARABLE (Ezekiel 4, 5).

1. How did Ezekiel react to God's commission appointing him to be
   His spokesman to Israel in the captivity? Eze. 3:14, 15.



20
 The Ministry of Discipline                                     April 20
   The Hebrew word translated "heat" in this passage may also be ren-
dered as "wrath," "fury," or "hot displeasure." The term suggests that
Ezekiel became angry and bitter over his commission. He did not argue
with God audibly like Habakkuk, but apparently seethed inwardly, sitting
in silence among the captives at Telabib. Since the prophet did not explain
the cause of his emotional upheaval, we can only deduce that his frustra-
tion resulted from a combination of several things: his disappointed hopes,
the difficulty of the assignment, righteous indignation because of the spir-
itual defection of his countrymen, and, perhaps, feelings of unfitness.

2. When God recommissioned the reluctant prophet seven days later,
   what physical phenomenon befell him? Eze. 3:16, 17, 22-27.



   "As with Zacharias (Luke 1:22), who disbelieved the words of the
angel, there seems to be a rebuke here of Ezekiel's refusal to speak when
bidden. Yet the Lord used the experience for good. The dumbness of the
prophet and the ability to speak only when the Lord opened his mouth was
a further sign to that rebellious house that the words were indeed the words
of the Lord."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 587.
   This state of intermittent dumbness lasted until the destruction of
Jerusalem in 586 B.C., about seven and one-half years. Ezekiel's loss of
speech may have led him to act out many of his prophecies, although other
prophets also used visual aids. (See Jer. 27:2, 3; 28:10; Isa. 20:3, 4.)

3. How did Ezekiel act out his first message to the captives? What
   did it foretell? Eze. 4:1-3; 5:5-8.



4. What good purpose did the Lord anticipate would be achieved
   through the destruction of Judah and the scattering of His people?
   Eze. 20:37, 38, 43 (compare Jer. 30:11).



   "Humbled in the sight of the nations, those who once had been recog-
nized as favored of Heaven above all other peoples of the earth were to
learn in exile the lesson of obedience so necessary for their future happi-
ness. Until they had learned this lesson, God could not do for them all that
He desired to do. 'I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee
altogether unpunished,' He declared in explanation of His purpose to chas-
tise them for their spiritual good."—Prophets and Kings, p. 475.

5. How are we to understand the biblical record in which God Him-
   self says, "I raise up the Chaldeans" (Hab. 1:6)? Jer. 27:5-8.
   Ezekiel's acted parable of the siege of Jerusalem represented
   God's judgments against Judah (Eze. 5:8). Why did the Lord use
   wicked nations to discipline and test His people? See Isa. 10:5-13
   (compare Job 42:11; 1:9-12; 2:5-7).
                                                                           21
 Lesson 3                                                        April 20
   To the Hebrew mind everything was ultimately caused by God, even
though human responsibility was not denied. Consequently, in the Bible,
God is often said to do things which, in our Western way of thinking, He
permits or does not prevent from happening. Thus, when God withdrew
His blessing and protective hand from rebellious Israel and defiant Judah,
Assyrian and Babylonian forces, prompted by their cruel ambition to con-
quer and plunder, invaded Israel. God permitted their actions as a means of
disciplining and correcting His people.

   What is the purpose of discipline? How essential is it to the well-
being of a family, a school, a church, or a nation? (See Heb. 12:5-11.)

11. DAYS OF DISCIPLINE (Eze. 4:4-8).

6. What new role did the prophet now assume as he acted out the
   siege of Jerusalem? Eze. 4:4-8. How long did he represent each na-
   tion? What is the significance of God's words "Thou shalt bear
   the iniquity of the house" of Israel or Judah?



    The principle of retribution is being portrayed by the prophet. The apos-
tle Paul expresses that principle in plain words: "Be not deceived; God is
not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap" (Gal.
6:7; compare Prov. 11:5; Ps. 34:21; Jer. 2:19).
    The prophet probably lay on his side for only portions of each day. The
people watched and sought to understand the meaning of his actions.
Supernatural power held him fast in his assumed positions (Eze. 4:8).
    Although identification of the specific time periods is difficult,
the major point of the acted prophecy is crystal clear: The Assyrian-
Babylonian captivities were being used as agencies of God's punishment
and discipline for the past years of Hebrew sin and rebellion.

7. In ordering Ezekiel figuratively to "bear the iniquity" of Israel
   and Judah, God quoted the essence of Numbers 14:34. Compare
   Eze. 4:4-6 and Num. 14:34. Who spoke the words in Numbers?



   The Lord's instruction to Ezekiel (in Eze. 4:4-6) provides an important
key to unlock the symbolic time periods in the visions given to Daniel
(Ezekiel's contemporary) and those given later in the book of Revelation.
Ezekiel introduces the year-day principle in which a symbolic day stands
for a literal year.
   God's statement to the prophet is based on a previous statement in Num-
bers. A somewhat literal translation of these passages reads as follows. (The
numbered phrases indicate similar Hebrew wording in the two passages.)
   Numbers 14:34: "According to (1) the number of the days which you
spied out the land, forty days, (2) a day for the year, a day for the year, (3)
you shall bear your evil forty years."

22
  The Ministry of Discipline                                     April 20
   Ezekiel 4:4-6: (1) "The number of the days you lie on your side, and (3)
you shall bear their evil. I have given you the years of their evil according
to (1) a number of days, three hundred and ninety days, and (3) you shall
bear the evil of the house of Israel, . . . and (3) you shall hear the evil of
the house of Judah forty days, (2) a day for the year, a day for the year I
have given you."
   It can be seen from these comparisons that God's words in Ezekiel re-
flect His statement in Numbers. The year-day principle introduced in
Ezekiel has linguistic precedent in Numbers. The two passages illustrate
that a day stands for a year in symbolic Bible prophecy. Only by the use of
this principle can the prophetic time periods in Daniel and Revelation be
understood.

I11. DISTRESS AND DESTRUCTION (Eze. 4:9-5:17).

8. What provisions was the prophet to set aside for his acted
    prophecy of the siege of Jerusalem? How much was he permitted
    to eat and drink each day? Eze. 4:9-11.



   The allotment was scarcely sufficient to sustain life: about eight ounces
of bread and a fraction more than a pint of water per day. The Hebrew ex-
pression underlying the KJV ("from time to time") seems to carry the
meaning "once a day" (RSV). Famine conditions would prevail in the
coming siege.

9. How desperate would the conditions become in the beleaguered
    city? Eze. 5:10 (compare Jer. 19:9; Lam. 4:10).



   The devastating famine with its resultant atrocities did not have to take
place. King Zedekiah and the people were repeatedly urged to surrender to
the Babylonians in order to avoid the terrible conditions of siege warfare
and the inevitable destruction. (See Jer. 21:8, 9.) The extreme suffering
that Ezekiel portrayed testified to the extreme, sin-hardened condition of
Jerusalem's inhabitants. They would rather practice the horrors of can-
nibalism, eating their own parents and children, than repent of their sins
against God and man—or surrender!

10. How did Ezekiel's acted prophecy illustrate other effects of the
    Babylonian siege and conquest?

     Eze. 4:1-3

     Eze. 4:3-8

     Eze. 4:9-17

     Eze. 5:1, 2, 12
                                                                            23
 Lesson 3                                                        April 20
11. What glorious plan did God have in mind originally when He
    placed Israel in Palestine? Eze. 5:5; Gen. 22:15-18 (compare
    Deut. 7:6-11; Ex. 15:17).



   "Through the Jewish nation it was God's purpose to impart rich bless-
ings to all peoples. Through Israel the way was to be prepared for the dif-
fusion of His light to the whole world. The nations of the world, through fol-
lowing corrupt practices, had lost the knowledge of God. Yet in His mercy
God did not blot them out of existence. He purposed to give them oppor-
tunity for becoming acquainted with Him through His church. He designed
that the principles revealed through His people should be the means of res-
toring the moral image of God in man."—Christ' s Object Lessons, p. 286.

12. What kind of witness would the sinful Hebrew nation now give
    under divine discipline? Eze. 5:11, 14, 15 (compare Deut. 28:37;
    1 Kings 9:6-9).



   Planted at the crossroads of three continents (Africa, Asia, Europe),
Israel was intended to be God's instrument to influence the nations God-
ward. Israel partially succeeded. Even surrounding nations admitted they
were wise and righteous (Deut. 4:6, 8). But Israel's disobedience to God's
laws and the divine judgments that were administered also had an in-
fluence on other nations. The judgments provide an instructive lesson for
Christians, as well as for the nations of earth today.

   The Seventh-day Adventist Church is responsible for its influence.
Today it is established in 184 countries in its endeavor to uplift Christ
to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people. If individuals or units of
this far-flung church disobey the will of God or bring reproach upon
the cause, how does God judge and discipline them?

IV. CAUSE AND EFFECT (Eze. 6:1-7; 7:1-27).

13. Against what geographical area was Ezekiel commanded to
    prophesy? Why? Eze. 6:1-3, 13 (compare Hosea 4:13; Jer. 3:6).
    What had God originally commanded Israel to do with these
    locations? Deut. 12:2, 3.



   Mountains, hills, and groves were favorite places for idolatrous wor-
ship. "High places" were open-air sanctuaries. Although they were not al-
ways situated on mountaintops, they were established on elevated sites.
Apparently the worshipers felt closer to their deities on mountaintops or
other elevated areas. The green trees afforded shade from the intense heat
and privacy for the practice of licentious rites.

24
 The Ministry of Discipline                                      April 20
14. What warning had God given regarding idol worship? Lev.
    26:27-30. Centuries later what terrible disciplinary judgments did
    God pronounce upon His people? Eze. 6:3-7, 11-14.



    More than a century and a half had elapsed since the prophets had first
begun to warn of the destruction of Jerusalem and the nation. Yet nothing
had happened. (See Micah 3:12; Amos 2:4, 5.)
    To shake the people's complacency Ezekiel announced five times in
three verses: "The end is come, the end is come" (Eze. 7:2, 3, 6). The
terrible discipline could be delayed no longer. Within approximately six
years after Ezekiel's acted prediction of its ruin, Jerusalem lay desolate and
its people were either dead or in captivity.

   Why do God's announcements of coming discipline seldom take
place immediately? Jerusalem did not meet its fate until more than a
century after Micah. What other Bible examples can you cite? What
relevance does this fact have for us?

V. THE REMNANT REVIVED (Eze. 6:8-10).

   When calamity befell Judah, it is obvious that the righteous suffered, as
well as the wicked. Daniel, Ezekiel, and their brethren suffered the con-
sequences of divine discipline along with the rebellious apostates. But they
chose to be loyal to God and to serve Him openly in the land of their exile.

15. In Ezekiel's prophecy of Jerusalem's punishment, how did he il-
    lustrate the salvation of a remnant of the nation? Eze. 5:1-3; 6:8, 9.



16. What strange thing did the prophet do with a few of the hairs he
    had cut off? Eze. 5:4 (compare Jer. 43:1-7).



   Fearing reprisals from Babylon because of the murder of Gedeliah, the
governor, whom Nebuchadnezzar had placed over the land of Judah, a
large group of Jews who had escaped capture migrated into Egypt. This
move was contrary to God's will, and Jeremiah was forced to go with
them. Hardened in their sins, these sojourners rejected Jeremiah's reproof.
In response, the prophet foretold their death when the forces of Babylon
would invade Egypt. (See Jer. 44:26-30.) This rebellious portion of the na-
tion in Egypt is represented by the hairs that Ezekiel first tucked into his
robe and later removed and burned in the fire.

   God's discipline a blessing. Because of the Assyrian and Babylonian
invasions, Israelites who had been transported abroad established syn-
agogues in most of the main cities of the Near East, and later of the Roman
Empire. The synagogues provided temporary "pulpits" for the apostles
                                                                            25
      Lesson 3                                                                  April 20
     and early Christians and enabled them to establish Christian congregations
     very quickly throughout these areas. Thus God's discipline not only saved
     a remnant who repented of their sins, but it opened the door for the Chris-
     tian message to be preached to Gentiles. (See Prophets and Kings, p. 292.)

     HOW DO I RELATE TO DISCIPLINE?
        • How can I react to my present trial so as to make it a means of spir-
     itual growth?
        • Are all the problems and difficulties that befall me a direct punish-
     ment from God? How can I tell?
        • How can divine discipline be avoided?


ui   FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read "Help in Daily
     Living" in The Ministry of Healing, pp. 469-482. Consider the attitudes
     Christians should adopt now in view of future punishment for sin: Matt.
     24:43-51; 2 Peter 3:11, 12.

     SUMMARY: God disciplines His people individually and corporately so
     that we may become fully aware of our great needs and may turn to Him
     in repentance for forgiveness and restoration.

      9:4).

GRADUAL APOSTASY. Why do God's people—whether as individuals
or as a corporate group—seldom, if ever, apostatize suddenly? Why are
believers in God prone to backslide from Him?

SECRET SIN DESTROYS. Dr. Joseph Conlee, who lived in the last half
of the nineteenth century, grew up in a devout Methodist home, one of
twelve children. Encouraged by his father to enter the ministry, the bright
lad left the family farm in Iowa for seven years to study at the State Col-
lege and Seminary. He became a pastor in Santa Ana, California. The fu-
ture looked promising for the young man and his bride, except for one
problem, known only to himself.
   In his student days Dr. Conlee had begun to study the infidel works of
such writers as Thomas Paine, Renan, and Huxley, and to entertain their
doubts. Although in time he pastored some of his denomination's largest
churches on the west coast of the United States, his cherished doubts ate
away at his spiritual nature like a hidden cancer until one day he said to his
wife, "I'm through; I've preached my last sermon."
    During the next few years, Conlee turned to smoking, drinking, and
gambling. He suppressed his weakened conscience by attacking the faith
he once espoused. Conlee became the president of the Free Thinkers Asso-
ciation of the State of California and became known as a lecturer on
atheism. Overcome by alcoholism, he rapidly deteriorated physically and
mentally into a dissolute inebriate. For twelve years he did not miss a night
at his favorite saloon.
    Finally, a group of caring friends raised the money and sent him off into
                                                                           27

the wilds of the Yukon to prospect for gold. During one long Klondike
winter in a little, snow-buried cabin, Conlee and two other former Christi-
ans found Christ again through reading a Bible his daughter had placed in
the medicine box in his trunk. Once more the amazing spiritual grace of
the gospel prevailed over the power of whisky to save a ruined life and re-
store him as a witness for Christ.
   Not all such experiences end with salvation. The important point is that
Christians often backslide by cherishing secret sins and doubts.
   Judah's fall did not materialize overnight. By means of an extraordi-
nary vision, Ezekiel was shown what actually was happening in the
Temple at Jerusalem. The divine principle of cause and effect could not be
wished away: sin leads inevitably to ruin.

I. TREASON IN THE TEMPLE (Eze. 8:1-18).

   Fourteen months after his call to prophetic office, Ezekiel received a
new series of visions. Some of the "elders of Judah"—evidently older
men who had oversight of the community of exiles—were visiting the
prophet when the Lord gave him a vision.

1. Whom did Ezekiel immediately see in his vision? Eze. 8:2 (com-
   pare 1:26-28). In what strange manner was the prophet in vision
   transported to the Temple in Jerusalem? Eze. 8:3.



   The people openly stole, murdered, and practiced immorality and
idolatry while pretending to worship Yahweh in His Temple. Jeremiah
had predicted that the great edifice would be destroyed just as the sanctu-
ary at Shiloh was abandoned and probably destroyed in the days of Eli.
(See Jer. 7:8-15.) Ezekiel was shown the utter depravity of the national
leaders and the people. The Lord revealed to him the shameful fact that the
Temple, the house of the true God, was being used as a pagan temple!

2. What else was Ezekiel shown? What is significant about the
   prophet's awareness that the "glory of the God of Israel" was also
   there? Eze. 8:4-6.



   The idol was not in the Most Holy Place, but rather in the outer court on
the north side of the Temple. Its presence in the Lord's Temple-sanctuary
was an open affront to Him. The worship of the idol in the court carried a
clear message: " 'Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great
abominations that the house of Israel are committing here, to drive me far
from my sanctuary?' " (Eze. 8:6, RSV, italics supplied).

3. Ezekiel was permitted to penetrate a large room that was out of
   bounds to the people. What did he see displayed on its walls?
   Who were engaged in acts of idol worship? What was their at-
   titude toward God? Eze. 8:7-12.

         Ezekiel did not witness young people, ignorant of their heritage, caught
      up by the appeal of a foreign cult. Rather, he saw seventy "of the ancients
      of the house of Israel," men who forty years earlier had participated in the
      spiritual revival of King Josiah. Ezekiel even recognized a leader whom he
      knew personally. In their sunset years, these leaders had secretly aban-
      doned the worship of the true God to swing their censers before unfeeling
      carved reliefs of beasts and to do homage to art forms of unclean animals.
      Their sin-clouded minds prompted them to exclaim foolishly: "The Lord
      seeth us not; the Lord hath forsaken the earth" (Eze. 8:12; compare 9:9).

MON   4. In what activity were some of the Jewish women engaged? Eze.
         8:13, 14.



         Instead of being God's "house of prayer for all people" (Isa. 56:7), the
      Temple had become a center for heathen cults. Tammuz was "a god of
      Sumerian origin whose worship was spread throughout the ancient world.
      He was the god of pastures and flocks, the heavenly shepherd, who died
      annually and rose to new life every year after Ishtar, his wife and sister, de-
      scended into the nether world and brought him up again."—SDA Bible
      Dictionary, "Tammuz." The ceremonies of this nature worship involved
      both mourning and fertility rites.
         Ezekiel was witness to the terribly debased condition of Judah's women
      and their deep attachment to idolatry. (See Jer. 7:17, 18; 44:15-19.)

      5. What was the last scene shown to Ezekiel? Because they were able
         to enter "the inner court" of the Temple, who were these men?
         Eze. 8:15, 16.



         To prevent an easy drift into sun worship, the entrance to the Temple
      faced eastward so that the worshipers automatically bowed toward the
      west when worshiping God. The "inner court," that is, the area "between
      the porch and the altar," was restricted to the priesthood. (See Joel 2:17.)
      Thus, these men probably were priests. For the very priests of the Lord to
      turn their backs upon His Temple in order to worship the rising sun was a
      most flagrant insult to God.

         What kind of idolatry is most likely to be practiced by Christians
      today? Do you think secret, cherished sin is more damaging to Chris-
      tian experience than open sin? What reason would you give for your
      opinion?

      11. MARKED FOR SAFEKEEPING (Eze. 9:1-11).

      6. At this point in the vision, to what location did God move? What
         is the significance of His taking this position? Eze. 9:3 (compare
         Rev. 15:8; 16:1).

                                                                                  29
 Lesson 4                                                        April 27
7. Whom did God summon now to appear before Him? Eze. 9:1, 2.
   What instruction did the Lord give to the man with the writing
   equipment? Eze. 9:3, 4, 11.



   It is evident from the first part of the vision (Ezekiel 8) that many prac-
ticed their idolatry in secret. On the surface, the false and the genuine ap-
peared alike. The marking process separated the two groups and under-
scored the truth once more that "man looketh on the outward appearance,
but the Lord looketh on the heart" (1 Sam. 16:7). "The foundation of God
standeth sure, having this seal, the Lord knoweth them that are his"
(2 Tim. 2:19). By means of the vision of the sealing or marking, the Lord
informed the prophet that He would spare the few righteous remaining in
the land.

8. As soon as the marking was finished, what were the men with the
   weapons to do? Eze. 9:6, 7.



   Remember that we are reading the record of a vision written by the
prophet. It is a representation. These events never took place in this man-
ner. The six men with slaughter weapons symbolized the impending Baby-
lonian invasion and destruction of Judah and Jerusalem. The vision con-
veyed several important messages to the captive exiles: (1) God knew His
own true followers and would protect their lives. They were marked for
safekeeping. (2) God recognized the accountability of the "ancient
men"—priests and other leaders. They thought they could live their sinful
lives in secret, but they would be exposed and be among the first punished
by the destructive forces of Babylon. (3) Judah's probationary time had run
out. The Lord could no longer spare His own people who had completely
turned their backs on Him.

   What does it mean to "sigh" and "cry" for "all the abominations
that be done" in the land? Eze. 9:4. Are persons of a critical bent
more "Christian" than secret or open sinners? (Compare Matt. 7:1-5;
Rom. 2:1-3.) How can I relate to sin in the church and at the same
time be supportive of the church?

I11. THE END-TIME SEAL OF GOD (Ezekiel 9; Rev. 7:1-3; 14:1-5).

    Ezekiel, as well as some of his contemporaries, referred to the imminent
destruction of Judah as "the day of the Lord." (See Eze. 7:19; Zeph. 1:7,
14-18.) " 'The day of the Lord' is the time when, historically, the proba-
tion of a city or a nation closes, and ultimately when the destiny of all men
is forever fixed."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 164.
    Note how the second advent of Christ is described by the same phrase.
(See 1 Thess. 5:1-8; 2 Peter 3:3, 8-10.)

9. In vision Ezekiel saw some persons marked for safekeeping (Eze.
30
        Secret Sins                                                    April 27
          9:4-6). Whom did John see "sealed" or marked for safekeeping
          in the final "day of the Lord"? Rev. 7:1-8.



      10. Whereas Ezekiel saw the marking of a single group (Eze. 9:4-6),
          what two groups does John see marked in the final crisis? Rev.
          7:1-8; 13:15-17 (compare 14:1-5, 9, 10).



         In Ezekiel's vision one group was marked for God and spared the
      slaughter that befell the rest. John envisions the last generation of humanity
      separated into two classes: those who receive the seal of the living God, and
      those who receive the mark of the beast. There will be no neutral ground.
         (On the application of this vision to the last days see Testimonies, vol.
      3, pp. 266, 267 and vol. 5, pp. 210-212.)
WED   11. In addition to Ezekiel's characterization (9:4-6), what other two
          traits are noted in the end-time followers of God? Rev. 14:12.



         The 144,000 symbolically represent God's righteous remnant who will
      live through the final events after the close of human probation. They are
      distinguished by two traits: (1) They keep the commandments of God—the
      Ten Commandments, including the Sabbath. (2) They have the "faith of
      Jesus," or "faith in Jesus," the Source and Means of their salvation. Their
      commandment keeping is the result of their faith (grace) relationship with
      Christ.

      12. Another aspect of Ezekiel's prophecy (Ezekiel 9) is that it
          foreshadows similar apostasy among God's followers in the end-
          time. How did Jesus describe the end-time condition of His
          people? Matt. 24:12; Luke 18:8. What special message is ad-
          dressed to the end-time church? Will any respond? Rev. 3:14-22.



      13. Ezekiel 9:6 appears to be echoed in the New Testament by the
          apostle Peter. Who does Peter imply are the most accountable for
          their influence and example? 1 Peter 4:17.



         "The leaven of godliness has not entirely lost its power. At the time
      when the danger and depression of the church are greatest, the little com-
      pany who are standing in the light will be sighing and crying for the abom-
      inations that are done in the land. But more especially will their prayers
      arise in behalf of the church because its members are doing after the man-
      ner of the world. . . .
                                                                                  31
 Lesson 4                                                      April 27
   "They mourn before God to see religion despised in the very homes of
those who have had great light. They lament and afflict their souls be-
cause pride, avarice, selfishness, and deception of almost every kind are in
the church. The Spirit of God, which prompts to reproof, is trampled un-
derfoot, while the servants of Satan triumph. God is dishonored, the truth
made of none effect. . . .
   "Our own course of action will determine whether we shall receive the
seal of the living God or be cut down by the destroying weapons."—Tes-
timonies, vol. 5, pp. 209-212. (Compare Ezekiel 7:27; 9:10.)

IV. FIRE OVER JERUSALEM (Eze. 10:1-7).

  In the midst of the cherubim whom Ezekiel saw transporting the Lord
upon His throne were "burning coals of fire" (Eze. 1:13).

14. What did the Lord instruct the man in linen to do with some of
    the coals? Eze. 10:1-7. What was the significance of this act?
    Compare Rev. 8:5.



   Most commentators believe the scattering of fire over the city of
Jerusalem foreshadowed the actual burning of city and Temple—the final
act of war by the Babylonians. (See 2 Kings 25:9; 2 Chron. 36:19.) In light
of similar symbolism in Revelation 8:5 the act may also have signified the
close of Judah's probation. The end had truly come (Eze. 7:6).

15. In what ways is the man clothed in linen (Eze. 9:4; 10:2) like
    Christ? John 10:27, 28; 5:22.



   Ezekiel and Jeremiah gave many warnings that Judah's probationary
time was running out. The evidence was abundant. Christians, living in
"the time of the end" (Dan. 12:4) also have much evidence that earth's
probationary time is running out. How should the wise, God-fearing Chris-
tian prepare for the close of human probation? It could be as near as one's
death or nearer. We have good reason to believe that the announcement
terminating the pre-Advent judgment in heaven is imminent. (See Rev.
22:11, 12.)

V. THE TEMPLE ABANDONED (Eze. 10:8-22).

16. To what place did the Lord move before decreeing destruction
    for Judah? Eze. 9:3; 10:4. Where did the cherubim next take the
    Lord? Eze. 10:18, 19. To what area did the Lord finally move?
    Eze. 11:22, 23.



     The mountain "on the east side of the city" is more familiarly known
32
        Secret Sins                                                  April 27
      in the New Testament as "the mount of Olives." (Compare Matt. 23:37-
      39; 24:1-3.)
         The movements of God away from the Temple and city symbolized His
      reluctance to separate from Judah. God never initiates a withdrawal from
      His people. He does so reluctantly only after they forsake Him. The with-
      drawal in stages underscores His longsuffering.
         The Lord's abandonment of the Temple and city suggests that He
      would now especially identify Himself with the captive exiles. Here is
      where a genuine remnant would develop. The once-secret sins of the na-
      tion had led it into open apostasy and national ruin.

      WHAT STEPS DO YOU BELIEVE that a Christian should follow in
      overcoming secret sins?




      FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read "The Seal of God,"
lia   Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 207-216.
         • Since sin begins in the mind, how can I prevent it from taking root?
      (See Matt 5:28; Phil 4:8.)
         • How was Jesus able to meet inner temptation to sin? (See Matt. 4:4;
      Ps. 40:8.)
         • The believer is a temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 6:19, 20). How can
      I prevent His departure from my soul-temple? (See Ps. 51:1-3, 10, 11.)

         SUMMARY: Judah's terrible apostasy and fall proves once again
      Moses' statement: "Be sure your sin will find you out" (Num. 32:23).
      Rather than cherish our darling sins, let us pray God for grace to repent of
      them and to live with "a conscience void of offence toward God, and
      toward men" (Acts 24:16).

April 28—May 4



      The Certainty of God's
              Word
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ezekiel 11:1-13; 12; 24:1-14.

SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "Thus saith the Lord God; there shall none
PM    of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have
      spoken shall be done, saith the Lord God" (Ezekiel 12:28).

WHY IS IT SO EASY FOR A CHRISTIAN'S SPIRITUAL ZEAL TO
COOL? Why do we tend to doubt the certainty of God's promises or judg-
ments?

OUTLINE:
   I. Defiant Despair (Eze. 11:1-13).
  11. An Acted Prophecy of the Exile (Eze. 12:1-20).
 I11. Faded Visions (Eze. 12:21-25).
 IV. Present Visions of Future Events (Eze. 12:26-28).

DO NOT POSTPONE A DECISION FOR CHRIST. World War II was
at its height. Ilona, uprooted like thousands of other war brides, had turned
to a serious study of the Bible. Her mind quickly grasped the claims and
promises of Christianity. At first great joy and peace pervaded her life, a
peace that the worldly-wise young woman had never experienced. But
Ilona hesitated to make a full commitment to Christ.
    "In a short time this terrible war will be over," Ilona said to her friend,
"and Joe will be home. There will be peace—the United Nations will see
to that! We're going to settle down in our dream house and rear a little
family."
    "What about Christ's claims on your life, Ilona?" pleaded her friend.
"Won't you accept His grace and become His follower right now?"
    "I know," she mused thoughtfully with a faraway look in her eyes.
"But you see. . . ."
    Four years after the war, Ilona died while giving birth to her second
child. As far as her friend knew, she died unprepared to meet her Lord. The
Saviour's return seemed so far off; His invitation too restrictive. But the
end was nearer than Ilona thought. (Adapted. Frank B. Holbrook, "Pastor,
What About the Millennium?" These Times, February 1977, pp. 20-24.)
    Ilona's indecision is typical of our human nature. We mistakenly think
that happiness is not to be found in God. Because He bears long with us,
we may doubt whether His promises or judgments will ever take place.
    This was the excuse impenitent Judah employed in the sixth century
34
       The Certainty of God's Word                                       May 4
      B.C. to steel herself against the Lord's final appeals through His prophets.


iii   I. DEFIANT DESPAIR (Eze. 11:1-13).

         Ezekiel chapter 11 continues with the vision that began in 8:1. The
      prophet still is in the Temple area.

      1. What group standing near the east gate of the Temple is shown to
         Ezekiel? Who were these persons? What were they discussing
         among themselves? Eze. 11:1-3.



         Ezekiel recognized the faces of two of these persons—Jaazaniah and
      Pelatiah. These twenty-five men were not priests, but "princes of the
      people"—the secular rulers who evidently made up the hard core of those
      urging King Zedekiah to resist surrender to the Babylonians.

      2. In contrast to the plans of the princes, what counsel would
         Jeremiah eventually give the people? Jer. 21:8-10.



         The discussion of the wicked princes at the Temple gate is put in the
      form of a proverb (Eze. 11:3). " 'The time is not near to build houses; this
      city is the caldron, and we are the flesh' " (RSV). The princes are prob-
      ably discussing the future of the city and nation. They are arguing that it is
      inappropriate at this point to follow peaceful pursuits, such as building
      homes. Rather, the nation must prepare for war. They firmly believe the
      city's defenses are impregnable. Jerusalem's walls will protect them from
      the flame of war just as a stout caldron protects the cooking meat from the
      direct fire. Throwing the divine warnings aside, they would foolishly resist
      the Babylonian invasion. In their puny strength they would attempt to pre-
      vent the prophesied fulfillment of doom.

      3. What was God's response to the haughty presumption of these
         princes? Who would remain within the city walls? What would
         happen to these leaders? Eze. 11:4-11. How was this prophecy ful-
         filled? 2 Kings 25:18-21.



         The same spirit of defiance that motivated the princes to oppose God's
      explicit Word still exists today when we set our hearts to do what God has
      said, but in our own way. They would not admit their need to accept God's
      counsel. We can thank God that the counsel to the Laodiceans still offers a
      remedy, but the time will come when He will reject the defiant as He did
      in Ezekiel's day.

         "The prevailing spirit of our time is one of infidelity and apostasy—
      a spirit of avowed illumination because of a knowledge of truth, but in re-
                                                                                 35

        Lesson 5                                                           May 4
      ality of the blindest presumption. Human theories are exalted and placed
      where God and His law should be. Satan tempts men and women to dis-
      obey, with the promise that in disobedience they will find liberty and free-
      dom that will make them as gods. There is seen a spirit of opposition to the
      plain word of God, of idolatrous exaltation of human wisdom above divine
      revelation."—Prophets and Kings, p. 178 (italics supplied).

         The sin of the princes revealed itself in their defiant attitude. The
      "spirit of rebellion and defiance [is] . . . one of the signs of the last
      days"—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 91. How can we avoid developing such
      an attitude toward spiritual leaders and secular authorities?
MON   11. AN ACTED PROPHECY OF THE EXILE (Eze. 12:1-20).

      4. What was the prophet to prepare in the sight of the people? Eze.
         12:1-4. What was he to do when evening drew on? Why did he
         place a handkerchief over his face? Eze. 12:5-7.



         Apparently, the prophet himself did not understand the significance of
      his actions until God revealed it the next morning (verse 8).

      5. Whom did Ezekiel represent in the acted prophecy? Eze. 12:8-15.
         Note Jeremiah's record of the events as they actually took place
         about five years later. Jer. 52:4-11.



         If the king of Judah knew about Ezekiel's acted prophecy, the knowledge
      had no effect on his decisions. Zedekiah seems to have been a plaything in
      the hands of his determined and stubborn princes. (See Jer. 38:5, 14-27.)

      6. Wherein did Zedekiah fail as a king? Compare 1 Kings 9:4-9;
         2 Kings 24:18-20 (compare 2 Chron. 36:11-13).



         "The greatest want of the world is the want of men—men who will not
      be bought or sold; men who in their inmost souls are true and honest; men
      who do not fear to call sin by its right name; men whose conscience is as
      true to duty as the needle to the pole; men who will stand for the right
      though the heavens fall.
         "But such a character is not the result of accident; it is not due to special
      favors or endowments of Providence. A noble character is the result of self-
      discipline, of the subjection of the lower to the higher nature—the surrender
      of self for the service of love to God and man."—Education, p. 57.

      7. After enacting the fate that was to befall the king, Ezekiel was to
         stress once more the terrible nature of the siege. How did he
         demonstrate this? Eze. 12:17-20 (compare 4:9-17).
      36
       The Certainty of God's Word                                     May 4
        Neither rulers nor people needed to endure the privations of the siege.
     Jeremiah encouraged both to surrender and promised that their lives and
     the city itself would be spared if they did. (See Jer. 38:2-4, 17-20.) The
     princes saw such counsel as treason. They would attempt to prevent the
     prophet's predictions of doom by murdering him.

        Was King Zedekiah a victim of circumstances, unable to do what he
     knew was right because of his situation? Do you feel helpless in your
     circumstances? In what ways might your circumstances be overruled
     for good?

        "There are men who flatter themselves that they might do something
     great and good if they were only circumstanced differently, while they
     make no use of the faculties they already have by working in the positions
     where Providence has placed them. Man can make his circumstances, but
     circumstances should never make the man. Man should seize circum-
     stances as his instruments with which to work. He should master circum-
     stances, but should never allow circumstances to master him. Individual in-
     dependence and individual power are the qualities now needed. Individual
     character need not be sacrificed, but it should be modulated, refined, ele-
     vated"—Testimonies, vol. 3, pp. 496, 497.


SI   I11. FADED VISIONS (Eze. 12:21-25).

     8. What argument against the imminent doom of the nation was
        stated in the form of a catchy proverb? Eze. 12:22. Was there any
        truth in the proverb?



        The Moffatt Bible translates the proverb in this manner: "Time passes,
     but no vision ever comes to anything." In other words, the terrible threats
     of God against the nation seem to be nothing more than words because
     things continue as usual. Because there seemed to be some truth in the pro-
     verb, it became a soothing sedative. Actually, God began to give such
     prophecies against Jerusalem through Amos, more than 150 years earlier.
     (See Amos 2:4, 5.) Jeremiah acknowledged this fact to the false prophet
     Hananiah. (See Jer. 28:8.)

     9. What is the effect on people when judgment is delayed? See Eccl.
        8:11 (compare Amos 6:1, 3).



        Do not presume upon God's patience. "In His dealings with the
     human race, God bears long with the impenitent. He uses His appointed
     agencies to call men to allegiance, and offers them His full pardon if they
     will repent. But because God is long-suffering, men presume on His
     mercy. . . . The patience and long-suffering of God, which should soften
     and subdue the soul, has an altogether different influence upon the careless
     and sinful. It leads them to cast off restraint, and strengthens them in re-
                                                                              37

      sistance. They think that the God who has borne so much from them will
      not heed their perversity. If we lived in a dispensation of immediate re-
      tribution, offenses against God would not occur so often. But though
      delayed, the punishment is none the less certain."—Ellen G. White Com-
      ments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1166.

WED   10. What was the Lord's response to those Jews who believed His
          warnings were just empty threats because time continued on and
          nothing happened? Eze. 12:23, 25.



         God spoke these words through Ezekiel in 592/591 B.C. (See Eze. 8:1.)
      In less than 3 1/2 years the Babylonians invaded Judah and laid siege to
      Jerusalem. (See Eze. 24:1, 2.) Approximately 1 1/2 years later Jerusalem
      lay a smoldering ruin. The vision of the "day of the Lord" (Eze. 13:5) for
      Judah had not faded.
         The tendency to misread God's long-suffering as an empty threat is per-
      vasive in our times as well.

      11. What did Peter foresee would happen "in the last days"? The
          complaint about the delayed return of Christ is similar to that
          made by Jews who hid behind their proverb in Ezekiel's time.
          What is Peter's response to this charge? 2 Peter 3:3-10.



         Similar challenges are made to Seventh-day Adventists. We are some-
      times told that, because it is well over one hundred years since we first
      began proclaiming the nearness of the second advent of Christ, we should
      now admit we have been mistaken.

         Christ's return is certain. As long as we accept Holy Scripture as our
      rule of faith and practice, we can never write off the return of Jesus as a
      faded vision. The inhabitants of this planet have been living in the solemn
      period of God's judgment since 1844. (See Daniel 7, 8, and 9.) During
      this heavenly court session the three special messages of Revelation 14:6-
      14 have been sounding throughout the world in ever-increasing strength,
      appealing to earth's millions to "fear God" and to accept His final offer of
      grace. Only thus can they be brought into harmony with their Creator and
      Redeemer and prepared for Christ's glorious return.
         The years have elapsed. But we know where we are in the prophetic
      stream of time. Christ's return is just as certain to take place in God's
      proper time as was the fall of Jerusalem and Judah. Their ruin had been
      predicted more than 150 years earlier.

         We can hasten the Advent. "By giving the gospel to the world it is
      in our power to hasten our Lord's return. We are not only to look for
      but to hasten the coming of the day of God. 2 Peter 3:12, margin. Had
      the church of Christ done her appointed work as the Lord ordained, the
      whole world would before this have been warned, and the Lord Jesus
      38
 The Certainty of God's Word                                        May 4
would have come to our earth in power and great glory."—The Desire
of Ages, pp. 633, 634.

   If a parent warns a child that punishment will surely follow the
child's disobedience, what happens to the child's development if the
punishment is not administered? Why, then, does God not act immedi-
ately after announcing His judgments on sinful people and nations?
(See Eccl. 8:11.)

IV. PRESENT VISIONS OF FUTURE EVENTS (Eze. 12:26-28).

   "Faith has the power to make the distant near. It obliterates distance of
time and space. But unbelief reverses the effect. It looks in at the wrong
end of the telescope, and reduces realities to a mere speck."—H. D. M.
Spence, ed., Pulpit Commentary, Homily on Ezekiel 12:21-28 (Chicago:
Wilcox & Follett Co., n.d.), vol. 1 on Ezekiel, p. 223.

12. Looking through the wrong end of the telescope, as it were, how
    did other Jews attempt to dampen the force of Ezekiel's warn-
    ings? Eze. 12:27.



   The prophecies are not denied; they simply are put off to the distant fu-
ture. Unbelief leads to procrastination, an evil as serious as open rejection.

13. What is God's answer to this form of unbelief expressed by some
    of the people? Eze. 12:28.



    "The appropriateness of this section [Eze. 12:21-28] to current views
on the second coming of our Lord is remarkable. Some who hear the
Christian assertions that Christ will return to this earth react by saying that
more than 1,900 years have passed without anything happening and so the
doctrine may be safely ignored. Others consider that it is such a futuristic
concept that it need have no relevance to the world in which they presently
live. Both views are dangerous, because both ignore the immediacy of
prophecy. Whether fulfillment is a long time coming or is near at hand,
the church which receives such prophecy has a duty to live in the light of
its fulfillment."—John B. Taylor, Ezekiel (Downers Grove, Ill.: InterVar-
sity Press, 1969), p. 119.
    (See Eze. 24:1-14 for a description of the fulfillment of the Lord's pre-
dictions.)

14. What commonly happens to Christian experience if the attitude is
    adopted that Christ's coming is a long way off? Matt. 24:48-51
    (compare Luke 12:45, 46; 21:34).



                                                                            39
 Lesson 5                                                          May 4
   "The world, full of rioting, full of godless pleasure, is asleep, asleep in
carnal security. Men are putting afar off the coming of the Lord. They
laugh at warnings. The proud boast is made, 'All things continue as they
were from the beginning.' Tomorrow shall be as this day, and much more
abundant.' 2 Peter 3:4; Isa. 56:12."—The Desire of Ages, p. 635.

CHALLENGING QUESTIONS:
   • In what ways should my hope in Christ's soon return affect my pre-
sent pattern of living? (See Titus 2:11-14; Luke 12:31-40; compare Matt.
6:19-21.)
   • .Could failure by the church to carry out its mission prevent the day
of the Lord from coming? Explain.
   • Why is time not as great a factor in the Lord's plans as it is in ours?
(See 2 Peter 3:8.)
   • Some Christians teach that Christ is coming "at any moment" in the
secret rapture. Does this approach help to keep people prepared for the
Second Advent?

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read "On the Mount of
Olives" in The Desire of Ages, pp. 627-636. Compare Ezekiel 24:1, 2
with 2 Kings 25:1 and Jeremiah 52:4. January 15, 588 B.C. marked the
beginning of an eighteen-month siege by the Babylonians. Jerusalem fell
on July 19, 586 B.C.

SUMMARY: Judah's rebels sought to prevent the Lord's predicted judg-
ments by strengthening the city's defenses. Others argued that the prophets
had been proclaiming the end for more than a century, yet nothing had ever
happened. Still others acknowledged that ruin would come, but it would be
in the far-distant future. But within five years Jerusalem lay in ruins, and
the people were scattered into captivity.
   The church must not misread its lesson. The prophetic forecast of the
Second Advent must be taken seriously.

   God's Ideal for Leaders

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ezekiel 13; 21:25-27; 22:23-31

SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "I sought for a man among them, that should
 PM   make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land,
      that I should not destroy it: but I found none" (Ezekiel 22:30).

THE NEED FOR STRONG LEADERS. Why are most people attracted
to strong leaders? What potential effect does this natural phenomenon have
on the church and on the eternal well-being of its members?

OUTLINE:
   I. False Prophets of Peace (Eze. 13:1-9, 17-23; 22:25).
  11. Follow the Leader (Isa. 3:12).
 I11. Whitewashed Delusions (Eze. 13:10-16; 22:28).
 IV. Priestly Hypocrisy (Eze. 22:26).
  V. Kingly Compromise (Eze. 21:25-27).

LEADERSHIP IS SERVICE. Clara Barton (1821-1912), who later be-
came the dynamic founder of the American Red Cross, was a semi-invalid
at the time of the American Civil War. The living conditions of the un-
trained troops who straggled daily into Washington, and the suffering of
the wounded and dying on bloody battlefields, galvanized into action this
minor clerk in the U.S. Patent Office. Her latent energies embraced a cause
worthy of her highest gifts. The agonies of thousands of human beings
gave birth to a leader.
    Obtaining military permission to take food, medical supplies, and nurs-
ing aid directly to the combat areas, Clara organized her helpers, who
eventually included even court-martialed prisoners, to save as many lives
as possible. The free expenditure of her physical strength fired the energies
of her associates and prompted grateful troops to hail her the "Angel of
the Battlefield."
    Clara Barton was a leader. She perceived the need of the hour, saw how
it could be met, found ways around opposition, and aroused and organized
others to join her in meeting the challenge.
    There is always room for courageous leaders who see and meet needs,
whether or not the task is popular. This is true in the church. From every
area of life God calls for leaders, absolutely loyal to Him, who will rally
His people to spiritual exploits in the war of righteousness against sin.
    When Judah's leaders experienced a strong religious life, the people
 were drawn to give their lives wholly in obedience to the Lord. When the
                                                                          41
 Lesson 6                                                        May 11
leaders apostatized, their influence opened the floodgates of sin for the na-
tion. In this lesson we look over the shoulder of Ezekiel to see for our-
selves the almost unbelievable situation in the sixth century B.C.—the
apostasy of Judah's kings, priests, and prophets.

I. FALSE PROPHETS OF PEACE (Eze. 13:1-9, 17-23; 22:25).

1. From where did the false prophets derive their messages? Why are
   they called "foxes"? Eze. 13:1-4 (compare Song of Solomon 2:15;
   Luke 13:32).



   The Bible often mentions false prophets. A false prophet is really not a
prophet at all! Such a person may claim to have a message from God, but
in truth it is only a pretense. False prophets speak "out of their own
hearts," "follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing." God character-
izes them as "foxes," which suggests a sly, crafty, cunning nature capable
of deceiving.

2. What had these supposed prophets failed to do in the current
   crisis that was about to bring "the day of the Lord" upon Judah?
   What was Judah's "hedge"? Eze. 13:5 (compare Matt. 21:33).



   The hedge was the principles of the law. "To this people [the Jews]
were committed the oracles of God. They were hedged about by the pre-
cepts of His law, the everlasting principles of truth, justice, and purity.
Obedience to these principles was to be their protection, for it would save
them from destroying themselves by sinful practices."—Christ's Object
Lessons, pp. 287, 288.

   False prophets took no genuine interest in the spiritual well-being of the
nation. They made no attempt to reprove the people or to correct their way-
wardness. Instead they prophesied in the name of the Lord that which
people wanted to hear. (See Jer. 5:30, 31; 23:9-32.)

3. How did God regard the predictions and teachings of these false
   prophets? Eze. 13:6-8. How seriously did He regard their claim?
   Eze. 13:9.



4. What was the "message" of the false prophets? Eze. 13:10, 16.
   What effect would such messages have on the people in Jerusalem
   and the captives already in exile?



     The false prophets were prophets of "peace." They boldly predicted
42
        God's Ideal for Leaders                                       May 11
      that in two years Babylon's threat would be broken, the exiles and their
      imprisoned King Jehoiachin (Jeconiah)—along with the Temple vessels—
      would be restored. (See Jer. 27:16, 17; 28:1-11.) Such assurances kept the
      exiles in a state of restlessness and led no one—either in Jerusalem or in
      captivity—to repent of their sins against God. Neither Jeremiah nor
      Ezekiel could prove the peace movement to be false. They could only in-
      sist that God had spoken doom upon the nation.
MON   5. Who joined with the false prophets to influence the people to
         reject the messages of Jeremiah and Ezekiel? Eze. 13:17-23.



         This is one of only two Bible passages that refer to false prophetesses.
      The other reference is to Noadiah, a prophetess who hindered Nehemiah in
      his work (Neh. 6:14). Some commentators suggest that these women func-
      tioned as sorceresses, as did the witch of Endor. (See 1 Sam. 28:7.) That
      such a class of persons flourished openly in Judah was an affront to God
      and another evidence of the deep depravity into which the nation had sunk.

         Satan's strategy is to allure God's people into compromise with sin.
      He seeks to discourage loyal persons who see apostasy among church
      leaders and laity. Because God does not seem to intervene, the tempta-
      tion is strong to give up the faith with a shrug: "What's the use?"
      How can the Christian resist despondendency in the kind of cir-
      cumstances faced by Ezekiel, Jeremiah, and Daniel? (See Hebrews
      10:35-39.)

         "We must cherish and cultivate the faith of which prophets and apos-
      tles have testified—the faith that lays hold on the promises of God and
      waits for deliverance in His appointed time and way. The sure word of
      prophecy will meet its final fulfillment in the glorious advent of our Lord
      and Saviour Jesus Christ."—Prophets and Kings, p. 387.

      11. FOLLOW THE LEADER (Isa. 3:12).

      6. False prophets and teachers have always troubled God's people.
         What did Peter predict would be the situation in the Christian
         church? 2 Peter 2:1-3.



         False prophets and teachers seem to appear in times of crisis when
      God's people are agitated and looking for answers. The Bible summarizes
      the characteristics of false leaders:
          a. They appear genuine. They express sincerity, spirituality, and great
      concern for your soul. They appear in "sheep's clothing" as "ministers of
      righteousness" (Matt. 7:15; 2 Cor. 11:13-15).
          b. They present a message of their own devising. It may be difficult at
      first to perceive it as a mixture of truth and error. (See Eze. 13:2, 3.)
          c. They tend to tell the people what they want to hear, not necessarily
                                                                               43
 Lesson 6                                                       May 11
what they need to hear. (See Isa. 30:10; Eze. 13:22.)
   d. They may be mercenary; interested in receiving money from the
people. (See Eze. 22:25; Micah 3:11.)
   e. Although appearing righteous on the surface, they may conceal an
immoral lifestyle. (See Jer. 29:15, 23.)
   f. They cannot forever hide the falsity of their teaching. Good fruit does
not come from a corrupt tree. Eventually the spiritual and practical effects
of the teaching will come to light. (See Matt. 7:15-20.)
   g. They may succeed in ensnaring some dedicated people. (See Matt.
24:24.)

7. Christians often think that attacks against the faith come from op-
   ponents outside the church. From where did the apostles see the
   chief danger of deception arising? Acts 20:29-31 (compare 1 Tim.
   4:1; 2 Peter 2:1).



    "Satan hopes to involve the remnant people of God in the general ruin
that is coming upon the earth. As the coming of Christ draws nigh, he will
be more determined and decisive in his efforts to overthrow them. Men
and women will arise professing to have some new light or some new rev-
elation whose tendency is to unsettle faith in the old landmarks. Their doc-
trines will not bear the test of God's word, yet souls will be deceived."—
Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 295.

8. What is it that enables false prophets and teachers to be success-
   ful? Jer. 5:30, 31 (compare 2 Tim. 4:3, 4).



    A leader ceases to be one as soon as no one follows. If the rank and file
of Judah had rejected the erroneous teachings of the false prophet and had
listened to Jeremiah and Ezekiel, the influence of the former would have
faded. The people themselves set the agenda: they wanted to hear "smooth
things."
    The apostle Paul observes that in the end time, there will be among
God's people those whose ears "itch" to hear something other than the old
truths (see 2 Tim. 4:3). Such persons create the climate for false ministers,
teachers, and prophets to ravage the church.

   What should be the function of the church organization in respect
to prophets and teachers who teach contrary to the faith of the church
body? (See Acts 15:1, 2, 5, 23-29.)

I11. WHITEWASHED DELUSIONS (Eze. 13:10-16; 22:28).

9. How did the Lord graphically illustrate to Ezekiel the apostasy of
   the people? What did the prophets contribute? What false impres-
   sion did this render? Eze. 13:10, 16.

44
        God's Ideal for Leaders                                         May 11
         The Hebrew word translated "wall" (verse 10) refers to an inner parti-
      tion, a flimsy structure in comparison with an outside, load-bearing wall. It
      symbolized the deep-seated hope of the people that war with Babylon
      would cease. In forming an alliance with Egypt, they expected the Baby-
      lonians to be defeated and the threatened destruction by Babylon to be
      averted. Then all the captives—including the former king—would return
      to the land of Judah.
         The prophets are said to have painted this wall of false hopes "with
      untempered mortar." The Hebrew word here really means "white-
      wash." On the wall of the people's false hopes the misguided leaders
      smeared the whitewash of their prophecies of "peace." The endorse-
      ment of these false hopes by these so-called prophets reacted upon the
      people, making them more sure than ever that peace for the nation
      was just around the corner. Thus the people rejected appeals for re-
      pentance.

WED   10. What did God say would happen to their whitewashed wall?
          What did the stormy wind and hailstones symbolize? What would
          happen to the false prophets? Eze. 13:11-16.



         Whitewashed walls of delusion are common in religious circles. Major
      delusions will be the means of uniting forces of evil against forces of right-
      eousness in the final conflict over truth and error.

      11. What two whitewashed delusions have been largely accepted by
          Christians? See Gen. 3:4; Ex. 20:8-11 (compare Dan. 7:25).



          For many Christians the glorious results of Christ's resurrection are
      blurred by the belief that death is only another form of life, more wonder-
      ful than our present "vale of tears." Despite its wide acceptance, the doc-
      trine of the immortality of the soul is not taught in Scripture. (See 1 Tim.
      6:16; 1 Cor. 15:51-54.)
          The Bible does not teach Sunday observance, despite its acceptance by
      most Christians. Jesus and the apostles kept the Sabbath, and Jesus com-
      manded His followers to observe it after His death. (See Matt. 24:20.)

         Two major deceptions of the last days. "Through the two great
      errors, the immortality of the soul and Sunday sacredness, Satan will
      bring the people under his deceptions. While the former lays the founda-
      tion of spiritualism, the latter creates a bond of sympathy with Rome.
      The Protestants of the United States will be foremost in stretching their
      hands across the gulf to grasp the hand of spiritualism; they will reach
      over the abyss to clasp hands with the Roman power; and under the in-
      fluence of this threefold union, this country will follow in the steps of
      Rome in trampling on the rights of conscience."—The Great Con-
      troversy, p. 588.

                                                                                 45
 Lesson 6                                                         May 11
IV. PRIESTLY HYPOCRISY (Eze. 22:26).

12. Along with their mediatorial task, what other important work
    was entrusted to the priests and Levites? Mal. 2:7, 8 (compare
    2 Chron. 15:3; 17:7-9).



   One of the important duties of the priests and Levites was teaching the
people the truths of their religion from the law of Moses. God intended the
people to understand the symbolism of the sanctuary so that they could lay
hold of the gospel. (See Heb. 4:1, 2.)

13. To what sad state had the priesthood degenerated by the time of
    Ezekiel? Eze. 22:26 (compare 2 Chron. 36:14).



   It must have been painful for Ezekiel, a priest himself, to write this in-
dictment of the temple priesthood. The very defenders and expounders of
God's written revelation were themselves grossly guilty of transgressing it.

   Why is the priestly ministry of Christ so important to Christians
today?

   "The intercession of Christ in man's behalf in the sanctuary above is as
essential to the plan of salvation as was His death upon the cross. . . . Jesus
has opened the way to the Father's throne, and through His mediation the
sincere desire of all who come to Him in faith may be presented before
God."—The Great Controversy, p. 489.

V. KINGLY COMPROMISE (Eze. 21:25-27).

  Zedekiah reigned 11 years as the twentieth and last ruler of Judah (597-
586 B.C.). He engaged in the evil practices of his times and was only a
nominal worshiper of the true God. (See 2 Kings 24:17-20.)

14. When Nebuchadnezzar appointed Zedekiah to the throne, what
    did he have the young prince promise? In whose name? 2 Chron.
    36:13. Why did God view Zedekiah's violation of his promise so
    seriously? Eze. 17:11-19.



   Although Nebuchadnezzar was a pagan, he had been deeply impressed
by the witness of Daniel and his three companions to the God of Israel. He
doubtless took advantage of the situation and caused Zedekiah to swear al-
legiance to him in the name of Jehovah, thinking that the prince would be
as loyal to his word as were Daniel and his friends. Zedekiah's subsequent
rebellion besmirched the character of the true God in the eyes of the pagan
king. Zedekiah's broken word made his punishment more certain.
46
  God's Ideal for Leaders                                       May 11
15. What ruin did covenant-breaking King Zedekiah bring upon the
    ruling house of David? Who will one day assume the fallen
    crown? Eze. 21:25-27 (compare Luke 1:30-33).



APPLYING THE LESSON:
   • Should all promises be kept? Explain. (See Testimonies, vol. 5, p.
365.)
   • In what practical ways can I determine that a person is a false
prophet or teacher and is not to be followed?
   • Why is the performance of miracles not a trustworthy sign of a
genuine teacher from the Lord? (See Ex. 7:10-12, 22; Rev. 16:14; John
10:41.)
   • Some leaders may fall into apostasy. Why is such behavior not a
valid reason for my giving up faith in Jesus Christ and His special message
for this time? (See Matt. 16:24; 23:1-3.)

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read "The Last King of
Judah" in Prophets and Kings, pp. 440-451.

SUMMARY: The spiritual and ethical collapse of Judah's leaders con-
tributed to the downfall of the nation. The challenge for us is twofold: (1)
that every church officer should provide a noble example that can be safely
followed by individuals and by the membership in general. (See 1 Cor.
11:1.) (2) that every member should be true to his or her faith in the Word
of God, regardless of what others may do or fail to do. The false leaders in
Israel were not entirely responsible for the apostasy; the people were
happy to go in the wrong direction. Every member of the church has the
sacred responsibility of correctly representing God to the world.

  Individual Responsibility

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ezekiel 14:12-23; 15; 18.

SAB   MEMORY TEST: "As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no
 PM   pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn
      from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for
      why will ye die, 0 house of Israel?" (Ezekiel 33:11).

DO THE INNOCENT ALWAYS SUFFER WITH THE GUILTY? Al-
though judgment may fall upon a group of persons (such as the nation of
Judah) because of their widespread rebellion against God, can individuals
within that group be saved? How do individual and corporate responsibili-
ties relate to each other?

OUTLINE:
   I. Insurance Policy for Sinners? (Eze. 14:12-23).
  11. God Has No Grandchildren (Eze. 14:14, 16, 18, 20).
 I11. A Lesson From Agriculture (Ezekiel 15).
 IV. The Proverb of the Sour Grapes (Ezekiel 18).

WE ARE INDIVIDUALLY RESPONSIBLE. "Mary, I have but one
thing more to say. The day you go out these doors to be baptized and to
join those religious cranks, just plan not to return. This will no longer be
your home. I'll not want to see you again."
   Mary had been attending evangelistic meetings. Evening after evening
she had learned new truth. She enjoyed it! It all was firmly based upon the
Bible. But strong opposition developed from her husband. John felt the
family's social standing in the community and his business connections
were being injured by Mary's association with Adventists. As she contem-
plated baptism, he confronted her with his ultimatum.
   "What shall I do?" Mary asked the evangelist. His answer surprised
her: "Only you can make this decision. It must be your decision wholly. I
cannot counsel you to leave your husband, to go contrary to his will, to de-
stroy your home."
   "Can you give me any counsel at all?" Mary persisted. "Yes," replied
the evangelist, "follow your conscience; obey what you believe to be
God's will for you."
   "I believe God wants me to be baptized," responded Mary, "but what
about my husband?"
    "Does he know you believe the truths you have heard?" questioned the
evangelist.
    "Indeed he does," she affirmed.
                                                                         49

   "Well, then what will he think about your religion if you do not carry
out what you believe?"
   "Oh," replied Mary, "I never thought of that! Yes, for his own sake I
must do what God has shown me to be right." (Adapted. Carlyle B.
Haynes, "When Joining the Church Might Destroy Your Home," Review
and Herald, November 1, 1956, pp. 16ff.)
   Under the leading of the Holy Spirit, Mary sensed the fundamental truth
that we are individually responsible before the Creator. She also sensed the
strong influence that personal decisions have on others. Mary took her
stand for God and was baptized. To her great joy and amazement she saw
her faithfulness to God lead to the baptism of her husband and the strength-
ening of her home.
   Our study in Ezekiel this week centers on the principle of individual re-
sponsibility.

I. INSURANCE POLICY FOR SINNERS? (Eze. 14:12-23).

   Can the presence of a few godly individuals avert divine judgment for
the mass of rebellious sinners? Evidently some people of Jerusalem were
reasoning in this manner in order to calm the fears of the people. John Tay-
lor suggests that this "attitude is nothing less than using the saints as an in-
surance policy to cover the sinners."—John B. Taylor, Ezekiel (Downer's
Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press, 1969), p. 128.

1. What example did the Jews have in their own history that would
   make such reasoning seem plausible? Gen. 18:23-26, 32.



   In recalling the Lord's response to Abraham that He would spare
Sodom for the sake of ten righteous persons, we should keep in mind the
differences between the people of Sodom and the people of Jerusalem.
What was the major difference?

2. How does the New Testament imply that the presence of righteous
   persons brings a certain protection to the unrighteous around
   them? Acts 27:24, 37 (compare Matt. 5:13).



   For the apostle Paul's sake 275 persons making up the crew and pas-
sengers on board the ship with him were spared death at sea.

   Salt preserves. "Hearts that respond to the influence of the Holy Spirit
are the channels through which God's blessing flows. Were those who
serve God removed from the earth, and His Spirit withdrawn from among
men, this world would be left to desolation and destruction, the fruit of
Satan's dominion. . . . But if Christians are such in name only, they are like
the salt that has lost its savor. They have no influence for good in the
world. Through their misrepresentation of God they are worse than un-
believers."—The Desire of Ages, p. 306.

MON   3. Why is it not inconsistent for God to state that the presence of
         Noah, Daniel, and Job would not avert the doom He had
         pronounced on Judah? Eze. 14:12-21.



         Note that the divine judgment is to fall upon God's land that has sinned
      against Him, "trespassing grievously" (verse 13). Four judgments are
      mentioned: famine (verse 13); wild beasts (verse 15); sword (verse 17);
      and pestilence (verse 19). Linked with each of these judgments is the
      solemn assertion that the presence of these holy men could not prevent it
      (verses 14, 16, 18, 20). Consequently, they could not prevent the destruc-
      tion of the city and nation when all four judgments fell at the same time
      (verse 21; compare Jer. 15:1).

         God is consistent. As long as righteous persons function effectively as
      salt, God will spare sinners. But Judah was sin-hardened beyond normal
      means of recovery. Even Noah had been unable to save the evil race before
      the Flood (2 Peter 2:5). Job did not save the lives of his sons and daughters
      (Job 1:4, 5, 18, 19). Nor could Daniel prevent the Babylonian destruction
      of Judah, although he was a respected wise man in the court of Nebuchad-
      nezzar (Dan. 9:5-7). In the final hardening of the world in defiance of the
      Creator, the presence of God's remnant people will not prevent the falling
      of the seven last plagues.

      4. There would be some escapees of the siege who would be brought
         as captives to join the other exiles in Babylonia. What effect would
         they have on the exiles already there? Eze. 14:22, 23.



         While probation continues, what can I personally do to attract my
      neighbors to Christ? (See The Desire of Ages, p. 307.)

      11. GOD HAS NO GRANDCHILDREN (Eze. 14:14, 16, 18, 20).

        There is a deeper significance to Ezekiel's statements about Noah, Job,
      and Daniel other than that their presence and intercessions could not pre-
      vent the divine judgment on Judah.

      5. What is implied in the statement that these saintly men shall
         deliver neither sons nor daughters—but only themselves? Eze.
         14:16, 18, 20.



      • Elder H. M. S. Richards, Sr., founder and director of the Voice of
      Prophecy, often said, "God has no grandchildren, only children." His
      statement reflects Ezekiel's meaning: no one can choose salvation for
      another. We are individually responsible before God and must accept
      Christ as Saviour and Lord for ourselves. No one can enter the kingdom of
                                                                                51
       Lesson 7                                                          May 18
     heaven on the coattails of relatives or friends. All God's people are His
     children through personal choice and the new birth.

IN 6. How does one become a child of God and part of His family? John
        1:12; 3:16 (compare Rom. 10:9-13; 1 John 3:1).



        "It is the first and highest duty of every rational being to learn from the
     Scriptures what is truth, and then to walk in the light and encourage others
     to follow his example. We should day by day study the Bible diligently,
     weighing every thought and comparing scripture with scripture. With
     divine help we are to form our opinions for ourselves as we are to answer
     for ourselves before God."—The Great Controversy, p. 598.

     7. How does Jesus illustrate this principle of individual respon-
        sibility? Matt. 25:8, 9.



        "In spiritual things no man can make up another's deficiency. The
     grace of God has been freely offered to every soul. The message of the
     gospel has been heralded, 'Let him that is athirst come. And whosoever
     will, let him take the water of life freely.' But character is not transferable.
     No man can believe for another. No man can receive the Spirit for another.
     No man can impart to another the character which is the fruit of the Spirit's
     working."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 411, 412.
     8. How did Noah, Job, and Daniel develop such sturdy characters?
        Or was it a matter of chance? Compare Gen. 6:9; Heb. 11:7; Job
        23:10-12; Dan. 6:10.



        Godly parents taught these men the ways of the Lord when they were
     children, but the parents could not decide for the children. The evidence is
     that they themselves chose to walk with God, to obey faithfully His com-
     mands, to pray daily, and to study His written Word. They chose to exer-
     cise personal faith in the God of heaven.
        The character that God respects involves righteousness by faith. (See
     Phil. 3:9-11.) By faith we choose to obey God's Word rather than natural
     impulses of the flesh. Faith is not chance. By faith the righteousness of
     Christ is bestowed upon us by the Holy Spirit. (See Romans 8.) Christ's
     character becomes ours because He lives out His life through us. (See Gal.
     2:20.) Although our wills are involved in choosing Christ and resisting evil
     (James 4:7; Heb. 12:4), Christ's grace, given to us when we believe, is the
     only means by which we become and remain children of God.

        Although we cannot choose salvation for our children or for those
     with whom we associate, what can we do, while leaving the Holy Spirit
     to bring conviction? (See Deut. 6:6, 7; Titus 2:7, 8.)

WED   I11. A LESSON FROM AGRICULTURE (Ezekiel 15).

       9. What figure is commonly used in the Old Testament to describe
          the nation of Israel? Ps. 80:8, 9 (compare Jer. 2:21; Isa. 5:1-7).



         Evidently some reasoned that Judah was special to God, like a choice
      vine planted in a fertile vineyard, and that He would protect it from being
      trampled by the wild Babylonian boar.

      10. How did God pointedly demonstrate to the Jewish captives the
          worthlessness of vine wood? Eze. 15:1-5. What is the real value of
          a grapevine? Whom does the vine represent in this prophecy?
          Eze. 15:6.



         Ezekiel's parable of the vine applied to Judah as a corporate unity. The
      sinful nation had no superiority over other nations, and its barren wood
      was soon to be consumed.

      11. How did Jesus use the same figure of a vine to demonstrate in-
          dividual responsibility? John 15:1-8. Who represents the vine-
          stock? Who are the branches? What enables the individual
          branches to bear fruit? How does the believer "abide" in the
          vine?



         Our sustenance comes from Christ. "One branch is not to borrow its
      sustenance from another. Our life must come from the parent vine. It is
      only by personal union with Christ, by communion with Him daily, hourly,
      that we can bear the fruits of the Holy Spirit. . . . Our growth in grace, our
      joy, our usefulness, all depend on our union with Christ and the degree of
      faith we exercise in Him."—Sons and Daughters of God, p. 290.

        To avoid being worthless vine wood—a Christian in name only—
      what daily devotions will enable the Holy Spirit to enrich my life with
      His good fruits?

      IV. THE PROVERB OF THE SOUR GRAPES (Ezekiel 18).

         No longer able to evade her punishment, Judah blames God for being
      unfair. Again her argument is summarized in a proverb: "The fathers have
      eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge" (Eze. 18:2).
         Simply stated, the complaint was this: We are innocent children suffer-
      ing and being punished for the sins of our fathers. It is useless to repent,
      because we are not guilty. We are being punished unfairly for the sins of
      King Manasseh and his generation. (See Jer. 15:4.) In other words, the
      sensitive teeth of the children symbolized the consequences—the suffering
                                                                                 53
 Lesson 7                                                            May 18
and discipline they were receiving—for things they had never done. The
fathers should be held accountable for their own crimes (eating the sour
grapes).

12. In what sense is this widespread proverb true? Ex. 20:4-6 (com-
    pare Gal. 6:6, 7).



   The proverb of the sour grapes is true when it is applied to the laws of
heredity. Modern scientific affirmation of the second commandment may
be seen in warnings on some packs of cigarettes in the United States:
"Surgeon General's Warning: Smoking by Pregnant Women May Result
in Fetal Injury, Premature Birth, and Low Birth Weight."
   "God does not interfere with the laws of heredity in such a way as to
protect one generation from the misdeeds of its fathers, as that would be in-
consistent with His character and His principles of dealing with men. It is
only through these laws of heredity . .. that divine justice visits the 'iniquity'
of one generation upon the next."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 603.
   "It is inevitable that children should suffer from the consequences of
parental wrongdoing, but they are not punished for the parents' guilt, ex-
cept as they participate in their sins."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 306.

13. In what sense was the proverb being misused by the Jews? Com-
    pare the civil law God had instituted through Moses. Deut. 24:16.
    How did the Lord regard the misuse of the proverb by the
    people? Eze. 18:1-4.



   Ezekiel's contemporaries hid behind this proverb to escape their own
personal responsibility for the ruin of the nation. In fact, the children were
sinning more seriously than their fathers and would reap a "whirlwind" of
consequences. (See 2 Chron. 36:14-17.) There was a remedy, a "balm in
Gilead" (Jer. 8:22), but the people did not want it. Their condition was ter-
minal.

14. What three cases does the Lord use to illustrate the law of in-
    dividual responsibility? Eze. 18:5-18. Note the key thought the
    Lord is emphasizing in Ezekiel 18:4, 20.



   The three prominent kings who ruled in the last century of Judah's ex-
istence illustrate God's message. Hezekiah was a good king, but his son
Manasseh became one of the nation's most wicked rulers, even though he
later repented. On the other hand, Josiah chose not to follow the example
of his father, Amon, or his grandfather, Manasseh.

15. If a person could turn away from his father's sins and be ac-
    cepted, could he also repent and turn away from his own sins and
54
 Individual Responsibility                                      May 18
    receive the Lord's forgiveness? Eze. 18:21-23, 27, 28. What warn-
    ing did God give the righteous person? Eze. 18:24-26. What light
    does a parable told by Jesus shed on this subject? Matt. 18:23-35.



   "It is true that he [the unforgiving servant] may once have received for-
giveness; but his unmerciful spirit shows that he now rejects God's par-
doning love. He has separated himself from God, and is in the same condi-
tion as before he was forgiven. He has denied his repentance, and his sins
are upon him as if he had not repented."—Christ' s Object Lessons, p. 251.

16. What passionate plea did God make to His people? Can one
    change his own heart? Eze. 18:30-32 (compare Eze. 11:19).



HOW DOES THIS LESSON APPLY TO ME?
   • What would be the consequences for me, if I took seriously Israel's
misinterpretation of the proverb of the sour grapes? Why is the law of in-
dividual responsibility (free moral agency) a real boon to the human
family?
   • Although I cannot believe for another person, how can I contribute to
his or her salvation?
   • Why do children who are well trained by godly parents sometimes
choose a worldly life?
   • How is the law of heredity a deterrent to sinning? What influence
should this fact have on my conduct?

FURTHER READING AND MEDITATION: Read "Worldly Ambi-
tion" in Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 336-341.

SUMMARY: Although at times God must deal with corporate entities, we
are saved as individuals. Like Mary, in the introduction to our lesson, we
must study the Bible for ourselves and make that personal choice to accept
Him as Saviour and Lord.

     The Ministry of Memory

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ezekiel 16; 20; 23.

SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a
 PM
      bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without
      number" (Jeremiah 2:32).

WHY SHOULD WE RECALL THE PAST? Although we may wish to
forget some things, what value do memories of past experiences have for
our spiritual well-being?

OUTLINE: •
   I. From Rags to Riches (Eze. 16:1-43).
  11. Like Mother, Like Daughter (Eze. 16:43-63).
 I11. Try, Try Again (Ezekiel 20).
 IV. A Tale of Two Sisters (Ezekiel 23).

THE LORD REMINDS US OF HIS PAST BLESSINGS. We know her
only as "Sister M," a young mother converted to the Seventh-day Advent-
ist Christian faith. Ellen White sketches her experience.
    Unfortunately, liquor blighted the home, when her once noble-minded
husband turned into a raging alcoholic. Abuse and violence took the place
of love and kindness. Pressed by poverty, Sister M struggled to support the
family. Alcohol had shattered home and health, but she had found strength
and calmness in God's grace.
    Sister M's health continued to deteriorate. On her deathbed, she ap-
pealed to her Adventist church elders to pray for her recovery, as James 5
instructs. The Lord honored their earnest petitions; Sister M recovered
completely.
    Although she remained in "the school of adversity," her faith and spir-
ituality deepened. She became an effective witness for Christ. When she
prayed for financial means to assist the needy people around her and to
support the Lord's work, God answered her prayers.
    She became successful in business, but as means began to flow into her
hands, faith and trust in God began to wane. Her new house and worldly
friendships enticed her away from Christ. Neglecting her devotional life,
she gradually lost her spiritual moorings. Unwittingly, her talents of in-
fluence and money became a barrier between her and God.
    At this point, through the prophetic gift, God appealed to Sister M to re-
member His past leading in her life. He pleaded with her to repent, lest, as
a means of saving her, He would allow her wealth to be scattered. We do
56
  The Ministry of Memory                                       May 25
not know what response Sister M made to the Lord's plea. Hopefully,
memories of the past ministered to bring her back to her Saviour. (Based
on Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 268-288.)
   Sister M's experience parallels that of Israel. The people had forgot-
ten how God had brought them out of Egyptian slavery, making them a
prosperous, happy people and an effective witness to the nations. Ungrate-
ful Israel allied herself with the surrounding pagan nations and in the
process lost her spirituality in the morass of heathenism.
   Now, as Judah faced complete ruin by the Babylonian armies, the Lord
sought once more to remind His people of their past history and His gra-
cious dealings with them. The ministry of an aroused memory might lead
a remnant to repentance and to return to Palestine from captivity.

I. FROM RAGS TO RICHES (Eze. 16:1-43).

   In Ezekiel 16 the Lord traces the spiritual history of Israel from her
origins in Egypt to Ezekiel's day.

1. Why do you think Ezekiel attributes the origin of the Israelite na-
   tion to Canaan and not to Mesopotamia, the original home of
   Abraham? Eze. 16:1-3 (compare John 8:33, 37, 39, 44).



   "Early pre-Israelite kings of Jerusalem had Amorite and Hittite names.
This ethnic background was Jerusalem's nativity. Ezekiel's language is a
strong taunt to the people of Jerusalem, who boasted descent from
Abraham, but who acted as if descended from the earlier heathen inhabi-
tants of what was afterward the land of Israel. Resemblance in character
was of transcendent importance compared with mere lineal descent"—
SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 627.

2. What period in Israel's history is depicted by the symbol of the
   unwanted foundling? Eze. 16:4, 5. What may this exposure of a
   newborn infant allude to? See Ex. 1:22; Acts 7:19. Who
   "discovered" the infant and twice commanded that it "live"?
   Eze. 16:6.



   The allegory probably describes Israel's beginnings as a nation in
Egypt. As the people multiplied, the Egyptian authorities instituted a sys-
tematic destruction of Hebrew children, especially of male infants, com-
manding that the people dispose of them in the Nile River. This attempted
genocide was blocked by God, who commanded this "child"—His
people—to live. Because God overruled the attempt to destroy the fledg-
ling people, they "multiplied, and waxed very mighty" (Ex. 1:20).

3. How does the Lord describe His "marriage" to Israel and His
   subsequent care that resulted in her becoming an exceedingly
   beautiful "woman" among the nations? Eze. 16:8. When did the
                                                                        57
       Lesson 8                                                        May 25

           "marriage" take place? Ex. 19:1-9; 24:1-8.



         Although in a technical sense, Israel was already in covenant relation-
      ship with God through Abraham (Genesis 15, 17), it was at Sinai that God
      formally entered into covenant with Israel as an organized nation. The pe-
      riod between Sinai and the early years of the monarchy is viewed as the
      time during which God developed the nation and its resources.
         Believers in God are described as being in covenant relationship with
      Him. God figuratively compared this relationship to the marriage bond. He
      refers to "my covenant which they broke, though I was their husband"
      (Jer. 31:32, RSV).

MON   4. How does God describe Israel's idolatry? What did the nation do
         with her precious metals, products of the field and orchard, and
         even her children? Why is a believer's unfaithfulness to God
         described as a form of immorality? Eze. 16:15-25 (compare James
         4:4; 1 John 2:15-17).



         Excavations in Palestine have uncovered the ashes and skeletal remains
      of innumerable infants, mute testimony to the fact that Israel heartily em-
      braced the degrading, cruel, and idolatrous practices of the Canaanites.

      5. Having left her "first love," to whom did Israel reach out to form
         entangling alliances—both politically and spiritually? Eze. 16:26,
         28, 29 (compare 2 Chron. 28:16-23).



         Apostasy is repeatedly compared to adultery or harlotry, because by it
      the covenant bond is broken. Ezekiel notes three root causes for Israel's in-
      fidelity:
         a. Pride. "Thou didst trust in thine own beauty" (Eze. 16:15).
         b. Forge tfulness (ingratitude). "Thou hast not remembered the days of
      thy youth" (Eze. 16:22, 43).
         c. Irresolution. "How weak is thine heart" (Eze. 16:30).

      6. God likens the coming destruction of Jerusalem (Judah) to the ex-
         ecution of an adulterous woman. Who were appointed to be her
         executioners? What should God's people learn from this? Eze.
         16:35-42.



         Some of the very nations with whom Israel was allied and whose
      idolatry she embraced became her executioners. The lesson is clear:
      Whatever we allow to displace God from the center of our adoration, ulti-
      mately will bring about our spiritual ruin.

        Because she had forgotten what God had done for her, Israel
     turned to idolatry. What can we do to promote a true spirit of remem-
     brance, humility, and gratitude for God's saving love? (See Col. 2:6, 7;
     1 Cor. 11:24-26.)

        "Praise to God and the Lamb will be in our hearts and on our lips; for
     pride and self-worship cannot flourish in the soul that keeps fresh in
     memory the scenes of Calvary."—The Desire of Ages, p. 661.


si   11. LIKE MOTHER, LIKE DAUGHTER (Eze. 16:43-63).

     7. What new comparison does the Lord make in an attempt to arouse
        Judah to her terrible, sin-hardened condition? Eze. 16:45, 46.



        In the Bible, directions are usually described from an eastern orienta-
     tion. If one faces east, north is on the left (Samaria) and south is on the
     right (Sodom, verse 46). Samaria is called the "elder" (literally,
     "greater") and Sodom is called the "younger" (literally, "smaller").

     8. How did Judah compare with these two wicked areas? Eze. 16:47,
        48, 51, 52.



        When the Lord says that Samaria and Sodom "are more righteous"
     than Judah (verse 52), He does not mean they were sinless. In this striking
     comparison the Lord is underscoring the fact that Judah's guilt is greater
     than that of these nations; she had sinned against greater light and privi-
     leges. Compared with the horrendous depravity of Judah, however, Sodom
     and Samaria appeared innocent. Of course, all three were extremely
     wicked.

     9. Although judgment had fallen on Sodom and Samaria and was
        soon to fall on Judah, what promise did God make? Eze. 16:53-55.
        What covenant would the Lord establish with them? Eze. 16:60-63
        (compare Jer. 31:31-34).



        Samaria (the northern kingdom) was already in Assyrian captivity.
     Sodom and her neighboring cities had perished in the destruction that oc-
     curred in the days of Abraham and Lot. (See Genesis 19.) It is puzzling to
     know how God would "bring again" the captivity of Sodom (verse 53).
     Perhaps the reference is to the nearby countries of Moab and Ammon, the
     people of which were the descendants of Sodom through Lot. Both nations
     were conquered by Babylon. (See Ezekiel 25.)

        We are taught not to measure our spiritual experience by that of
     others, but by the life of Christ, the perfect Example (see 2 Cor. 10:12,
                                                                              59
       Lesson 8                                                         May 25
      18; Phil. 2:5). What then did God hope to accomplish by comparing
      Judah with Samaria and Sodom? What is the significance of this com-
      parison for us today?
WED   I11. TRY, TRY AGAIN (Ezekiel 20).

         The message of Ezekiel 20 was given approximately two years after
      God appointed Ezekiel to be His watchman to the house of Israel (see Eze.
      20:1). The elders are again present and desire to inquire of the Lord. But
      God refuses to be interrogated, instructing the prophet instead to "cause
      them to know the abominations of their fathers" (verses 2-4).

      10. When God set about to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian
          bondage, in what spiritual condition did He find them? How did
          they respond to His appeal to forsake their idolatry? Why did
          God deliver such a spiritually weak people? Eze. 20:5-9 (compare
          Ex. 6:1-8).



         "During all the years of servitude in Egypt, there had been among the
      Israelites some who adhered to the worship of Jehovah. These were sorely
      troubled as they saw their children daily witnessing the abominations of
      the heathen, and even bowing down to their false gods. In their distress
      they cried unto the Lord for deliverance from the Egyptian yoke, that they
      might be freed from the corrupting influence of idolatry. . . . But those who
      were true to God understood that it was because of Israel's departure from
      Him—because of their disposition to marry with heathen nations, thus
      being led into idolatry—that the Lord had permitted them to become bond-
      men."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 259, 260.

      11. Why do you think the observance of the Sabbath is mentioned
          several times in connection with idolatry? Eze. 20:10, 13, 16
          (compare Ex. 32:1-6). What is the timeless significance of the
          Sabbath? Eze. 20:12, 20; Ex. 31:13-17.



          "By causing men to violate the second commandment, Satan aimed to
      degrade their conceptions of the Divine Being. By setting aside the fourth,
      he would cause them to forget God altogether. God's claim to reverence
      and worship, above the gods of the heathen, is based upon the fact that He
      is the Creator, and that to Him all other beings owe their existence. . . . Had
      the Sabbath always been sacredly observed, there could never have been
      an atheist or an idolater."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 336.

      12. What did God say to the second generation of Israelites? How did
          they respond? Eze. 20:18-26.

    "The statutes the people had adopted, which were not good, came from .
the heathen round about them. But how can it be said that God gave these
to them? In Bible figure, many acts are attributed to God, not with the idea
that He actually performs them, but from the point of view that in His om-
nipotence and omniscience He does not prevent them. An understanding of
this principle helps to explain many apparently contradictory statements,
which like the one here under consideration, seem to contradict flatly the
Bible teaching that God's character is pure and holy."—SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 4, p. 647.

13. In spite of God's patience with Israel, what had been their his-
    tory in Canaan from the very beginning? Eze. 20:27, 28. In what
    respect were Ezekiel's contemporaries like their ancestors? Eze.
    20:30-32.



14. What would the Babylonian captivity finally accomplish for a
    remnant of the nation? Eze. 20:37, 38, 42, 43.



   What does Israel's persistent "love affair" with idolatry teach us
about: (1) the character of God; (2) the nature of sin and the need to
break with it at once; and (3) accountability for spiritual light and
blessing? (See 2 Cor. 6:14-18.)

IV. A TALE OF TWO SISTERS (Ezekiel 23).

   Ezekiel is instructed to take the exiles on a third review of their past his-
tory. He reverts to the parable (allegory) form of portrayal.

15. Whom do the two daughters represent? Who is the mother?
    What is the basic point of the allegory as stated in Ezekiel 23:1-
    4?



    This allegory of the two girls reveals that Israel's unnatural craving for
idolatry and the ways of the world began in Egypt long before the Exodus.
It eventually caused the ruin of both segments of the Israelite people.

16. With whom did Aholah (the northern kingdom) begin an entan-
    gling alliance? Eze. 23:5. What did these "lovers" eventually do
    to the nation? Eze. 23:9, 10 (compare 2 Kings 17:3-18, 23).



   One of the early alliances with Assyria was made by Jehu. By 722 B.C.
Samaria had fallen, and the bulk of the people were transported into differ-
ent parts of the Assyrian empire.
                                                                             61

17. Aholibah (Judah) is depicted as having an even greater desire for
    idolatry and pagan alliances. Eze. 23:11. How does the prophet
    describe the terrible depravity that developed? Eze. 23:35-39.
    What would be the fate of both women? Eze. 23:46-49.



HOW DOES THIS LESSON RELATE TO MY EXPERIENCE?
   • What can I do to prevent myself from becoming spiritually blind?
   • Why is it helpful in winning back former church members to remind
them of their baptism and earlier Christian experience?
   • How essential to my spiritual growth is my observance of the Sab-
bath?
   • Why does a Christian of modest means and education often have a
richer spiritual experience than a Christian of greater attainments?

SUMMARY: Israel drifted into idolatry and gross sin because she forgot
to cultivate her "first love." The ministry of memory can keep our rela-
tionship with God radiant and growing.

          Lord of the Nations

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ezekiel 25-30.
SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "Of a truth I perceive that God is no respec-
 PM
      ter of persons: but in every nation he that feareth him, and
      worketh righteousness, is accepted with him" (Acts 10:34, 35).

WHAT WORK DOES GOD DO FOR THE NATIONS OF EARTH?
Since the Creator is the Lord of all nations, did He show favoritism in
choosing Israel as His "firstborn" (Ex. 4:22)? What has He done for the
global family? On what basis does He hold the nations accountable for
their actions?

OUTLINE:
   I. The Creator's Children (Acts 17:26).
  11. Near Neighbors (Ezekiel 25).
 I11. Tyre and Prophecy (Ezekiel 26, 27).
 IV. The Power Behind the Throne (Ezekiel 28).
  V. The Broken Reed (Ezekiel 29, 30).

LOVE THAT EMBRACES ALL. As God intended to bring true liberty
to the world through His ancient people Israel, so He desires to dissemi-
nate gospel freedom through His church today. Jerusalem was placed "in
the midst of the nations and countries" (Eze. 5:5), on the land bridge be-
tween three continents: Africa, Asia, and Europe. She was to reveal to the
nations the truth about God and to draw them to His Temple, which God
designed to be "an house of prayer for all people" (Isa. 56:7). When the
Messiah came, His chosen people were to uphold Him to the world. Israel
was to be "a light to the Gentiles, . . . my salvation unto the end of the
earth" (Isa. 49:6). Christ was to be the Saviour, not only of Israel but also
"the Saviour of the world" (John 4:42; compare 1 John 2:2).
    The Lord of the nations is motivated by a divine love that embraces the
world's populations. He is no respecter of persons, but rejoices in saving
anyone who will be drawn to His saving Light (John 1:4, 5, 9; 8:12).

I. THE CREATOR'S CHILDREN (Acts 17:26).

1. Since the God of Israel is the only true God, what is His relation to
   the other nations of earth? Acts 17:26, 27. How much knowledge
   of God exists among the nations? Acts 14:15-17; Rom. 1:19, 20.

                                                                          63

   "God reveals Himself to man in three ways: by an internal revelation to
the reason and conscience of each man (Rom. 2:15; cf. John 1:9), by an
external revelation in the works of creation (Rom. 1:20), and by special
revelation in the Scriptures and in the person and work of Christ, which
confirms and completes the other revelations. Paul is here [Rom. 1:19, 20]
referring to the first two."—SDA Bible Commentaiy, vol. 6, p. 478.
   "With unerring accuracy the Infinite One still keeps account with the
nations. While His mercy is tendered, with calls to repentance, this account
remains open; but when the figures reach a certain amount which God has
fixed, the ministry of His wrath begins. The account is closed. Divine
patience ceases. Mercy no longer pleads in their behalf."—Prophets and
Kings, p. 364.

2. What is the ultimate plan for every human being? John 3:16. How
   did God intend to accomplish this mission in the period before the
   cross? Isa. 56:6, 7. How does God intend to accomplish it in the
   Christian era? Matt. 24:14



    "In proclaiming the truths of the everlasting gospel to every nation,
kindred, tongue, and people, God's church on earth today is fulfilling the
ancient prophecy, 'Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the
world with fruit.' The followers of Jesus, in cooperation with heavenly in-
telligences, are rapidly occupying the waste places of the earth; and as the
result of their labors, an abundant fruitage of precious souls is develop-
ing."—Prophets and Kings, p. 703.

11. NEAR NEIGHBORS (Ezeziel 25).

   The Jewish prophets warned of a coming "day of the Lord" that would
call to account the enemies of God's people. Ezekiel's messages about the
nations were given after the fall of Judah or while Jerusalem was under
siege. At the time, the destruction of the Israelite nation was for all practi-
cal purposes certain, if not already accomplished.
   The Lord allowed pagan nations to be instruments of His wrath against
His unfaithful people. The Lord did not cause their cruelty to Israel; He al-
lowed it by withdrawing His protection from the chosen nation. But be-
cause the nations that invaded Israel did not themselves respond to His
love and repent of their sins, God punished them also.

3. Why was God bringing judgment on the Ammonites? Eze. 25:1-7.
   Note especially verses 3 and 6.



   The Ammonites were blood-related to the Israelites, being descendants
of Lot and his younger daughter (Gen. 19:38). The nation lay on the edge
of the desert in Transjordan, east of Jericho. They were a cruel people,
sacrificing their children to the god Molech (see 1 Kings 11:7) and con-
tinually warring against the Israelites. Jephthah fought them (see Judges
64
      Lord of the Nations                                              June 1
    11). King Saul rescued the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead from the Am-
    monite plan to gouge out the right eye of every Israelite warrior in the city.
    (See 1 Sam. 11:1-11.) The Ammonites were also responsible for the
    murder of Gedaliah, appointed to govern Judah after the Babylonian con-
    quest in 586 B.C. (See Jer. 40:14; 41:1, 2.)

•   4. For what reason would God bring judgment on Moab, the other
       nation related to Israel through Lot (Gen. 19:37)? Eze. 25:8-11.



       While Ammon gloated over Judah's conquest, Moab sneered in con-
    tempt. In their eyes the conquest demonstrated that Judah was just like
    every other nation without any special commission and protection from the
    Lord. Shortly after Judah's fall both Ammon and Moab were overrun by
    the Arabian Nabateans and apparently ceased to exist as independent na-
    tions.

    5. Why did God pronounce judgment on the kingdom of Edom? Eze.
       25:12-14 (compare Obadiah 1, 10-14; Ps. 137:7).



       The Edomites were also blood-related to the Israelites through Esau,
    Jacob's twin brother (Gen. 25:30). They lived in the region between the
    southern end of the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Aqabah, the northeastern
    arm of the Red Sea. This area is sometimes referred to as Seir or Mount
    Seir. A long-standing feud existed between these brother nations. The
    Edomites adopted a vengeful spirit against Judah when the latter fell to the
    Babylonians. (See Eze. 35:1-15; 36:5.)

      How can the sins of Israel's enemies, gloating, contempt, and re-
    venge, be eradicated from the lives of Christians? (See the comment on
    Matthew 5:22 in Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pp. 55-58.)

    I11. TYRE AND PROPHECY (Ezekiel 26, 27).

    6. Why did the destruction of Jerusalem cause rejoicing in Tyre?
       Eze. 26:1, 2 (compare Neh. 13:16).



       "Tyre's joy at Jerusalem's downfall seems to have been purely selfish. In
    the days of Solomon, Jerusalem had been a great inland commercial center
    through which flowed trade from Arabia and even from India. Jerusalem
    had doubtless been enriched by trade with the Phoenicians. Even in her
    decline, because of the importance of her situation, Jerusalem had no doubt
    been the center of many commercial transactions that Tyre would have been
    happy to monopolize."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 667.

    7. How does Ezekiel describe the people of Tyre? Eze. 27:3-9. What
                                                                                65
 Lesson 9                                                        June 1
     would happen to them? Eze. 27:26, 27. Who would bewail their
     fate? Eze. 27:28-36.



   "The Tyrian rulers, being merchant princes, were not interested in war-
fare (Is 23:8); they traded with all countries around the Mediterranean Sea,
and later in lands beyond that sea. Their main products were purple dyes,
glassware, and metal objects, but they also traded in slaves (Eze 27:13;
Amos 1:9; Joel 3:5, 6)—among them Hebrews—and products of other
countries."—SDA Bible Dictionary, "Tyre."
   The Phoenicians were great colonizers, as well as traders. Their two
most important colonies were Carthage in North Africa and Tarshish
(probably Tartessus) in southern Spain.

8. What judgment was pronounced against the Phoenicians? Eze.
   26:3-6. Who would bring about this destruction? Eze. 26:7-14, 21
   (compare 29:17-20).



   Tyre had two sites. Old Tyre, which the Greeks called Palaityros, was
built on the mainland. New Tyre was built on a 140-acre rock island that
lay about half a mile off the coast. The inhabitants of mainland Tyre would
flee to island Tyre in time of war. Eventually they made the island a per-
manent city.
   Nebuchadnezzar successfully conquered and destroyed Palaityros, the
city on the mainland. Yet, because the people fled to the island city, Nebu-
chadnezzar had nothing to plunder. (See Eze. 29:17, 18.) He laid siege to
the island city for 13 years, but was never able to overthrow it. Finally, he
agreed to allow Tyre to continue its kingship with a semi-independent sta-
tus. Tyre agreed to the presence of a Babylonian commissioner to oversee
the regular payment of tribute to the Babylonian empire.

   Alexander the Great in 332 B.C. completed the destruction of Tyre
that Nebuchadnezzar had begun. After building a causeway from the main-
land to the island with debris from Old Tyre, he captured the stronghold by
attacking it simultaneously by land and by sea.

   Old Tyre never rebuilt. God said that Tyre would never be rebuilt
(Eze. 26:14). But the Tyrians eventually recovered. A city existed in Jesus'
day (Matt. 15:21-28), and a Christian church flourished there in apostolic
times (Acts 21:3-6). There also is a community presently situated partly on
the island and partly on Alexander's causeway. How are we then to under-
stand the prophecy?
   It should be noted that Palaityros, Old Tyre, has never been rebuilt. The
desolation is so complete that its site cannot be positively identified. (See
Eze. 26:21.) The Lord was speaking about the glory and might of the an-
cient city state. As God predicted, this great commercial power has forever
perished.

         Selfish commercialism evidently destroyed the relationship between
      Tyre and Jerusalem. Why does "the love of money" draw out our
      worst characteristics? Why are we seldom happy with the financial
      success of others?

WED   IV. THE POWER BEHIND THE THRONE (Ezekiel 28).

      9.    What insufferable attitude did the prince of Tyre display? Eze.
            28:2. What talents contributed to Tyre's arrogance? Eze. 28:3-5.



        The Lord signally blessed Daniel at the court of Babylon. He was
      widely known for his fidelity to God and for his profound wisdom. God's
      bestowal of wisdom and ability upon Daniel prompted in him a spirit of
      humility. Similar gifts enabled the people of Tyre to amass great wealth,
      which only served to foster in them a proud spirit.

      10. How would God permit the people of Tyre to be humbled? Eze.
          28:6-10 (compare 26:7).



         "There is nothing so offensive to God or so dangerous to the human
      soul as pride and self-sufficiency. Of all sins it is the most hopeless, the
      most incurable."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 154.
         "It was the pride and ambition cherished in the heart of Satan that
      banished him from heaven. These evils are deeply rooted in our fallen na-
      ture, and if not removed they will overshadow every good and noble qual-
      ity and bring forth envy and strife as their baleful fruits.
         "We should seek for true goodness rather than greatness. Those who
      possess the mind of Christ will have humble views of themselves. They
      will labor for the purity and prosperity of the church, and be ready to sacri-
      fice their own interests and desires rather than to cause dissension among
      their brethren."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 242.

      11. Whose characteristics did the prince of Tyre accurately reflect?
          Eze. 28:11-19.



         The moral controversy between God, the Creator, and Satan, formerly
      one of His highest creatures, who is in rebellion against Him, is a present
      reality on this sin-cursed planet. In the same way that God was the King
      over the ruler of Israel, Satan was the real king over the pagan nations who
      opposed the true God. The proud prince of Tyre so matched the charac-
      teristics of Satan that prophetic inspiration permits us a glimpse of the de-
      monic personality who ruled through him.
         The relationship between the king of Tyre and Lucifer (Satan) is em-
      phasized in the following expressions: (1) "Thou hast been in Eden the gar-
      den of God" (verse 13); (2) "Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth;

     . . . thou wast upon the holy mountain of God" (verse 14); (3) "Thou wast
     perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was
     found in thee" (verse 15); (4) "I will cast thee as profane out of the moun-
     tain of God: and I will destroy thee, 0 covering cherub" (verse 16).

     12. What was Lucifer's character when created by God? Eze. 28:15.
i        What was his position among the angels? Eze. 28:14; compare
         Ex. 25:18-22. What contributed to his pride and rebellion? Eze.
         28:12, 13, 17 (compare Isa. 14:12-14).



        "The law of love being the foundation of the government of God, the
     happiness of all created beings depended upon their perfect accord with its
     great principles of righteousness. God desires from all His creatures the
     service of love—homage that springs from an intelligent appreciation of
     His character. He takes no pleasure in a forced allegiance, and to all He
     grants freedom of will, that they may render Him voluntary service.
        "But there was one that chose to pervert this freedom. Sin originated
     with him who, next to Christ, had been most honored of God and who
     stood highest in power and glory among the inhabitants of heaven. Before
     his fall, Lucifer was first of the covering cherubs, holy and undefiled."—

        "God made him good and beautiful, as near as possible like Him-
     self."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4,
     p. 1163.

     13. Since the fall of Adam and Eve, what position does Satan hold?
         2 Cor. 4:4 (compare John 12:31; 14:30). What powers in the
         earth does he control unless God intervenes? Luke 4:5, 6 (com-
         pare Ps. 50:12).



        What understanding of the controversy between God and Satan
     enables Christians to treat even their opponents with compassion and
     forgiveness? (See Eph. 6:12; Matt. 5:44-48.)

     V. THE BROKEN REED (Ezekiel 29, 30).

        The prophecies against Egypt all begin with the phrase, "The word of
     the Lord came unto me, saying." The seven statements fill four chapters—
     Ezekiel 29-32.

     14. With whom did Zedekiah ally Judah? Eze. 17:15. To what extent
         did this help Judah? Jer. 37:5-11.



la 15. With what graphic language did Ezekiel predict the Lord's judg-
          ment on Egypt? Eze. 29:1-7. How long would Egypt be scattered
     68
  Lord of the Nations                                             June 1
    before it would be restored as a minor power? Eze. 29:12-20;
    30:20-26.



   The term translated "dragon" (Eze. 29:3) is thought to refer to the
crocodile, an animal common to the Nile in ancient times. Although a
broken cuneiform tablet refers to a campaign by Nebuchadnezzar against
Egypt in his thirty-seventh year, we presently have no data on such an ex-
tensive destruction as Ezekiel described.
   The several prophecies against Egypt were given in order to impress the
Jews that only the Creator God could be their true ally. Judah's hope lay in
true repentance and a true, wholehearted dependence on her real King, the
God of heaven.

WHAT ARE THE LESSONS FOR MODERN CHRISTIANS?
   • What do the issues of the great controversy pointed out in Ezekiel 28
mean to me? What does this passage indicate regarding the character of
God and the character of Satan?
   • What lesson can the church today learn from Judah's attempt to
make a workable alliance with Egypt?
   • Why are feuds between relatives often bitter? What can the Christian
do to prevent or to relieve such conflicts?
   • Why does the church encourage its members to be good citizens in
any government under which they live? (See Matt. 22:21; Rom. 13:1-7;
1 Peter 2:13-17.) What limitations are there to this counsel? (See Acts
5:29.)

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read "The Origin of Evil"
in The Great Controversy, pp. 492-504.

SUMMARY: The God of the Scriptures is the Lord of the nations.
Through His church He purposes to impart to all peoples a knowledge of
His saving grace. God rules in the earth and holds the nations accountable
for their attitudes toward and treatment of His people, as well as for the
just government of all their subjects.

   Shepherds, Sheep, and
         Salvation
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ezekiel 34.

SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture,
PM    are men, and I am your God, saith the Lord God" (Ezekiel
      34:31).

WHY DOES THE LORD USE THE ILLUSTRATION OF SHEEP
AND SHEPHERDS? What are the characteristics of sheep and shepherds
that make them such apt symbols of the message that the Lord wishes to
convey to His people?

OUTLINE:
   I. Self-caring Shepherds (Eze. 34:1-6).
  11. Accountable Shepherds (Eze. 34:7-10).
 I11. Restoration of the Scattered Flock (Eze. 34:11-16).
 IV. Promise of the Messianic Shepherd (Eze. 34:23-30).

A LOVING PARENT WITH A SHEPHERD'S HEART. In a tragic
divorce the court placed the two boys of the marriage, Craig (age 10) and
Brent (age 3), in custody of their mother, Laurie. Anticipating the court ac-
tion, her husband suddenly left both employment and home and disap-
peared with the boys. But the ties between mother and children are not
easily broken, and Laurie began a long, determined search to find her boys.
   All of the loving mother's earnest efforts to locate her children were un-
availing, until nine years after their disappearance an in-law relative inad-
vertently revealed the state to which the father had taken them. Laurie
found her children and began building a relationship with them. The older
boy was now married; the younger one, age 12, went to live with his
mother. For Laurie, the long search was over.
   Are pastors and local leaders in God's church as earnest as Laurie in
their search for the sheep that leave the fold? When "lost sheep" are lo-
cated, are leaders prepared to plead for grace to awaken and nurture the
"first love" that once caused them to rejoice in the Saviour? There is al-
ways a great need for leaders and members with "shepherd hearts" who
will draw back to Christ those who have wandered away.
   In Ezekiel's time God reproved the appointed undershepherds who ex-
ploited His people and who were in a large measure responsible for the
sins that led to their being scattered abroad. In our lesson this week we
learn how God promised to restore the exiled nation of Israel to its home-
land. Like a shepherd, He still promises to gather together the faithful, es-
tablishing them in His kingdom.

I. SELF-CARING SHEPHERDS (Eze. 34:1-6).

   The last 15 chapters of Ezekiel's prophecy are designed to inspire hope
in the nation's restoration from captivity.

1. Who were held accountable for Judah's moral decline leading to
   the captivity? Eze. 34:2. Who were included in this class of per-
   sons? Eze. 22:25-28 (compare Jer. 13:17-20).



   Throughout chapter 34, Ezekiel figuratively describes the nation as a
beautiful flock of sheep. Its shepherds were the political and religious
leaders—kings, princes, and priests. Prophets—true and false—also exer-
cised leadership roles. In the Christian church, who are the shepherds of
the flock?

2. How did Judah's shepherds treat the people in the times of Ezekiel
   and Jeremiah? Eze. 34:2-4; Jer. 23:1, 2. By what term did Jesus
   describe this kind of shepherd? John 10:12, 13.



   "The hireling reveals his identity by his attitude to the sheep.
Shepherding with him is just a job. But with a true shepherd it is a privi-
lege. The hireling is a shearer rather than a sharer. The flock to him is
something to be exploited, and wanderers are a nuisance."—R. A. Ander-
son, The Shepherd-Evangelist (Washington, D.C.: Review and Herald
Publishing Assn., 1950), p. 563.

3. What sad examples of shepherd exploitation of God's people does
   the Bible mention?

   Amos 8:4-7

   Mark 12:38-40

   Matt. 23:13

   "Christ unsparingly condemned abuses, but He was careful not to less-
en obligation. He rebuked the selfishness that extorted and misapplied the
widow's gifts. At the same time He commended the widow who brought
her offering for God's treasury. Man's abuse of the gift could not turn
God's blessing from the giver."—The Desire of Ages, p. 614.

4. How did Judah's shepherds treat the "diseased" and "sick"
   members of the Lord's flock, and with what result? Eze. 34:4, 5.
   What classes of persons make up the "diseased," "sick," and
   "driven away" in the church today? How would Christ have us
   relate to these? Matt. 9:36; 25:33-40; James 1:27.

                                                                        71
 Lesson 10                                                          June 8
   Ezekiel's sad portrayal depicts God's undershepherds as people ruling
"with force and with cruelty," exploiting the flock for personal ends, and
neglecting the needy. They caused the nation to be "scattered" throughout
the Babylonian empire and left individual Jews open to seduction and
abuse by pagan forces and influences. The implication is that consecrated
shepherds might have prevented this.

   The need for caring shepherds. "These are fast-moving days. Every-
thing is measured by speed. And if someone trips and falls, before help can
come-he is trampled under foot by the surging crowd. . . . These conditions
call for shepherds . . . who are not too busy to spend time untangling in-
dividual and community problems. Everywhere there are broken homes
and broken hearts, and these call for a shepherd's care. The world does not
lack luxuries, but it does lack love. . . . Of all the titles given to our Lord,
none is more beautiful than 'the Good Shepherd.' He never spoke of Him-
self as a bishop or a priest, an executive or a preacher, but always as a
shepherd."—R. A. Anderson, The Shepherd-Evangelist, pp. 550, 551.

5. One failure stands out against Judah's shepherds: "Neither have
   ye sought that which was lost" (Eze. 34:4). How did Jesus il-
   lustrate the value of one lost person in God's sight? Luke 15:3-7.



   "At last his [the shepherd's] effort is rewarded; the lost is found. Then
he does not scold it because it has caused him so much trouble. He does
not drive it with a whip. He does not even try to lead it home. In his joy he
takes the trembling creature upon his shoulders; if it is bruised and
wounded, he gathers it in his arms, pressing it close to his bosom, that the
warmth of his own heart may give it life. With gratitude that his search has
not been in vain, he bears it back to the fold."—Christ' s Object Lessons,
p. 188.

   We rejoice in the baptism of new believers and their acceptance of
church membership. In what practical ways can members or church
officers, individually or as a Sabbath School class, reach out to find
any who have wandered from the congregation?

   "How many of the wandering ones have you, reader, sought for and
brought back to the fold? When you turn from those who seem unpromis-
ing and unattractive, do you realize that you are neglecting the souls for
whom Christ is seeking? At the very time when you turn from them, they
may be in the greatest need of your compassion."—Christ's Object Les-
sons, p. 191.

H. ACCOUNTABLE SHEPHERDS (Eze. 34:7-10).

6. Although appointed to the care of God's people, what major task
   did Judah's shepherds fail to perform? Eze. 34:8. Compare this
   failure with Christ's commission to Peter and with Peter's instruc-
   tion to later church leaders. John 21:15-17; 1 Peter 5:2.
72
      Shepherds, Sheep, and Salvation                                 June 8
    7. How does "feeding" the flock prevent "wolves" from destroying
       the sheep? Note how the "wolves" function. Acts 20:28-31 (com-
       pare Col. 2:6-8; Eph. 4:14).



       Church members with an intelligent understanding of the Bible's teach-
    ings, in union with Jesus Christ, and witnessing of His grace to others, sel-
    dom fall prey to the "wolves" of false teachings. Those who do not
    thoroughly understand the reasons for their faith and whose commitment to
    Christ is weak are open to deception. (See 2 Peter 2:1-3.)

       Preach Christ. "There is today in nearly all Christian churches an
    alarming trend away from specific doctrines. Ethical sermons, social and
    even political sermons, or sermons on current events are common, but ser-
    mons on the great fundamentals of gospel truth are seldom heard. We do
    not advocate speculative, theorizing sermons on old fossilized creeds or
    theological sophistries, but true doctrinal preaching that elevates Christ
    and leads to repentance and faith, is urgently needed."—Lewis H. Chris-
    tian, Modern Religious Trends (Washington, D.C.: Review and Herald
    Publishing Assn., 1941), pp. 146, 147.

    8. Why is it a serious matter for the believer to take up the work of
       shepherding in the Lord's flock? Eze. 34:10 (compare Heb. 13:17).



      We cannot escape the responsibility to serve the Lord's flock if He has
    endowed us with the talent. We are to sense the awesomeness of our task
    and seek the Lord's wisdom to work according to His will.

NI 9. In describing His own shepherding, what characteristics of a
       responsible shepherd leader does Jesus mention? John 10:11, 14.



       A "good shepherd" is selfless. Like the apostle Paul, such a shepherd
    "will very gladly spend and be spent" (2 Cor. 12:15). He gives his life for
    those persons coming under his care. He has the "mind" of Christ (Phil.
    2:5), which prompts him to seek the best good for them even at his own
    expense. Another requirement in a "good shepherd" is willingness to
    come close to people—to know and care for them as individuals.

        Jesus cares for individuals. "Jesus knows us individually, and is
    touched with the feeling of our infirmities. He knows us all by name. He
    knows the very house in which we live, the name of each occupant. He has
    at times given directions to His servants to go to a certain street in a cer-
    tain city, to such a house, to find one of His sheep.
        "Every soul is as fully known to Jesus as if he were the only one for
    whom the Saviour died. The distress of every one touches His heart. The
    cry for aid reaches His ear. . . .
                                                                               73
       Lesson 10                                                         June 8
         "Reader, He loves you. Heaven itself can bestow nothing greater, noth-
      ing better. Therefore trust."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 479-483.

         Every believer has "a flock"—persons for whom he or she may have
      a particular responsibility. Parents are accountable for their children; teach-
      ers for their students; the Sabbath School teacher for his or her class; the
      local elder for the church; the pastor for his district; believers for their
      neighbors.
         "To every soul a trust is given. Of everyone the Chief Shepherd will
      demand, 'Where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock?'
      And 'what wilt thou say when He shall punish thee?' Jer. 13:20, 21."—
      The Desire of Ages, p. 641.

         Often new converts to the Adventist Church lose their former ties
      with family and friends. What can I and my Sabbath School class do
      to integrate new members into our church fellowship? How can we as-
      sist them in establishing permanent roots?

WED   I11. RESTORATION OF THE SCATTERED FLOCK (Eze. 34:11-
           16).

      10. Still using the figure of the flock, what does God now promise His
          people? Eze. 34:11-16. What is the evidence that the nation had
          long been acquainted with this tender portrayal of God? Ps. 23:1-
          6; 80:1.



         Because divine justice is manifested at times in the Old Testament,
      some think of the God of Israel as a God of sternness and wrath, and of the
      God of the New Testament as a God of love. This superficial observation
      misjudges the Lord's true character. Divine love and justice are two sides
      of the same coin. The Old Testament's description of God as the great
      Shepherd emphasizes all the tender, loving qualities that we see shining
      forth in Jesus.

      11. To whom did God refer as "my shepherd" and appoint by name
          a century and a half before his birth to restore the Israelites to
          Palestine after the Babylonian captivity? Isa. 44:28.



         A century and a half before Ezekiel's day, God predicted the fall of the
      Neo-Babylonian Empire to the Medes and Persians (Isa. 45:1-5). "The ad-
      vent of the army of Cyrus before the walls of Babylon was to the Jews a
      sign that their deliverance from captivity was drawing nigh."—Prophets
      and Kings, p. 551. After his capture of Babylon (539 B.C.), Cyrus passed
      a decree for the return of the Jews to their own land. (See Ezra 1:1-4.)
         "As the king saw the words foretelling, more than a hundred years
      before his birth, the manner in which Babylon should be taken . . . his heart
      was profoundly moved, and he determined to fulfill his divinely appointed
      74
        Shepherds, Sheep, and Salvation                                 June 8
      mission. He would let the Judean captives go free; he would help them re-
      store the temple of Jehovah."—Prophets and Kings, pp. 557, 558.

      12. Of whom were Cyrus and his army a type? What final great
          gathering of God's people was foreshadowed by the restoration of
          the Jews from captivity? Rev. 16:12; 19:9.



         It is sometimes difficult for a backslider to be restored to active fel-
      lowship in the church. There is often embarrassment or concern as to
      what members might think and say. What can I do to relieve this feel-
      ing and to bring a warm assurance of acceptance to such persons?

      IV. PROMISE OF THE MESSIANIC SHEPHERD (Eze. 34:23-30).
111
      13. How is the coming Messiah, the Son of David, portrayed in the
          prophecy? Eze. 34:23, 24 (compare parallel prophecies in Jer.
          23:5, 6; Isa. 40:10, 11; Dan. 9:24, 25).



         The Shepherd whom God promises to place over His people in the fu-
      ture is not to be a resurrected David, but the Messiah Himself, the Son of
      David. To call Him David is simply a Hebraic manner of speaking. Even-
      tually he would take the throne of David (Eze. 21:26, 27; Jer. 23:5; Luke
      1:32, 33).

      14. How did Jesus affirm that He was the fulfillment of this
          prophecy? John 10:1-6, 11-18, 26-29.



         Christ's gracious ministry to all classes and conditions of people is a
      model for His undershepherds: "Jesus did not suppress one word of truth,
      but He uttered it always in love. He exercised the greatest tact and thought-
      ful, kind attention in His intercourse with the people. He was never rude,
      never needlessly spoke a severe word, never gave needless pain to a sensi-
      tive soul. He did not censure human weakness. He spoke the truth, but al-
      ways in love. He denounced hypocrisy, unbelief, and iniquity; but tears
      were in His voice as He uttered His scathing rebukes. . . . His life was one
      of self-denial and thoughtful care for others."—Steps to Christ, p. 12.

      15. What blessings will attend the Lord's people in the future Mes-
          sianic age? Eze. 34:25-30.



         These promised blessings were to result from Israel's covenant relation-
      ship with God. They envisioned the glorious fruition of their national ex-
      istence: the coming of the Messiah to the world. (See Gen. 22:18; Isa.
                                                                               75
 Lesson 10                                                                 June 8
49:9-11.) God was seeking to prepare Israel for what could have been her
finest hour. But because the leaders rejected Christ (John 19:15) these
prophecies will be fulfilled in principle for spiritual Israel (the redeemed of
all ages) in the new earth. (See Rev. 21:3, 4.)

SEEKING THE LOST:
   • Jesus knows His sheep and meets their need. How can I know the
needs of the people in my church so that I can minister to them?
   • Why do I tend to withdraw my love and interest from someone who
backslides in his religious experience?
   • Who needs more of the compassion and active concern of the church:
the drifting, compromising member, or the member who attends regularly?
What can I and my fellow members do about the apostasy rate in our con-
gregation?

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read "The Return of the
Exiles," Prophets and Kings, pp. 551-566.

SUMMARY: God views His people as a flock of sheep, beautiful and use-
ful in His service, but vulnerable to the enemy unless totally dependent
upon Him. God's undershepherds, all who have a part in leading His
people, are commissioned to nurture the flock and recover the lost. And
"when the chief Shepherd shall appear," such faithful shepherds will "re-
ceive a crown of glory that fadeth not away" (1 Peter 5:4).

THE NEW BIRTH AND SELF-DISCIPLINE. How essential to Chris-
tian life is a new-heart (new-birth) experience? Why cannot the needed
changes in attitudes and behavior be brought about by self-discipline?

LOVE CHANGES HEARTS. Evangeline Booth, an officer in the Salva-
tion Army and the daughter of its founder, stood with a few others at the
entrance of a local police court and temporary prison, waiting for the gates
to open.
   Abruptly their attention was attracted by the sound of shuffling feet,
loud commands, and the shrill voice of a woman on the other side of the
enclosure. The iron gates opened as six policemen wrestled a struggling
woman through the passageway toward a waiting vehicle.
   The woman's hair was disheveled and matted. Her face was blackened
with bruises; clots of dried blood marked her left temple. Her clothes and
apron were bloodstained and torn. Cursing and swearing, she tossed her
head wildly as she fought with the guards.
    With deep compassion, Miss Booth wondered what she could do. There
was no opportunity to speak with the prisoner. Nor did prayer, song,
money, or counsel seem appropriate. As the woman, struggling with the
officers, approached, Miss Booth, on impulse, stepped forward and kissed
her on the cheek.
    Wrenching herself free, the woman clasped her hands and cried to the
gray skies, "Who kissed me? Who kissed me? Nobody has kissed me
since my mother died!" The fight drained out of her; she lifted the tattered
apron, buried her face in its folds, and wept convulsively. Docile and
 broken, the woman was led away by the police.
                                                                         77

   A few days later Miss Booth visited the woman's prison cell. She found
her subdued but still asking, "Who kissed me?" The warden thought her
insane, but with Miss Booth she was friendly and receptive, especially so
when she told her that it was she who had kissed her.
   Then Miss Booth spoke of the Saviour, how He went to the cross to
bear our sins and was wounded for our transgressions that He might put the
kiss of pardon upon our cheeks. She lovingly led a sin-enslaved soul into
the freedom of salvation in Jesus Christ. (Adapted. Evangeline Booth,
"Who Kissed Me?" Life and Health, January 1969, p. 17.)
   In this week's lesson we see God's design that the return to Palestine
should be through the experience of conversion. The new life of Israel after
the exile must begin with the individual heart.
   Our hope of eternal life in the heavenly Canaan can never be realized
without the fundamental transformation referred to in the New Testament
as the "new birth." The "kiss" of God's grace brings the change.

I. THE GIFT OF THE LAND (Eze. 11:17).

1. What material gift would God give the restored nation? Eze.
   11:17. In what sense was this gift given, when apparently it al-
   ready belonged to Israel? (Compare Lev. 25:23; 2 Chron. 7:19, 20;
   Hosea 9:3.)



   Canaan never really belonged to Israel. It was the Lord's land. The
Israelites possessed it as His stewards on the basis of their covenant rela-
tionship with the true Owner. When the people broke their covenant with
God, they forfeited all right to His blessings, of which the land was one.
Now in connection with the anticipated renewal of the covenant (Jer.
31:31-34), God again promised them the land.

2. What promises were made in connection with the land? Eze. 36:8-
   11, 29, 30, 34-38. What special lesson were the Israelites to learn?
   Note the last part of verses 11 and 38 (compare Deut. 8:17, 18).



    The Creator intended that material prosperity should lead its recipients
to render Him grateful praise and so to strengthen the bond between Him-
self and His children. (See Ps. 116:12-14.) But how often we rejoice in the
gift and forget the Giver.
    Sometimes we make the mistake of imagining that we are materially
prosperous because of our spiritual superiority. Despite his spirituality, Job
suffered intensely; despite Israel's prosperity, the people lacked spiritual-
ity.

3. Ancient Israel was given the land of Canaan in trust. The Lord
   was concerned for their happiness and also for their influence on
   other nations. What has God entrusted to the entire human fami-
   ly? Ps. 24:1; 115:16 (compare Gen. 1:26, 28).
78
       Heaven's Heart Surgery                                          June 15
         Sin has greatly thwarted God's purpose. By sin, Adam and Eve for-
      feited the stewardship privilege that God had entrusted to them. Had it not
      been for the plan of salvation, the race would have perished. Greed, avar-
      ice, and oppression have created sad inequities between rich and poor.
      Mankind has often treated his physical environment with selfish indiffer-
      ence. In a real sense, all our material blessings are possible because of the
      cross of Christ.

         "To the death of Christ we owe even this earthly life. The bread we
      eat is the purchase of His broken body. The water we drink is bought by
      His spilled blood. Never one, saint or sinner, eats his daily food, but he is
      nourished by the body and the blood of Christ. The cross of Calvary is
      stamped on every loaf. It is reflected in every water spring. . . . The family
      board becomes as the table of the Lord, and every meal a sacrament"—
      The Desire of Ages, p. 660.

         How has your material prosperity (or lack of it) affected your rela-
      tionship with God? How has it affected your relationship with other
      people? (Read the story of the prodigal son in Christ's Object Lessons,
      especially pp. 200, 201.)

MON   11. THE GIFT OF A NEW HEART (Eze. 11:19).

         Spiritual revival was the most important feature of the restoration. The
      suffering of the captivity awakened in honest hearts the need for repen-
      tance. Through adversity they discovered the loving concern of God.

      4. How did Jeremiah express the call for spiritual renewal? Jer.
         29:10-14.



         As Jeremiah and Ezekiel summoned Israel to spiritual preparation for
      their return home, a similar appeal sounds out to the church today: "A
      revival of true godliness among us is the greatest and most urgent of all our
      needs. To seek this should be our first work. . . . But it is our work, by con-
      fession, humiliation, repentance, and earnest prayer, to fulfill the conditions
      upon which God has promised to grant us His blessing. A revival need be
      expected only in answer to prayer."—Selected Messages, book 1, p. 121.

      5. While Jeremiah called on the people to seek the Lord "with all
         your heart," what did God promise He would give such persons?
         Eze. 11:19; 36:25, 26, 33. What three things were promised that
         only divine grace can accomplish?



         The promise of spiritual change applied to Israel as a nation. But the re-
      storation of the nation could be accomplished only as transformation was
      realized in individual lives. David and the apostle Paul described this ex-
      perience as a "new creation." (See Ps. 51:10; 2 Cor. 5:17.)
                                                                                  79
 Lesson 11                                                      June 15
6. How did Jesus refer to this same miraculous transformation? How
   essential did He declare it to be? By whose agency did He indicate
   it would be accomplished? John 3:3-7.



   "It is impossible for us, of ourselves, to escape from the pit of sin in
which we are sunken. Our hearts are evil, and we cannot change them.
`Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one. ' `The carnal
mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither
indeed can be.' Job 14:4; Romans 8:7. . . . There must be a power working
from within, a new life from above, before men can be changed from sin
to holiness. That power is Christ. His grace alone can quicken the lifeless
faculties of the soul, and attract it to God, to holiness."—Steps to Christ,
p. 18.

   Have I been born again? What is the evidence of a new heart, the
new-birth experience? Should rapturous feelings mark my conver-
sion?

I11. THE RESPONSE OF OBEDIENCE (Eze. 11:20).

7.    What further work of grace did God promise in connection with
      His gift of "a new heart"? Eze. 11:20; 36:27.



    Parents must provide rules for children in order to prepare them for
successful adulthood. The objective is that the child will internalize paren-
tal guidelines so that the compelling impulse to live a useful life will come
from within.
    God's promise to Israel and to us is that all penitent sinners may have
the presence of His Spirit in their hearts, enabling them "to walk in my
statutes" and to "keep my judgments, and do them" (Eze. 36:27).

8. According to Jesus and the apostle Paul, what is the motivation for
   cheerful obedience to God's will? Matt. 22:36-40; Rom. 13:8-10.
   How is this "motivation" obtained? Eze. 36:27; Rom. 5:5.



   By nature every human being is self-centered and opposed to God's
lordship (Rom. 8:6-8). There is no possible way for the natural heart to
render genuine obedience to God. The Holy Spirit, the great life-changer,
can alter this situation. He brings about the "new birth" (John 3:5-8),
creates a new heart (Ps. 51:10, 11), animates it with love for God and man
(Rom. 5:5), and inscribes within it the precepts of the Father's will (Jer.
31:33). This enables the transformed sinner to live in joyful harmony with
Him (Eze. 36:27).

     The service of love. — But notice here that obedience is not a mere out-
80
        Heaven's Heart Surgery                                         June 15
      ward compliance, but the service of love. . . . If our hearts are renewed in
      the likeness of God, if divine love is implanted in the soul, will not the law
      of God be carried out in the life? When the principle of love is implanted
      in the heart, when man is renewed after the image of Him that created him,
      the new covenant promise is fulfilled, 'I will put my laws into their hearts,
      and in their minds will I write them.'. . . Instead of releasing man from
      obedience, it is faith, and faith only, that makes us partakers of the grace
      of Christ, which enables us to render obedience."—Steps to Christ, pp. 60,
      61.

         Some argue that Christians living under the greater light of the
      cross no longer need the Ten Commandments. They hold that Chris-
      tians should simply do the loving thing in every situation. What is
      wrong with this line of reasoning?
WED   IV. HONORING GOD (Eze. 36:16-24).

       9. God reminds Israel that it was her deep apostasy that caused her
          captivity. What effect did this collapse have on the peoples of the
          surrounding nations? Eze. 36:16-20.



         Planted where she had access to the nations of three continents, it had
      been Israel's responsibility and privilege to extend the knowledge of the
      true God. (See Isa. 56:6, 7.) Israel's subjugation by the Babylonians led
      these same nations to regard the God of Israel as impotent—unable or un-
      willing to protect His people. Israel's apostasy caused the pagan nations to
      profane the one true God. They turned away from the Creator and Saviour
      of humanity. (See Isa. 45:22.)

      10. For what major reason did God overrule events so as to bring
          about the restoration of His people? Eze. 36:21-24.



         The Lord is not saying that He did not love His people. The fact is, He
      regarded the returned exiles as "the apple of his eye" (Zech. 2:8). He
      wanted Israel to understand that their restoration was not due to merit on
      their part. Nor was the Lord selfishly seeking His own honor. Love for
      God is based on respect for His holiness. Vindication of His name before
      the nations was the first step in leading them to accept salvation through
      the coming Messiah.

      11. What should always be the believer's aim in life? 1 Cor. 10:31
          (compare John 17:4).



         When by our words and deeds we bring honor to God, we attract others
      to Him. When we live like worldlings, we dishonor God and hinder un-
                                                                                  81
  Lesson 11                                                     June 15
believers from accepting His grace. They reason, "Why should we be
Christians? They are no better than we are."

12. What is the first petition in Christ's model prayer? Why does He
    make this matter so prominent? Matt. 6:9.



  God's name stands for His person, or character. It is always the prayer
and aim of the true believer to exalt God's character before people so that
He might draw them to salvation. (See Isa. 45:22; John 12:32.)

   "This petition calls upon you to possess His character. You cannot
hallow His name, you cannot represent Him to the world, unless in life and
character you represent the very life and character of God. This you can do
only through the acceptance of the grace and righteousness of Christ"—
Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 107.

   Why is it essential to the plan of salvation for God to clear and
honor His name? (See Rev. 15:3, 4; Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 68,
69.)

V. THE MINISTRY OF REPENTANCE (Eze. 36:31, 32).

13. What did the Lord predict would be the response of His people to
    the experience of the captivity? Eze. 36:31, 32 (compare Eze.
    20:43; 6:9).



    It seems that the captivity was the only way God could bring His people
to individual and corporate repentance. Did they have to go through this?
Was there any other way?
    "Self-loathing is a mark of godly sorrow, which, if permitted to have its
perfect work, leads to repentance (2 Cor. 7:10). . . . True sorrow is thus
produced: . . . When in this state the sinner casts his helpless soul upon
Jesus and trusts wholly in the divine merits, his repentance is accepted."—
SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, pp. 596, 597.

14. Why is repentance basic to a genuine conversion? Note the
    Lord's repeated calls for it. Eze. 14:6; 18:30. What is involved in
    repentance? Eze. 33:11.



    As the Lord's Spirit moves upon human hearts they are led to respond
in faith, repentance (Acts 20:21), and obedience (John 14:15). Sorrow for
sin is always involved in genuine repentance, but there is more to it than
that. The concept means "to turn" or "to turn around." True repentance
means a total change in the direction of the life, a fundamental change in
attitude toward God and man.
82
       Heaven's Heart Surgery                                          June 15
        Only the operation of the Holy Spirit can bring conviction of sin. The
     Spirit impresses us with God's love and our own sinfulness. Repentance is
     as much a gift from God as is forgiveness. (See Rom. 2:4.)

       What does Ellen White mean when she writes of religious ex-
     perience as follows? "At every advance step in our Christian ex-
     perience, our repentance will deepen."—The Acts of the Apostles, p.
     561.

     AM I FOLLOWING THE LORD'S COUNSEL TO ISRAEL?
        • If I see my religion as simply a list of do's and don'ts, what is
     wrong? How can I rejoice in my faith without turning it into license?
        • Why may a believer not be able to mark the moment of conversion?
     Does this mean that a person does not need to make an intelligent decision
     to be a follower of Jesus Christ? (See Matt. 16:24-26.)
        • What do you think is meant by the following statement? "Genuine
     sanctification . . . is nothing less than a daily dying to self and daily con-
     formity to the will of God."—Life Sketches, p. 237.


si   FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read the chapter entitled
     "Repentance," in Steps to Christ, pp. 23-36.

     SUMMARY: Israel's future restoration from Babylonian captivity and the
     approaching advent of the Messiah pointed the exiles forward to what
     should have been the nation's finest hour. The spiritual preparation for
     these events, involving the renewal of the covenant with God, required a
     genuine change of heart and lifestyle. Divine grace awaits our demand. It
     is the all-sufficient means of spiritual transformation for those willing to be
     totally surrendered to Christ.

        The Valley of Bones
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ezekiel 37.

SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, 0 my
 PM
      people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of
      your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel" (Ezekiel
      37:12).

HOW ARE THE SPIRITUALLY DEAD MADE ALIVE? Why does
the Bible describe unconverted and backslidden persons as "dead"? What
powerful forces are available to resurrect both the spiritually and the physi-
cally dead?

OUTLINE:
   I. National Revival Promised (Eze. 37:1-14).
  11. Spiritual Revival (Eph. 2:1-5).
 I11. Two Become One (Eze. 37:15-23).
 IV. Messianic Promises Repeated (Eze. 37:24-28).

ALIVE FROM THE DEAD. Al joined an Adventist church after attend-
ing an evangelistic series presented in a local hall. The family sat spell-
bound night after night, amazed to see how text linked to text could display
such graphic pictures of Bible truth! They gladly accepted Christ's call to
discipleship and were baptized.
    Energized by his new love for Jesus, Al readily accepted any responsi-
bility, large or small, in the congregation where his family fellowshiped.
Soon the church invited Al to be Sabbath School superintendent. The re-
ligious educational program challenged Al, and he did his best. Not being
aware of some procedures and policies, he made mistakes. A few members
began to criticize; instead of counseling, they condemned.
    When the criticism reached Al, he was hurt. Deeply discouraged, he
slipped back into a drinking habit. He resigned his office and soon stopped
attending church. Eventually, the family moved away. With disappoint-
ment the church dropped their names from the membership list. The years
passed. The family's spiritual life became extinct.
    One day a handbill advertising evangelistic meetings arrived in the
mail. A desire was awakened to attend, and Al, his wife, and daughter
heard again the thrilling truths of the three angels' messages. The Spirit
brought conviction, and the family decided once more for Christ. Their
new church family took them to their hearts and nurtured these spiritual
children of faith. Al and his wife remain faithful members of the church.

Adventist Review, October 22, 1987, p. 17.)

       The Valley of Bones                                            June 22
        Like Al and his wife, the nation of Israel had died spiritually. Apos-
     tasy led to terrible consequences. With the Babylonian conquest and the
     deportation that followed, Israel's national existence ceased. As God can
     resurrect the physically dead, so also Israel's national and spiritual exist-
     ence could be revived by the divine Lifegiver. This is the subject of our
     lesson this week.

     I. NATIONAL REVIVAL PROMISED (Eze. 37:1-14).


ii   1. How did God describe in vision the way the Israelite captives now
        thought about their nation? Eze. 37:1, 2. What idea is conveyed by
        the phrase "very dry"? What question did God ask Ezekiel? Eze.
        37:3.



        Scholars date Ezekiel's vision of the valley of bones to about 585 B.C.
     This indicates that the large body of captives brought to Babylon with king
     Jehoiachin (Eze. 1:2) had been in exile for more than a decade. Daniel and
     other royal hostages who preceded them had been at the Babylonian court
     20 years. All hope of a short exile had faded. In their despondency the
     Jews saw themselves like dead bones, bleached and white, scattered at the
     mouth of the grave, incapable of life.

     2. What happened in the prophet's vision when he began to
        prophesy, "0 ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord"? In what
        two stages did things change? Eze. 37:4-10 (compare Gen. 2:7).



        "What is the significance of the two stages? The difference between
     them is surely to be found in the direction of Ezekiel's prophesying; first
     to the bones, telling them to hear, and secondly to the spirit, invoking its
     inspiration. The first must have seemed to Ezekiel very much like his pro-
     fessional occupation, exhorting lifeless people to listen to God's word. The
     effect was limited: true, something remarkable happened, but the hearers
     were still dead men. The second action was tantamount to praying, as
     Ezekiel besought the Spirit of God to effect the miracle of re-creation, to
     breathe into man's nostrils the breath of life (compare Gen. 2:7). This time
     the effect was devastating. What preaching by itself failed to achieve,
     prayer made a reality."—John B. Taylor, Ezekiel (Downers Grove, Ill.:
     InterVarsity Press, 1969), p. 235.

     3. The Lord explains the parablelike vision. Whom did the bones
        represent? Who felt this way about the captivity? Eze. 37:11 (com-
        pare Jer. 7:32-8:3). What did the revival of this mass of bones
        represent? Eze. 37:12-14.



        The prophet saw a valley filled with dry human bones, scattered about
                                                                                85
Lesson 12                                                     June 22
on the surface of the ground. The captives were moaning, "Our bones are
dried, and our hope is lost." Because their national existence was dead,
they had no "government in exile." God spoke of them as being buried
out of sight in their graves. But the Lord sought to hush His people's wail-
ing and weeping with the remarkable promise to "resurrect" the nation
and to establish it once more in the land He had given them. The hope of
national "resurrection" was uplifted before them, a light illumining the
dark night of their exile. The time would come when the nation would be
"born" in a day. (See Isa. 66:8.)

4. How were the Israelites to conduct themselves during the years of
   their captivity? For what reasons? Jer. 29:4-7, 10. What were they to
   be prepared to do when the time for their release arrived? Jer. 50:8,
   9; 51:6, 11, 45 (compare Isa. 48:20).



5. In response to the gracious decree of the Persian king, Cyrus the
   Great (Ezra 1:2-4), how many Jews returned to their homeland?
   Ezra 2:64. Who also accompanied them? Ezra 2:65.



    In a remarkable manner God's Spirit moved on Cyrus to bring about the
resurrection of Israel as a nation. Cyrus' decree, published "throughout all
his kingdom" (Ezra 1:1), came like a reviving wind upon the exiles. The
entire nation could have risen like a mighty army from the grave of their
exile, marching in unison to their homeland, to taking their place among
the states of the Near East. Personal considerations limited the fulfillment
of the vision of dry bones. (See Prophets and Kings, p. 598.)
   The lack of response to the calls to return illustrate what could happen
within our own church when calls are made for revival and reformation. It
also illustrates the possible response to the call out of spiritual Babylon.
(See Rev. 18:1-4.)

6. Approximately two decades later what appeal did God again make
   to His people who remained in the territories of old Babylon, now
   under Persian rule? Zech. 2:6, 7.



   A little more than sixty years after God's appeal through the prophet
Zechariah, Ezra led another small contingent to the homeland (Ezra 8).
What could have been a glorious resurrection of a viable nation was
delimited by the exiles themselves to a mere remnant (Neh. 1:3). In the
long years of their exile, the majority of the Jewish captives had become
acclimated to their foreign environment and were satisfied to remain. They
shrank from the hardships involved in restoring Jerusalem and reviving
their national existence.

     In some areas our church tends to record fewer baptisms and
86
  The Valley of Bones                                             June 22
higher losses than in other areas. How may the material prosperity of
church members in these regions be dulling their interest in Christ's
return? How can these believers recapture the pioneer fervor?

11. SPIRITUAL REVIVAL (Eph. 2:1-5).

    Ezekiel's vision of the dry bones has specific application to our spiritual
life.

7. How does the apostle Paul describe the unregenerate sinner who
   lives apart from God? Eph. 2:1-5.



    "This biblical statement about the 'deadness' of non-Christian people
raises problems for many because it does not seem to square with the facts
of everyday experience. Lots of people who make no Christian profession
whatever, who even openly repudiate Jesus Christ, appear to be very much
alive. . . . Are we to say that such people, if Christ has not saved them, are
dead? Yes. . . . They are as unresponsive to him as a corpse. So we should
not hesitate to affirm that a life without God (however physically fit and
mentally alert the person may be) is a living death, and that those who live
it are dead even while they are living."—John R. W. Stott, God's New
Society (Downers Grove, Ill: InterVarsity Press, 1980), p. 72.

8. Jesus mingled among those whom the Pharisees viewed as
   spiritually "dead." See Luke 5:30-32. What effect did Jesus have
   on one whom His disciples would have regarded as dead to all
   things spiritual? Luke 23:39-43.



   "The souls of those whom we desire to save are like the representation
which Ezekiel saw in vision—a valley of dry bones. They are dead in tres-
passes and sins, but God would have us deal with them as though they
were living. . . . To all appearance there is nothing to lead us to hope for
their restoration. Yet nevertheless the word of the prophecy must be
spoken even to those who are like the dry bones in the valley.--Ellen G.
White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 1165.

9. In addition to unregenerate sinners, who else are sometimes
   viewed as "dead" to spiritual interests? Rev. 3:1 (compare 1 Tim.
   5:5, 6; Luke 15:24, 32).



   "There is nothing that Satan fears so much as that the people of God
shall clear the way by removing every hindrance, so that the Lord can pour
out His Spirit upon a languishing church and an impenitent congregation.
If Satan had his way, there would never be another awakening, great or
small, to the end of time. But we are not ignorant of his devices. It is
                                                                             87

possible to resist his power. When the way is prepared for the Spirit of
God, the blessing will come. Satan can no more hinder a shower of bless-
ing from descending upon God's people than he can close the windows of
heaven that rain cannot come upon the earth."—Selected Messages, book
1, p. 124.

   Many followers of Jesus plod on in spiritual indifference. What may
I do to prevent spiritual death from overtaking me and others?

I11. TWO BECOME ONE (Eze. 37:15-23).

10. What visual aid was Ezekiel to construct in the presence of the
    people to answer their questions about the future of the now
    defunct northern and southern kingdoms? Eze. 37:16, 17.



   The prophet simply held the end of one stick in his clenched hand. The
second stick was thrust into the same clenched fist, the two ends butting to-
gether. With his fingers over the joint, the sticks appeared as one to the
viewer.

11. What explanation was the prophet to make when the people
    asked the meaning of the acted prophecy? Eze. 37:18-23 (com-
    pare Hosea 1:11; Jer. 3:18; 50:4, 5).



   It was not unusual for the prophets to refer to the northern kingdom as
"Ephraim" (see Hosea 6:4) since it was the largest tribe west of the Jor-
dan and occupied the central area of the kingdom. "Ephraim" is also used
interchangeably with "Joseph." The tribe of Ephraim, along with its
brother tribe Manasseh, composed the tribe of Joseph.

   Tragedy resulted in reunion. It is sad to think that it took the tragedies
of the Assyrian and Babylonian captivities to bring about the reunion of
the Hebrew people. The division had lasted more than 200 years (from the
first year of Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, about 931 B.C., to the de-
struction of the northern kingdom, 722 B.C.). During those centuries the
brother nations often warred against each other. Now their mutual situation
as exiles enabled the Israelites to forgive and forget and to plan for a new
future together.
   Some descendants of all twelve tribes eventually returned to their
homeland after the Persian decrees gave them permission.

12. Unification of the two Jewish nations was both a challenge and a
    necessity. Why is unity even more essential for a world church
    preparing for Christ's second coming? Rev. 14:6 (compare Matt.
    28:18-20; John 17:20, 21).

      The Valley of Bones                                           June 22
        The membership of the Seventh-day Adventist Church represents about
     700 languages and 1,000 dialects with work established in varying degree
     in 190 countries. The cultural, political, social, and economic pressures on
     the unity of such a body are tremendous. The world body has adopted this
     statement on unity as part of our Fundamental Beliefs so that this impor-
     tant truth may be ever before the church:
        "The church is one body with many members, called from every na-
     tion, kindred, tongue, and people. In Christ we are a new creation; distinc-
     tions of race, culture, learning, and nationality, and differences between
     high and low, rich and poor, male and female, must not be divisive among
     us. We are all equal in Christ, who by one Spirit has bonded us into one
     fellowship with Him and with one another; we are to serve and be served
     without partiality or reservation. Through the revelation of Jesus Christ in
     the Scriptures we share the same faith and hope, and reach out in one wit-
     ness to all. This unity has its source in the oneness of the triune God, who
     has adopted us as His children."—Fundamental Beliefs, No. 13.

si   13. In addition to relieving suffering, why was the apostle Paul con-
          cerned to take a monetary gift from the Gentile churches of
          Galatia, Macedonia, and Achaia to the poor Jewish Christians at
          Jerusalem even though he knew it might cost him his life? Rom.
          15:25-28 (compare 1 Cor. 16:1-3; Acts 20:22-25).



        "He . . . desired to meet the church at Jerusalem and bear to them the
     gifts sent by the Gentile churches to the poor brethren in Judea. And by
     this visit he hoped to bring about a firmer union between the Jewish and
     the Gentile converts to the faith."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 389.

       What steps can we take as a corporate body to preserve the unity of
     the Adventist Church? How can each individual member of the
     church contribute to spiritual unity?

     IV. MESSIANIC PROMISES REPEATED (Eze. 37:24-28).

     14. What additional role does God now ascribe to the Messiah in ad-
         dition to His shepherding the people? Whose work will He take
         over? Eze. 37:24, 25.



     15. What covenant would God make with His people? Eze. 37:25-28
         (compare Jer. 32:37-44; 31:31-34; Heb. 8:6-12).



        These glorious promises were designed to arouse the despondent exiles.
     In a few years God would resurrect what now appeared to be an extinct na-
     tion. The Messiah was coming! Ezekiel's contemporary Daniel had even
     identified the time of His advent (Dan. 9:24-27). But the passing of time
                                                                               89
 Lesson 12                                                      June 22

dimmed the vision. Israel did not recognize her Shepherd-King when He
came (John 1:11) and chose a Roman Caesar for her ruler instead (John
19:15). The fatal choice forever shattered that aspect of God's covenant by
which He regarded literal Israel as the chosen people.

16. When will these Messianic promises find their general fulfill-
    ment? Rev. 21:1-4 (compare 22:1-3; Luke 1:31-33).



   The unbelief and rejection of the Messiah by national Israel has affected
the fulfillment of these prophecies. As given to Israel the prophecies of
permanent restoration were conditional upon their continuing faithfulness
to the Lord. The Messianic age began with Christ's first advent and con-
tinues in connection with His King-Priest reign in heaven (Heb. 8:1, 2;
1 Cor. 15:25; Col. 1:13), and will find its culmination in the new earth
(Rev. 21:2; 22:3).

WHAT CAN I DO?
   • If Al and his wife had been members of your congregation, what
would you have done to help them?
   • What in this lesson suggests that we should never hesitate to share
our faith in Jesus with persons who seem most unlikely to respond?
   • Israel achieved national unity in the restoration, but in time
developed a number of individual groups: Pharisees, Sadducees, Herodi-
ans, Zealots, and Essenes. What evidence is there of a similar kind of plu-
ralism within the church today? How can such divisions be prevented?

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read "The Coming of a
Deliverer," Prophets and Kings, pp. 681-702.

SUMMARY: The valley of dry bones has many lessons. Primarily it pro-
trayed the ruined nation that God promised to revive, reform, and restore
in anticipation of the coming Messiah. The mighty Spirit who revived
Israel is still able to awaken those who are spiritually and physically dead.

      What Might Have Been
THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ezekiel 38-48 (in part).
SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "And the name of the city from that day
 PM
      shall be, The Lord is there" (Ezekiel 48:35).

WHAT WAS THE EFFECT OF ISRAEL'S REJECTION OF THE
MESSIAH? Did the sins of ancient Israel and their ultimate repudiation
of the covenant relationship with God annul the fulfillment of His prom-
ises to them?

OUTLINE:
   I. The Israel of God (Gal. 6:15, 16).
  11. Conditional Covenant Promises (Deut. 28:1, 2, 15).
 I11. The Last Battle (Eze. 38, 39).
 IV. The Temple and Ritual (Eze. 40:1-47:12).
  V. The Land and the City (Eze. 47:13-48:35).

WHAT ARE OUR PRIORITIES? Dr. Walter Beach, former secretary of
the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, writes of a visit with a
former classmate, a woman of distinction and refinement. As they chatted,
he began to sense something had happened since school days. Her relation-
ship with God had become distant, a mere intellectual curiosity.
     "Well, Mary," he finally asked, "what is your concern right now?"
     With a bright smile she replied, "Oh, my preoccupation at the moment
is the organization of a society for the promotion of goodwill toward cats
and dogs in our community—the Lord knows how badly it is needed."
     Dr. Beach was stunned. Certainly, it is noble to work for the betterment
of pets. But we should put much more enthusiasm and talent to meeting the
needs of God's people. (Adapted. W. R. Beach, "Focusing," These Times,
December 1967, p. 16.)
     We can only wonder what Mary might have accomplished had her pri-
ority been the service of God and the salvation of her fellow beings. The
label "What might have been" could be pinned on many persons, even
some who profess to serve God.
     "What might have been" can be written across Ezekiel 38-48, the
Scripture basis for this week's study. In spite of the Lord's inspiring prom-
ises, the record is that national Israel largely failed to respond and eventu-
ally separated herself from the covenant. While Ezekiel records "what
 might have been," the writers of the New Testament foretell what will be,
 that is, how the general specifications of Ezekiel's promises will be ful-
 filled to spiritual Israel.

                                                                           91

I. THE ISRAEL OF GOD (Gal. 6:15, 16).

1. According to the apostle Paul, who in the nation of Israel were
   true Jews? Rom. 2:28, 29; 9:6-8.



   The apostle's point is that mere physical descent from Abraham does
not automatically constitute one a child of God, a part of the Israel of faith.
Like Isaac, a true Jew (whether one in the flesh, or a Gentile by race) must
have a supernatural birth, must be "born again," "born from above"
(John 3). Such spiritual Jews were present in every generation throughout
Israel's history, even in the times of deepest apostasy. (See 1 Kings 19:18;
Eze. 20:37, 38.)

2. In Jesus' parable of the vineyard who was represented by the son?
   What was His fate at the hands of the husbandmen? What judg-
   ment did Jesus pronounce on the wicked husbandmen? Matt.
   21:37-43.



   The vineyard represented the nation Israel. (See Isa. 5:1-7.) The
husbandmen represented the leadership of the nation, and the servants
symbolized the prophets God sent from time to time to call the nation to
account.
   In a larger sense the vineyard represented the moral vineyard of the
world, attended by the nation Israel. Their task was to reach out to nations
around them and to cultivate the faith of the true God. (See Isa. 56:6, 7.)
But the Saviour pointed out what would happen to the nation if it rejected
Him. God would take from them the privileges and responsibilities of
being His agents. These would pass to other persons who would have the
task of representing God to the world. (See 1 Peter 2:9, 10; Rom. 11:1-5,
16-26; Gal. 3:7-9, 16, 27-29.)

  It is sometimes charged that God showed partiality in favoring
national Israel over non-Jewish peoples. What is the evidence that this
charge is not true? Why was Israel chosen to be God's agent?

H. CONDITIONAL COVENANT PROMISES (Deut. 28:1, 2, 15).

3. What is the evidence that covenant promises are conditional?
   Deut. 28:1, 2, 15 (compare Jer. 18:7-10).



   Some Christians believe that God's promises are unconditional; that is,
that they are not restricted by conditions—that once God has promised
something, He cannot retract it regardless of what His people may do.
Such a position is contrary to the clear biblical evidence that both covenant
promises and curses depend on the response of the believer. It is altogether
92
      What Might Have Been                                         June 29
    possible to break a covenant relationship with God and thereby cease to be
    the recipient of His covenant promises. (See Lev. 26:15, 16.) The fulfill-
    ment of the promises made to Israel was conditional on their obedience to
    God's will. (See 1 Kings 2:2-4.)

•   4. When the Messiah came long after the restoration, how was He
       received by His covenant people? John 1:11 (compare 19:14, 15;
       Luke 19:41-44).



       " 'If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things
    which belong unto thy peace!—' Here the Saviour paused, and left unsaid
    what might have been the condition of Jerusalem had she accepted the help
    that God desired to give her—the gift of His beloved Son. If Jerusalem
    had known what it was her privilege to know, and had heeded the light
    which Heaven had sent her, she might have stood forth in the pride of
    prosperity, the queen of kingdoms, free in the strength of her God-given
    power. There would have been no armed soldiers standing at her gates, no
    Roman banners waving from her walls. The glorious destiny that might
    have blessed Jerusalem had she accepted her Redeemer rose before the
    Son of God. . . .
       "But the bright picture of what Jerusalem might have been fades from
    the Saviour's sight. He realizes what she now is under the Roman yoke,
    bearing the frown of God, doomed to His retributive judgment."—The
    Desire of Ages, pp. 576, 577.

    5. According to Jeremiah and Ezekiel, with whom did God intend to
       renew the covenant in the Messianic age? Jer. 31:31 (compare
       Heb. 8:10). With whom did Jesus actually establish His covenant?
       Matt. 26:20, 28; 1 Cor. 11:25 ("testament" = "covenant").



       It is evident from the New Testament that Jesus established or renewed
    the divine covenant not with national Israel, who rejected God's kingship,
    but with "spiritual Israel," the remnant of the nation, in the person of His
    disciples who accepted Him as the Messiah. (See Rom. 11:5.)

    6. How does this shift in the covenant relationship to spiritual Israel
       affect the fulfillment of the prophetic promises made to national
       Israel?



       With the establishment of the covenant with the Christian church ("the
    Israel of God," Gal. 6:15, 16), fulfillment of the prophetic promises to
    Israel has been affected in certain specific ways:
       a. Some prophetic promises will never be fulfilled.
       b. Those prophecies capable of fulfillment will be fulfilled in general.
    The main features will be fulfilled for Christ's worldwide church. The
                                                                             93
 Lesson 13                                                       June 29
church is not limited to the original setting of the prophecies in Palestine.
    c. The only safe way to know which prophetic promises will be ful-
filled and in what manner they will be fulfilled is to examine how the in-
spired writers of the New Testament applied them.
    d. Since the prophetic promises of the covenant have become the in-
heritance of spiritual Israel (Gal. 3:29; 6:15, 16), they no longer can apply
exclusively to physical Jewry. Contrary to popular opinion, the present
state of modern Israel is not a fulfillment of the covenant promises.

I11. THE LAST BATTLE (Eze. 38, 39).

   These two chapters deal with the same subject and have been made the
basis for sensational speculation. They are addressed to a person named
Gog who leads an enormous host in battle against Israel at some point in
time after her restoration from Babylonian captivity. God intervenes and
destroys the enemy multitudes. Israel is occupied seven months in burying
the fallen foe (Eze. 39:12). Their weapons provide firewood for seven
years (Eze. 39:9). This great invasion and the destruction of such powerful
forces have never taken place.

7. When was this invasion expected to occur? Eze. 38:3, 8, 9, 11, 12;
   39:21-23, 27, 28.



    Note the constant reference to Israel's Babylonian captivity. The ex-
pressions "latter years" and "latter days" (Eze. 38:8, 16) do not refer to
the end of the world, but to a time after Israel had been restored from her
captivity and was enjoying the marked prosperity promised. Jealous na-
tions distant from Israel's Near Eastern neighbors would believe that they
could plunder Israel as Babylon once had done.
    God will intervene in Israel's behalf, and the invading peoples will
learn that the Babylonian conquest was due to Israel's iniquity and their
consequent forfeiting God's protection (Eze. 39:23). God promised to
defend His trusting people whom He has brought back from exile. It is evi-
dent from the prophecy itself that this envisioned battle cannot be related
to the present-day political scene of the Middle East.
    Since the battle did not take place in the time when national Israel was
still in covenant relationship with God, does it follow that this is one of the
prophecies that will never be fulfilled? We must examine the New Testa-
ment for its insight.

8. Where does the apostle John foresee the great battle taking place?
   Rev. 20:7-9.



   The apostle sees the fulfillment of Ezekiel 38-39 in the great battle
that Satan directs against the New Jerusalem at the close of the millen-
nium. The nations of the lost are referred to as "Gog and Magog," and
their numbers are "as the sand of the sea. The battleground is the earth,
94
       What Might Have Been                                            June 29
      not the "mountains of Israel." The thrust is against "spiritual Israel"—the
      redeemed within the Holy City. God intervenes on behalf of the redeemed,
      and the hosts of the lost are destroyed by fire "from God out of heaven."
      It is evident that the major specifications of Ezekiel's prophecy will be ful-
      filled. Details of specific nations, burial of corpses, the gathering of
      weapons for firewood, and other features of the Old Testament prophecy
      are not necessarily relevant.

      9. In what way does John make a second allusion to the great battle
         of God against His enemies? Compare Eze. 39:17-20; Rev. 19:17-
         19.



         Revelation 12:7 indicates that sin began as a "war" in heaven. The
      prophecy then forecasts that Satan will "make war with the remnant" in
      the end-time (Rev. 12:17). This latter reference alludes to the final conflict
      over the law of God—over the Sabbath (the seal of God) and over "the
      mark of the beast" (Rev. 13:13-17; 14:9, 10). But this "war" basically is
      against Christ, who will deliver His loyal followers at His coming (Rev.
      19:11-16, 19), and will give His enemies up to destruction.

         Satan attacks God's people. "The remnant church will be brought
      into great trial and distress. Those who keep the commandments of God
      and the faith of Jesus will feel the ire of the dragon and his hosts. Satan
      numbers the world as his subjects, he has gained control of the apostate
      churches; but here is a little company that are resisting his supremacy. If
      he could blot them from the earth, his triumph would be complete. As
      he influenced the heathen nations to destroy Israel, so in the near future
      he will stir up the wicked powers of earth to destroy the people of God.
      All will be required to render obedience to human edicts in violation of
      the divine law. Those who will be true to God and to duty will be
      menaced, denounced, and proscribed. They will be betrayed 'both by
      parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends.' Luke 21:16."—Tes-
      timonies, vol. 9, p. 231.
WED   IV. THE TEMPLE AND RITUAL (Eze. 40:1-47:12).

         Ezekiel 40-48 is one continuous prophecy, apparently given to the
      prophet on the Day of Atonement in 573 B.C., fourteen years after the de-
      struction of Jerusalem. Revelation chapter 11:1, 2 is parallel, depicting the
      restoration of the sanctuary on the antitypical Day of Atonement.

      10. Where did Ezekiel seem to be taken? Eze. 40:2 (compare Rev.
          21:10). What does the man in the vision measure out for the
          prophet? Eze. 40:3-5; 41:1.



      11. As the prophet watched the man in his vision measure the Tem-
          ple and its various parts, what event occurred? Eze. 43:1-9. What
                                                                                  95
      Lesson 13                                                      June 29
          did this aspect of the vision signify? Compare Eze. 11:23.



        The return of the Lord to the Temple of Ezekiel's vision, the cherubim
     supporting His throne and bringing Him in by way of the east gate, was a
     reminder to the prophet of God's abandonment of Solomon's Temple prior
     to its destruction. Now, the comforting assurance is given that God would
     dwell among His people again and be their God, if they would be truly His
     covenant people.

     12. After recording all the data regarding the new Temple, what was
         Ezekiel to do with the information? For what purpose? Eze.
         43:10, 11. (If you have the SDA Bible Commentary, study the
         Temple floor plan in vol. 4, p. 716.)



        The plan was conditional. Ezekiel saw a representation in vision of a
     real Temple. Had Israel responded wholeheartedly to God's restoration
     plans, it would have been built. It would have functioned, however, during
     the era before the atoning death of the Messiah brought the ritual system to
     an end. (See Dan. 9:27.)
        Thus it is evident that this prophecy of the Temple and its services as
     seen by Ezekiel will never be fulfilled. It is a description of "what might
     have been."


is   13. According to the apostle John, what will constitute the "temple"
         in the Holy City on the new earth? Rev. 21:22.



     14. What did Ezekiel see flowing out of the Temple? Eze. 47:1. Who
         also was shown a similar scene? Joel 3:18. Describe the rest of the
         scene. Eze. 47:2-12; compare Rev. 22:1-4.



        The vision described a stream flowing from the Temple eastward into
     the Jordan Valley. It grew deeper as its life-giving waters surged through
     the Jordan Valley, eventually "healing" the Dead Sea of its saltiness. Fish
     abounded in this watercourse, and fruit trees flourished along its banks.
        In Revelation no details are given regarding depth of the river, its heal-
     ing properties, its fish, or the fruit trees on its banks. Only the principal
     idea is found: that a river issues from God's throne and that on either side
     grows the tree of life with its special fruits and its healing powers.

     V. THE LAND AND THE CITY (Eze. 47:13-48:35).

       The prophet was directed to outline the borders of the restored nation
     (Eze. 47:13-21). The data given suggests the area originally promised to

Israel. However, the returned exiles never occupied more than the area of
Judah. In chapter 48 Ezekiel is directed to lay out the land for the several
tribes.

15. Had Israel fulfilled the divine purpose, how much land would it
    have eventually occupied? Rom. 4:13. How much land will the Is-
    rael of faith possess? Matt. 5:5; 2 Peter 3:13.



16. The concluding portion of Ezekiel's vision focused on the ideal
    Jerusalem. What is its geometric shape? How many gates are set
    in its walls and where? What tribal names are attached? Eze.
    48:30-35; compare Rev. 21:9-27.



HOW CAN THE THINGS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BECOME
A REALITY?
   • "What might have been" are sad words. What would you do differ-
ently in your life if you could live it over again? Is there someone whom
you can help avoid the mistakes you have made?
   • How can a person who recognizes what his life "might have been"
redirect it into a fruitful experience? (See Jer. 18:1-6.)
   • The church now has taken the role of Israel and is God's appointed
agency for the salvation of humanity. What can you do to further the
church's witness? (See The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 9-16.)

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read "The House of
Israel," Prophets and Kings, pp. 703-721.

SUMMARY: The fulfillment of the promises made to national Israel de-
pended upon her faithfulness to her covenant with God. Because these
promises also relate to the salvation of the world, Israel's failure could not
prevent their fulfillment. God has chosen the Christian church as His new
agent. The New Testament writers indicate which promises will meet ful-
fillment and in what manner.

         Lessons for Third Quarter, 1991
    Sabbath School members who have not received a copy of the Adult Lessons
for the third quarter of 1991 will be helped by the following outline in studying the
first two lessons. The title of the series is Living for His Coming. This quarter's les-
sons cover the books of 1 and 2 Thessalonians.
First Lesson: "Responding to the Divine Call"

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Acts 17:1-11; 1 Thessalonians 1:1-6; 2:1-12.
MEMORY TEXT: Acts 16:9.
     TO BE SUCCESSFUL SOUL-WINNERS we must enter into a personal re-
lationship with Jesus and follow His methods and those of the apostles. The minis-
try of Paul provides valuable principles for evangelistic outreach. The witness of
the new believers in Thesslonica illustrates the power of personal testimony.

OUTLINE:
   I. Large City Evangelism (Acts 17:1).
  11. Paul's Evangelistic Strategy (Acts 17:2).
 I11. The Heart of the Message (Acts 17:3; 1 Thess. 5:1, 2).
 IV. The Power of Personal Testimony (1 Thess. 2:8).
  V. Other Principles for Soul-Winners (1 Thess. 1:1).
Second Lesson: "Results and Resistance at Thessalo-
nica"

THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Acts 17:1-9; 1 Thessalonians 2:13, 14.
MEMORY TEXT: 1 Thessalonians 1:6.
   VICTORY IN SPITE OF OBSTACLES. Satan does not yield territory and
subjects willingly. Since Eden, preaching the Word has inspired his fiercest hatred.
But, in spite of determined opposition by the enemies of the Christian cause, God's
Word and people endure, and He wins His case in the Great Controversy.

OUTLINE:
   I. The Word Bears Fruit (Acts 17:4).
  11. Preaching Brings Persecution (Acts 17:5; 1 Thess. 2:15, 16).
 I11. The Believers' Response to Persecution (1 Thess. 1:6; 2:14;
      2 Thess. 1:4, 5).
 IV. The True Source of Persecution (Rev. 12:1-5).
  V. The Reasons for Persecution (Rev. 12:17).

       In John 3:14 we find Jesus elling Nicodemus that
     must be "lifted up" on the c ss. To lift up is to place

     on the cross becomes the beings are drawn toge
