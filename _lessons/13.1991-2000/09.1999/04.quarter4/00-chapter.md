        to This Guide's Lessons

   Enrique Chaij was born and reared
in a Seventh-day Adventist home in
the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina.
While growing up, he had the opportu-
nity to become acquainted with the secu-
lar mind and nonreligious people. In
later years, this experience would be-
come the inspiration for influencing his
choice of higher studies and his minis-
try, which is oriented to evangelizing
the secular world.
   As a preacher, Elder Chaij founded
and directed, for 33 years, the radio
program Una Luz en el Camino ("A
Light on the Way"), which, after many
years, was instrumental in leading thousands to Jesus Christ and into
the Seventh-day Adventist Church. He also pioneered and directed
the TV program Encuentro con la Vida ("Encounter With Life"),
which is being broadcast via a thousand cable channels today.
   Enrique Chaij served as a departmental secretary in the Austral
Union. He was also an editor for a publishing house in South America.
As a writer, he created scripts for a radio and TV program with an
audience of 9,000. He also authored 16 books, 3 Bible courses by
correspondence, and many other editorial works.
   He participated in many evangelistic campaigns and taught courses
on radio and TV production, human relations, and family counsel-
ing. He has a B.A. degree in theology, a M.A. in Communication-
Broadcasting, and a Ph.D. in Communication. His doctoral disserta-
tion was on a mass-communication methodology, targeted to reach
the secular society.
   Dr. Chaij is now retired, but he is very busy writing new books.
He and his wife, Nelda, have two children, with whom they enjoy an
active and happy Christian family.

      The Church in Today's World
    Beginning in 1996, the Seventh-day Adventist Church embarked
on a worldwide program of emphasis on the "Message and Mission"
of the church. The idea is to focus each year, through the year 2000,
on a particular theme or topic that is vital to the life of the world
church. As the title of the program indicates, the themes chosen
revolve around the message of the church and how that message
relates to its mission.
    One of the message-and-mission annual emphases is on Christian
community, the reason for the existence of the remnant church and
its role in today's world.
    The two fundamental beliefs 11 and 12 are the focus of the lessons
presented in this Bible Study Guide. (See Seventh-day Adventists
Believe . . . , pp. 134-169.)
    This quarter we will seek answers to the following questions:
     1. How is God's church not only a mere congregation but a
loving fellowship with a purpose to reach the world?
     2. What does it mean to be a new person in Christ?
     3. How can we build a united church whose members maintain a
solid spiritual life?
     4. How can the church cultivate Christian love?
     5. What should our attitude be toward people who are not yet
members of God's family?
     6. How can God's diverse family maintain unity as a worldwide
church?
     7. How is it possible for Christians to live in the world without
being of the world?
     8. How is it possible for the church to be a group of holy people?
     9. What does it mean for the church to be salt and light? How do
we become such agents?
    10. How does a Christian home benefit both society and the
 church?
    11. How can each church and each member reach a higher level of
spirituality and avoid being absorbed by the worldly current of life?
    12. What is the final crisis? How does it involve God's church?
 And how can we come through it victoriously?
    13. How does the church prepare for Christ's second coming?
 What will we as individuals do? How will the Second Coming
 motivate our decisions and the way we live, both as a church and as
 individuals?
     While we stay in the world, we will continue to endure tempta-
 tions and Satan's destructive intents (Rev. 12:12). But we do not
 need to fear (Ps. 46:1, 2). "Nothing else in this world is so dear to
 God as His church. Nothing is guarded by Him with such jealous
 care."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 42.

   The art and joy of Sabbath keeping is becoming lost. Many find
that their Sabbath experiences have become either habit-driven
forms and practices that have lost all meaning or nonsacred play and
                                       recreation to pass the hours.

               We Are a Family
                                               „sooer




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Pss. 27:10; 34:8; Isa. 41:10;
Jer. 31:3; John 3:16; Rom. 5:5; 1 Pet. 2:9.

    MEMORY TEXT: "Here are My mother and My brothers! For
    whoever does the will of My Father in heaven is My brother
    and sister and mother" (Matthew 12:49, 50, NKJV).

  KEY QUESTIONS: As you study this week, search for the an-
swers to these questions: How does God's love make a church not
merely a congregation but a loving fellowship of brothers and sisters?
How does God use such fellowship to spread His love and truth in the
world?

    WE ARE NOT ISLANDS. In God's family, we neither are distant
nor isolated from one another. We form a united group, bound to-
gether by the same ideals and spiritual principles. Such unity is the
result of the Holy Spirit's work in our hearts and is noted especially
for its Christian love. Such love and unity provide a brilliant contrast
to the chaos of the secular world contrasted in the chart below:

    SECULAR SOCIETY                          GOD'S FAMILY
    Fathers often neglect children           Ps. 27:10
    Spiritual orphans                        Isa. 41:10
    Loneliness/Despair                       John 13:35

  Pray that with the Holy Spirit's guidance you will be able to help
make God's family a fitting example of His love.

Sunday                                           September 26
MORE THAN A CONGREGATION (Matt. 12:49, 50; 7:21).

  Upon what two conditions does Jesus establish His spiritual
family? Matt. 12:49, 50; 2 Cor. 6:17, 18.
  How are these conditions related to each other?

   The family of God is not merely a social club that gets together
now and again to have a good time. Neither is it just a congregation,
meeting once or twice a week in a church building. Instead, it is a
group of people who are happy to do their heavenly Father's will.
There is no greater evidence of our love for Christ and His church than
choosing His will over our own. As David prayed, so will we, "Teach
me to do Your will, for You are my God; Your Spirit is good. Lead me
in the land of uprightness" (Ps. 143:10, NKJV).
    Jesus tells us in Matthew 7:21 that being His true disciple is not a
mere profession, but a doing of His will.
   "Lord, Lord. To address Christ as 'Lord' is to profess the belief
that He is indeed the Messiah, and implies that the speaker has as-
sumed the role of disciple.
    "He that doeth. That is, he who performs the will of God when he
learns of it. Faith in God must accompany the doing, or the doing is
only a form. It is true that 'faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being
alone' (James 2:17), but it is equally true that works unaccompanied
by a sincere and living faith are also 'dead' (Heb. 11:6). Those who do
not know the will of God are not held accountable for it (Luke 12:47,
48), but those who have heard God's voice speaking to their hearts
and yet persist in ways of their own choosing 'have no cloke for their
sin' (John 15:22) and are in danger of presumption."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 5, p. 358.

   How does doing God's will relate to prayer? 1 John 5:14 (com-
pare Matt. 6:9, 10; 26:39, 42). How does this make the church a
force in the world?


  "Prayer rightly considered is not a device for employing the re-
sources of omnipotence to fulfil our own desires, but a means by
which our desires may be redirected according to the mind of God,
and made into channels for the forces of his will."—C. H. Dodd. What
power we, as God's family, would have to transform the lives of
people living in a secular society if our prayers would match this one
condition!

   In what ways has God taught you to do His will? Share with
 someone what you have learned about following God's will.

                                                                        7

GOD SETS THE TONE (1 John 3:1; John 3:16).

   All Scripture is a revelation of God's love. Even among our trials
and personal difficulties we can perceive the helping hand of our
loving Father. (How has this been so in your life?)
   Divine love reaches every member of our spiritual family. It reaches
us individually in the hours of temptation, loneliness, adversity, and
persecution. It also reaches us corporately as we work together around
the world to spread the gospel.

   What assurance do we have for those times when we do not
sense the reality of His love? John 3:16; 1 John 4:8. What differ-
ence does this make to God's family if its members do/do not
understand this truth about God?


    Because of His love, what claim can God make on us? Ps. 24:1.


   We belong to God. This sense of belonging reminds us that we
should always trust Him and depend on Him as our Creator, Father,
and Lord. What a great lesson to be learned: to depend always and in
everything on our loving Lord. Jesus tells us, "I am the vine, you are
the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for
without me You can do nothing" (John 15:5, NKJV).
   "Those who accept Christ as their personal Saviour are not left as
orphans, to bear the trials of life alone. He receives them as members
of the heavenly family; He bids them call His Father their Father.
They are His 'little ones,' dear to the heart of God, bound to Him by
the most tender and abiding ties. He has toward them an exceeding
tenderness, as far surpassing what our father or mother has felt toward
us in our helplessness as the divine is above the human."—The Desire
of Ages, p. 327.
   The more we depend on God, the more spiritual power we will
receive from Him (2 Cor. 12:9). We can grow in our friendship with
Him. We can improve our family life. Also we can be wiser in our
decisions and stronger in our faith.

   How do you give thanks to God for His love? How do you
respond with your love to Him?


  List six ways you can share His love with someone this week.
Do at least three of these and be prepared to share your experi-
ence with the class on Sabbath.

WE ARE MEMBERS OF ONE FAMILY (1 John 4:21; John 13:34,
35).

   Being united in love helps us to develop a sense of family. As a
result, we can call each other "brother" or "sister" and treat one
another as such. This was the practice in the apostolic days (see Acts
1:15,16; 2 Thess. 1:3). Even Christ is not ashamed to call us brothers
and sisters (Heb. 2:11).

  How does Matthew 6:9 reinforce the fact that we are sisters and
brothers in Christ?


  How do Christ and the Holy Spirit create a united church
family? Eph. 2:13-16; Rom. 8:14; 5:5.

   Christ

   The Holy Spirit

   We are brothers and sisters in God the Father, in God the Holy
Spirit, and also in God the Son. God abolished all barriers among His
followers through the cross of Christ. New life in Christ brings union
instead of division; love instead of hate; cooperation instead of self-
ishness; humility instead of pride. In summary, "We have passed from
death to life because we love one another" (1 John 3:14, NRSV).
   God pours out His love in our hearts through His Spirit. As a result,
we can love, understand, and forgive one another.
   "When Christ dwells in the heart, the soul will be so filled with His
love, with the joy of communion with Him, that it will cleave to Him;
and in the contemplation of Him, self will be forgotten. Love to Christ
will be the spring of action. . . . A profession of Christ without this
deep love, is mere talk, dry formality, and heavy drudgery."—Steps to
Christ, pp. 44, 45.

  How do people around us recognize that we are disciples of
Christ? Is it because we say we love one another? John 13:34, 35.
Explain.


   If we would have the Holy Spirit poured out on our church
 family, what would the Spirit change in us? How could that
 change the way we relate to one another, the way we witness?
 How will I tell others about His family?


                                                                       9

WE ARE NOT ALONE (Matt. 28:20; Isa. 41:10).

    Just a few minutes before starting an overseas trip, a man went to a
little boy standing on the dock and told him, "In a moment my ship
will depart, and I do not have any friends to tell me good-bye. Would
you take my handkerchief and wave it as a sign of farewell while the
boat is leaving?" The man could not bear his loneliness. As the ship
set sail, he felt happy seeing the boy wave that big white handkerchief.
    Like this lonely traveler, too many women and men feel alone in
the journey of life! We lack the sensitivity, companionship, and warmth
of genuine human contact. Truly, loneliness is one of the most com-
mon conditions of our time. It is not necessarily the absence of com-
pany, but the sense of estrangement and abandonment. We live with
people, yet feel alone. Even among Christians this is a common prob-
lem. Often, we can become so busy doing good works and volunteer-
ing for the church that we neglect genuine fellowship and recreation.

     How can we overcome or prevent this problem? Ps. 68:4-6.


   " To, I am with you always, even to the end of the age' " (Matt.
28:20, NKJV). What a marvelous prescription for loneliness we find
in Christ's promise to us! The Lord is at our side always, every day,
every moment, without any break or vacation. We can renew this
divine company at the beginning of the day, at any moment in need.

   Explain what the Lord promises to do for us in one of His most
beautiful promises. Isa. 41:10. How has He fulfilled this promise
in your life?


  Are we sick? Jesus stays by our bed.
  Are we far from home? He travels with us.
  Have we lost a close relative or friend? He gives us strength and
consolation.
  Do we have fears? He comes to us and takes them away.
  Are we in danger or under threat? He protects us against our
enemies.

   Psalm 68:6 tells us that "God sets the solitary in families"
(NKJV). Think of someone in your church or neighborhood who
has little or no family nearby. Plan three ways you can include
this person in your family's activities and initiate one of these
ways within the month.

A FAMILY WITH A PURPOSE (Gen. 12:2, 3; 1 Pet. 2:9; Matt.
28:19).

    Every earthly family needs to have goals and plans to reach those
goals. Such goals might include the size of the family, the future of the
children, the style of the house, the spiritual prosperity of the family,
etc.
    God's family has goals and plans. Our heavenly Father Himself has
specific aims for His church and its members and has the plans to ful-
fill them.

  What purpose did God have for His people from the very
beginning? Gen. 12:2, 3.


   "The people of God are His representatives upon the earth, and He
intends that they shall be lights in the moral darkness of this world.
Scattered all over the country, in the towns, cities, and villages, they
are God's witnesses, the channels through which He will communi-
cate to an unbelieving world the knowledge of His will and the
wonders of His grace."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 134.
   "His [Christ's] followers are not to feel themselves detached from
the perishing world around them. They are a part of the great web of
humanity; and Heaven looks upon them as brothers to sinners as well
as to saints. The fallen, the erring, and the sinful, Christ's love em-
braces; and every deed of kindness done to uplift a fallen soul, every
act of mercy, is accepted as done to Him."—The Desire of Ages,
p. 638.

   How does Peter declare God's objective for His people? 1 Pet.
2:9 (compare Matt. 28:19).


   All the descriptions by which Peter calls God's family have one
purpose: to communicate in different ways the love of Christ and His
salvation. To do something else, or to profess only a creed, is to
misunderstand the true religion of Christ.

    Are your goals and plans as a Christian consistent with God's
 goals and plans for His family? Why are deeds of kindness and
 acts of mercy good ways for meeting God's goals for the church
 family? How well did you fulfill God's goals yesterday? Pray
 that today God will help you to be a more loving sister or
 brother to "sinners as well as to saints."


                                                                       11

FURTHER STUDY: How does the parable of the prodigal son
(Luke 15:11-32) help you to answer the Key Questions in Sabbath's
lesson?
   Read Steps to Christ, chapter 1, "Christian Service."

   "The NT has 2 words for love, agape, with its associated verb
agapao, 'to love,' and the verb phileo, 'to like,' to have affection
for,' to love.' . . .
   "Agape is a principle, and may be described as a love of respect and
esteem, a love bringing into play the higher powers of the mind and
intelligence. It is this kind of love that the Christian is to exercise even
toward his enemies (Mt. 5:44)."—SDA Bible Dictionary, on "Love,"
(1979 edition), p. 682.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Describe what your church would be if all the members were
     like you. How does a loving attitude allow you to disagree
     sometimes with your brothers and sisters in the church with-
     out being disagreeable?

     2. Contrast the blessings of belonging to God's family with the
        loneliness a secular person might suffer.

     3. How can we enjoy being a part of God's family? One answer
        is given for you. Think of at least three others. Answer: We
        can always count on our Father's love, presence, and pro-
        tection.

     4. What would you do to improve the situation if you belonged
        to a lukewarm church?

     5. Design a "Family Crest" for your church that would repre-
        sent:
        a. how you show love for/to Christ;
        b. how you share the gospel with your community;
        c. how you show love to the poor in our church/community;
        d. what you value above all else;
        e. how you want others to describe your church;
        f. your major goal.

SUMMARY: God is the Father of a great church family on earth. He
loves this family with an everlasting love. Because of this love, we can
depend on Him and be happy doing His will. Through Him, members
of this family are sisters and brothers in Christ.

        Pentecost's Flames Touch India, Part 1
                          J. H. Zachary
    During late 1996 and early 1997 nearly sixty Protestant pastors
in eastern India were baptized into the Adventist Church. But
many wondered if they would be faithful to the new Bible truths
they had accepted. Recently I heard some of these pastors share
how God is working in their lives. Let me introduce a few of them.
    Pastor P. Ponda is a third-generation pastor. He was leading
30 independent congregations when he met some Adventist pas-
tors. As the pastors discussed Bible truths, Pastor Ponda began to
understand the Bible basis for Adventist teachings. He requested
baptism. "I want the Adventist Church to shepherd my nearly
four thousand people," he said. To date, nearly half of his mem-
bers have been baptized.
    When Assish Missal completed his seminary training, he felt a
burden to reach the tribal people living in the mountains near his
home. Then he attended a revival meeting conducted by Adventist
evangelist Bhasker Rao. As he understood and accepted the Bible
basis for Adventist teachings, he requested rebaptism. When
word of his conversion reached his home town, he was expelled
from the village and church officials canceled plans for a village
marriage for his sister. Undaunted, Missal has formed three
Adventist congregations in his community.
    Absalom Maik was a priest before he accepted the Sabbath
message and was baptized. He became a lay preacher. An angry
crowd surrounded his family's house and threatened to take his
 life, but Maik's brother persuaded the mob to leave. However,
 Maik was excommunicated from the village and is not permitted
 even to draw water from the village well. His converts have lost
 the privilege of being buried in the village graveyard. But Maik
 continues to witness. Within a year Brother Maik had prepared
120 persons for baptism.
     Pastor Vijaha Lima attended The Quiet Hour revival and was
 baptized. He went from home to home in his village, sharing the
 Bible-based teachings he had learned. Eighty persons accepted
 the truth and requested baptism. The new believers were told to
 leave the village. When one of the believers died, the village
 refused to allow the Adventists to bury him in the village cem-
 etery. They buried him in a lonely spot near the river.
                                     (continued next week)
  J. H. Zachary is international evangelism coordinator for The Quiet
Hour in Redlands, California.

          New Persons in Christ




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Isa. 55:6, 7; Eph. 2:1-10;
4:17-24; Gal. 5:16-26.

     MEMORY TEXT: "God, who is rich in mercy, because of His
     great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in
     trespasses, made us alive together with Christ" (Ephesians 2:4,
     5, NKJV).

   KEY QUESTIONS: As you study this week's lesson, look for
answers to these questions: Before people find Christ, what are they
like? What can we become after we accept His salvation? And how
does such a transformation take place?

   A TIME OF CHANGE. People have been talking about the changes
and new ideas they hope to see during the new millennium. Some look
for changes in the industrial world while others crave new ideas in
communications. Still others are eager for advancement in standards
of living, family life, education, and moral customs. But no change
could be as important as the change only God can make in one's life.
   What is this change? It is the transformation made by God in the
human mind and heart (Ezek. 36:26, 27; 2 Cor. 5:17).
   "In the heart renewed by divine grace, love . . . modifies the
character,. governs the impulses, controls the passions, subdues en-
mity, and ennobles the affections."—Steps to Christ, p. 59.
   Last week, we looked at being members of God's family. This week
we will see how that helps us become people with a new future and a
new hope.

Sunday                                                  October 3
B.C.—BEFORE CHRIST (Eph. 2:1-3, 12; Rom. 1:28-32).

   How does Paul describe life before Christ? Eph. 2:1-3; Rom.
1:28-32.


   No matter how good we may appear to others, sin takes possession
of our lives if Christ does not dwell within. Sinful acts weaken and
destroy the integrity of the soul. Indeed, when life is empty of Christ's
love, it is filled with sin. How were you before you met and accepted
Christ as your Savior? You may not have been a liar or an adulterer.
But were you proud, angry, bitter, legalistic, or unforgiving?
   Consider people in ancient times who did not acknowledge God
(Rom. 1:21-32). They "became futile in their thoughts, and their
foolish hearts were darkened" (v. 21, NKJV).

  What did Paul think about himself both before and after he
encountered Christ? Phil. 3:4-8.

   Before Christ



   After Christ




   "We have nothing in ourselves of which to boast. We have no
ground for self-exaltation. Our only ground of hope is in the right-
eousness of Christ imputed to us, and in that wrought by His Spirit
working in and through us."—Steps to Christ, p. 63.
   Paul's story can also be ours when we give our lives to Christ. "If
you give yourself to Him, and accept Him as your Savior, then, sinful
as your life may have been, for His sake you are accounted righteous.
Christ's character stands in place of your character, and you are
accepted before God just as if you had not sinned.
   "More than this, Christ changes the heart. He abides in your heart
by faith."—Steps to Christ, p. 62.

    The words translated sin and trespasses in Ephesians 2:1-3
 mean to "miss the mark" and a "fall" respectively. Take some
 time to examine your life. How have you "missed the mark" or
 "fallen" (taken the wrong road) where God is concerned? Pray
 that He will help you get back on course.

                                                                       15
Monday                                                 October 4
A.C.—AFTER CHRIST (Eph. 1:7, 8; 2:8, 9; 1 John 1:9, 10).

   The wide and deep grace of God reaches even the worst sinner. He
offers forgiveness to all without distinction. Certainly, God abun-
dantly pardons (Isa. 55:7).

  What is the basis of our assurance regarding God's pardon?
Eph. 1:7, 8.


    "As you see the enormity of sin, as you see yourself as you really
are, do not give up to despair. It was sinners that Christ came to save.
We have not to reconcile God to us, but—O wondrous love!—God in
Christ is 'reconciling the world unto himself(2 Cor. 5:19)."—Steps
to Christ, p. 35.
   "It is when we most fully comprehend the love of God that we best
realize the sinfulness of sin. When we see the length of the chain that
was let down for us, when we understand something of the infinite
sacrifice that Christ has made in our behalf, the heart is melted with
tenderness and contrition."—Steps to Christ, p. 36.

  What three things must we do to receive God's forgiveness?
Define each one. Acts 3:19; 1 John 1:9.

                Action                             Definition

  "The religion of Christ means more than the forgiveness of sin; it
means that sin is taken away, and that the vacuum is filled with the
Spirit. It means that the mind is divinely illumined, that the heart is
emptied of self, and filled with the presence of Christ."—Ellen G.
White, Review and Herald, June 10, 1902.

    Be honest with yourself. When have you rationalized away a
sin or blamed it on someone or something else? Ask God to help
you confess, repent, and turn to Him for forgiveness and free-
dom from that sin.

A NEW CREATION (Eph. 2:12, 13; 5:8; John 3:8; Ezek. 36:26).

  What two contrasts does Paul use to describe life before Christ
and life after Christ? Eph. 2:12, 13; 5:8.

            Before Christ                     After Christ

     "When the soul surrenders itself to Christ, a new power takes
possession of the new heart. A change is wrought which man can
never accomplish for himself. It is a supernatural work, bringing a
supernatural element into human nature."—The Desire of Ages, p. 324.
   Mary was an alcoholic. She drank several bottles of wine every
day, plus other strong drinks. When her husband arrived home in the
evenings, he frequently found her drunk with a broken bottle at her
side. This family drama lasted 25 years. Every source of help proved
useless. Every treatment ended without results. In terms of money, her
husband wasted the amount of three good houses trying to cure his
wife. But the Lord began to work when they sought His divine help.
And what they were looking for during 25 years without results, the
Lord did spectacularly in a moment! Soon after her liberation, Mary
became a noble and respectable member of our church. The Lord is
changing lives every day, everywhere.

   How did Nicodemus respond when Jesus told him, "No one can
see the kingdom of God without being born from above"? John
3:3-6, NRSV. What do you think motivated his response?


   "The Lord Jesus is making experiments on human hearts through
the exhibition of His mercy and abundant grace. He is effecting trans-
formations so amazing that Satan, with all his triumphant boasting,
with all his confederacy of evil united against God and the laws of
His government, stands viewing them as a fortress impregnable to his
sophistries and delusions. They are to him an incomprehensible mys-
tery."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 18.
   These transformations are made only by the power of the Holy Spirit
(John 3:6-8; Ezek. 36:26, 27).

   Recall the changes the Lord has made in your life. In what
 areas are you still changing and growing?


                                                                    17
Wednesday                                               October 6
THE HOLY SPIRIT IN ACTION (Rom. 8:9, 14; Eph. 4:22-32).

   As we mentioned yesterday, we obtain the new life in Christ through
the Holy Spirit. No one can make such changes through his or her own
strength. Review Jesus' teaching to Nicodemus about his need to be
born again by the Holy Spirit (John 3:6-8).

  What does Joel 2:28-32 teach us about who may receive the
Holy Spirit? (Compare Acts 2:17, 18.)


   "The Spirit awaits our demand and reception. Since this is the means
by which we are to receive power, why do we not hunger and thirst for
the gift of the Spirit? Why do we not talk of it, pray for it, and preach
concerning it?"—Christian Service, p. 252.

   The new person in Christ has an entirely new attitude regard-
ing all aspects of life. Below is a list of certain attitudes people may
have before they accept Christ. Using Ephesians 4:22-32, write
next to them the new attitudes in Christ that replace them. What
is our motivation for developing these new attitudes? Verse 32,
last part.

     falsehood

     anger

     thievery

     unwholesome talk

     bitterness, slander, malice


   "When the Spirit of God takes possession of the heart, it transforms
the life. Sinful thoughts are put away, evil deeds are renounced; love,
humility, and peace take the place of anger, envy, and strife. Joy takes
the place of sadness, and the countenance reflects the light of heaven."
—The Desire of Ages, p. 173.

   Which of the above aspects of the new self in Christ do you
think you need to work on? Have you tried to change by your-
self? How much did you gain under your own willpower? Re-
member, it is the new self in Christ!

LIKE JESUS (1 Cor. 2:16; 1 Pet. 2:21; Heb. 8:10).

   Once we receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, we are ready to imitate
Jesus. The way we talk, feel, and act will reveal that we are new per-
sons, with the desire to be like Jesus in every way. We will long to
please and glorify Him in all that we think and do. As His faithful
followers, we will long to walk with Him wherever He leads us and
will rejoice to lovingly obey His commandments.

   What is the key to being like Jesus? 1 Cor. 2:16; 2 Cor. 3:16.


   When we dedicate even our thinking to Christ, He will help us
resist bad and impure thoughts. Thus, we can have "the mind of
Christ," with thoughts that reflect His character. Both sin and holiness
begin in the mind. Even though it is the battlefield where the enemy
wants to have dominion, it is also where Christ can gain the victory for
our salvation. The decision is ours. Who will be the master of our
minds?
   "The Christian life is a life of constant conflict. It is a battle and a
march. Every act of obedience, every deed of self-denial, every trial
bravely endured, every temptation resisted, every victory gained, is a
step forward in the march to eternal triumph."—Ellen G. White, The
Signs of the Times®, October 29, 1902.
    If we have the mind of Christ, and if we look to Jesus as "the author
and finisher of our faith" (Heb. 12:2, NKJV), we shall be qualified to
"follow His steps" (1 Pet. 2:21, KJV). But we also shall be humble
enough to depend constantly on the Lord. And we shall prove the truth
of this statement:
   "Nothing can be more helpless and yet more invincible than the
soul that feels its nothingness, and relies wholly upon the merits of a
crucified and risen Saviour. God would send every angel in heaven to
the aid of the one who places his whole dependence on Christ, rather
than allow him to be overcome."—Ellen G. White, The Signs of the
 Times®, October 29, 1902.

  As we seek through God's grace to follow in Christ's steps,
what covenant promise will He Himself keep? Heb. 8:10.


    What societal influences are preventing you from developing
 "the mind of Christ"? Draw up a plan that will help you elimi-
 nate these influences from your life. Make sure your plan pro-
 vides for specific times of Bible study and prayer.

FURTHER STUDY: The Ten Commandments (Exod. 20) reflect
God's character and the new person each of us is to become in Christ.
The first four commandments reflect our love for God, while the last
six reflect our love for others. For each commandment, think of a
positive statement that reflects the attitudes and behavior a new person
in Christ is to have.
   Read Selected Messages, book 2, chap. 48; The Acts of the Apostles,
chap. 5.

   "The Christian's life is not a modification or improvement of the
old, but a transformation of nature. There is a death to self and sin, and
a new life altogether. This change can be brought about only by the
effectual working of the Holy Spirit."—The Desire of Ages, p. 172.
   However, not all church members are transformed persons. Some
of them have placed themselves a long way from the transforming
influence of the Spirit. But, "we should remember that the church,
enfeebled and defective though it be, is the only object on earth on
which Christ bestows His supreme regard. He is constantly watching it
with solicitude, and is strengthening it by His Holy Spirit."—Selected
Messages, book 2, p. 396, italics supplied.

        Pentecost's Flames Touch India, Part 2
                           J. H. Zachary

    When 60 Protestant pastors were baptized in eastern India,
many wondered whether they would remain true to their new
beliefs. Recently some of these pastors shared how God is using
them to fan the flames of Pentecost in India.
    Vijaya Maik lives in a non-Christian village. After accepting the
Adventist message, he actively shared his new faith with fellow
villagers. But some villagers complained and had him arrested and
imprisoned in an effort to stop the spread of the gospel.
    Word of his imprisonment caused even more people to want to
hear the basis for his faith. Soon 40 persons requested baptism.
Several of these new believers also were imprisoned.
    The mission president, concerned that Brother Maik's preach-
ing methods might stir up the community unnecessarily, suggested
he try different approaches. But Maik responded, "I must share
this message before Jesus comes. God will take care of me."
    When Raju Purty accepted the Adventist message, he was de-
termined to take the gospel to his friends. After several months, 25
persons requested baptism. Other villagers threatened the con-
verts, "You have one week to change your minds or be driven out
of the village!" The new converts refused to change their minds.
Barred from drawing water from the village well, they must walk
seven miles for water. They cannot bury their dead in the village
 cemetery and must find a new location for a graveyard. Brother
Purty is looking for a new place where the believers can live.
    Another pastor, Vijaya Kumar Maik, climbs steep mountain
 trails to share his new faith with tribal people. Thus far 131 per-
 sons have been baptized as a result of his work.
    After Pastor Bipin Khilo was baptized, the Lord gave him a
 burden for a very cruel tribe that lives in a remote mountain valley.
 Strangers entering their territory are met with bows and arrows.
 At great personal risk, Brother Khilo is attempting to make friends
 with this tribe and tell them about Jesus and His soon return.
     Prior to 1997, fewer than 160 persons were baptized in any one
 year in the Orissa Mission. But during 1997, 3,000 persons were
 baptized, many as a direct result of the work of these newly bap-
 tized pastors. The Quiet Hour pays the pastors a small stipend
 which allows them to work full time in evangelism.

Hour, located in Redlands, California.

        A People With the Same
            Faith and Hope




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Rev. 14:6; 2 Tim. 1:12; 2 Pet.
1:16; 1 Cor. 9:16; Titus 2:11-14; Heb. 9:28.

     MEMORY TEXT: "There is one body and one Spirit, just as
     you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith,
     one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is above all, and
     through all, and in you all" (Ephesians 4:4-6, NKJV).

  KEY QUESTION: How can we build a united church whose
members maintain a solid spiritual life in Christ and who share the
same faith and hope?

   SECURITY AMID CONFUSION. We live in a world of religious
confusion. Many people are without any kind of faith or hope. Many
others, while believing they are Christians and members of God's
family, suffer from religious distortion owing to the neglect of God's
word and believing Satan's lies (Matt. 22:29; Mark 12:24; John 8:44).
   "The truth of God is found in His word. Those who feel that they
must seek elsewhere for present truth need to be converted anew.
They have wrong habits to mend, evil ways to be abandoned. They
need to seek anew the truth as it is in Jesus, that their character build-
ing may be in harmony with the lessons of Christ."—Testimonies for
the Church, vol. 8, p. 192.
   In last week's lesson, we studied how to become new persons in
Christ. This week, we will learn how to validate our faith and hope and
affirm our convictions in the "everlasting gospel" (Rev. 14:6).

AN ETERNAL GOSPEL (Rev. 14:6; Gal. 1:7-9; 2 Cor. 11:3-5).

  In today's world, people suffer from drastic changes and instability.
How crucial, then, is the everlasting and reliable gospel of Christ!

   Based on what you read in Galatians 1:7-9, what one word best
describes the nature of Christ's gospel? (This word does not nec-
essarily have to come from the text given.)


   The world is constantly changing. The newest computer software
on the market today will be obsolete tomorrow. With or without a
reason, people conclude that we must have change. Such a conclusion
often means that people even desire to change God's teachings.

   But what does Scripture say about this?

   Heb. 13:8

   Heb. 9:22

   1 Pet. 1:25

  Think of at least two ways people have tried to change the
Bible, God's method of salvation, and even God Himself:

     The Bible     God's Method of Salvation          God Himself




  "Let not erroneous theories receive countenance from the people
who ought to be standing firm on the platform of eternal truth. God
calls upon us to hold firmly to the fundamental principles that are
based upon unquestionable authority."—Testimonies for the Church,
vol. 8, p. 298.
   "[Satan] causes men and women to doubt God's love and seeks to
deprive them of the power to choose the right. He occupies their
minds with anything and everything that will crowd out time, and the
desire, for Christ, for His righteousness, and for His kingdom (Luke
21:34-36)."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 909.

    What has been occupying your mind lately? How can you
 clean out the clutter to make room for Christ?

                                                                     23

A MESSAGE NOT OF HUMAN INVENTION (2 Pet. 1:16; 1 Cor.
2:13).

   What kind of gospel did Peter and Paul teach to their listeners?
2 Pet. 1:16; 1 Cor. 2:13.

    There were some "Christians" at the time Peter wrote his second
letter who no longer believed in the Second Coming. But Peter claims
the right to preach this divine truth because of what he saw on the
Mount of Transfiguration (Matt. 17:1-5).
    Both Peter and Paul were moved by the Spirit to preach God's
truth. They taught and wrote about ideas that were not their own.
   "The gospel will be revealed as a living power and not as cunningly
devised fables or idle speculations. It will be revealed as a reality, not
the result of imagination or enthusiasm. This will be of more conse-
quence than sermons or professions or creeds."—Testimonies for the
Church, vol. 6, p. 264.

   What two things should we do with the divine message? 1 Cor.
9:16; James 1:22-24.

     1.

     2.


   "Christianity does not help people live their everyday lives." So
said one woman who practices a Far Eastern form of religion. Yet
according to James 1:22, this is exactly what Christianity was meant
to do. It is not enough to read the Bible or sit in a pew on Sabbath and
listen to a sermon. The essence of Christianity involves letting what
we have studied and heard influence our lifestyles and habits. The
powerful gospel transforms people and leads them to reflect the char-
acter of Christ.
   "If Christians were to act in concert, moving forward as one, under
the direction of one Power, for the accomplishment of one purpose,
they would move the world."—Christian Service, p. 75.

  What is the most important contribution you believe the divine
gospel has made to your daily life? Be ready to explain why to
your Sabbath School class.

   How can you share with a friend, a neighbor, or a colleague
this week the difference the gospel has made in your life?

ONLY ONE (Eph. 4:3-6; 2 Cor. 13:8; Titus 2:11-14).

  In what seven areas is the church to achieve a special unity?
Eph. 4:3-6.

   1.                                4.

   2.                                5.

   3.                                6.

                    7.

   "The apostles and early Christians considered Christ's return 'the
blessed hope.' . . . They expected all the prophecies and promises of
Scripture to be fulfilled at the Second Advent .. . for it is the very goal
of the Christian pilgrimage. All who love Christ look forward eagerly
to the day when they will be able to share face-to-face fellowship with
Him—and with the Father, the Holy Spirit, and the angels."—Seventh-
day Adventists Believe . . . , p. 334.

   Explain what happens when people try to have more than one
Lord. Matt. 6:24; Gal. 1:10. How is worrying similar to trying to
serve two masters? Matt. 6:25-34.

   Have you ever tried to think of several things at a time? Do several
things at once? Or focus your eyes on two different objects at the same
time? How much success did you have? Trying to serve God while
clinging to a favored opinion or prejudice is just as big a failure. He
cannot be just one influence among many. He must be our one regard
in all aspects of life in order for us to live His life.
   " 'Mammon' is a Chaldean word for the money-god. It is a word
which speaks of the systems of materialism which are so very domi-
nant in human experience. The disciple is to give undivided loyalty to
the Master; mammon is to take a very inferior place.
   "Jesus is not teaching a withdrawal from the material world. Rather,
He calls for a decision which is necessary for His disciples to live
freely in the world."—Myron S. Augsburger, The Communicator's
Commentary: Matthew, Lloyd J. Ogilvie, ed. (Word Books: Waco,
Texas, 1982), pp. 92, 93.

    How can hope in Christ's return lead to a transformed life and a
 transformed church? Explain how focusing on the "blessed hope"
 can prevent us from serving two masters and help us to live freely.

                                                                        25

THE SUSTAINER OF OUR HOPE (Rom. 5:1, 2; Col. 1:27).

   The secular person has worldly dreams and can develop some hope
for a better future. But all these expectations often will end in bitter
frustration. More and more the people of our generation recognize
human impotence when it comes to building a better world.
   But as we learned in yesterday's lesson, as God's children we have
the "blessed hope" (Titus 2:13) of Christ's return. We are not adrift.
We know where we are going! When life is full of distress, the Second
Coming gives us hope. "Find rest, 0 my soul, in God alone; my hope
comes from him. He alone is my rock and my salvation; he is my
fortress, I will not be shaken" (Ps. 62:5, 6, NIV).
   "Feelings are not a safe criterion. We are not to look within for
evidence of our acceptance with God. We shall find there nothing but
that which will discourage us. Our only hope is in 'looking unto
Jesus.'. . . There is everything in Him to inspire with hope, with faith,
and with courage. He is our righteousness, our consolation and rejoic-
ing."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, pp. 199, 200.

  Explain the relationship between grace and hope. Rom. 5:2,
KJV.


   Grace and hope bring joy to our faith. We live both by faith and by
hope. One secures the other. Ask yourself: Does the advent hope bring
joy and certainty to my life? If not, why not? Decide that no matter
what others may do or say, you shall not lose faith in the God who
sustains your hope.

     Explain how Christ in us is the "hope of glory." Col. 1:27.


   When the Lord abides in us, His transforming power renews our
inner life, and a new vision regarding the future enlightens all our
being. Christ becomes the glorious hope that improves our present and
secures our eternal future.
   "All the way up the steep path leading to eternal life are well-
springs of joy to refresh the weary. The true, strong joy of the soul
begins when Christ is formed within, the hope of glory."—Selected
Messages, book 2, p. 169.

   How has the "blessed hope" sustained your courage and faith
in the hour of trial? Be prepared to share one such experience
with your Sabbath School class.

"I KNOW WHOM I HAVE BELIEVED" (2 Tim. 1:12; James 1:2-
12).

   Of what is Paul convinced? 2 Tim. 1:12.


   Notice that Paul did not say in what he believed, but in whom he
believed. His certainty came not from a creed or a theology, but from a
personal experience with His Savior. That is why, after doing the
work God had asked him to do, he could entrust the results to Him.
Paul did not have any doubt about his faith and his Lord. Doubt can
produce spiritual weakness and inconsistency. But faith in God brings
power to the soul, conviction to the mind, and holiness to the Christian
life.
    "Faith is trusting in God—believing that He loves us, and knows
what is for our best good. Thus, instead of our own way, it leads us to
choose His way. In place of our ignorance, it accepts His wisdom; in
place of our weakness, His strength; in place of our sinfulness, His
righteousness."—Gospel Workers, p. 259.
    One day, while visiting a well-known Christian author, a young
man asked: "Are all the books you've written the foundation of your
faith?"
    The writer answered as he pointed to various books in his library:
"These six volumes are my first work on faith. But after the death of
my son, I wrote these four volumes on the subject. Then after yet
another severe trial, I wrote these two."
    Next the writer took down a small book and said: "This is my very
last book. But when my wife passed away, I understood that faith is
simply to trust in God."
    "He will have no fear of bad news; his heart is steadfast, trusting in
the Lord" (Ps. 112:7, NIV).

  What counsel do we find in James 1:2-12 regarding stability,
perseverance, and growth in faith and hope?


   "Perplexities will increase; but let us, as believers in God, encourage
one another. Let us not lower the standard, but keep it lifted high, look-
ing to Him who is the Author and Finisher of our faith."—Selected
Messages, book 2, p. 406.

    According to your observations, what things are most likely
 to weaken a person's Christian convictions?
    How often do you feed your faith and hope with the study of
 God's Word? What difference does this make?

                                                                       27

FURTHER STUDY: Use a concordance to look up the words faith and
hope. After reading a few of the verses you find, analyze the relation-
ship between the two.
   Read The Great Controversy, pp. 608-612; Last Day Events, chap.
2; Selected Messages, book 2, chaps. 6, 50.

   "God's people are not to be in confusion, lacking order and har-
mony, consistency and beauty. The Lord is greatly dishonored when
disunion exists among His people. Truth is a unit. The unity that God
requires must be cultivated day by day if we would answer the prayer
of Christ. The disunion that is striving for existence among those who
profess to believe the last message of mercy to be given to the world,
must find no place; for it would be a fearful hindrance to the advance-
ment of God's work. His servants are to be one, as Christ is one with
the Father; their powers, illuminated, inspired, and sanctified, must
be united to make a complete whole. Those who love God and keep
His commandments are not to draw apart; they are to press together."
—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8, pp. 174, 175.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. After studying this week's lesson, make a list of items that
     answer the Key Question in Sabbath's lesson. One answer
     is provided for you: We can build a united church whose
     members share one faith and one hope by adopting a sin-
     cere and humble attitude, without preconceptions or preju-
     dices, when we do not understand a particular Bible pas-
     sage.

     2. Do we need to modernize the essence of the gospel in order
        to make it more agreeable to the secular world? What about
        methods of presenting the gospel? Explain your answers.

     3. Discuss the spiritual benefits of belonging to the family of
        God, with the same faith and hope, in contrast to the confu-
        sion and alienation we find in this world.

SUMMARY: We are God's family with the same faith and hope. We
are called to keep and preach only biblical truths free from any
favored opinions and prejudices. This way, we can be "united in love
and action," as we shall study in the next week's lesson.

                 I Was Blind, But Now I See
                         As told to B. Wiafe

    My name is Mtalimanja Njobvu. I am quite old, though I do not
know when I was born. I live in a farming village in the South
Luangwa game reserve in Zambia. My wife died several years
ago, and my 10 children have grown and moved into town.
    One day I noticed that my eyesight was growing dim. Soon it
became impossible to hunt and work on my farm. Without any
family members nearby to help me, I lived by the mercy of kind
neighbors.
    During the dry season, some health workers from Kamoto
Hospital came to my village. They examined my eyes and told me
that if I did not get help, I would lose the little bit of sight I still
had in my right eye. I did not take them seriously at the time, but a
few months later I realized that the vision in my right eye was
growing dimmer.
    My only hope was to get to the hospital at Kamoto, a four-day
walk from my village. But I was old and nearly blind. I did not
know how long it would take me to get there. Maybe I could not
even make it, but I decided to try.
    I asked my neighbors to take care of my hut, in which were
stored all my earthly belongings. I put on my best attire and started
for Kamo10. My journey took me through the game reserve, where
I heard the elephants, birds, and monkeys. But I could not see them.
    Sometimes I missed the path and had to turn back to find it
again. At night I slept in villages along the way. Some of the
people I talked to encouraged me to go on, and others told me to
go home. But I had made up my mind to press on.
    On the ninth day I finally reached Kamoto only to learn that the
doctor was away. I was so disappointed! But the people there were
wonderful; they took me to Mwami Hospital in Chipata by ambu-
lance! That was my first ride in a vehicle in 25 years.
    The doctors in the hospital at Mwami operated on my eyes.
Within 10 days I was given a pair of glasses to wear. Behold! Now
 I can see with the eyes of a young man! I can hunt and farm, and I
do not have to rely on my neighbors to feed me. Thank you for
helping me receive my sight again.

   Dr. B. Wiafe is the medical director and chief ophthalmologist of the
Mwami Adventist Hospital in Chipata, Zambia. He performed the
surgery on Mr. Njobvu's eyes.

                  United in Love
                  and in Action




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Eph. 5:2; John 13:34, 35;
Matt. 22:37-40; John 17:26; 21:15-17; Col. 3:12-14.

     MEMORY VERSE: "My little children, let us not love in word
     or in tongue, but in deed and in truth" (1 John 3:18, NKJV).

   KEY QUESTIONS: What is Christian love? Why is it the highest
of all Christian virtues? As God's children, how can we cultivate this
virtue? How does Christ's love help us to live in the world but not be
of the world?

   "IN DEED AND IN TRUTH." Think about the many evils, afflic-
tions, and disgraces that exist in our world and in the church because
people do not understand or care about Christian love. Then think
about the disunity and coldness that occur as a result.
   Christian love does not consist only of words. It should be mani-
fested "in deed and in truth" (1 John 3:18).
   "Love cannot live without action, and every act increases, strength-
ens, and extends it. Love will gain the victory when argument and
authority are powerless."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2, p. 135.
   "Unless we daily cultivate the precious plant of love we are in
danger of becoming narrow, unsympathetic, bigoted, and critical,
esteeming ourselves righteous when we are far from being approved
of God."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 605.
   This week, learn how Christ's love can motivate and inform Christ's
family and reaffirm its position and commission in the world.

"WALK IN LOVE" (Eph. 5:1, 2; John 13:34, 35; 15:12; Phil. 2:1-3).

  Explain what it means to "walk in love." Eph. 5:1, 2.


   How will people who are not Christians know we are true fol-
lowers of Christ? John 13:34, 35. Compare this text with Ephesians
5:1, 2.


   People are watching to see whether we treat one another with
kindness. If they do not see that the spirit of service and forgiveness
motivates our behavior toward each other, we will disappoint them,
and they will view us as hypocrites. If, however, they see that we truly
emulate Christ's love within the church family, they will recognize
that we are truly His disciples.

   Analyze the connection between love and humility in Philippians
2:1-3.


   "Attitudes of selfishness, pride, self-confidence, self-sufficiency,
superiority, prejudice, criticism, denunciation, and faultfinding among
believers contribute to disunity in the church. Often a loss of the first
love in the Christian experience lies behind these attitudes. A fresh
look at God's gift in Christ at Calvary can renew love for one another
(1 John 4:9-11)."—Seventh-day Adventists Believe . . . , pp. 178, 179.
   "Christian love is that unconquered goodwill which never knows
bitterness and never seeks anything but the good of others. It is not a
mere reaction of the heart, as human love is; it is a victory of the will,
achieved by the help of Jesus Christ. It does not mean loving only
those who love us; or those whom we like; or those who are lovable. It
means an unconquerable good-will, even to those who hate us, to
those whom we do not like, to those who are unlovely. This is the very
essence of the Christian life; and it affects us in time and in eternity."
—William Barclay, The Letters to the Philippians, Colossians, and
Thessalonians (Philadelphia: The Westminster Press, 1975), p. 33.

    Take a hard look at your local congregation. How has it
 succeeded in displaying Christian love? How has it failed? How
 can it improve? In what ways have you contributed to the suc-
 cesses or failures? How can you contribute to any improvements
 that might be necessary?



                                                                       31

THE PERFECT LAW OF LOVE (John 15:9, 10; Matt. 22:37-40).

   Many people view Seventh-day Adventists as legalistic simply
because we emphasize the permanence of the Ten Commandments
and the need to obey them. Furthermore, some church members present
the mistaken concept that the law is the key to salvation rather than
Christ. But nothing could be farther from truth. Let us reaffirm now
that He is our only Savior (Eph. 2:8, 9; 5:23; 1 Pet. 1:18, 19).

   How does John 14:15 and John 15:9, 10 help us understand
1 John 3:18?


   All of us know someone who professes love for another, yet then
does whatever she or he pleases regardless of the pain or conse-
quences it may cause the beloved. But according to Christ, love is
shown only through obedience—"in deed and in truth."
   An impossibility? Yes, if we depend upon our own strength. But
immediately after His command in John 14:15, Christ says, "'And I
will pray the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may
abide with you forever"' (v. 16, NKJV). The meaning of the word we
translate as Helper is "one called to the side of." There the Holy Spirit
is willing to stay forever, guiding and directing us along the path to
victory. Christ's love inward flows in action outward.

  In your own words, how does Matthew 22:37-40 summarize the
Decalogue? Explain the meaning of " 'with all your heart, and
with all your soul and with all your mind' " (v. 37, NIV). What
does it mean to " 'love your neighbor as yourself' "? (v. 39).


   "How little do we enter into sympathy with Christ on that which
should be the strongest bond of union between us and Him--compas-
sion for depraved, guilty, sufering souls, dead in trespasses and sins!
The inhumanity of man toward man is our greatest sin. Many think
that they are representing the justice of God while they wholly fail of
representing His tenderness and His great love. Often the ones whom
they meet with sternness and severity are under the stress of tempta-
tion. Satan is wrestling with these souls, and harsh, unsympathetic
words discourage them and cause them to fall prey to the tempter's
power."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 163, italics supplied.

  What does 1 John 2:3-5 say about those who confess Him but
do not keep His commandments? What does it say to you?

CONTROLLED BY CHRIST'S LOVE (2 Cor. 5:14; John 21:15-17).

   What does it mean to be controlled, ruled, or constrained by the
love of Christ? 2 Cor. 5:14.


   This verse places Christian love far above a mere feeling. Christ's
love is a power, a force that elevates our thoughts, modifies our
attitudes, and transforms our whole life. It is God's life injected into
our inner life, then revealed in our behavior.
    How much stronger our spiritual life would be if Christ's love con-
trolled us! Are we praying for this? Lord, give us the power of Your
love and Your Spirit.

   Why do you think Jesus asked Peter the same question three
times? John 21:15-17.


   What did He mean by the command "Feed my sheep"?


   Jesus hoped that Christian love would motivate His disciples to
take care of His flock. True love is always active, useful, practical, and
dynamic. It is a way to serve others while at the same time edifying
and uniting the church.
   "Knowledge, benevolence, eloquence, gratitude, and zeal are all
aids in the good work; but without the love of Jesus in the heart, the
work of the Christian minister is a failure."—The Desire of Ages,
p. 815.

   The fountain of love. The story is told of a missionary translator
who could not seem to find in a particular African dialect a word that
corresponded to love. He sensed he could not translate the story of
God's love for the people without such a word. After he had talked to
many people about it, a man who was standing with his small daughter
said, "Yes, there is a word. Ok'efe means 'I care for this little girl so
much, that when I think of what is going to befall her when she grows
up, it hurts me.' " That is what God's love for us is like. He loves us so
deeply that it is hard for us to comprehend it. How can such a measure
of love fail to inspire us to love God and our neighbor?

SINCERE LOVE (Col. 3:12-14; 1 Cor. 4:20, 21).

  What does Paul say about the loving attitude we should have as
God's chosen ones? Col. 3:12-14.


   We feel faulty before this teaching, because we recognize how far
we are from such an ideal. But we can be "conquerors through Him
who loved us" (Rom. 8:37). We can ask ourselves, "Who is sufficient
for these things?" (2 Cor. 2:16). The answer is, "Not that we are
sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves; but our
sufficiency is of God" (2 Cor. 3:5).
   "If our hearts are softened and subdued by the grace of Christ, and
glowing with a sense of God's goodness and love, there will be a
natural outflow of love, sympathy, and tenderness to others."—Testi-
monies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 606.
   "If we possess the humility of our Master, we shall rise above the
slights, the rebuffs, the annoyances, to which we are daily exposed,
and they will cease to cast a gloom over the spirit."—The Desire of
Ages, p. 301.


  What contrast does Paul point out in 1 Corinthians 4:20, 21?
Explain how love can equal power.


    To talk about love, to condemn others because they do not have
love, and to pretend that we have love when we really do not—these
are all easy to do. But Christian excellence does not consist in words,
no matter how beautiful they might be. The core of Christ's gospel "is
not a matter of words" (1 Cor. 4:20, TEV) but a matter of what we are.
It is what people see in us, not what they hear us say. While words can
inform, they also can deceive. Only our behavior can convince an-
other person that we are faithful.
    We must be careful, however, that the love we display to any one
particular individual does not blind that person to his or her faults.
Christian love must at times come in the form of discipline, just as
God found it necessary to at times discipline His people. " 'For the
Lord disciplines those whom he loves, and chastises every child whom
he accepts"' (Heb. 12:5, 6, NRSV).

   When John and Darla's son, Jeff, went to get his learner's
permit to drive a car, the officer smelled alcohol on his breath.
As Christians who want to emulate their Savior's love toward
their children, what should Jeff's parents do to discipline him?

JESUS' DESIRE FOR US (John 17:26; Rom. 13:8-10).

  According to Jesus' prayer, what measure of love should we
have? John 17:26.


   It is impossible for us to comprehend the fathomless depths of
God's love for His Son. Nevertheless, Jesus declares that He wants us
to have such love! In divine love there is unity, harmony, and con-
certed action to spread the gospel. When we are "knit together in love"
(Col. 2:2), we are able better to understand "the mystery of God, both
of the Father and of Christ" (NKJV). In contemplating this love, we
are drawn nearer to Christ and become filled with Him.

   How does Paul express the goodness of love and its relationship
to God's law? Rom. 13:8-10.


   Have you ever thought of Christian love as a debt we owe each
other? Yet in verse 8, this is exactly how Paul describes it. Just how do
we pay that debt? How is love the fulfillment of the law? Love never
seeks what it can get, only what it can give. Therefore, we will not
steal. Love is selfless, not selfish. Therefore, we will not covet our
friends' and neighbor's spouses. Love does not seek to destroy. There-
fore, we will not commit murder or bear false witness. And so it goes.
If we honestly seek to pay this debt of love, we will want to obey
God's law. Thus there is no contradiction between love and law. On
the contrary, the love that leads to obedience brings us joy, helps with
our difficulties, and secures church unity.
   "Greater attention should be given to the subject of unity. What is
the recipe for the cure of the leprosy of strife and dissension? Obedi-
ence to the commandments of God."—Selected Messages, book 2,
pp. 159, 160.

   Why should love be the impelling motive of all our actions?
(1 Cor. 16:14). How do your daily attitudes harmonize with this
principle of love? When somebody says something wrong or nega-
tive about you, what is your natural reaction? How would you
react if Christ's love motivated your thoughts and actions? Read
Matthew 5:44-48.


   "Do you feel that it is too great a sacrifice to yield all to Christ?
 Ask yourself the question, 'What has Christ given for me?' "
 —Steps to Christ, p. 45.

FURTHER STUDY: As you read 1 Corinthians 13, use it as a mirror
to analyze the real motives and feelings of your heart.
   Also read Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, pp. 167-177; 341-
348; The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 548-552.

   "Read this chapter [1 Corinthians 13] every day, and from it obtain
comfort and strength. Learn from it the value that God places on
sanctified, heaven-born love, and let the lesson that it teaches come
home to your hearts. Learn that Christlike love is of heavenly birth,
and that without it all other qualifications are worthless."—Ellen G.
White, Review and Herald, July 21, 1904.
   "The exercise of force is contrary to the principles of God's gov-
ernment; He desires only the service of love; and love cannot be
commanded; it cannot be won by force or authority. Only by love is
love awakened. To know God is to love Him; His character must be
manifested in contrast to the character of Satan."—The Desire of
Ages, p. 22.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. After studying this week's lesson, how would you answer
     the Key Questions in Sabbath's lesson?

     2. How can we love or accept others as they are, even though
        they may be wrong in their thinking and attitudes?

     3. How can we increase our Christian love toward one another?
        Make a list of at least four ways. One is given for you here:
        We can increase our Christian love for one another by
        doing things that are for the benefit of someone else.

     4. More than anything else, genuine love can bring healing and
        restoration. Exert a special effort today to manifest His love
        to a hurting person.

     5. Contrast the blessings we receive through Christian love
        with the consequences of the heart's natural selfishness.

SUMMARY: God wants to have a united church on this earth. Jesus
prayed for the unity of His disciples, which includes each one of us. It
is through love that we can "dwell together in unity" (Ps. 133:1). But
it must be an active and sincere love, "in deed and in truth" (1 John
3:18).

                        The Peacemaker
                            J. H. Zachary

    Theology students at Mountain View College in the Philippines
serve as student pastors in local churches. Jerry Fernandez was
assigned to a large church near the campus. Although the church
had four hundred members, it was not growing.
    As Thirteenth Sabbath approached, Jerry prepared for the Com-
munion service. He learned that two of the local elders were in-
volved in a dispute over a strip of land that lay between their farms.
The disagreement had become heated, and one man called the other
a liar and a thief. The second man stopped attending church. How
could he worship with the man who had attacked him?
     Jerry felt that he had to visit the men. But he was barely twenty
years old, and the two men were in their sixties. Jeny knew that he
needed the help of the Holy Spirit in order to reconcile these brothers.
    Jerry visited the first elder and counseled him to surrender the
disputed land to his neighbor and to wash his brother's feet on
Sabbath. Finally the elder agreed. "Jesus will be waiting for you at
church," Jerry promised.
    Then Jerry visited the second man and made a similar appeal.
But the man resisted, "He called me a liar and a thief! He should
make this right first." Jerry gently pleaded with the man to forgive
his brother and come to the Communion service. "Jesus wants you
to come," Jerry said. But the man would not promise.
    On Sabbath morning Jerry hiked the three miles to his church.
He found the first elder waiting for him. But as time for church
neared, Jerry became concerned. The second elder had not come.
    Jerry borrowed a bicycle and rode to the home of the second
elder. "Brother," he pleaded, "we are waiting for you. Today is the
 day to make things right." The older man repeated his reasons for
not coming, but Jerry kindly persisted. "The Lord Jesus will be
 disappointed if you do not come."
    Finally the elder agreed. The man got on the bicycle, and Jerry
 pedaled back to the church. When they arrived, Jerry took the two
 men into the banana patch behind the church. While the two men
 faced each other, Jerry took their hands and prayed for them.
    The reconciliation sparked a revival in the church, and soon the
 church was crowded with worshipers. The congregation built a
 larger church around the old building. The membership continues
 to grow, in part because of a peacemaking young pastor.
  J. H. Zachary is international evangelism coordinator for The Quiet
Hour, located in Redlands, California.

          An Open Community




Sabbath Afternoon

READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Mark 7:24-30; Luke 10:30-
33; John 4:7-15; Acts 17:26; Rom. 10:5-11; James 2:1-9.

     MEMORY TEXT: "If you really fulfill the royal law according
     to the Scripture, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself,' you
     do well; but if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are
     convicted by the law as transgressors" (James 2:8, 9, NKJV).

   KEY QUESTIONS: What should our attitude, as Christians, be
toward nonbelievers and people who belong to other religious groups
and classes? How should we look upon those people whom we find
most disagreeable and unpleasant?

   WITH PREJUDICE TOWARD NONE. Last week we studied
about the importance of Christian love in the church and home and its
influence over the unity of both. This week we will study Christian
love in relationship to all people, no matter who they might be.
   "Christ recognized no distinction of nationality or rank or creed. . . .
Christ came to break down every wall of partition. He came to show
that His gift of mercy and love is as unconfined as the air, the light, or
the showers of rain that refresh the earth."—Selected Messages, book
2, p. 485.
   The only way for us to have a loving heart, free from prejudice and
discriminative attitudes, is through the indwelling Holy Spirit. He
empowers us to emulate Christ's example in relating to and reaching
out to others all around us.

THE SPIRIT OF JESUS (Mark 10:45; John 13:15-17; Matt. 7:12).

 What kind of spirit did Jesus manifest while He was on earth?
Mark 10:45; John 13:15-17.


   "It is not the length of time we labor but our willingness and
fidelity in the work that makes it acceptable to God. In all our service
a full surrender of self is demanded. The smallest duty done in sincer-
ity and self-forgetfulness is more pleasing to God than the greatest
work when marred with self-seeking."—Christ 's Object Lessons,
p. 402.
    The story is told about a church that was destroyed during the heat
of a mighty battle. Workers clearing the rubble found a statue of
Christ with the hands missing. When a famous sculptor offered to
restore the hands, the church officers declined, saying that the statue
of a handless Christ had become to them a symbol of the Lord's use
of the hands of His followers to serve Him through loving deeds for
others.
   Yes, the Lord uses our hands to serve others; our lips to preach to
others; our feet to reach others; and our warm hearts to revive the
sinner's cold heart.
    Serving means to do something good for others. But it also secures
our joy in the Lord. Albert Schweitzer (1875-1965), the well-known
physician and philanthropist who served in Gabon, Africa, once told a
group of students: "I do not know which will be the destiny of each
one of you; but one thing I know—the only ones among you who will
be really happy will be those who have sought and found the way to
serve."

   Explain the golden rule in your own words. Matt. 7:12.


   There is no greater principle regarding human relations than these
simple yet profound words of Christ. But how easy they are to under-
stand without putting them into practice.
   "The standard of the golden rule is the true standard of Christianity;
anything short of it is a deception."—Thoughts From the Mount of
Blessing, pp. 136, 137.

     What have you done lately for someone that required a sacri-
 fice of time, money, or some other commodity you have little of?
 If it has been a while, how can you be Christ's hands, feet, lips,
 and heart today?


                                                                      39

WITHOUT PARTIALITY (Acts 10:34, 35; Rom. 2:5-11).

    What do the following verses say about God's attitude toward
all peoples? Acts 10:1-35; Rom. 2:5-11. What is our attitude toward
the different peoples of the world in view of His?


   When it comes to relations with people, the word partiality means
"respect of persons;" that is, "to make a difference in the treatment
given from one person to another," or to respect one and disrespect
another. That was the valuable lesson God taught Peter through the
vision He gave him. There is no distinction between people and their
need for salvation. Christ died for all people, and He paid for each one
with the same precious price, His blood. He has no preference for one
above another. He loves all, no matter how low they may have fallen.
Because of His impartial grace, we may all be encircled by His wel-
coming and reconciling arms.
    "Christ came to this earth with a message of mercy and forgive-
ness. He laid the foundation for a religion by which Jew and Gentile,
black and white, free and bond, are linked together in one common
brotherhood, recognized as equal in the sight of God. The Saviour has
a boundless love for every human being."— Testimonies for the Church,
vol. 7, p. 225.

     How does James illustrate the sin of partiality? James 2:1-9.


   The early church was at first composed largely of humble, common
people. Therefore, when rich people did attend or join, it must have
seemed logical to the members to treat them with great favor. But the
early church also was the only institution at that time that did not
recognize pre-existing social distinctions. Here slaves and masters
could be seen sitting together. Or perhaps the slave was even leading
out. But as it is in the arms of God, so He intends for it to be among
His family members.

  Are you conscious that partiality is a sin? What damage can it
do? Where does it exist in the church today? In your local congre-
gation? In your own life?


   If you believe partiality exists in any one of these areas, where
should you start to eradicate it, and why? Pray that our impar-
tial God will open your heart and arms to all of His children as
they cross your path.

JESUS' EXAMPLE (John 4:7-39; Luke 10:25-33; Mark 7:24-30).

   Today we will study three cases in which Jesus manifested a spe-
cial consideration to people who were not Hebrews. First, read each
case from the Bible. Then read the lesson comments regarding the
case. Finally, answer the following questions for each case: What was
the nature of the service rendered? What was the outcome? What do
the answers to these two questions teach me in general about serving
people who do not share my beliefs and lifestyle?
    First case: John 4:7-15. "The Jews and the Samaritans were bitter
enemies, and as far as possible avoided all dealing with each other."
—The Desire of Ages, p. 183. Nevertheless, Jesus talked to the woman
by the well. Their memorable conversation brought salvation not only
to her but others in the nearby city.
    "The Saviour is still carrying forward the same work as when He
proffered the water of life to the woman of Samaria. Those who call
themselves His followers may despise and shun the outcast ones; but
no circumstance of birth or nationality, no condition of life, can turn
away His love from the children of men."—The Desire of Ages, p. 194.
    Second case: Luke 10:25-33. The Samaritan "did not question
whether the stranger was a Jew or a Gentile. If a Jew, the Samaritan
well knew that, were their condition reversed, the man would spit in
his face, and pass him by with contempt. But he did not hesitate on
account of this."—The Desire of Ages, p. 503.
    In telling this story, Jesus showed consideration for a traditional
 enemy of the Jews. He exalted the behavior of the one who had com-
 passion in his heart.
    Third case: Mark 7:24-30. Jesus performed this miracle for one
 reason. Yes, He had compassion for the girl with an unclean spirit. But
 He also had in mind another purpose.
     "He wished to relieve the afflicted woman, and at the same time to
 leave an example in His work of mercy toward one of a despised
 people for the benefit of His disciples when He should no longer be
 with them. He wished to lead them from their Jewish exclusiveness to
 be interested in working for others besides their own people."—The
 Desire of Ages, p. 402.

   Examine your own life honestly. Do you find yourself helping
only those who are in your church or who think and act like your-
self? If so, what can you begin doing to remedy this situation?


   How does reaching others not of our persuasion help to fulfill
 Christ's command as given to us in Matthew 28:19, 20?


                                                                     41

THE EXPERIENCE OF ISRAEL (Luke 13:34, 35; Matt. 21:33-43).

    God had chosen Israel to be His ambassadors to a lost world.
Through them, people everywhere were to hear about God's plan of
redemption. Their dependence on and worship of God would be the
lesson book from which other nations could learn about the Creator
and Redeemer.
    But Israel lost its dependence on God and its sense of mission.
They viewed themselves with a proud exclusivism. God had told
them, "Arise, shine; for your light has come! and the glory of the Lord
is risen upon you" (Isa. 60:1, NKJV). But they "loved darkness rather
than light" (John 3:19). So they ceased to be God's chosen people,
because they rejected "the true Light which gives light to every man
who comes into the world" (John 1:9).

   What words of condemnation did Jesus pronounce upon Jerusa-
lem? Luke 13:34, 35; Matt. 23:33-43.


   "Jesus wept in anguish over the doomed city, but He could not
deliver her. He had exhausted every resource. In rejecting the warn-
ings of God's Spirit, Israel had rejected the only means of help. There
was no other power by which they could be delivered."—The Desire
of Ages, p. 587.
   And so God called the church to do the work that Israel refused.
With a new vision, Jesus' followers were to take the gospel to all the
world. It is still our vision today.
   "Christ commissioned His disciples to proclaim a faith and worship
that would have in it nothing of caste or country, a faith that would be
adapted to all peoples, all nations, all classes of men."—The Desire of
Ages, p. 819.
    "For this work the church was established, and all who take upon
themselves its sacred vows are thereby pledged to be co-workers with
Christ."—The Desire of Ages, p. 819.
   Truly ours is a global mission. Gary Krause, Global Mission com-
munications director of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, states,
"Global Mission . . . confronts us with the unreached millions. It pulls
our focus onto the 'dangerous' unknown—outside our areas of com-
fort. For most of us it's the danger of trying something new, sacrific-
ing precious time, or giving more than we've budgeted."—Adventist
Review, August 1997, p. 15.

    What special aspects of the gospel are we as Seventh-day
 Adventists called to share with the world? Think of two or three
 things you can start doing in your part of the world.

"MADE FROM ONE BLOOD EVERY NATION" (Acts 17:26; Rom.
10:12).

  Analyze Paul's statement concerning the equality of individual
members within the human family. Acts 17:26.


   During Paul's time, there was a strong division of classes. Because
rich people believed they were a superior class, there was a deep
separation between one class and the other. But after so many centu-
ries, the same problem still prevails. Fortunately, "no distinction on
account of nationality, race, or caste, is recognized by God. He is the
Maker of all mankind. All men are of one family by creation, and all
are one through redemption."—Selected Messages, book 2, p. 486.
   "Without distinction of age, or rank, or nationality, or religious
privilege, all are invited to come unto Him and live. 'Whosoever
believeth on Him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference'
(Rom. 10:11-13)."—The Desire of Ages, p. 403.

   How does Romans 10:12 explain why the Christian faith does
not maintain a class distinction? Consider the significance of the
word whoever in the context of Romans 10:13, and then compare
it with John 3:16.


   All this week, we have been studying the need to have open minds
in order to overcome our prejudices so that we might treat our neigh-
bors with Christian love. As Christians, we always should remember
that God loves each of us the same. Jesus died for all, even for the
supposedly insignificant and miserable. What a boundless love!
   Moreover, we are called to follow Christ's example. What does the
Decalogue say about loving our neighbor? (Matt. 22:39; Rom. 13:8-
10). What is the teaching of the golden rule? (Matt. 7:12). Is it
possible for a Christian to get enough spiritual strength to practice this
noble behavior? Human selfishness is so big, the secular influence is
so subtle, and our tendency to excuse our personal indifference is so
common that only through the Holy Spirit can we follow Christ's
example.

    Contemplate this promise in Philippians 4:13, "I can do all
 things through Christ who strengthens me" (NKJV). How does
 believing in this promise encourage and empower us to love as
 Christ loves? Share with the class how God helps you "through
 Christ" to do the seemingly undoable?


                                                                       43

FURTHER STUDY: What does Matthew 25:31-46 teach us about
loving others, regardless of their situation in life?
   Read The Desire of Ages, chapters 19, 43, 54. Also read Appendix
3 of Selected Messages, book 2. This material offers practical advice
on preaching the gospel to the whole world, without distinguishing
between countries, races, classes, cultures, or tongues.

    "No question of policy influenced His [Jesus'] movements. He made
no difference between neighbors and strangers, friends and enemies.
That which appealed to His heart was a soul thirsting for the waters of
life. . . .
     "He sought to inspire with hope the roughest and most unpromis-
ing, setting before them the assurance that they might become blame-
less and harmless, attaining such a character as would make them
manifest as the children of God. . . .
   "[People] longed to become worthy of His confidence. . . . New
impulses were awakened, and to these outcasts of society there opened
the possibility of a new life."—The Ministry of Healing, pp. 25, 26.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. After studying this week's lesson, how would you answer
     the Key Questions in Sabbath's lesson?

     2. The religion of Christ calls us to serve others. Why is it so
        difficult to develop a spirit of service? In what practical
        ways can the Holy Spirit help you apply Christ's example of
        not being served, but serving others? (See Mark 10:45.)

     3. How can we keep the church an open, loving community?
        Discuss at least five ways. One is given here to get you
        started: Having programs of Christian service for the com-
        munity in which your congregation resides.

     4. Contrast the blessings of impartial Christian love with the
        negative features of prejudice.

SUMMARY: As a church and as individual members, we should keep
in mind (1) our global mission to reach all nations and (2) Christ's
example of treating everybody with the same understanding and con-
sideration.

                         Coming Home
                   Beverly Herbrandson Koester

   Chinsisi of Malawi is the eldest in a family of nine brothers. It
was Chinsisi's influence that inspired his next-younger brother,
Yami, to become a Christian. But during his later teen years
Chinsisi dropped out of school before he graduated. His church
attendance became sporadic, and he began smoking and drinking.
   When his parents died in 1993, Chinsisi turned even more to
drinking to help him forget the troubles at home and the needs of
his younger brothers.
   That left Yami, 18 and just out of high school, to take on the
role of parent to his brothers. Yami found a job and began support-
ing his brothers. Chinsisi, ashamed of the problems he was caus-
ing the family, left town.
    For the next three years Yami struggled to support and nurture
his brothers. He taught them to love Jesus, and he trusted in the
Lord to do for them what Yami could not do. During this time
Yami never forgot his older brother.
    When the young adults in his church in Blantyre called for a
day of fasting and prayer on behalf of one of their members who
was facing Sabbath problems at work, Yami joined in. The young
people sang and prayed. But as the Holy Spirit moved upon their
hearts, they began sharing and praying for one another's burdens
as well. As members of the group expressed personal needs,
others in the group prayed for them by name.
    During this time of sharing, Yami told the group of his burden
for his brother Chinsisi, who had been the spiritual influence that
had brought him to Christ. He related how Chinsisi had drifted
from the Lord and from his family. He asked his friends to pray
that Chinsisi would come home. Yami was comforted as his friends
took his burden to God.
    A few months later, during Christmas, Chinsisi returned to
Blantyre and was reunited with his joyful brothers. During the
 long conversations that followed, Yami learned that within two
weeks of the day of fasting and prayer, Chinsisi had given up
 smoking and drinking. He quit his job and began attending church.
    Chinsisi had come home.

   Beverly Herbrandson Koester and her husband recently returned
from Malawi, where they had served as missionaries for eight years. She
works at the General Conference.

            United in Diversity




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Rom. 12:4-8; 1 Cor. 12;
Eph. 4:1-3, 11-16; John 17:17-23.

     MEMORY TEXT: " 'I do not pray for these alone, but also for
     those who will believe in Me through their word; that they all
     may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they
     also may be one in Us, that the world may believe that You sent
     Me' " (John 17:20, 21, NKJV).

   KEY QUESTIONS: There are millions of Seventh-day Adventists
in many parts of the world. They worship God in places such as Chad,
Russia, Sweden, Canada, Mexico, India, Australia, China, Peru, and
Namibia. How can such a diverse group of people maintain unity as a
worldwide church family? What does unity do for the church?

   CALLED TO BE UNITED. Last week we saw the need to be an
open church, without discrimination toward anyone. Such an attitude
of love and impartiality enables us to fulfill our global mission (Matt.
28:19, 20). This week we shall consider how unity in the church also
helps us do to so. We must remember, however, that when Jesus
prayed for the disciples to be one in Him and with one another (John
17:21), He also prayed for their sanctification in the truth of His word
(v. 17).
   "Union is strength; division is weakness. When those who believe
present truth are united, they exert a telling influence."—Testimonies
for the Church, vol. 5, p. 236.

Sunday                                                October 31
MANY MEMBERS, ONE BODY (Rom. 12:4-8; 1 Cor. 12:12-27).

  An analogy compares two items to show how they are similar.
What analogy does Paul use in Romans 12:4-8 and 1 Corinthians
12:12-27 to help us understand the concept of unity within the
church?


   Paul's comparison teaches us the following about unity:
    1. The church needs all of its members. We are not to act in
isolation, but in concert with one another.
   2. The work of each member is important. Try having a church
without Sabbath School leaders or teachers. Without deacons or dea-
conesses. Without elders or a pastor. How could your church function
without hostesses or hosts? It does not matter whether you sweep the
floors, change the light bulbs, preach the sermon, teach a class, or set
up tables for fellowship dinners. Whatever you do is vital to the unity
of the church.
    3. God gives each of us a gift to use on behalf of His church family.
Because of this, people do not need to be jealous of a gift they do not
have. The gift God has given us may not be a highly visible one, but it
is nevertheless a useful one, and we are to use it cheerfully and
willingly.

   What other things about church unity does Paul's comparison
teach us? Plan to share one or two ideas with your Sabbath School
class. Provide specific verses from Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians
12 to support your ideas.


   "Union with Christ and with one another is our only safety in these
last days. Let us not make it possible for Satan to point to our church
members, saying: 'Behold how these people, standing under the ban-
ner of Christ, hate one another. We have nothing to fear from them
while they spend more strength fighting one another than in warfare
with my forces.' "—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8, p. 240.

   All bodily functions depend upon the head. Who is the head of
the church? Eph. 4:15. What difference does it make?


   "May have the preeminence" (Col. 1:18, NKJV) is rendered as
"might have the first place" (TEV) and "be in all things alone su-
preme" (NEB). When Christ has first place in our lives, there will be
unity in the church.

                                                                       47
Monday                                              November 1
ONE IN CHRIST (Gal. 3:28; 2 Cor. 13:11; Eph. 4:1-3).

  Explain the key that enables us to prevent or to heal disunity
among Christ's disciples. Gal. 3:28.


    Since all virtue in the church is the result of the Christian's new
life, we all should be daily born again in order to build church unity in
Christ.
    "We should seek for true goodness rather than greatness. Those
who possess the mind of Christ will have humble views of themselves.
They will labor for the purity and prosperity of the church, and be
ready to sacrifice their own interests and desires rather than to cause
dissension among their brethren."—Testimonies for the Church, vol.
5, p. 242.

   How do you understand the admonition to "be of one mind"?
2 Cor. 13:11 (NIV). Does it mean that we all must think and act
alike? Why, or why not?


  "Have the same feeling;" "agree with one another; live in har-
mony;" "think in the same direction." These are some other good
expressions to say what Paul had in mind in his last letter to the
Corinthians.

   What relationship exists between being "of one mind" and the
rest of Paul's counsel in 2 Corinthians 13:11?


   "Strive earnestly for unity. Pray for it, work for it. It will bring
spiritual health, elevation of thought, nobility of character, heavenly-
mindedness, enabling you to overcome selfishness and evil-surmising,
and to be more than conquerors through Him that loved you and gave
Himself for you."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 188.

   Church unity was a priority of Paul's. In his letter to the
Ephesians he writes again on this topic, this time in connection
with other Christian virtues. List and comment on each of these
virtues. Eph. 4:1-3.


   "Divisions in the church dishonor the religion of Christ be-
fore the world. . . . What are we doing to preserve unity? . ."
—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 239.

Tuesday                                            November 2
SPIRITUAL GIFTS FOR UNITY (1 Cor. 12:4-6, 28-31; Eph. 4:11-
16; Rom. 12:4-8).

  Explain how unity can function harmoniously in diversity. 1 Cor.
12:4-6; Rom. 12:4-8.


   Spiritual gifts are different in each member of Christ's body accord-
ing to God's will. But His power can perform the miracle of unity in
making such gifts complementary and unifying to serve His ideals and
purposes.
   "The vine has many branches, but though all the branches are
different, they do not quarrel. In diversity there is unity. All the
branches obtain their nourishment from one source. This is an illustra-
tion of the unity that is to exist among Christ's followers. In their
different lines of work they all have but one Head. The same Spirit, in
different ways, works through them. There is harmonious action,
though the gifts differ. Study this chapter [1 Corinthians 12]. You will
see from it that the man who is truly united with Christ will never act
as though he were a complete whole in himself."—Ellen G. White
Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1090.

   What goals should we have in mind as we use our spiritual
gifts? Eph. 4:11-13. How do the goals relate to each other?

   1.


   2.


   3.

   The word translated "equipping" (NKJV), "perfecting" (KJV), or
"to prepare" (NIV) is used in Matthew 4:21 in relationship to mending
nets, and in Galatians 6:1 in relationship to restoring a person who
succumbs to a fault. Thus, the spiritual gifts "were for the purpose of
`mending' the saints and uniting them. The 'perfecting' involves, as
the context suggests, an ordered ministry and government of the
church."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1023.

    Consider your spiritual gift(s) or something you know you do
 well. Think of at least two ways you can use that ability accord-
 ing to each of the goals Paul outlined in Ephesians 4:12, 13. Then
 with God's help, fulfill one of those goals this week.

                                                                      49

"NO DIVISIONS AMONG YOU" (1 Cor. 1:10, NIV; Rom. 15:5, 6).

   Again and again Paul wrote about unity. He wanted to be sure his
readers understood the importance of this subject. How can the church
be strong if its members are divided, are jealous of one another, have
selfish ambitions, or fight one against the other? (Mark 3:24, 25).

     What does Paul plead for in 1 Corinthians 1:10?


   Paul's pleading is a result of a report that there was strife within the
Corinthian church (v. 11). Based on verse 12, this strife must have
involved different members of the church supporting or following one
teacher or another. Thus the Corinthians focused on human teachers
instead of Christ the Master Teacher. The result? Disunity. Then they
needed to relearn that "Christ is the center to which all should be
attracted; for the nearer we approach the center, the closer we shall
come together in feeling, in sympathy, in love, growing into the
character and image of Jesus."—Selected Messages, book 1, p. 259.
   Plutarch, a Greek historian of the first century, tells how Scilurus,
on his deathbed, gave a bundle of darts to each of his children and told
them to try to break the darts as a unit within the bundle. When none
of the children could do so, he separately withdrew each dart and
easily broke them all one by one. Thus he taught them that if they held
together they would remain strong. But if they became divided, they
would be weak.

   What does Paul mean when he says we should be "like-minded
toward one another, according to Christ Jesus" (Rom. 15:5, NKJV)?


   "Paul is not praying for identity of opinion on inconsequential
matters, but for a spirit of unity and harmony, in spite of differences of
opinion. Mere unity or unanimity is not what Paul desires for his
fellow Christians, but a spirit of unity patterned after the perfect
model of whose whole purpose was to do . . . the will of Him who sent
Him (John 6:38)"—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, pp. 643, 644.
   Christ is our model of such unity. He desired not to do His will, but
the will of the Father who sent Him (John 6:38). If this were truly the
goal of each church-family member, unity would prevail.

    Over what issues is your church divided? What could be done
 corporately to bring about unity? What could you do as an
 individual to help unite the church?

Thursday                                          November 4
UNITY REVEALS THAT GOD SENT THE SON (John 17:12, 20-
23).

  Jesus wanted the world to know that the Father had sent Him.
He wished for people to accept Him as God's Son, the Messiah and
Christ (John 17:3). In order for this to happen, what picture must
Christ's followers present to the world? John 17:20-23.


    We find the model for Christian unity in the perfect oneness that
exists between the Father and the Son (John 17:21). We should also
note that we may be one in Them. Jesus' prayer places unity in its
proper perspective: first we must each be united with God. Then, as a
result, we will be united as a church family. (This is exactly as it is
with the Ten Commandments. The first four stress our relationship
with God. When our relationship is as it should be, then our relation-
ships with others—the last six commandments—will be as they should
be.)
    Our personal union with Christ and unity among the believers are
still the best evidence that He was sent by the Father.
    "Let each one who claims to follow Christ esteem himself less and
others more. Press together, press together. . . .
    "Let everyone seek to answer the prayer of Christ: 'That they all
may be one; as Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee.' "—Testimonies
for the Church, vol. 5, pp. 488, 489.
    "The disunion that is striving for existence among those who pro-
fess to believe the last message of mercy to be given to the world,
must find no place; for it would be a fearful hindrance to the advance-
ment of God's work."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8, pp. 174,
175.

  What attitudes should we cultivate that will in turn cultivate
Christian unity? Phil. 2:1-5. Examine yourself before these atti-
tudes as if they were a mirror.

    When Jesus prayed His famous prayer in John 17, He prayed
 for each one of us. How will you be a part of the answer?

                                                                     51
Friday                                               November 5
FURTHER STUDY: Read Psalm 133. How do David's analogies in
this Psalm help us to understand the blessings of church unity?
   Read Selected Messages, book 3, chap. 2; Testimonies for the
Church, vol. 4, chap. "Unity of the Church"; vol. 5, chap. "Christian
Unity."

   "The testimony of every believer in the truth must be as one. All
your little differences, which arouse the combative spirit among brethren,
are devices of Satan to divert minds from the great and fearful issue
before us. The true peace will come among God's people when through
united zeal and earnest prayer the false peace that exists to a large
degree is disturbed. Now there is earnest work to do. Now is the time
to manifest your soldierly qualities; let the Lord's people present a
united front to the foes of God and truth and righteousness."--Selected
Messages, book 3, p. 20.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. After studying this week's lesson, how would you answer the
     Key Questions in Sabbath's lesson?

     2. What personal benefits have you received as a result of the
        spirit of unity within your church or Sabbath School class?

     3. Paul compared church unity to the human body. What other
        comparisons could you use to explain church unity?

     4. How can we help to maintain unity within the church?
        Think of at least six ways. Try to support the various ways
        with a Bible text. One is given here: Focus on the positive
        features of the church instead of the negative (Phil. 2:3, 4;
        4:8).

     5. Contrast the blessings of being a member of a united church
        with the division and discord of the secular world.

SUMMARY: To have a united church despite the diversity that exists
in it is a miracle of God. This miracle is possible only when Christ
dwells in our hearts. Only then can we (1) be one in Christ, (2) build
church unity, (3) use our spiritual gifts for God's glory, and (4) grow
as a church, revealing to all that the Father sent His Son to save us.

                   The Power of Influence
                            J. H. Zachary

    Mori Emeri and her husband owned a dance hall and beer
parlor next door to their home in Papua New Guinea. Then Mori
met Jesus and accepted Him as her personal Lord and Savior.
    She rejoiced in her new life as a Christian and was determined
to live for Christ. But her former lifestyle was making it difficult,
and the dance hall and beer parlor were their only source of
income.
    Mori knew that her young children were being influenced by
the people who frequented their establishment next door. She
pleaded with her husband to find different work. What would
become of their children as they grew up with this bad influence?
What future would they have?
    Although her husband is not a Christian, he agreed to try to find
work in Port Moresby. While he was gone, Mori tore down the
dance hall and built a bush church from woven bamboo walls and
a grass roof.
    With tender love she decorated the church. She arranged the
backless benches, placed a clean decorated cloth over the table at
the front, and placed jungle flowers on the front walls. The simple
building was an inviting and lovely place to worship God.
    Mori's decision to follow Christ has made a large impact on her
community. Instead of the noises of dancing and carousing, songs
of praise fill the air. The neighbors appreciate having the church in
 their neighborhood instead of the dance hall that attracted less-
 than-desirable patrons. And Mori's children now live in a more
 peaceful environment, where she can teach them to love the Sav-
 ior as she does.
    Attendance at the new church is growing as Mori Emeri visits
                            her neighbors and shares with them the
                            joy she has found in serving the Lord
                            Jesus. But her most earnest prayer is that
                            her husband will find the same joy, the
                            same new life, that she has found in Jesus.

            In the World but Not
                 of the World




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Phil. 3:17-19; John 17:14-16;
2 Tim. 3:1-5; 1 John 2:15-17; Gal. 5:18-25.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Do not love the world or the things in the
     world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in
     him" (1 John 2:15, NKJV).

   KEY QUESTIONS: How is it possible for Christians to live in
the world without being of the world? How does Christ's life inform
our answer?

   SIN IS GROWING EVERYWHERE. Listen to the evening news
on television or radio, or read the newspaper to see how sin is corrupt-
ing the human heart in every corner of the world. We will not find any
place without the stain of iniquity.
   But we do not need the media to convince us of Satan's work in the
degradation of this world. Paul wrote, "All have sinned and fall short
of the glory of God" (Rom. 3:23, NKJV). Ellen White penned these
words, "I was shown the state of the world, that it is fast filling up its
cup of iniquity. Violence and crime of every description are filling our
world, and Satan is using every means to make crime and debasing
vice popular."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3, p. 471.
   This week's lesson will highlight the stark contrast between the
church and the world, holiness and sin, between God's children and
people under Satan's dominion. May the Lord help us to be always on
the right side of these contrasts.

MINDS SET ON EARTHLY THINGS (Phil. 3:17-21: 1 John 4:1-3).

   How does Paul contrast the end of those who are faithful dis-
ciples of Christ with the end of those who are not? Phil. 3:17-21.


   The apostle is referring to professed followers of Christ, whose
behavior contradicted the truth in which they claimed to believe. They
called themselves Christians, but they had set their minds on the sinful
things of this earth. Examining today's world, we discover the same
kind of nominal religion and moral degradation that existed in Paul's
days. The evil one is intensifying his deceitful work. Through the
secular mind he leads people by the millions to profanity, hedonism,
materialism, and spiritual indifference. Or he wins many others through
spiritualism, paganism, and New Age philosophies.

   Since there are so many mistaken beliefs, what wise advice does
John give us? 1 John 4:1-3. What is the significance of the phrase
"in the flesh"?
   How subtle are Satan's efforts to deceive and destroy us? 2 Cor.
11:14.

   "The experience of the past will be repeated. In the future, Satan's
superstitions will assume new forms. Errors will be presented in a
pleasing and flattering manner. False theories, clothed with garments
of light, will be presented to God's people. Thus Satan will try to
deceive, if possible, the very elect. Most seducing influences will be
exerted; minds will be hypnotized."—Testimonies for the Church,
vol. 8, p. 293.
   In John 17:14-16, Jesus prays, not that the Father will remove His
small band of disciples from the world, but that His Father will keep
them from the evil in the world. He never meant for His followers to
withdraw from this life, but to face it triumphantly with Him by their
side. The religion of Christ, if rightly practiced, equips us with those
things necessary to meet the world straight on. "Finally, be strong in
the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God so that
you can take your stand against the devil's schemes. For our struggle
is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the
authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the
spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms" (Eph. 6:10-12, NIV).

     How have you seen error presented in a pleasing and flatter-
 ing manner within the past few months? How did you recognize
 it for what it was? How did you deal with it?

"PERILOUS TIMES" (2 Tim. 3:1-5, NKJV; Phil. 2:14-16).

   Read 2 Timothy 3:1-5. Then list the sins he mentions in the fol-
lowing categories. Be able to explain why you placed them where
you did.

     Sins against God



     Sins against humankind



     Weaknesses of character



   Verse 5. The people described in 2 Timothy 3:1-5 "are not people
who make no profession of religion, or who repudiate religion. Nomi-
nally they are religious folk, holding the form of religion but deny-
ing the power of it. They go through the practices which are associ-
ated with religion but neither experience nor expect to experience any
transforming power."—The Interpreter's Bible, vol. 11, p. 499.

  Contrast the description Paul gives of God's true children in
Philippians 2:14-16 with his description in 2 Timothy 3:1-5.


   Here we find one of the greatest contrasts in Scripture. In the midst
of spiritual darkness we can "shine as lights." We can speak the truth
amidst deception. We can practice integrity amidst corruption. We can
obey God amidst rebellion. We can fill our hearts with Jesus' presence
amidst the emptiness of the world.
   "The glory of this light, which is the very glory of the character
of Christ, is to be manifested in the individual Christian, in the family,
in the church, in the ministry of the word, and in every institution
established by God's people."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6,
p. 11.

  Both 2 Timothy 3:1-5 and Philippians 2:14-16 are mirrors in
which we can see ourselves. What strikes you the most when
you compare or contrast yourself to these two descriptions? Ask
God to fill your heart with Jesus' presence so, gazing into the
mirror, you will see only Him.

THE SIN OF IMITATION (1 Sam. 8:4-9; 1 Cor. 2:12; James 4:4).

   What did the Israelites ask the prophet Samuel to do? 1 Sam.
8:4-9.


    God's people wanted to be "like all the nations." Falling into the
sin of imitation, they got just what they asked for. They turned from
God. They failed in their mission. They became scattered. They almost
lost their own identity as a nation. Finally, they lost their privileged
position as God's people. In summary, they became like the heathen
nations around them.
   "The days of Israel's greatest prosperity had been those in which
they acknowledged Jehovah as their King—when the laws and the
government which He had established were regarded as superior to
those of all other nations."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 605.
   "But they, disregarding this high honor, eagerly desired to imitate
the example of the heathen! And still the longing to conform to worldly
practices and customs exists among the professed people of God."
—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 607.
   No matter how attractive a worldly lifestyle might be, the tragedy is
always the same. To buy the world, one must "sell" God. The result?
An empty, weary life, ending with eternal loss.

   What contrasts appear in the following verses to help us under-
stand the dangers of imitating the world?

   1 Cor. 2:12


   2 Cor. 6:14-18


   James 4:4

   Adulterers and adulteresses. In many places, the Old Testament
compares the relationship God has with His people to marriage (see
Isa. 54:5; Jer. 3:14, 20; the book of Hosea). Therefore, to be unfaithful
to God, to have an intimate relationship with the world, is to commit
spiritual adultery. Just as physical adultery breaks the heart of the
innocent spouse, so a person's spiritual adultery breaks the heart of
God.

    What parts of a worldly lifestyle tempt you to commit the "sin
 of imitation"? How can you imitate Christ instead?

                                                                      59

PURITY AMID IMPURITY (1 John 2:15-17; John 1:43-46).

   The world is God's creation. And Jesus constantly presented
His message using illustrations from nature. So what does 1 John
2:15-17 mean when it advises us not to love the world? Define the
following:

     Lust of the Flesh      Lust of the Eyes        Pride of Life




   Here the apostle John points out the need to have clean thoughts
and pure motives. The carnal mind and coveting eyes, along with "the
pride of life," are common sins in the world. But, as God's children,
we should reject them. Otherwise they will corrupt our lives.
   "Choose poverty, reproach, separation from friends, or any suffer-
ing rather than to defile the soul with sin. Death before dishonor or the
transgression of God's law should be the motto of every Christian."
—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 147.

  What example does Joseph give us regarding such a choice?
Gen. 39:9. Read the whole story in the chapter. Who is the
greatest example of purity? John 1:43-46.


   Christ grew up in Nazareth, a small town known for its sinfulness.
This explains why Nathaniel exclaimed, "Can anything good come
out of Nazareth?" The fact is that, as a child, youth, and adult, Jesus
"was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin" (Heb. 4:15).
He left us an example, that we should follow His steps (1 Pet. 2:21).
  "Jesus was placed where His character would be tested. It was
necessary for Him to be constantly on guard in order to preserve His
purity. He was subject to all the conflicts which we have to meet, that
He might be an example to us in childhood, youth, and manhood."
  The Desire of Ages, p. 71.

     We live in a sinful world. But we do not need to be a part of
 its impurity and degradation (Eph. 5:11). The key to victory is in
 Jesus and His two-part formula in Matthew 26:41. How can you
 apply this formula to your life today?

THE DIRECTION OF THE SPIRIT (Gal. 5:18-25; 2 Chron. 7:14).

  Read Galatians 5:18-25. Then fill out the chart below. As you
do so, analyze one by one the virtues in the second column, and
vow to have the Holy Spirit develop them in you.

       Works of the Flesh                Fruit of the Spirit




   "When a man is converted to God, a new moral state is supplied, a
new motive power is given, and he loves the things that God loves; for
his life is bound up by the golden chain of the immutable promises to
the life of Jesus."—Selected Messages, book 1, p. 336.

  What divine promise made to Solomon and his people can God's
people of today claim? 2 Chron. 7:14. List and explain the four
conditions of this promise.


   Those who obstinately disobey God are not prepared to receive the
guidance of the Spirit. But the humble soul who wants to do God's
will discovers that the Spirit of God works in the believer's soul,
enabling him to advance from one line of obedience to another, reach-
ing on from strength to greater strength, from grace to grace in Jesus
Christ.
   A young man approached a holy man of India sitting on the bank of
the Ganges River and asked him how he could find God. The guru
responded, "When you want God as much as a drowning man wants
air, you will find Him."

   When was the last time you followed the progression in
2 Chronicles 7:14? Is there something in your life you could
 improve by meeting these conditions?

                                                                    61

FURTHER READING: Read Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3, pp.
471-482. These pages will help you to understand your spiritual need
and the way to overcome sin.

   The great thought of William Shakespeare in his work Hamlet was,
"To be or not to be. That is the question." We could paraphrase these
words saying, "To be or not to be a Christian." "To be a good son or
daughter of God, or to be of this world." Every day we decide what we
want to be, and we reap accordingly (Gal. 6:7). The Lord tells us with
love through Moses, "Choose life" (Deut. 30:19).

   "We must not, as a people, become careless and look upon sin with
indifference. The camp needs purging. All who name the name of
Christ need to watch and pray and guard the avenues of the soul; for
Satan is at work to corrupt and destroy if the least advantage is given
him."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3, p. 476.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  I. After having studied the lesson of this week, are we willing
     to walk with Jesus and to be faithful to Him? Are we always
     conscious that we only live in this world but we are not of
     it?

     2. By the way we behave, are we revealing that our love is for
        Christ and not for the things of the world?

     3. How can we live in the world but not be of the world? One
        answer is to reject all forms of sin and depend on God
        (James 4:7).

     4. Contrast the world that surrounds us with the blessings of
        living in purity and friendship with Christ.

SUMMARY: According to Jesus' prayer, His desire is not to take us
out of the world but to keep us from the evil one (John 17:15). Sin is
everywhere, and it is growing. We don't need to imitate the world.
Instead, we are called to be pure amid impurity, through the ministry
of God's Holy Spirit.

                 A Single Act of Kindness
                        Zoravko Stefanovic

    Rina Videnia needed help. She and her brother were visiting
Singapore, and her visa would soon expire. She did not know
where to go to get it extended.
    By chance Rina met Mabel Ngui, who took her to the embassy
to extend her visa. Rina was grateful to Mabel and wanted to
thank her. So when Mabel invited Rina to attend a Bible study at
the home of a friend, Rina accepted. She was an active member of
her church in the Philippines, and she enjoyed Bible study. Since
she could remain in Singapore longer, she agreed to attend the
Bible study again with her new friend.
    At the Bible studies, Rina met other church members and Mabel's
pastor as well. The pastor visited Rina and her brother several
times during their stay in Singapore.
    When Rina returned to the Philippines, she told her family about
the Bible studies she had attended with the Adventists. She wanted
to worship with Adventists in the Philippines, but she did not
know where an Adventist church or Bible study group met. Soon
she was back in her busy life of teaching, medicine, and working
in her own church.
    Then one day she discovered the Adventist church on the
campus of the International Institute of Advanced Studies, the
Adventist theological school near Manila. She began attending
and once again enjoyed deep Bible study.
    Word reached her pastor that Rina was attending the Adventist
 church on Sabbaths. He did not want to lose her from the congre-
 gation and tried to involve her even further in church activities.
 But Rina recognized God's truths and made her decision to be-
 come a Seventh-day Adventist. Soon her husband and children
 joined her in the Adventist church. Then a Bible study group was
 organized in Rina's home as well.
    Today, as her entire family worships together in the Adventist
 Church, Rina thanks God for the simple act of kindness from a
 Christian woman in a distant country, for that kind act led Rina
 and her family to a more complete knowledge of Bible truth.

International Institute of Advanced Studies in the Philippines.

     "Zealous for Good Works"




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Titus 2:11-14; 3:8; Eph. 2:8-
10; 5:25-27; 1 Thess. 5:23; 1 Pet. 1:13-16; Rom. 6:12-14.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Looking for the blessed hope and glorious
     appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ, who gave
     Himself for us, that He might redeem us from every lawless
     deed and purify for Himself His own special people, zealous for
     good works" (Titus 2:13, 14, NKJV).

   KEY QUESTIONS: What is the relationship between our faith in
God and our behavior? Why is it necessary for the church to be a group
of holy people?

   CHRIST, THE SECRET OF A NEW LIFE. There is a world-
wide tendency to think that it is possible to change or to behave in a
righteous manner through mere human effort. But the more we trust in
ourselves, the more we deceive ourselves. Let us consider the follow-
ing statement regarding this subject:
   "In this season of conflict and trial we need all the support and
consolation we can derive from righteous principles, from fixed reli-
gious convictions, from the abiding assurance of the love of Christ, and
from a rich experience in divine things."—Testimonies for the Church,
vol. 5, p. 105.
   This week we will study holiness as the practical demonstration of
our faith. We also will see that the external aspects of our religion are
the result of our connection with God (James 2:14-26).

CREATED FOR GOOD WORKS (Titus 2:7, 11-14; 3:8; Eph. 2:8-
10).

    Paul wrote to Titus while Titus was working with the Christians
who lived on Crete, a large island in the Mediterranean Sea. During the
early years of Christianity, the citizens of Crete were known for their
dishonesty and other sins (Titus 1:10-12). Therefore, Paul considered
it necessary to write to Titus about "good works," that is, Christian
behavior as the visible result of faith in God and His transforming
power.

  According to Paul's letter to Titus, what is one of the reasons
Christ redeemed us? Titus 2:14. What should we "be careful to
maintain"? Titus 3:8.


   If we would take into account the moral condition of today's world,
we would agree that Paul's words to Titus are appropriate for us also.
Titus 2:8, 14 are clear enough to help us understand the relationship that
exists between faith and behavior (or daily deeds). The NEB renders
the text of Titus 2:14 this way: "Make us a pure people marked out for
his [Christ's] own, eager to do good" (italics supplied).

  Explain why being "created in Christ Jesus for good works"
does not contradict being saved by grace through faith in Christ
(Eph. 2:8-10).


   Notice the preposition for used in our text: We become new crea-
tures in Christ for good works not by good works. "We do not earn
salvation by our obedience; for salvation is the free gift of God, to be
received by faith. But obedience is the fruit of faith. . . . If we abide in
Christ, if the love of God dwells in us, our feelings, our thoughts, our
purposes, our actions, will be in harmony with the will of God as
expressed in the precepts of His holy law."—Steps to Christ, p. 61.

    What did Paul mean by a pattern of good works in Titus 2:7?
 Think about your behavior yesterday in regard to the following:
 (1) your co-workers, (2) your family, (3) your friends, (4) the
 cashier at the checkout counter, (5) the family pet, (6) an ongo-
 ing, troublesome situation. Ask yourself, What did my behavior
 in any one of these areas say about my faith in God? What is the
 only way to change my behavior in an area where it might be
 wanting?


                                                                         65

A CHURCH WITHOUT WRINKLE (Eph. 5:25-27; 1 Tim. 3:15).

     Explain what Jesus did for His church and why. Eph. 5:25-27.


   From the very beginning of the human race, God wanted to have a
holy people. But sin produced great frustration. Even though there
was no earthly antidote, God had an effective cure already prepared.
His only Son, Jesus Christ, giving His life for the justification and
sanctification of all repentant sinners. Through the offering of His life,
Christ cleansed and sanctified His church, making it holy and without
blemish.

  What are you doing, as a member of Christ's body, to keep holy
and pure the beloved church for which Jesus gave His life? How
can the church be holy if its members are not holy? Explain your
answer.


  How does Paul refer to the church in 1 Timothy 3:15? What
does this tell us about one of the church's functions?


   Our text in the RSV refers to the church as "the pillar and bulwark
of the truth." The NIV refers to it as "the pillar and foundation of the
truth." These translations reveal one of the most outstanding functions
of Christ's church. It must sustain and preserve God's truth amidst the
false teachings of our day. If the church were not holy, how could it
fulfill such a sacred commitment? Our slogan should be "Holiness to
the Lord" (see Exod. 39:30) instead of "Faithfulness to the world"!
   What has just been said about the church in general must be applied
to every one of its members. Christ calls each one of His professed
disciples to be a "pillar," "support," "bulwark," or custodian of the
truth, not only through words of defense but through deeds of ex-
ample.
    "I lift my voice of warning to all who name the name of Christ to
depart from all iniquity. Purify your souls by obeying the truth. Cleanse
yourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holi-
ness in the fear of God."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3, p. 475.

    What types of thought occupied your mind the most yester-
 day? Were they thoughts motivated by the love of Christ as
 displayed in the price He paid for the holiness of His church and
 each of its members? How does His love motivate you?

OUR SANCTIFICATION (1 Thess. 4:3; 5:14-23; 2 Cor. 7:1).

   How does Paul define sanctification, or holiness? 1 Thess. 4:3.


   We can grow in holiness through prayer and reading the Bible. We
can maintain holiness by developing a humble spirit and a pure mind.
We can express our holiness by doing something good for others. But
the only way to live in holiness consists in doing God's will.
   "Excitement is not sanctification. Entire conformity to the will of
our Father which is in heaven is alone sanctification, and the will of
God is expressed in His holy law. The keeping of all the command-
ments of God is sanctification."—Selected Messages, bk. 3, p. 204.
   "Holiness . . . is an entire surrender of the will to God. . . . It is . . .
trusting God in trial, in darkness as well as in the light; it is walking by
faith and not by sight; it is relying on God with unquestioning confi-
dence, and resting in His love."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 51.

   What parts of our life does God sanctify? 1 Thess. 5:23.


   After mentioning various aspects of true Christianity in verses 14-
22, the apostle Paul tells us in verse 23 how we can reproduce these
aspects in our own lives. "The God of peace" is our Sanctifier through
Jesus, "the author and finisher of our faith" (Heb. 12:2).

   Look upon Jesus. The Duke of Milan commissioned Leonardo da
Vinci to paint "The Last Supper." Da Vinci worked for several years
on what would become a masterpiece, paying attention to every detail
of the disciples' faces, the grouping around the Lord's table, the
chalice, and, of course, the face of Jesus. Finally, da Vinci was ready
to share his labor with a friend. As the friend marveled at the beautiful
work of art, he exclaimed, "Oh, what a beautiful chalice! I cannot take
my eyes off it."
   Upon hearing those words, da Vinci immediately took his brush
and painted through the chalice, exclaiming in return that nothing ever
should divert one's eyes from Christ!

    Consider your interests and concerns. How might they be
 diverting your "eyes" from Christ? Are you as willing to "paint"
 through them as da Vinci was to paint through his beautiful
 chalice? Our lives can be compared to an empty canvas on
 which a self-portrait is painted. When Christ enters into the
 heart, how can His love turn even the most broken soul into a
 "masterpiece"?

                                                                            67

"BE HOLY, BECAUSE I AM HOLY" (John 17:17; 1 Pet. 1:13-16,
NIV).

   After our conversion, with all its spiritual changes, what are we
called to be? 1 Pet. 1:13-16 (compare Lev. 11:44, 45).


   God's call has not changed during the centuries. What a loving
Father we have! He places before us the highest ideal of conduct, then
helps us to reach it (Phil. 2:13).
   "Higher than the highest human thought can reach is God's ideal
for His children. Godliness—godlikeness—is the goal to be reached."
—Education, p. 18.
   "We shall attain to the full stature of men and women in Christ
Jesus only as the result of a steady growth in grace."—Testimonies for
the Church, vol. 5, p. 105.

   Read Hebrews 12:14. Why will no one see the Lord without
being holy?


   No one will be saved practicing sin. Our lives must be "hidden with
Christ in God" so that His Holy Spirit will be able to work His good
will through us (Col. 3:3, NIV). Then our names will be "written in
the Lamb's book of life" (Rev. 21:27).

   Read John 17:17. Explain the relationship between sanctifica-
tion and God's Word dwelling in our hearts.


   "The prayer of Christ was, 'Sanctify them through thy truth: thy
word is truth.' Therefore the sanctification of the Spirit of God upon
the heart, leads men to walk in the way of God's commandments. The
very test that God brought upon Adam in Eden, will be brought upon
every member of the human family. Obedience to God was required of
Adam, and we stand in the same position that he did to have a second
trial, to see whether we will listen to the voice of Satan and disobey
God, or to the Word of God and obey."—Ellen G. White Comments,
SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, pp. 1146, 1147.

   Matthew 25:31-46 basically states that we will be judged
(measured) by how we have treated one another. Read this
passage. Then explain why the above quotation is not a contra-
diction of these verses. Are we meant to understand the thirst,
hunger, loneliness, and nakedness literally, as symbols, or both?

CONSECRATION TO GOD (Rom. 6:12-14; 1 Cor. 15:58; Josh. 3:5).

   Why will sin no longer dominate the lives of sincere and genu-
ine Christians? Rom. 6:12-14. How would you explain to someone
that verse 14 does not mean we do not have to obey God's law?


   Sin is our worst enemy. If we tolerate it in our lives, or if we hide it
in our hearts, as Achan hid the spoils of Jericho in his tent (Josh. 7:19-
21), sooner or later disaster will strike (James 1:15).

   By God's grace and the Holy Spirit's work within us, we can be
sanctified. Apply 2 Corinthians 3:17 to this concept of spiritual
liberty.


   The opposite of sin is obedience, loyalty, faithfulness, integrity,
consecration, holiness, and communion with God. All heaven is ready
to help us live such a life. Do we always remember this? If so, we shall
be able to "overcome evil with good" instead of being "overcome by
evil" (Rom. 12:21, NRSV). The children of Israel were faithful to God
only for short periods of time. Their periods of repentance from
spiritual adultery were like "morning cloud[s]" and "the early dew"
(Hosea 6:4, NRSV). How would you rate your fidelity to the Lord? By
God's grace, is it firm and constant? "My beloved brethren, be stead-
fast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord" (1 Cor.
15:58, NRSV). Pray that it may be so!
   "If you will only watch, continually watch unto prayer, if you will
do everything as if you were in the immediate presence of God, you
will be saved from yielding to temptation, and may hope to be kept
pure, spotless, and undefiled till the last."—Testimonies for the Church,
 vol. 5, p. 148.

   Why did Joshua tell the Israelites to sanctify themselves? Josh.
3:5.


   We are about to cross the spiritual Jordan into heaven—our
 promised kingdom of God. As God commanded the Israelites,
 He commands us also to become sanctified through grace. What
 wonders will He do among us who surrender our lives fully to
 Him? In preparing to be in His presence in heaven, are we
 experiencing His presence here? We will walk with Him there if
 we, like Enoch, walk with Him here.

sages, bk. 1, chap. 60; Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, pp. 19-29.

   A trapeze performer was explaining how he executed a breath-
taking triple somersault: "To catch the swing," he explained, "you
must time your dive perfectly. It takes a lot of practice and courage.
The secret is to throw your heart over the bar. And when you do that,
your body will follow." In the same manner, when we give our heart
to Christ, our whole life will follow (Prov. 23:26).

    "He [Jesus] is not only the author but the finisher of our faith. It is
Christ first and last and always. He is to be with us, not only at the
beginning and the end of our course, but at every step of the way.
David says, 'I have set the Lord always before me: because he is at my
right hand, I shall not be moved.' . . .
    "Consecrate yourself to God in the morning; make this your very
first work. Let your prayer be, 'Take me, 0 Lord, as wholly Thine. I
lay all my plans at Thy feet. Use me today in Thy service. Abide with
me, and let all my work be wrought in Thee.' This is a daily matter.
Each morning consecrate yourself to God for that day. . . . Thus day by
day you may be giving your life into the hands of God, and thus your
life will be molded more and more after the life of Christ."—Steps to
Christ, pp. 69, 70.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. The Lord calls us to be holy, "zealous for good works."
     Explain how this is possible.

     2. List a number of ways a person can resist the degrading
        influence of today's society.

     3. After studying this week's lesson, how would you answer
        the Key Questions in Sabbath's lesson?

     4. Contrast the blessings of living a holy life through Jesus
        with the life of those who live without Him.

SUMMARY: As God's children, we have the honor of being holy by
virtue of the Holy Spirit. As a result, we will be able to do "good
works." It is clear that the Sanctifier, the One who makes us holy, is
the Lord (1 Thess. 5:23) through our faith and our consecration to
Him.

                 The Priest Changed Gods
                           J. H. Zachary

   "Lamungia is a pagan village with about 200 people," Pastor
Punda explained as the taxi in which we rode struggled along a
rough trail in this remote section of Orissa State in India. Nor-
mally the pastor walks from the highway to the village, a journey
that takes him all day.
   We arrived in the village and stepped inside the humble mud-
brick home of Dinabandha Pradhan, a former pagan priest. His
wife was preparing a meal over an open fire in the smoke-filled
room.
   For most of his adult life Pradhan had led the villagers in
worshiping their idols. Then Adventist Christians came to share
the gospel. Pradhan drove the Christians from the village and
urged villagers to have nothing to do with Christianity.
   But the Adventist pastor returned in spite of taunts and threats.
Little by little the message of Christ touched the heart of the pagan
priest. He was deeply impressed that the great Creator God would
die for him. Eventually 25 members of the village gave their lives
to Jesus and joined the Adventist church. Pradhan got rid of the
village idols. With a smile spreading across his face, the former
priest said, "We have lived all our lives without the knowledge of
the true God. But we are happy that now we have a new life!"
   Not everyone in the village is happy that some have become
Christians. The 175 villagers who are not Christians persecute
the new believers. A mob tried to kill the once-respected pagan
priest. He has been dragged off to jail, beaten, and threatened.
Opposition to Christianity, which he once led, continues.
   "No matter how the villagers treat us," Pradhan said, "we are
happy to worship the true God." He prays that one day the entire
village will come to know Jesus.
    We walked out to a large field adjacent to Pradhan's home. "I
                                                                               al
                          have dedicated this land to God," he said.
                          "One day we will have a church here." But
                          the villagers are poor, and do not have the
                          money to build even a simple church.
                          At present the new believers must walk
                          several hours to worship in another village.

                            Dinabandha Pradhan (left). J. H. Zachary is
                         international evangelism coordinator for The

              Salt of the Earth,
              Light of the World




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 5:13-16; Mark 9:50;
John 8:12; 2 Cor. 4:6.

     MEMORY TEXT: "For you were once darkness, but now you
     are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light" (Ephesians 5:8,
     NKJV).

  KEY QUESTIONS: What does it mean for the Christian to be salt
and light? How do we become such agents?

   OUR WORLD'S NEED. Wherever we live, we see around us
many empty hearts, many sad faces, and many people without any
reason to live. They merely grow, reproduce, suffer, and die. They do
not really live, because they are not connected with the Source of life.
   "He who seeks to quench his thirst at the fountains of this world
will drink only to thirst again. Everywhere men are unsatisfied. They
long for something to supply the need of the soul. Only One can meet
that want . . . Christ."—The Desire of Ages, p. 187.
   Every one of us can bring people to Christ, "the way and the truth,
and the life" (John 14:6, NIV). "The love of Christ, revealed to us,
makes us debtors to all who know Him not."—Steps to Christ, p. 81.
   This week, we shall study how, by word and deed, we can add
spiritual flavor and light to the blandness and darkness of today's
world. Let us remember that Christ is the real salt and ultimate light of
this world. We can become the salt and light to people around us only
if we allow Christ to "salt" and "brighten" our lives with His life.

THE VITAL POWER OF THE CHRISTIAN (Matt. 5:13; Mark
9:50).

 A metaphor compares two objects to show how they are alike.
What metaphor does Jesus use to explain our Christian mission?
Matt. 5:13; Mark 9:50. Why does He use this metaphor?


   Jesus used the most common elements of everyday life to illustrate
the deepest lessons regarding salvation, and people listened to Him
with intense interest (Matt. 7:28, 29). In this particular case, almost at
the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus uses this particular
metaphor to emphasize the influence of a good Christian life.

   Salt is used to purify, preserve, and flavor. How can Christians
in a sinful world purify, preserve, and flavor? Put your thoughts
regarding this in the chart below.

        Purify                  Preserve                  Flavor




   "The savor of the salt represents the vital power of the Christian—
the love of Jesus in the heart, the righteousness of Christ pervading
the life. . . .
   "Unless the Holy Spirit can use us as agents through whom to
communicate to the world the truth as it is in Jesus, we are as salt that
has lost its savor and is entirely worthless."—Thoughts from the Mount
of Blessing, pp. 36, 37.

   How do we become the salt of the earth? Acts 4:13.


    To be an effective flavoring agent, salt must be thoroughly
 mixed with food. What does this tell us about how we should live
 as Christians? Does it conflict with the concept of being in the
 world but not of the world? Explain. How can we mingle with
 others in order to fulfill our global mission without being nega-
 tively affected?

                                                                        73
Monday                                            November 22
GLORIFYING GOD (Matt. 5:14-16; Eph. 5:8; 1 Thess. 5:5; 2 Cor.
4:6; John 8:12).

  After referring to salt, what other metaphor did Jesus use to
explain our work as a church and as individuals? Matt. 5:14-16.
Why are we to "shine before men"? Verse 16.


   "As the sun goes forth on its errand of love, dispelling the shades of
night and awakening the world to life, so the followers of Christ are to
go forth on their mission, diffusing the light of heaven upon those
who are in the darkness of error and sin. . . .
   "No other light ever has shone or ever will shine upon fallen man
save that which emanates from Christ."—Thoughts from the Mount of
Blessing, p. 39.

   Explain what Paul means in Ephesians 5:8 when he counsels us
to "walk in the light."


    While darkness is a symbol of sin in its various manifestations,
light is a symbol that represents the Christian virtues. Only by dis-
playing such virtues are we able to illuminate the world.
   "Our profession of faith may proclaim the theory of religion, but it
is our practical piety that holds forth the word of truth. The consistent
life, the holy conversation, the unswerving integrity, the active, be-
nevolent spirit, the godly example—these are the mediums through
which light is conveyed to the world."—The Desire of Ages, p. 307.

  Since Jesus is the Source of light, what should be our attitude
toward Him? John 8:12; 12:35, 36.


   The very God who said in the beginning, "Let there be light; and
there was light," is equally powerful today to remove any darkness
from our hearts and guide us to walk side by side with Jesus, "the light
of the world." He promised, "He who follows Me shall not walk in
darkness, but have the light of life" (John 8:12, NKJV).

   A light is: (1) meant to be seen, (2) often used as a guide, or
(3) used as a warning. Apply each of these to the duty a Christian
has as a light to the world.


     How can you be a light in each one of these areas?

TWO SUCCESSFUL LIGHTS (2 Kings 5:1-15; Acts 8:26-39).

   We read about two successful lights in 2 Kings 5:1-15 and Acts
8:26-39. As you study these passages, ask the following questions
of each story: Who? What? Where? When? How? and Why?
What can you conclude from your answers about being lights to
the world?

                     2 Kings 5:1-15              Acts 8:26-39
  Who?

  What?

  When?

  Where?

  How?

   Why?

  Conclusions

   We do not know the name of the captive girl nor her age. But we
know that she had a great faith in the true God and His prophet and
that her employers respected her. Because she was a light in the
darkness of a pagan home, a miracle occurred. "The parents of that
Hebrew maid, as they taught her of God . . . were faithful to their trust;
and in the home of the captain of the Syrian host, their child bore
witness to the God whom she had learned to honor."—Prophets and
Kings, p. 246.
   While traveling back home, the Ethiopian read Isaiah 53. But he
could not understand it. So the Lord sent him Philip, who gave him a
Bible study right then and there. As a result, the Ethiopian accepted
Christ as his Savior.
   Because Philip had the Light of the world in his heart, he could
share it with others. "There are many who are reading the Scriptures
who cannot understand their true import. All over the world men and
women are looking wistfully to heaven. . . . Many are on the verge of
the kingdom, waiting only to be gathered in."—The Acts of the Apostles,
p. 109.

   Think of at least three ways you can let your light shine in a
 manner similar to the witness of Philip and the young Israelite
 woman. Then let it shine!

                                                                       75
Wednesday                                         November 24
THESE WERE LIGHTS IN THE WORLD (Heb. 11:4-27, 32-39;
Dan. 2:48; chap. 6; Luke 4:16-19).

  Throughout the centuries, God has had human instruments
shedding His light in the world. Review Hebrews 11 to see what
some of these lights did by faith in Him.


   These people did not allow circumstances to dim their lights. They
allowed God to let His light shine through them. That is exactly what
the Lord wants us to do today. We do not need to subdue kingdoms or
harbor "spies" from a foreign nation. But we can meet the needs of the
many people around us who live in darkness.
   "God calls not only for our gifts for the needy, but for our cheerful
countenance, our hopeful words, our kindly handclasp. When Christ
healed the sick, He laid His hands upon them. So should we come in
close touch with those whom we seek to benefit.
   "There are many from whom hope has departed. Bring back the
sunshine to them. Many have lost their courage. Speak to them words
of cheer. Pray for them. There are those who need the bread of life.
Read to them from the word of God. Upon many is a soul sickness
which no earthly balm can reach nor physician heal. Pray for these
souls, bring them to Jesus."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 418.

  How was Daniel's experience a light in Babylon and Medo-
Persia? Dan. 2:48; chap. 6. Consider how you can imitate him.


   How great is the example Daniel left us! How much we need to be
like him in humility, wisdom, fidelity, and trust. These are the virtues
that help make us lights in the world.

  As the Light of the world, what "job description" did Christ
proclaim was His? Luke 4:16-21.


   "When those who profess to serve God follow Christ's example,
. . . then will the church have power to move the world."—Christ's
Object Lessons, p. 340.

   Make a list of the people you deal with every day. Even if they
profess to be Christians, ask yourself how you can be a light to
them. The sun shines on us all, the good and bad alike. How does
this fact help you to understand your job description as a light to
the world?

Thursday                                          November 25
THE GREATEST LIGHT (Luke 15:1-24; Matt. 9:9-13; Rom. 5:7-9;
Isa. 53:4, 5).

  What did the Pharisees and scribes say regarding Christ's atti-
tude toward sinners? Why did He answer with a series of three
parables? Luke 15:1-24 (compare Matt. 9:9-13).


   Christ's enemies criticized and condemned His behavior. "If Jesus
were the Messiah," they muttered amongst themselves, "He should
not receive sinners, eat with them, or be friends with them." Yet
Christ did all these things. And the criticism of His enemies actually
became the best commendation of His love for humanity. That was
precisely the reason He came to this fallen world: to seek and save the
lost, the ones who saw their need for Him.
   The fact that Jesus received sinners, ate with them, and befriended
them shows His love for even the most despised person. What Jesus
did in the past, He does today. He loves each and every one of us with
an eternal love. He gives us His company when we feel alone. He
cures our inner wounds when we are spiritually sick. He brings us
back when we are lost in sin. And He fulfills each and every one of our
true needs.
   As He sheds His light on us and we receive His abundant mercy,
we accept the sacred privilege to do the same for our neighbor.
Otherwise, how could we be the salt and the light of this world?

   What was the highest manifestation of Christ's love and light
for sinners? Isa. 53:4, 5; Rom. 5:7-9.


   In giving His life for us, Jesus revealed the depth of His divine
love. Certainly He was with sinners at the table eating with them. But
He also was with them at the cross offering them eternal life. Where
could we find a greater Light that at the cross? He is the true Light
"which enlightens everyone" (John 1:9, NRSV). He launched His
ministry by giving of Himself to others, and He continued such giving
of His life until He finally gave all at Calvary. Doesn't this move us to
give of ourselves in love and service to others?

    Take time to read carefully Isaiah 53. As you do, involve
 yourself as a saved sinner in this description of how Christ
 became the Light of the world. Then give thanks to Him for such
 a bright light shed in your life. In what ways can He help you
 reflect His light in your daily life and witness to others?


                                                                      77
Friday                                              November 26

FURTHER STUDY: Read the following texts. How do they shed
light on Matthew 5:14-16? Pss. 18:28; 27:1; 37:6; 119:105; Prov.
4:18; Luke 1:76, 79; John 8:12; Eph. 5:14; 2 Pet. 1:19.
   Read Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing, pp. 33-40; Testimonies
for the Church, vol. 5, pp. 454-467; and Testimonies for the Church,
vol. 6, pp. 273-280.

   The moral and spiritual darkness of this time demands our conse-
cration to God. What people need today is the Light of the world. We
can reflect Him by means of our Christian character.
   "Trials patiently borne, blessings gratefully received, temptations
manfully resisted, meekness, kindness, mercy, and love habitually
revealed, are the lights that shine forth in the character in contrast with
the darkness of the selfish heart, into which the light of life has never
shone."—Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing, p. 44.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:

     1. List at least five ways we can be spiritual salt and light. One
        way is given to get you started: Using our gifts and talents
        to bless others.

     2. Think of one or two other metaphors that would help ex-
        plain our duty as Christians to be witnesses for the Lord.
        Compare them with the two metaphors that Christ used.

     3. The Memory Text for this week counsels us to "walk as
        children of light" (Eph. 5:8, NKJV). Explain what it means
        to do so. What does it mean to be the children of light?

     4. Contrast the blessings of being a light for Christ to the
        moral and spiritual darkness so many people live in today.

     5. How may you be hiding your light under a bushel? If you
        are, think of ways you can let your light shine on others.

SUMMARY: We have the privilege of being the salt of this insipid
earth and the light in this dark world. But we cannot have true spiritual
flavor or brilliant light by ourselves. Jesus is the Source. He is the One
who enables us to penetrate people's hearts so they will see and accept
Him as their Savior.

                  Surfing for Jesus, Part 1
                       as told to Lynn Rose

   The sun was just coming up over the horizon as the fishing boat
neared the point of land where the sheltered sea met the open
ocean. Gary Bauer* leaned against the rail and studied the line of
waves breaking on the shore. The smell of the sea reminded him
of his teenage years working as a deck hand on a deep-sea fishing
boat and of surfing every chance he could.
   He reached for his surfboard. Who would have thought that his
love for surfing would ever bring him an opportunity to share
Jesus Christ with people who had never heard the name before?
   Bauer was a "tentmaker" (a self-supporting missionary) in a
closed Middle-Eastern country. He had been studying the lan-
guage for months and was eager to try speaking without an inter-
preter. When he heard that the waves along this stretch of ocean
were a surfer's delight, he decided to try them out for himself.
This little vacation adventure would provide an opportunity to surf
as well as practice his new language skills on people who almost
never saw outsiders.
   He found a fishing boat captain who was willing to take him to
the area, but the captain pointed out that there were no ports where
he could dock. When Gary indicated that he planned to jump ship
and surf to shore, the captain insisted on being paid in advance.
Gary smiled as he pondered what the captain must have thought
about him right then.
    The boat slowed as it neared the point where Bauer would take
his leave. As he studied the shoreline, he noticed a few masonry
homes framed by a row of mountains. But no city was in sight.
    The captain signaled that he was turning around. Suddenly
Bauer wondered if it was such a great idea to jump off the boat and
surf to shore. But he could not back down now. He tightened the
straps on his backpack and checked the strap that tethered his
surfboard to his ankle. The sea seemed so much farther down than
when he had boarded the ship, and the water was rougher than he
had anticipated. But the captain held the gate open, so he took a
 running leap and sailed into the water.

            Christ, the Center
             of Our Homes




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: John 2:1-11; Eph. 5:21-31; 1
Cor. 7:2-6; Exod. 12:3, 5-7, 13, 26-28; Luke 10:38-42; 19:1-10.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Unless the Lord builds the house, they
     labor in vain who build it" (Psalm 127:1, NKJV).

   KEY QUESTIONS: With so many opposing forces at work in our
lives, how is it possible to establish a Christian home? How do such
homes benefit society and the church?

   A CHRISTIAN HOME IS GOD'S WORK. With a divorce rate
of nearly 50 percent in some countries, perhaps the time is long over-
due to reevaluate the blessings of a Christian home. In previous lessons
this quarter, we have studied the differences between many contrasting
entities:
   1. The world and the church
   2. The old person and the new
   3. Selfishness and love
   4. Dissension and unity
   5. Sin and holiness
   6. Darkness and light
   7. The devil's work and God's
   In this week's lesson, we will study yet another two contrasting
entities—a secular family and a Christian home. In fact, marriage is
one of the two institutions that remain from Eden.

THE BLESSINGS OF A CHRISTIAN HOME (Ps. 127:1; John 2:1-
11).

   According to this week's Memory Text, how can we success-
fully build a Christian home? Ps. 127:1.


   Only the One who created the first home can help us build a
blessed Christian home today. To forget this fact would be to "labor in
vain."
   "The first work to be done in a Christian home is to see that the
Spirit of Christ abides there, that every member of the household may
be able to take his cross and follow where Jesus leads the way."—The
Adventist Home, p. 20.
   "Angels delight in a home where God reigns supreme and the
children are taught to reverence religion, the Bible, and their Crea-
tor."—The Adventist Home, p. 28.

   What spiritual lessons about the home can we draw from some
of the important facts regarding the miracle Jesus performed in
Cana? John 2:1-10.

   Important Fact           Spiritual Lesson About the Home




   When Christ becomes the center of the family, parents and children
experience true love, joy, harmony, and a high level of spirituality.
With Christ as their center, when problems or temptations come to
them, they can claim the promise of protection: "When the enemy
shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard
against him" (Isa. 59:19).

    Consider the decisions and activities your family, church family,
 or friends took part in recently. How was Christ the focus of the
 decisions taken or the activities participated in?

LOVE AND FAITHFULNESS (Eph. 5:21-31; 1 Cor. 7:2-6).

   Although it might seem unnecessary to talk about love and faith-
fulness in a Christian home, it is sad to realize that even among God's
children, selfishness and infidelity are common sins.
   Selfishness appears as indifference, coldness, rudeness, even physical
aggression. And infidelity includes more than adultery. It also is an
impure, lustful imagination (Matt. 5:27, 28).

  What does Paul say about the loving relation between husband
and wife? Eph. 5:21-31 (compare 1 Cor. 13:4-8).


   Paul describes a superior, pure love, such as the love Christ mani-
fested toward the church to sanctify and redeem it. It is a love of
generosity, self-denial, and fidelity; a love that "never fails" (1 Cor.
13:8, NIV), if it is fed with respect, courtesy, and prayer. How much
did Christ love the church? Enough to die for it!
   "Love should be revealed in action. It should flow out in all home
intercourse [communication], showing itself in thoughtful kindness,
in gentle, unselfish courtesy. There are homes where His principle is
carried out—homes where God is worshiped and truest love reigns."
—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 144.

  How does the apostle express the mutual obligation of love in
marriage? 1 Cor. 7:2-6.


   These verses point out the need to demonstrate love in a marriage.
Following the counsel in these verses would help to prevent adultery.
The physical expression of love between husband and wife is a part of
God's plan for their happiness and unity (Gen. 2:24; Matt. 19:5; Eph.
5:31). Nevertheless, this intimate relation is not just the union of two
bodies, but of two hearts. It is not merely a pleasant physical activity,
but a deep joy to be so loved. "Marriage is honorable among all, and
the bed undefiled" (Heb. 13:4). How does our focus on and trust in
Christ keep us undefiled? Remember, "one steadfast look to the Sav-
iour uplifted upon the cross will do more to purify the mind and heart
from every defilement than will all the scientific explanations by the
ablest tongue."—Testimonies on Sexual Behavior, Adultery, and Di-
vorce, p. 108.

    How can loyalty (both sexual and otherwise) between spouses
 translate into more stable societies and churches?

THE INFLUENCE OF THE CHRISTIAN HOME (Isa. 39:1-4).

   "The well-being of society, the success of the church, the prosper-
ity of the nation, depend upon home influences."—The Ministry of
Healing, p. 349.

   It is a shame Hezekiah did not realize the truth in the above
quote when representatives of the Babylonian king delivered a
letter to him upon hearing that he had been sick (see 2 Kings
20:1-11). As you read verses 12-15, decide what Hezekiah should
have done.


   Despite the fact that Hezekiah was giving the Babylonians a grand
tour of his palace, Isaiah's keen question, "What have they seen in
your house?" is a thought-provoking question for us. Which of God's
blessings do we most appreciate? Our house with all its treasures, or
the godly love, loyalty, and fidelity that reside in our Christian home?
When people visit our home, are they more impressed with the things
we own, or with our Christian demeanor?
   Isaiah warned Hezekiah that a day would come " 'when all that is
in your house . . . shall be carried to Babylon; nothing shall be left' "
(2 Kings 20:17, NKJV). The only thing that would serve Hezekiah
well would be his faith in God. Yet God was not what the Babylonians
saw during their guided tour.
   In principle, Isaiah's warning is for us also. There will come a
time when all that we own will be worthless. In light of the last days
and Christ's second coming, the only thing that will serve us well
will be our faith in Him.

   How strong can the influence of a Christian home be? Zech.
8:23.


   Speaking of the spiritual recovery and the future of His ancient
people, the Lord foretold the day when people of other nations would
be greatly attracted to them.
   In our "personal lives . . . [we] are to make the religion of Jesus
Christ so attractive that others will be drawn to surrender their lives
to the Saviour. God's church is now to be a blessing to the world."
—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 1104.

   Whom are you influencing? What type of influence are you?
 Think of at least two things you and your family can do to

CHRIST, THE SALVATION OF OUR HOMES (Exod. 12:3, 5-7,13,
26-28; Luke 10:38-42).

   How did the Israelites preserve their families during the last
plague? Exod. 12:3, 5-7, 13, 26-28. What did the lamb symbolize?
1 Cor. 5:7. What application can you make of the first Passover to
your family?


  What does an incident in the home of Mary, Martha, and
Lazarus teach us about communion with Christ? Luke 10:38-42.


   Jesus was a friend of all three siblings. His presence blessed their
home. But in a special way, Mary appreciated that Friend for His
wisdom, forgiveness, and salvation. Consider the words Jesus spoke
to Martha about her and Mary. There was no condemnation in His
choice of words or voice, but rather a clear emphasis on spiritual
values (vs. 41, 42).
   What kind of communion do we have with Christ? Although we
might be extremely busy, do we dedicate time for Him in our homes?
   Imagine Christ visiting your home. If He came to spend a couple of
days with you, what would you do? Certainly you would give Him
your best room and serve Him your best food. But would you have to
change the course of your conversations, turn off your favorite TV
programs, or hide your favorite books? Would your family be able to
continue with the same types of activity in which you have always
been engaged? Or would you have to adopt a lifestyle artificial to your
normal routine?
   In one sense, these verses are really dealing with life goals. "What
has our attention most of the time? Martha is focused on her own
goals. She is so busy being gracious and polite and a good hostess
that she has no time to be with the Lord. We may say that all we
have—time, life, money—is the Lord's, but does He have our attention?
Martha's social proprieties kept her from focusing her attention on
Jesus and His agenda for her life.
   "You and I can lose sight of who we are and whose we are very
easily. The good things in life . . . can begin to choke out God's life in
us. As we make God and His presence in our lives our primary focus,
we find He is the key to everything."—Bruce Larson, The
Communicator's Commentary: Luke, Lloyd J. Ogilvie, gen. ed. (Waco,
Tex.: Word Books, 1983), p. 186.

   What has your family been focusing on during the past month?
 Do your family priorities prevent you from focusing on Christ?

IN JESUS' PRESENCE (Luke 19:1-10).

   What did Jesus say about Zacchaeus's home? Luke 19:1-10.


    Zacchaeus was a sincere man. He wanted to have an encounter
with Jesus because he was not satisfied with himself. He was looking
for a better life that no material gain or riches in this world could ever
provide.
    "No sooner did Zacchaeus yield to the influence of the Holy Spirit
than he cast aside every practice contrary to integrity."—The Desire of
Ages, p. 555.
    Like Zacchaeus's home, many families today could find salvation
if they only had the desire to change and turn their lives over to Christ.
When we seek and find the Lord, old things will pass away, and all
things will become new (see 2 Cor. 5:17).
    "Today salvation has come to this house," said Jesus. His divine
presence performed yet another miracle. "Salvation has not come just
to Zacchaeus, but to his entire household. When the head of the
household commits his or her life to the Lord, the whole house is
blessed. Salvation had come that very moment to Zacchaeus's house."
—Larson, The Communicator's Commentary: Luke, p. 271.
    How is your home? A great number of Christian homes suffer the
typical problems associated with secular influences: a lack of spiritu-
ality; disregard for the Bible and the Spirit of Prophecy; marital
infidelity; rudeness, aggression, and disharmony; lack of discipline in
rearing children and keeping the house in order.
    These and many other problems undermine Christian values in the
home. However, God can make profound changes in our homes just as
 he did in Zacchaeus's.
    Difficulties, however, will still haunt your doorstep. But when they
 find their way inside the four walls of your house, bringing sorrow and
 discouragement to your family, the divine Helper, the Holy Spirit, will
 give you strength, hope, wisdom, and support. When Christ is the
 center of our homes, we can draw love, wisdom, and support from
 Him to fulfill our needs and resolve our seemingly impossible prob-
 lems.

    What activities are you involved in that influence your family
 members (or church family members) for or against Christ?
 Recall a time when focusing on Christ helped you resolve a
 difficult problem in your home. In what ways can you depend on
 Christ from now on to be the constant Helper in any family
 problem you may face?

FURTHER STUDY: What does the Bible teach us about the Christian's
relationship toward children? Exod. 20:12; Deut. 30:1, 2; 1 Sam. 1:11,

first three chapters of The Adventist Home.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. After studying this week's lesson, how would you answer
     the Key Questions in Sabbath's lesson?

     2. What kind of influence does your home have on your chil-
        dren, your church, and your neighborhood? How much
        influence do you receive in your home from your church in
        contrast with what you receive from the world?

     3. How can Christ become the center of our homes? List at
        least five ways. One is given here to get you started: Make
        God's Word the norm for the behavior of all family mem-
        bers, including the parents.

     4. Contrast the blessings of a Christian home with the secular
        families of our day.

     5. Read Psalm 68:6. What can you do if you miss being in a
        "traditional" family setting? How can your "traditional"
        family, church family, or family of friends include people
        who presently have no family to call their own?

     6. Think of one thing you can do during the next week in each
        of the following areas to improve the spiritual life of your
        family: secret prayer, the family altar, Bible study, Chris-
        tian service.

SUMMARY: In this sinful world, it is possible to establish a family
with Christ as the center. Such homes are a blessing to both society
and the church. Plus they are the best school to prepare ourselves for
the heavenly home.

                   Surfing for Jesus, Part 2
                        As told to Lynn Rose

    Gary Bauer,* a self-supporting missionary in a Middle-Eastern
country, grabbed his surfboard and jumped overboard. After the
jolt of hitting the water, his fear was replaced by a sense of
adventure, and he paddled toward the shore.
    As he spread his wet clothes out on the sandy beach to dry, he
noticed two boys watching him from one of the houses farther up
the beach. Bauer grabbed his surfboard, turned toward the surf,
and paddled out beyond the breakers. He found a wave and stead-
ied himself on the board, letting the wave carry him toward shore.
He had no time to notice the growing crowd of children gathering
on the beach to watch him. They had never seen a surfer before.
    As his wave died, Bauer paddled to shore. He waved at the
children and greeted them in Arabic. Two of the children turned and
ran toward home but soon returned with their parents. A crowd
gathered, and Bauer decided to try his Arabic, a few words at a
time.
    He noticed that the people called him by a name he had never
 heard before. (Later he learned that it means "man from the sea.")
    Bauer continued surfing all morning, and the crowd on the
 beach shouted and clapped when he successfully rode the big
 waves in to shore. While he rested, he let some of the boys paddle
 around on his surfboard. They loved it!
    Someone invited Bauer home for a meal, and he gladly ac-
 cepted. After dark he built a fire on the beach and invited the
 villagers to gather around and tell stories. He had studied the
 Koran and knew that it taught that Isa, Jesus, was a prophet, a kind
 and loving miracle worker. But the Koran did not say that Isa is the
 Son of God or that He came to die to redeem humanity from sin.
 Bauer told the villagers the rest of the story, including what Isa had
 done for him.
    Bauer made friends during his short surfing vacation. When the
 time came to leave, he gave his surfboard to the village children
 who had admired it. He said farewell to his new friends and caught
 a ride back to the city with a truck driver.
    No one was baptized during Bauer's surfing vacation, but he
 had introduced the people to his close friend, Isa, and had planted
 seeds of truth for a later harvest.

            How Are We Today?




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 24:4, 5, 11-13, 24;
7:15-20; Rom. 8:35-39; 13:11-14; Rev. 3:15-20.

     MEMORY VERSE: "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If
     anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him
     and dine with him, and he with Me" (Revelation 3:20, NKJV).

   KEY QUESTION: How can each church reach a higher level of
spirituality and avoid being absorbed by the worldly current of life?

   FAITHFUL TO THE END? "There is a church which sends in its
annual statistical statement, year after year, as follows:
   Number of members added by baptism                     0
   Number of members dismissed by letter                  5
   Number of members who have died                        3
   Amount raised for home missions                        0
   Amount raised for foreign missions                     0
   Pray for us, brethren, that we continue faithful unto the end."
—Encyclopedia of 7700 Illustrations, Paul Lee Tan, ed. (Rockville,
Md.: Assurance Publishers, 1985), p. 766.
   While it is true we can jiggle statistics to prove almost anything, it
is also true that this church had a problem. It was not their poor
showing in the numbers so much as it was the fact that they truly
believed they were being faithful and therefore had need of nothing!
   Are you, is your local congregation, like this? If so, how would you
know? As you study this week's lesson, take time to examine your
own heart. Can you hear the Savior knocking?

NO OTHER FOUNDATION (Matt. 24:4, 5, 11-13, 24; 7:15-20).

   Summarize Jesus' "prophecy" concerning false prophets and
their teachings. What do you think Christ wanted us to know
about such prophets, considering His statement that they will
come in sheep's clothing but be as ravenous as wolves? Matt. 24:4,
5, 11-13, 24; 7:15-20.


   This is the time Jesus foresaw just before His second coming. "But
he who endures to the end shall be saved" (Matt. 24:13, NKJV). How
could we recognize the false prophets and beware of them? By their
fruits and their behavior. Are they obedient to all of God's word, or
not? (Matt. 7:15-20). Do they teach Bible truth? (Isa. 8:20). This is the
key to identifying and repelling their teachings.
   Many sincere people belong to different churches that teach what is
not in the Bible. Thus, truth remains hidden and unknown to them.
But the day will come when they will seek and find the truth.
   "Before the final visitation of God's judgments upon the earth
there will be among the people of the Lord such a revival of primitive
godliness as has not been witnessed since apostolic times. The Spirit
and power of God will be poured out upon His children. At that time
many will separate themselves from those churches in which the love
of this world has supplanted love for God and His word."—The Great
Controversy, p. 464.

   What is the only foundation of our faith? 1 Cor. 3:11.


   While Satan is enlarging his kingdom through false teachings, he
also is working inside the heart to weaken the faith of God's children.
Then doubt, religious uncertainty, and indifference can invade the
inner life until the foundation of faith loses firmness and begins to
tremble.
   But we must remember that "the solid foundation of God stands"
(2 Tim. 2:19). We can trust in the Lord because He never changes
(Heb. 13:8). He fulfils His promises (2 Cor. 1:20) and loves us "with
an everlasting love" (Jer. 31:3).

    Read Matthew 7:24-27. Compare Proverbs 10:25. How do
 these verses help you to understand the importance of a firm
 spiritual foundation?
    Describe what type of material, skill, and crew are needed to
 build on the rock. Then do the same for a house built on the

FREE FROM WORLDLINESS AND APOSTASY (1 Tim. 4:1; Rom.
8:35-39; 13:11-14).

   What do we learn about events in the last days from 1 Timothy
4:1?


   "As the storm approaches, a large class who professed faith in the
third angel's message, but have not been sanctified through obedience
to the truth, abandon their position and join the ranks of the opposi-
tion."—The Great Controversy, p. 608.
   Sadly, a good number of our members, after some years of mean-
ingful fellowship, will abandon the church, the faith, and the Lord.
This will show that we are living in the last days of history. What a sad
experience for the body of Christ!—to lose friends and family mem-
bers because of a lack of spiritual perseverance and faithfulness. What
can each of us do personally to reduce this painful loss? What can the
church do?

   Summarize the assurance Paul gives us in Romans 8:35-39
regarding such events.


   "Paul lists ten items that cannot separate us from the love of God
[vs. 38, 39]. The tenth is broad enough to include anything that may
have been omitted. All the terms are perhaps to be taken in their most
general sense. Their very indefiniteness serves to emphasize Paul's
point that there is nothing that one can think of in all the created
universe that can put a distance between a Christian and his loving
Saviour."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 580.

   Neither height nor depth. Some Bible scholars believe that Paul
here is referring to the fact that, during his time, many people believed
that the destiny of each individual was governed by the star under
which he or she was born. The word he used for height was the time
when any star was at its highest and therefore most powerful. The
word he used for depth is the period when the star was at its lowest
and least powerful stage.

    Think about the other eight categories of things Paul says can
 never separate us from Christ. What specific items could you
 put in each of them? Knowing the time in which we live, what
 attitude and behavior should we keep before the Lord? Rom.
13:11-14. Define the "works of darkness" we are to "cast off"
 and the "armour of light" we are to put on in their place.

LESSONS FROM LAODICEA (Rev. 3:15-17).

  The historic church of Laodicea symbolizes the church in our day.
There is no other church in Revelation after this one. Therefore, the
message to this church is not only about us but for us.

   Christ's first words to Laodicea are recorded in Revelation
3:15, 16. What does being neither cold nor hot symbolize? (see
Matt. 15:8; Luke 6:46). Why does He wish this church were either
one or the other?


   Neither cold nor hot. "It has been suggested that this figurative
expression must have been particularly meaningful to the Christians
at Laodicea. One of the chief landmarks of that vicinity was a water-
fall over which a stream from the hot springs at Hierapolis flowed,
leaving mineral deposits. Laodicea's water source was not these hot
springs or a cold one, but a water tower filled by an aqueduct that
shows deposits from similar mineral water, probably warm."—SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 761.

  Summarize in your own words the spiritual condition of the
Laodecian church (see Rev. 3:17). What one word do you think
describes their condition best?


   The Laodiceans had a very high concept of themselves (see Rom.
12:3). Because they believed they were fine, they were satisfied with
who they thought they were. As a result, they depended on themselves
instead of on God, and more and more they became victims of the
enemy.
   "Of itself wealth is not wrong. However, the possession of wealth
subjects its possessor to temptations to pride and self-complacency,
and against these his only protection is spiritual humility. . . .
   "The possession of important truths held only on the level of
intellectual acceptance but not allowed to permeate the soul, leads to
spiritual pride and religious bigotry. Even the church of God, strong
in the structure of its organization and rich with jewels of truth, can
easily become a doctrinal bigot and immorally proud of its riches of
truth."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, pp. 761, 762.

    Consider the parable in Luke 18:9-14. Which character in the
 story is like the Laodicean church? What happened to each
 character, and why? Which character is most like you?


                                                                    91

THE DIVINE REMEDY (Rev. 3:18, 19).

   Yesterday, in seeking to answer the question How are we today?
we began studying God's words to the Laodicean church. Take a few
minutes now to review God's admonition to this church.
   We will continue our study as we take a look at God's remedy for
the Laodiceans' spiritual condition.

   What does each ingredient of God's remedy symbolize? Rev.
3:18 (the verses following each ingredient provide clues for your
answer).

     gold (Gal. 5:6; James 2:5; 1 Tim. 6:18)

     white raiment (Gal. 3:27)

     eyesalve (John 16:8-11)

  God's three-part cure for Laodicea's spiritual ailment was a vivid
one for three reasons:
  1. Laodicea was one of the great banking and financial cities of its
      time. Reportedly, when the city was struck by an earthquake in
      A.D. 60, its resources enabled it to rebuild without accepting
      government assistance from Rome.
  2. Laodicea was famous for the production of outer garments made
      from the wool of black sheep.
  3. The Laodicean temple honoring the Phrygian god, Men Karou,
      supported a reknowned medical school, which dispensed throughout
      the world an ointment for the eyes.

  After chastening the Laodicean church in Revelation 3:15-18,
what reassurance does God give them? Verse 19.


   Repent. "The verb is in the singular, stressing the personal, indi-
vidual nature of this admonition. Repentance, like salvation, can never
be accomplished en masse. . . . This new attitude of sorrow for the past
and zeal for the future is Christ's purpose for the Laodicean church."
—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 763.

    As we saw earlier, the Laodiceans had replaced God's gold,
 raiment, and eyesalve with poor substitutes of their own. What
 things in your life might be replacing God's three-part cure for
 spiritual ill-health?

AT THE DOOR OF OUR HEART (Rev. 3:20, 21; Eph. 3:14-19).

   In Revelation 3:20, Christ continues His conversation with the
Laodicean church. What kind of relationship is symbolized by
Christ's desire to dine with us? Explain your answer.
   What significance lies in the fact that Christ knocks rather than
just opens the door and comes in?


   The Greeks usually ate three meals a day. Breakfast (akratisma)
most likely consisted of a piece of dried bread dunked in wine, while
the midday meal (ariston) was a snack hastily eaten along the road-
side or in the city square. But the evening meal (deipnon) was the
main meal. Because it was eaten when the day's work was completed,
it was a meal over which the people could linger. Deipnon is the
original word John used in verse 20.
   Jesus desires to abide with us as we linger in His presence. The real
therapy for Laodicea comes from Him, the divine Healer of souls. He
only can put an end to our spiritual lukewarmness.
   "Jesus is going from door to door, standing in front of every soul
temple, proclaiming, 'I stand at the door, and knock.' . . . If the voice
of Jesus is not heeded at once, it becomes confused in the mind with a
multitude of other voices, the world's care and business engross the
attention, and conviction dies away. . . . The heavenly Guest is stand-
ing at our door, while you are piling up obstructions to bar His
entrance. Jesus is knocking through the prosperity He gives you. He
loads you with blessings to test your fidelity, that they may flow out
from you to others."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-
 mentary, vol. 7, pp. 965-967.

  What promise does Revelation 3:21 give to those who over-
come?
  We must overcome as Jesus overcame. Explain how Jesus over-
came. In your explanation, provide biblical references.


    What a beautiful promise! "The work of overcoming is not re-
stricted to the age of the martyrs. The conflict is for us, in these days
of subtle temptation to worldliness, to self-security, to indulgence of
pride, covetousness, false doctrines, and immorality of life."—Ellen
G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 966.

     How does Paul invite us to welcome Christ into our hearts?
 Eph. 3:14-21. Won't you welcome Christ into your heart now, or
 if you have already, thank Him for abiding with you?

                                                                      93

FURTHER STUDY: Read Matthew 22:1-14 and relate it to Jesus'
message to the Laodicean church in Revelation 3:14-19.
   Read Selected Messages, book 1, pp. 121-128 and Testimonies for
the Church, vol. 4, pp. 84-94.

   After Jesus' resurrection, Mary said, "They have taken away my
Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him" (John 20:13). By
observing the spiritual condition of unfaithful and nominal Christians,
could we also say, "Where is Christ? They have taken Him away"?
   Yes, the Lord is in heaven. He is also in the Bible, among His
beloved people, and we can read His love in the wonders of nature.
But, is Jesus where He especially wants to be: in our heart? (Rev.
3:20; Eph. 3:17).
   "We must have the buyers and the sellers cleared out of the soul
temple, that Jesus may take up His abode within us. Now He stands at
the door of the heart as a heavenly merchantman; He says, 'Behold, I
stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the
door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.'..
Oh, shall we not open the heart's door to this heavenly visitor."
—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 964.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. According to Revelation 3:17, what is the most deceitful
     spiritual condition a person can be in? Why is this condition
     the most deceitful?

     2. The Laodicean message at first appears to be quite harsh.
        But where in the message do we discover Jesus' love?

     3. After studying this week's lesson, how would you answer
        the Key Question in Sabbath's lesson?

     4. Contrast the blessings of being a fervent, consecrated child
        of God with the lukewarm Christian who is neither strong
        nor happy in her or his faith.

SUMMARY: The Lord knows His church very well and is able to
advise us regarding our spiritual condition (Rev. 3:15). But along with
such advice, He offers us His guaranteed remedy to cure our spiritual
condition. As a result, we shall inherit a place beside the throne of
God.

Mal                       Myanmar Messengers
                                 J. H. Zachary

          Joy Tan hung on tightly as the logging truck bounced over the
      rough mountain roads of Myanmar (Burma). Riding on the truck's
      trailer, which had no sides or floor except for two metal cross beams
      and four upright beams that held the logs in place, Tan and her
      team of lay evangelists knew that one unexpected bump could jar
      them loose and throw them under the wheels of the huge truck.
      But this is how the ministry team traveled to the remote villages of
      Myanmar where they held evangelistic meetings. And often trav-
      eling this way was not the only danger they faced.
          One trip took them to Nat Mon village, a part-Christian, part-
      Buddhist community where residents earned money by selling
      jade and opium. In Nat Mon, religion takes second place to money.
          Most of the people of Nat Mon were not interested in the
      gospel. But some of the Buddhists were impressed by the team's
      health emphasis and stayed to hear the Bible stories. Others in the
      city resented the evangelists' work and demanded their death.
      They even hired 50 men to kill them. The evangelists had come a
       long way to share the gospel with these people, and they were not
      eager to leave before the job was done. They prayed that God
       would protect them as they shared their faith with these people.
       Some villagers intervened and convinced the would-be killers to
      send the gospel workers out of the village instead.
          Attendance at the meetings grew. Many Buddhists were im-
       pressed by the spirit of the team members and rallied around the
       missionaries. The evangelistic team finished its work without harm.
           In 1996 Tan led a team of evangelists to Pa Doh village. "This
       place was so different from Nat Mon." Tan said. "The people were
       eager to hear about the truth of the gospel." Tan's face beamed
       with joy as she remembered Pa Doh. One of the persons preparing
       for baptism fell ill with a high fever the day before the baptism.
       The young woman was told that she was too sick to walk to the
       river. She might become chilled and die. But when the baptismal
       candidates lined up at the river, the sick girl stepped into line. "I
       must be baptized," she said. "I want to be ready to meet Jesus."
       Instead of becoming more seriously ill, the girl was healed.
           With faith such as Tan and her fellow workers exhibit, the
       gospel work in Myanmar will continue to grow.

         J. H. Zachary is international coordinator for evangelism with The
      Ouiet Hour, located in Redlands, California.

Lesson 12                                           December 11-17


               Strong and Active
              for the Final Crisis




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Pet. 1:5-11; Eph. 6:10-18;
1 Cor. 10:12, 13; Heb. 2:18; John 5:39; Acts 2:1, 2.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Blessed is the man who endures tempta-
     tion; for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown
     of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him"
     (James 1:12, NKJV).

  KEY QUESTIONS: What is the final crisis? How does it involve
God's church? And how can we come through it victoriously?

    MISSION AND CRISIS. Israel was to represent God to the Gen-
tiles in such an attractive way that the Gentiles would be drawn into
their fold (Isa. 56:8). Sabbathkeeping would play an important role in
the success of this mission (vs. 1, 2, 6, 7). To this end, the Lord became
more specific in Isaiah 58:12-14. Take time to read these verses now.
    The church's mission today is no different. God's law was breached
when the Sabbath of His fourth commandment was changed by the
little horn power (Dan. 7:23-25). But God will have a remnant people
who will restore this breach, especially through the proclamation of
the gospel as it is found in the three angels' messages (Rev. 14:6-12).
    The proclamation of these messages will arouse a worldwide crisis
over whether people should obey God's law or human tradition. This
week's lesson will focus, not on the crisis, but on Christ and how He
can help us be a successful part of the remnant.

Sunday                                           December 12
GROWING AND WORKING (Eph. 2:19-22; 2 Pet. 1:5-11).

   What assurance do we have that the church is built on a solid
foundation and therefore cannot be shaken, even during a crisis?
Eph. 2:19-22.


   In whom. "That is, in Jesus Christ. This expression, the key phrase
of the epistle. . . expresses a mystic but real experience, as does the
phrase 'in the Lord' at the end of the verse. Christian growth takes
place by our being 'in him.' "—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p.
1011.

  How does Peter express the progressive experience of a true
Christian? 2 Pet. 1:5-11. Why does he begin with faith and end
with love?


    Peter's marvelous ladder helps us climb toward a fruitful spiritual
life. "There is no place in the school of Christ where we graduate. We
are to work on the plan of addition, and the Lord will work on the plan
of multiplication."—Selected Messages, book 1, p. 379.
    Growing in faith equips us to work for God. In 2 Corinthians 5:18,
20, Paul states that this work involves being ambassadors for Christ,
reconciling others to Him. Compare the following aspects of being an
ambassador to a foreign country with Christians' being ambassadors
for Christ: (1) Ambassadors live in a country foreign to them, among
people who usually do not speak their language and who observe
different customs, traditions, and laws. (2) Ambassadors speak for the
country they represent. They are the voice of that country. (3) Coun-
tries are often judged by the behavior of their ambassadors. So they
can bring either honor or disgrace to their country.
    We grow in order to be useful instruments in God's hands. As His
ambassadors, we become instruments of reconciliation. What a privi-
lege to be God's representatives on this earth! To recognize that God
has given us such a ministry of reconciliation should draw us together
as a united front to bring the world to Him in these last days.

   How does the work of reconciliation relate to the church's
mission as outlined in Sabbath's lesson? How can the Sabbath
assist in the reconciliation process?


   How can the Sabbath help us to maintain a growing Christian
 experience?

                                                                     97
Monday                                            December 13
"THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD" (Eph. 6:10-18; 5:15-17).

   We are at war against the evil one. And we want to triumph over
him. Paul advises that we do so by putting on the whole armor of God.
Read Ephesians 6:10-17. In the chart below, list each piece of God's
armor and what it symbolizes. Then explain why it is a fitting symbol.
(For example: The shield is a good symbol for faith, because faith
protects us from the fiery darts of temptation.)

     Piece of               What It                 Why Is It a
     Armor                 Symbolizes             Fitting Symbol?




   "The whole armor of God" (v. 11). "The Christian is vulnerable at
many spots, and often that characteristic he thinks is his strongest
turns out, under temptation, to be his weakest. As a chain is no
stronger than its weakest link, so the Christian is no stronger than his
weakest element of character. In view of the variety of foes that must
be met and the various weaknesses of the flesh, nothing less than the
entire armor will suffice."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1044.

   Along with the use of God's armor, what else should we do in
these evil days? Eph. 5:15-17. What does Paul mean by "redeem-
ing the time" in verse 16?


   This is the time when we must be wise, because our adversary "the
devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour"
(1 Pet. 5:8, NKJV). He is using these final hours to tempt, deceive,
weaken, and destroy as many people as possible.

   In Ephesians 6:18, Paul adds that to our walking circum-
spectly and wearing God's armor, we should pray. What three
things about prayer does he stress in this verse? Consider your
own prayers carefully. Are they characterized by these three
things? What steps can you take to improve?

Tuesday                                           December 14
VICTORIOUS IN TEMPTATION (Heb. 2:18; James 1:12; Rev.
3:10).

   The tempter does not rest. He works everywhere and against every-
one. We need to remember this fact in order to resist him through
Christ, with the help of His holy angels. If we become self-confident
and begin to neglect our relationship with God, we will fall victim to
our enemy. "Let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall"
(1 Cor. 10:12, NKJV).
   It is encouraging to know that God will not allow us "to be tempted
beyond" our strength, "but with the temptation will also make the way
of escape" (v. 13).
   "We shall often have to bow down and weep at the feet of Jesus
because of our shortcomings and mistakes, but we are not to be
discouraged. Even if we are overcome by the enemy, we are not cast
off, not forsaken or rejected of God. No; Christ is at the right hand of
God, who also maketh intercession for us."—Steps to Christ, p. 64.

  What is Jesus able to do for those who are tempted, and why?
Heb. 2:18.


   "As an overcomer He has given us the advantage of His victory,
that in our efforts to resist the temptations of Satan we may unite our
weakness to His strength, our worthlessness to His merits."—Testimo-
nies for the Church, vol. 3, p. 480.

  What beatitude (blessing) and promise does James express for
those who endure temptation? James 1:12. What is significant
about the promised gift God will give to those who love Him?


   In this week's lesson we are exalting God's great blessings to His
faithful children: (1) He helps us to grow and work for Him; (2) He
gives us His whole armor to overcome the enemy; (3) He makes us
victorious over temptation; and (4) He encourages us with this beati-
tude and promise. Through the Holy Spirit, God gives us our personal
victories, as well as victory for His church (Zech. 4:6).

    How does the Lord promise to keep us "from the hour of
 trial" which shall come to the earth? Rev. 3:10. Put your name
 in the following part of the verse: "Because you, (your name),
 have kept My command to persevere, I also will keep you, (your
 name), from the hour of trial which shall come upon the whole
 world" (NKJV).

                                                                      99
Wednesday                                          December 15
IN COMMUNION WITH GOD (1 Thess. 5:17; John 5:39).

  What concise counsel does Paul give us? 1 Thess. 5:17. How
would you suggest a person follow this advice?


   Prayer is the source of spiritual power. It is impossible to have a
relationship with God without prayer. If we love Him, we shall feel a
special pleasure in seeking His presence and talking with Him. He is
our best Friend. How, then, can we even think of living without
constant communion with Him?
   When a Christian homemaker commented that she prayed all the
time, a friend asked, "How can you get any work done if you're
praying all the time?" The first women responded this way: "While I
do the laundry, I ask God to wash my soul. While I iron the clothes, I
pray that the Lord will take out the wrinkles of my character. And
when I sweep the floors, I ask Jesus to clean the chambers of my
heart."

  Besides prayer, how else can we have communion with God?
John 5:39.


   We cannot feed our spiritual life without food from the Word.
Through Bible study, we can learn how to triumph over the enemy.
Read in Matthew 4:1-11 how Jesus overcame temptation. Our strength
comes from knowing and practicing the Word of God. "But be doers
of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves" (James 1:22,
NKJV).
   "Temptations often appear irresistible because, through neglect of
prayer and the study of the Bible, the tempted one cannot readily
remember God's promises and meet Satan with the Scripture weap-
ons."—The Great Controversy, p. 600.
   It is in the silence of the soul that we can often find the fountain of
a powerful Christian experience. Read Isaiah 30:15; Mark 1:35; 6:31;
Luke 5:15, 16; 6:12. In these verses, we find examples of how to
fulfill the need for prayer and for creative spiritual meditation.
   "While we are to labor earnestly for the salvation of the lost, we
must also take time for meditation, for prayer, and for the study of the
word of God. Only the work accomplished with much prayer, and
sanctified by the merit of Christ, will in the end prove to have been
efficient for good."—The Desire of Ages, p. 362.

   Examine your daily Bible study habits. Make a list of ways to
 improve. Plan to put into practice at least one of those ways.

SEARCHING OUR HEARTS (Acts 2:1-8; 1:8; Rev. 18:1).

  Describe the early church's experience with the Holy Spirit.
Acts 2:1, 2. What was the Holy Spirit able to do for them, and
why?


   Note that (1) Christ's followers were united, (2) they were praying,
(3) the Spirit came upon them with a visible manifestation that in-
cluded a mighty wind and tongues of fire, (4) they began to speak the
languages of people from other nations who were dwelling in Jerusa-
lem.
   "For the outpouring of the Spirit every lover of the cause of truth
should pray. And as far as lies in our power, we are to remove every
hindrance to His working. The Spirit can never be poured out while
variance and bitterness toward one another are cherished by the mem-
bers of the church. Envy, jealousy, evil surmising, and evil-speaking
are of Satan, and they effectually bar the way against the Holy Spirit's
working."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 42.
   Like the primitive church, how much we need the guidance and
outpouring of the Holy Spirit! "A revival and a reformation must take
place, under the ministration of the Holy Spirit. . . . Revival signifies a
renewal of spiritual life, a quickening of the powers of mind and heart,
a resurrection from spiritual death. Reformation signifies a reorgani-
zation, a change in ideas and theories, habits and practices."
 —Selected Messages, book 1, p. 128.

   What will the Holy Spirit enable us to do? Acts 1:8.


   This verse gives us four outstanding items:
   1. A promise: the coming of the Spirit.
   2. A power: the divine power to do God's work.
   3. A commission: to be witnesses to the Lord.
   4. A territory: the whole world, from our community to the end of
the earth.

   The Spirit sanctifies our lives and gives us power to share the
gospel and finish God's work. The day will come when the Lord will
fulfill His promise to illuminate all the earth with His glory.

   Examine your own life carefully. What hindrances might
 there be that could prevent the Holy Spirit from doing His
 work? Ask God to help you remove whatever they might be.


                                                                       101
Friday                                             December 17
FURTHER STUDY: Read the following promises regarding God's
help. Choose one or two of your favorites to memorize during the
coming week. Pss. 9:9; 27:5; 37:39, 40; 56:3: 91:1, 2; Isa. 33:2.
   Read Selected Messages, book 2, pp. 367-375.

   We are not living in just any time. This is the time in which the
Lord is calling us to be filled with His Spirit's fire and power.
   "God calls upon us to awake, for the end is near. Every passing
hour is one of activity in the heavenly courts to make ready a people
upon the earth to act a part in the great scenes that are soon to open
upon us. These passing moments, that seem of so little value to us, are
weighty with eternal interests. They are molding the destiny of souls
for everlasting life or eternal death. The words we utter today in the
ears of the people, the works we are doing, the spirit of the message
we are bearing, will be a savor of life unto life or of death unto death.
   "My brethren, do you realize that your own salvation, as well as the
destiny of other souls, depends upon the preparation you now make
for the trial before us?"—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, pp. 716,
717.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Contrast the blessings of being strong and victorious in
     these final days through the work of the Holy Spirit with
     the negative aspects of neglecting spiritual preparation and
     living for the world and oneself.

   2. After studying this week's lesson, how would you answer
      the Key Questions in Sabbath's lesson?

   3. What is the best way to tell someone about the final crisis?
      Would it depend on the person you want to tell? The type of
      person you are? The part of the world in which you live?

SUMMARY: This is not a time for weak Christians. The Lord wants
us to be anchored solidly in Him, strong in our faith, strong to repel
temptations, and strong to testify for Christ. This is possible only if we
allow the Holy Spirit to work in our hearts and to empower us to
reflect our Savior's character.

              From Komsomol* to Christian
                            Barbara Huff

    The young man studied the telephone number on the piece of
paper, then looked at the young woman who had given it to him.
"Are you Larisa?" he asked in disbelief. "I am Michael, the former
Komsomol leader! I've been trying to call you for two months!"
    Larisa Cholopova had first heard of Michael several months
before when she was examining records at a factory. One of the
workers there had told her that a former Komsomol leader had
quit his job to become a Christian. The news had surprised Larisa.
She wondered what could have made the man quit a steady job to
become a Christian. The factory worker offered to introduce Larisa
to the former Komsomol leader, so Larisa left her name and
telephone number.
    But before she could meet the man, Larisa became seriously ill
and was hospitalized. A friend visited her in the hospital and told
her about a study group she was attending. The study group
sounded interesting, so when Larisa was strong enough, she went.
 It was at this meeting that she met Michael. At first Larisa had
argued nearly every point the group discussed. But as she became
better acquainted with the members of the group, she found that
Christianity made sense.
    Larisa's health problems persisted. When the doctors gave her
a grim prognosis, she accepted it as God's punishment for her past
deeds. But she asked her Christian friends to pray for her.
    Some members of the study group invited Larisa to evangelis-
tic meetings being held in nearby Tashkent. She went with them
 and felt the Holy Spirit touch her heart. She responded to the call
 to follow Christ. Later when she returned to the doctor, her blood
 tests came back negative. God had not only healed her soul, but
 her body as well.
     Larisa accepted God's call to study theology, and today she
 serves as women's ministries director in a largely Muslim region
 of the former Soviet Union. Many of the church's converts in this
 area are young people who have been shunned by their families
 when they became Christians. Larisa understands their needs, and
 she can testify that "God shall provide," for He has proven that to
 her.

          The Heavenly Family




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 24:29-44; 2 Cor. 5:1;
Rom. 8:18-23; Rev. 21:1-5; 22:1-5; Isa. 65:17-25.

   MEMORY TEXT: "For our citizenship is in heaven, from which
   we also eagerly wait for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ"
   (Philippians 3:20, NKJV).

   KEY QUESTIONS: What must the church do to prepare for Christ's
second coming? What must we as individuals do? How will the antici-
pation of the Second Coming motivate our decisions and the way we live?

   "WE SHALL ALWAYS BE WITH THE LORD" (1 Thess.
4:17, NKJV). The first lesson of this quarter had to do with the family
that God has on this earth. What a blessing to belong to this family and
have a loving Father who cares for us and gives us "all His benefits"!
(Ps. 103:2).
     In this last lesson, we will consider the glorious condition of this
family in heaven. "Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered
into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who
love Him" (1 Cor. 2:9).
   The anticipation of such joyous and glorious union with the Re-
deemer and the redeemed should fill us with hope and courage in the
present. It should fill us with gratitude that soon we will join our
heavenly family and become citizens of God's country for eternity.
   This is a unique time! What a privilege it is to live during this hour
of history, to prepare for eternity.

CITIZENS OF A NEW COMMUNITY (Phil. 3:20, 21; 2 Cor. 5:1).

   What does Paul say about our true citizenship? Phil. 3:20.


   This earth, contaminated with sin and wickedness, is not our true
home. The Lord has promised us "new heavens and a new earth in
which righteousness dwells" (2 Pet. 3:13). Clearly, the present condi-
tion of this world shows us that we are near the end of all human
sorrows. The day is coming when everything will become new for-
ever. Even today we see many signs announcing that the "new earth"
is near.
   "The Christian needs a constant awareness of the fact that he is a
citizen of heaven. Attachment to one's country leads him to be loyal
to it. Wherever he may be living he will conduct himself in a way that
will honor the good name of his country. Keeping in mind the kind of
life we expect to live in heaven, serves to guide us in our life on earth.
The purity, humility, gentleness, and love we anticipate experiencing
in the life to come may be demonstrated here below. Our actions
should disclose that we are citizens of heaven. Our association with
others should make heaven attractive to them."—SDA Bible Commen-
tary, vol. 7, p. 172.

  Why does Paul compare our earthly body to a tent and the
body we will have in heaven to a "building from God, a house not
made with hands, eternal in the heavens"? 2 Cor. 5:1.


   Himself a tentmaker, Paul makes an accurate illustration of our
earthly body. Just as a tent is made of earthly materials, so is the body.
Just as a tent is a temporary dwelling, so is the body. And just as a tent
can be easily destroyed, so can the body.
   In John 1:14, we read that "the Word became flesh and dwelt
among us" (NKJV). The original word translated "dwelt" literally
means "tented" among us.
   Peter also compares our earthly body to a tent in 2 Peter 1:13, 14:
"Yes, I think it is right as long as I am in this tent, to stir you up by
reminding you, knowing that shortly I must put off my tent, just as our
Lord Jesus Christ showed me" (NKJV).

    As our body grows older or becomes diseased, we become
 increasingly conscious of how wonderful it will be to have "a
 building from God, a house not made with hands . . . " (2 Cor.
5:1, NKJV). What about this "building" from God will you be
 most grateful for?

                                                                      105

WAITING FOR THE ETERNAL DAY (Rom. 8:18-23; Heb. 10:35-
37).

   Why do we "groan within ourselves" (NKJV) in relation to the
day of our salvation? Rom. 8:18-23. What phrases in these verses
highlight the deep longing Christians have to regain the original
perfection of humankind and creation?


   The Lord knows our needs and longings. For this reason He does
not want to delay His coming. The promise says, "He will finish the
work and cut it short, . . . the Lord will make a short work upon the
earth" (Rom. 9:28).

   Earnest expectation (Rom. 8:19). The original word for this phrase
means "awaiting with the head outstretched." The prefix of the origi-
nal word means "away," and implies "a turning away from all else and
a fixing of the eyes upon a single object. It suggests waiting with
the head raised and the eye fixed on that point of the horizon from
which the expected object is to come."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol.
6, p. 569.

   Groans (Rom. 8:19, 23). Just as an expectant mother groans with
labor pains yet joyfully anticipates the delivery of her child, so Chris-
tians joyfully anticipate being delivered to heaven even as they groan
with physical and spiritual pain inflicted upon them by sin.

  What does God promise about the Second Coming of Christ?
Heb. 10:35-38. Coupled with the subject of the Second Coming,
what is the significance of verse 38?

   What assurance! We do not need to say, "My master is delaying his
coming" (Matt. 24:48, NKJV). "The Lord is not slack concerning His
promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not
willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance"
(2 Pet. 3:9). We can be sure that Christ would like to come as soon as
possible. The delay is not His. It is ours!
   "For forty years did unbelief, murmuring, and rebellion shut out
ancient Israel from the land of Canaan. The same sins have delayed
the entrance of modern Israel into the heavenly Canaan. In neither
case were the promises of God at fault. It is the unbelief, the worldli-
ness, unconsecration, and strife among the Lord's professed people
that have kept us in this world of sin and sorrow so many years."
—Last Day Events, p. 38.

PERFECT HEALTH, PERFECT JOY (Isa. 35:5-10; Rev. 21:1-5).

  Summarize how Isaiah 35:5-10 describes the wonders of the
new earth in regards to humans, nature, and activities.


  humans



  nature



  activities



   "The eyes of the blind. This promise will be true both literally and
figuratively. Men who are spiritually blind . . . will have the eyes of
their spiritual vision opened and the ears of their moral understanding
unstopped. In the earth made new all physical infirmities will likewise
be healed."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 232.

  What did John see and hear in vision regarding the new earth?
Rev. 21:1-5; 22:1-5.


   Can we even imagine a life so perfect and joyful? Even the best we
have now is less than a pallid reflection of what we shall have then.
   But by far the best of all is that "the throne of God and of the Lamb
shall be" there. And we "shall see His face, and His name shall be on
their [our] foreheads" (22:4). The very Savior who taught, healed, and
preached in Palestine; the very Lamb of God who gave His life for our
salvation will be with us. And we shall be with Him for eternity! In
His holy hands we shall see the signs of His sacrifice on the cross.
And we will shout, "Alleluia! For the Lord God Omnipotent reigns!"
(Rev. 19:6, NKJV).

    Read Revelation 21:1-5 and 22:1-5 again. As you do, imagine
 that you are seeing what John saw. What do you see, hear, smell,
 feel, and sense? How does it all contrast to what you have on this
 earth? By God's grace, determine that absolutely nothing will
 deprive you of this glorious inheritance.


                                                                    107

HOLY AMNESIA (Isa. 65:17-25).

  How does Isaiah 65:17-25 describe other aspects of the new
heaven and earth?


   In these verses, Isaiah describes what things would have been like
on earth for Israel if they had obeyed the messages of the prophets and
fulfilled the mission to which God had called them. (See SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 4, pp. 38, 332.) But because they failed, this de-
scription failed to occur. When viewed accordingly, certain verses in
this passage cease to be a problem, and we can view it in light of its
secondary application—a description of the new heaven and the new
earth after Christ returns.
   "We are homeward bound. He who loved us so much as to die for
us hath builded for us a city. The New Jerusalem is our place of rest.
There will be no sadness in the City of God. No wail of sorrow, no
dirge of crushed hopes and buried affections, will evermore be heard.
Soon the garments of heaviness will be changed for the wedding
garment. Soon we shall witness the coronation of our King." —The
Adventist Home, pp. 542, 543.

  "Days of a tree. A tree is a symbol of fixity and permanence.
Compare ch. 40:6 [Isa.].

   "Work of their hands. Life in the new earth will not be an idle
existence. Men will labor and they will enjoy the fruits of their labors.
Work there will be a comfort and a source of endless delight. The
saints will plan homes and gardens and they will have the time and the
means to carry out their plans."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p.
334.
   "All the perplexities of life's experience will then be made plain.
Where to us have appeared only confusion and disappointment, bro-
ken purposes and thwarted plans, will be seen a grand, overruling,
victorious purpose, a divine harmony."—Education, p. 305.

   Think about some of the perplexities you have faced and are
facing now. Does it seem impossible now to view them as part of "a
grand, overruling, victorious purpose"?


   How can you view from God's perspective the many perplexi-
ties and trials that beset you? What difference does this make in
your daily life?

CERTAINLY JESUS IS COMING (Matt. 24:29-44; 25:1-13; James
5:7, 8).

   Explain what Jesus said about the signs of His coming and our
preparation for that day. Matt. 24:29-44. What is the recurring
theme of the chapter? Which one of these verses best summarizes
that theme?


   Will be taken (v. 40). The teaching of the "secret rapture" is based
on this verse. This teaching states that "the saints are to be secretly
snatched away from this earth prior to the visible return of Christ. . . .
But these verses teach no such thing. The "coming" of ch. 24 is
always, without exception, the literal, visible appearance of Christ
(see vs. 3, 27, 30, 39, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50).
   "What Jesus meant by being 'taken' and by being 'left' is made
clear by the context. Those who are left are the evil servants, who
instead of continuing in their normal pursuits after a supposed secret
rapture, are cut asunder and assigned their portion with the hypocrites
(vs. 48-51)."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 504.

   Jesus emphasized the recurring theme of chapter 24 with two
parables. Read the second one in Matthew 25:1-13. What do the
following elements of the parable symbolize? (a) the five wise
virgins; (b) the five foolish virgins; (c) the bridegroom; (d) the
lamps; (e) the oil; (f) the time of waiting; (g) the arrival of the
bridegroom; (h) midnight; (i) the light from the oil.


   "Three of the saddest sayings in the parables of Jesus are found
here: (1) 'Our lamps are gone out'; (2) 'The door was shut ; and (3) 'I
do not know you.' This is illustrative of God's judgment which is
unequivocal and irreversible. We cannot know Christian assurance
without the Spirit (illustrated by the oil), and we cannot succeed on
borrowed religion."—Augsburger, The Communicator's Commentary,
pp. 278, 279.

    To prevent accidents, captains of overseas ships will relin-
 quish their stations to a harbor pilot as they approach their
 destination. Their ships also will fly a flag announcing, "Harbor
 pilot on board."
    We are near the harbor of eternity. Are you submitted to
 Jesus? Do you have Him, the divine Harbor Pilot, on board to
 secure a safe arrival? How does your behavior tell others that
 Jesus is leading your trip to heaven?

                                                                      109
Friday                                              December 24
FURTHER STUDY: Read Matthew 24:45-51. What does this par-
able teach us about how we should live while we are waiting for Christ
to return?
   Read any or all of the following: the last two chapters of The
Adventist Home; the last two chapters of Last Day Events; the last two
chapters of The Great Controversy; the last chapter of Christ's Object
Lessons.

   "Belief in the near coming of the Son of man in the clouds of
heaven will not cause the true Christian to become neglectful and
careless of the ordinary business of life. The waiting ones who look
for the soon appearing of Christ will not be idle, but diligent in
business. Their work will not be done carelessly and dishonestly, but
with fidelity, promptness, and thoroughness. Those who flatter them-
selves that careless inattention to the things of this life is an evidence
of their spirituality and of their separation from the world are under a
great deception. Their veracity, faithfulness, and integrity are tested
and proved in temporal things. If they are faithful in that which is least
they will be faithful in much."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, p.
309.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How does the "blessed hope" of the Second Coming moti-
     vate us to be more faithful to the Lord?

   2. How is the kingdom of grace working in your heart to make
      you a citizen of the kingdom of glory?

   3. How can we prepare ourselves for heaven? Think of at least
      five ways, and give scriptural references to support your
      idea. One is given here to get you started: Watching and
      praying so we do not enter into temptation (Matt. 24:42;
      26:41).

   4. Contrast the great blessings that will be ours as citizens of
      heaven with the ending that belongs to sinners and nominal
      Christians who are not prepared to meet Jesus at His sec-
      ond coming.

SUMMARY: May the Lord keep us from the evil one, and help us to
be holy. Then, in the day of His coming, we will not say, "The harvest
is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved!" (Jer. 8:20,
NKJV). Instead, we will triumphantly shout, "This is the Lord; we
have waited for Him; we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation"
(Isa. 25:9).

         Below, the Crocodile; Above, the Tiger
                           Scott Griswold

   A man was lost in the jungle when he heard the terrifying roar
of a tiger. The man raced for his life, not daring to stop. Ahead, the
pathway dropped into the river.
   With the tiger nearly upon him, the man leaped for a vine
hanging down from the trees overhead. He clung desperately to it
while the tiger paced back and forth below him. With his heart still
pounding, the man carefully inched down toward the river.
   Suddenly he stopped. What was that noise—a quiet swishing in
the water below? He looked down, and to his horror he saw an
immense crocodile staring hungrily at him. Hand over hand he
pulled himself up the vine and away from the grasp of the crocodile's
jaws, only to see the tiger still watching him. Below, the croco-
dile; above, the tiger!
   His hands burned; he did not know how long he could hold on.
Would the tiger or the crocodile ever go away? He wrapped the
vine around his waist and prepared to wait. Surely they would not
stay forever.
   But in the quiet another sound struck horror in his heart. Two
rats, one black and one white, were gnawing on the vine above his
head. He shouted at the rats, but they did not go away. Now it was
only a matter of time until he and the vine would crash into the
water below.
    So ends this Khmer folk tale that illustrates the inevitability of
death. No one escapes; there is no hope for rescue.
    Thank God that the story does not have to end there! Thank
 God that Jesus came from heaven to rescue us from the jaws of
 hopelessness and certain death through His own death. He did it
"so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of
 death—that is, the devil—and free those who all their lives were
 held in slavery by their fear of death" (Heb. 2:14, 15, NIV).
    Surely the time is short before Christ will return to take His
 children home. How many people have you told, through your
 words, your life, your gifts to mission, that they do not have to
 wait and wonder whether death will come from the crocodile
 below or the tiger above?

   Scott and Julie Griswold are church planting among the Khmer
people in Cambodia. They serve under the auspices of Adventist Frontier
Missions.

    The art and joy of Sabbath keeping is becoming lost. Many find
 that their Sabbath experiences have become either habit-driven
 forms and practices that have lost all meaning or nonsacred play and
