   Educators have long known the power of visual aids. Jesus Himself often
used the objects of the visual world to teach His spiritual lessons effectively.
   Now this tremendous combination of the word spoken and the word seen is
available through the new adult Sabbath School theme videos.
   Professionally produced by the Church Ministries department, these videos
are a special blessing to Sabbath School students, shut-ins, small groups, and
isolated members.
    Available each quarter from your Adventist Book Center.

              So Send I You
              Principles of Soul-Winning

   The great controversy between Christ and Satan began when
Satan accused the Creator of the universe before His subjects
of being unjust and unfair. The great arch-rebel, Lucifer, has
repeated these accusations throughout history, because he sees
in them his best hope of persuading others to join him in
rebellion against God.
   In order for God to disprove these charges against His char-
acter, it is necessary that all His actions in relation to His
subjects be so obviously just that no one will be able to find
anything in them that might sustain Satan's accusations. Be-
cause of His perfectly loving character, God will never bring
judgment upon the earth without giving earth's inhabitants
fair and sufficient warning in advance. For this reason Noah
preached a warning message for 120 years before the Flood
came upon his generation. A host of prophets warned Israel
for many years before the Babylonian captivity. John the Bap-
tist, Jesus, and the apostles brought the gospel and the last
warning message to the Jewish nation before it was finally
judged and rejected as the chosen people of God.
    Today the world is moving rapidly toward the greatest of all
God's judgments, which will bring the terrible history of sin to
its close. In order for the character of God to be vindicated and
all humanity invited to serve Him, a clear message of salvation
and warning must be given to all the world before its probation
is irrevocably ended. We find just that warning message pro-
 phetically described in the testimonies of the three angels of
 Revelation 14:6-12. Here is the "everlasting gospel" in the con-
 text of the judgment and Sabbath messages; a call to repentance
 and godly living, and a call to fellowship with the Creator.
    We recognize that in order for this tremendously important
 message to be given to the world, there must be messengers.
 Who are they? Even though many Christian groups are pre-
 senting some aspects of the everlasting gospel, Seventh-day
 Adventists are committed to proclaiming every feature of that
 gospel as clarified in Scripture. Christ is calling His people to
 share His saving love with every nation, kindred, tongue, and
 people, inviting them to demonstrate living faith in Jesus Christ
 by uniting upon the platform of allegiance to all His com-
 mandments.

      What Did Jesus Teach
        About Mission?



Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: John 4:34-38; Luke 15:1-
24.

    MEMORY TEXT: "Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be
    unto you: as my Father hath sent me, even so send I you"
    (John 20:21).

  KEY THOUGHT: God has commissioned human beings to
share the good news of His saving love.

    WHAT A PRIVILEGE TO COOPERATE WITH JESUS in
His mission of mercy to the world! In Old Testament times,
God chose Noah, Abraham, Moses, Ruth, Esther, Daniel, and
many other humble, dedicated people to give His messages of
salvation and warning. In New Testament times, Christ chose
fishermen, tax collectors, widows, and even people of ques-
tionable reputation, including some who had been violent per-
secutors. Having experienced His saving power, they all be-
came His special ambassadors.
   Today Christ is calling men and women from all walks of
life to join Him in the greatest challenge ever committed to
humankind—the work of spreading the exciting news that, by
accepting Jesus Christ as Saviour and Lord, all may enjoy
eternal life with Him.
   "Everyone in whose heart Christ abides, everyone who will
show forth His love to the world, is a worker together with
God for the blessing of humanity. As he receives from the
Saviour grace to impart to others, from his whole being flows
forth the tide of spiritual life."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 13.

Sunday                                     December 26
THE TIME FOR REAPING HAS COME (John 4:31-38).

  How did Jesus explain to His disciples that they should be
ready at all times to cooperate with God in gathering a great
harvest of souls? John 4:31-38.


   Jesus had just concluded His interview with the woman of
Samaria. The disciples arrived back from the town with food
and offered some to Jesus. But He was no longer hungry or
thirsty. He responded, "I have food to eat that you know
nothing about" (John 4:32, NIV). The divine work of leading a
soul to salvation was food enough for Jesus!
   Then Jesus looked at the nearby fields of grain that in four
months laborers would harvest. He said, "Do you not say,
'Four months more and then the harvest'? I tell you, open your
eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe for harvest" (John
4:35, NIV). As the Samaritans were coming out of the town to
receive Him, Jesus pointed out the readiness of people every-
where to respond to His invitation. The Holy Spirit is much
more operative in human lives than we recognize. He has been
sowing seeds of truth in hearts all over the world. Multitudes
are ready for the Lord to gather them into the kingdom of
grace. If only we would believe Jesus' evaluation of the situa-
tion, we would respond by cooperating with Him in reaping
the harvest.

  What should be our reaction to the spiritual need of the
multitudes around us? Matt. 9:35-38; Luke 10:1-3.


   Jesus could not hide His love for people. When He saw the
crowds that flocked to Him, His heart overflowed with con-
cern. How could they be shepherded? Who was available to
show them the way to God? "'The harvest is plentiful,'" Jesus
said, "'but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest,
therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field'" (Matt.
9:37, 38, NIV).

   It is impossible to pray that God will select and commission
workers to gather in the harvest of souls without our becom-
ing personally convicted of our own responsibility. As we
pray, we need to ask, "Could I be one of the soul-winners
Jesus has in mind? Or perhaps I have means or talents that will
facilitate the sending of laborers into the harvest field."

                                                              7
Monday                                         December 27
COMPASSION FOR OTHERS (Luke 15:1-24).
   How did Jesus illustrate the various means He uses in
leading people to respond to His love? Luke 15:1-24.

    The lost sheep knows it is lost, but cannot release itself from
the brambles and vines in which it has become entangled. But
with an aching heart, Jesus goes out into the darkness of this
sinful world seeking that lost one (Luke 15:3, 4). And when He
finds it, He tenderly carries it back to the safety of the sheepfold.
Does our love for unsaved people inspire us to join Jesus in His
search?
    The coin is an inert piece of money with no awareness that it
is lost (Luke 15:8). So millions are totally absorbed in the secu-
lar world with no awareness of their need. Jesus searches long-
ingly for them, and when He finds them, He invites the angels
of heaven to rejoice with Him. Are we searching with Him for
these precious lost ones?
    The lost son knew that he was lost and was able to respond
to Christ's conviction that he should return home. "He came to
his senses" (Luke 15:17, NIV), decided to go home (verse 18),
and acted on his decision (verse 20). Are we moved with com-
passion to join the Father in meeting the returning sinner a
long way off (verse 20)?
   What kinds of danger are Christ's true followers willing
to risk when filled with compassion for the lost? Matt. 10:16-
20.

   Arrest, beating, trial, and imprisonment are only part of the
ordeal Jesus' followers have been asked to endure. They may
have to face family disunity and disloyalty (Matt. 10:21, 34-36).
They may be confronted by the hatred of those who reject their
message (verse 21), and even by attempts to take their lives
(verses 28-30). But as they witness to others, there is always the
comforting assurance of Jesus' protecting presence (verses 29-
31), His merciful intercession for them in heaven (verse 32),
and His ultimate gift of eternal salvation (verse 22).
   "So send I you—My strength to know in weakness,
   My joy in grief, My perfect peace in pain."
                             —SDA Hymnal, No. 578
Tuesday                                      December 28
PERSONAL MINISTRY (Matt. 25:31-46).

   For what kinds of ministry to others will Jesus finally
commend those whom He takes to His kingdom? Matt.
25:34-36. Why do you think the saved will not be aware that
they have done anything worthy of commendation? Matt.
25:37-40.


    Salvation is not by works; it is by Christ's grace alone (Eph.
2:8, 9). But to experience salvation by grace is inevitably to be
motivated by an earnest longing to see others enjoying the
same blessing. (See Eph. 2:10.) Supplying the material needs of
the hungry and thirsty, sheltering the homeless, clothing the
poor, caring for the sick, and ministering to those in prison
(Matt. 25:35, 36) are practical ways in which we unconsciously
give evidence of the saving effectiveness of Christ's grace in
our hearts. Jesus did not teach that relieving material needs
and social ills is the sum total of our outreach for others. Our
practical ministry enables us to "preach good news to the poor
. . . to proclaim freedom for the prisoners . . . to release the
oppressed" (Luke 4:18, NIV). The path to the heart of those
being crushed by life's burdens is carved by loving ministry.

  What does emulating the good Samaritan have to do with
winning souls to Christ? What is the relationship between
performing kind deeds and the task of proclaiming the
Second Advent message? Luke 10:29-37.


  Jesus was illustrating the command of Leviticus 19:18: "Love
your neighbor as yourself" (NIV). If you were attacked, robbed,
and left half-dead, wouldn't you respond positively to the one
who risked his life, ignoring the prejudices of his race against
yours and ministering unselfishly to your need? When you
were well again, wouldn't you visit him and pour out your
thanks for his saving your life? Wouldn't you want to know
something of his motivation? Wouldn't you ask about his reli-
gious convictions, seek an understanding of his God, and, with
deep gratitude, endeavor to emulate his love and compassion?

   How would Jesus minister today? through hospital work?
education? street evangelism? foster homes? day-care cen-
ters? Who are those in need today?


                                                                 9
Wednesday                                       December 29
SHARE THE GOOD NEWS (Matt. 24:14).

  What is the good news that the whole world must hear
before Jesus will return? Matt. 24:14; 28:18-20; John 3:16, 17;
Rev. 14:6.


   Jesus' commission to spread the good news of salvation
made possible by the cross is for every member of the church,
not only for preachers.
   "Why is it that many more do not respond to the call [to
work in the Lord's vineyard]? Is it because they think them-
selves excused in that they do not stand in the pulpit? Let them
understand that there is a large work to be done outside the
pulpit by thousands of consecrated lay members.
   "Long has God waited for the spirit of service to take pos-
session of the whole church so that everyone shall be working
for Him according to his ability. When the members of the
church of God do their appointed work in the needy fields at
home and abroad, in fulfillment of the gospel commission, the
whole world will soon be warned and the Lord Jesus will
return to this earth with power and great glory."—The Acts of
the Apostles, p. 111. (See Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 16.)

  Although Christ is drawing everyone to Himself (John
12:32), what kinds of response can we expect from people as
we present the gospel? Matt. 13:3-9, 18-23. Note Jesus' inter-
pretation of the parable:

          PLACE            INTERPRETATION

     Verse 4 "along the path" Verse 19

     Verses 5, 6 "rocky places" Verses 20, 21

     Verse 7 "among thorns" Verse 22

     Verse 8 "good soil" Verse 23

  Jesus' parable encourages those who are sharing the good
news of His saving grace. Jesus never taught that the whole
world will respond positively to His love. The parable of the
sower illustrates that only those whose hearts are represented
by the good soil will become subjects of Christ's kingdom.

RECEIVE AND GIVE (John 21:1-23).

   What lesson did Jesus illustrate for His disciples after His
resurrection? John 21:1-6, 11.


   "Vividly they recalled the scene beside the sea when Jesus
had bidden them follow Him. [See Mark 1:16, 17.] They re-
membered how, at His command, they had launched out into
the deep, and had let down their net, and the catch had been so
abundant as to fill the net, even to breaking. [See Luke 5:4-6.]
Then Jesus had called them to leave their fishing boats, and
had promised to make them fishers of men. It was to bring this
scene to their minds, and to deepen its impression, that He had
again performed the miracle. His act was a renewal of the
commission of the disciples. It showed them that the death of
their Master had not lessened their obligation to do the work
He had assigned them. Though they were to be deprived of
His personal companionship, and of the means of support by
their former employment, the risen Saviour would still have a
care for them. While they were doing His work, He would
provide for their needs. And Jesus had a purpose in bidding
them cast their net on the right side of the ship. On that side He
stood upon the shore. That was the side of faith. If they labored
in connection with Him—His divine power combining with
their human effort—they could not fail of success."—The De-
sire of Ages, pp. 810, 811.

  Are you able to see the relevance to your life of Jesus'
commission to Peter? Explain. John 21:15-23.


   Jesus' call to witness in the command, "Feed my lambs,"
"Feed my sheep," is for every one of us. Like Peter, we have all
been "like sheep going astray" (1 Peter 2:25, NIV). But like
him, we are invited to employ our talents in Christ's saving
mission for a world in sin. Because of Calvary, we can "die to
sins and live for righteousness" (1 Peter 2:24, NIV). We can
take up the cross Christ is laying upon each of us and, con-
sumed by love and compassion, take the gospel to our neigh-
bors.

   Are you willing to commit your mind and body, time,
talents, and service to the Lord Jesus Christ? In what ways do
you believe He can use you in His mission to the world?

                                                                11
Friday                                       December 31
FURTHER STUDY: Study the major aspects of Jesus' message
for the world given in Luke 17:20-25. Read "Go Teach All
Nations," in The Desire of Ages, pp. 818-828.
   "All who consecrate soul, body, and spirit to God will be
constantly receiving a new endowment of physical and mental
power. The inexhaustible supplies of heaven are at their com-
mand. Christ gives them the breath of His own spirit, the life of
His own life. The Holy Spirit puts forth its highest energies to
work in heart and mind. The grace of God enlarges and multi-
plies their faculties, and every perfection of the divine nature
comes to their assistance in the work of saving souls. Through
cooperation with Christ they are complete in Him, and in their
human weakness they are enabled to do the deeds of Omnipo-
tence."—The Desire of Ages, p. 827.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How can sharing the gospel with others be combined
     with personal ministry for their specific needs?
     2. Why do you think some church members are not inter-
        ested in witnessing for Christ?
     3. What would it take for a revival of New Testament
        witnessing to begin in your local church? your commu-
        nity? your home?
     4. How do we need to rearrange our priorities for time,
        work, money, and recreation to be part of a witnessing
        revival?
     5. What things hinder such a revival?
     6. Are you willing for this revival to begin with you?
SUMMARY: Jesus' mission for the world is to involve every
one of His followers. Because the time of reaping has come,
Christ invites us to reach out compassionately to unbelievers
in loving personal ministry. When others know that we care
about them, they will be willing to listen as we share the good
news of salvation through Christ. With Christ's Spirit reigning
in our hearts, we are to present the gospel to the world in

READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Peter 2:5, 9; Rom. 9:24-
26; 12:3-8; Heb. 8:10-13; Mark 3:31-35.

  MEMORY TEXT: "To him who loves us and has freed us
  from our sins by his blood and made us a kingdom, priests
  to his God and Father, to him be glory and dominion for
  ever and ever. Amen" (Revelation 1:5, 6, RSV).

  KEY THOUGHT: Christ's disciples are all those who dem-
onstrate their faith in Him by doing whatever He asks.

   THE MEDIEVAL DISTINCTION BETWEEN CLERGY AND
LAITY is unbiblical. In Scripture, ministers of the Word are
part of God's people (Matt. 1:21; Titus 2:14). Spiritually they are
not separate from or superior to them. During the Middle Ages
the theory developed that priests are a superior spiritual class,
while the laity are the inferior secular class. The lay-person
was to find God through the priest, who could forgive sins,
define doctrine, and interpret the Bible.
   The teachings of the sixteenth-century Reformers did much
to break this unbiblical distinction between clergy and laity.
Nevertheless, it has continued in many Protestant churches.
The result is that church members tend to exalt their pastors as
a spiritually privileged class who are primarily responsible for
soul-winning. This lesson presents the Bible answer to this
attitude.
                                                                 13

COMPANIONS OF CHRIST (1 Peter 2:5, 9).
   Although in Old Testament times the Levites were given
special priestly responsibilities, how did the Lord regard
Israelites in general? Ex. 19:6; Isa. 61:6.

   Israelite priests performed a special ministry in the sanctu-
ary (later the temple) as types or examples of the various
aspects of Christ's ministry in the heavenly sanctuary. But they
were not a spiritually favored class. They too were sinners in
need of atonement and forgiveness. (See Lev. 4:1-12.) The Lord,
not the priest, forgave sin. (See Lev. 4:31, 35.) The mediatorial
role of Israelite priests was no substitute for direct fellowship
between God and the individual sinner.
   Moreover, the Levitical priests were part of "a kingdom of
priests and a holy nation" (Ex. 19:6, RSV). Every Israelite was
to be a priest—a spiritually pure servant of God, committed to
unselfish service within Israel and faithful witness to alien
peoples. (See Isa. 43:10, 12.)
   In the New Testament church, every believer has a priestly
function. (See Rev. 1:6; 1 Peter 2:5, 9.) A priest is humanity's
representative before God, and God's representative before
humanity. A priest shares God's love with others. Whether in
the home, the workplace, or the church, every Christian be-
liever has priestly responsibilities. By His death and heavenly
mediation, Jesus has freed us from our sins (Rev. 1:5). Now He
calls us to be His companions in service. The Father and the
Son live within us by the Holy Spirit (John 14:18, 23). Hence,
we are able to represent Christ and the Father to others. We
are each to be a living part of Christ's spiritual house, the
church.
   Ordained clergy are part of this spiritual house (Titus 1:1-9;
2:14; 1 Tim. 3:1-12). But they are by no means the whole house.
As the Old Testament priests had a specialized ministry within
the people of God, so do Christian pastors or elders—a some-
what different ministry, but nonetheless specialized. Even so,
their ministry involves facilitating the various roles of other
church members, not superseding them.
   In what practical ways are you able to fulfill your priestly
roles in the home, the workplace, and the church?

WHO ARE GOD'S PEOPLE? (Rom. 9:24-26).
   Both Old and New Testaments include the clergy among
God's people. There is no distinction between clergy (reli-
gious) and people (secular). Kittel's Theological Dictionary of the
New Testament points out that in the New Testament "the Figu-
rative Meaning of laos [people] = the Christian Community."
—Vol. IV, p. 54. The Christian community includes both minis-
ters and church members.
  Note who were included among God's "people" as the
word is used in the Old Testament:
   Ex. 19:4-8
   Deut. 7:6-11
   Deut. 21:9
   Jer. 11:4
  God's people were the object of His special concern, not
because they were more worthy than others, but because, as
believers in Him, they were chosen to represent His loving
character to other nations. "My people" throughout the Old
Testament are leaders, priests, and citizens.
   Who are God's people in the New Testament?
   Matt. 1:21
   Acts 15:14
   Rom. 9:24-26
   Rom. 15:9-13
  Christ's people are Christian believers in general, including
ordained elders and pastors. (See 2 Cor. 6:16.) Christ "gave
himself for us to redeem us from all iniquity and to purify for
himself a people of his own who are zealous for good deeds"
(Titus 2:14, RSV).
   How should the fact that both church members and pastors are
part of the same "royal priesthood" (1 Peter 2:9) influence their
attitudes to one another and to nonbelievers?
                                                                 15

THE SAME COVENANT FOR ALL (Heb. 8:10-13).
  What was the heart of the covenant God made with
Abraham? Gen. 15:6; Rom. 4:1-11; Gal. 3:6-14.

   Abraham entered into the experience of righteousness and
salvation by faith in the Messiah to come. This same covenant
with God was to be the experience of all Abraham's descend-
ants, priests and people alike: "I will establish my covenant
between me and you and your descendants after you through-
out their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to
you and to your descendants after you" (Gen. 17:7, RSV). God
commanded the same covenant "for a thousand generations"
(1 Chron. 16:15-17, RSV).
   At Sinai, God offered His people the same covenant terms
that He had offered Abraham. (Compare Ex. 19:5, 6 with Gal.
3:15-17.) But they attempted to serve God in their own strength.
The result was spiritual failure and moral disaster. (See Ex.
19:8; 24:3, 7; Exodus 32.) Thus they perverted God's "everlast-
ing covenant." God speaks of the "old covenant" at Sinai, not
because He gave anything faulty, but because His people re-
sponded in a faulty way. (Compare Gal. 4:22-31.)
  What are the blessings of the covenant that God wishes to
enter into with His people today? Compare Jer. 31:31-34;
Heb. 8:8-13.

   Christ presents all His people with the same terms—right-
eousness and salvation by faith in Jesus Christ. This spiritual
experience is for church members and pastors alike. Clergy
have no more opportunity of salvation than other believers. To
have sins forgiven and God's law written on the heart by the
Holy Spirit is the privilege of every believer in Jesus Christ.
(See also Rom. 10:6-10.)
   Spiritual privilege involves spiritual responsibility. Because
believers are to receive from Christ the glory of His presence
in their hearts, they have the privilege of sharing Him with
others. "You receivedwithout paying, give without pay" (Matt.
10:8, RSV).
   Have you entered into a covenant relationship with Christ?
By what kind of ministry to others can you share this fellow-
ship?

ONE BODY—DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS (Rom. 12:3-8).

   How does Paul illustrate the different functions of be-
lievers within the Christian church? Rom. 12:3-8.


   Notice that Paul's counsel in this passage is addressed to
"every one among you" (Rom. 12:3, RSV). The "one body in
Christ" (verse 5) is the entire church, including every member
with his or her particular talents and spiritual gifts. Whatever
those gifts, they are to contribute to the health of the "body."
God calls every believer to recognize his or her individual
privilege and responsibility as part of Christ's "body."
   "It is not the Lord's purpose that ministers should be left to
do the greatest part of the work of sowing the seeds of truth.
Men who are not called to the ministry are to be encouraged to
labor for the Master according to their several ability. Hun-
dreds of men and women now idle could do acceptable serv-
ice. By carrying the truth into the homes of their friends and
neighbors, they could do a great work for the Master."—Chris-
tian Service, p. 67.

   What is a major responsibility of the ordained ministers
of the church? Eph. 4:11-16.


   "The saints" (Eph. 4:12), or believers in Christ, are to be
equipped for the work of ministry by evangelists, pastors, and
teachers. In those parts of the world where this plan has been
most closely followed, church members have become success-
ful soul-winners.
   "It is a fatal mistake to suppose that the work of soulsaving
depends alone upon the ministry. The humble, consecrated
believer upon whom the Master of the vineyard places a bur-
den for souls, is to be given encouragement by the men upon
whom the Lord has laid larger responsibilities. Those who
stand as leaders in the church of God are to realize that the
Saviour's commission is given to all who believe in His name.
God will send forth into His vineyard many who have not
been dedicated to the ministry by the laying on of hands."
—Christian Service, p. 68.

  Do you desire to learn how to win souls? How can you
employ your particular talents in applying the soul-winning
principles taught by evangelists and pastors?

                                                               17

CHRIST'S DISCIPLES ARE HIS FRIENDS (Mark 3:31-35).

     Who are claimed by Christ as His relatives? Mark 3:31-35.


   Jesus loved His family and gave special attention to His
mother. But on this occasion His concern was to emphasize
that, as God, His relationship with His faithful followers tran-
scends His human relationship with members of His family.
Christ's disciples are closer to His heart than any human rela-
tionship can fully illustrate.
   His disciples do His will, but they do not earn the close
relationship that Christ described. Because His Spirit fills their
hearts, they are able to do His will. In union with Christ is the
power for doing the will of God. True disciples of Christ are
saved by grace that empowers them to do the works that He
asks. (See Eph. 2:8-10.)

  What is the basis of Jesus' friendship with His disciples?
John 15:12-17. In this passage, Jesus outlines not only the
basis of His friendship with His disciples, but the work that
He expects His friends to do. Consider how your ministry for
souls will be influenced by Jesus' counsel:

     Verse 12 "Love one another"

     Verse 13 Willingness to die for others

     Verse 14 Willingness to obey Christ's commands

     Verse 15 Receiving knowledge from Jesus

     Verse 16 The commission to bear fruit

     Verse 16 Power in prayer

    Note how the great commission Jesus gave after His resur-
rection relates to the message in John 15. He urged the be-
lievers to "make disciples" (Matt. 28:18, 19, RSV). And they
obeyed Him. (See Acts 2:41-47.)

  Identify the ways in which you are demonstrating the
characteristics of a true disciple of Christ. In what ways are
you sharing your friend Jesus with others?

FURTHER STUDY: Study the following passages regarding
discipling: Isa. 8:16; John 13:35; 15:8; Acts 6:7; 11:26. Read "A
Division of Labor" in Gospel Workers, pp. 196-200.

   United work for Christ. "The world will be convinced, not
by what the pulpit teaches, but by what the church lives. The
ministry in the desk announces the theory of the gospel; the
practical piety of the church demonstrates its power. . . .
   "The work of God in this earth can never be finished until
the men and women comprising our church membership rally
to the work, and unite their efforts with those of ministers and
church officers."—Christian Service, pp. 67, 68.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Suppose your church had to share a pastor with 25 or
     more churches as is common in some parts of the world.
     How would you and your fellow church members
     conduct the business of the church, including soul-
     winning ministry?

   2. How are the truths taught in this lesson not a deprecia-
      tion of the pastor's role and authority?

   3. How can church members be soul-winners when they
      are so busy working for economic survival?

   4. If your church depends too much on the pastor for
      spiritual enlightenment and expects him to do most of
      the visiting and soul-winning, how can you help to
      bring about change? What can you do to inspire your
      fellow church members to organize for soul-winning
      ministry?

   SUMMARY: The Bible teaches that every Christian be-
liever is a "priest" with the responsibility of living in fellow-
ship with Jesus and sharing Him with others. The laity is not
spiritually inferior to the clergy. The clergy are part of God's
"people" and subject to the same divine commands. Given the
same covenant relationship with Christ and empowered by
the same divine Spirit, all disciples of Christ—pastors and
church members—are to use their various talents to win
others to Him.

READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Joel 2:23, 28-32; Acts 2:1-
21, 38, 39; 3:19; Rev. 6:9-11; 14:1-5; 18:1.

     MEMORY TEXT: "And after these things I saw another
     angel come down from heaven, having great power; and
     the earth was lightened with his glory" (Revelation 18:1).

  KEY THOUGHT: The spiritual power of the Holy Spirit
enables us to overcome sin, reflect the character of Jesus, and
witness to others of His saving love.

   BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT. Evangelist D. L.
Moody once held up a glass before an audience and asked,
"How can I get the air out of this glass?" One man suggested,
"Suck it out with a pump." But Moody explained that a vacuum
would be created that would shatter the glass. Various other
unsatisfactory suggestions were offered. Finally Moody filled
the glass with water. "There," he said, "all the air is now
removed." Then he went on to explain that spiritual victory is
not achieved by attempting to suck sin out, but by driving it
out by being filled with the Spirit.
   The Bible speaks of the presence of the Holy Spirit in the
hearts of God's people as the power for spiritual victory and
for witnessing to others. The Holy Spirit's presence is as readily
available today as it was on the day of Pentecost. God's final
message to the world will be empowered by an unprecedented
outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon those willing to fulfill the
conditions.

THE PROMISE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT'S POWER (Joel 2:23,
28-32).

   By what means does the Lord plan to revitalize the waning
spiritual forces of His people? Joel 2:23, 28-32.


   In the Middle East the former rain falls in the autumn
(October-November), when the seed is sown. The latter rain
falls in the spring (March-April), ripening the grain for the
harvest. The clause in Joel 2:23 translated by the King James
Version, "He hath given you the former rain moderately,"
may be translated from the Hebrew, "He has given to you the
early rain for righteousness," or "He has given you the
teacher for righteousness."
   The Holy Spirit is the teacher who brings righteousness to
our hearts. (Compare Isa. 32:15-17; Rom. 8:9, 10.) If Joel's
contemporaries had been willing to repent, the Lord would
have given them special spiritual and material blessings. The
land would produce again, and there would be plenty of
grain, wine, and oil. (See Joel 2:24-27.)
   The last phrase of Joel 2:23 translates, "at the first." Verse
28 begins, "And it will be afterward." The second blessing
would come in the distant future from Joel's day when the
spiritual former and latter rains would be poured out with
unprecedented power. The latter-rain outpouring will come
shortly before the second coming of Jesus. (See verses 30-32.)

  Jesus promised that, after His death and resurrection, there
would be a special outpouring of the Spirit upon His faith-
ful, praying people. Note the special blessings the Spirit
brings to the Christian church:

   1. John 14:16-20, 23. His presence is the presence of Christ
      and the Father.
   2. John 14:15, 16, 21-24. He is given to those willing to obey
      Christ's commandments.
   3. John 15:26; 16:13-15. He represents Christ and teaches His
       truth.
   4. John 16:8-11. He convicts of sin, the need for the right-
       eousness of Christ, and the coming judgment.
   5. Luke 24:49; Acts 1:8. He provides spiritual power.

  What evidence do you have that you have received Christ's
promised gift of the Holy Spirit?

                                                               21
Monday                                         January 10
THE FORMER RAIN IN HISTORY (Acts 2:1-21).
   How did the disciples of Jesus prepare for Pentecost? De-
scribe how the promises of Joel and Jesus were fulfilled for
them. Acts 1:14; 2:1-21.

   Jesus' disciples spent the days after His ascension in Bible
study and prayer. They put away their differences and unit-
edly sought the Lord for the power of the Holy Spirit to wit-
ness for Him to all humanity. Their burden was to receive
heaven's qualification for ministry to lost souls.
  Note from Scripture and Ellen White's book The Acts of
the Apostles the results of Pentecost for Jesus' followers and
those to whom they witnessed:
   1. They had love for one another. Acts 2:44-46; 4:32.
   "Every Christian saw in his brother a revelation of divine
love and benevolence. One interest prevailed; one subject of
emulation swallowed up all others. The ambition of the believ-
ers was to reveal the likeness of Christ's character and to labor
for the enlargement of His kingdom."—Page 48.
   2. They proclaimed the gospel with courage and power.
Acts 2:14-42; 4:13, 33. "They [priests and rulers] had thought to
find the apostles cowed with fear under the strong hand of
oppression and murder, but they find them lifted above all
fear and filled with the Spirit, proclaiming with power the
divinity of Jesus of Nazareth."—Page 42.
   3. Thousands were converted. Acts 2:37, 41, 42, 47; 4:4; 5:14;
6:7; 11:21. "The arguments of the apostles alone, though clear
and convincing, would not have removed the prejudice that
had withstood so much evidence. But the Holy Spirit sent the
arguments home to hearts with divine power."—Pages 38, 45.
   4. Spiritual gifts were bestowed. Acts 2:4; 3:6, 7; 6:3-6. "Not
that all the gifts are imparted to each believer. The Spirit di-
vides 'to every man severally as he will.' 1 Cor. 12:11. But the
gifts of the Spirit are promised to every believer according to
his need for the Lord's work."—The Desire of Ages, p. 823.
  Has there been a repetition of Pentecost in your life? your
church? Why? Or, why not?

THE FORMER RAIN IN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE (John 3:5-8).
   What do the following passages teach regarding the work
of the Holy Spirit in our hearts?
  John 3:5-8, 20, 21
  1 Cor. 6:11
  1 Cor. 12:4-7,11
  2 Cor. 3:17,18
  1 John 5:2-5,18
   The work the Holy Spirit accomplishes in the heart of the
repenting sinner is identical to His work for the first disciples
of Jesus. (1) He transforms; (2) He makes holy; (3) He causes
spiritual growth; (4) He gives victory over sin; (5) He imparts
spiritual gifts.
   "In the new birth the heart is brought into harmony with
God, as it is brought into accord with His law. When this
mighty change has taken place in the sinner, he has passed
from death unto life, from sin unto holiness, from transgres-
sion and rebellion to obedience and loyalty."—The Great Con-
troversy, p. 468.
   What seal or guarantee is provided by the Holy Spirit for
the person who accepts Christ as Saviour and Lord? Eph.
1:13, 14 (compare 4:30; 2 Cor. 1:21, 22; 5:5).

   The seal, stamp, or impression made in the heart by the
Holy Spirit's presence is the "earnest" (KJV) or "guarantee"
(RSV) that the believer has the gift of eternal life. (See John
3:36; 5:24; 1 John 5:11-14.) The word translated "guarantee"
(RSV) means "first installment, deposit, pledge," that which
secures a legal claim to something.
   The first seal of the Holy Spirit is equivalent to the former
rain spoken of by Joel and Hosea. (Compare Joel 2:23; Hosea
6:3; 10:12.)
   Is the new-birth experience a once-in-a-lifetime experi-
ence, or should it occur daily? (See Col. 2:6; Gal. 5:16, 25;
2 Cor. 4:16.)

                                                               23

CONDITIONS FOR THE LATTER RAIN (Acts 2:38, 39; 3:19).

   "Unless the former rain has fallen, there will be no life; the
green blade will not spring up. Unless the early showers have
done their work, the latter rain can bring no seed to perfec-
tion."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 506.

  Why is turning away from sin so important to the person
who wants to be a disciple of Christ? Acts 2:38, 39; 3:19.


   Neither the former nor the latter rain can be experienced by
the person who is cherishing sin. Not only does the Holy Spirit
give us initial deliverance from sin; He is the indwelling power
for habitual victory and spiritual growth. Joel's prophecy of
the ultimate outpouring of the Holy Spirit in the latter rain can
be fulfilled only for those who are putting away sin.
   "Not one of us will ever receive the seal of God [the end-
time seal] while our characters have one spot or stain upon
them. It is left with us to remedy the defects in our characters,
to cleanse the soul temple of every defilement. Then the latter
rain will fall upon us as the early rain fell upon the disciples on
the Day of Pentecost."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 214.
   "Those who receive the seal of the living God and are pro-
tected in the time of trouble must reflect the image of Jesus
fully. . . . I saw that none could share the 'refreshing' unless
they obtain the victory over every besetment, over pride, self-
ishness, love of the world, and over every wrong word and
action."—Early Writings, p. 71. (Compare 2 Cor. 7:1; Eph. 4:13;
1 Peter 1:15, 16; Rev. 3:2, 4, 5.)

   What other conditions must we fulfill if we are to have the
latter rain? Zech. 10:1; Acts 1:8; 4:32.


  Joel's prediction for the church will be fulfilled when we are
willing to engage in a unity of prayer and are willing to allow
Christ's power to witness through us.

   "When we have entire, wholehearted consecration to the
service of Christ, God will recognize the fact by an outpour-
ing of His Spirit without measure; but this will not be while
the largest portion of the church are not laborers together
with God."—Christian Service, p. 253.

THE FINAL SEAL AND THE LATTER RAIN (Rev. 14:1-5; 18:1).
  Under what conditions will the Lord come to raise those
who died believing and who have been vindicated in the
pre-Advent judgment? Rev. 6:9-11 (compare Dan. 12:1-3).

   The martyrs under the altar are symbolic of all the dead
who are vindicated in the pre-Advent judgment prior to Jesus'
second coming. The altar symbolizes the altar of burnt offering
in the court of the earthly sanctuary, under which the blood of
the sacrifices was poured. (See Lev. 4:7, 18, 25, 30, 34.) The cry
of the dead is answered by their vindication in the pre-Advent
judgment; metaphorically they are given white robes. They are
to rest a "little longer" (Rev. 6:11, RSV) until something vital
happens for their living brethren and sisters.
   The Greek of Revelation 6:11 does not contain the word
number, nor is that word necessary to the meaning of the pas-
sage. The Greek translates simply: "And there was given to
them each a white robe, and it was said to them that they
should rest a little longer, until their fellow servants and their
brethren who are about to be killed as they were might be made
complete."
    While the Spirit reigns in our hearts, we are complete in
Christ (Col. 2:10), but we tend to choose sin to replace Him as
Lord of our lives (Rom. 6:15, 16).
    "Are we seeking for His fullness, ever pressing toward the
mark set before us—the perfection of His character? When the
Lord's people reach this mark, they will be sealed in their
 foreheads. Filled with the Spirit, they will be complete in
Christ, and the recording angel will declare, 'It is finished."
 —Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p.
1118.
     Note the spiritual condition of those who receive the end-
 time seal of God. Rev. 7:1-3; 14:1-5. By giving us victory over
 sin in the former-rain experience, the Holy Spirit prepares us
 for the end-time seal of God, involving the outpouring of the
 Spirit in latter-rain power. (See Early Writings, p. 71.) Those
 who have this seal have received from the Holy Spirit the gift
 of God's character (Rev. 14:1). "And in their mouth no lie was
 found, for they are spotless" (Rev. 14:5, RSV).
   What do the end-time seal of God and the latter rain have
to do with the finishing of God's work in the earth? See
Friday's lesson.

                                                               25
Friday                                         January 14
FURTHER STUDY: Study Revelation 18:1 in relation to this
lesson. Jesus promised that the Holy Spirit would "testify" of
Him (John 15:26). The Holy Spirit convicts the world "of sin,
and of righteousness, and of judgment" (John 16:8, italics sup-
plied). The "angel" of Revelation 18:1 symbolizes the Holy
Spirit, who enlightens the earth with Christ's righteousness.
By living out Christ's life through His people and empowering
them to take heaven's final message to the world, the Spirit
will enlighten the world with Christ's glory.
    "The angel who unites in the proclamation of the third
angel's message is to lighten the whole earth with this glory.
. . . The work will be similar to that of the Day of Pentecost. As
the 'former rain' was given, in the outpouring of the Holy
Spirit at the opening of the gospel, to cause the upspringing of
the precious seed, so the 'latter rain' will be given at its close
for the ripening of the harvest."—The Great Controversy, p.
611.
    Note the experience of God's Spirit-filled people before the
close of probation, as described in Early Writings, pp. 270, 271:
    1. "The company of guardian angels around them had
been doubled, and they were clothed with an armor from
their head to their feet."
    2. "They had obtained the victory, and it called forth from
them the deepest gratitude and holy, sacred joy."
    3. "Evil angels still pressed around them, but could have
no power over them."
    4. "I heard those clothed with the armor speak forth the
truth with great power. It had effect. Many had been bound;
some wives by their husbands, and some children by their
parents. The honest who had been prevented from hearing the
truth now eagerly laid hold upon it. All fear of their relatives
was gone, and the truth alone was exalted to them. They had
been hungering and thirsting for truth; it was dearer and
more precious than life. I asked what had made this great
change. An angel answered, 'It is the latter rain, the refreshing
from the presence of the Lord, the loud cry of the third
angel.'"

SUMMARY: The former and latter rains symbolize (1) the
outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost and (2)
the end-time outpouring of the Spirit before Jesus comes. The
constant infilling of the Spirit in the former rain enables be-
lievers to witness for Christ, and it prepares them to receive
the latter rain as the power to finish God's work in the earth
before the second coming of Jesus.

            How Did Jesus
             Win Souls?




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: John 3:1-21; 4:1-42; Luke
8:1, 2; 18:18-30; Matt. 10:7, 8.

  MEMORY TEXT: "Jesus answered him, 'Very truly, I tell
  you, no one can see the kingdom of God without being born
  from above" (John 3:3, NRSV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Jesus' soul-winning ministry was not con-
fined to public preaching. Much of His ministry was devoted
to direct appeals to individuals. The master of the personal
interview, Jesus demonstrated for us how to influence others
to respond to His love.

   INTRODUCE OTHERS TO JESUS. A pastor was having
Bible studies with two young men. Their mother was a church
member, but their father was not. Invited to join the Bible
studies, he refused on the ground that he had too many unan-
swerable questions. When his sons were having their Bible
study, he sat reading the newspaper in the same room. One
evening, the pastor invited the young men to give their hearts
to Jesus and to be baptized. Folding his newspaper, their father
listened quietly as they agreed. Impressed to appeal to the
father also, the pastor said, "How beautiful it would be if you
would be baptized with your sons. I want to invite you to be
baptized." The father responded, "I would like that." His ques-
tions had vanished as he listened week by week and caught a
vision of Jesus. As we cooperate with Jesus, following His
methods, He touches hearts and draws people to Himself.

JESUS APPEALED TO THE HEART (John 3:1-21).

   As you study Jesus' interview with Nicodemus, recorded
in John 3:1-21, what three major truths do you find Jesus
emphasized? From this passage analyze Jesus' method of
appealing to an individual heart.


   Consider the kind of person with whom Jesus was speaking.
Nicodemus was (1) a Pharisee; (2) a ruler of the Jews, a mem-
ber of the Sanhedrin. Therefore, Jesus could expect that
Nicodemus was convinced that salvation was obtained through
the performance of good works. He could also expect that,
even if Nicodemus were impressed with His teaching and
healing ministry, he would have deep doubts based on Phari-
saic ideas of the Messiah and His work.
   Notice that, although Nicodemus' opening statement im-
plied doubt about Jesus' Messiahship, Jesus did not attempt to
argue the point. He went right to the heart of Nicodemus'
spiritual need. Nicodemus needed to be born from above—
transformed by the Holy Spirit. Only by that means could he
experience salvation and enter the kingdom of God. Thrown
off balance, Nicodemus expressed doubt about the possibility
of new birth. But Jesus did not stop to argue. He quietly ex-
plained the invisible, transforming work of the Holy Spirit.
(See verses 6-8.)
   Next, Jesus explained why it is possible for the Holy Spirit
to change hearts. The cross makes it possible for any believer
to be born again and to receive the gift of eternal life. (See
verses 13-18.)
   Third, Jesus underlined the importance of works "wrought
in God" (verse 21, RSV). The cross makes it possible for be-
lievers to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, resulting in works
acceptable in God's sight.
   Four principles for soul-winners emerge from the passage:
(1) Be aware of the person's background; (2) speak directly to
the heart's need; (3) don't become involved in argument; (4)
present the cross and its results for the believer—the gift of the
Holy Spirit and a manner of life approved by God.

   Did Jesus succeed in winning the allegiance of Nicodemus?
What does the record reveal about Nicodemus' later attitudes
and commitments? John 7:50-52; 19:39, 40. What lesson for
soul-winners is emphasized by Nicodemus' belated response
to Jesus' heart appeal?

JESUS CREATED A THIRST FOR SALVATION (John 4:1-42).
   Answer the following questions regarding Jesus' inter-
view with the woman of Samaria:
   How did Jesus arrest her attention? John 4:7-9.

  How did Jesus foster her interest? Verses 10-12.

  How did Jesus give her a desire for the water of life?
Verses 13-15.

  How did Jesus bring conviction to her heart? Verses 16-24.

  How did Jesus inspire her to action? Verses 25-29.

   Attention, interest, desire, conviction, action are the five
responses Jesus sought from the woman of Samaria. We can
follow His method, cooperating with the Holy Spirit, who
engenders these five responses.
   "The worker for Christ should not feel that he cannot speak
with the same earnestness to a few hearers as to a larger com-
pany. There may be only one to hear the message; but who can
tell how far-reaching will be its influence? It seemed a small
matter, even to His disciples, for the Saviour to spend His time
upon a woman of Samaria. But He reasoned more earnestly
and eloquently with her than with kings, councilors, or high
priests."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 194, 195.
  What were the immediate results of Jesus' witness to the
woman of Samaria? John 4:28-30, 39-42.

   Like the ripple created by a stone cast into a lake, so the
ripple effect of faithful witness to one person can result in
many others finding the Saviour. The Samaritans gathered
about Jesus and learned for themselves that He was the
Messiah and their Saviour from sin.
  What results have you seen from your tactful, earnest wit-
ness to one person?

                                                              29

JESUS RESTORED GROSS SINNERS (Luke 8:1, 2).
 What special ministry did Jesus perform for Mary
Magdalene? Luke 8:1, 2; 10:38-42.

   The Desire of Ages identifies Mary the sister of Martha and
Lazarus with Mary Magdalene (see pp. 559, 568). In her home
town, Bethany, a Pharisee named Simon led her into the sin of
immorality. (See The Desire of Ages, p. 566.) Evidently she left
home and went to live in the town of Magdala, near the west-
ern shore of the Sea of Galilee. She responded to Jesus' teach-
ing and joined other women who accompanied Him on His
second Galilean tour.
   "Mary had been looked upon as a great sinner, but Christ
knew the circumstances that had shaped her life. He might
have extinguished every spark of hope in her soul, but He did
not. It was He who had lifted her from despair and ruin. Seven
times she had heard His rebuke of the demons that controlled
her heart and mind. She had heard His strong cries to the
Father in her behalf. She knew how offensive is sin to His
unsullied purity, and in His strength she had overcome."—The
Desire of Ages, p. 568.
   Returning to Bethany, Mary was blessed by Jesus' personal
teaching when He visited her home.
   How did Jesus exonerate Mary's act of anointing His head
with perfume, washing His feet with her tears, and wiping
them with her hair? Matt. 26:6-13; Luke 7:36-50; John 12:1-9.

   Judas objected to Mary's expensive act because of his greed.
Simon the leper, whom Jesus had healed, secretly objected
because she was a notorious sinner. "Simon had led into sin
the woman he now despised."—The Desire of Ages, p. 566. Jesus
defended Mary. Her action would be known worldwide through-
out history. By means of a parable, Jesus demonstrated to
Simon that his sin was greater than hers; and her sins were
forgiven. (To read more about Mary, see the story in John
20:11-18.)
   Have you considered the influence of a judgmental spirit
toward sinners? (Compare Rom. 8:1 with Matt. 7:1-5.) If we
would be instruments in winning souls, we must be willing
to accept with love those for whom Jesus is working.

JESUS WON HEARTS BY HEALING BODIES (Matt. 10:7, 8).

  What kind of ministry did Jesus combine with preaching
and teaching? Matt. 9:35.


   The Greek verb sozo, usually translated "to save," is used a
number of times in the Gospels to mean "to heal." (See Matt.
9:22; Mark 6:56; 10:52; Luke 8:50; 17:19.) The healing ministry
of Jesus is an illustration of His power to save from sin. After
forgiving the sins of the paralytic who was let down through
the roof (Luke 5:18-20), Jesus answered the critical thoughts of
the scribes and Pharisees by asking: "Which is easier, to say,
'Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'?" (Luke
5:23, RSV). He added: "'But that you may know that the Son of
man has authority on earth to forgive sins'—he said to the man
who was paralyzed—'I say to you, rise, take up your bed and
go home.' And immediately he rose before them" (Luke 5:24,
25, RSV). Jesus clearly stated that His act of healing was an
evidence of His power to forgive sins.

  When Jesus sent His disciples out to preach, what else did
He command them to do? Matt. 10:7, 8.


   "On the green hillslopes of Galilee, in the thoroughfares of
travel, by the seashore, in the synagogues, and in every other
place where the sick could be brought to Him, was to be found
His hospital. In every city, every town, every village, through
which He passed, He laid His hands upon the afflicted ones
and healed them. Wherever there were hearts ready to receive
His message, He comforted them with the assurance of their
heavenly Father's love."—The Ministry of Healing, pp. 17, 18.
   "The way in which Christ worked was to preach the word,
and to relieve suffering by miraculous works of healing. But I
am instructed that we cannot now work in this way; for Satan
will exercise his power by working miracles. God's servants
today could not work by means of miracles, because spurious
works of healing, claiming to be divine, will be wrought. . . .
Sanitariums are to be established, and with these institutions
are to be connected workers who will carry forward genuine
medical missionary work. . . . This is the provision the Lord
has made whereby gospel medical missionary work is to be
done for many souls."—Medical Ministry, p. 14.


                                                              31

JESUS' CALL TO SERVICE (Luke 18:18-30).
  Why did Jesus ask the rich young ruler to give up all his
wealth? Luke 18:18-22; Matt. 6:24-34.

   Note the direct manner in which Jesus responded to this
young man. First, Jesus wanted him to recognize that He is the
Messiah (Luke 18:18, 19). Second, He wanted him to under-
stand that, in fact, he had not been observing the command-
ments in a manner acceptable to God. The one thing the young
man lacked was the saving love of Christ in his heart (verses
20-22). If he had been willing to receive Christ without reserva-
tion, he would have been willing also to give up his wealth and
become one of Christ's direct fellow workers. Jesus invited
him, as He had invited His other disciples, "Come, follow me"
(verse 22, RSV). What a privilege he turned down for the sake
of retaining his wealth and worldly influence!
   What principles for winning souls can we glean from this
story?
   1. Jesus did not compromise His integrity for the sake of
      attracting a rich disciple. It would have been so easy for
      Jesus to regard the young ruler's money and influence as
      a welcome asset to His cause. But this would never have
      saved the young man, and it would have compromised
      the integrity of Christ's mission.
   2. In a direct manner, Jesus attempted to convey to the
      young man the message that love to God and man is the
      very basis of acceptable commandment-keeping and serv-
      ice. Lack of such love in the heart of one who attempts to
      obey His law amounts to legalism.
   3.Jesus was not denying the importance of life's necessities.
      He wanted the young man to recognize that his abundant
      wealth had become his god. Only by relinquishing it in
      an act of total heart surrender to Christ could he have
      eternal life.
   4. Christ seeks colaborers who are willing to sacrifice all for
      the salvation of their fellow human beings. Only as we
      forsake all our idols can we be God's instruments to
      appeal to the hearts of others.
  Does Christ ask everyone to give all their wealth before
entering His service? (Compare Luke 19:8.) Should we be
willing to give all if He should ask us?

FURTHER STUDY: Study John 6 as an example of Jesus' ap-
proach to people who sought Him for the wrong motives.
Notice how, in the process of relating to them, He emphasized
the heart of the gospel. Read "Nicodemus" and "At Jacob's
Well" in The Desire of Ages, pp. 167-177, 183-195.
   Every believer is a missionary. The woman of Samaria
"represents the working of a practical faith in Christ. Every
true disciple is born into the kingdom of God as a missionary.
He who drinks of the living water becomes a fountain of life.
The receiver becomes a giver. The grace of Christ in the soul is
like a spring in the desert, welling up to refresh all, and mak-
ing those who are ready to perish eager to drink of the water of
life."—The Desire of Ages, p. 195.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. When Jesus worked for individuals, did He have any
     more guarantee than we do that His efforts would be
     successful? Why should we give the same attention to
     an apparently unpromising prospect as to one who seems
     ready to receive the truth with enthusiasm?
  2. Didn't Jesus take a risk in carrying on a one-to-one
     conversation with the woman of Samaria? Suppose you
     are witnessing to a person of questionable reputation
     and are criticized by those who think you are keeping
     bad company. How would you handle that?
SUMMARY: Only as we work to win people as Jesus did can
we fulfill His commission. In His private interviews, Jesus
appealed to the person's heart need; He did not stop to argue
theological points; He presented the cross and its results—the
transforming work of the Holy Spirit and the resulting works
that glorify God. Though not every soul responded positively,
Christ's method was faultless.

            Evangelism?

Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: John 1:35-50; 2:1-11; James
1:19; Col. 4:3; Acts 18.

     MEMORY TEXT: "If one falls down, his friend can help
     him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help
     him up!"(Ecclesiastes 4:10, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: "Friendship evangelism is simple, practi-
cal ways to share the language of caring with people around
you—to let them know that God loves them, that hope is not
lost."—Monte Sahlin, Friendship Evangelism (Siloam Springs,
Ark.: Concerned Communications, 1990), p. 6.

   LOVE IN ACTION WINS FRIENDS. A pastor's wife
visited a woman whose kitchen was so dirty and cluttered it
was impossible to see the floor. She offered to help the woman
clean up. She spent the day removing the rubbish and garbage
from the house and washing the floors.
   When the woman's husband came home from work, he
asked, "What happened?" His wife replied, "Well, the Seventh-
day Adventist pastor's wife came and spent the day with me.
She helped me clean the house. She's coming back tomorrow.
She says she'll help me clean every Friday for a while. Besides
that, we're going to learn how to eat different food, and we're
going to church."
   Practical helpfulness led to friendship and Bible studies,
and there came a day when that family was baptized. Kindness
opens hearts to the conviction of the Holy Spirit and to accep-
tance of the truths of God's Word.

WHAT IS FRIENDSHIP EVANGELISM? (John 1:35-50).
   Notice how the number of Jesus' first disciples was in-
creased as friend influenced friend. John 1:35-50.

   Jesus drew two disciples to Himself. One of the two, An-
drew, brought his brother Simon to Jesus. The next day Jesus
also called Philip to follow Him. "Philip, like Andrew and
Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida" (verse 44, NIV). Could
it be that Andrew and Peter had paved the way for Philip to
come to Jesus? Philip contacted his friend Nathanael and ex-
pressed confidence in Jesus (verse 45).
   "This is the pattern throughout the New Testament, from
person to person to person. Today it is called 'networking.'
Networks are the full range of relationships that you have, the
people you talk to every day. This includes the people at the
office or shop where you work, the people you know at the
supermarket or gas station, your neighbors down the street,
your doctor, barber or beautician, optician, mechanic, insur-
ance agent, etc. Maybe you don't know all their names. Many
of them are not active in any religion."—Sahlin, Friendship
Evangelism, pp. 1, 2.
    It is estimated that two-thirds of adult converts come into
the Adventist Church primarily because of the influence of a
friend or relative. There are five steps that people take in
becoming members of the church:
  1. Awareness: They discover that the church exists and learn
     what it stands for.
  2. Interest in spiritual things: Because of circumstances in
     their lives, the Holy Spirit is able to speak to them.
  3. Evaluation: They go to church, to a Bible study, or to an
     evangelistic meeting to see what it is like. In the first few
     minutes they decide whether they are comfortable in the
     situation.
  4. The trial period: The interested person or new believer
     will consciously or unconsciously put the church on trial
     before making a settled commitment.
  5.Adoption into the church: The new member comes to feel
     like an accepted part of the church family.
  Considering the above steps, how would you explain why
some new members did not remain long in your church?

LEARNING TO CARE (John 2:1-11).

   The early chapters of John's Gospel depict Jesus as a deeply
caring person who did all He could to bring happiness to
others and to relieve their suffering.

   How do the following Bible stories indicate Jesus' care for
others? What principles can you draw from these stories that
should guide us in our witnessing for Him?

     John 2:1-11

     John 2:13-21

     John 4:46-54

     John 5:1-18

     John 6:1-15

   Jesus was a social person; He attended a wedding and,
when the hosts were embarrassed because the supply of wine
ran out, He made more from water.
   Jesus drove the greedy merchants out of the temple court,
partly because He was concerned for the poor sinners who
were being financially exploited.
   Moved by compassion, Jesus healed the dying son of a "royal
official" and, thereby, won a convert.
   In the same spirit of concern, Jesus healed an invalid who
had suffered for 38 years.
   Jesus did not send His hearers home without providing for
their physical needs.
   Religion in action. "The world will be convinced, not by
what the pulpit teaches, but by what the church lives. The
minister in the desk announces the theory of the gospel; the
practical piety of the church demonstrates its power."—Testi-
monies, vol. 7, p. 16.
   "Christ's method alone will give true success in reaching
the people. The Saviour mingled with men as one who desired
their good. He showed His sympathy for them, ministered to
their needs, and won their confidence. Then He bade them,
'Follow me.'"—The Ministry of Healing, p. 143.

  Are you following Jesus' method of witnessing in your
church? in your personal relationships with others?

LEARNING TO LISTEN (James 1:19).
   What is one effective way of winning the trust and friend-
ship of other people? James 1:19.

   It is not possible to assist people in bearing their burdens
without being willing to listen to their needs. We often think
of witnessing as verbalizing our beliefs and convictions. But
the beliefs we are sharing at a particular moment may not
meet the immediate needs of the person to whom we are
speaking. We cannot know the most effective approach to that
person's heart unless we are willing to listen to his or her
concerns. Jesus was a good listener and a keen observer of
people's struggles.
   "It takes a lot of patience, faith, time spent on our knees,
time spent in practice and self-discipline to become an instinc-
tive, caring listener. But that's what the Scripture is asking us
to do. The language of ministry is the ability to listen in a
deep, significant way to other people."—Sahlin, Friendship
Evangelism, p. 13.
   Study the practical-godliness emphasis given in Isaiah 58
in the description of true fasting:
Verse 6 "Loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of
   the yoke . . . set the oppressed free and break every yoke"
   (NIV).
Verse 7 "Is it not to share your food with the hungry and to
   provide the poor wanderer with shelter—when you see the
   naked, to clothe him, and not to turn away from your own
   flesh and blood?" (NIV).
Verses 9, 10 "If you do away with the yoke of oppression, with
   the pointing finger and malicious talk, and if you spend
   yourselves on behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of
   the oppressed, then your light will rise in the darkness,
   and your night will become like the noonday" (NIV).
Verses 11-14 The Lord's blessing is for those willing to serve
   others in these ways. "You will be called Repairer of Broken
   Walls, Restorer of Streets with Dwellings" (verse 12, NIV).
   Such service is associated with true Sabbathkeeping (verse
   13), and leads to genuine fellowship with God (verse 14).
   What might your willingness to listen and encourage do
for a suffering person?

LEARNING TO SHARE (Col. 4:3).

   "It may be hard for you to believe that you could be com-
fortable telling someone at your place of work or among your
relatives how they can accept Jesus Christ as their personal
Savior. If you become a caring listener, you will find that those
opportunities come to you. You will not have to go and find
them. If you become a good listener, opportunities will be
thrust upon you when you have to share the Good News of
Christ because people will ask you."—Sahlin, Friendship Evan-
gelism, p. 19.

  When you need an answer to share with someone, from
what source will that answer come? Col. 4:3; Luke 12:12.


   When Paul was a prisoner in Rome, he prayed that God
would open the door for him to witness to others. When our
personal fellowship with Christ is vital and meaningful, we
have something to share. He opens doors for us so that we can
pass on the "good news" of His saving power. Paul wanted to
proclaim "the mystery of Christ." This is the mystery of what
Christ is willing to do now for the individual who accepts His
sacrifice on the cross. This is "the mystery that has been kept
hidden for ages and generations, but is now disclosed to the
saints. To them God has chosen to make known among the
Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery, which is Christ in
you, the hope of glory" (Col. 1:26, 27, NIV).

  How did the Lord answer Paul's prayer? Acts 28:30, 31;
Phil. 4:22.


   "Even in Nero's household, trophies of the cross were won.
From the vile attendants of a viler king were gained converts
who became sons of God. These were not Christians secretly,
but openly. They were not ashamed of their faith. . . . Not by
Paul's sermons, but by his bonds, was the attention of the court
attracted to Christianity. It was as a captive that he broke from
so many souls the bonds that held them in the slavery of
sin."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 463, 464.

  Do you pray for the Lord to open doors for you to share
your faith? What is the heart of the message you share?

THE FRIENDLY, EVANGELISTIC CHURCH (Acts 18:1-4, 7, 8,
19, 24-27).
   Note the instances recorded in Acts 18 of friends influenc-
ing friends for the gospel:
Verses 1-3 Paul made friends with Aquila and Priscilla and
    worked with them.
Verses 7, 8 Paul established a church in the home of his friend
    Titius Justus. That home church attracted Crispus, the syna-
    gogue ruler, and many others.
Verses 19, 24-27 Paul left Priscilla and Aquila in Ephesus. They
    befriended Apollos, took him to their home, and taught
    him about Christ. Apollos moved to Corinth and shared
    the good news that Priscilla and Aquila had given him.
Rom. 16:3-5 Later Priscilla and Aquila moved to Rome and
    established a friendly church in their home.
   In the process by which the knowledge of Christ was taken
from Jerusalem to Rome, friendship-networking was one of
the most important influences.
   How did the apostolic church grow in numbers? Acts 1:15;
2:41-46; 4:4; 5:14.

   What is a friendly church? A friendly church fosters fellow-
ship, sharing with the needy, eating together, Bible study, and
united prayer. A friendly church has small fellowship groups
that draw people into their circle. By fellowshiping in their
homes, the early Christians attracted many new believers. A
friendly church grows because people want to hear about the
faith of friendly people.
   The members of a friendly church focus on outreach to
others in the community; they are not insular and inbred,
unaware of people's needs. They make earnest attempts to
make friends with people in the community around them.
Motivated by Jesus' love for others, they offer services to the
community designed to improve the quality of life of their
neighbors and friends. A friendly church is a Spirit-filled church
that obeys all Jesus' instructions and unselfishly cooperates
with Jesus in relieving human misery.
  How can your local church become a more outgoing, friendly
church? What kind of reorganization is necessary within the
church so that your congregation can have a greater impact
on the people around you?

                                                               39
Friday                                           January 28
FURTHER STUDY: What do these Bible texts tell us about the
kind of caring necessary to touch lives in a powerful way?
     Jer. 31:3
     Song of Sol. 8:7
     1 Cor. 13:8, 13
     Luke 15:11, 20-23, 32
  Read "Caesar's Household" in The Acts of the Apostles, pp.
461-468.
   "He whose heart is fixed to serve God will find opportunity
to witness for Him. Difficulties will be powerless to hinder him
who is determined to seek first the kingdom of God and His
righteousness. In the strength gained by prayer and a study of
the word, he will seek virtue and forsake vice. Looking to
Jesus, the Author and Finisher of the faith, who endured the
contradiction of sinners against Himself, the believer will will-
ingly brave contempt and derision. And help and grace suffi-
cient for every circumstance are promised by Him whose word
is truth. His everlasting arms encircle the soul that turns to
Him for aid. In His care we may rest safely, saying, 'What time
I am afraid, I will trust in thee.' Psalm 56:3. To all who put their
trust in Him, God will fulfill His promise."—The Acts of the
Apostles, p. 467.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Analyze the outreach efforts of your church in the past
     few years. Were they successful? Why, or why not?
     2. Think of your personal impact on the lives of people
        who are not members of the church. Have your words
        and actions been such that others would be drawn to
        your faith and to your church? What improvements could
        you make?
SUMMARY: Friendship evangelism involves friends influ-
encing friends for Christ, friends who in turn influence their
friends. This networking program emulates the method of
soul-winning used by Christ and the apostles.

Lesson 6                         January 30-February 5

       What Is the Most
      Important Decision?




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 11:28-30; 2 Cor. 7:9-
11; 5:17; Ex. 32:26; Luke 12:8.
  MEMORY TEXT: "Come unto me, all ye that labour and
  are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke
  upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in
  heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls" (Matt. 11:28,
  29).
  KEY THOUGHT: When people accept doctrinal and pro-
phetic truth before accepting Christ, they have a new set of
opinions, but their hearts remain unchanged.
  THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISION for every person is
the decision to surrender the life to Christ. There are three
major decisions involved in coming to Jesus for salvation: (1) to
believe in Him as a personal Saviour; (2) to confess past sins
and to trust Christ for power to keep from sin; (3) to serve
Christ in everything.
   We need to know how to help men and women decide for
Christ. In the right manner and at the right time, we must ask
men and women to accept Jesus. Imagine a literature evan-
gelist going from home to home showing his books, telling
people how valuable the books are, but failing to ask for an
order. When we have befriended people and established a
level of trust, we should ask the question "Have you come to
the place in your spiritual journey where you have accepted
Christ as Saviour and Lord?"
                                                              41
Sunday                                        January 30
INVITE SURRENDER TO JESUS (Matt. 11:28-30).
  What is Jesus' comforting promise to all people in every
age, in every culture? Matt. 11:28-30.

   The world is full of people struggling for survival. Many
poor people are so burdened with the need to make a living
and many of the rich are so frustrated with the emptiness and
meaninglessness of their existence that they seek some rem-
edy, some exciting distraction. The popular relief is pleasure
in its many varied forms—sex, alcohol, drugs, entertainment,
fashion. For some people even crime is an attractive distrac-
tion.
   Those "who labor and are heavy laden" (Matt. 11:28, RSV)
are all sinners struggling with the apparently uncontrollable
demands of their fallen nature. Jesus offers relief, and He has
chosen those who have found relief through His power to take
to others the good news of the spiritual rest He offers.
  Note how John emphasized both the importance and re-
sults of believing in Jesus:
   John 1:7-9, 12, 13 Jesus has light for all humanity, and the
light of salvation for those who believe in Him.
  John 3:16, 36; 5:24 The gift of eternal life begins in the here
and now for those who believe in Jesus.
   John 11:25 Even though those who believe in Jesus should
die, Jesus will raise them on the resurrection day.
   John 17:20-23 Jesus wants His believing people to be united
in love so that unbelievers may know that they too are loved
and can have salvation through Christ.
   In some countries of the Orient the statement that many
roads reach to the top of the mountain means that there are
many ways to reach eternal life. Christians reject that idea. The
Bible teaches that there is only one way of salvation—trust in
the Lord Jesus Christ. (See Acts 4:12.)
  How do you feel regarding the responsibility that God has
given every believer to ask others to accept Jesus as their
Saviour? What steps can be taken if a person feels ill at ease
doing this?

Monday                                          January 31
THE NEED FOR REPENTANCE AND CONFESSION (2 Cor.
7:9-11).
   What is repentance? 2 Cor. 7:8-11. From where does the
gift of repentance come? Acts 5:31; 2 Tim. 2:25.

   Repentance is genuine sorrow for sin and turning away
from it. "The Bible does not teach that the sinner must repent
before he can heed the invitation of Christ, 'Come unto me, all
ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.'
Matthew 11:28. It is the virtue that goes forth from Christ, that
leads to genuine repentance. . . . We can no more repent with-
out the Spirit of Christ to awaken the conscience than we can
be pardoned without Christ."—Steps to Christ, p. 26.
   What specific things did David long to experience again as
he prayed for forgiveness? Ps. 32:1, 2; 51:1-14.

   Because Christ is so willing to forgive our sins and, in the
process, transform our lives (1 John 1:9; Isa. 1:16-18), we should
be willing to confess our sins to Him and, when possible, to
ask forgiveness of those we have wronged. "Confession will
not be acceptable to God without sincere repentance and refor-
mation. There must be decided changes in the life; everything
offensive to God must be put away. This will be the result of
genuine sorrow for sin."—Steps to Christ, p. 39. (See Eze. 33:15;
2 Cor. 7:11.)
   Forgiveness through Christ. Acts 13:38, 39 establishes that
forgiveness is available because of Christ's death upon the
cross. Forgiveness is identified with justification. What does
Christ do for us when He forgives our sins? In speaking of His
ministry, Jesus quoted Isaiah 61:1, 2. The Greek of Luke 4:18
may be translated: "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me because
He has anointed Me to preach good news to the poor; He has
sent Me to preach forgiveness (release) to the captives and re-
covering of sight to the blind, to send forth the oppressed in
forgiveness (liberty)." Christ's forgiveness is release from spirit-
ual captivity. (See Eph. 1:7; Col. 1:13, 14; Thoughts From the
Mount of Blessing, p. 114.)
   Our experience of Christ's forgiveness should inspire us
to reach out to others so that they too may have the peace of
knowing that their sins are forgiven.

                                                                 43
Tuesday                                          February 1
LIVING FOR JESUS (2 Cor. 5:17).

  What immediate change occurs in the lives of those who
surrender to Christ? 2 Cor. 5:17, 21; 1 John 2:29; 3:7.


   Christ forgives their sins and credits their account with His
perfect righteousness (Rom. 4:22-25.) As part of God's saving
act, the righteousness of Jesus is also bestowed upon the be-
liever by the Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:9, 10). Born-again Christians
are able to do works that in God's sight are righteous because
they have received the gift of Christ's righteousness (1 John
2:29). Even though they remain fallen human beings with ten-
dencies toward sin (1 Cor. 9:27; Gal. 5:17), they are now walk-
ing by the Spirit (Gal. 5:16) and are "led by the Spirit" (verse
18, RSV). Christ is living out His life through them (Gal. 2:20).
In this sense they are "righteous, as he is righteous" (1 John 3:7,
RSV).

  When we truly love Jesus, what will be our response to
His will, as expressed in His law? John 14:15; Rom. 8:1-4.


   "The condition of eternal life is now just what it always has
been—just what it was in Paradise before the fall of our first
parents—perfect obedience to the law of God, perfect right-
eousness. . . .
   "We have no righteousness of our own with which to meet
the claims of the law of God. But Christ has made a way of
escape for us. . . . If you give yourself to Him, and accept Him
as your Saviour, then, sinful as your life may have been, for
His sake you are accounted righteous. Christ's character stands
in place of your character, and you are accepted before God
just as if you had not sinned.
   "More than this, Christ changes the heart. He abides in your
heart by faith. You are to maintain this connection with Christ
by faith and the continual surrender of your will to Him; and
so long as you do this, He will work in you to will and to do
according to His good pleasure."—Steps to Christ, pp. 62, 63.

  Are you able to explain the simple steps in the salvation
process to an interested person? Perhaps it would help to
practice on your fellow Sabbath School class members or
individually with a family member or a friend.

Wednesday                                     February 2
A CALL FOR DECISION (Ex. 32:26).
  What decisive question did Moses ask after Israel had
turned from the Lord by making a golden calf and dancing
around it? Ex. 32:26.

   A crisis had come in the camp of Israel. The people were
practicing the lifestyle of the Egyptians. Men and women to-
day are absorbed with the things of the world. The pull of
traditional religions, of secular life, and of worldly attach-
ments and pleasures is so strong that many find it difficult to
place faith in Christ. The question needs to be asked "Who is
on the Lord's side?"
  Study other calls for decision and their results:
Joshua 24:14,15, 24-28
1 Kings 18:21, 38, 39
Acts 2:36-41
Acts 26:25-29
   As Christ's representatives, we are presenting the Elijah
message today (Mal. 4:5, 6), calling men and women to leave
the Baal worship of their culture and generation and to follow
the true and living God. In every relationship with a nonbe-
liever the time comes when we must appeal for a decision.
   If we urge too strongly for a decision before the person is
ready, we run the risk of closing the door on a potential be-
liever. On the other hand, if the person is ready to make a
decision, and we fail to sense it and ask for it, the crucial
moment may go by and the person may not be as receptive
again. Because a person is not asked to join the body of Christ,
he or she may feel not wanted or "not good enough." To be
sensitive to the readiness of a soul requires listening carefully
to the individual and listening prayerfully for the promptings
of the Holy Spirit.
  How can you be sure you are asking for decisions in the
correct manner? Analyze the factors that lead people to make
positive decisions. Apply these factors to decisions for Christ.


                                                               45
Thursday                                        February 3
CONFESSING CHRIST (Luke 12:8).

   What encouragement are we given to let others know about
our faith in Christ and to invite them to accept Him? Rom.
10:9; 1 John 4:13-16.


   Paul links salvation with heart response to Christ and ver-
bal acknowledgment that He is our Lord. John sees a close
relationship between the Holy Spirit living in our hearts and
our willingness to testify to Christ's deity and to rely upon His
love. How important, then, that daily we make the right deci-
sion for Christ and cooperate with Him in inspiring others to
accept Him.
   How do we ask for decisions? After our relationship has
become one of mutual trust and confidence, we may ask, "May
I ask you a question?" They will say yes. The question is "Have
you accepted Jesus as your Saviour and Lord?" There gener-
ally will be four types of response: (1) Yes, I have; (2) No, I
have not; (3) I am not sure; or (4) What do you mean? We must
be prepared to follow up on each of these responses.
   We ought not to be discouraged if people do not respond
the first time we ask them to accept the Lord. When a non-
believer says no to a call to accept Christ, it is not no forever,
but just for that moment. The Holy Spirit is able to prepare the
heart for a positive response later. You have fulfilled an impor-
tant task. You have prompted the person to think about Christ's
claims on his or her life.
   At a lay congress in the Far East a man asked a missionary
whether he remembered him. He had attended the missionary's
meetings 10 years earlier. He had now been a church member
for three years. When the missionary asked, "What brought
you to a decision for Christ?" he responded, "It was the appeal
you made 10 years ago. I was never able to get the conviction
out of my mind that came to my heart when you made that
appeal. For seven years I lived with that conviction. Then I
made my decision."
   Even when appeals receive no immediate response, they
have a vital impact on the mind and heart of the listener.
   The decision Christ wants every believer to make is to
acknowledge Him publicly by inviting others to become His
disciples. What is God's promise if we acknowledge Him
before others? Luke 12:8.


46
Friday                                        February 4
FURTHER STUDY: Study the role of the Holy Spirit in pre-
paring hearts for the gospel message and in preparing those
who are to present it to them. Acts 10.
   Present Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit. "Present
the plain 'Thus saith the Lord' with authority, and exalt the
wisdom of God in the written Word. Bring the people to a
decision; keep the voice of the Bible ever before them. Tell
them you speak that which you do know, and testify that
which is truth, because God has spoken it. . . .
   "Talk to souls in peril, and get them to behold Jesus upon
the cross, dying to make it possible for Him to pardon. Talk to
the sinner with your own heart overflowing with the tender,
pitying love of Christ. Let there be deep earnestness, but not a
harsh, loud note should be heard in the voice of one who is
trying to win the soul to look and live. First have your own
soul consecrated to God. As you look upon our Intercessor in
heaven, let your heart be broken. Then, softened and subdued,
you can address repenting sinners as one who realizes the
power of redeeming love. Pray with these souls, by faith lay-
ing them at the foot of the cross; carry their minds up with
your mind, and fix the eye of faith where you look, upon Jesus,
the Sin Bearer. Get them to look away from their poor sinful
selves to the Saviour, and the victory is won."—Evangelism, p.
296-299.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Why is it important to lead a person to Christ before
     presenting the distinctive aspects of the Advent mes-
     sage?
   2. Suppose you appeal to people with whom you have
      been studying to accept Christ and they refuse. What
      would you do next?
SUMMARY: The most important decision for persons to make
is the decision to accept Jesus Christ as Saviour and Lord. By
coming to Him in surrender, they receive from Him the gift of
repentance. When they confess their sins, they are forgiven
and transformed in heart and begin living for Jesus. Our task is
to study the best time and method of inviting them to accept
Jesus.

Lesson 7                                     February 6-12

        How Do We Teach as
            Jesus Did?



Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: John 10:1-18; Matt. 13:24-
30, 36-43; 16:13-19; Luke 10:25-28; 24:27, 44.
     MEMORY TEXT: "And when Jesus finished these sayings,
     the crowds were astonished at his teaching, for he taught
     them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes"
     (Matt. 7:28, 29, RSV).
   KEY THOUGHT: Jesus applied the most effective teaching
techniques. We can be successful teachers of the Word if we
follow His methods.
   JESUS IS THE MASTER TEACHER. Jesus did not present a
mixture of possibilities and leave the people to separate truth
from error. He did not lecture on the law as did the scribes.
"Their custom was to dwell upon the obscurities of the law,
and the result of their reasoning was a jargon of absurdities,
which neither the learned could fathom nor the common people
understand."—Fundamentals of Christian Education, p. 236. Jesus
was not concerned to establish a scholarly reputation or to
have people admire His genius.
   Jesus spoke to people's hearts; He sought to address the
longings of their souls. With the complete assurance that His
teaching was truth essential for the salvation of His hearers,
Jesus spoke with divine authority.
   This week's lesson presents five simple teaching techniques
Jesus used—techniques that will give such life and saving vi-
tality to our teaching that nonbelievers will be led to the point
of decision.

Sunday                                          February 6
JESUS BEGAN WITH THE PEOPLE'S FAMILIAR
ASSOCIATIONS (John 10:1-18).
   Jesus led the minds of His listeners from the common ex-
periences and situations of daily life to acceptance of divine
truth. He knew the needs, interests, prejudices, and longings
of the people He was teaching. He led them from the mundane
to the spiritual, from the natural to the supernatural, from the
carnal to the morally pure, from the struggles of the present to
the security of eternity.
  How did Jesus illustrate His tender care for His people?
John 10:1-18.

   Jesus contrasted His role as the "good shepherd" (verse 11)
with the subversive attitudes and actions of those who attempt
to mislead the "sheep."
   "Jesus found access to the minds of His hearers by the
pathway of their familiar associations. . . . In a beautiful pasto-
ral picture He represents His relation to those that believe on
Him. No picture was more familiar to His hearers than this,
and Christ's words linked it forever with Himself. Never could
the disciples look on the shepherds tending their flocks with-
out recalling the Saviour's lesson. They would see Christ in
each faithful shepherd. They would see themselves in each
helpless and dependent flock."—The Desire of Ages, p. 476.
   In the following passages, observe Jesus' method of be-
ginning with the familiar interests, ideas, and attitudes of
His listeners:
   Matt. 4:18,19
   Matt 5:21, 22
   Matt. 5:27, 28
   Matt. 5:43, 44
   In giving Bible studies, we should begin with the interests
of the people with whom we are studying. Without their
being conscious of the method, it is possible to lead their
thoughts from that which is familiar to that which the Lord
wishes them to accept.

                                                                 49
Monday                                           February 7
JESUS ILLUSTRATED WITH REAL-LIFE SITUATIONS
(Matt. 13:24-30, 36-43).

   Why would Jesus' parable of the wheat and the tares be
especially captivating to His listeners? Matt. 13:24-30, 36-43.


   Jesus described a real-life situation. "In the East, men some-
times took revenge upon an enemy by strewing his newly
sown fields with the seeds of some noxious weed that, while
growing, closely resembled wheat."—Christ's Object Lessons, p.
71. What more effective way to illustrate the work of Satan in
bringing into the church those who have not been born again?
Jesus was speaking to a farming community.
   Notice that Jesus did not immediately explain the meaning
of the parable. But the minds of the people were stimulated to
think how such a familiar story could illustrate "the kingdom
of heaven" (verse 24). Later, when asked, Jesus applied the
parable.
   The teaching principles that emerge are: (1) illustrate truth
by life situations that are familiar to people, and (2) do not tell
all you know at one time; give the listeners time to think about
what you have already said. Questions will probably follow.

   Consider the appropriateness of the following parables
for truths Jesus wished to teach:

     Matt. 13:33

     Matt. 13:44

     Matt. 13:45, 46

     Matt. 13:47-50

   Real-life situations that grip people's attention today may
include stories about such matters as space travel, environ-
mental protection, disease control, the plight of the homeless,
love and acceptance in a racially tense society, and so on.

   The best illustrations for Bible studies often come from
life's experiences—as long as those experiences are meaning-
ful to the listeners.

JESUS ASKED QUESTIONS (Matt. 16:13-19).
   From a teaching point of view, why were Jesus' two ques-
tions, recorded in Matthew 16:13-15, especially helpful?

   What was Jesus aiming to teach His disciples in this
passage? Note verses 18, 19. The church would be built upon
Him, and He would give authority to His disciples. Why did
Jesus ask the general question first, "Who do people say that
the Son of man is?" (verse 13, NRSV), followed by the more
specific, "But who do you say that I am?" (verse 15, RSV)? The
contrast between popular opinion and the disciples' opinion
was dramatic. Obviously the church could not be built upon
John the Baptist, Elijah, Jeremiah, or any other prophet. Jesus
drew from the disciples their belief that He is the Messiah.
Then He emphasized that, because He is the Messiah, the
church would be built upon Him, and He would have the
right to share authority with His disciples. The two questions
set the stage for the message.
  Analyze the effectiveness of Jesus' questions recorded in:
  Matt. 17:24-27
   Matt. 22:18-22
   Matt. 22:41-46
   Luke 14:3
   Teaching is not the same process as preaching or lecturing.
Preaching is monologue; teaching involves dialogue. Ques-
tions are a vital part of teaching, because they are mind
openers. The right question encourages students to think
through a problem. Possibly the question will enable them to
discover truth for themselves. If not, at least grappling with
the question prepares them for the teaching to follow.
  In giving Bible studies it is essential to stimulate dialogue
by asking questions. Whether the answer given is right or
wrong, students can be gently directed to Bible teaching on
the subject of the question.

JESUS KEPT HIS MESSAGES SCRIPTURAL (Luke 10:25-28).
  In an interview with a lawyer, recorded in Luke 10, Jesus
used five effective teaching techniques:
Verse 26 Jesus' question encouraged the lawyer to answer his
   own question.
Verse 26 Jesus asked the lawyer for a Bible answer.
Verses 27, 28 Jesus commended the lawyer when he gave the
   right answer.
Verses 29-35 Jesus answered a question with a human-interest
   story.
Verse 36 Jesus gave the lawyer's question back to him, by asking it
   in relation to the story.
  Jesus' question directed the lawyer to the Scriptures. He
knew that this man did not believe in Him and would prob-
ably not accept His answer as authoritative. But the lawyer did
believe the Scriptures. Jesus appealed to Bible authority.
   Why did Jesus appeal to the Scriptures in the following
instances?
Mark 12:10
Luke 4:16-21
John 7:37-39
   "Jesus had nothing to do with the various subjects of dissen-
sion among the Jews. It was His work to present the truth. His
words shed a flood of light upon the teachings of patriarchs
and prophets, and the Scriptures came to men as a new revela-
tion. Never before had His hearers perceived such a depth of
meaning in the word of God. . . .
   "The rabbis spoke with doubt and hesitancy, as if the Scrip-
tures might be interpreted to mean one thing or exactly the
opposite. The hearers were daily involved in greater uncer-
tainty. But Jesus taught the Scriptures as of unquestionable
authority. Whatever His subject, it was presented with power,
as if His words could not be controverted."—The Desire of Ages,
p. 253.
  There is no substitute for Bible authority to establish truth.
The Bible must be applied to individual needs.

JESUS TAUGHT THAT SCRIPTURE FOCUSED ON HIM
(Luke 24:27, 44).
  What evidence do we have that the entire Bible, both Old
and New Testament, testifies of Jesus Christ?
John 5:39
Luke 24:27, 44
Rom 1:1-6
Rev. 1:1
   Jesus taught that the Old Testament Scriptures were de-
signed to focus on Him. The New Testament was written by
apostles or associates of apostles whose overwhelming desire
was to make Christ known.
   For there to be spiritual life and vitality in the Bible studies
we share with others, Christ must be the center.
  How can Christ be recognized as the center and focus of
the following Bible doctrines?
  1.The state of the dead: Jesus promises the gift of eternal life
     for those who believe (John 5:24). At His second advent,
     Jesus will raise from the dead those believers who fall
     asleep in death (John 11:11, 25, 26). This resurrection is
     possible because Jesus rose from the dead (1 Cor. 15:16-23).
  2. The Sabbath: The Sabbath is the day before the day Jesus
     rose from the dead (Luke 23:52-24:1). Jesus is the one
     who sanctifies us (makes us holy; 1 Cor. 1:30). The Sab-
     bath is a sign of this experience with Christ (Ex. 31:13).
     Jesus kept the Sabbath (Luke 4:16) and expected His
     followers to keep it after His death (Matt. 24:20).
  3. The investigative judgment: Jesus taught that there is a
     judgment of professed believers before His second com-
     ing (Matt. 22:11-14). In this judgment, Jesus is both Judge
     and Advocate (John 5:22; Dan. 7:9, 10, 13, 14). Those are
     vindicated who are wearing the robe of Christ's right-
     eousness (Rev. 3:5; 19:7, 8).
  Bible studies must be thoroughly Christ-centered. Because
the whole Bible focuses on Christ, any Bible presentation
should center in Him and point to Him.

                                                                 53

FURTHER STUDY: Analyze the teaching techniques Jesus used
in His interview with Nicodemus: John 3:1-21. Read "Teaching
in Parables" in Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 17-27.
   "Through the creation we are to become acquainted with
the Creator. The book of nature is a great lesson book, which
in connection with the Scriptures we are to use in teaching
others of His character, and guiding lost sheep back to the
fold of God. As the works of God are studied, the Holy Spirit
flashes conviction into the mind. It is not the conviction that
logical reasoning produces; but unless the mind has become
too dark to know God, the eye too dim to see Him, the ear too
dull to hear His voice, a deeper meaning is grasped, and the
sublime, spiritual truths of the written word are impressed on
the heart."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 24.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. In preparing a Bible study on tithing, how would you
     plan to apply the teaching techniques referred to in this
     lesson?
     2. Why is preaching inappropriate for a Sabbath School
        class? How can a Sabbath School teacher lead his or her
        class into deep Bible study and also have meaningful
        discussion?
     3. In giving a Bible study to a nonbeliever for the first
        time, where would you begin? Why?
     4. What kinds of illustration do you think are appropriate
        for a Bible study? Why?
SUMMARY: In His teaching, Jesus directed minds from their
habitual interests and understandings to contemplation of di-
vine truths. He used illustrations from nature and from life's
experiences. He involved His hearers in discussion by asking
questions. His teaching was scriptural and centered in His
own saving ministry. For our Bible teaching to be effective, it
must copy Jesus' method.

Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 5:15-17; 28:19, 20;
Col. 2:6; 1 Cor. 4:1, 2; Rev. 12:17.
   MEMORY TEXT: "You are my friends if you do what I
   command you" (John 15:14, RSV).
  KEY THOUGHT: God wants us to emulate Jesus and to do
whatever He commands.
   WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE CHRISTIAN LIFE? As we
discovered in Lesson 6, the first and most important decision
we should lead people to make is to surrender their hearts to
Christ, allowing Him to transform them by the inner work of
the Holy Spirit—the new-birth experience. The next step is for
us to fulfill the other aspects of Jesus' great commission: "teaching
them to observe all that I have commanded you" (Matt. 28:20,
RSV).
   The born-again Christian wants to know what Jesus teaches
and how He wants him to live. Because the whole Bible is a
testimony to Christ (Luke 24:27, 44), inspired by the Holy
Spirit (2 Tim. 3:16), we must lead interested people to under-
stand and accept Bible teaching. Using Jesus' teaching method,
outlined in Lesson 7, we can now simply and systematically
present each beautiful part of the Advent message. The order
in which we present the doctrines and prophecies of God's
Word will depend on the level of understanding and spiritual
growth of the person or persons with whom we are studying.
                                                                  55

MAINTAIN CONSTANT FELLOWSHIP WITH JESUS (Col.
2:6).
  How is the new-birth experience maintained? Col. 2:6;
Gal. 5:16-18, 25; 2 Cor. 4:16.

   The Christian life begins when we surrender our hearts to
Christ and invite Him to transform us by the Holy Spirit. Paul
reminded the Galatians that they had begun with the Spirit
(Gal. 3:3). His presence in the heart is Christ's presence, and
Christ's presence is righteousness in our hearts (Rom. 8:9, 10;
Eph. 3:17). Because righteousness is the qualification for eter-
nal life (Matt. 25:46; Heb. 12:14), we have the gift of eternal life
when we have Jesus living within by the Holy Spirit (John 3:36;
1 Cor. 1:30).
   We maintain this wonderful new life in Christ as every day
we renew our commitment to Him. As we began, so we are to
walk, by the power of the Holy Spirit. (See Rom. 15:16; 2 Thess.
2:13; 1 Peter 1:1, 2.)
   "To follow Jesus requires wholehearted conversion at the
start, and a repetition of this conversion every day."—Ellen G.
White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 1113.
   "None are living Christians unless they have a daily experi-
ence in the things of God and daily practice self-denial, cheer-
fully bearing the cross and following Christ. Every living Christian
will advance daily in the divine life. As he advances toward
perfection, he experiences a conversion to God every day; and
this conversion is not completed until he attains to perfection
of Christian character, a full preparation for the finishing touch
of immortality."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 505.
   So that the Holy Spirit can continue His sanctifying work
for us, what two daily activities are essential? (1) Matt. 26:41;
Eph. 6:18; (2) 2 Tim. 2:15; Rom. 15:4.

  No love relationship can be maintained without constant
communication. Our fellowship with Jesus depends on our
being willing to speak with Him and allowing Him to speak
with us. It is essential to have a time every day for prayer and
Bible study.
  From your own experience, explain what Jesus does for
you as you pray and study His Word every day.

KEEP ALL THE COMMANDMENTS (Matt. 5:17-20).
  What evidence do we have that Jesus wants His people to
keep all of the Ten Commandments?
Matt. 5:17-20 We are not even to think that Jesus came to
  abolish the law. He came to fill God's commandments
  with meaning by demonstrating how we are to keep them.
  The person who teaches that God has abolished any of His
  commandments will have no part in His kingdom. Christ
   replaced the ceremonial aspects of the law that pointed to
   the Messiah with the reality of His death, resurrection,
   and heavenly ministry in the sanctuary above. (See Heb.
  8:1-7.)
Matt. 24:20 Jesus did not change the Sabbath command to
  have it refer to the first day of the week instead of the
  seventh day. Jesus observed the seventh-day Sabbath (Luke
  4:16) and instructed His followers to continue observing it
  after His death (Matt. 24:20). Christians are to observe the
   fourth commandment, as they observe the other nine.
Luke 18:18-20 Jesus instructed the rich young ruler to keep the
   Ten Commandments, and He listed a few of them so that the
   ruler would know to which ones He was referring. This
   does not imply that Christians are not to obey the com-
   mandments Jesus did not mention. Jesus knew that the
   young ruler was not keeping these commandments, be-
   cause he lacked love for God and total commitment to Him.
   The young man was trying in his own strength, and failing.
John 14:15 (Compare John 15:10.) Jesus' commandments are
   the Father's commandments, because Jesus and theFather
   are One. (See John 10:30; 14:8-11.) Jesus said, "The words
   that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority; but
   the Father who dwells in me does his works" (verse 10,
   RSV). Jesus wants us to obey Him because we love Him.
   What do the following texts teach regarding the place of
the Ten Commandments in the life of the Christian? Rom.
3:31; 7:7; 8:3, 4 (compare James 2:10-12; 1 John 2:4; 5:1-4).

  According to the above Bible passages, where is the power
found to keep God's commandments? How is it obtained?

                                                             57

JOIN THE REMNANT CHURCH (Rev. 12:17).
  By what two characteristics does Jesus identify His rem-
nant, last-day church? Rev. 12:17.

   The two characteristics of the remnant church are clearly
stated: It is the church that (1) keeps the commandments of
God and (2) has the "testimony of Jesus."
   We have seen that Jesus wants His followers to keep all of
God's commandments. But what is the "testimony of Jesus"?
When John fell at the feet of the angel who was speaking to
him, the angel said, "See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant,
and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship
God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy" (Rev.
19:10). Who were these "brethren" who, like the angel, had
the spirit of prophecy? The parallel passage, Revelation 22:8,
9, answers the question. The "brethren" were the prophets.
Prophets have the spirit of prophecy. They receive direct
revelations from God to impart to His people.
   Will there be true prophets in the last-day church? Joel
2:28-32; Eph. 4:11-14; 1 Cor. 1:4-7.

   Seventh-day Adventists believe that the spirit of prophecy
was manifested in the life and work of Ellen G. White (1827-
1915): "One of the gifts of the Holy Spirit is prophecy. This gift
is an identifying mark of the remnant church and was mani-
fested in the ministry of Ellen G. White. As the Lord's
messenger, her writings are a continuing and authoritative
source of truth which provide for the church comfort, guid-
ance, instruction, and correction. They also make clear that
the Bible is the standard by which all teaching and experience
must be tested."—Seventh-day Adventist Yearbook, 1992, p. 7.
   Be able to explain why a new believer should belong to
the remnant church: (1) Christ adds members to His church
(Acts 2:47); (2) Christ loves His church supremely and is
preparing her for His second advent (Eph. 5:25-27); (3) we are
instructed to fellowship regularly with other church mem-
bers (Heb. 10:25); (4) Christ calls others to join His church
(Rev. 18:1-4) so that there "shall be one flock, one shepherd"
(John 10:16, RSV).

Wednesday                                     February 16
BE FAITHFUL STEWARDS (1 Cor. 4:1, 2).
   The Greek word translated "stewards" in 1 Corinthians 4:1,
2 (KJV, RSV) means "managers." Jesus wants us to depend
upon Him for power to manage our lives. He wants us to live
as He did so that others can receive His good news of
salvation. We are to utilize carefully our time in His service.
(See Ps. 90:12; Eph. 5:15, 16; Col. 4:5.) Christ will increase our
talents and our capacity to employ them if we use them for
Him. (See Matt. 25:14-30.)
 What does the Bible teach about stewardship of money?
Mal. 3:8-11; 1 Cor. 9:13, 14.

   God devised the tithing principle as a means of supporting
priests (ministers, pastors) who are called to full-time minis-
try for the people. Because pastors cannot depend on secular
livelihood while ministering, the people for whom they min-
ister are to support them. (See Num. 18:23, 24.) Note that we
bring the tithes to the "storehouse" (Mal. 3:10) as an act of
worship. We are not to give tithes to particular pastors, but to
the church, which distributes the tithes equitably. Giving a
tenth of our income to favorite pastors or projects denies the
biblical tithing principle. God directs His children to present a
tenth of their income for the support of the church's ministry.
   "The portion that God has reserved for Himself is not to be
diverted to any other purpose than that which He has speci-
fied. Let none feel at liberty to retain their tithe, to use
according to their own judgment. They are not to use it for
themselves in an emergency, nor to apply it as they see fit, even
in what they may regard as the Lord's work."—Testimonies,
vol. 9, p. 247.
   Why is stewardship of health important? 3 John 2; 1 Cor.
6:19, 20.

   Because our bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, we
should partake only of health-giving food and drink. Since
drugs—including tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine—are harmful
to health, we should not use them. The diet given in Eden
(Gen. 1:29) is acknowledged today as promoting health. This
involves a diet low in sugar, low in fat, and high in fiber. (See
Counsels on Diet and Foods, pp. 373-416.)

                                                                59

FULFILL JESUS' COMMISSION (Matt. 28:19, 20).

   Jesus invites each new believer to unite with other believers
in taking the gospel to the world. Not all have the same talents
or spiritual gifts, but all are offered the privilege of using their
abilities in service for Christ and humanity.

  In what ways can you cooperate with others in fulfilling
Christ's great commission recorded in Matthew 28:19, 20?


   Lesson 5 describes friendship evangelism. We all have
friends, neighbors, acquaintances, and relatives to whom we
can witness for Christ. We can offer encouragement and help
in times of need. We can give literature, give Bible studies,
cooperate with our local church in conducting evangelistic
meetings, Revelation seminars, and other kinds of seminar
designed to instruct people and relieve their suffering.
   Some can open their homes to friends willing to study the
Bible. Some can visit the sick, the imprisoned, or the lonely.
Some can take part in van ministries, designed to reach people
on the street and to provide assistance to the homeless.
   There are many personal ministries in which believers can
engage. The kind of ministry you choose will depend on your
talents and spiritual gifts, your interests and profession, and
the approach that will most likely influence your friends.

   What wonderful promise does Jesus give to those who
witness for Him? Matt. 10:32 (compare 1 John 2:23; Rom.
10:9).



   "Jesus is calling for many missionaries, for men and
women who will consecrate themselves to God, willing to
spend and be spent in His service. Oh, can we not remember
that here is a world to labor for? Shall we not move forward
step by step, letting God use us as His helping hand? Shall
we not place ourselves on the altar of service? Then the love
of Christ will touch and transform us, make us willing for
His sake to do and dare."—Colporteur Ministry, p. 18.

FURTHER STUDY: Study the special relevance of the mes-
sage to Sardis for those who are cooperating with Christ in
preparing themselves and others for the Second Advent: Rev-
elation 3:1-6.
   Read "Prepare to Meet the Lord," Testimonies, vol. 1, pp.
123-126.
   "A form of godliness will not save any. All must have a
deep and living experience. This alone will save them in the
time of trouble. Then their work will be tried of what sort it
is."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 125.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Why is it not too great a sacrifice to give up something
     or someone for Christ? Compare the things Christ has
     done for you with the things you have given up for
     Him.
  2. What are the practical advantages in keeping the Ten
     Commandments? How do these commands protect our
     health and happiness?
   3. How may you and your church congregation be more
      effective in leading persons to commit their lives to
      Christ and His will?
   4. How can you encourage members of your family to live
      the life of victory in Christ?
SUMMARY: Living as Jesus wants us to live begins with total
heart surrender to Him. Then obeying His commandments is a
pleasure. Realizing that salvation is Christ's free gift to those
who have faith, we do not keep His commandments in order to
save ourselves, but because we love to please Him, and be-
cause His law is for our happiness and well-being. It is a joy to
be part of Christ's remnant church because it provides us a
spiritual home and family. We respond to Jesus' call for faith-
ful stewards because our lives are much happier when Jesus
manages them. What a privilege is ours to work with Jesus for
others who need His love and our fellowship!

Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 3:13-17; 20:20-23;
John 1:12; 3:5; Rom. 6:3-5.
     MEMORY TEXT: "And now why do you wait? Rise and be
     baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on his name"
     (Acts 22:16, RSV).
   KEY THOUGHT: The baptism of the Spirit makes us Chris-
tians; water baptism proclaims us Christians; trials test us as
Christians.
   WHAT QUALIFIES US TO BE MEMBERS OF THE
CHURCH? Is membership merely a matter of being accepted
by a local congregation? Is being a member of the church the
same as being a member of a club? Does a person just decide to
belong to a particular group of religious people, and then
apply for membership as he or she would to any secular orga-
nization?
   People are qualified to be members of the church if they are
born-again Christians, committed to doing Jesus' will in every-
thing. People are baptized because they have had this experi-
ence and accepted this commitment. Water baptism does not
make a Christian; it publicly declares that a person is a Chris-
tian.
   Church membership follows baptism because committed
Christians who have declared their commitment publicly want
to have fellowship with others who have made the same com-
mitment. They want to be part of the family of God.

THE BAPTISM THAT MAKES US CHRISTIANS (John 1:12).

  When do we become children of God? John 1:12. What
does the Lord bestow upon us when we become His chil-
dren? Gal. 4:6.


   When we receive Christ, believing in Him, allowing Him to
live out His life through us, we become children of God. At the
point at which we believe, we are given the gift of the Holy
Spirit. "He who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap
eternal life" (Gal. 6:8, RSV). The Spirit in us is Christ in us, and
we experience "the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge"
because we are "filled with all the fulness of God" (Eph. 3:16-
19, RSV). So the Holy Spirit qualifies us for Christian life here
and now, and qualifies us to spend eternity with Jesus.

  To what are we introduced when we are baptized by the
Holy Spirit? 1 Cor. 12:12-18, 27.


   "For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—Jews
or Greeks, slaves or free—and all were made to drink of one
Spirit" (verse 13, RSV). The gift of the Spirit makes us members
of the "body" of Christ. That "body" is the church of Jesus
Christ, spoken of in 1 Corinthians 12.
   It is possible to be a member of a church but to lack the Holy
Spirit in your heart. Then you do not belong to the body of
Christ, even though your name is listed as a church member.
   Anyone who genuinely belongs to the body of Christ wishes
to have fellowship with other members of the body of Christ.
John Donne's statement, "No man is an island," is appropriate
when we discuss the Christian church. One of the most impor-
tant teachings of the New Testament is that those in whose
hearts the Holy Spirit is dwelling will fellowship together—
because they are parts of Christ's body that cannot live sepa-
rately from the other parts.

  The only initiation that makes us Christians is provided
by the Lord Jesus Christ. When we receive Him, He grants us
the baptism of His Holy Spirit, and we become members of
His spiritual body. Because Christ is now living out His life
through us (Gal. 2:20), we want to do whatever He asks of us.
Have you received the baptism that makes us Christians?

THE BAPTISM THAT PROCLAIMS US CHRISTIANS (Rom.
6:3-5).
   When believers are baptized, what truth are they pro-
claiming they believe? Rom. 6:3-5; 1 Cor. 15:1-4.

   Water baptism declares to the church and the world that the
candidates have received Christ as Saviour and Lord. As they
enter the waters of baptism, they are declaring, "I believe that
Jesus Christ died for my sins, rose again, and lives in heaven as
my Mediator." (See 1 Tim. 2:5; 1 John 2:1; Heb. 8:1, 2.)
   Water baptism declares that the candidate enjoys an ex-
perience. What experience? Gal. 2:20; 3:27 (compare 2 Cor.
5:17; Rom. 6:11, 18, 22).

   Each candidate for water baptism declares to the church
and the world: "I believe that Christ has given me His presence
by the Holy Spirit. Through Christ, I have died to sin, have
buried the old life, and have risen to new life in Christ."
   Baptizing people when the old sinful life is still ruling is
tantamount to burying them alive. Before baptism, the old
sinful life must die with Christ; then the born-again believer is
raised to "newness of life" (Rom. 6:4). Water baptism drama-
tizes the burial of the old life that has died and resurrection to
new life with Christ.
   What resolve does the baptismal candidate publicly ex-
press? Phil. 3:13, 14; Heb. 12:1, 2 (compare Luke 9:62; 2 Peter
2:20).

   The public resolve of the baptismal candidate is, "By Christ's
grace, I resolve to press on toward total victory over sin, allow-
ing Christ to complete in my heart that work He has so well
begun." (See 1 Peter 1:15, 16.)
   Baptism is not some kind of initiation rite. It is a public
avowal that the Holy Spirit has initiated the believer into
fellowship with Jesus Christ. When Jesus asks you to enter
into the experience of water baptism as a public testimony of
faith in Him, are you willing to respond positively? (See
Mark 16:16.)

WHO SHOULD BE BAPTIZED? (John 3:5).
  Does the Bible teach that infants should be baptized? Is
baptism for adults only?
 What did Jesus command in regard to baptism? John 3:5;
Matt. 28:18-20; Mark 16:16.

   Jesus commanded those who believe in Him to receive
water baptism. And He commanded believers, having taught
others the gospel, to baptize them (Matt. 28:19). Water bap-
tism is practiced by the church because Jesus asked us to
practice it. He said, "Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I
command you" (John 15:14). You are not one of Jesus' friends
if you refuse to follow His commands.
  In references to baptism in the book of Acts, who are
mentioned as the ones baptized?
Acts 2:41
Acts 8:12,13
Acts 8:36-38
Acts 9:17, 18
Acts 10:47, 48
   Infant baptism is not taught anywhere in Scripture. The
New Testament records that people are baptized in water be-
cause they have already been born of the Holy Spirit. But the
spiritual significance of the new-birth experience was gradu-
ally de-emphasized in the early church, and the performance
of rites and ceremonies as a means of attempting to earn God's
grace became more common. Thus it was incorrectly assumed
that baptism is the act by which candidates are born of the
Spirit. The next step was infant baptism. There is no evidence
of infant baptism in the Christian church before the last quar-
ter of the second century A.D. It was not a general practice
until the fifth century.
    In light of the biblical explanation of water baptism, why
is infant baptism ruled out?

WHAT IS THE BIBLE METHOD OF BAPTISM? (Matt. 3:13-17).
  Was baptism in Jesus' day and the apostolic era performed
by sprinkling, pouring, or by placing the candidate under
the water (immersion)? Study the following passages:
Matt. 3:13-17
John 3:23
Acts 8:36-39
   The two Greek verbs meaning "to baptize" used in the New
Testament (baptizo and bapto) both mean "to dip" or "to im-
merse." When Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist, He was
dipped under the water; it was baptism by immersion. John
baptized at Aenon because "there was much water there" (John
3:23). He would not have needed much water for sprinkling or
pouring. Philip and the Ethiopian both went down into the
water and came up out of the water (Acts 8:38, 39).
  To what is baptism likened in Scripture? Col. 2:12 (com-
pare Rom. 6:3-5).

   The only method of baptism that adequately illustrates its
meaning is baptism by immersion. Paul spoke of believers
"having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him
through your faith in the power of God, who raised him from
the dead" (Col. 2:12, NIV). Just as Jesus died, was buried, and
rose again, so believers have died to sin (Col. 3:3). Then they
are buried in the water of baptism and raised to new life in
Christ. Only baptism by immersion could adequately illustrate
that experience. The New Testament knows of no other method
by which believers were baptized. The earliest Christian churches
had baptismal tanks in which the candidates were immersed
in the water.
   You may ask the person with whom you are studying,
"Are you willing to be baptized in the same way Jesus was?"
Even though He was spiritually perfect, He was baptized "to
fulfil all righteousness" (Matt. 3:15). To set us an example,
Jesus was baptized by immersion. Now He asks you to fol-
low His steps by being baptized in the same manner. Are
you ready to do that?"

THE BAPTISM THAT TESTS US AS CHRISTIANS (Matt.
20:20-23).

   What baptism did Jesus predict for His disciples? Matt.
20:20-23.

   It is a mistake to imagine that once you have given your
heart to Christ life will be rosy and unruffled. Jesus never
promised that. For His disciples, Jesus predicted suffering and
death. Paul stated that "we must through much tribulation
enter into the kingdom of God" (Acts 14:22). Peter urged Christian
believers to rejoice at being permitted to suffer for Christ's
sake (1 Peter 4:12-14). The evil one is seeking to destroy our
faith. He will use any means he can devise to drive us away
from Christ. He will work through human beings, some of
whom may be friends and relatives, to deprecate our religious
faith and drive us back to our former lost state.
   The promises of the Lord to protect us from evil in the midst
of such trial and persecution are really wonderful. He says, "I
will be with you always, to the very end of the age" (Matt.
28:20, NIV). "I will never leave you nor forsake you" (Heb.
13:5, NKJV). The Bible teaches that nothing happens to us for
which God has not made provision. (See Rom. 8:28.) When we
are tempted to give in, we have the assurance, He "is able to
keep you from falling" (Jude 24). And when we fall, He is able
to restore us. (See Gal. 6:1.)
   What should be our attitude when our faith is tested?
1 Peter 4:12-16. What is awaiting the believer who by faith in
Christ endures the test? Rom. 8:18 (compare 2 Tim. 2:12; Matt.
10:32, 33).

   Christians who walk by faith in Jesus, allowing Him to
direct their lives and give them righteousness and peace, have
the thrilling assurance of present salvation in Christ (John 3:36)
and a place in the heavenly kingdom (Matt. 25:46). There is no
comparison between the sufferings of the present time and the
happiness and peace that Christ is preparing for those who
trust Him. Even in the midst of trial Jesus wants each of us to
have peace unlimited. (See John 16:24; 17:13.)
  Will you commit yourself to remaining true to Christ de-
spite the baptism of tribulation that will come to you?

                                                                67

FURTHER STUDY: Study other passages in Acts that refer to
baptism. What do they tell us about the candidates for bap-
tism? Acts 16:14, 15, 31-33; 18:8. When is rebaptism necessary?
Acts 19:1-7.
   Read "The Baptism," The Desire of Ages, pp. 109-113.

   "The glory that rested upon Christ is a pledge of the love of
God for us. It tells us of the power of prayer—how the human
voice may reach the ear of God, and our petitions find accep-
tance in the courts of heaven. By sin, earth was cut off from
heaven, and alienated from its communion; but Jesus has con-
nected it again with the sphere of glory. His love has encircled
man, and reached the highest heaven. The light which fell
from the open portals upon the head of our Saviour will fall
upon us as we pray for help to resist temptation. The voice
which spoke to Jesus says to every believing soul, 'This is my
beloved child, in whom I am well pleased.'"—The Desire of
Ages, p. 113.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How can you make the baptisms in your church more
     meaningful to the candidates and their loved ones?

     2. What can you and your church do to provide more fel-
        lowship for new church members who need to feel part
        of the church family?

     3. The Bible teaches the great importance of baptism. Why
        then did Paul thank God that he had baptized only a
        few? (See 1 Cor. 1:12-17; compare John 4:1-3).

     4. In the light of the lessons so far, what steps would you
        take to lead a person to the point of asking for baptism?

SUMMARY: The baptism that makes us Christians precedes
the baptism that proclaims us Christians. Water baptism does
not make Christians; it publicly declares that the candidates
have previously received Christ as Saviour and Lord. The Bible
teaches that believers in Christ should be baptized by immer-
sion. Through the baptism of tribulation that comes in one way
or another to all believers, Christ has promised His sustaining
presence. The kingdom of glory awaits the victor.

     What Is the Value of
        Fellowship?




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Acts 2:42-47; 2 Cor. 8:1-7;
Phil. 1:3-5; 2:1-5; 1 John 1:3, 6, 7.

  MEMORY TEXT: "But if we walk in the light, as he is in
  the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the
  blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin" (1 John
  1:7, RSV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Unless new church members receive spirit-
ual nurture, they may soon leave the church. A vital part of
this nurture involves fellowship with others who are enjoying
fellowship with Christ.

   WHY DON'T THEY STAY? Why do new members some-
times leave the church after a short time? Sometimes blame is
attributed to the evangelist or the person who gave the Bible
studies. Often the new member has never felt fully accepted
into the church family. There is a tendency for the established
members to form a club that the new member cannot break
in10. Established church members may give attention to their
circle of friends, forgetting that the new member feels like a
pauper in the palace.
   Another factor is that, because new members have only just
begun to grow, sometimes their lifestyles do not entirely con-
form to those practices accepted by established members. Be-
fore the new members have settled into an entirely new church
home, they are made to feel like prodigals, and the result is a
tragic loss of souls.

FELLOWSHIP WITH CHRIST (1 John 1:3, 6, 7).

  What is the relationship between fellowship with Christ
and fellowship with other believers? 1 John 1:3, 6, 7.


   A man in his thirties, a single parent, accepted Christ and
the Advent message, was baptized, and joined the church.
Each week he went to church with his small son, but the
church members gave them little attention. His emotional needs
and those of his little boy were sadly ignored. He came and
went each week hardly noticed. Instead of inviting him to their
homes and taking a genuine interest in his son, church mem-
bers generally ignored them. Soon he stopped attending church,
and before long he was no longer a participating member.
   "If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have
fellowship with one another" (1 John 1:7, RSV). If we are not
enjoying fellowship with one another, someone is not walking
in the light. Are church members who ignore the needs of
other church members walking in the light?
   Fellowship with Christ involves fellowship with others who
are filled with the Spirit. The Spirit in one heart responds to the
Spirit in another heart, and believers contribute to one another's
happiness and spiritual growth.

   What does Christ wish to share with us? Phil. 3:8-11; Heb.
10:32-36.


   The Greek word translated "fellowship" (Phil. 3:10 and
1 John 1:3, 6, 7) is koinonia, used 20 times in the New Testa-
ment. It has a number of related meanings: association, com-
munion, fellowship, close relationship, generosity, fellow-
feeling, gift, participation, sharing. The idea of sharing is in-
separable from the idea of fellowship. Jesus shares His righ-
teousness with us when we believe in Him (Phil. 3:9). He
wants us to "share his sufferings" (Phil. 3:10, RSV)—not be-
cause there is some morbid reason why we should suffer, but
because suffering and sacrifice are inevitable if others are to be
saved. This is why Paul commended the believers for entering
into the sufferings of others (Heb. 10:32, 33).

  In what ways does your fellowship with Christ result in
sharing with others?

FELLOWSHIP WITH BELIEVERS (Phil. 2:1-5).
  What does "fellowship of the Spirit" (Phil. 2:1) do for
Christian believers? Phil. 2:1-5.

   A missionary reports that in one part of his mission field
almost the entire membership of the church, involving hun-
dreds of people, was replaced over a seven-year period. The
former members did not all die or move away; many left the
church, and new members took their places. Why? One reason
was that the former members were not adequately nurtured. It
is one thing to bring large numbers into the church, but quite
another thing to provide them the spiritual sustenance to help
them grow spiritually.
   If we all apply the principles taught in Philippians 2:1-5,
each church member will contribute to the spiritual health of
fellow church members. There will be unity of love and belief.
Humility and generosity will reign supreme. No one will feel
exalted above his or her brothers and sisters.
   Paul's counsel in verse 4 is translated by the RSV: "Let each
of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the
interests of others." This happens when believers have the
mind of Christ (verse 5) by the presence of the Holy Spirit in
their hearts (verse 1).
  What is the place of sharing in the lives of Christian church
members? Heb. 13:16; 2 Cor. 1:3-7.

   Paul's counsel is not fulfilled only by giving generous offer-
ings. People have spiritual and emotional needs. They are
craving friendship, understanding, someone willing to listen
and offer a word of encouragement.
   Paul in prison thanked God for His comfort, "so that we
may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with
the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God"
(2 Cor. 1:4, RSV). Christ's blessings are not to be received and
stored up in our hearts to the exclusion of those in need
around us. Christ blesses us so that we can bless others.
   In what ways do you think you can be more directly in-
volved in providing fellowship for the brothers and sisters
of your local church?


                                                               71

SMALL GROUP FELLOWSHIP (Acts 2:42-47).
   How did Jesus demonstrate His respect for the effective-
ness of small-group fellowship? Matt. 9:10-13; 18:20; Luke
24:15, 32.

   Jesus trained His 12 disciples by living with them, teaching
them privately, and demonstrating for them how to teach
publicly. This was small-group fellowship of the first order.
God Himself was the teacher and the binding influence in the
group.
   There are a number of examples in the Gospels in which
Jesus visited the homes of the people and ate with them. He
was an occasional guest in the home of Mary, Martha, and
Lazarus of Bethany (Luke 10:38-42); He visited the home of
Zacchaeus (Luke 19:5); and He ate in the homes of publicans
and sinners (Matt. 9:10). Small-group fellowship was an
important part of Jesus' ministry. After His resurrection He
fellowshiped with His mourning disciples (Luke 24:15, 32;
John 20:19-23), offering encouragement, reassurance, and the
power of His Spirit.
   How effective were the small-group fellowships de-
veloped in the early Christian church? Acts 1:13, 14; 2:42-47;
12:12-16.

   The early Christians often met in homes. In fact, the first
churches were home churches. (See Rom. 16:5; 1 Cor. 16:19;
Col. 4:15.) Believers ate together, prayed together, shared
their sorrows and joys with one another, and shared their
material blessings with those who had need. In our next
lesson we will study how small-group fellowships can be an
effective means of spiritual nurture, as well as evangelistic
outreach.
   Prayer meetings and Bible studies are a great blessing
when the group is small. Informal sharing of convictions and
concerns provides members of the group with a much-needed
emotional outlet and spiritual uplift. Many church members
who will never speak in a larger group are more likely to open
their hearts in the relaxed atmosphere of a home fellowship.
 Would you like to be part of a small-group fellowship?
What steps can you take to make this possible?

FELLOWSHIP IN GIVING (2 Cor. 8:1-7).
  How did the apostle Paul describe the generosity of the
believers in Macedonia? 2 Cor. 8:1-7.

   The New International Version translates verse 4: "They
urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this
service to the saints." The Greek speaks of "the fellowship of
the service which was for the saints." The word koinonia may
be translated "fellowship," "contribution," "sharing." Though
poor, the Macedonian believers entreated earnestly "for the
favor of taking part in the relief of the saints" (verse 4, RSV) in
Jerusalem. Here is a classic example of the fellowship of
giving. Believers in one part of the world regarded it as a great
privilege to give to distant fellow believers who were perfect
strangers. Why? Because "the grace of God" (verse 1) con-
strained them to contribute.
  What motivated the Macedonians to give so generously?
Rom. 15:26, 27; Phil. 4:14, 15. What counsel should lead us to
imitate their generosity? Rom. 12:13; Gal. 6:6.

   Fellowship, or partnership in giving, is much needed in the
church today. It is reported that there are thousands of
Adventist believers in some parts of the world who cannot
afford a Sabbath School quarterly, and the church administra-
tion does not have the money to provide them. Hymnbooks
and Bibles are in short supply in some areas. In several
countries our church members are struggling financially.
Their efforts to provide schools for their children are ham-
pered by insufficient funds. The fellowship of giving by
church members in both home fields and mission fields will
do much to alleviate the burdens.
   The church is facing unprecedented opportunities to preach
the gospel around the world. People are hungry for the
message. What a tragedy if we should lose the opportunity to
meet the need because of insufficient funds! We pray that the
Lord will be able to inspire those with means to facilitate the
work in these countries.
  To what extent are you involved in the fellowship of giv-
ing? What more can you do to assist the church in taking the
gospel to all the world?

                                                                 73

FELLOWSHIP IN MINISTRY (Phil. 1:3-5).

   Why was the apostle Paul especially grateful for the work
of Philippian church members? Phil. 1:3-5; 4:3.


    Church members worked with Paul in the great task of
making Christ known. Fellowship in ministry involves coop-
eration with our church pastors. Alone, they can never finish
the work. They need the help of church members in (1)
visiting the sick; (2) working for the youth; (3) giving Bible
studies; (4) opening their homes for group Bible studies; (5)
meeting some of the communities' needs.
    For example, one church in California conducts a day-care
center, a bakery, and a medical clinic. The church members
work closely with the pastors to provide services for the
inner-city community. Only because of fellowship in ministry
is it possible to conduct such outreach ministry. The result is
rapid growth in membership. Such unselfish service has
attracted people to the church who otherwise would not have
been interested and would not have attended evangelistic
meetings.

  How may every believer be involved in the fellowship of
ministry? Gal. 6:2, 10.


   "Every soul is to minister. He is to use every physical,
moral and mental power, through sanctification of the Spirit,
that he may be a laborer together with God. All are bound to
devote themselves actively and unreservedly to God's service.
They are to cooperate with Jesus Christ in the great work of
helping others. Christ died for every man. He has ransomed
every man by giving His life on the cross. This He did that man
might no longer live an aimless, selfish life, but that he might
live unto Jesus Christ, who died for his salvation. All are not
called upon to enter the ministry, but nevertheless, they are to
minister. It is an insult to the Holy Spirit of God for any man to
choose a life of self-serving. Ministry means not only the study
of books and preaching. It means service."—Ellen G. White
Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 1159.

  Bearing others' burdens is a delicate way to win their love
and loyalty to Christ. Can you describe how you have found
joy in this kind of ministry?

FURTHER STUDY: Consider the sacrifice Jesus made to enter
into fellowship with us: Heb. 2:14-18. Note the blessed privi-
lege that is ours: 1 Peter 4:12-14.
   Read "A Message of Warning and Entreaty," The Acts of the
Apostles, pp. 298, 299.
   "You are not to come together simply as a matter of form,
but for the interchange of thought, for the relation of your
daily experiences, for the expression of thanksgiving, for the
utterance of your sincere desire for divine enlightenment, that
you may know God, and Jesus Christ, whom He has sent.
Communing together in regard to Christ will strengthen the
soul for life's trials and conflicts. Never think that you can be
Christians and yet withdraw yourselves within yourselves.
Each one is a part of the great web of humanity, and the
experience of each will be largely determined by the experi-
ence of his associates."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 362.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. A young woman visits your church for the first time
     wearing heavy makeup, large earrings, and slacks.
     What should be your attitude to her?
   2. A newly baptized brother is sick in the hospital. When
      you visit him, you find him smoking. How should you
      relate to him?
   3. You are invited to have lunch at the home of a new
      member of your church. The meal includes meat, which
      you feel you cannot eat. How do you decline without
      creating embarrassment and hurting the feelings of the
      hostess?
SUMMARY: If new members of the church are to remain, they
must be absorbed into the fellowship of the church family.
They must be given the opportunity to grow as they fellow-
ship with Christ and with other believers.

READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Acts 20:20; 1 Corinthians
12; Rev. 18:1-4.
     MEMORY TEXT: "Now you are the body of Christ and
     individually members of it" (1 Corinthians 12:27, RSV).
   KEY THOUGHT: The final great outpouring of the Holy
Spirit will occur when believers are allowing the Spirit to em-
ploy their spiritual gifts for the salvation of souls.
   "THE GREAT OUTPOURING OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD,
which lightens the whole earth with His glory [Rev. 18:1], will
not come until we have an enlightened people, that know by
experience what it means to be laborers together with God.
When we have entire, wholehearted consecration to the serv-
ice of Christ, God will recognize the fact by an outpouring of
His Spirit without measure; but this will not be while the
largest portion of the church are not laborers together with
God."—Christian Service, p. 253.
   "If all were willing, all would be filled with the Spirit [Eph.
5:18-20]. Wherever the need of the Holy Spirit is a matter little
thought of, there is seen spiritual drought, spiritual darkness,
spiritual declension and death. Whenever minor matters oc-
cupy the attention, the divine power which is necessary for the
growth and prosperity of the church, and which would bring
all other blessings in its train, is lacking, though offered in
infinite plenitude."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 50.

SPIRITUAL GIFTS FOR ALL (1 Cor. 12:1-26).
   What are spiritual gifts? Why are they given? List the
spiritual gifts mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12:4-11.

   As mentioned in this passage and related passages, spir-
itual gifts are special endowments the Holy Spirit bestows
upon believers. (Compare Rom. 12:3-11; Eph. 4:7-16; 1 Peter
4:9-11.) Spiritual gifts are not the same as the talents with
which one was born or that have been developed over time.
Yet spiritual gifts enhance natural talents so that the believer
can do a specific work for Christ. The Lord uses people of
varied talents and temperaments and bestows upon them
spiritual endowments to be used for the spiritual upbuilding
of His "body"—the Christian church.
   Some are given special wisdom, others knowledge, or faith.
Obviously every believing Christian has a measure of wis-
dom, knowledge, and faith. But Paul is speaking of additional
endowments, involving specialized abilities, enabling God's
people to make distinctive contributions to the upbuilding of
His kingdom. (Compare Rom. 12:3-8.)
   Why should all members of the church feel needed and
valuable whatever their spiritual gift(s) may be? 1 Cor. 12:12-
26.

   Not only are all believers different in personality and
talents but also they have different spiritual gifts. The result is
a church that, like a human body, is made up of many vitally
important functional parts. If one part does not fulfill its God-
given function, the whole body suffers. The doctrine of
spiritual gifts is designed to teach that the church's spiritual
life and outreach to the world are dependent on all members
using the gifts the Holy Spirit has given them.
  What is your spiritual gift? The Holy Spirit is the only one
qualified to tell you. Human opinions are often helpful, but
not definitive. The Lord will reveal your gift(s) as you pray
and devote yourself to His service. The Spirit qualifies those
willing to work for souls. Your special qualifications will
become apparent as you involve yourself in some kind of
ministry for others.


                                                                 77

THE ROLE OF THE CLERGY (1 Cor. 12:27-31).

   Which of the spiritual gifts listed by Paul qualify people
for pastoral leadership in the church? 1 Cor. 12:27-31; Rom.
12:3-8.


   Paul does not separate spiritual gifts for clergy from spirit-
ual gifts for laity. As we observed in a previous lesson, the
clergy are part of the people of God, not separate from them
or superior to them. But some of the spiritual gifts are
designed for specialized ministries of the kind conducted by
spiritual leaders of the church: apostles, prophets, evangelists,
pastors, teachers, healers, and administrators.

   What is the purpose of the gifts bestowed upon these
spiritual leaders? Eph. 4:11-16.


   The purpose is not that clergy are to do all the work while
the laity relax in spiritual apathy. The Spirit's gifts are "to
equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the
body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and
of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to
the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ" (Eph. 4:12,
13, RSV). Those with specialized gifts are to train church
members to conduct the work of ministry. The gifts of the
clergy are to be employed in training others to use their
spiritual gifts.
   Ministry is the work of the entire church—not just the
clergy. The result of ministry is to be spiritual growth for the
church, Christlikeness for each church member.
   But the result is even more far-reaching. When church
members employ their spiritual gifts in ministry, the clergy
will have more time to fulfill their calling—the equipping of
the saints and the evangelizing of unentered territories. "In-
stead of keeping the ministers at work for the churches that
already know the truth, let the members of the churches say to
these laborers: 'Go work for souls that are perishing in
darkness. We ourselves will carry forward the services of the
church.'"—Evangelism, p. 382.

   Do you feel that you are equipped for ministry? What
kind of ministry makes the best use of your distinctive spirit-
ual gift(s)?

SMALL-GROUP EVANGELISM (Acts 20:20).

  What do the following passages have to say about small
groups of worshiping Christians?
Acts 16:40
Acts 20:20
1 Cor. 16:19
Col. 4:15
   "The formation of small companies as a basis of Christian
effort is a plan that has been presented before me by One who
cannot err. If there is a large number in the church, let the
members be formed into small companies, to work not only for
the church members but for unbelievers also."—Evangelism, p.
115.
   "On such occasions as our annual camp meetings we must
never lose sight of the opportunities afforded for teaching the
believers how to do practical missionary work in the place
where they may live. In many instances it would be well to set
apart certain men to carry the burden of different lines of
educational work at these meetings."—Testimonies, vol. 9, pp.
82, 83.
   "Let the teachers in our schools devote Sunday to mission-
ary effort. Let them take the students with them to hold meet-
ings for those who know not the truth. Sunday can be used for
carrying forward various lines of work that will accomplish
much for the Lord. On this day house-to-house work can be
done. Open-air meetings and cottage meetings can be held."
 —Counsels to Parents and Teachers, p. 551.
    Small-Group Outreach (Hagerstown, Md.: Review and Herald,
1991). Kurt Johnson describes an effective program of small-
group evangelism. The author explains how to begin small
groups in a local church, how to conduct them, and how to use
 them for soul-winning. Groups proving effective are: (1) shar-
ing/prayer group; (2) Bible-study group; (3) nurture (covenant)
 group; (4) support group; (5) outreach (mission) group, and (6)
 house group. The book describes the functions of these groups.
   Johnson's book concludes: "Why not bow your head in
prayer right now and ask God to reveal how you can be a part
of His vision for His remnant people?"—Page 90.

SABBATH SCHOOL NURTURE AND EVANGELISM (Rom.
15:1-6).
  What primary goals for our Sabbath Schools are suggested
by the following Bible passages?
Acts 16:13-15
Rom. 15:1-6
Heb. 3:13
Heb. 4:11,12
Heb. 10:23-25
   "It was in 1852, eight years after the first group of
Sabbathkeeping Adventists was formed (in Washington, New
Hampshire) that SDA Sabbath school work began. . . . At that
time the leaders were focusing their attention on establishing
the church members in the faith."—Seventh-day Adventist Ency-
clopedia, Commentary Reference Series, vol. 10, p. 1122.
   Since then, Sabbath Schools have been established through-
out the world with the specific intent of applying the Bible
counsel for believers to meet regularly for mutual spiritual
edification. Note the major goals of Sabbath School indicated
by inspired counsel (see Counsels on Sabbath School Work):
1.Small-group Bible study as a means of spiritual nurture.
2. Equiping believers with the necessary Bible knowledge and
   inspiration for sharing their faith with others.
3. Providing instruction for visitors not of our faith.
4. Inspiring Sabbath School members to pray and contribute
   means for the church's worldwide mission program.
5. Mutual encouragement of believers who, concerned for one
   another and for those not of our faith, constitute a spiritual
   support group. Believers can relate to the joys and trials of
   others in their group.
   Various methods of organizing and conducting Sabbath School
are being applied around the world. One method that has
proved effective in some areas as an evangelistic outreach
program is that described by Calvin Smith in his book, Church
Growth Through Sabbath School Action Units (General Confer-
ence of Seventh-day Adventists, 12501 Old Columbia Pike,
Silver Spring, MD 20904, 1991).

THE SECOND PENTECOST (Rev. 18:1-4).
   What conditions do these passages give for the reception
of the Holy Spirit (the former and latter rains)?
1.Acts 1:14; Zech. 10:1
   "The circumstances may seem to be favorable for a rich
outpouring of the showers of grace. But God Himself must
command the rain to fall. Therefore we should not be remiss in
supplication. We are not to trust to the ordinary working of
providence. We must pray that God will unseal the fountain of
the water of life."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 509.
2.Acts 2:38, 39; 3:19
    "Today you are to have your vessel purified, that it may be
ready for the heavenly dew, ready for the showers of the latter
rain; for the latter rain will come, and the blessing of God will
fill every soul that is purified from every defilement."—Evan-
gelism, p. 702.
3.Acts 4:32
   "Notice that it was after the disciples had come into perfect
unity, when they were no longer striving for the highest place,
that the Spirit was poured out. They were of one accord. All
differences had been put away."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 20.
4.Acts 1:8; 22:15
   "The disciples felt their spiritual need and cried to the Lord
for the holy unction that was to fit them for the work of soul-
saving. . . . They were weighted with the burden of the salva-
tion of souls."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 37.
   How will God's work in the earth be finished? Rev. 18:1-4.

    "The angel who unites in the proclamation of the third
angel's message is to lighten the whole earth with his glory.
... The work will be similar to that of the Day of Pentecost.
As the 'former rain' was given, in the outpouring of the
Holy Spirit at the opening of the gospel, to cause the
upspringing of the precious seed, so the 'latter rain' will be
given at its close for the ripening of the harvest."—The Great
Controversy, p. 611.



                                                               81

 FURTHER STUDY: On the promised outpouring of the Holy
Spirit, study the following passages: Joel 2:23, 28-32; Hosea 6:3;
10:12; John 14:16-23, 26; 16:7-15; Luke 24:49.
   Read "Pray for the Latter Rain" in Testimonies to Ministers,
pp. 506-512.
   "As the dew and the rain are given first to cause the seed to
germinate, and then to ripen the harvest, so the Holy Spirit is
given to carry forward, from one stage to another, the process
of spiritual growth. The ripening of the grain represents the
completion of the work of God's grace in the soul. By the
power of the Holy Spirit the moral image of God is to be
perfected in the character. We are to be wholly transformed
into the likeness of Christ.
   "The latter rain, ripening earth's harvest, represents the spirit-
ual grace that prepares the church for the coming of the Son of
man. But unless the former rain has fallen, there will be no life;
the green blade will not spring up."—Testimonies to Ministers,
p. 506.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Can your Sabbath School class become an effective soul-
     winning unit? If so, what steps should you take to de-
     velop such a program?

     2. What other kinds of small group could be developed in
        your church? Would you be willing to open your home
        for one of these groups?

     3. What does your spiritual gift have to do with the kind of
        outreach group to which you should belong?

     4. Do you have neighbors who might enjoy participating
        in a small group in your home? How would you go
        about starting such a group?

     5. How does the ultimate gift of the latter rain coincide
        with the use of spiritual gifts? Will we receive the latter
        rain if we fail to use our gifts now?

SUMMARY: Every member of the church has at least one
spiritual gift—the Holy Spirit's special endowment for service.
When every member of the church is willing to use his or her
gift for Christ, there will be great spiritual revival. One effec-
tive way in which spiritual gifts may be used is in small groups
designed for Bible study, witnessing, sharing, and fellowship.

   How Did Christians
Witness Through the Ages?




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Rev. 2:1-3:22.

  MEMORY TEXT: "Remember then from what you have
  fallen, repent and do the works you did at first. If not, I
  will come to you and remove your lampstand from its
  place, unless you repent" (Rev. 2:5, RSV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Immediately after Jesus' death and resur-
rection, the church presented a faithful witness to the world
that is to be emulated by believers today.

   SPIRITUAL DECLINE FOLLOWED BY SPIRITUAL RE-
VIVAL AND REFORMATION. In the apostolic era, Christian
believers, filled with the Holy Spirit, were consumed by the
desire to reflect Christ's character to the world. His sacrifice,
His righteousness and salvation, and His promised return were
the subjects that absorbed their attention and formed the heart
of their proclamation.
   As time went by and Christ did not come, Christians rein-
terpreted the gospel in accordance with their own philosophi-
cal interests. The New Testament message was blurred, and
apostasy was the result. The sixteenth-century Reformation
began a process that has been hampered by the unwillingness
of popular churches to accept fully the apostolic ideal. The
Advent movement is a revival of that ideal, designed to present
the true gospel worldwide. Spiritual decline in the Christian
church generally will be met by spiritual revival in the rem-
nant church.

                                                              83

WITNESS IN THE APOSTOLIC ERA (Rev. 2:1-7).
  What attitude to witnessing did the earliest Christians
adopt?
Rev. 2:2, 3

Phil. 1:3-7
Col. 1:3-8

   In His message to John on Patmos, Jesus cited the faithful-
ness of the Ephesian church (Eph. 1:15) as an example of the
faithfulness of the church in the apostolic era. The earliest
Christians understood the gospel as the story of Christ's death
and resurrection (1 Cor. 15:1-4), and the spiritual transforma-
tion available to believers (Gal. 2:16; 3:1-3; Col. 1:27; Eph. 3:14-
21.) This message was proclaimed in public and in private
with such earnestness that "to every nation under heaven the
gospel was carried in a single generation."—The Ministry of
Healing, p. 141.
   "In every city the work was carried forward. Souls were
converted, who in their turn felt that they must tell of the
inestimable treasure they had received. They could not rest till
the light which had illumined their minds was shining upon
others."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 579, 580.

   What difficulties arose in the first-century Christian church
that tended to blunt the effectiveness of the church's witness
for Christ? Rev. 2:2, 4-6.


    The church was troubled by false apostles—would-be
leaders claiming that God had given them special messages for
the church. They were, in fact, motivated by the desire for
personal notoriety (verse 2). Moreover, the church was af-
flicted by the influence of unfaithful members called "Nicolaitans"
(verse 6). The same class was later identified with the apostasy
of Balaam (verses 14, 15). As was Balaam, so these people were
guilty of covetousness, hypocrisy, idolatry, and immorality.
(See Numbers 22-24.) The first love of the believers tended to
wane.

   What influences within the church today tend to spoil the
effectiveness of the church's witness?

WITNESS IN THE POST-APOSTOLIC ERA (Rev. 2:8-17).
   What was one of the ways Christians witnessed for Christ
in the immediate post-apostolic period? Rev. 2:8-11.

   In most instances, second- and third-century Christians were
poor in this world's goods. They were obliged to witness for
Christ at a time when Christianity was regarded as an illegal
religion. They suffered periodic persecution from the imperial
Roman power, as well as from local opponents.
   The period of church history represented by the church of
Smyrna is the immediate post-apostolic period from the end of
the first century to the end of the Diocletian persecution.
Diocletian's persecuting edicts were enforced for ten years,
A. D. 303-313. (See Rev. 2:10, RSV, "For ten days [years] you
will have tribulation.")
   "The sufferings which they endured brought Christians nearer
to one another and to their Redeemer. Their living example
and dying testimony were a constant witness for the truth; and
where least expected, the subjects of Satan were leaving his
service and enlisting under the banner of Christ."—The Great
Controversy, p. 42.
  What were the circumstances under which Christians were
obliged to witness for Christ during the fourth and fifth
centuries? Rev. 2:12-17.

   The period of church history represented by the church of
Pergamum began with Constantine's Edict of Milan (A.D. 313)
that gave Christianity full legal equality with any other reli-
gion in the Roman world. Because Constantine professed con-
version to Christianity, it became popular to become a Chris-
tian. In the period that followed (A.D. 313-538) the medieval
papacy rose to power. In this period the church accepted
numerous perversions of Bible teaching. It is difficult for
believers to witness in times of persecution, but even more
difficult in times of popularity and prosperity. (See The Great
Controversy, pp. 49, 50.)
  How do popularity and materialism affect the church to-
day? Can you suggest ways for the church to counteract the
negative results of prosperity?

WITNESS IN THE MIDDLE AGES (Rev. 2:18-29).

   What encouragement did the Lord give His true followers
during the darkest period of church history—the Middle
Ages? Rev. 2:18, 19, 24-28. What severe warning did He give
to those who rejected Bible truth? Verses 20-23.


   The church of Thyatira represented the Christian church
during the period A.D. 538 to 1517. In this period church and
state were combined. Europe became known as the "Christian
Republic." Although maintaining national sovereignty, Euro-
pean countries were loyal to the official state church. The
church dictated to secular authorities regarding religious
matters, and secular authorities enforced the decrees of the
church.
   Although the Bible was studied during this period, large
numbers of people were denied access to it. Citizens were
forced to accept official interpretations of Scripture and reli-
gious tradition. Because the church's priests usurped the place
of Christ as Mediator between God and humankind, the sepa-
ration of clergy from laity was accepted as standard church
practice. The clergy were regarded as spiritually superior. Their
dictates were accepted by church members, and their celebra-
tion of the sacraments was regarded as essential to salvation.
   Many refused to accept the demands of the established church
and, cherishing the Bible, witnessed for Christ, despite the dire
consequences. The Waldenses were one such group. In various
European countries they witnessed, sometimes secretly, some-
times publicly. Although fiercely persecuted, they preserved
their commitment to Christ and His Word and demonstrated
for all time that physical suffering need not crush spiritual life.
(See "The Waldenses," in The Great Controversy, pp. 61-78.)
   John Wycliffe (c. 1330-1384), "the morning star of the Refor-
mation," stood bravely for the truth in England and trained a
group of witnesses called Lollards. They distributed copies of
the Bible that Wycliffe and others had translated into English
and influenced a large proportion of the population for Bible
truth.
   Likewise, John Huss (c. 1372-1415) and his followers, influ-
enced by Wycliffe's teachings, preached salvation through Christ
in fourteenth-century Bohemia. Huss was burned at the stake
in 1415, but his testimony, and that of his followers, could not
be destroyed.

WITNESS IN THE REFORMATION ERA (Rev. 3:1-6).
  What marred the Christian witness of believers in the
period of church history represented by the church of Sardis?
Rev. 3:1-3.

   The church of Sardis represents the transitional period of
Christian church history, from the beginning of the sixteenth-
century Reformation (1517) to the beginning of the modern era
(1798). Because of the Reformation's influence, the power of
the medieval state church was broken in many countries of
Europe. But it remained intact in some countries until the late
eighteenth century.
   The great European sixteenth-century Reformers—Luther,
Calvin, and Zwingli—and leading English Reformers—Cranmer,
Latimer, and Ridley—taught salvation by faith in Jesus Christ.
They rejected the medieval idea that human works contribute
to the level of one's salvation standing with God. Christ's
grace alone was recognized as the means of salvation. (See
Eph. 2:8-10.)
   Unfortunately, the Reformers and their followers were not
united doctrinally or spiritually. Because the Protestant church
splintered badly, the effectiveness of Christian witness was seri-
ously undermined. The Lord addressed believers in the Reforma-
tion and post-Reformation period: "I know your works; you have
the name of being alive, and you are dead" (Rev. 3:1, RSV). A
spiritually dead church cannot win souls. It can argue endlessly
about theology, but its outreach to the world is largely futile.
  What does Christ offer as the solution for spiritual and
evangelistic inertia? Rev. 3:4-6.

   Only the righteousness of Christ, received by faith, is the
answer to a spiritually ailing church. When we accept Christ's
perfect righteousness as counted for us (Rom. 4:22-25), when
we accept His perfect righteousness as bestowed upon us by
the Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:9, 10), we have the power and motiva-
tion for effective Christian witness.
   "The message of Christ's righteousness is to sound from
one end of the earth to the other to prepare the way of the
Lord. This is the glory of God, which closes the work of the
third angel."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 19.

                                                                87

WITNESS IN THE MODERN ERA (Rev. 3:7-22).
   What special encouragement did the Lord give to the early
Adventists at the beginning of the modern period of church
history? Rev. 3:7-13.

   After the French Revolution in the late eighteenth century,
the doctrine of the separation of church and state was accepted
in some countries of Western Europe. The newly independent
United States of America accepted the same principle. Now
the message of salvation by faith in Christ, combined with the
announcement of His second coming, was preached with re-
newed fervor. The first half of the nineteenth century wit-
nessed worldwide missionary endeavor and evangelistic out-
reach unseen since apostolic times.
   This was the era of Joseph Wolff and William Miller. (See "A
Great Religious Awakening," in The Great Controversy, pp. 355-
374.) Because the early Adventists believed in the soon appear-
ing of Jesus, they gave the message with power.
   After the disappointment of 1844, what spiritual condition
gradually crept into the developing remnant church? What is
the solution to the problem? Rev. 3:14-22.

   Spiritual lukewarmness is damaging to evangelistic out-
reach. In some parts of the world, the church has become
comfortable and apathetic. The medieval idea of clergy as the
superior spiritual class contributes to the relative inactivity of
the laity. The work of soul-winning is left largely to pastors
and evangelists, while many church members look on as
uninvolved spectators.
   "A revival and a reformation must take place, under the
ministration of the Holy Spirit. Revival and reformation are
two different things. Revival signifies a renewal of spiritual
life, a quickening of the power of mind and heart, a resurrec-
tion from spiritual death. Reformation signifies a reorganiza-
tion, a change in ideas and theories, habits and practices. Ref-

FURTHER STUDY: Study the following passages as they re-
late to the counsel to the Laodiceans (Rev. 3:18):
   "Gold tried in the fire": 1 Peter 1:7-9, 18, 19; Gal. 5:6.
   "White raiment": Rev. 3:4; 19:7, 8; Gal. 3:26, 27; Phil. 3:7-11.
   "Eyesalve": Eph. 1:17, 18; 3:16-19; 1 John 2:27; 4:13.
   Read "The Final Warning," in The Great Controversy, pp.
603-612.

   "Servants of God, with their faces lighted up and shining
with holy consecration, will hasten from place to place to pro-
claim the message from heaven. By thousands of voices, all
over the earth, the warning will be given. Miracles will be
wrought, the sick will be healed, and signs and wonders will
follow the believers. . . .
   "The message will be carried not so much by argument as
by the deep conviction of the Spirit of God. . . . Now the rays of
light penetrate everywhere, the truth is seen in its clearness,
and the honest children of God sever the bands which have
held them."—The Great Controversy, p. 612.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. List the reasons for the successful evangelistic outreach
     to the world of the earliest Christians. How can we
     apply first-century methods to our era?

   2. Why is there a dynamic relationship between under-
      standing the gospel and successful outreach to the world?
      How would you describe the relationship between mes-
      sage and mission? Illustrate from church history.

   3. On the basis of Bible prophecy, what repetition of the
      medieval situation do you anticipate in the modern era?
      How should witnesses for Christ relate to this repeti-
      tion of history?

SUMMARY: In the history of the Christian church successful
soul-winning has been in direct relationship to the spiritual
condition of professed Christians. Disbelief and doctrinal
apostasy have been associated with failure to witness in
Christ's way. When, in the modern church, purity of faith
combines with evangelistic zeal, then church members will
unite to fulfill Jesus' great commission.

      What Is Christ's Last
      Message to the World?


       4ishigst..

Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Revelation 14.
     MEMORY TEXT: "And I saw another angel fly in the
     midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach
     unto them that dwell on the earth, to every nation, and
     kindred, and tongue, and people" (Rev. 14:6).
   KEY THOUGHT: The mission of Christ's remnant church is
the proclamation of the gospel worldwide. Special end-time
features of the gospel are contained in the three angels' mes-
sages of Revelation 14:6-12.
   CHRIST'S LAST MESSAGE TO THE WORLD is con-
tained in Revelation 14. The chapter divides naturally into
three main sections. The first section (verses 1-5) depicts those
who received God's end-time seal, standing before God's throne
in heaven. The second section (verses 6-13) goes back to the
situation before the second coming of Jesus. This section pre-
sents the three messages to which believers respond before
they are sealed. The third section (verses 14-20) depicts the
second coming of Jesus, when those who were sealed are
translated to heaven and those who received the mark of the
beast are destroyed.
   Those who accept the three angels' messages and live very
near to Jesus by prayer and Bible study will be among those
taken to heaven with Jesus when He returns. The purpose of
our witness to the world is to cooperate with Christ in prepar-
ing a people spiritually to meet Him at His advent.

THE REWARD OF THOSE WHO RECEIVE THE END-TIME
SEAL OF GOD (Rev. 14:1-5).
   Where are the sealed believers said to be standing? Rev.
14:1, 3; compare 15:2-4. When are the 144,000 sealed? Rev.
6:17-7:3. What is the seal they receive? Rev. 14:1.

   In vision, John saw the sealed believers "on Mount Zion"
(Rev. 14:1, RSV). Mount Zion is in heaven: "But you have come
to Mount Zion . . . the heavenly Jerusalem" (Heb. 12:22, RSV;
compare Rev. 7:15). Revelation 14:1-5 depicts the scene of re-
joicing in heaven after the second coming of Jesus. (See John
14:1-3.)
   God's last-day living believers are sealed before the second
coming of Jesus. Revelation 7:1-3 explains that the seal of God
is given before the winds of strife are let loose upon our world
prior to the second advent of Christ.
   The seal that the 144,000 receive is the gift of God's charac-
ter by the Holy Spirit. They have "his name and his Father's
name written on their foreheads" (Rev. 14:1, RSV; compare
Rev. 3:12; 22:4). God's name and Christ's name are symbols of
their perfect character. (See Ps. 8:1; 18:49.) Christ's people re-
ceive His character by the gift of the Holy Spirit. (See Eph. 3:16-
19; Gal. 2:20; 1 John 3:7.) Even though the Holy Spirit has been
available to believers in every age, in a special measure He is
given to those who are sealed at the end of time, because they
need special power to overcome the "beast and his image"
(Rev. 13:11-18).
  What are the character qualifications of those who receive
the end-time seal of God? Rev. 14:4, 5.

   The sealed believers have resisted and overcome false reli-
gion. They "have not defiled themselves with women" (verse
4, RSV). An evil woman in prophecy represents false religion
(Rev. 17:4, 5). The sealed believers are honest, pure, and spirit-
ually faultless (Rev. 14:5), because Christ is reigning in their
hearts. Consequently, in the pre-advent judgment their names
are retained in the book of life (Rev. 3:5; Dan. 12:1).
  How are you making spiritual preparation to receive the
end-time seal of God? How are you assisting others in their
preparation for this experience?

                                                                 91

WHAT IS THE FIRST ANGEL'S MESSAGE? (Rev. 14:6, 7).
   Identify the four major elements in the first angel's mes-
sage. Rev. 14:6, 7.

   What is the "everlasting gospel"? The gospel is the good
news that Christ died for our sins and rose again (1 Cor. 15:1-
4). The gospel includes the good news that, because Christ
intercedes for us in the heavenly sanctuary, all our sins can be
forgiven (Acts 13:38, 39; 1 Tim. 2:5; 1 John 2:1). The gospel also
includes the good news that Christ's perfect righteousness is
both counted for us (Rom. 4:22-25) and bestowed upon us by
the Holy Spirit (1 John 3:24; Col. 1:27; Gal. 3:3). The gospel
announces to the world that Christ is coming again to give
immortality to His faithful people and to translate them to His
heavenly kingdom (Matt. 24:13, 14).
   What three truths are part of the gospel proclaimed by the
first angel? How do these truths relate to the gospel as de-
scribed above? Rev. 14:7.

   How can we give glory to the infinitely glorious God? Jesus
gave glory to His Father by His life of sacrifice and service and
by His infinite suffering on the cross (John 17:4). Every be-
liever is to witness for Christ by reflecting the glory of His
character (John 17:22, 23).
   What is the significance of the announcement, "the hour of
his judgment has come" (Rev. 14:7, RSV)? This announcement
is part of the "everlasting gospel" (verse 6). This judgment
takes place before the second coming of Jesus, because the
gospel is preached in all the world before He comes. Daniel
7:9-14 depicts the judgment in heaven before God destroys His
enemies and establishes the heavenly kingdom (verses 26, 27).
In this judgment, the faithful are vindicated (Dan. 7:22), and
the book of life is edited (Dan 12:1) on the basis of the spiritual
condition of professed believers (Rev. 3:5; 19:7, 8).
   We "worship him who made heaven and earth" (Rev. 14:7,
RSV) by observing God's Sabbath day as a memorial of His
creative works. (See Gen. 2:1-3; Ex. 20:8-11; Ex. 31:13.)
  How are you presenting this good news of the first angel's
message to others?

WHAT IS THE SECOND ANGEL'S MESSAGE? (Rev. 14:8;
18:1-4).

  What modern power is designated as "Babylon"? Com-
pare Rev. 14:8 with Gen. 10:8-10; 11:1-9; Isa. 13:1-11.


   Ancient Babylon founded by Nimrod became a symbol of
spiritual confusion and rejection of God. The neo-Babylonian
Empire, founded by Nebuchadnezzar in the late seventh cen-
tury B.C. (see Jer. 25:8-14), invaded Palestine three times (605,
597, 586 B.C.), taking the chosen people captive and finally
destroying Jerusalem. The Medes and Persians, ruled by Cyrus
the Great, conquered Babylon in 539 B.C. (See Isa. 44:28-45:6.)
   The book of Revelation alludes to the historical events of the
late seventh and early sixth centuries B.C. as examples of events
that will occur toward the end of history. Modern Babylon is
the false religious system of the last days from which the Lord
calls those who wish to serve Him. "Babylon is fallen" means
that, because Babylon is alive and powerful, God's people are
to come closer to Christ lest they should be taken spiritually
captive. "Babylon" (Rev. 14:8) summarizes the three-fold reli-
gious union of the last days that opposes God's truth and
people. (See Rev. 13; 16:13.) Any church is part of modern
"Babylon" that teaches nonbiblical doctrines.

  What final warning regarding Babylon does God inspire
His people to give to the world? Rev. 18:1-4.


   "The time will come when those who love God supremely
can no longer remain in connection with such as are 'lovers of
pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness,
but denying the power thereof.'
   "Revelation 18 points to the time when, as the result of
rejecting the threefold warning of Revelation 14:6-12, the church
will have fully reached the condition foretold by the second
angel, and the people of God still in Babylon will be called
upon to separate from her communion. This message is the last
that will ever be given to the world."—The Great Controversy,
p. 390.

   Does it help to tell members of other churches that they
are part of "Babylon"? What methods can you follow to per-
suade them to unite with the remnant church?

                                                               93
Wednesday                                         March 23
WHAT IS THE THIRD ANGEL'S MESSAGE? (Rev. 14:9-12).
  What three forces must be successfully resisted by those
who will be saved when Jesus comes? Rev. 14:9.

   Revelation 14:9 could be paraphrased: "Whoever worships
according to the dictates of 'Babylon' will not be saved." The
"beast" refers to the beast of Revelation 13:1-10. This animal is
a symbol of the medieval and modern papacy. The period of
42 prophetic months (Rev. 13:5), or 1260 days, symbolizes the
1260 years of papal supremacy (A.D. 538-1798). The deadly
wound (verse 3), received by the papacy in Europe at the end
of the French Revolution, has been healing progressively
throughout the twentieth century.
   The "image" to the beast is formed by the second beast of
Revelation 13:11-18. A modern replica of the medieval church-
state union will enforce a man-made system of worship
worldwide. The heart of this system of worship will be the
"mark" of the beast (Rev. 13:16, 17), the most significant sign
of papal religion. The sign or mark of God's authority is the
seventh-day Sabbath (Ex. 20:8-11; 31:13). The distinctive mark
of papal authority is the opposite—Sunday observance. On
the basis of Revelation 13, it is concluded that modern churches,
united with the papacy, will demand that secular authorities
around the world pass their decrees. God will exclude from
salvation anyone who, by accepting these religious decrees in
place of God's law, thus receives the mark of the beast.
  What are the distinguishing characteristics of God's people
who reject the beast, its image, and its mark? Rev. 14:12.

   The Bible teaches that salvation is by God's grace, given to
those who have faith. (See Eph. 2:8-10.) Works are not the
means of salvation. (See Rom. 3:20-24.) But works—obedience
to all of the Ten Commandments—are the expected and
inevitable result of faith in Christ. (See Rom. 3:31; 7:7; 8:3, 4;
Tames 2:10-12.)
  How can you present the fearful warning of the third
angel's messsage so that it is clearly good news? What is the
positive message implied by the negative warning?

Thursday                                          March 24
THE REAPING OF THE HARVEST (Rev. 14:14-20).

   How does John symbolize the salvation of believers at the
second coming of Jesus? Rev. 14:14-16.


   The Son of man bearing the sickle in His hand is Christ,
symbolized in this passage as corning to reap a harvest. John's
description in Revelation reminds us of Jesus' parable of the
wheat and the tares (Matt. 13:24-30). Referring to the faithful
and the unfaithful in the church, Jesus instructed that both be
allowed to "grow together until the harvest; and at harvest
time I will tell the reapers, Gather the weeds first and bind
them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my
barn" (Matt. 13:30, RSV).
    In His explanation of the parable, Jesus said, "The harvest
is the close of the age, and the reapers are angels" (Matt. 13:39,
RSV). The wheat represents the righteous who are taken to
heaven at Jesus' second coming. At that time the righteous
dead are raised and translated with the righteous living. (See
1 Thess. 4:16-18.)

  What vivid description did John give of the destruction of
the wicked? Rev. 14:17-20.


   "The figure of the two harvests is borrowed from the an-
cient Palestinian agricultural year, which consisted of two main
harvests, the grain harvest and the vintage. . . . Here the vin-
tage represents the wicked gathered for destruction."—SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 834.
   Note the times stipulated by Revelation for the punishment
of the wicked: (1) the seven last plagues (Rev. 15:5-16:21); (2)
the second coming of Jesus (Rev. 19:17-21; (3) the end of the
1,000 years (Rev. 20:9, 10, 14). The living wicked are put to
death at the second coming of Jesus. They will not live again
until the end of the millennium, when they will be raised to
face the final judgment.

   In presenting these truths, how can you explain that there
is no contradiction between the love and justice of God?
How can you harmonize God's punishment of unbelievers
with the truth of His infinite love for all? Would it be loving
for God to give the wicked eternal life?


                                                                95
Friday                                                March 25
FURTHER STUDY: Study the spiritual characteristics of the
dragon (Revelation 12), the beast (Rev. 13:1-10), and the "false
prophet" (Rev. 13:11-18; 16:13; 19:20).
   Read "God's Law Immutable," in The Great Controversy, pp.
433-450.

                             MY PLEDGE

        Because I realize the command to "go ye therefore and
     teach all nations" is a special invitation to me to share
     with others the peace, joy, and love that I have found in
     the Lord Jesus, I commit             (1-6 hours) each week to
     do some kind of personal work for Him. As the Lord
     gives me strength and health, and as circumstances al-
     low, it is my determination to share the Lord Jesus with
     others at every opportunity by: giving Bible studies
     visiting the needy ; helping the poor           , widows ,
     children ; telephoning           ; letter writing     ; giving
     (or mailing) missionary literature ; praying for the lost
          , for missionaries     , for church leaders , for the
     Global Mission program            ; other
     Name
     Date                          Place


DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. List the positive aspects of the three angels' messages.
     What do these messages instruct us to believe and do?
     2. What do the three angels' messages imply in regard to
        the mission of the church?
SUMMARY: The three angels' messages provide the heart of
the church's end-time proclamation to the world. The message
of the church is the rationale for its mission. Becasue Jesus will
soon return, we want all to have an opportunity to prepare for
that wonderful event. What a grand privilege God gives His
children, not only to know about these climactic events but to
share them with all people!
