   Educators have long known the power of visual aids. Jesus Himself often
used the objects of the visual world to teach His spiritual lessons effectively.
   Now this tremendous combination of the word spoken and the word seen is
available through the new adult Sabbath School theme videos.
   Professionally produced by the Church Ministries department, these videos
are a special blessing to Sabbath School students, shut-ins, small groups, and
isolated members.
    Available each quarter from your Adventist Book Center.

            Introduction to the
          Three Angels' Messages
                     Last Call for Heaven


   God's redeeming love is the central theme of the Bible. In
ways that appeal to every faculty of our being and every avenue
of our experience, each book of Scripture reveals Christ as our
Saviour. Drawing together the accumulated and progressive light
of the ages, the book of Revelation points us to Jesus, the Lamb of
God, who takes away the sin of the world. In this final book of
Scripture He is exalted above every earthly attraction and power
as He ministers for the salvation and enlightenment of humanity
and the protection of His redeemed.
    The three angels' messages of Revelation 14:6-12 bring the
themes of the everlasting gospel into keen focus. They give us
safe guidance in an age of relativism, doubt, counterfeit gospels,
and lying wonders. These angels speak to help us both discern
error and appreciate the truth as it is in Jesus.
    We shall better understand the content, purpose, and unity of
the three angels' messages if we bear in mind their prominent
characteristics.
   1.These messages are the everlasting gospel, permeated with
light, life, and love. Even in their sternest features, their purpose
is, not to condemn, but to save us. Rejection, however, invites the
judgment of God.
    2.They apply with equal relevance to all the world, excluding
no person, culture, or condition of humankind.
    3. They are highly concentrated, summarizing divine revela-
tion in a celestial shorthand. We can best understand their intent
by studying them phrase by phrase in sequence, letting Scripture
explain itself. We do not, however, want to lose sight of their
organic unity, for they blend into one harmonious appeal to
earth's last generation. They contain no chord that clashes with
the essential truth that God is love.
    4. Finally, we should consider these messages in light of the
world conditions they address. Christ and His prophets forecast
the unparalleled evil, error, and turmoil of our time. It is no
wonder that these messages are distinguished by urgency and
depth of concern for the human family in its current plight.
    We have every reason to thank God for the all-sufficiency of
His answers found in the three angels' messages. They teach us
 to follow the Lamb wherever He leads.
                                                                    9

              Angels With a
              Global Mission



Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Rev. 14:1-12; Luke 2:13,
14.
     MEMORY TEXT: "Are not all angels ministering spirits
     sent to serve those who will inherit salvation?" (Hebrews
     1:14, NIV).
   KEY THOUGHT: The three angels' messages of Revelation
14 are meant for everyone in all parts of the world. Because
God desires us to share this message, He will give us the
resources to help us do so.
   LED BY AN ANGEL. Daniel lived in the lush highlands of
western Tanzania. One night a heavenly messenger visited
Daniel in his mud-and-pole hut with the following message:
"Go to the hospital high on the hill. They have the truth of
God, and it will change your life. After you have learned about
God's message, you must take .it to the Rundi area." After two
years of study in a baptismal class at the Seventh-day Adventist
Heri Hospital, Daniel moved to the Rundi country, where, as a
result of his preaching, there arose a Seventh-day Adventist
congregation to proclaim the three angels' messages. (Adapted
from Robert H. Pierson, 501 Illustrations, p. 49.)
   Christ promised that His gospel will reach all the world
(Matt. 24:14). He has provided for everyone to be saved (1 John
2:2). His final proclamation of truth (Rev. 14:6-12) is designed
to reach all humanity with its diverse cultures, political, and
social conditions. The three angels' messages take into account
every phase of human experience and history. We are to live
and teach this truth under the direction of the Holy Spirit and
heaven's angels.

A STRICKEN WORLD (Matt. 24:3-14).
   How does the Bible describe world conditions during the
time of the gospel's final proclamation? Matt. 24:3-14 (com-
pare 2 Tim. 3:1-5; 2 Peter 3:3, 4).

   Recall recent news reports. Did they include stories of natu-
ral disasters, wars, greed, and unholiness? Have such reports
increased over the past few years? The present state of world
affairs leaves people confused and demoralized. Because of its
shallow concept of salvation and its disregard for God's law,
Christendom is largely powerless. In desperation, people have
turned to false religions that, appealing to carnal human na-
ture, leave them essentially unchanged. They envision para-
dise without purity, freedom without accountability, happi-
ness without holiness, and riches without integrity. While
society crumbles, governments feed their people with false
hopes of a new world order ushered in by human prowess.
Sensing the futility of this promise, some take "refuge" in
cynicism, despair, crime, or other antisocial behavior.
   But God refuses to abandon us to ruin. He "so loved the
world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in Him
should not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16, RSV). He
pleads with ardent love, "Turn to me and be saved, all the ends
of the earth! For I am God, and there is no other" (Isa. 45:22,
RSV). He does not wish "that any should perish, but that all
should reach repentance" (2 Peter 3:9, RSV).
   How does God want His people to live in the midst of
these turbulent and trying days? Phil. 2:14-16. What is the
source of our power to live this way? 1 Peter 1:3-5; Eph. 3:16-
20.

   God weighs and measures all our trials and offers strength
proportionate to our needs. "The Lord will have a people as
true as steel, and with a faith as firm as the granite rock. They
are to be His witnesses in the world, His instrumentalities to
do a special, a glorious work in the day of His preparation."
—Testimonies, vol. 4, pp. 594, 595.

   Ask God now to strengthen your faith and guide you to a
 witnessing opportunity this week.

                                                              11
Monday                                       September 26
HEAVEN'S HELP (Ps. 91:10-12).
   God looks with loving pity upon this suffering world. He
sees Satan's cruel devices to deepen our misery. And even
though we have often cooperated with the archenemy to our
own and others' injury, God does not lightly give us up to our
ruinous ways (Hosea 11:8). At Calvary He made full provision
to ransom us from the one who is stronger than we.
  What resources has God provided to rescue us from sin?
How has each of these resources kept you spiritually safe?
Rom. 5:6-8
Rom. 8:14,15
Eph. 6:11-18
Ps. 91:11,12
  "What an ocean of love is circulating, like a divine atmos-
phere, around the world!"—That I May Know Him, p. 19.
   How deep is God's desire for us to receive the gift of His
salvation? 1 Tim. 2:3, 4; 2 Peter 3:9.

   God is willing to help us. He lovingly strives to awaken in
us an awareness of our real condition and desperate need. He
moves with might and speed to help us, to save us from our
sins, and initiate us into the glorious life of His kingdom.
"Every one that will submit to be ransomed, Christ will rescue
from the pit of corruption and from the briers of sin. . . . Do not
think that perhaps God will pardon your transgressions and
permit you to come into His presence. God has made the first
advance. While you were in rebellion against Him, He went
forth to seek you. . . . The soul, bruised and wounded and
ready to perish, He encircles with His arms of love and joyfully
bears it to the fold of safety."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 188,
189.

   Think of times when God mercifully protected you from
 spiritual disaster. Ponder the effects of His love upon your
 heart. Ask God to help you make His love more clearly
 known to a neighbor or work associate this week.

THE MINISTRY OF ANGELS (Heb. 1:7, 14).

   Today we will explore the close connection between God's
earthly witnesses and the angels of heaven as implied in Rev-
elation 14:6.

  How are angels of God described? Heb. 1:7, 14.


  To what kind of people are angels especially near? Ps.
34:7. Besides protecting us, what other work do angels do for
our benefit? Acts 7:53; Rev. 1:1.


   "While some are in the valley of decision, angels are uniting
with true, wholehearted servants of Christ to help these needy
souls.
   "If angels occupied the place of man in the administration of
the gospel, there would not be whole regions left in darkness
and the shadow of death. The work would have been as it is
represented by the angel flying in the midst of heaven pro-
claiming the everlasting gospel to them that dwell on the earth.
But the Lord does nothing without the cooperation of man. . . .
   "Angelic agencies, though invisible, are cooperating with
visible human agencies, forming a relief association with men.
Is there not something stimulating and inspiring in this thought
that the human agent stands as the visible instrument to confer
the blessings of angelic agencies? . . . Human agencies are the
hands of heavenly instrumentalities, for heavenly agencies
employ human hands in practical ministry. . . . This is Heaven's
way of administering saving power. The knowledge and ac-
tions of the heavenly order of workers, united with the knowl-
edge and power which are imparted to human agencies, re-
lieve the oppressed and distressed."—My Life Today, pp. 304,
305.

   Review the activities of angels in the rapid growth of the
early church. Acts 1:10, 11; 10:7, 30; 12:7.


    Can you testify to the way God has guided you in special
 ways as you have worked for others? Why not thank God
 now that He has provided His angels to work with and
 through you to win souls? Claim the presence of the angels
 in your witness this week.

                                                              13
Wednesday                                   September 28
MESSENGERS OF LOVE (Rev. 14:6).

  The mission of the church is to spread the gospel to the
world. God uses angels to work in close partnership with His
church to draw the world to Christ.

     What is the identity of the angel in Revelation 14:6?


    The Greek word used here for angel means "messenger" as
it is sometimes translated in the King James. These messengers
can be humans (Mark 1:2; Luke 7:24; 9:52; James 2:25). When a
person speaks under divine inspiration, or in faithful harmony
with Scripture, the message borne is no less authoritative than
if a heavenly angel or God Himself spoke it directly (Matt.
10:40, 41; 1 Thess. 2:13).
    "This is a symbolic vision. The angel represents God's saints
engaged in the task of proclaiming the everlasting gospel,
especially the features mentioned in this verse, at a time when
the 'judgment is come' (v. 7). It is, of course, also true that
literal angels assist men in the task of proclaiming the gospel,
but this is not the predominant idea here."—SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 7, p. 827.

  Since these angels primarily represent God's people who
bear the everlasting gospel to the world, why are they repre-
sented as flying in the midst of heaven (Rev. 14:6)?


   "The angel's flight 'in the midst of heaven,' and the 'loud
voice' with which the warning is uttered, and its promulgation
to all 'that dwell on the earth'—'to every nation, and kindred,
and tongue, and people'—give evidence of the rapidity and
worldwide extent of the movement."—The Great Controversy,
p. 355.
   "The love of Christ, revealed to us, makes us debtorg to all
who know Him not. God has given us light, not for ourselves
alone, but to shed upon them."—Steps to Christ, p. 81.

  List some ways or ministries by which the church can
carry (or is carrying) the gospel to the world. Also list some
ways in which you are involved in gospel work.

GOD'S UNIVERSAL LOVE (Eph. 2:11-22).
  The three angels clearly set forth God's impartial-but-
personal love for "every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and
people." The whole world is His parish.
   What does the following parable reveal about Christ's
view of people from diverse backgrounds? Luke 10:25-37.

   Comment on the effect of the cross of Christ concerning
relations between different cultures, nationalities, and races.
Eph. 2:11-22.

   "He who is closely connected with Christ is lifted above the
prejudice of color or caste. . . . The divine Author of truth is to
be uplifted. Our hearts are to be filled with the faith that works
by love and purifies the soul. The work of the good Samaritan
is the example that we are to follow."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p.
209.
   The messages of the three angels enlarge human sympathy,
intellect, and experience. These messages are designed to make
us reformers and benefactors. Christ has commissioned His
church to make faithful disciples of all nations (Matt. 28:19,
20). We should expect, then, that the final proclamation of the
gospel will direct us to all needed instruction on how to live
wholly for God.
    "Every feature of the third angel's message is to be pro-
claimed in all parts of the world. This is a much greater work
than many realize. . . .
    "This message is a testing message. Received into honest
hearts, it will prove an antidote for all the world's sins and
sorrows. No conditions of climate, of poverty, of ignorance, or
of prejudice can hinder its efficiency, or lessen its adaptability
to the needs of mankind."—The Upward Look, p. 277. [Often in
the Spirit of Prophecy writings and in Seventh-day Adventist
terminology, the phrase third angel's message is a reference to
the threefold message of Revelation 14:6-12 and does not refer
exclusively to the words of the third angel alone.]

    Does any open or hidden prejudice find room in your
 life? Are you willing to let God's love lift you above this
 sin? In what practical ways can we cooperate with Christ in

FURTHER STUDY: Ponder the interrelationship between God,
human beings, and angels in conveying the message of salvation
to a stricken world as you read the following texts: Luke 15:10;
John 1:51; 1 Timothy 5:21; 1 Peter 1:9-12; Revelation 22:8, 9.
    Read also "Agency of Evil Spirits," in The Great Controversy,
pp. 511-517; The Desire of Ages, pp. 143, 240; The Acts of the
Apostles, pp. 152-154; Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 79, 231, 236.

   "Let me tell you that the Lord will work in this last work in a
manner very much out of the common order of things, and in a
way that will be contrary to any human planning. There will be
those among us who will always want to control the work of
God, to dictate even what movements shall be made when the
work goes forward under the direction of the angel who joins
the third angel in the message to be given to the world. God
will use ways and means by which it will be seen that He is
taking the reins in His own hands."—Testimonies to Ministers,
p. 300.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Write one or more ways in which this lesson has
     strengthened your appreciation of Heaven's interest in
     the salvation of humankind.

     2. How can you cooperate with Heaven's angels in pro-
        claiming the gospel to the world? What changes do you
        need to make in your life so that you can fully unite with
        God and His angels in this special work?

     3. This lesson has emphasized the intensity and urgency of
        God's desire to make Himself known to a spiritually
        dark world. How can you make sure you are a child of
        light, living in close partnership with God as His wit-
        ness?

SUMMARY: How deeply God loves us! He sees our world
blighted and alienated by sin. Longing to save all people, He
sends them a message coupled with a mission for His people.
He plans to redeem all who will say Yes to Him. To accomplish
our salvation, He mobilizes all the resources of His infinite
love and wisdom. He works through men, women, and chil-
dren to declare and exhibit His love. He supports all willing
helpers with angels who are strong and skilled to do His bid-
ding. With overflowing power and grace, God's final message
of salvation is to go to all the world. Let us unite with Him in
this grand enterprise.

              The Man With a Black Book
                        James H. Zachary

    The sun disappeared behind the hills of Central Sulawesi,
Indonesia as we hiked up a narrow jungle trail. In the darkness
we stumbled over fallen trees, slippery stones, and across logs
that bridged rushing streams. The three-hour hike stretched to
seven hours before we arrived at the tiny village hidden among
jungle spice orchards.
    Quickly I fell asleep on my bed of rough boards with no
mattress or blankets, and awoke to the sound of children at
play.
     The local Adventist church elder invited me to his home.
Like most of the villagers, the elder lives in a tree house high
above the clove orchards. In the days of tribal wars, villagers
found safety from enemies by climbing into their tree houses
and pulling their ladders up after them.
    The elder's wife, with an infant tied to her hip, quickly
mounted the 30-foot bamboo ladder to her house. "Come on
in," he invited, ascending the ladder. Slowly I climbed the
rickety steps, certain that my weight would break the slender
bamboo steps that led to their two-room house. Gingerly I sat
down in the doorway, enjoying the sights and sounds of the
village as he told me a story.
    Many years before, a village woman dreamed that a man
came into the village carrying a black book. The villagers
gathered around the stranger as he spoke. "Friends I have
 brought with me the Book of the God of heaven. This book
 tells us about Jesus, who died for our sins, and about the
 Sabbath of God."
    Years passed. Then one day a pastor hiked over the same trail
 on which I had walked. He carried a Bible and spoke the same
 words that the woman had heard in her dream years before.
    The woman shouted in joy, "Brothers, this man has a
 message from God for us!" Today almost everyone in the
 village is a church member. They have carried the gospel of
                     the black Book to 11 neighboring villages.
                         Thousands of villages still wait for some-
                      one to bring the story of Jesus. Will you
                      help?

     The Everlasting Gospel




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Rev. 14:6, 7; Rom. 1:16,
17; 5:1, 2; Col. 1:20-23.
     MEMORY TEXT: "And I saw another angel fly in the
     midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach
     unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and
     kindred, and tongue, and people" (Revelation 14:6).
   KEY THOUGHT: The gospel is the good news that Jesus
saves us from sin and restores us to fellowship with God. The
cross of Jesus is the focal point of that good news.
   FROM MIMIC TO MINISTER. William Miller's skepti-
cism regarding religion caused him to entertain his friends by
mimicking his grandfather, who was a minister. But one day in
May of 1816, he took God's name in vain, and instantly became
convinced of his sinfulness. Finally, he testified, "When brought
almost to despair, God by His Holy Spirit opened my eyes. I
saw Jesus as a friend, and my only help, and the Word of God
as the perfect rule of duty."—Francis D. Nichol, The Midnight
Cry (Washington, D.C.: Review and Herald, 1944), p. 28. Miller
then began to devote himself to prayer and Bible study. The
gospel changed him from a cursing mimic to the leader of a
religious movement that set the stage for the Seventh-day
Adventist Church.
   Miller learned that the gospel reveals God's character of
love manifested in the plan of salvation. He also learned that
through the gospel, healing waters flow into bitter, barren
lives to bring forth the fruit of holiness, happiness, and health.
The three angels' messages present the whole gospel in con-
centrated form.

THE GOSPEL DEFINED (Rom. 1:16, 17).

  Romans 1:16,17 explicitly defines the gospel. Analyze these
verses by filling in the blanks below.

The gospel is the power of             unto

This power is to                                who believes.

The gospel reveals the                                 of God.

His righteousness is received by

Persons who have faith live                              lives.

   Although the gospel comes to us in words, those words
describe the experience by which we are re-created through the
indwelling of the Holy Spirit. The gospel comes from and leads
us to Christ, the living Word (John 1:1-5, 12-14). Our word
gospel is from the Anglo-Saxon god-spell, which conveys the
meaning of "good tidings" and "God's story." From the Greek
term, we derive the word evangelism. The gospel is the good
news about God's saving power and mercy for the lost.

  How do the following verses describe the gospel?

2 Cor. 9:13—the gospel of

Matt. 24:14—the gospel of

Eph. 1:13—the gospel of

Acts 20:24—the gospel of

Rom. 10:15—the gospel of

   "A great work is to be accomplished in setting before men
the saving truths of the gospel. This is the means ordained by
God to stem the tide of moral corruption. This is His means of
restoring His moral image in man. It is His remedy for univer-
sal disorganization. It is the power that draws men together in
unity. To present these truths is the work of the third angel's
message."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 11.

    What can you do to increase your own knowledge of and
 interest in the gospel?

THE EVERLASTING GOSPEL (Ex. 34:5-7; Rom. 8:33-39).

   What evidence is there of the gospel's everlasting charac-
ter?

Gen. 22:1-14; Gal. 3:8

Phil. 2:5-11

1 Peter 1:18-20

Rev. 13:8

   "[The plan of redemption] was an unfolding of the prin-
ciples that from eternal ages have been the foundation of God's
throne. From the beginning, God and Christ knew of the apos-
tasy of Satan, and of the fall of man through the deceptive
power of the apostate. God did not ordain that sin should
exist, but He foresaw its existence, and made provision to meet
the terrible emergency."—The Desire of Ages, p. 22.

   What does the everlasting gospel reveal about God's char-
acter? Ex. 34:5-7; Rom. 8:33-39; Heb. 13:8.


   The implications of the eternal existence of the gospel are
measureless. God plans for us to have an eternally expanding
appreciation for His character and purpose (Eph. 3:16-21;
1 Cor. 2:9). He does not offer us a casual acquaintance or a
generalized goodwill that overlooks our individual being. Nor
does He scatter His bounties with impersonal profusion, re-
quiring us only to gather up the blessings He leaves behind.
Everything He does is designed to bring us into the closest and
most ennobling union with Himself, an alliance that gives us a
name because it bonds us intimately to Him (Isa. 56:5; John
17:21-26; Rom. 8:32). Throughout eternity the redeemed will
obtain a constantly broader and higher experience of Christ's
righteousness and the matchless wonders of His love (Ps. 36:5-
9; 27:4; The Great Controversy, pp. 677, 678).


   Meditate on God's goodness. Ask Him to give you an
 enriched fellowship with Christ, through His Holy Spirit.
 Make use of opportunities that come your way to express
 God's goodness to others in word and deed.

CALVARY, THE KEYSTONE OF THE GOSPEL (John 12:32).
    The foundation of the gospel is Christ's sacrifice on Calvary.
It is to this sacrifice and all its transforming power that the first
angel's message points.
   Why is the cross so important? John 12:32; 1 Peter 1:18, 19.

   We cannot exalt the cross of Christ too highly or explore its
significance too deeply. It is the means of salvation. It is the
key that unlocks the treasure house of all truth. Sin has so
darkened our understanding that only the blood of Christ can
cleanse our spiritual and intellectual perceptions and purify us
from all sin (1 John 1:7; Col. 1:19-23; Eph. 2:12, 13).
   "This is the highest science we can learn—the science of
salvation. The cross of Calvary, rightly regarded, is true phi-
losophy, pure and undefiled religion. It is eternal life to all
who believe."—Sons and Daughters of God, p. 231.
   What the devil meant to be a crude, bloody lynching turned
out to be the most exalted exhibition of God's love. "The sacri-
fice of Christ as an atonement for sin is the great truth around
which all other truths cluster. . . . Those who study the Redeemer's
wonderful sacrifice grow in grace and knowledge."—Sons and
Daughters of God, p. 221.

  The Bible presents Christ's cross as an instrument both of
death and of life, as the following texts show:
Who died and for whom? 1 Cor. 15:3
Who lives with Christ? Rom. 6:8

What dies and how? Rom. 6:10,11
For whom and for what do we live? 2 Cor. 5:15-21
   Peter and Paul found in the cross great spiritual illumina-
tion. It was to them the tree of life, the fountain of pardon,
cleansing, and restoration. It was the moral chart and compass
of their existence.


    How can the cross become the spiritual taproot of my
 life, as it was for Peter and Paul?

                                                                   21
Wednesday                                          October 5
THE GOSPEL AND CHRIST'S SACRIFICE (1 Cor. 1:18).
   Christ's sacrifice embraces the whole plan of salvation, re-
vealing to us (1) the great controversy between good and evil
and (2) God's perfect solution to the problem of sin. Christ's
sacrifice makes it possible for us to be redeemed from sin and
reconciled to God.
     How did Paul perceive the cross? 1 Cor. 1:18; 1 Cor. 15:3, 4.

   What seemed to be the embodiment of weakness and defeat
is really the grandest exhibition of strength and victory—the
strength and victory of love over hate, of truth over lies, of life
over death, of salvation over condemnation. We must always
remember that Christ's death on the cross was voluntary (John
10:17, 18) in order that we might be pardoned and reconciled
to God (Rom. 5:10). Moreover, He arose from the dead to grant
us victory over all sin through His indwelling power (Rom.
8:3, 4). These great gospel facts should command our constant
attention. They are not only a doctrine; they are the ground of
our hope and the warranty of our future. Calvary explains it
all—God's abhorrence of sin, His love for the sinner, and the
true worth of our souls.
   What benefits can we personally appropriate from the re-
deeming sacrifice and work of Jesus? Eph. 1:5-7; Heb. 10:9,
10, 14-23.

   From pardon to Paradise, the atonement spans the whole
range of blessings that come to repentant sinners. And every
blessing we receive refers us to Jesus' sacrifice. "We are to have
free access to the atoning blood of Christ. This we must regard
as the most precious privilege, the greatest blessing, ever granted
to sinful man. . . . How deep, how wide and continuous is this
stream! To every soul thirsting after holiness there is repose,
there is rest, there is the quickening influence of the Holy
Spirit, and then the holy, happy, peaceful walk and precious
communion with Christ."—Sons and Daughters of God, p. 226.
   Why did Christ have to die in order for us to be saved?
 How does His death affect my life and experience with
 Him? Pray that the Holy Spirit will illuminate your mind
 with a growing appreciation of Christ's sacrifice.

THE GOSPEL PROCLAIMED (Col. 1:25-29).
   All who are truly converted by Christ will hunger to tell
others about Him. Under the inspiration of the Spirit, this will
be the foremost purpose of their lives.
   What was the chief interest of converts to Christ in Bible
times? Col. 1:25-29; Eph. 3:6-11.

   "No sooner does one come to Christ than there is born in his
heart a desire to make known to others what a precious friend
he has found in Jesus. . . . If we are clothed with the righteous-
ness of Christ and are filled with the joy of His indwelling
Spirit, we shall not be able to hold our peace. . . . We shall seek
to present to . . . [others] the attractions of Christ and the
unseen realities of the world to come. There will be an intensity
of desire to follow in the path that Jesus trod. There will be an
earnest longing that those around us may 'behold the Lamb of
God, which taketh away the sin of the world.' "—Steps to Christ,
pp. 78, 79.
  Why does God commission human beings to teach others
the gospel? Rom. 10:13-15; John 1:6, 7. Is it possible for those
who do not hear the gospel taught to be saved? Rom. 2:11-16.

   In what manner are we to present Christ and His gospel to
others? 1 Thess. 1:5 (compare 2:4-8; 1 John 1:1-4).

   "The gospel is to be presented, not as a lifeless theory, but as
a living force to change the life. God would have His servants
bear testimony to the fact that through His grace men may
possess Christlikeness of character, and may rejoice in the as-
surance of His great love. He would have us bear testimony to
the fact that He can not be satisfied until all who will accept
salvation are reclaimed, and reinstated to their holy privileges
as His sons and daughters."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 99.
   What correlation does today's lesson have with the proc-
 lamation of the first angel's message? Ask God to give you
 opportunities to share Christ with someone this week in
 some way that will benefit their lives.

FURTHER STUDY: Reread at least two of the four accounts of
Christ's death on the cross: Matthew 27:24-54; Mark 15:15-41;
Luke 23:13-49; John 19:13-37.
  Also read Sons and Daughters of God, pp. 220-230.
   "The gospel is glorious because it is made up of His right-
eousness. It is Christ unfolded, and Christ is the gospel embod-
ied. Every page of the New Testament Scriptures shines with
His light. Every text is a diamond, touched and irradiated by
the divine rays.
   "We are not to praise the gospel, but praise Christ. We are
not to worship the gospel, but the Lord of the gospel."—Ellen
G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 907.
 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How has this lesson made the cross more real to you
     personally?
     2. Relate Paul's idea of being crucified to the world (Gal.
        6:14) with being an active witness to the world.
     3. What effect does Christ's sacrifice have on our pride,
        personal ambitions, and attitude toward others, includ-
        ing those who dislike us? How does the cross affect our
        home life?

     4. Why is the understanding of the true gospel so important
        that Scripture pronounces a strong curse upon those who
        teach a false gospel? (Gal. 1:6-9).
     5. How would you help a person who says, "I have ac-
        cepted the gospel, but I do not have peace"?
SUMMARY: The everlasting gospel, which is the essential
content of the three angels' messages, exalts the sacrifice of
Christ and all the benefits that result from His death and resur-
rection. The Holy Spirit and all the powers of heaven are di-
rected to exalting the cross because at the cross are revealed the
love, wisdom, power, and saving grace of God. As we person-
ally accept Christ's sacrifice for us, we shall die to our sins, and
our lives will become transformed into His likeness. It is the
privilege and desire of all who have been redeemed by Christ
to make Him known to others through proclamation and un-
selfish service.

OMANI A
                               Olivia's Decision
      Sig7                         Adly Campos

             Night after night 11-year-old Olivia sat alone on the front
          row, absorbed in the Family Life Seminar I was presenting in
          her church. She seemed mature far beyond her age.
              At the end of the first week of meetings, I asked those who
          wanted to give their lives to Jesus through baptism to come
          forward. Without hesitation Olivia jumped up and walked to
          the podium.
              Following the meeting, Olivia approached me and said in a
          quiet, almost pleading voice, "I want to give my heart to Jesus,
          to be baptized. But I fear my parents. I don't think that they
          will allow me to be baptized."
              Olivia had been reared in a Catholic home. Her uncle, a
          Seventh-day Adventist, had taken her to Sabbath School and
          church for a year. Olivia was a decisive girl whose heart had
          been touched by the Spirit of God.
              I offered to visit her parents. When I arrived at Olivia's
          home, she introduced me to her father, and we sat down to talk.
          After congratulating him for the decision Olivia had made, I
          told him that there were very few persons her age who had such
          a good perception of spiritual things.
              Olivia's father felt that she was too young to take such a
          serious step. "She has never been to a dance, taken a glass of
          liquor, or smoked a cigarette; she doesn't know what social life
          is. Therefore, I think she is not ready to make such a decision,"
          he stated.
              I shared my personal testimony. "I was baptized at 9 years
          of age. I had never drunk wine or smoked a cigarette, and my
          social life has revolved around the church." I explained that I
          had never regretted not smoking, drinking, or dancing.
              For each excuse the father gave, the Lord supplied an
          answer. Finally, Olivia's father agreed that she could be
          baptized. The last Sabbath of the meetings Olivia was bap-
          tized. Her father witnessed her baptism, and decided to attend
                                church with Olivia. God used a child's
                                faith to bring her father to church.

                     Fear God




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Rev. 14:7; Ps. 34:7-22;
112:1, 7; 130:4; Heb. 12:28.

     MEMORY TEXT: "The Lord confides in those who fear
     him; he makes his covenant known to them" (Psalm 25:14,
     NIV).

    KEY THOUGHT: Godly fear (love and reverence for God)
is the foundation of a healthy religious experience. It opens the
way to all the blessings of the gospel and preserves us against
evil.

   THE FEAR OF THE LORD. David Livingstone had been in
Africa for 16 years. But he had never been so afraid before.
Surrounded by hostile natives, he was in danger of losing his
life. As he contemplated escaping, he read Christ's words in
Matthew 28:18-20. His Saviour's command to teach all nations
and His promise, "Lo, I am with you alway," changed his fear
of death into fear of the Lord. His life was spared, and he was
enabled to continue his work.
   Fearing God as spoken of in Revelation 14:7 means to ap-
proach Him with reverence and awe. "It conveys the thought
of absolute loyalty to God, of full surrender to His will."
—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 827. Such fear banishes all
destructive fears and brings us into peaceful intimacy with
God. While such fear teaches us not to trifle with His patience
and mercy, it also teaches us to rely on Him for guidance. The
first angel's call to approach God with reverence and awe is
especially crucial now, when so many people everywhere wor-
ship gods of their own making.

Sunday                                           October 9
THE NEED OF GODLY FEAR (Eccl. 12:13, 14).
   John Newton, sea captain, was once a slave dealer who had
no regard for God or his fellow humans. But after years of
hard living, he himself was captured and sold as a slave. While
in captivity he recalled the teachings and prayers of his godly
mother and became overwhelmed for the first time by his sins.
Then he remembered Christ's merciful sacrifice for sinners,
repented, and gave his heart to Jesus. Out of that experience
was born his hymn "Amazing Grace." A line in that hymn
says, " 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my
fears relieved."
   Christ's grace leads us to realize our lost condition and the
inevitable result. But when we respond to Christ's love, His
grace replaces human fear with godly fear. No longer are we
afraid of condemnation, because we are delighted to be re-
lieved of it (Rom. 8:1). Fellowship with Christ imparts to us a
new and legitimate sense of security.
  What are the characteristics of godly fear?
Ex. 20:20
Lev. 25:17
Deut. 5:29
Prov. 8:13
   While at a dinner with some friends, Daniel Webster (1782-
1852; American statesman and orator) was noticeably silent.
After the table talk subsided, one of the company inquired,
"Mr. Webster, what is the greatest idea which you have ever
considered?" After a few moments' reflection, Webster re-
plied, "The most important idea which occupies my mind and
is ever before me, is that of my personal accountability to God
for all my thoughts, words, and actions." This sober idea is
embodied in the words of the wise man: "Let us hear the
conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his com-
mandments: for this is the whole duty of man. For God shall
bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether
it be good, or whether it be evil" (Eccl. 12:13, 14).

GODLY FEAR AND CARNAL FEAR DISTINGUISHED
(Prov. 29:25).

   Revelation 14 presents two contrasting types of fear: (1) fear
of persecution if God's way is accepted; (2) fear of God, that
leads to obedience to His will. In each person's life, one fear
will eliminate the other.

   What is the effect of fearing people? Prov. 29:25; John 9:18-
23; 12:42, 43.


   In Matthew 10:28-32, Jesus taught that even if people threaten
to harm us because of our faith, we should not fear them more
than we reverence God. No one but God has any rightful
power over our conscience. And no one has divine sanction to
exercise dominion over our faith or religious practice. The
Lord stands by His faithful children. Although we should be
law-abiding citizens, our loyalty to God has priority. God cau-
tions us not to allow fear of others to shame us out of our faith
or restrain us from obedience to Him (Acts 4:19, 20; 5:29; Isa.
51:7-11).
   The most grievous kind of earthly fear results from accept-
ing a distorted view of God's character that causes us to be
afraid of Him.

   What effort did the Lord deplore in the days of Isaiah? Isa.
29:13.

   "It is Satan's constant effort to misrepresent the character of
God, the nature of sin, and the real issues at stake in the great
controversy. His sophistry lessens the obligation of the divine
law and gives men license to sin. At the same time he causes
them to cherish false conceptions of God so that they regard
Him with fear and hate rather than with love. The cruelty
inherent in his own character is attributed to the Creator; it is
embodied in systems of religion and expressed in modes of
worship." —The Great Controversy, p. 569.

   Were you ever afraid of God, in the sense of dread?
Why? How did you overcome that fear? If you have not,
how can you do so?
   A fellow Christian expresses to you a negative fear of
God. How can you help that person understand and de-
velop true godly fear?

THE BLESSINGS OF GODLY FEAR (Jer. 32:38-40).

   The everlasting covenant is the basis of the everlasting gos-
pel. God's gift of reverence empowers us to be loyal without
being coerced. It also helps to counter the trend toward disre-
spectful familiarity. A widespread characteristic of modern so-
ciety is irreverence. Blasphemy, self-worship, and flippancy
pertaining to holy things are common. Such irreverence results
in the degeneration of all aspects of life. The revival of rever-
ence for God leads to improved quality of life. The Hebrew
word is translated in the King James Version as both "rever-
ence" and "fear." (Compare Ps. 33:8 with Ps. 89:7.) "Christ's
followers today should guard against the tendency to lose the
spirit of reverence and godly fear."—Prophets and Kings, p. 48.

  Identify some of the blessings associated with the fear of
God as given in each of the following texts:
Ps. 31:19
Ps. 85:9
Ps. 112:1
Ps. 130:3, 4

   Scripture is full of refreshing surprises. What may appear on
the surface to be forbidding, we discover to be delightful and
attractive. True fear of God is like this. Instead of being cold,
stern, and rigorous, it overflows with grace and comfort. Isaiah
calls the fear of the Lord a "treasure" (Isa. 33:6) because it
keeps the heart for God and makes it receptive to Heaven's
choicest blessings (Prov. 22:4; compare Heb. 12:28).
   Who lacks the fear of God?
Prov. 1:24, 29, 30

   Do you see the fear of God as a positive experience, to be
 cultivated in your life? Why do you think the first angel's
 message begins with a call to fear God?

THE FRUIT OF GODLY FEAR (Mal. 3:16-18).
   The first angel's call to fear God is a positive command. But
every command of the Lord is a promise. The fruit of obedi-
ence is blessed beyond description or calculation. The Lord
does not wish us to be in terror of Him. He does want us to be
free from the light, flippant attitude toward holy things that
blights our age. The fear of the Lord prevents a loss of spiritu-
ality. It is also a stimulus to obey God's will as stated in His
Word. Godly fear instills in us a healthy self-distrust. It shields
us against hasty, overconfident acts that would hurt others
and misrepresent Jesus. It gives us strength of character to do
what is right in the face of opposition, misunderstanding, and
mockery.
   Concerning Daniel and his companions, Ellen White wrote,
"The fear of God, which is the beginning of wisdom, was the
foundation of their greatness."—Messages to Young People, p.
243.
  What are some of the fruits that come to those who fear
God?
Ps. 34:7, 9
Ps. 85:9
Mal. 3:16-18
1 John 4:18
   What a picture emerges from the study of these texts! Godly
fear, instead of being an oppressive burden, is the very means
by which God gives us holiness, peace, joy, and deliverance
from all carnal fears that enslave and paralyze the soul. "For
you who fear [reverence] my name the sun of righteousness
shall rise, with healing in its wings" (Mal. 4:2, RSV). They will
hear Him say, "Fear thou not [do not be afraid]; for I am with
thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee;
yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand
of my righteousness" (Isa. 41:10).
  What implications does today's lesson have on the ac-
ceptance or rejection of the three angels' messages?
  How can godly fear make you a happier and wiser per-
son?

EXEMPLARS OF GODLY FEAR (Rev. 15:1-4).
   Spiritual lessons are often best learned by studying the lives
of people who embody the faults or virtues we wish to con-
sider. Today we will examine the character and influence of
persons in Scripture who had the fear of God.
  Who is the first person mentioned in the Bible as fearing
God? Gen. 22:12.

   This is significant because Abraham is specially noted as the
father of the faithful and is distinguished by his obedience to
God (Rom. 4:9-17; Gal. 3:6-9; Gen. 22:16-18; 26:5). Godly fear,
faith, and obedience are compatible qualities. When they flour-
ish together in our lives, we enjoy vibrant spiritual health.
   Who else exemplified godly fear? How did they express
this fear?
Gen. 42:18
Job 1:1,8
Matt. 26:6-13
Acts 9:31
Rev. 15:1-4
   "The opposition which you meet may prove an advantage
to you in many respects. It will develop a class of Christian
virtues which seldom spring up in the path of prosperity and
sunshine. . . . If you fear God, you need not fear anything
beside. If you please Him, you will secure everything your
soul requires."—This Day With God, p. 47.
  Identify from the following texts people who did not fear
the Lord. What kind of spiritual experience did they have?
Ex. 5:2; 9:27-30; 1 Kings 19:1, 2; 21:20-24; Luke 18:1-6; 23:39, 40;
Acts 5:1-10; 12:21-23.

    What can you say about the relationship between godly
 fear, a healthy spiritual experience, and obedience?


                                                                 31

FURTHER STUDY: Read Joshua 4:23, 24;1 Samuel 12:24; Psalm
2:11; Proverbs 2:1-5; 2 Corinthians 5:10, 11; 1 Peter 1:13-16.
   Also read Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 74.
 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS: Write down your thoughts about
 the following quotation: "'Wherefore, my beloved, . . . work
 out your own salvation with fear and trembling' (Phil. 2:12).
 Well, then, you say, am Ito go around fearing and trembling
 all the way? Yes, in one sense, but not in another sense. You
 have the fear of God before you, and you will have a trem-
 bling lest you will depart from the counsels of God. There
 will be that trembling. You will be working out your own
 salvation all the time with fear and trembling. Does it rest
 here? No, let us hear how the divine power comes in: 'For it
 is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his
 good pleasure' (verse 13)."—This Day With God, p. 344.
TRUE OR FALSE:
      The fear of God is only for inexperienced Christians.
      To fear God, in the biblical sense, means to live in per-
      petual dread of damnation.
      To fear God means to love, revere, and obey Him.
      The fear of God will be outgrown by every saved per-
      son.
      The call to fear God is Heaven's way of forcing us to
      obey His will.
      The chief incentive to fearing God is dread of His judg-
      ment and wrath.
      The chief incentive to fearing God is the realization of
      His infinite love and care for us.
      The Scriptures associate the fear of God with having
      strong confidence in Him.
SUMMARY: The fear of God (love, reverence, and respect for
Him) is one of the Bible's major teachings. The fear of God
teaches us to love and trust God. It teaches us never to allow
any influence or authority to come between us and the Sav-
iour. The fear of God is inspired by a sense of His infinite
greatness, holiness, and self-sacrificing love. It helps us to
receive the gospel. It puts us on guard against Satan and arms
us against every delusion and false doctrine. It keeps the heart
attuned to holy influences and gives vigor and steadiness of
step as we march toward Zion.

                  The Epsom Connection
                         Don McFarlane

   A telephone call interrupted my work one afternoon. The
caller identified himself as a lorry (taxi) driver from Epsom, a
town of 70,000 on the edge of London. "I read a lot of
Christian literature because I am trying to find the true church,"
he explained, outlining his disappointment with churches he
had visited. "As a result of my reading, I have come to the
conclusion that Saturday, not Sunday, is the Bible Sabbath."
   Now such a statement is good news, especially in the British
Isles, where fewer than one in 3,200 people is an Adventist,
and where secularism has a strong hold. So great has been the
decline of Christianity in Britain that many once-fine churches
have been converted into warehouses, shops, or community
centers.
    So in a predominantly secular society, a telephone call from
someone telling us he's convinced that Saturday is the Sabbath
is not treated lightly!
    The caller wanted literature on the Sabbath to present to a
house group with whom he was fellowshiping and studying the
Bible each week. We were happy to comply with his wishes.
    Several weeks later the lorry driver and a friend visited one of
our churches. He was thrilled with the Sabbath services, and he
invited the pastor to meet with his house group. The pastor has
met with the group regularly since then, and is gradually unfold-
ing to them the biblical foundation on which the Seventh-day
Adventist Church stands.
    With no Adventist church in Epsom, our prayer is that this
 house group will form the nucleus of a new congregation. The
 pastor sees signs of the Holy Spirit's working in the lives of
 members of the group.
    Despite antipathy to religion within British society, there are
 thousands who are searching for the hope that the Advent
 message brings. We invite you to join us in praying for the
 work in Epsom and in the British Isles. Let us also ask God to
 prepare us to share truths with others, whenever the call comes.

Britain.

            The Hour of His
              Judgment




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Rev. 14:7; Ps. 48:9-11;
96:11-13; Isa. 16:5; Dan. 7:9, 10, 13, 14; 2 Cor. 5:10.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Vindicate me in your righteousness, 0
     Lord my God" (Psalm 35:24, NIV).

  KEY THOUGHT: God's pre-Advent judgment vindicates
His truth, His people, and His dealings with both believers
and unbelievers.

   OCTOBER 23, 1844. Crops lay rotting in the fields. Why
harvest them when Christ was returning October 22? But He
had not returned. Hiram Edson had believed with all his heart
that Christ would return October 22. In order to cope with the
discouragement, he and several others met to pray. After the
meeting, when he was on his way to encourage other Adventists,
he received a vital insight. Instead of Christ leaving the heav-
enly sanctuary to come to this earth at the end of the 2300 days,
He actually began a work in the second apartment of the sanc-
tuary that must be done before He comes again.
   Edson and other Adventists became convinced that the key
to understanding what happened on October 22, 1844, is a
correct understanding of the prophecies of Daniel and Revela-
tion in relation to the earthly-sanctuary services of the ancient
Israelites. This week, coinciding with October 22, 1994, we will
study the judgment-hour message of the first angel—the mes-
sage that ushered in a new era for Adventists, the message that
Seventh-day Adventists are to proclaim to a dying world.

A VISUAL AID FOR SLAVES (Ex. 25:8).
   As slaves in Egypt, the majority of Israelites were ignorant
regarding God's plan of salvation. Thus, when He freed them,
He found it necessary to construct a visual aid (the earthly
sanctuary) that would teach them about this plan. He gave the
blueprint to Moses at the same time He gave him the Ten
Commandments. (See Exodus 25-30.) Everything about this
visual aid taught the Israelites something about God and Christ.
   The sanctuary consisted of the courtyard, the Holy Place,
and the Most Holy Place. Leviticus 1-7 and 16 describe the
services to be conducted in these areas.
  What was one of the most important daily sanctuary cer-
emonies? What did the lamb and the sacrifice symbolize?
Lev. 4:27-35; John 1:29; Rev. 5:1-9; 7:14.

   In the cases of sin-offerings for the priest or for the entire
congregation, the officiating priest sprinkled some of the blood
before the veil in the holy place (Lev. 4:6, 17). In the cases of
sin-offerings for a ruler or an ordinary person, the blood was
sprinkled on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and the
officiating priest ate a portion of the animal's flesh (Lev. 4:25,
30; 6:24-30). In all cases the work of the officiating priest sym-
bolized the forgiveness and cleansing of the sinner and the
retention of the record of the pardoned sin in the sanctuary.
   Through the daily sacrifices, the sinner admitted the author-
ity of the law, confessed guilt, and displayed faith in the Mes-
siah who would take away sins. But while the blood freed the
sinner from condemnation, in type, the record of forgiven sin
remained. The sins of Israel, thus transferred to the sanctuary,
defiled the holy places. The annual Day of Atonement cleansed
the holy places from the record of pardoned sin and provided
spiritual cleansing for the people. (See Lev. 16:16, 19, 30, 33.)
  How does Leviticus 16:7-10, 15-22, describe the Day of
Atonement, also known as the cleansing of the sanctuary?

   The Day of Atonement cleansing of the sanctuary symbol-
ized the pre-Advent judgment Daniel saw in vision (Dan. 7:9-
14; 8:14), the judgment announced by the first angel of Revela-
tion 14. The remainder of this week's lesson teaches us about
the Day of Atonement and the event it typified.

                                                                35

CLEANSING TIME (Lev. 16:16, 19, 30, 33).

   Cleansing the sanctuary required two goats:
   1. The Lord's goat. The high priest sprinkled the blood of the
Lord's goat on the mercy seat, the cover of the ark containing
the Ten Commandments. This action represented the applica-
tion in the heavenly judgment of the merits of the Messiah's
sacrifice for sin. His blood enabled us to be reconciled to Him
and to His Father (John 3:16; 1 John 1:7). Next the high priest
sprinkled the blood on the altar of incense and the altar of
burnt offering. Every day of the year the altar of burnt offering
had been defiled with the blood that represented confessed
sins. Thus atonement or cleansing was made for the entire
sanctuary and the people. (See Lev. 16:33, 34.)
   2. The scapegoat. A careful study of Leviticus 16 in relation to
the rest of Scripture tells us that this goat represents Satan: (a)
Because the scapegoat was not slain as a sacrifice, it could not
be a means of bringing forgiveness (Heb. 9:22). (b) The sanctu-
ary was cleansed by the blood of the Lord's goat before the
scapegoat became a part of the actual ritual (Lev. 16:20). (c)
Leviticus 16 treats the scapegoat as a personal being, God's
opponent. The Lord's goat represents Christ, and the scape-
goat represents Satan.—Adapted from Frank Holbrook, "Sanc-
tuary of Salvation," Ministry, January 1983, p. 14. The actions
of the high priest regarding the scapegoat symbolized the plac-
ing of the responsibility for all sin where it rightfully belongs—
on Satan.

   While the high priest was officiating, what were the people
to do? Lev. 16:29-31.


   Afflict your souls. This included "soul searching, a review
of one's progress in holy living, a seeking of God, confession of
sin, making amends for neglected duties, [and] squaring ac-
counts with God and men."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1,
pp. 778, 779.
   The Day of Atonement symbolized a day of judgment when
Christ comes to the aid of His people. His judgment harmo-
nizes with His faithfulness. Thus He champions the cause of
His people, guides them, and protects them. His judgment is
motivated by love, grace, mercy, and His desire to reconcile
sinners with God and Himself. The outcome of His judgment,
therefore, is salvation. (See Deut. 32:36; Isa. 30:18; Ps. 25:6-9;
103:6-22.)

HEAVEN'S COURT CONVENES (Dan. 7:9,10; 8:14).

   What was the significance of the earthly sanctuary? Ex.
25:9; Heb. 8:1-6; 9:23; Rev. 11:19. What did Daniel witness in
vision? Dan. 7:9, 10, 13, 14; 8:14 (compare Dan. 12:1; Rev. 3:5;
19:7, 8).

   There are many interesting linguistic connections that exist
between Daniel 8:14 and Leviticus 16. Following are two ex-
amples: (1) The Hebrew word for "sanctuary" in Daniel 8:14 is
the same as the word used in Leviticus 16 to specify the sanctu-
ary as the object of cleansing. The sanctuary mentioned in
Daniel 8:14 refers to the heavenly sanctuary because the vision
reaches to "the time of the end" (Dan. 8:17). The earthly sanc-
tuary ceased to have significance at the cross. (See Hebrews 8.)
(2) In Daniel 8:14, the Hebrew word translated as "cleansed" is
nitsdaq. It comes from the word tsadaq, which means "to justify,
to be or make righteous, pure, or clean." In Leviticus 16:30 the
verb "to cleanse" translates taher. In the Old Testament tsadaq
and taher are used synonymously. For example, Job 4:17, "Can
a mortal be more righteous [tsadaq] than God? Or can a man
be more pure [taher]?" Thus, the idea of "cleansing" can be
attributed to the word nitsdaq. This is why the Septuagint (the
Greek OT) translates the Hebrew of Daniel 8:14: "and the sanc-
tuary shall be cleansed." As both the sanctuary and the people
were cleansed (or justified, put right) on the Day of Atone-
ment, so they will be in the antitypical Day of Atonement
referred to in Daniel 8:14.
    Because the Hebrew verb tsadaq also means to justify, in the
sense of restore, Daniel 8:14 may also refer to the restoration of
the sanctuary truth in the last days.
    Daniel 7 and 8 describe the heavenly sanctuary's day of
atonement. "And as during the typical Day of Atonement the
cleansing of the earthly sanctuary removed the sins accumu-
lated there, so the heavenly sanctuary is cleansed by the final
removal of the record of sins in the heavenly books. But before
the records are finally cleared, they will be examined to deter-
mine who through repentance and faith in Christ is entitled to
enter His eternal kingdom. The cleansing of the heavenly sanc-
 tuary, therefore, involves a work of investigation or judgment
 that fully reflects the nature of the Day of Atonement as a day
 of judgment."—Seventh-day Adventists Believe, p. 320.
   How can we be sure that our names will be cleared in the
 judgment? 1 John 1:9; 4:16-18; Rev. 3:5.

THE HOUR OF HIS JUDGMENT (Rev. 14:7).
   What does the first angel's message tell us about the time
of the judgment? What light do Daniel 8:9-14 and 9:22-27
shed upon this time?

    These verses in Daniel tell us when the "hour" of His judg-
ment arrives. Daniel 8:14 calls the pre-Advent judgment of
Daniel 7:9-14 the cleansing of the sanctuary. The cleansing of
the sanctuary was to begin after 2300 days. The Hebrew phrase
translated "days" means "evening-morning." It refers to a twenty-
four-hour period. (Compare Gen. 1:5, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31; Ex. 27:20,
21.) The reference in Daniel 8:14 is not to the morning and
evening sacrifices of the sanctuary, but to 2300 twenty-four-
hour days, which are used as a prophetic symbol.
    The 2300 literal days of Daniel 8:14 are symbolic of 2300
years. The prophet was told that the work of the little horn
would continue till the end of time (Dan 8:17, 19, 25, 26).
Twenty-three hundred literal days would not reach to the end
of time. The "days" are intended to be symbolic of years.
    The vision of Daniel 9 was given in 538 B.C., 13 years after
the vision of Daniel 8 (551 B.C.). Gabriel told Daniel that "sev-
enty weeks" (Hebrew: "seventy sevens") were to be "cut off"
(Hebrew) from the 2300 days. These "seventy sevens" must
refer to 490 years, because they were to reach to the time of the
Messiah (Christ). The 490 years were to be cut off from the
beginning of the 2300 days. You cannot have 490 years cut off
from 2300 literal days. The 2300 days are a prophetic symbol of
2300 years.
    The beginning date of the 490 years and the 2300 years is
given in Daniel 9:25: "the going forth of the commandment to
restore and to build Jerusalem." Ezra 6:14 indicates that God's
command for the complete restoration of Jerusalem was put
into effect by the decrees of three Persian monarchs: Cyrus'
decree (537 B.C.); Darius I's decree (519 or 518 B.C.); Artaxerxes
I's decree (457 B.C.).
    Counting 2300 years from 457 B.C. brings us to 1844. Since
the decree of Artaxerxes was put into effect in the autumn of
457 B.C., the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary, the pre-
Advent judgment, began in the autumn of 1844.

THE STANDARD OF JUDGMENT (James 2:8-12; Eccl. 12:13,
14).
  Valid judgment does not proceed along arbitrary lines. God
has no secret teachings, no secret requirements, or unattain-
able demands. Through the proclamation of His judgment He
makes plain what He expects of us and what provisions He has
made for us to meet His requirements.
  What is the standard—the measure of character and con-
duct—in the judgment? James 2:8-12; Eccl. 12:13, 14.

  "While Christ is cleansing the sanctuary, the worshipers on
earth should carefully review their life, and compare their
character with the standard of righteousness."—Evangelism, p.
224. (See 2 Cor. 13:5; Ps. 119:27-32.)
   In practical life, how do we exhibit obedience to God's
law? Micah 6:8; Matt. 7:12; 25:32-46.

   The three angels' messages are a call for the whole world to
obey God's law through faith in Jesus. God urges us to sound
this call so that people everywhere might enter into fellowship
with Christ and be freed from sin. The proclamation of the
judgment comes as a warning appeal to all who are caught in
Satan's deceptions.
   But God's judgment is not one last scare tactic to compel
submission. It is an examination, a type of spiritual audit and
exposition of what the saving power of Jesus has done in and
for His believers. It also explains His dealings with sin. In this
sense the judgment is heaven's ordained means of removing
all doubts about God's government, how He deals with evil,
and the effectiveness of His plan of salvation (Rom. 3:3, 4; Isa.
5:3, 4). The outcome is complete vindication of God's charac-
ter. Not only does the universe conclude from the disclosures
made in the judgment that God is free of all blame, but also
that He is worthy of the highest praise and most fervent loy-
alty.
    How can we follow the work of Christ's judgment today
 with interest, confidence, and an appropriate sense of secu-
 rity and assurance? Hosea 2:19, 20; Ps. 29:9-11.


                                                               39

FURTHER STUDY: Each of the following provides an in-depth
look at the investigative judgment: The Great Controversy, chap-
ters 18-24, 28; Seventh-day Adventists Believe . . ., chapters 12, 23;
Patriarchs and Prophets, chapter 30. For an in-depth study on
the connections between Leviticus 16 and Daniel 8, see Sympo-
sium on Daniel, Daniel & Revelation Committee Series, vol. 2
(Silver Spring, Md.: Biblical Research Institute, General Con-
ference of Seventh-day Adventists, 1986), pp. 426-461; 527-549.
 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How would you explain the beauties of the sanctuary
     truth to a neighbor who asks, "Don't you live in fear of
     your name coming up in this investigative judgment
     you believe in?"
     2. What significance is there in the fact that the work of
        judgment is done in a sanctuary? (What does the word
        sanctuary mean?) As you think about your answer, con-
        sider Exodus 25:8; Psalm 43:1-4; 63:2-5.
   Tomorrow will be the 150th anniversary of the beginning of
Christ's judgment in the Most Holy Place. As we allow the
Lord to prepare our hearts for the Sabbath, let us remember
that we do so to qualify as harbingers of the judgment-hour
message. The first angel's message is our message. And it is a
message of God's love and mercy—a love and mercy that
provide both freedom from guilt and victory over sin.
   "In the judgment the tables are turned. No longer do we
stand accused as a defendant, for Christ has paid the full price
for our acquittal. Now we become the plaintiff, calling for
vindication against the false charges of Satan. Now with David
we can long for and welcome the judgment. We can pray,
'Judge [vindicate, RSV] me, 0 Lord my God, according to thy
righteousness' (Ps. 35:24)."—Richard M. Davidson, "Assurance
in the Judgment," Adventist Review, Jan. 7, 1988, p. 18.
SUMMARY: The proclamation of the first angel concerning
the hour of God's judgment summons all persons to recognize
their individual moral accountability to God. This judgment
results in the vindication of God, His truth, and His people. All
false charges brought against His character, government, law,
and followers are refuted in the judgment. And His right to
save His people and to rule the universe are forever estab-
lished beyond all doubt.

                  The Gospel on the Beach
                          Alejandro Bull&

    If public beaches can be used for rock-music festivals and vol-
leyball tournaments, why can't they be transformed into arenas to
preach the gospel? The Espiritu Santo Conference in Brazil asked
this question as they sought a novel approach to evangelizing
unchurched people in East Brazil. Only two Adventist families live
in Camburi, the affluent area we were targeting for evangelism.
    Each year the church sponsors a Harvesting Week revival series.
We could expect about 8,000 people to attend the five-thy event,
usually held in a sports gymnasium.
    We decided to hold the Harvesting Week revival program on the
beach. For the evangelistic series to be workable, it was necessary
to set up metal stadium-style benches and a stage with special
lighting and a sound system powerful enough to reach one kilome-
ter (2/3 mile). Advertising for the meetings was coordinated by
Novo Tiempo, the Adventist-owned radio station in the area.
    Early in the afternoon, crowds that eventually numbered up to
15,000 began arriving to get seats in the outdoor auditorium. Traf-
fic was disrupted as cars and busses poured toward the beach. In
addition, many families were listening to the gospel from the win-
dows of their luxury apartments nearby and via 11 radio stations
that had arranged to carry the live broadcasts to the states of Espiritu
Santo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, and southern Bahia, Brazil).
    The results were extraordinary. One couple who were arguing
heatedly in their apartment, heard the program through their win-
dow. They were so moved by the Holy Spirit that when the call was
made to accept Jesus, they responded, leaving their apartment and
 crossing the street to reach the stage on the beach!
    Among the hundreds who answered the call to unite themselves
 with the SDA Church were 53 persons who live in the exclusive
 Camburi district, where before the meetings only two Adventist
 families lived. These precious souls are studying and preparing for
 baptism.
    About half the people who attended the meetings were non-
 Adventist friends, relatives, neighbors, or colleagues of our church
 members with whom they had shared the message. This confirms
 that public evangelism is much more productive when it accompa-
 nies individual efforts of church members.

South American Division.

          Give Glory to Him




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Rev. 14:7; 5:11-14; Ps.
96:6-8; John 17:5, 20-24.
     MEMORY TEXT: "For ye are bought with a price: there-
     fore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which
     are God's" (1 Corinthians 6:20).
  KEY THOUGHT: God's glory is revealed in His character.
When we unite with God through Jesus we become like Him in
character, and thus glorify Him.
    TRUE GREATNESS. Mourners packed the cathedral for
the funeral of Louis XIV of France, whom they considered to
be a great ruler. All was dark except for one candle illuminat-
ing the king's body, put there to symbolize his greatness. When
the court minister rose to speak, he snuffed out the candle.
Then from the darkness the minister spoke just four words,
"God only is great!"
    The first angel's call to give glory to God reminds us that we
are to honor and exalt Him only. Christ's willing death for our
salvation is the summit of all glory. As we ourselves are satu-
rated with His pardoning love, we will glorify Him. How?
Read Colossians 1:27.
    Christ dwelling in us results in an outpouring of heavenly
love—a love that exhibits kindness, purity of life, and truth.
Such love attracts others, enabling us to share Christ with
them. This witness is the supreme way to glorify God. Surely,
it is this witness that the first angel urges us to give.

THE ESSENCE OF HIS GLORY (Ex. 34:5-7).
  The Hebrew word most commonly translated "glory" in the
King James Version means "weightiness, splendor, majesty,
abundance, riches, and honor." The New Testament Greek
word for "glory" signifies "splendor, magnificence, fame, re-
nown, honor." God's glory relates to His holy, righteous char-
acter and the praise and honor He deserves because of His
character.
   Moses longed for the deepest possible fellowship with the
Lord (Ex. 33:13, 14) and for this purpose asked a special bless-
ing of Him. What was his request? How did God reply? Ex.
33:18-23.

   In revealing His glory to Moses, what did the Lord pro-
claim? How do His words explain what Moses saw? Ex. 34:5-
7.

   "The unveiled glory of God no man could look upon and
live; but Moses is assured that he shall behold as much of the
divine glory as he can bear in his present, mortal state. That
Hand that made the world, that holds the mountains in their
places, takes this man of dust—this man of mighty faith—and
mercifully covers him in a cleft of the rock, while the glory of
God and all His goodness pass before him. . . .
   "No earthly power or skill or learning can supply the place
of God's immediate presence. In the history of Moses we may
see what intimate communion with God it is man's privilege to
enjoy."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 533.
   The glory that passed before Moses was accompanied by
God's declaration of His own characteristics—holiness, mercy,
justice, and love. This declaration is most important, because
Satan attributes to God his own vile characteristics. Thus, many
people mistakenly believe that God is either a pampering, in-
dulgent benefactor, or a stern, unfeeling judge. God is our
benefactor and judge. But He exercises this dual power as such
with perfect righteousness and redemptive wisdom, rather than
with permissiveness or despotism. We are to glorify Him for
His perfect goodness, longsuffering mercy, and pure justice.
   What lessons on glorifying God can we learn from Moses'
 encounter with Him on Sinai?

                                                              43
Monday                                            October 24
THE HOPE OF GLORY (Eph. 3:14-21).
   The crowning act of God's Creation is persons made in His
own image (Gen. 1:26, 27; Ps. 8:4-9). He not only created us for
His glory (Isa. 43:7; Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 264) but He ransomed
us from sin by the blood of His only Son (Col. 1:12, 13). More
than this, through His atoning grace, God provided for us to
enter into an even closer relationship with Him than if we had
never sinned (Heb. 2:6-11; Rev. 1:6).
   What extraordinary benefit is included in the gospel? Does
this benefit make those who receive it praiseworthy? Col.
1:27; Eph. 3:14-21.

   The benefit of having Christ as our indwelling Lord and
Saviour is beyond all wealth. What could we ever do to earn or
deserve such fellowship? Let us not decline the honor that the
King of the universe offers to us. He paid the highest price to
ransom us from the power of the enemy. Therefore, we should
not treat carelessly His offer to live in our hearts (Rev. 3:20).
   "Our minds need expansion, that we may comprehend the
significance of the provision of God. We are to reflect the
highest attributes of the character of God."—That I May Know
Him, p. 302.
  On the evening before His crucifixion, for what did Christ
pray on behalf of His followers? How were they to glorify
Him? John 17:9-11, 17-24, 26.

   Oneness with God is the essential means by which we may
glorify Him. This union comes solely by the gospel of Jesus
Christ. Because we are sinful by nature, only His ministry on
our behalf can awaken in us the desire to have Him live in our
hearts (Rom. 8:7; 3:10-12; Isa. 53:3-7). It is to His glory that God
is willing and able to reclaim His enemies from a state of
resistance to one of love and loyalty to Him (Rom. 5:6-11, 17-
19). Any glory we bring to God derives its splendor from this
gospel transaction.
   What attracts you to Jesus Christ? Have you welcomed
 Him into your heart? Think of some ways His character
 could shine through you more brightly.

GLORIFYING GOD BY OUR LIVES (Gal. 5:22, 23).

  Christ's entire life on earth was an exhibit of redeeming
love. He came to save and elevate humanity. Through His
dwelling in us, we become His hands, eyes, lips, and feet, filled
with His love and abilities. Godly living means more than just
morally blameless conduct. It means a life of unselfish, anointed
service to humanity. (See James 1:27; Isa. 58:6-11.) Anything
short of this experience is sterile and self-centered.

 How did Jesus say His followers bring glory to God?
Matt. 5:16; John 15:8, 16, 17.


   Note that bearing fruit to God's glory is twofold:
   1. Christ's followers bring forth the fruit of the Spirit in their
lives, thereby manifesting the character of Christ (Gal. 5:22, 23;
Phil. 1:11).
   "To give glory to God is to reveal His character in our own,
and thus to make Him known. And in whatever way we make
known the Father or the Son, we glorify God."—Ellen G. White
Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 979.
   2. Christ's followers also, in partnership with Him, bring
forth the fruit of new converts to the kingdom of heaven (John
4:35-39; Rom. 1:13; Ps. 126:5, 6).
   "Christ is seeking to reproduce Himself in the hearts of men;
and He does this through those who believe in Him. The object
of the Christian life is fruit bearing—the reproduction of
Christ's character in the believer, that it may be reproduced in
others."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 67.
   "The completeness of Christian character is attained when
the impulse to help and bless others springs constantly from
within—when the sunshine of heaven fills the heart and is
revealed in the countenance."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 384.

   How else may we glorify God? Ps. 50:23; Rom. 4:20-22;
15:5-7; 1 Cor. 10:31.


   What influence does our union with Christ have upon
 our witness for Him? Why is it such a vital part of His will
 for us to be involved in the salvation of others?
    Is it a joy or a burden to live for God's glory? Why?



                                                                  45

GLORY NOT IN SELF (Jer. 9:23, 24).

   The first angel's message interrupts a world preoccupied
with self-glorification. Often the clothes we wear, the cars we
drive, and the careers we pursue are for self-exaltation and
self-gratification. The apostle Paul foretold that in the latter
days people would "be lovers of their own selves, covetous,
boasters, proud, . . . lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
God" (2 Tim. 3:2-4). This is not only distasteful, it is debasing,
destructive, and directly opposed to the reason God created
and redeemed us (2 Thess. 1:11, 12; 1 Peter 5:10, 11).

   In what are we to glory, and in what are we not to glory?
Jer. 9:23, 24; Ps. 115:1.


  Is it acceptable to take satisfaction in the abilities and
successes God gives us? At what point may our satisfaction
become inappropriate or excessive?


   In theory it is perhaps quite easy for us to admit that we
have no business seeking our own glory (Prov. 25:27). Yet we
are all tempted to clamor for credit and recognition when we
do something "good." Then the sobering counsel comes back
to us, "Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or con-
ceit, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than
himself" (Phil. 2:3, NKJV). What a different world (what a
different church!) it would be if we really took this advice to
heart.

  We discover in the Word of God that we ourselves cannot
erase human pride and perversity (Rom. 7:17-24). How only
can this be done? Rom. 3:20-28; Eph. 2:8-10 (see also The
Desire of Ages, p. 493).


   "What is justification by faith? It is the work of God in
laying the glory of man in the dust, and doing for man that
which it is not in his power to do for himself."—Testimonies to
Ministers, p. 456.
   Does the gospel of Jesus Christ banish self-respect? Or
does it establish it on a proper basis? Explain your point of
view.

Thursday                                       October 27
HIS GLORY PROCLAIMED (Isa. 60:1-5).

   God's greatest desire is that all should accept His salvation.
Even though most people refuse this gift, His zeal in striving to
save them from sin is undiminished. He has decreed that while
spiritual probation remains open He will brighten the earth
with His glory in order to prepare every willing soul for the
second coming of Jesus (Rev. 18:1). He enlists His church to
join with Him in this global mission.

   What awakening call does Heaven issue to the church in
the closing days of earth's history? What are the results of
this call? Isa. 60:1-5.


   "It is the darkness of misapprehension of God that is en-
shrouding the world. Men are losing their knowledge of His
character. It has been misunderstood and misinterpreted. At
this time a message from God is to be proclaimed, a message
illuminating in its influence and saving in its power. His char-
acter is to be made known. Into the darkness of the world is to
be shed the light of His glory, the light of His goodness, mercy,
and truth."
    "It is the privilege of every soul to be a living channel
through which God can communicate to the world the treas-
ures of His grace, the unsearchable riches of Christ. There is
nothing that Christ desires so much as agents who will repre-
sent to the world His Spirit and character. There is nothing that
the world needs so much as the manifestation through human-
ity of the Saviour's love. All heaven is waiting for channels
through which can be poured the holy oil to be a joy and
blessing to human hearts.
    "Christ has made every provision that His church shall be a
transformed body, illumined with the Light of the world, pos-
sessing the glory of Emmanuel. . . . The indwelling of the Spirit
will be shown by the outflowing of heavenly love."—Christ's
Object Lessons, pp. 415, 419. (Read the whole chapter "To Meet
the Bridegroom," pp. 405-421.)
    Have you heard in your heart the Lord's call to arise and
 shine as a witness for Him? Can you think of any habits,
 obstacles, or sins in your life that are hindering you from
 answering His call? Remember that His Spirit is present to
 give you eternal victory through Jesus Christ. Claim that
 victory today, with repentance, joy, and thanksgiving.

This is the glory of God, which closes the work of the third
angel."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 19.
 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What connection exists between fearing God and giving
     glory to Him?
     2. By what means can you resist the temptation to take
        credit or glorify yourself when God works through your
        life to bless others?
     3. After communing on Mount Sinai with the Lord, Moses'
        face glowed with divine glory (Ex. 34:29). What relation-
        ship does this bear to the kind of experience God wants
        us to have as we commune with Him? (See 2 Cor. 3:7-18
        in connection with "The Righteousness of Christ in the
        Law" in Selected Messages, book 1, pp. 236-241.)
     4. What relationship is there between the "everlasting gos-
        pel" (Rev. 14:6) and the injunction to "Fear God, and
        give glory to him" (verse 7)? Are they the same thing, or
        are there differences? Explain your answer.
SUMMARY: The first angel's call to glorify God beckons us to
open our hearts to God's presence. Thus we are enabled to
appreciate His truth and to partake of His divine nature. Christ's
redeeming love becomes the inspiration of our faith, the im-
pulse of our praise, and the incentive of our service. Paul epito-
mizes such a life with this testimony, "For to me to live is
Christ" (Phil. 1:21).

Elena! Mission
                       Give Me a Hard Place to Work
                               James H. Zachary

             The evangelism team had just arrived in Ghana. As we
         entered the crowded motel, we thanked God for the air
         conditioner that helped to relieve the tropical heat. Suddenly
         the electricity failed and the water stopped flowing. The tiny
         motel rooms became sweat boxes. One volunteer, a wealthy
         woman, lamented, "Why did I ever come?"
             The team faced a big challenge: The target community was
         mostly Muslim, where evangelism was difficult and discourag-
         ing. Earnestly the team prayed for the Lord's help. But even
         before they could pray, the Lord was answering their prayers.
             A Muslim man in the city faced great problems in his
         business and his family. Five times a day he spread out his
         prayer mat and asked Allah for help, but he received no
         answers. Then one night he dreamed he saw Jesus kindly,
         lovingly beckoning him to come.
             As he awakened he thought, if Jesus is so kind, why not ask
         Him for help? So he prayed. And his prayers were being
         answered. What joy!
             Another night the man dreamed he watched a parade.
         Marchers held placards that discouraged smoking and drink-
         ing, and a sign that advertised a Health Expo evangelistic
         meeting. In his dream someone handed him a handbill.
             Two days later he watched as a parade passed his business.
         He recognized it as the parade that he had seen in his dream! A
          person handed him a piece of paper—the same handbill he had
         seen in his dream! He decided Allah surely must want him at
         this meeting!
             He attended the meetings regularly. When the evangelist
          gave the invitation to follow Jesus, this Muslim man was the
          first to stand. Others followed his example. This experience
          brought encouragement to the evangelistic team, especially the
          wealthy woman. She exclaimed, "I want to come back again!
          And please send me to a hard place!"
                                  God would like to use each member of
                               the world church as a witness to those
                               searching for His help. As we submit our
                               lives to His guidance, God will use us to
                               help win others to Himself.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his
     name; worship the Lord in the splendor of his holiness"
     (Psalm 29:2, NIV).
   KEY THOUGHT: Life's meaning is found and expressed in
true worship of our Creator. The first angel's call to worship
"him who made" all things is intended to bring us back to
perfect fellowship with our Creator.
   "WHAT'S THE NEWS?" One of those who experienced the
1844 disappointment was Sea Captain Joseph Bates. But in-
stead of losing faith, he applied himself to further study and
prayer. In the year 1845, he read an article concerning the
seventh-day Sabbath. After investigating the biblical evidence
this article presented, he accepted the Sabbath as truth. One
day on a bridge between two cities, he met his neighbor and
fellow Adventist. When the neighbor asked, "What's the news,
Captain Bates?" Bates replied, "The news is that the seventh
day is the Sabbath."
   The news of the seventh-day Sabbath is integral to the first
angel's admonition to worship the Creator. God gave us the
Sabbath to remind us of His creatorship and to give us sacred,
periodic time for undistracted communion with Him. We wor-
ship God exclusively, because we owe our existence to Him.
   God's Sabbath sets us apart from the world. It is this sepa-
rateness that leads us to be more fully made in His image.

WORSHIPING IN SPIRIT AND TRUTH (Isa. 63:7; Rev. 7:11,
12).

   What reply did Jesus give to the Samaritan woman's ques-
tion about the correct way to worship God? John 4:20-26.

   Jesus told the woman that the authentic knowledge of God
was committed to the Jews so they could convey the truth to
the world. He revealed that acceptable worship is performed
in spirit and in truth. To worship Him in spirit is to worship
Him with the whole heart and soul, filled with God's love
through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. To worship Him in
truth is to have our minds guided, sanctified, and energized by
the Word of God.
   How does true worship affect our character and conduct?
Ps. 119:73, 74; James 1:18, 22.

   "The religion that comes from God is the only religion that
will lead to God. In order to serve Him aright, we must be born
of the divine Spirit. . . . It will purify the heart and renew the
mind, and give us a new capacity for knowing and loving God.
It will give us willing obedience to all His requirements. This is
true worship."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 156.

   What attitudes should characterize our worship of God?
2 Chron. 7:3; Rev. 7:11, 12; Isa 63:7.

   The word for worship in Revelation 14:7 and in many other
texts means "to prostrate oneself in reverent adoration." "Un-
less correct ideas of true worship and true reverence are im-
pressed upon the people, there will be a growing tendency to
place the sacred and eternal on a level with common things,
and those professing the truth will be an offense to God and a
disgrace to religion."—My Life Today, p. 285.

   How can worship be joyful and serious at the same time?
 What is it about God that arouses your most worshipful
 thoughts and feelings? How can your worship life be richer?
   Do you think any of the following may place the sacred
 and eternal on a level with common things? If so, how? (a)
 popular gospel music; (b) fixing a neighbor's sink on Sab-
 bath; (c) talking during the worship service.

                                                               51

WORSHIPING GOD IN THE SANCTUARY (Ps. 63:1-5).

  Where did the ancient Israelites worship? Ex. 25:8; Ps.
134:1-3.


   God did not mean for the sanctuary to become the object of
worship, as it was in the days of Judah's apostasy (Jer. 7:1-4).
Instead, it was to be the center of religious education for the
great teachings of the gospel (Hebrews 8-10.) Israel's sanctu-
ary and temple were copies of the heavenly sanctuary, from
which Jesus, since His return to heaven, ministers all the ben-
efits of His atonement (Heb. 4:14-16; 8:1, 2; 9:11, 12, 22). Ac-
cordingly, we direct our worship to Christ and the Father in
the heavenly sanctuary. The book of Revelation unveils the
sanctuary to our spiritual view, giving us worship-inspiring
glimpses of Christ's ministration in the Holy of Holies on our
behalf. (See Rev. 1:10-20; chap. 4, 5; 11:19; 15:5-8.)

   Describe two vital ways to worship. Luke 9:18 (compare
Matt. 14:23); Luke 4:16 (compare Luke 24:52, 53).

   For the soul to flourish, it needs a balanced life. Public
worship is as important as private devotion and prayer (Matt.
6:6; Ps. 84:1-4; 1 John 1:7; Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing,
pp. 84-86, the comment on Matt. 6:5). Neither function can take
the place of the other, but they enhance each other. God has
provided Sabbath services, prayer meetings, camp meetings,
and other gatherings to help us to grow spiritually through
corporate worship. We cannot safely neglect these opportuni-
ties for group worship.
   "To the humble, believing soul, the house of God on earth is
the gate of heaven. The song of praise, the prayer, the words
spoken by Christ's representatives, are God's appointed agen-
cies to prepare a people for the church above, for that loftier
worship into which there can enter nothing that defileth. . . .
   "The house is the sanctuary for the family, and the closet or
the grove the most retired place for individual worship; but
the church is the sanctuary for the congregation."—Testimo-
nies, vol. 5, p. 491.

   How can you help make public worship meetings more
valuable to yourself and others? How vital a bearing does
your private devotional life have on the blessings you re-
ceive and share in corporate worship?

IMPLICATIONS OF HIS CREATORSHIP (Ps. 96:4, 5).

   What distinguishes the true God from all false gods? Ps.
96:4, 5; 1 Cor. 8:4-6.

   The fundamental reason for worshiping God is that He is
our Creator. He made us in His own image (Gen. 1:1, 26, 27), a
convincing indication of His sublime purposes for us. "Man
was to bear God's image, both in outward resemblance and in
character. . . . He was holy and happy in bearing the image of
God and in perfect obedience to His will."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
p. 45. God created us, not to be puppets or slaves, but His
friends and children (John 15:14, 15; Rom. 8:15-17; 1 John 3:1).
We were alienated from God by the nature we inherited through
the Fall. Nonetheless, we may become partakers of the divine
nature and receive the "adoption of sons" in Christ.
  How should knowledge of our true origin affect our con-
cept of life? Neh. 9:6; Ps. 95:4-8.

    "There is no ground for the supposition that man was evolved
. . . from the lower forms of . . . life. Such teaching lowers the
great work of the Creator to the level of man's narrow, earthly
conceptions. Men are so intent upon excluding God from the
sovereignty of the universe that they degrade man and defraud
him of the dignity of his origin."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 45.

   What are the results of denying God's Creatorship? Rom.
1:18, 19, 29-32.

   Sinful human beings in their moral derangement strut about
like pagan gods, doing whatever their perverse natures dictate.
Making their own imaginations and depraved wills the final
arbiter of their choices, they have become brutish and self-
centered, like the people of Noah's day (Gen. 6:5-13).
   True worship elevates, ennobles, and refines our characters,
ennabling us to rise above the baser things of life. Worship calls
us to be formed in God's image while always realizing we are
but creatures He deeply loves.

   How does the knowledge that God has created you in
 His own image affect your religious experience?


                                                                53

GROWING INTO THE LIKENESS OF OUR CREATOR
(1 Peter 1:14-25).
   When sinners accept Christ on His terms, what changes
take place in their lives? Rom. 8:29-31; 2 Cor. 5:17, 20, 21; Eph.
2:8-10.

   Only the Creator can cause such a profound and extensive
change. David understood this when He prayed, "Blot out all
mine iniquities. Create in me a clean heart, 0 God; and renew a
right spirit within me" (Ps. 51:9, 10). We cannot by ourselves
generate the spirit of repentance embodied in this prayer. God's
wooing mercies and guidance, along with His convicting ap-
peals and chastening, lead us to repentance (Ps. 119:67, 71;
Rom. 2:4; Rev. 3:20). We have but an incomplete idea of how
ardently and affectionately God labors for our salvation. Let us
faithfully cooperate with Him.
   What are the practical results of being regenerated (re-
created) by Christ? Rom. 12:1, 2; 1 Peter 1:14-25.

    Every species of godly reform comes into the life of a truly
born-again person. The genuinely converted heart now inclines
toward the pure ways of heaven. True, morally sound reform
is in harmony with heaven's laws.
     How does Ecclesiastes 12:13, 14 define our moral duty?

   "Without obedience to His commandments, no worship can
be pleasing to God. 'This is the love of God, that we keep His
commandments.' He that turneth away his ear from hearing
the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.' 1 John 5:3;
Proverbs 28:9. The duty to worship God is based upon the fact
that He is the Creator and that to Him all other beings owe
their existence."—The Great Controversy, p. 436. "God's law is
the transcript of His character."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 305.
(Compare Deut. 10:12, 13.) The call to worship God the Creator
categorically challenges the idolatrous spirit of our age, which
flouts His law as fictitious or obsolete.
  How can you be delivered from the imperfections of
your character that keep you from being like Jesus, your
Creator?

GOD'S MEMORIAL OF CREATION (Ex. 20:8-11).
  God's final warning and appeal centers on the question of
worship, that is, worship of the beast versus worship of the
Creator (Rev. 13:11-15; 14:7).
   Which day alone is the Sabbath of God's Word? Gen. 2:1,
2; Ex. 20:10, 11 (compare Luke 23:52-24:1).

  What express reason has God given for establishing this
day of worship? Ex. 20:8-11; 31:13, 17.

   "God saw that a Sabbath was essential for man, even in
Paradise. He needed to lay aside his own interests and pursuits
for one day of the seven, that he might more fully contemplate
the works of God and meditate upon His power and goodness.
He needed a Sabbath to remind him more vividly of God and
to awaken gratitude because all that he enjoyed and possessed
came from the beneficent hand of the Creator."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, p. 48.
  What connection exists between Sabbathkeeping and re-
demption? Eze. 20:12, 20; Isa. 56:1-8.

   "The Sabbath is a sign of Christ's power to make us holy. . . .
As a sign of His sanctifying power, the Sabbath is given to all
who through Christ become part of the Israel of God. . . . The
Sabbath points them to the works of creation as an evidence of
His mighty power in redemption. While it calls to mind the
lost peace of Eden, it tells of peace restored through the Sav-
iour."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 288, 289.
   In what way is the Sabbath an antidote to apostate wor-
ship, atheism, and false concepts regarding the origin of life?
Gen. 2:2, 3; Heb. 4:4-9 (compare Mark 2:27, 28).

  Holiness is not just moral purity. It is being set apart for
God's purpose and use. The Sabbath is the epitome of true
worship and holiness.
    How can we prevent Sabbath observance from becoming
 a formal routine?
                                                                55
 Friday                                        November 4
FURTHER STUDY: The apostles were keenly conscious that in
presenting Christ as the Saviour, they were also exalting Him
as the Creator. See Acts 4:24-29; 14:15-18; 17:22-31; Ephesians
3:8-15. Meditate on how this knowledge affected their ability to
witness for Him amid enormous opposition, ignorance, and
diverse forms of idolatry that were deeply embedded in all the
cultures of the world. In what ways does our era resemble that
of the apostles, and how does God's call to worship Him as
Creator have special timeliness for the modern world?
   Read The Acts of the Apostles, p. 317, "A Higher Standard."
 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Modern civilization has strayed from worshiping God as
     Creator. How has this deviation affected people's rela-
     tionship to humanity, religion, the environment, nature,
     government, science, the arts, and the future?
     2. Match these texts on the characteristics of true worship,
        with the appropriate idea:
       Phil. 2:10, 11; 3:3      a.   reverence
       Isa. 63:7                b.   doctrinal purity
       Ps. 89:7                 c.   repentance
       Ps. 25:5                 d.   Christ-centeredness
       1 John 1:3               e.   thankful praise
       Luke 18:13, 14           f.   fellowship/relationships
     3. How has this week's lesson contributed to your under-
        standing of the relevance of the first angel's message,
        especially with regard to worshiping God as Creator?
SUMMARY: The first angel's call to "worship him that made
heaven, and earth" directs us to our Creator and Saviour, Jesus
Christ. Why? So He can restore our relationship with Him and
His image in us. The Sabbath is an important part of this
message. On this special day of worship we can set aside all
our temporal cares in order to focus completely on Christ and
His creative and redemptive work.

Mahal   Al'sap                  A Time to Serve
                                   Gavin Anthony

              I stared out of my window. Plaster hung off crumbling
          buildings. People trudged slowly along the streets. Everything
          looked so worn-out. My thoughts turned toward home.
              In my dorm room overlooking the green fields of Newbold
          College, my telephone rang. "We need someone to go to
          Albania to pastor the new members." The minister's voice
          sounded urgent. "Can you go for four months?"
              How could I go? I was in the middle of my studies. But I
          promised to pray about it.
              The college administrator assured me, "We'll work it out." I
          could leave my job. I caught the next plane to Albania.
              Seated in the airplane, I wondered what I could offer these
          people. They had suffered so much and had so little!
              Soon after I arrived I went to the town of Elbasan. As we
          neared the city we saw a huge industrial complex that nearly
          filled the valley. Once employing 15,000 people, it now stood
          idle, a monument to the failed political system.
              But in the middle of this economic graveyard I found people
          eager to learn about Christianity. Many had never seen a New
          Testament before. We sat around a small wooden table,
          Testaments open and eyes alert. I begain talking about Jesus.
              "Who is Jesus?" I asked. I received only quizzical looks.
          They didn't know! "God," I prayed, "speak through me." He
          did.
              In that city filled with discouragement, seeds of hope began
          to sprout. The eager group began to grasp the biblical truths.
              The weeks sped past. Students from Newbold arrived
          during Christmas vacation to help with Branch Sabbath Schools
          and evangelistic meetings. Hearts stirred, and faith awakened.
          A Christian community was forming.
              Then suddenly my assignment was over. Back at Newbold,
           I sat in class. Faces I had learned to love and places in
           desperate need filled my thoughts. Now I knew what I had to
          do when I finished college. I must work to reach others for
           Christ. I am glad I was called to Albania. It changed my life.

              Gavin Anthony completed his degree in religion in June 1993, and
          is now serving as a Pastor in England.

      Babylon the Pretender



Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Rev. 14:8; 17:1-6; Jer. 51:5-
11.
     MEMORY TEXT: "And there followed another angel, say-
     ing, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she
     made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her
     fornication" (Revelation 14:8).

   KEY THOUGHT: God proclaims the dangers and downfall
of all false religious philosophies and practices, and calls upon
people everywhere to receive true salvation through His gos-
pel of redemption and reconciliation. (Review Lesson 2.)
   GOD'S WARNINGS ARE DESIGNED TO SAVE. The sec-
ond angel's message is an urgent appeal motivated by God's
love and uncompromising truth. This message takes the form
of denunciation and implied retribution because false systems
of salvation in general and Christendom in particular have
rejected the light of the first angel's message.
   "The first angel's message of Revelation 14, announcing the
hour of God's judgment and calling upon men to fear and
worship Him, was designed to separate the professed people
of God from the corrupting influences of the world and to
arouse them to see their true condition of worldliness and
backsliding. In this message, God had sent to the church a
warning, which, had it been accepted, would have corrected
the evils that were shutting them away from Him."—The Great
Controversy, p. 379.
   Historically, the clarion call of the second angel's message
began in the summer of 1844 but now is being sounded world-
wide.

BABYLON'S FEATURES (Rev. 17:1-6).
  The second angel comes from heaven to unite with the first
angel: "And there followed another angel" (Rev. 14:8). The
word follow in the original means "to join as a companion with
one who precedes." (See Rev. 14:4 and Luke 5:11.) We can
readily conclude from the wording of the text that the second
angel unites with the first to extend and amplify the original
message. The second angel does not detract from or drown out
the first angel's message, but gives it fresh impetus, urgency,
and relevance.
  What are the characteristics of Babylon that merit God's
condemnation? Rev. 17:2-6; 18:2, 3, 9-14, 24.

   The identity of criminals is sometimes more surely estab-
lished by their description than by their name. Many people
can bear the same name. And people may even change their
names. But everyone's identity is unquestionably established
by a thorough description of his or her locale, character, associ-
ates, and deeds. Babylon is a symbolic name signifying a power
whose identity is determined by the record of its operations,
sphere of action, and ideas.
   "The term 'Babylon' is derived from 'Babel,' and signifies
confusion. It is employed in Scripture to designate false or
apostate religions. In Revelation 17, Babylon is represented as a
woman—a figure which is used in the Bible as the symbol of a
church, a virtuous woman representing a pure church, a vile
woman an apostate church."—The Great Controversy, p. 381.
   It is lamentable that human beings—God's creatures— should
devise and enjoy false systems of religion, thus degenerating
into a condition of spiritual whoredom. But so it is represented
in Scripture. This representation is no jest or exaggerated meta-
phor, but a solemn indictment from the Divine Judge, who
makes no mistakes or false accusations.
   How can we avoid being ensnared by Babylon? 1 Peter 3:8-
12 (compare 2 Thess. 1:11, 12; 2:13, 14).

   What corruptions or weaknesses exist in my life that
 make me subject to the demoralizing influences of Babylon?
 What help has God provided to give me the victory?

BABYLON'S FORTRESS (Rev 14:8; 16:13, 14, 19; 17:1-5, 18).

   Babylon signifies apostasy at its most ingenious, industri-
ous, and deliberate level. It makes its first appearance in em-
bryo form not many generations after the Flood. By gathering
into one huge cluster, the mass of humanity acted contrary to
God's instruction to disperse over the whole earth (Gen. 9:7).
They resolved to build a city and a tower for their protection,
fortification, and fame. Thus they saw Babel, their new city in
the plain of Shinar, as the prospective capital of a universal
empire, whose splendor would command the homage of the
world. Because rebellion against God and exaltation of self
were at the heart of this project, the Lord scattered the partici-
pants and divided the languages of the world to check the
progress of evil. See Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 118-124, "The
Tower of Babel."
   What is Babylon explicitly said to be? Rev. 14:8; 16:13, 14,
19; 17:1-5, 18.

   While Babylon symbolizes any false religious system, in the
last days it will specifically involve the worldwide union of the
papacy, apostate Protestantism, and modern spiritism. At God's
command, this union will lose its power, just as did the first
city of Babel (Rev. 16:17; 17:17). See SDA Bible Commentary, vol.
7, p. 847.
   "It [Babylon] cannot be Pagan Rome, but Papal Rome, if a
particular seat of error be meant, but . . . the judgment (ch. 18:2)
and the spiritual fornication (ch. 18:3), though finding their
culmination in Rome, are not restricted to it, but comprise the
whole apostate Church, Roman, Greek, and even Protestant, so
far as it has been seduced from its 'first love' (ch. 2:4) to Christ,
the heavenly Bridegroom, and given its affections to worldly
pomps and idols."—Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown, eds., Com-
mentary on the Whole Bible (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan,
n.d.), on Rev. 17:2.
   "By her [Babylon's] daughters must be symbolized churches
that cling to her doctrines and traditions, and follow her ex-
ample of sacrificing the truth and the approval of God, in order
to form an unlawful alliance with the world. The message of
Revelation 14 announcing the fall of Babylon must apply to
religious bodies that were once pure and have become cor-
rupt."—The Great Controversy, pp. 382, 383.

BABYLON'S FALSITY (Rev. 18:2, 3).

   Babylon's chief flaw can be summarized in one word—
idolatry (Jer. 50:2, 38), a sin forbidden by the first and second
commandments of God (Ex. 20:3-6).

   What are the effects of idolatry that make it so abominable
in the sight of God?

Rom. 1:21-32

Eze. 14:1-4

Ps. 106:36-40

   Human ideas, formed apart from the inspired instructions
of God's Word, are thoroughly degrading to the human spirit,
leading to misdeeds and false systems of salvation. Unrepen-
tant sinners incline toward ever-lower forms of degeneracy.
Lacking the Holy Spirit's guidance, their minds operate under
the influence of Satan (Eph. 2:1-3), who uses false philosophy
and religion to separate them from their Creator.
   "No outward shrine may be visible; there may be no image
for the eye to rest upon; yet thousands are following after the
gods of this world—after riches, fame, pleasure, and the pleas-
ing fables that permit man to follow the inclinations of the
unregenerate heart. Multitudes have a wrong conception of
God and His attributes, and are as truly serving a false god as
were the worshipers of Baal. . . .
    "Human theories are exalted and placed where God and
His law should be. . . . There is seen a spirit of opposition to the
plain word of God, of idolatrous exaltation of human wisdom
above divine revelation."—Prophets and Kings, pp. 177, 178.
    Chief of the idolatrous offenses of our age are the false
doctrines taught in professed Christian churches. These in-
clude salvation by works, life immediately after death, and a
false day of worship. Christ calls His followers to be the light
of the world. This they can be only as they follow the light of
His Word (Ps. 119:105; John 14:23; Phil. 2:15, 16) and discard all
 traditions contrary to Scripture.
   What idols, including those that none can see or touch,
 might there be in my life? How can I discover these idols
 and put them out of my life forever? When can a good thing
 become an idol, and how can this problem be remedied?

BABYLON'S WINE, WRATH, AND FORNICATION (Isa.
29:9-13).

  What does wine signify in the spiritual sense? Isa. 29:9-13;
Deut. 32:32-34.


   Babylon's "wine" is the antithesis of the "living water" of
eternal life and the anointing of the Spirit (John 4:10, 14; 7:37-
39; Rev. 22:1). The wine signifies false teachings and the influ-
ence of demons.
   "The great sin charged against Babylon is that she 'made all
nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.' This
cup of intoxication which she presents to the world represents
the false doctrines that she has accepted as the result of her
unlawful connection with the great ones of the earth."—The
Great Controversy, p. 388.
   How could false doctrine so potently deceive people that
their spiritual condition is compared to drunkenness? Prov.
23:31-33.


   Two of Babylon's chief fallacies are: (1) the doctrine of the
natural immortality of the soul. This is an unscriptural belief.
(See Ps. 146:3, 4; Eccl. 9:5, 6, 10; Isa. 38:18, 19; 1 Cor. 15:22, 23,
53, 54.) It paves the way for demons to impersonate the dead.
Thus they can teach false ideas to normally rational minds. (2)
Sunday sacredness (or any other day considered sacred) re-
placing the true Sabbath, which is a sign of God's ability to
create and to make us holy (Ex. 20:8-11; Eze. 20:12). Belief in a
false day of worship negates the authority of God's law and
helps to obscure the record of humanity's origins and God's
true means of salvation (Gen. 2:1-3; Eccl. 3:14).

  Babylon's wine is called "the wine of . . . wrath" (Rev.
14:8). The cause of this wrath is explained by the texts below.
Match each text with the appropriate idea.

Hatred of truth                                   Acts 19:25-28
Resentment of having sins rebuked                 Eph. 2:3
Perversity and combativeness of heart             Acts 7:51-58
Spirit of persecution toward the godly            Luke 4:24-28
Addiction to idolatrous, luxurious living         Gal. 4:29

BABYLON'S FALL (Jer. 51:8, 9).

   Why did God pronounce judgment upon the nations of
old regarding their social and religious conduct?

Jer. 50:2, 14, 33, 34

Dan. 9:9-11

Isa. 24:1-6

   God is exceedingly slow to anger and long-suffering beyond
compare. He follows every possible method of reconciliation
and restoration before visiting any person or nation in wrath.
But when His mercy and patience are treated with bold con-
tempt and taken as a signal to transgress divine law without
compunction or restraint, then the hand of judgment is stretched
forth with a power that shatters the strength of the wicked and
overturns all their devices. (See Prov. 1:24-33; Eccl. 8:11. Read
Prophets and Kings, pp. 276, 277, "Nineveh, That Great City.")


   What did God seek to do for ancient Babylon? What does
this reveal about His thoughts toward spiritual Babylon? Jer.
51:8, 9 (compare Rev. 2:18-23; Eze. 33:11).

   The fall of Babylon has been a progressive one. Humanism,
spiritualism, commercialism, fraud, and false doctrines of
every kind reveal Babylon's denial of the Scriptures' divine
authority. Human opinions and false systems of salvation, formed
under the inspiration of demons, have largely supplanted the
teachings of the Bible. Few insist on a plain "thus saith the
Lord" over the assertions of self-styled spiritual leaders. Few
are like the Bereans, who received the word of God with all
readiness of mind and tested all ideas by the supreme author-
ity of Holy Writ. Meanwhile, those in Babylon who take the
word of God seriously, resolving by divine grace to obey the
whole counsel of God, shall heed Heaven's call: "Come out of
her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye
receive not of her plagues" (Rev. 18:4).

    What can I do to influence others to separate from apos-
 tate ideas and churches and join God's true remnant?




                                                              63
Friday                                       November 11
FURTHER STUDY: As you read Isaiah 21:8-10; 47; Jeremiah 51
and 52; and Daniel 5, consider the spiritual parallels between
the character of the ancient Babylonian Empire and modern
mystic Babylon.
   For an inspired exposition of the second angel's message
and treatment of its historic background, read "A Warning
Rejected," in The Great Controversy, pp. 381-390; "The Second
Angel's Message," in The Story of Redemption, pp. 364-368; "The
Second Angel's Message," Early Writings, pp. 237-240.

   Some have advanced the idea that the Seventh-day Adventist
Church is Babylon, or so much like it as to come under the
same condemnation as Babylon. But consider this inspired coun-
sel: "Beware of those who arise with a great burden to de-
nounce the church. . . . How dare mortal man pass his judg-
ment . . . and call the church a harlot, Babylon, a den of
thieves. . . . Is this the message we have to bear to Seventh-day
Adventists? I tell you, no! God has given no man any such
message."—This Day With God, p. 172.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How can we give the second angel's message without
     being condemnatory while at the same time being faith-
     ful to its solemn warnings?

     2. What are some of the popular errors of religious Babylon
        (besides the false sabbath and the doctrine of natural
        immortality of the soul)?

     3. List as many evidences as possible to show why Protes-
        tantism is fallen.

     4. A good question to ask ourselves: We have come out of
        Babylon, but has Babylon gone out of our hearts? Cite
        Bible examples of people leaving what God asked them
        to leave but not letting go in heart the old ways.

SUMMARY: In consequence of people's rejecting the first angel's
message, God proclaims the fall of Babylon (false religions in
general, apostate Christianity in particular) to warn us of the
fatal outcome of clinging to error. He likens Babylon's false
doctrine to maddening wine, because demons have crafted
Babylon's deadly lies to destroy truth and its adherents. But
Babylon will collapse, while truth will triumph.

                              From Drugs to God
         511i7                    Alejandro Bullon

             Lucio Mercado and Abel Claudio were drug dealers from
          Bolivia who were arrested and imprisoned for their illegal drug
          activities. But one day the gospel reached them, and they
          accepted Jesus as their Saviour.
             Released from prison, Lucio and Abel wanted to share what
          Jesus had done for them. They decided to begin a special work
          to help rehabilitate drug users and reach them with the gospel.
          In this way they hoped to repair some of the damage they had
          done in the past while dealing with drugs.
              The Adventist Church in South America had no organized
          work among people addicted to drugs. Today these two lay
          members have established the first SDA Drug Recovery Cen-
          ter, located in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, on property donated by the
          city! In addition, with the help of friends, Lucio and Abel are
          building a house to rehabilitate drug addicts. Already these
          two men have been instrumental in the rehabilitation of several
          former drug abusers.
              One man who found help is Gabriel, a member of a wealthy
          and prominent family in Santa Cruz. Gabriel speaks four
          languages and used to work as a traffic controller in the city's
          international airport. But alcoholism and drugs destroyed
          everything he had. He lost his family, his job, his dignity, and
          his self-respect. During the day he walked the streets of Santa
          Cruz; at night he slept in the cemetery in empty tombs.
              Then someone took him to the Recovery Center. Four
          months later, Gabriel is rehabilitated. All those who knew him
          are surprised at his new outlook. His own family is so
          impressed at the change in Gabriel, they now attend church and
          want to know better the God who was able to transform
          Gabriel.
              God often calls us to work with those we know best, people
          with whom we live, work, or share common interests. Lucio
          and Abel responded to God's call to work among the people
           they knew best drug dealers and addicts. And He is blessing
           their efforts with souls for eternity.

        Satan's Mark Versus
            God's Seal




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Rev. 7:1-14; 13:11-18; 14:1-
5, 9-12; Eze. 20:12, 20.
     MEMORY TEXT: "Then I looked, and there before me was
     the Lamb, standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000
     who had his name and his Father's name written on their
     foreheads" (Revelation 14:1, NIV).
   KEY THOUGHT: God will place His end-time seal upon
those whom He vindicates in the pre-Advent judgment—those
who claim Christ's righteousness as their own and who con-
form to Him in character as a result of the indwelling Holy
Spirit. They obey God's law, including the Sabbath of the fourth
commandment. Those who will receive the mark of the beast
are conformed in character to Satan. Their rebellion against
God is evidenced by observance of an apostate day of worship.
   RECEIVING GOD'S SEAL OR THE MARK OF THE BEAST
REVEALS THE CHARACTER OF EACH INDIVIDUAL'S
RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE. The essence of the third angel's
message is the experience of justification by faith. (See Selected
Messages, book 1, p. 372.) We receive God's seal, not because of
our works, but because we accept Christ's sacrifice on our
behalf, and obey God's law by the power of His Holy Spirit.
   The third angel amplifies the preceding messages and high-
lights the final issues in the great controversy between good
and evil. How the seal of God and the mark of the beast relate
to these issues is the subject of this week's lesson.

Sunday                                       November 13
THE SEAL OF GOD, PART 1 (Rev. 14:1-5).

   When is the seal of the Holy Spirit first given to an indi-
vidual? Eph. 1:12-14; 4:30.

   The Holy Spirit takes up residence in the heart of the indi-
vidual who is born again. (See John 3:5, 6; Rom. 8:9, 10.) The
Spirit brings the righteousness of Christ and the gift of eternal
life (John 3:36), and He empowers the believer to obey God's
law (Rom. 8:1-4). Thus the first seal of the Holy Spirit is the
new-birth experience. According to Ephesians 1:14, the Spirit is
the "earnest" (KJV), or the "guarantee" (RSV) that we will be
given an eternal inheritance at the second coming of Jesus. The
Greek word used here means "first installment, deposit, down
payment, pledge." (Compare 2 Cor. 1:22; 5:5.)
   A seal places its image on the objects receiving its impress. It
is God's purpose that we should be conformed to the image of
His Son, and be sealed by being partakers of the divine nature
(Rom. 8:29; 2 Peter 1:4).
  Describe the character of those people who receive God's
end-time seal. Compare Revelation 7:1-3 with 14:1-5.

   The second seal of the Holy Spirit is the end-time seal given to
those who, by daily commitment to Christ, are maintaining
their born-again experience and, thus, are having victory over
sin. Revelation 7:3 and 14:1 state that the 144,000 are sealed in
their foreheads. They are established in the truth intellectually
and spiritually. The name of Christ and the Father placed in
their foreheads symbolizes that, through the Holy Spirit, they
are partakers of God's character. They enjoy the new-covenant
experience, and thus have the law of God inscribed in their
hearts (Heb. 8:10-12). Freed while on this earth from the taint of
both legalism and disobedience, in the heavenly kingdom they
will follow the Lamb wherever He goes (Rev. 7:14, 15; 14:4).
   God's faithful ones are sealed before the winds of strife are let
loose toward the end of world history (Rev. 7:1-3). Filled with
God's Spirit, they are entirely free from acts of sin, "for they are
spotless" (Rev. 14:5, RSV). The Greek word means "unblem-
ished, blameless." (It is also used in Eph. 1:4; 5:27; Col. 1:22;
Jude 24.)
    Is there something we can do to ensure that we receive
 the end-time seal of God?
                                                                 67
Monday                                       November 14
THE SEAL OF GOD, PART 2 (Heb. 4:4-11; Matt. 11:28-30).

   The religious experience of those who receive God's end-
time seal before the close of probation (when the winds of
strife are let loose) is pure, divested of all the unholy elements
of Babylon. Furthermore, they are united to God's true church,
and thus are spoken of in symbolic language as "virgins" (Rev.
14:4). They cooperate with Him in proclaiming the three an-
gels' messages to the world. Their spiritual influence derives
from the intimacy of their walk with Christ, who claims them
to be without fault before His throne, the seat of His judgment
and mercy.

  What special sign symbolizes the sealing of God's people?
Eze. 20:12, 20 (compare Ex. 31:12, 13).


   God has chosen observance of His Sabbath to be the distin-
guishing seal or sign of a loyal, living connection with Himself!
(Note that the words sign and seal are used synonymously in
Rom. 4:11.) God's Sabbath is a seal or sign of the power and
authority that are His by virtue of His role as Creator, Sustainer,
and Redeemer. In observing His Sabbath, we affirm the effects
of His power and authority in our lives. (See Eph. 4:23, 24.)
   When we engage in true Sabbath observance, the Sabbath is
a sign that we are God's chosen people. It also becomes a
pledge that He will fulfill His covenant promises to us. Our
part is to obey under the empowerment of the Holy Spirit. (See
Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 350.)

   What is the connection between sanctification of character
and Sabbath observance? Heb. 4:4-11 (compare Matt. 11:28-
30; Deut. 10:12, 13; Eze. 36:26, 27).


   "The seal of the living God is placed upon those who consci-
entiously keep the Sabbath of the Lord."—Ellen White Com-
ments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 980.
   "Those who receive the seal of the living God and are pro-
tected in the time of trouble must reflect the image of Jesus
fully."—Early Writings, p. 71.
   "No one need say that his case is hopeless, that he cannot
live the life of a Christian. Ample provision is made by the
death of Christ for every soul. . . . It is now that we must wash
our robes of character and make them white in the blood of the
Lamb."—Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 215, 216.

HALLMARK OF APOSTASY (Rev. 13:16, 17).

   The alternative to the seal of God is the mark of the beast—
the hallmark of apostate Christian authority exercised without
regard for individual choice or conscience.

   What clues do we have concerning the identity of the mark
of the beast? Dan. 7:25; 8:23-25.


    Daniel was shown in vision that an apostate religious power,
arising from the ruins of the Roman Empire, would have world-
controlling influence. This power would make great preten-
sions to infallible divine authority; it would suppress God's
Word and persecute His people while exercising a 1260-year
period of dominion in Europe. (Compare Dan. 7:25; 12:7; Rev.
11:3; 12:6, 14; 13:5.) As the capstone of its apostasy, this power
would "think to change times and laws." The Ten Command-
ments, the supreme moral law of the universe, have only one
law that deals with time—the Sabbath—the very law that con-
tains the seal of the Lawgiver's identity: the Creator of the
universe.
    In numerous official statements the Roman Catholic Church
has taken full credit for changing the Sabbath of God's ten
commandments to the first day of the week. The following is
from the 1977 edition of The Convert's Catechism of Catholic
Doctrine: "Q. Which is the Sabbath day? A. Saturday is the
Sabbath day. Q. Why do we observe Sunday instead of Satur-
day? A. We observe Sunday instead of Saturday because the
Catholic Church transferred the solemnity from Saturday to
Sunday."—Peter Geiermann (Rockford, Ill.: Tan Books and Pub-
lishers, 1977), p. 50.
    The Roman Catholic scholar John A. O'Brien says in his
best-selling book The Faith of Millions: "Since Saturday, not
Sunday, is specified in the Bible, isn't it curious that non-
Catholics who profess to take their religion directly from the
Bible, and not from the Church, observe Sunday instead of
Saturday?" He continues by saying that the custom of Sunday
keeping "rests upon the authority of the Catholic Church and
 not upon an explicit text in the Bible."—Revised edition (Hun-
 tington, Ind.: Our Sunday Visitor, Inc., 1974), pp. 400, 401.

   "What then is the change of the Sabbath, but the sign, or
 mark, of the authority of the Roman Church—'the mark of
 the beast'?"—The Great Controversy, p. 448.

                                                               69

THE CRUCIAL TEST (Rev. 14:9; 12:17).
   In saying, "If any man worship the beast and his image"
(Rev. 14:9), the Lord is showing us that all can resist the power
of evil by the faith of Jesus. We need not consider ourselves so
weak or hemmed in by circumstances that we have to capitu-
late to the power of the beast. Here God emphasizes freedom of
choice, religious liberty, and justification by faith, rather than a
system of imposed works and fruitless worship from a power
claiming to be the channel of God's grace while acting in direct
opposition to His word. He authorizes none to punish and
persecute in the realm of personal conscience, but emphasizes
our individual accountability to Him for our religious faith.
   What teachings found in God's Word prohibit compulsory
religion and religious persecution? Luke 9:49-56 (compare
Rom. 14:10-13; 1 Cor. 10:29; 2 Cor. 3:17).

   God created human beings with freedom of choice. Compul-
sion is the devil's domain. Through cruelty, fear, and force he
attempts to govern our conscience and to secure our loyalty for
himself. He does so by compelling religious and worldly gov-
ernments to make and enforce laws that are contrary to God's
law. (See The Great Controversy, p. 591.)
   Why is opposition to the Sabbath so important in Satan's
campaign of rebellion against the government of God? Ex.
20:8-11; Matt. 4:8-10; Isa. 51:12, 13.

   Whoever attempts to alter any part of God's law presumes
to be a higher authority than God. To change the Sabbath
strikes from the Decalogue the name, title, and jurisdiction of
the Lawgiver (LORD God, the Creator of the Universe). The
one true God is uniquely identifiable by His Creatorship (Ps.
96:4, 5). In Romans 1:18-32, Paul describes the effects of forget-
ting the Creator and our accountability to Him. Knowing this,
Satan has chosen to supplant the Sabbath, substituting a false
day of worship to be enforced by earthly powers.
   "The Sabbath will be the great test of loyalty, for it is the
point of truth especially controverted."—The Great Controversy,
p. 605.
  Why is government-mandated religion unacceptable to
God?

ENFORCERS OF THE MARK (Rev. 13:11-18).

   Two beasts are brought to view in Revelation 13 that are
symbolic of earthly powers (compare Dan. 7:3, 17, 23-25). The
first beast represents the papacy, as can be determined by its
blasphemous pretensions to holiness, its persecuting activity,
the duration of its reign, its geographic headquarters, and the
extensiveness of its influence. (See The Great Controversy, pp.
54, 55.)
   Shortly after the 1260-year period of papal predominance
(A.D. 538-1798), a new nation arose, destined to achieve unpar-
alleled economic and social influence.

   List the characteristics of this nation, represented by the
second beast. Rev. 13:11-17.


   Only one country fulfills all the specifications of this proph-
ecy—the United States. The lamblike horns represent the two
main features of the American system of government, civil and
religious liberty, both of which are guaranteed in the Constitu-
tion. Civil liberty has been established by government of the
people, in the interests of the people. Religious liberty has
resulted from acceptance of the principles of tolerance taught
in the New Testament. This civil and religious liberty provided
a climate whereby the truth of one Mediator [Christ] between
God and humanity could be freely taught.
   The prophecy indicates that the United States eventually
will become the chief ally of revived papal power and policies.
"Laws enforcing the observance of Sunday as the Sabbath will
bring about a national apostasy from the principles of republi-
canism upon which the government has been founded. The
religion of the papacy will be accepted by the rulers, and the
law of God will be made void."—Last Day Events, p. 132.
   "As America . . . shall unite with the papacy in forcing the
conscience and compelling men to honor the false sabbath, the
people of every country on the globe will be led to follow her
example."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 18. (See Rev. 13:12; read The
Great Controversy, pp. 439-446, "God's Law Immutable.")

   The seal of God is symbolically spoken of as being placed
 only upon the forehead of believers. Why do you think the
 mark of the beast is symbolically spoken of as being placed
 on either the forehead or the hand of its recipients? (Com-
 pare Rev. 13:16; Isa. 33:14, 15; 59:3, 6.)

                                                               71

FURTHER STUDY: Review Revelation 13 and 14. Read the
"Impending Conflict" in Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 711-718. Con-
sider what you can do to be a sentinel for religious liberty and
the proclamation of the third angel's message, which exalts the
commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.

   Just as the Sabbath is not experientially God's seal until we
have entered by faith into Christ's spiritual rest, so people do
not receive the mark of the beast until they knowingly choose
this false day of worship over the true. The following quotation
will help us to understand when people will receive the mark
of the beast:
   "When Sunday observance shall be enforced by law, and the
world shall be enlightened concerning the obligation of the
true Sabbath, then whoever shall transgress the command of
God, to obey a precept that has no higher authority than that of
Rome, will thereby honor popery above God. He is paying
homage to Rome and to the power which enforces the institu-
tion ordained by Rome. He is worshiping the beast and his
image. . . . And it is not until the issue is thus plainly set before
the people, and they are brought to choose between the com-
mandments of God and the commandments of men, that those
who continue in transgression will receive 'the mark of the
beast.' "—The Great Controversy, p. 449.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What are the religious causes of the present-day revival
     of papal power?

     2. How can we experience the true revival that enables us to
        proclaim fully the commandments of God and the faith
        of Jesus?

     3. What effect will the quality of our Sabbathkeeping have
        upon our facing the ultimate crisis over the Sabbath/
        Sunday conflict?

SUMMARY: The issues connected with the mark of the beast
(Sunday worship) versus the seal of God (the scriptural Sab-
bath) are sharp and distinct. They highlight the distinction
between Christ's covenant of truth, grace, and voluntary wor-
ship, and Satan's counterfeit covenant distinguished by error,
human works, and compulsory worship. Christ's covenant is
epitomized by His Sabbath. Satan's counterfeit is typified by a
substitute sabbath (Sunday) bearing the signature of apostasy.

Global AUssisi               In Spite of Bombs

    7       "You'll have to evacuate the building. We have received
         word that there is a bomb in the building!" The Russian
         policeman's words interrupted my sermon. While our musi-
         cians played music for the 500 people waiting in the audience,
         the policeman continued. "Don't tell the people what is
         happening; it might scare them. Just ask them to evacuate the
         building."
             Emil and Ruth Moldric and I were holding an evangelistic
         series in Kemerovo, Russia, a town in central Siberia. Before
         the meetings began, we met and prayed on Sabbath with our
         Adventist believers in a little wooden church that wouldn't
         hold 30 people. And now an average of 700 were attending
         nightly meetings in the Drama Theater. The auditorium held
         about 500 people, so we had two meetings a night. We were
         meeting with success, but now a bomb scare threatened to
         disrupt our meetings.
             I walked back onto the stage with the translator and told the
         people, "The police are here; they say they have received word
         that a bomb has been planted in the building." The people
         began to shake their heads and say, "Niet, niet. We don't
         believe it." I told the congregation that if they wanted to leave
         they may do so, but that I would remain and continue my
         sermon. Not one person left, and the meeting continued with
         no further interruption.
             During the meetings the Russian Orthodox Church held a
         parade and a rally. The Orthodox priest spoke against the
          foreign evangelists in town. He wanted to discourage people
          from attending the meetings. In spite of this, meetings
          continued with good attendance for 30 days. We gave inter-
          ested people Bibles, and held a nightly Bible class and a stop
          smoking clinic, as well.
             After the meetings ended, we rented a hall so church
          members can continue to meet three evenings a week and
          follow up the interests gleaned from the evangelistic meetings.
                                So far more than 165 have been baptized,
                                and many more are studying for baptism,
                                despite parades, speeches, and bomb
                                threats.

           The Wrath of God




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Rev. 14:9-11; Isa. 10:1-4;
Zech. 7:12; 1 Thess 5:9.

     MEMORY TEXT: "The wrath of God is being revealed
     from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness
     of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness" (Ro-
     mans 1:18, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Our God is a God of perfect justice as well
as of perfect mercy. Through the gospel of grace, He has pro-
vided a way for all humankind to be saved. Those who cling to
sin engage in such a course of rebellious living that for the
welfare of the universe, God must end their existence. But
Christ drank the cup of justice for us so that no one need be
destroyed.

   GOD'S WRATH REVEALS HIS UNCOMPROMISING
RIGHTEOUSNESS AND LOVE. Some regard the subject of
God's wrath as a challenge to the integrity of their religious
experience. The third angel's message impels us to study the
question of God's wrath because it is predicted to be poured
out in full measure. What provokes the wrath of the most
patient, kind, and merciful being in the universe? How is His
wrath consistent with His love? What form does His wrath
take, and why? What provision has He made that none should
experience His wrath if they truly wish to escape it? These are
the questions we shall explore this week.

Sunday                                     November 20
DIVINE WRATH—ITS REASON (Ex. 34:5-7; James 2:12, 13).
   How do the following verses describe God's character?
1 John 4:8, 16, 18; Ex. 34:5-7.

   All that God does is consistent with His character of love.
Christ died for us while we were yet sinners. He seeks to draw
every sinner into a saving relationship with Himself. But He
must destroy those who beat back His waves of mercy and
cling to sin. Why? Because the righteousness of God requires
that sin and sinners be eradicated for their own sake and the
sake of the loyal universe. Willfully unrepentant sinners are
filled with unyielding hostility toward God and His people.
(See Rom. 1:28-32; 8:7.)
  Read Mark 3:1-5 and Matthew 23:25-38. Why did Christ
express anger toward the Pharisees? How can we tell that
there was no malice or animosity in His anger?

   "Christ's indignation was directed against the hypocrisy,
the gross sins, by which men were destroying their own souls,
deceiving the people and dishonoring God. In the specious
deceptive reasoning of the priests and rulers He discerned the
working of satanic agencies. Keen and searching had been His
denunciation of sin; but He spoke no words of retaliation. He
had a holy wrath against the prince of darkness; but He mani-
fested no irritated temper. So the Christian who lives in har-
mony with God, possessing the sweet attributes of love and
mercy, will feel a righteous indignation against sin; but he will
not be roused by passion to revile those who revile him."—The
Desire of Ages, pp. 619, 620.
   Explain James 1:19, 20; 2:12, 13 in relation to policies and
 penalties connected with the enforcement of the mark of the
 beast.

    Those who accept and enforce the mark of the beast show no
 mercy or justice to those whose sole offense is refusal to submit
 to a rebellious edict that defies the law of God, which they love
 and peaceably obey.
     Why would it not be consistent with God's character of
  love to permanently allow sin, rebellion, and persecution?
                                                               75
Monday                                        November 21
DIVINE WRATH—ITS RELUCTANCE (Eze. 33:10, 11; 2 Peter
3:9).
   What do the following texts teach about God's attitude
regarding the punishment of sinners? Eze. 33:10, 11; 2 Peter
3:9; 2 Chron. 36:14-16.

   God's justice involves His sometimes abandoning us to the
dire results of our own choices. But God never ceases to love us,
even as we march off to certain destruction. God does not
change from love to wrath or vice versa. Notice how Jesus
responded to the rich young ruler (Luke 18:15-23). God is not
vindictive, as we might be.
   "Our Creator and our Commander, infinite in power, ter-
rible in justice, seeks by every means to bring men to see and
repent of their sins. . . . [But] He cannot uphold and guard a
people who reject His counsel and despise His reproofs."
—Prophets and Kings, p. 426 (compare The Great Controversy, p.
627). "The very fact of His reluctance to execute justice testifies
to the enormity of the sins that call forth His judgments and to
the severity of the retribution awaiting the transgressor."
—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 628.
   The third angel's message presents the horrors of the second
death, an ordeal that Christ alone has thus far experienced.
Hence this message is a graphic final appeal for this morally
degraded world to receive Christ, to be neither intimidated by
the beast nor enchanted by his mystic arts.
   This message lifts up the Lamb of God against the backdrop
of hell-fire, for He stands between us and it, ready to pardon
our sins and take them away. He pleads with us, "Behold My
Calvary love. Do not suffer the agonies of the second death,
which I have already endured for you."
   The severity of the punishment is designed to make us ask,
"What is sin that it should so provoke the wrath of God?" The
answer comes back from the holy Word, "Sin is the transgres-
sion of the law" (1 John 3:4). This realization, impressed upon
the conscience by the power of the Holy Spirit, will lead multi-
tudes to recognize that the Decalogue, including the Sabbath
commandment, was not abrogated at Calvary, but is still in
full, eternal effect.
   How does the fact that "the law reveals the attributes of
God's character" (The Desire of Ages, p. 762; Ps. 19:7, 8;
119:172; Rom. 7:12) shed light upon the definition and re-
sults of sin in 1 John 3:4 and Isaiah 59:2?
76
Tuesday                                     November 22
DIVINE WRATH—ITS RELEASE (Rev. 6:14-17; 15:1).

   God's numerous warnings to sinners attest to His desire to
save rather than destroy. If our cases were hopeless, God would
not warn us. If He had no concern about our destiny, He would
not plead for us to turn from sin and live. The warnings that
thankless sinners look upon as harassment and intimidating
threats are really the appeals of divine mercy pressing to the
limits of its forbearance and long-suffering. The final outpour-
ing of God's Spirit, coupled with the proclamation of His gos-
pel, exalting both law and grace, will bring everyone to a point
of decision by which their destiny will be fixed.
   At the end of time, the wicked will decide not to tolerate the
existence of God's commandment-keeping people, who have
the faith of Jesus. The beliefs and example of those who are
sealed will become a vexation to the perverted consciences of
the lost. Their universal cry will be, "Away with such people
from the earth: for it is not fit that they should live." (Compare
Acts 22:22.)

   When this state of affairs is reached, what action does God
take? Rev. 14:10; 15:1; 16:1 (compare Lev. 26:23-25; 2 Thess.
1:6).


   God will punish the incorrigible transgressors of His law.
The persecuting hatred visited upon His faithful, obedient people
will provoke His wrath.
    "When Christ ceases His intercession in the sanctuary, the
unmingled wrath threatened against those who worship the
beast and his image and receive his mark will be poured
out. . . . By condemning the people of God to death, they have
as truly incurred the guilt of their blood as if it had been shed
by their hands."—The Great Controversy, pp. 627, 628.

   How is Christ's wrath manifested at the second coming of
Jesus? Rev. 6:14-17.


  "The death of Christ brings to the rejecter of His mercy the
wrath and judgments of God, unmixed with mercy. This is the
wrath of the Lamb."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 139.

   What is your view of God's wrath as it relates to His
 saving grace and love?

                                                               77

DIVINE WRATH—ITS RESULTS (Mal. 4:1-3; Rev. 14:11).
   The fate of the wicked is conclusively dealt with in the
subject of God's wrath. The common view among Christians is
that the torments of the wicked are eternal. But the third angel's
message compels us to examine this question. It is not human
traditions, but the Word of God, to which we must turn for an
authoritative answer.
  How did God destroy Sodom and Gomorrah? Gen. 19:24.
How long did this process take? Lam. 4:6. What kind of fire
destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, and of what does it serve as
an example? Jude 7.

   What remained of Sodom and Gomorrah? What remains
of the wicked after they are destroyed? Ps. 37:10, 20; Isa.
13:19, 20; Mal. 4:1, 3; 2 Peter 2:6.

   Truly the fire that destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah was
eternal, but only in effect, not in duration. The wicked will
receive their final punishment on this earth, just as did the
Sodomites. (See Prov. 11:31; Rev. 20:12-15; 21:1-5.) Following
the destruction of the impenitent, God will create "a new heaven
and a new earth" "and the former shall not be remembered,
nor come into mind" (Rev. 21:1; Isa. 65:17).
   In light of the biblical teaching that the wicked are not eter-
nally tortured, how can we understand the phrase "and the
smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever" (Rev.
14:11)?
   The phrase in the original means "to ages of ages" signify-
ing "for as long as something endures under the conditions in
which it is placed." (See Ex. 21:5, 6; Jonah 2:6.) The wicked will
be burned with unquenchable fire until they are fully con-
sumed. Nothing can stop the fire or hinder its work of utter
destruction, and nothing will remain when it has finished its
work. Even Satan and his angels will be annihilated. (See Isa.
34:9, 10; Eze. 28:14-19; Obadiah 16; Matt. 10:28.)
   Why are the worshipers of the beast and those who receive
his mark said to have no rest day or night? Rev. 14:11; 16:11;
Heb. 4:1-5; Matt. 11:28-30.

     What does today's lesson teach about God's character?
78
Thursday                                     November 24
DIVINE WRATH—ITS RESOLUTION (Rev. 16:1-21; Nahum
1:9).
   "The theory of eternal torment is one of the false doctrines
that constitute the wine of the abominations of Babylon, of
which she makes all nations drink."—The Great Controversy, p.
536. The very thought of destroying the wicked is abhorrent to
God. Even the relatively brief period of anguish to be suffered
by the lost grieves Him unutterably (Jer. 13:15-17). He calls the
administration of punitive wrath "His strange act" because
destruction is so foreign to His nature (Isa. 28:21, 22; Luke 9:56).
His preference is to "have all men to be saved" (1 Tim. 2:4).
   In spite of the heartbreaking persistence of God's love, most
people persistently reject His offer of salvation as if it were a
nuisance or an affront. The time will come when God's merci-
ful appeals will simply call forth louder scoffing, ever more
adamant rejection, and homicidal rage against God's messen-
gers of peace (Isa. 26:10; Eccl. 8:11).
  How conclusive will be the eradication of evil from the
universe? Nahum 1:9; Heb. 10:14-17.

   "The whole universe will have become witnesses to the na-
ture and results of sin. And its utter extermination, which in
the beginning would have brought fear to angels and dishonor
to God, will now vindicate His love and establish His honor
before the universe of beings who delight to do His will. . . .
Never will evil again be manifest."—The Great Controversy, p.
504.
   Because the wicked have no peace and are constantly at
work to lead others into rebellion, "it is in mercy to the uni-
verse that God will finally destroy the rejecters of His grace."
—The Great Controversy, p. 543. (See Ps. 37:12.)
   How does God's wrath manifest itself? Rev. 16:1-21.

   God does not cherish wrath, but with perfect justice metes it
out on unbelievers. When the seventh angel empties his vial,
he proclaims, "It is done" (Rev. 16:17). The plagues and the fire
of God destroy the rebellious; they do not immortalize them in
perpetual agony.
   Why is it merciful of God to relieve the wicked of their
 existence?
                                                                 79
Friday                                       November 25
FURTHER STUDY: Contrast the wrath of God with that of
Satan. Jeremiah 30:20-23; Daniel 9:26, 27; Romans 2:2-6; 11:22;
Ephesians 5:5-10; Revelation 12:17; 14:8.

   "For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain
salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, that . . . we
should live together with him" (1 Thess. 5:9, 10).
   "God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we
were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, being
now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through
him" (Rom. 5:8, 9).
   "The wrath of God will not fall upon one soul that seeks
refuge in Him."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 157.
   "The sufferings of every man are the sufferings of God's
child, and those who reach out no helping hand to their perish-
ing fellow beings provoke His righteous anger. This is the
wrath of the Lamb."—The Desire of Ages, p. 825.
 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Consider the relationship between the five following cups:
     a. Matt 26:27, 28. The communion cup presented by Christ.
     b. Matt. 26:39-42. The "cup" that Christ drank in Gethse-
        mane.
     c. Ps. 116:13; 23:5. The cup of salvation.
     d. Rev. 14:10. The cup of God's indignation.
     e. Rev. 14:8; 17:4; 18:3. The cup of Babylon's wine of
        wrathful immorality.
     2. Which is the most popular cup today? Which cup does
        Christ want us to drink from, and with what effect?
SUMMARY: God's wrath is provoked, not by human igno-
rance or weakness, but by perverse, open-eyed rebellion mani-
festing itself in cruel, hateful conduct, especially toward those
who love God and seek to obey Him. His wrath is the final
anguished expression of unrequited love for sinners who refuse
to be reconciled to Him, even in the face of Calvary love as it is
impressed upon their consciences by the Holy Spirit.

                   Hold Up the Banner
                         Ken Flemmer

    A prominent Adventist school relocated its campus when
the neighboring city grew up around it. School officials
purchased land to build a new campus, but found squatters had
settled on the land. The school offered the squatters a piece of
property and money to build new homes. A village grew up on
the new land.
    The villagers were farmers, and seasonal work did not pay
well. When they saw new buildings on their former farmland,
they decided the new owners were rich, and they began stealing
from the school. Theft got so bad that the school hired guards
to patrol the campus. Tensions between the school and the
villagers grew. How could the school hold up the banner of
God's love and protect it's valuables at the same time?
    Then ADRA sent some trainees into the village. They
talked about problems, cleaned the village, built latrines, and
provided immunizations for the children. But the village's
biggest problem was hunger. Students asked the school if the
villagers could plow an unused corner of the campus to grow
vegetables. The administration, seeing the chance to improve
relations with the villagers, agreed.
    Later, ADRA wanted to teach trainees gardening and water
development. The project leader suggested drilling a well in
the villagers' garden to help increase their growing season.
Villagers watched as the team started drilling. By late Thurs-
day they hit water. However, they couldn't finish drilling until
Sunday. Did they dare leave the portable well-driller un-
guarded in the villagers' garden—the same villagers who had
stolen supplies from the school?
    The project leader begged the school to leave the well driller
 in the garden. "Think of the negative message you will send if
you guard it," he said. When he returned Sunday, the machine
 was sitting in the garden plot, guarded by the villagers through
 the Sabbath hours.
                         A few months later, when a hurricane
                      severely damaged the school's water supply
                      and pumping station, the villagers invited
                      the faculty and students to use their water.
                         This school can hold up the banner of
                      God's love to the people in this village.

              The Latter Rain




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Hosea 6:3; Joel 2:15-32;
Zech. 10:1; Luke 11:13; James 5:7-10.
     MEMORY TEXT: "Then shall we know, if we follow on to
     know the Lord: his going forth is prepared as the morning;
     and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and
     former rain unto the earth" (Hosea 6:3).

   KEY THOUGHT: An unlimited outpouring of the Holy Spirit
will attend the final proclamation of the three angels' mes-
sages. The result will be an abundant harvest of souls ready for
translation into the kingdom of heaven.

   THE GREATEST UNUSED POWER. Two people were ob-
serving Niagara Falls when one said to the other, "This is the
greatest unused power in the world!"
   "Not so, my brother," came the reply. "The greatest unused
power in the world is the Holy Spirit of the living God." (A. J.
Gordon, adapted.)
   The Holy Spirit will usher in the latter rain—God's enabling
power for the church to give its final proclamation of the ever-
lasting gospel. The latter rain will illuminate the church with
the glory of God's character and will empower His people to
illuminate the world by bestowing upon it the necessary spir-
itual gifts and spiritual power. The latter rain ripens both the
church and the world for the final harvest in which Christ will
"reap" for His kingdom the souls seasoned in righteousness.

THE HOLY SPIRIT (John 16:7-15; Gal. 5:22-25).

   Upon what subject did Christ principally speak to His
disciples the night before His crucifixion? John 14:15-18, 26;
15:26; 16:7-15.


   The Holy Spirit is God's most powerful gift for keeping us
in contact with Christ's living presence. The Holy Spirit dwells
in us to educate, reprove, convict, regenerate, comfort, sanc-
tify, and impart spiritual gifts. He empowers us to live godly
lives and participate in the work of saving others. Christ did
not refer to the Holy Spirit as "it," but as "He." Christ taught
His disciples to baptize converts in the "name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost [Spirit]" (Matt. 28:19).
Thus, the Holy Spirit is a divine Person of the Godhead, and
not merely a celestial influence. (See also Acts 5:3, 4; 13:2.)

   How willing is God for us to receive the Holy Spirit? Luke
11:13. How essential is it that we have the Holy Spirit in our
lives? Rom. 8:1, 8-16, 26, 27.


   The book of Acts largely portrays the Spirit's work in the
early church. Consecrated believers were living vessels receiv-
ing the outpouring of the Spirit. The result was a multitude of
conversions and the defeat of evil powers. "If the fulfillment
of the promise is not seen as it might be, it is because the
promise is not appreciated as it should be. If all were willing,
all would be filled with the Spirit."—The Acts of the Apostles, p.
50. "The Holy Spirit will come to all who are begging for the
bread of life to give to their neighbors."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p.
90.

   What indispensable blessings does the Spirit bring to all
who humbly wait upon the Lord? 2 Cor. 3:17, 18; Gal. 5:17, 22-
25; 1 Peter 1:22.


  "The impartation of the Spirit is the impartation of the life of
Christ. It imbues the receiver with the attributes of Christ."
—The Desire of Ages, p. 805.

   Pray daily for the baptism of the Holy Spirit and for
 willingness to serve as He directs.

                                                               83

SHOWERS OF BLESSING AND RIPENING IN
RIGHTEOUSNESS (Acts 1:12-14; 2:1).

   "The latter rain, ripening earth's harvest, represents the spir-
itual grace that prepares the church for the coming of the Son
of man."
   "The ripening of the grain represents the completion of the
work of God's grace in the soul. By the power of the Holy Spirit
the moral image of God is to be perfected in the character. We
are to be wholly transformed into the likeness of Christ."
—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 506.

     What is essential to receiving the latter rain?

Deut. 11:13, 14

Joel 2:13,15-18, 23

Zech. 10:1

James 5:7-9

   How did the apostles prepare for the Holy Spirit? Acts 1:1-
8, 12-14; 2:1.

   1. They praised and blessed God.
   2. They met with one another to make their needs and de-
sires known to God in the name of Christ.
   3. They humbled their hearts, repented, and confessed their
doubt.
   4. They meditated upon the life of their Saviour. As they did
so, they felt that no sacrifice they would be called upon to
make on His behalf would be too great. Their chief goal was for
their lives to bear witness to Christ.
   5. They prayed for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit so they
would be able to lead sinners to Christ.
   6. They put away all differences from among themselves,
including the desire for supremacy. In drawing away from
their own selfish desires, they drew nearer to God. (See The
Acts of the Apostles, pp. 35-37.)

  "So it may be now. Let Christians put away all dissension
and give themselves to God for the saving of the lost. Let
them ask in faith for the promised blessing, and it will come."
—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 21.

SAINTS ALIVE (Acts 1:8; Isa 58:6-14).

  When we become animated by the Spirit, what activity
will take priority in our lives? Acts 1:8; 1 Thess. 1:5-8.


   Deep is the personal enrichment we receive from commun-
ion with the Holy Spirit. But that does not make us religious
hermits. Rather, we are stimulated by Christ's love, mediated
through His Spirit, to labor fervently for the salvation of
others. Filled with the Spirit, we have a compelling hunger for
the salvation of others. The life of the Spirit-filled person, though
energetic and enthusiastic, will not have a stressful, keyed-up
quality that makes others nervous or uneasy.
   "Those who are under the influence of the Spirit of God will
not be fanatical, but calm and steadfast, free from extravagance
in thought, word, or deed. Amid the confusion of delusive
doctrines, the Spirit of God will be a guide and a shield to those
who have not resisted the evidences of truth, silencing every
other voice but that which comes from Him who is the truth."
—Gospel Workers, p. 289.

   How do we communicate true, vital religion? 1 John 3:16-
18; Isa. 58:6-14.

   Our chief mission is more than warning people against the
mark of the beast and instructing them to attend church on
Sabbath. We should not teach these truths apart from Christ's
righteousness. The importance of receiving His righteousness
gives relevance and validity to every biblical message we present.
   In conjunction with teaching the three angels' messages, we
are to demonstrate God's love. This is why the Lord has in-
structed His church to engage in medical missionary evan-
gelism and in Christian help work. We are not only to teach,
but also to demonstrate the righteousness of Christ. There is
healing virtue in the three angels' messages. For a better under-
standing of these vital phases of our ministry to others, read
the chapters "Medical Missionary Work" and "Christian Help
Work" in the book Christian Service, pp. 132-140, 186-193.
   Theological teaching is ineffective unless our actions are
saturated with the love of Jesus Christ.

    Ask the Lord to show you for what services your talents
 qualify you. Then ask Him to help you utilize these talents
 in spreading the gospel message of the three angels.

                                                                  85

THE RIPENING OF THE HARVEST (2 Cor. 9:8-13).
   What is God's purpose in sowing the gospel seed? 1 Peter
1:23-25 (compare James 1:18; Isa. 60:21).

   The same word by which the Lord created the heavens and
the earth is able to regenerate us with new life from above (Isa.
55:9-13; 2 Cor. 4:6, 7).
  What kind of fruit will the regenerated life bear? Eph. 5:9;
Gal. 5:22, 23.

   Those who are united to Christ, the Living Vine, will bring
forth fruit like that of the parent stock. They have assimilated
His character by feeding on His Word and fellowshiping with
Him. Their souls are watered by His atoning mercies, flowing
from His sacrifice. They are partakers of the divine nature, and
their fruit is unto holiness. They welcome the Holy Spirit's
work in their hearts. The Spirit fulfills God's promises for
them. He makes them spiritually healthy, productive people
(Jer. 17:7, 8).
   In the physical realm, mature fruit is not brought forth
instantaneously. In what way does this same principle apply
in the spiritual realm? John 15:1-8; Mark 4:26-29.

   "As the plant takes root in the soil, so we are to take deep
root in Christ. As the plant receives the sunshine, the dew, and
the rain, we are to open our hearts to the Holy Spirit. . . . By
constantly relying upon Christ as our personal Saviour, we
shall grow up into Him in all things who is our head."
—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 67.
   As we mature in grace and godliness, what does the Lord
increasingly supply? 2 Cor. 9:8-13; Ps. 126:5, 6.

   "The object of the Christian life is fruit bearing—the repro-
duction of Christ's character in the believer, that it may be
reproduced in others."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 67.
   What can you do to hasten your growth and Christ's
return?

INTERNATIONAL HARVESTERS (Isa. 61:10, 11).
   How does Jesus describe our part in spreading the gospel?
Mark 4:1-8, 14-20. What are we to do about the great harvest
that awaits us? Luke 10:2-11.

   "With the great truth we have been privileged to receive, we
should, and under the Holy Spirit's power we could become
living channels of light. We could then approach the mercy
seat; and seeing the bow of promise, kneel with contrite hearts,
and seek the kingdom of heaven with a spiritual violence that
would bring its own reward. . . . When this experience is
ours, . . . we shall empty our hearts of the corroding power of
selfishness, and shall be filled with praise and gratitude to
God. We shall magnify the Lord, the God of all grace, who has
magnified Christ. And He will reveal His power through us,
making us as sharp sickles in the harvest field."—Ellen G.
White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1089.
   As we return to primitive godliness, and are visited with
the latter rain, what will be the results? Isa. 61:10, 11; 62:10-12;
Joel 2:23, 24.

  The third angel's message "is represented as being given
with a loud voice; that is, with power of the Holy Spirit."
—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 980.
   "They will declare the truth with the might of the Spirit's
power. Multitudes will receive the faith and join the armies of
the Lord."—Evangelism, p. 700.

   How will Satan try to counterfeit the latter rain? Rev. 13:11-
14 (compare 13:3; 12:9); Matt. 24:24; 2 Thess. 2:3, 8-12. What
will be the main difference between this false revival and the
true? Deut. 32:1-5.

   The most cunningly devised miracles will not deceive those
who receive the truth that they might be saved. Whatever does
not conform with God's law and the testimony they will recog-
nize as false and reject accordingly.
    What evidence is there that Satan has begun to counter-
 feit the outpouring of the Holy Spirit?

                                                                 87
Friday                                         December 2
FURTHER STUDY: The latter rain is vital to true revival. Satan
seeks to thwart revival largely by redirecting it along his coun-
terfeit lines. Read the chapter "Modern Revivals" in The Great
Controversy, pp. 461-478, and carefully distinguish between the
characteristics of true and false revival. Compare Romans 8:1-
17 and 2 Peter 2.
   "When we have entire, wholehearted consecration to the
service of Christ, God will recognize the fact by an outpouring
of His Spirit without measure; but this will not be while the
largest portion of the church are not laborers together with
God."—Evangelism, p. 699.
   "The outpouring of the Spirit in the days of the apostles was
the former rain, and glorious was the result. But the latter rain
will be much more abundant."—Evangelism, p. 701.
   "The Spirit is poured out upon all who will yield to its
promptings, and, casting off all man's machinery, his binding
rules and cautious methods, they will declare the truth with
the Spirit's power. Multitudes will receive the faith and join the
armies of the Lord."—Evangelism, p. 700.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What effect will our heeding the counsel of the true
     Witness to the Laodicean church have upon our lives
     and witness? Read Rev. 3:14-21.
     2. What criteria did Christ give us by which to evaluate our
        religious experience before the end of the harvest, when
        it will be too late to change character? Matt. 7:15-27.
     3. Is it safe to wait passively for the Lord to stir us into
        action? Do we have any responsibility in preparing for
        the latter rain? If so, what is that responsibility?
SUMMARY: Through His Holy Spirit, God empowers His
church to proclaim the gospel message of the three angels to a
spiritually starved world. The truth, spoken with unprecedented
power by those who honor it in their lives, will ripen the
harvest of believers. Then Christ will return and reap into His
kingdom all who have chosen Him. Scripture refers to the final
outpouring of the Holy Spirit as the latter rain. All will receive
the latter rain who continually consecrate themselves entirely
to God and His service.

            Showers of Blessing in Romania
                         James H. Zachary

   God works wonders with very little. With only six active
Adventists attending the house church in Caracal, Romania, evan-
gelism seemed hopeless. But God specializes in tough situations.
   The district pastor conducted a Revelation Seminar that drew 70
persons. A local religious leader, determined to disrupt the seminar,
attended the meeting and tried to embarrass the pastor. Then one
day two clerics arrived in their official robes and censors, to "exor-
cise" the Adventist "devils" from the city. Still the people came.
    In preparation for the evangelistic meetings that followed the
Revelation Seminar, members of the baptismal class joined the six
church members to pass out handbills, visit interests, and help
remodel the house church.
    Adrienne was one of the new believers. Her parents resisted her
interest in the Bible. Often she came to the meetings with wounds
inflicted by her angry father. Once she escaped the beating. When
her father tried to drag her into the wood shed, Adrienne grabbed
onto a water pipe. Her father pulled her so hard that the pipe broke.
In the shower that followed, he forgot the beating.
    Adrienne was determined to be baptized. The night before the
baptism she stayed in the pastor's home so her father could not
prevent her from being baptized.
    With a joyful smile on her face Adrienne was baptized in the new
baptismal tank in the living room of the house church. She started
for home knowing what awaited her there. But her grandmother
was visiting, and when she saw Adrienne, she asked, "Where have
you been so long?"
    "Oh grandmother, something wonderful happened tonight. I
was baptized just the way Jesus was baptized." She prepared herself
for a violent reaction.
    "Why didn't you tell me? I would like to be baptized that way
too," Grandmother replied. Adrienne's parents listened in surprised
silence. There was no beating that night.
    Now the little house church is full of new members who are
                       helping to plant churches in surrounding ar-
                       eas. God is doing great things in Romania. In
                       15 months more than 13,470 persons joined
                       the church, as laypersons and pastors work
  In together in evangelism.


                         James H. Zachary is associate secretary in
                      the Ministerial Association.

              The Loud Cry




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Rev. 18:1-5; John 10:16;
Isa. 60:1-5.
  MEMORY TEXT: "And after these things I saw another
  angel come down from heaven, having great power; and
  the earth was lightened with his glory" (Revelation 18:1).
   KEY THOUGHT: The loud cry of the third angel's message
illuminates the earth with the revelation of God's glorious
character. Its purpose is twofold: (1) to liberate all who are
willing from the deceptions of Satan; (2) to gather those liber-
ated into God's remnant church.
   THE LOUD CRY IS GOD'S LAST WARNING AND AP-
PEAL to a world locked in the fierce grip of sin. As a result of
the final outpouring of the Holy Spirit, God's remnant people
will utter the loud cry of the third angel with majesty, purity,
and penetrating power. Though given by a despised remnant,
this message will recommend itself clearly to the honest-hearted
as being holy in origin and purpose. Indeed, it is Heaven's last
appeal to a world wrapped in the chill, poisonous fog of
Babylonish dogmas and lying wonders.
   "The work of this angel [Rev. 18:1] comes in at the right time
to join in the last great work of the third angel's message as it
swells to a loud cry. And the people of God are thus prepared
to stand in the hour of temptation, which they are soon to
meet. I saw a great light resting upon them, and they united to
fearlessly proclaim the third angel's message."—Early Writ-
ings, p. 277.

COME OUT OF BABYLON (Isa. 48:20; 60:1-5).
   During World War II, many women worked in a German
munitions factory. They slept together in a barracks on the
factory compound. One night the munitions plant was sabo-
taged. Huge, concussive explosions filled the air and shook the
ground. The workers took refuge in a shallow underground
shelter, where they huddled in terror. As the work of destruc-
tion progressed, the shelter began to crack and crumble. Sud-
denly a military officer burst in and thundered, "Get out! Get
out!" The women escaped the shelter just before it collapsed,
by running to safety through a scene of fiery destruction.
   In the last days, while people take vain refuge in the bosom
of Babylon, God cries out through the message of the three
angels, "Come out of her, my people" (Rev. 18:4). "Arise ye,
and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is polluted, it
shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction" (Micah 2:10).
The loud cry is His last appeal and warning. (Read The Great
Controversy, pp. 604, 605.) How important that all who love the
Lord join with Him in giving the loud cry to a doomed world!
   To whom in Babylon does God address this appeal? How
should they come out of Babylon? Rev. 18:1, 4; 2 Cor. 6:16-18
(compare Isa. 48:20; 52:11).

   "Almost till the very close of time, apparently, some—per-
haps many—of God's people have not heard the call to come
out of mystical Babylon. Compare God's call to His people in
ancient times to flee from literal Babylon. . . . Presumably, all
who are truly His people will hear His voice and heed His
call."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 861.
  What connection exists between the angel's lighting the
earth with glory and his solemn message of denunciation and
warning? Rev. 18:1-5; Hab. 2:12-15; Isa. 60:1-5.

   It is a glorious mission to turn people from false religion to
the genuine religion of Christ. While at first glance the empha-
sis of the message seems to be Babylon's corruption and doom,
the essential theme is this: Flee Babylon, and find shelter in
Christ and His fold.

   What can you do to help someone find shelter in Christ?

                                                               91

INTO CHRIST'S FOLD (Rev. 12:17; 19:10).

   What will be the character of God's true church at the end
of time? Eph. 5:25-27.

  What has God resolved to do for and through His church?
Eph. 3:10, 14-21; Rev. 12:1.

   Human wisdom may console itself in unbelief. But God will
have a visible body of faithful, purified believers. They will
breast the raging waves of apostasy and prove an impregnable
bulwark against Satan's onslaughts and seductions.
   God established the Christian church at Pentecost through
the work of His Holy Spirit in the lives of Christ's followers. So
has He kept the church alive through the ages. And so will He
bring it to victory in the end. No human or satanic agency will
be able to destroy it.
   The call to become part of God's remnant church is not the
theological aberration of a boastful sect. It is an integral com-
ponent of the three angels' messages, issued by God Himself.
(Read Joel 2:32; Zech. 8:6, 7; John 10:16.)
  What are the definitive characteristics of God's remnant?
Rev. 12:17; 14:12.

   An examination of the remnant's features discloses their
identifying characteristics: (1) patience; (2) obedience to God's
commandments; (3) faith; (4) possession of the testimony of
Jesus. Their patient endurance and obedience to God's will
result from their faith in Christ.
    How many denominations or churches adhere to all ten of
God's commandments, including the seventh-day Sabbath?
How many honor the testimony of Jesus, which is the Spirit of
Prophecy? (Rev. 19:10; Isa. 8:20). In its largest sense, the Spirit
of Prophecy represents a clear grasp of God's prophetic word
(Dan. 12:1-10; Rev. 1:3). More specifically, it means a revival of
the gift of prophecy. Seventh-day Adventists believe God espe-
cially bestowed this gift upon Ellen White for the spiritual
guidance of the remnant church. Her rich body of writings on
practical Christian living harmonizes throughout with Scrip-
ture.

THE ULTIMATE FALL OF BABYLON (Rev. 18:5-8).

  What is the spiritual condition of Babylon at the time of
the loud cry of the third angel? Rev. 18:5-8.


   In the King James Version, we read that Babylon's sins
"reached" to heaven. The Greek word translated "reach" means
"to glue together," "to fasten firmly together." Babylon's trans-
gressions are, therefore, depicted "as a mountainous mass reach-
ing upward, compact and glued together."—SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 7, p. 861.
   Because of Babylon's spiritual condition, we read that its
destruction will come "in one day" (Rev. 18:8) or "one hour"
(verse 10). The Greek suggests a point of time as opposed to a
specific time period. Thus the phrases "one day" or "one hour"
seem to stress suddenness and surprise rather than duration.
   "In the eighteenth chapter of Revelation the people of God
are called upon to come out of Babylon. According to this
scripture, many of God's people must still be in Babylon. And
in what religious bodies are the greater part of the followers of
Christ now to be found? Without doubt, in the various churches
professing the Protestant faith."
    "Notwithstanding the spiritual darkness and alienation from
God that exist in the churches which constitute Babylon, the
great body of Christ's true followers are still to be found in
their communion."—The Great Controversy, pp. 383, 390.
    We must remember that among Muslims, Shintoists, Bud-
dhists, Hindus, humanists, animists, Christians of various de-
nominations, and people of every other sort of religion and
ideology, many have been faithfully responding to the influ-
ences of the Holy Spirit. These honest seekers for truth will
come out of their systems of error and join God's remnant
church (Rom. 8:14; John 1:9; Isa. 60:5-11). The three angels'
 messages are to go to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.
 Multitudes will come out of Babylon to join the remnant church.
 They will make Christ their reliance and receive total cleansing
 from sin. (See Early Writings, p. 271.)

   What can you do in your life and witness to help people
 come out of Babylon? Have you come out fully yourself?




                                                              93
Wednesday                                       December 7
BABYLON'S PERSECUTION OF THE REMNANT (Rev. 17:4-
6).
   Scripture clearly states that "he that loveth not knoweth not
God; for God is love" (1 John 4:8). For all its wealth, wonders,
pomp, miracles, and glittering pretensions, Babylon exhibits a
spirit of intolerance toward those who live the truth as it is in
Jesus (Rev. 17:4-6; 18:24). The real irony is that Babylon exhibits
this spirit in God's name. But whatever their former beliefs,
God's true people in Babylon will recognize that the persecut-
ing spirit is wrong. This will alert them to the necessity of
leaving Babylon. At the same time, God's true servants who
are proclaiming the three angels' messages will receive the
latter rain, giving credibility to their message. (See The Great
Controversy, p. 611.)
  How do the prophets describe the spirit and work of the
remnant? Rev. 14:1-5 (compare Dan. 12:3; 2 Cor. 6:1-10).

   God's people will not be absorbed in saving themselves
from persecution. They will conduct their work judiciously but
courageously, as Christ has taught His servants to do (Matt.
10:16-28; Acts 8:1-4; 11:19-21).
   "When the storm of persecution really breaks upon us, the
true sheep will hear the true Shepherd's voice. Self-denying
efforts will be put forth to save the lost, and many who have
strayed from the fold will come back to follow the great Shep-
herd. The people of God will draw together and present to the
enemy a united front. In view of the common peril, strife for
supremacy will cease; there will be no disputing as to who
shall be accounted the greatest. . . .
   "Thus will the truth be brought into practical life, and thus
will be answered the prayer of Christ. . . . 'That they may all be
one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may
be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent
me.' John 17:21. The love of Christ, the love of our brethren,
will testify to the world that we have been with Jesus and have
learned of Him. Then will the message of the third angel swell
to a loud cry, and the whole earth will be lightened with the
glory of the Lord."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 401.
  Before intense persecution breaks forth, what can you or
your class do to lighten the earth with God's glory? Is there
danger that intolerance or unkindness in your heart will
drive the Holy Spirit away from you?

ZION'S TRIUMPH IN CHRIST (Rom. 3:20-24, 31).
   The loud cry of the third angel's message comprises more
than the proclamation of Babylon's fall. It heralds the glad
tidings of Christ's pure gospel high above the whirlpool of
human tradition and the doctrines of demons. At the same
time, it brings the truth within soul-saving reach of all who
desire freedom from bondage to Satan.
   "The loud cry of the third angel has already begun in the
revelation of the righteousness of Christ, the sin-pardoning
Redeemer. This is the beginning of the light of the angel whose
glory shall fill the whole earth."—Selected Messages, book 1, p.
363.
   What does the Scripture teach concerning the believers'
relationship to the righteousness of Christ? Rom. 3:20-24, 31
(compare 2 Cor. 5:21; Phil. 3:7-10; 1 Peter 2:24).

   Through His gospel of grace, Christ has made ample provi-
sion for us to become filled with His righteousness and par-
takers of His divine nature. This is the mystery of God: "Christ
in you, the hope of glory" (Col. 1:27-29). On the other hand, the
mystery of iniquity is the presence of Satan in the human heart,
making it impenetrable to the love of God.
   Tragically, most people in the world and many in the church
will rise up against this message because they have alienated
themselves from their Saviour. The proclamation of pure truth,
exalting Christ and His righteousness, will cause a shaking in
the world and in the church. Satan will stir up the combined
powers of apostasy to eradicate God's commandment-keeping
people from the earth. The result will be that "a great propor-
tion of those who are supposed to be genuine will give heed to
seducing spirits, and will . . . betray sacred trusts. They will
prove our very worst persecutors."—Ellen G. White Comments,
SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1065.
   While the shaking of God blows away multitudes like dry
leaves, "the ranks will not be diminished. Those who are firm
and true will close up the vacancies that are made by those
who become offended and apostatize."—Selected Messages, book
3, p. 422; see also Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 81.
    Read Luke 21:34-36 and pray for God's grace to make you
 a steadfast witness for Him during the shaking time.

FURTHER STUDY: Read Acts 20:18-36. Look for the elements
in Paul's character that would help you remain strong in the
Lord during the church's hour of supreme trial. Read the chap-
ter entitled "The Final Warning" in The Great Controversy, pp.
603-612.
   The devil seeks to persuade us that the best way to maintain
loyalty to God is to conform to worldly standards of belief and
behavior. But consider the following statements:
    "The church may appear as about to fall, but it does not fall.
It remains, while the sinners in Zion will be sifted out—the
chaff separated from the precious wheat. This is a terrible
ordeal, but nevertheless it must take place."—Selected Messages,
book 2, p. 380.
   "I know that the Lord loves His church. It is not to be
disorganized or broken up into independent atoms. . . . Those
who shall heed this false message and try to leaven others will
be deceived and prepared to receive advanced delusions, and
they will come to nought."—Selected Messages, book 2, pp. 68,
69.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS: Read the statement below. Then
answer the question following:
    "During the loud cry, the church, aided by the providen-
tial interpositions of her exalted Lord, will diffuse the knowl-
edge of salvation so abundantly that light will be communi-
cated to every city and town. The earth will be filled with the
knowledge of salvation. So abundantly will the renewing
Spirit of God have crowned with success the intensely active
agencies, that the light of present truth will be seen flashing
every-where. . . .
   "Men will be called [from their earthly occupations] . . .
and will be educated in connection with men of experience.
As they learn to labor effectively, they will proclaim the truth
with power. . . . Onward, and still onward the work will
advance, until the whole earth shall have been warned. And
then shall the end come."—Maranatha, p. 218.
  What do you think will be some of the "providential inter-
positions" that will give impetus to the three angels' mes-
sages? Are we seeing any of these interpositions today?
SUMMARY: Through the loud cry of the third angel's mes-
sage, God will bind off the harvest of the earth, gathering the
honest-hearted out of every nation and tribe to become eternal
citizens of His kingdom.

                       My Testimony
                        Mary Abraham*

   I am a young Muslim woman in Turkey where I work as a
tour guide. Three years ago I met one tour group that changed
my life forever.
   The group leader requested that we change their scheduled
tour for Saturday; they wanted to go to church instead! They
must be Jewish, I thought. The leader gave me the church
address, and on Saturday morning I showed them to the church.
   Curious, I asked whether I could stay and watch. The group
leader preached, and I translated his sermon for the Turkish
people there.
   The next day while touring, another tour member read from
the big Book he carried about prophecies concerning the seven
churches of Asia Minor. I began to understand that God had
sent this group from South Africa to help me understand the
truth of Christianity.
   I asked many questions, and they were so patient with me.
But their five-day tour was too short. I cried when they left. I
had been reared Muslim, and had been told stories of the
cruelty of Christians, but now I saw a faith full of the love of
God.
   I began to read the Bible, the Quran (Koran), and books my
new friends left me. I was confused and lonely. When 'my
friends invited me to visit them I was so happy! I wanted to
learn more about their faith. For 23 days we talked, prayed,
went to church, and studied the Bible. Everything began to fall
into place. I had finally found the truth!
   The day before my departure, a voice inside me asked,
"What are you waiting for?" I had found the truth I was
searching for. With great joy I was baptized and became a part
of the Seventh-day Adventist people!
   Now I study and learn more about God. I translate into
 Turkish the books my friends gave me, and I share what I know
 with my countrymen. It is not an easy life, but God holds my
 hand, shows me the way, and puts the right words in my mouth.

   Mary Abraham (not her real name), is currently studying at an
Adventist college under sponsorship of Middle East Union. One-to-
one evangelism changed Mary's life. It can change someone else's if
you will be the evangelist.

Lesson 12                                  December 11-17

           Faith Triumphant




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Rev. 14:12; 1 John 5:2-5;
Heb. 11:32-40; Luke 18:1-8.
     MEMORY TEXT: "Here is the patience of the saints: here
     are they that keep the commandments of God, and the
     faith of Jesus" (Revelation 14:12).

   KEY THOUGHT: The true faith of Jesus is the power by
which we can triumph over all evil and reveal His character in
all places at all times, including the world's last desperate days
of ultimate apostasy. Faith is the faculty with which God en-
dows us so we can live joyously and valiantly by every word
that proceeds from His mouth.
   THE CLIMAX OF THE THREE ANGELS' MESSAGES.
Revelation 14:12 summarizes the experience that the three an-
gels' messages are intended to produce in the life of every
hearer. In our study of these messages we have considered the
age-old struggle between the forces of good and evil. Satan's
constant goal is to lead us away from God by inducing us to
abandon our faith in Jesus and our commitment to His law. As
we have seen, the everlasting gospel is designed to restore in
us the image of our Creator and Redeemer. This experience is
available through the faith that Christ Himself supplies to
every willing heart, a faith that opens the channel of grace by
which we receive the ability to obey.

THE COMMANDMENTS OF GOD AND THE FAITH OF
JESUS (Heb. 11:31-38).

   The order of ideas in Revelation 14:12 is revealing. This
verse points to the experience and character of God's true
people who are prepared to enter His kingdom.
   1."Here is the patience of the saints." The word for patience in
the original connotes "cheerful endurance," "fortitude," "pa-
tient perseverance." The Lord is pointing to the steadfast, ac-
tive, tenacious connection His people have with Him, particu-
larly in the midst of earth's supreme crisis. Their religious
experience is not the stuff of myths and dreams. It is rooted in
eternal truths and supported by the power of God's love for
them and in them.
   2. "Here are they that keep the commandments of God." Human
logic would suggest that the saints' possession of the faith of
Jesus should be mentioned first, because without that faith
they could not obey His commandments. But the Lord is here
presenting His people as an exhibit of the power of His salva-
tion. In the manner of a legal testimony He presents first the
evidence and then the cause for its being. The saints' posses-
sion of the true faith of Jesus is indisputably demonstrated by
their obedience to God's law.
   3. "And the faith of Jesus." The saints have faith in Jesus and
the faith of Jesus; that is, the faith that He exercised in His
earthly life to overcome the power of Satan. Christ supplies
this faith to every willing believer (Heb. 12:1-3).
  What does the faith of Jesus enable God's people to do and
endure? Heb. 11:33-38.

   True faith is an enduring fabric that time cannot unravel nor
trials rend nor temptations stain. "A living faith means an
increase of vigor, a confiding trust, by which the soul becomes
a conquering power. He who drinks of the water of life which
Jesus gives, possesses within himself a well of water springing
up into everlasting life. Though it shall be cut off from all
created springs, it is fed from the hidden fountain. It is a
perpetual spring, in immediate communication with the inex-
haustible fountain of life."—That I May Know Him, p. 227 (read
also p. 226).
    Read Christ's parable of the persistent widow in Luke
18:1-8, and contemplate His concluding question. What does
 this question imply? What warning do you take from it?

                                                                99
Monday                                      December 12
THIS IS THE VICTORY (1 John 5:2-5; 2 Cor. 9:8-11).
  What is the divinely ordained means of obtaining victory
over sin? 1 John 5:2-5; Rev. 12:11.

   Faith is not a magic charm. It is the divinely supplied power
that enables people to believe and appropriate every promise
and provision that God offers them. This is why people of faith
overcome Satan by the blood of the Lamb. That blood has
cleansed them of their sins to the inmost depths of their being
(Rev. 7:14). They also overcome by the word of their testimony,
because their testimony expresses their abiding faith in Him
and His Word (1 Peter 4:11). They love not their lives unto the
death, because Jesus died on their behalf that they might live
eternally. They praise Him, even in affliction.
   A Christian stood trial before Diocletian, a cruel emperor of
Rome. The emperor demanded that he renounce his faith. The
Christian refused. In a rage, the emperor thundered, "Abjure
your faith, or I will banish you from my realm."
   The Christian replied, "That, sire, you may do, but you can
never banish me from Christ; for He will never leave me nor
forsake me."
   "Then I will confiscate your property," Diocletian shot back.
   "Oh, sire, that you may not do, for my property is laid up in
heaven, beyond the reach of mortal hand."
   The emperor furiously retorted, "Then I will kill you!"
   With perfect serenity the Christian replied, "This body you
may kill; but I am already dead to this world, and my life is hid
with Christ in God. When Christ, who is my life, shall appear,
then shall I also appear with Him in glory."
  How can our faith be increased? Luke 17:5, 6; 2 Cor. 9:8-11.

   "The more our faith fastens to Christ in perfect trust, the
more peace we shall have. Faith will grow by exercise."—That I
May Know Him, p. 231.
   "In order to strengthen faith, we must often bring it in con-
tact with the word."—Education, p. 254.
  Think of five Bible heroes and heroines of faith. List
how they obtained their strength and faith.

Tuesday                                      December 13
FAITH VERSUS LEGALISM (Rom. 3:20-22).

   What great error did Paul strive to refute? Rom. 3:20-22
(compare Gal. 2:15, 16, 21; 5:4-6; Titus 3:4-7).

   Paul was as emphatic as human language enabled him to be:
We are not saved by the law. We are not saved by praise-
worthy deeds. We are saved by the merits of Christ alone. His
sacrifice provides pardon and reconciling grace. "There is not
a point that needs to be dwelt upon more earnestly, repeated
more frequently, or established more firmly in the minds of all
than the impossibility of fallen man meriting anything by his
own best good works. Salvation is through faith in Jesus Christ
alone."—Faith and Works, p. 19. (Read also Rom. 3:28; 4:3, 4,11-
14.)
   What is the great landmark truth that gave rise to the
Reformation and has been at the heart of every true revival in
all ages? Hab. 2:4 (compare Rom. 1:16, 17; Gal. 3:11; Heb.
10:38).

   This truth shatters the Babylonish tower of self-generated
works that have no capacity to bring us near to God, no justify-
ing value, and no sanctifying properties. Instead, they are only
a deadly obstacle to salvation (John 6:27-29, 37, 40).
   How does Paul describe the life of those justified in Christ?
1 Cor. 6:9-11; Gal. 2:17, 20.

   "The forgiveness of sins is not the sole result of the death of
Jesus. He made the infinite sacrifice, not only that sin might be
removed, but that human nature might be restored, rebeautified,
reconstructed from its ruins, and made fit for the presence of
God."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 537. (Compare The Desire of Ages,
p. 172.)
   Plan to study the book of Romans, which gives the most
 systematic presentation in all Scripture on the subject of
 justification and sanctification. Resolve by God's grace to
 master this subject and to know the joy of full pardon and
 regeneration in Christ. What relationship do you see be-
 tween Paul's presentation of salvation and Christ's mes-
 sage to Nicodemus? (John 3).
                                                              101
Wednesday                                     December 14
FAITH VERSUS PRESUMPTION (Matt. 7:21-23).
   What are some of the characteristics and results of true
faith?
Gal. 5:6
Rom. 3:31
Rom. 5:1
Phil. 3:8-14
   "There is nothing in faith that makes it our saviour. Faith
cannot remove our guilt. Christ is the power of God unto
salvation to all them that believe. . . . He has paid the price for
the sinner's redemption. Yet it is only through faith in His
blood that Jesus can justify the believer."—The Faith I Live By,
p. 107.
   In the day of final accounts, what class of professed be-
lievers will find themselves ineligible for entrance into the
kingdom of God? Matt. 7:21-23, 26, 27.

   The word translated "iniquity" (Matt. 7:23, KJV) is lawless-
ness in the original. The measure of true faith and love in the
sight of God is obedience to the Ten Commandments. The
religious faith that falls short of this is false, delusionary, and
bankrupt.
   "Faith is in no sense allied to presumption. Only he who has
true faith is secure against presumption. For presumption is
Satan's counterfeit of faith. Faith claims God's promises, and
brings forth fruit in obedience. Presumption also claims the
promises, but uses them as Satan did, to excuse transgres-
sion."—The Desire of Ages, p. 126.
  How can we tell when faith is not genuine? James 2:14-20.

   What good is a faith that does not express itself in loving
deeds? Faith is our response to God's desire to live in us through
the atoning merits of Christ. God is active (John 5:17). And He
arouses His children to similar activity (Titus 3:7, 8).
  How can I safeguard my soul against presumption?

102
Thursday                                      December 15
FAITH THAT WORKS (2 Thess. 1:11, 12).

   What is the practical result of all true faith? Gal. 5:6; Phil.
2:12, 13.


   We may be lured into thinking that we must add works in
order for faith to produce results. But this is not how Scripture
presents the subject. True faith, which Christ supplies, is an
animating principle that energizes us to live in harmony with
His will. Genuine faith works. It is not propped up by works.
   "He who is trying to reach heaven by his own works in
keeping the law, is attempting an impossibility. Man cannot be
saved without obedience, but his works should not be of him-
self; Christ should work in him to will and to do of His good
pleasure."—Selected Messages, book 1, p. 364.
    "Many in the Christian world . . . claim that all that is
necessary to salvation is to have faith; works are nothing, faith
is the only essential. But God's Word tells us that faith without
works is dead, being alone. . . . Faith and works go hand in
hand. . . . Works will never save us; it is the merit of Christ that
will avail in our behalf."—That I May Know Him, p. 229.

   What is the ultimate purpose of faith? 2 Thess. 1:11, 12.


   The first angel's message calls upon us to "give glory" to
God. We do this by giving Him full dominion of our lives. He
comes into our hearts, not as a cruel dictator, but as a benevo-
lent Lord, doing for us nothing but good on the highest plane.
He dwells in our hearts through faith, filling us with love and
grace for loving and gracious purposes. He wishes us to dis-
play the power and availability of His salvation to the ends of
the earth (Eph. 3:17-21; Matt. 24:14).

   How may everyone receive saving faith? Eph. 2:8. What is
the result? Eph. 2:9, 10.


   God withholds nothing from us that would secure our salva-
tion. Let us joyfully accept the gift of His saving faith and let it
be the stimulus to holy living.




                                                                103
Friday                                      December 16
FURTHER STUDY: As you read Colossians 1:21-23; 1 Timothy
6:7-15; Revelation 2:10, 13; 17:14, consider the vital connection
between having faith in God and weathering the storms, tests,
temptations, and trials of life. Then consider anew the relation-
ship between God's faithfulness and our possession of faith.
See Revelation 1:5; 19:11; 21:5; 22:6.
   Also read "Living Faith," in Messages to Young People, pp.
111-116.

   At Sinai, just before the declaration of the commandments,
the trumpet of God blew and "waxed louder and louder" (Ex.
19:19). So it is with the three angels' messages. Their content
and appeal become increasingly urgent and intense, accompa-
nied by the strains of entreating love.
   In effect, the third angel's message is God's plea to all hu-
manity, "How can I give you up? How can I let you go? Come
out of Babylon, which wars against My covenant of peace and
truth. Come into My fold, which keeps My commandments
and the faith of Jesus. Repent, and turn yourselves from all
your transgressions, so iniquity shall not be your ruin. My
grace reigns through righteousness and is sufficient for you to
be more than conqueror over all your sin and the power of the
enemy. This victory is possible through My Son, who beckons
you now in these final hours of probation." God's trumpet call
ends on a joyous, triumphant note: "Here is the patience of the
saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and
the faith of Jesus" (Rev. 14:12). Thus in one summary state-
ment, God vindicates His system of truth and His people.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. By what means can you experience a steady and constant
     growth in faith?

  2. Why are faith and obedience so closely linked?

  3. Why are we justified by faith (Rom. 3:28; 5:1; Gal. 3:24)
     and judged by our works? (Matt. 16:27; 1 Peter 1:17; Rev.
     22:11, 12). Do we as a people need to experience more
     faith or more obedience?

SUMMARY: The fruit of the three angels' messages is to bring
forth a people from every nation, kindred, tongue, and people
who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.
This faith enables them to appropriate every blessing of the
gospel and thereby have victory over sin.

EWAN AUssissa                Touched by a Song
    ViSIF                         Adly Campos

            The telephone rang. "Hello," I answered. On the other end
         was a pastor. He wanted me to help minister to more than 3,000
         Cuban refugees.
            After a brief conversation I agreed to assist in a short series
         of evangelistic meetings to reach those who, for more than 20
         years, had not been able to learn about Jesus.
            During the week of meetings I counseled privately with men
         and women who hungered for the Word of God. I listened to
         stories that touched my life and helped me to understand the
         oppression under which these people had lived. They had been
         deprived of liberty of conscience and freedom to worship God.
            When I left Florida at the end of the week's meetings, more
         than 200 persons had found the Lord. During the ensuing
         months, the Cuban refugees left Fort Chaffey, and settled in
         homes in different areas of the country.
            Some time later on a warm summer night I sang in a church
         in Miami for a series of evangelistic meetings. Outside a car
         stopped right in front of the church. A young man climbed out,
         stepped into the church, walked down the aisle, and stared
         straight at me. I felt uncomfortable. Then, as I continued to
         sing, he made his way to the first row and sat down.
            At the end of the meeting, the young man approached me
         and said, "Adly, as I drove by the front of the church, I heard
         singing and recognized your voice. I am so glad to find you
         again! Your message in song has touched my heart. I first
         heard you sing at meetings in Fort Chaffey when I first came
         from Cuba! I have been looking in the music stores for your
         cassette, but I could not find it. Where can I buy it?"
            From that day on, he attended all the meetings. Today, he is
         a baptized member in the church. I give all the glory to God,
         who led this young man to Christ because of a song!

      Earth's Final Harvest




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 13:36-43; Rev. 14:12-
20; 15:2-4; 17:14-18; 19:1-21.

  MEMORY TEXT: "And I looked, and behold a white cloud,
  and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man,
  having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp
  sickle" (Revelation 14:14).
   KEY THOUGHT: When God, through the three angels' mes-
sages, has done His work, Christ will return in glory to vindi-
cate His truth and deliver His people.
   CHRIST'S RETURN WILL CONSUMMATE THE GOS-
PEL, fulfill the hope of the saints, and end forever Satan's evil
reign. Prior to this, the earth will undergo a time of trouble
during which Babylon's system of apostasy and rebellion will
collapse. Closing events will expose the character of the wicked
and manifest the sincerity and sustaining power of the saints'
faith. God will protect from the final plagues those who love
Him, and He will translate them to heaven.
   Since its beginning, the church has looked to Christ's return
as the glorious hope. This promise has been a mainstay of the
church's mission, a support in all its trials, and a guarantee of
the resolution of the great controversy between good and evil.
In the near future the three angels' messages, under the Spirit's
blessing, shall accomplish their purpose of ripening the earth's
harvest for our Lord's return. For the strength and guidance of
the church, Christ has outlined closing events in His prophetic
word so that we may stand fast in the faith through the power
of His love.

THE KING IS COMING (John 14:1-3).
   For centuries, philosophers have contemplated life's pur-
pose—its final goal, its ultimate conclusions. Scripture is clear—
history is not heading toward endless cycles of suffering, struggle,
short triumphs, and lasting defeats, but toward a universal
reign of everlasting righteousness, eternal life, and boundless
joy.
   How will that seemingly unimaginable hope be accom-
plished? John 14:1-3 (compare Rom. 8:18-25; Heb. 10:34-39).

   "An understanding of the hope of Christ's second coming is
the key that unlocks all the history that follows, and explains
all the future lessons. . . . We are pilgrims and strangers who
are waiting, hoping, and praying for that blessed hope, the
glorious appearing of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. If we
believe this and bring it into our practical life, what vigorous
action would this faith and hope inspire; what fervent love for
one another; what careful holy living for the glory of God; and
in our respect for the recompense of the reward, what distinct
lines of demarcation would be evidenced between us and the
world."—Evangelism, p. 220.
   Before Jesus comes, what will earth be like as the powers
of evil conspire? Dan. 12:1 (compare Matt. 24:9-22; 2 Thess.
2:1-7).

   We have seen escalating turmoil and rapid changes in world
events, all of which are rushing us toward the final scenes of
prophecy. Truly we are on the verge of a stupendous crisis,
"which, more than any previous time since the world began,
will demand the entire consecration of every one who has
named the name of Christ."—Gospel Workers, p. 323. "A storm
is arising that will wrench and test the spiritual foundation of
every one to the utmost." "Instead of becoming weak and
irresolute, the people of God should be gathering strength and
courage for the time of trouble."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 129;
vol. 4, p. 251.
   Ponder and heed the counsel in Malachi 3:1-7. Why is it
 not in our best interests to prepare for the end of the world
 by stockpiling food and other physical necessities?

                                                                 107

BABYLON'S LAST STAND (2 Thess. 2:3, 4; Rev. 13:8).
   What will be the final delusion that will bring all the
world to its ultimate test of loyalty? 2 Thess. 2:3, 4. How can
we guard against surrendering to the wrong spiritual author-
ity? 2 John 6-11; Rev. 3:10, 11.

   "Antichrist is to perform his marvelous works in our sight.
So closely will the counterfeit resemble the true that it will be
impossible to distinguish between them except by the Holy
Scriptures."—The Great Controversy, p. 593.
   "As the crowning act in the great drama of deception, Satan
himself will personate Christ. . . . In different parts of the earth,
Satan will manifest himself among men as a majestic being of
dazzling brightness, resembling the description of the Son of
God given by John in the Revelation. Revelation 1:13-15. The
glory that surrounds him is unsurpassed by anything that mor-
tal eyes have yet beheld. The shout of triumph rings out . . .
'Christ has come! Christ has come!' The people prostrate them-
selves in adoration before him, while he lifts up his hands and
pronounces a blessing upon them. . . . His voice is . . . full of
melody. In gentle, compassionate tones he presents some of
the same gracious, heavenly truths which the Saviour uttered;
he heals the diseases of the people, and then, in his assumed
character of Christ, he claims to have changed the Sabbath to
Sunday, and commands all to hallow the day which he has
blessed. He declares that those who persist in keeping holy the
seventh day are blaspheming his name by refusing to listen to
his angels sent to them with light and truth. This is the strong,
almost overmastering delusion."—The Great Controversy, p. 624.
   How widespread will be the acceptance of this event? Rev.
13:8; Matt. 24:24-26.

  What will interrupt the progress of Satan's program to
gain control of the whole world through his agent, Babylon?
Rev. 16:1-21 (compare 18:8-24; Dan. 12:1).

   These plagues will occur suddenly and unexpectedly in various
parts of the earth. Evidently they will last for a short period of
time prior to Jesus' coming.

THE CHURCH'S FINAL TRAVAIL (Rev. 13:14-17; 1 Peter 1:7-
9).
   The last plagues will serve the fourfold function of (1) re-
vealing the false claims of Babylon and the antichrist by dem-
onstrating that they do not represent God (Ps. 9:15-20); (2)
interrupting the attempts of the wicked to destroy the right-
eous (Rev. 16:4-6); (3) exposing the godless hearts and malice of
those who worship the beast (Rev. 16:9-11, 21); (4) revealing
whom God approves by virtue of their immunity to the plagues
(Ps. 27:1-6).

  What will the time of the plagues be like for God's people?
Rev. 13:14-17.


   "Though God's people are surrounded by enemies who are
bent upon their destruction, yet the anguish which they suffer
is not a dread of persecution for the truth's sake; they fear that
every sin has not been repented of. . . . If they could have the
assurance of pardon they would not shrink from torture or
death; but should they prove unworthy, and lose their lives
because of their own defects of character, then God's holy
name would be reproached."—The Great Controversy, p. 619.
(Compare Early Writings, pp. 282-285.)

   Shortly before the final time of trouble, God's people are
sealed, and probation is closed for the wicked. Everyone will
have made a conclusive decision for or against Christ. Of
what spiritual value then is this time of trouble? Job 23:10;
Zech. 13:9; 1 Peter 1:7-9.

   "The Lord's eye is upon His people, and His ear listens to
their cries. Their affliction is great, the flames of the furnace
seem about to consume them; but the Refiner will bring them
forth as gold tried in the fire. God's love for His children
during the period of their severest trial is as strong and tender
as in the days of their sunniest prosperity; but it is needful for
them to be placed in the furnace of fire; their earthliness must
be consumed, that the image of Christ may be perfectly re-
flected."—The Great Controversy, p. 621. (Compare pp. 630, 631.)

    What preparation can you make today to face the time of
 trouble? If you are presently going through a time of trouble,
 how may you have endurance?

                                                              109

THE CHURCH'S FINEST HOUR (1 Cor. 15:51-55).

  What distinguishes Christ's loyal remnant from the hosts
who campaign against them? Rev. 12:17.


   Through his various agents, Satan has advanced the idea
that a new and more exalted system of truth has supplanted
the Holy Scriptures. His deluded followers accept his lie that
those who cling to Bible teachings are narrow-minded bigots
who block the progress of universal peace and brotherhood.
They feel that these Bible zealots must give up their antiquated
notions or die. But Christ, the Word of God (Rev. 19:13), ap-
pears to vindicate His faithful people.

   As Christ descends, what happens to the antichrist and his
followers? What happens to the saints? Rev. 14:14-20; 19:5-21
(compare 2 Thess. 1:4-10; 1 Cor. 15:51-55).


   Shortly after the death decree is issued against those who
refuse to comply with the Sunday law, it will be determined to
strike in one night a decisive blow against Sabbathkeepers.
   "With shouts of triumph, jeering, and imprecation, throngs
of evil men are about to rush upon their prey, when, lo, a dense
blackness, deeper than the darkness of the night, falls upon the
earth. Then a rainbow, shining with the glory from the throne
of God, spans the heavens and seems to encircle each praying
company. The angry multitudes are suddenly arrested. Their
mocking cries die away. The objects of their murderous rage
are forgotten. With fearful forebodings they gaze upon the
symbol of God's covenant and long to be shielded from its
overpowering brightness.
   "By the people of God a voice, clear and melodious, is heard,
saying, 'Look up,' and lifting their eyes to the heavens, they
behold the bow of promise. . . . [They] see . . . the Son of man
seated upon His throne. . . . Again a voice, musical and trium-
phant, is heard, saying, 'They come! they come! holy, harmless,
and undefiled. They have kept the word of My patience; they
shall walk among the angels'; and . . . those who have held fast
their faith, utter a shout of victory."—The Great Controversy,
pp. 635, 636.

versy, pp. 635-652. Contemplate the marvels of this chapter.

HOMEWARD BOUND (Rev. 15:2-4).
   Earthly language is powerless to describe the infinite glory
that will attend the redeemed on their day of deliverance. But
Scripture conveys, as well as words can, a sense of the jubila-
tion they will experience as the Lord transports them to His
kingdom as honored victors in the great controversy.
   As you read Isaiah 25:8, 9; 51:11; 1 Thessalonians 4:16, 17
project your mind into the scenes and record your impres-
sions.

   Do you long to hear Jesus' words addressed personally to
you and those whom you have led to Christ, "Come, ye blessed
of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
foundation of the world" (Matt. 25:34)?
  After coursing through the vast cosmos, what declaration
will the myriads of redeemed hear at the gates of the New
Jerusalem? Isa. 26:2. What experience awaits them there and
again in the new earth? Eph. 2:4-7; Isa. 64:4.

   "Then I saw Jesus lead the redeemed company to the gate of
the city. He laid hold of the gate and swung it back on its
glittering hinges and bade the nations that had kept the truth
enter in. . . . Rich glory they beheld everywhere. Then Jesus
looked upon His redeemed saints . . . and as He fixed His
loving eyes upon them, He said, with His rich, musical voice, 'I
behold the travail of My soul, and am satisfied. This rich glory
is yours to enjoy eternally. Your sorrows are ended. There shall
be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall
there be any more pain.' I saw the redeemed host bow . . . at the
feet of Jesus. . . .
   "Language is altogether too feeble to attempt a description
of heaven. As the scene rises before me, I am lost in amaze-
ment. Carried away with the surpassing splendor and excel-
lent glory, I lay down the pen, and exclaim, 'Oh, what love!
what wondrous love!' "—Early Writings, pp. 288, 289.
   What song will the redeemed sing that reveals the bless-
 ings of having received the everlasting gospel of the three
 angels' messages? Rev. 15:2-4.


                                                             111
Friday                                       December 23
FURTHER STUDY: Read John 14:1-4; Revelation 21, 22. The
consummation of the Christian's hope is entrance into the king-
dom of God. There will be joy, not only because of the raptur-
ous delights that will engulf our senses, but also because of the
matchless excitement of face-to-face communion with God, and
the holy pleasure of living in eternal fellowship with the re-
deemed. These blessings will never be jeopardized by sin, for
sin will be forever abolished by virtue of Christ's atonement
and the choice of His people to live in harmony with God's
eternal law of love.
   Also read the chapters "God's People Delivered" and "The
Time of Trouble" in The Great Controversy, pp. 613-652.

  "Motives stronger, and agencies more powerful, could never
be brought into operation; the exceeding rewards for right-
doing, the enjoyment of heaven, the society of the angels, the
communion and love of God and His Son, the elevation and
extension of all our powers throughout eternal ages—are these
not mighty incentives and encouragements to urge us to give
the heart's loving service to our Creator and Redeemer?"
—Steps to Christ, p. 21.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What can you do today to ensure that you will triumph
     with Christ in the day of His return?

  2. What changes do you need to make in your life that will
     enable you to relate to Christ's return as "the blessed
     hope" rather than as "a day of distress . . . and desola-
     tion" (Titus 2:13; Zeph. 1:14, 15)?

SUMMARY: Glorious beyond words will be the Second Com-
ing for all who love and obey Christ. Horrible beyond all de-
scription will that day be for those who have denied Him in
their behavior and beliefs. The three angels' messages have as
their central intention and aim the purpose of calling all people
to salvation by exalting Christ and His gospel. Those who
remain faithful to Jesus will find themselves condemned by
earth's highest authorities controlled by Satan. But God will
deliver and vindicate His people and elevate them to positions
of honor and glory in His kingdom. Let us choose by His
unfailing grace to be there. "Faithful is he that calleth you, who
also will do it" (1 Thess. 5:24).

                  Through Prison Walls
                         Andrea Steele

   God can reach us anywhere—inside our apartment, inside
our car, inside our unhappiness, inside our fear—or inside
prison.
   Ghetkon, in his letter to Adventist World Radio-Africa
(AWR), said, "I write from the bottom of my cell" in Cameroon,
West Africa. There he had spent many moments considering
his prison sentence because of the mistake he had made.
   Yet Ghetkon's letter was full of joy and praise. He had
discovered AWR. "One day, tuning my short-wave radio, I
found your broadcast. I was amazed. The Bible study of the
day touched my heart."
   Ghetkon continued to listen, and heard a health program
about cigarette smoking. "That program convinced me, and
since then I haven't smoked anymore."
   Ghetkon became a steady listener to the programs of AWR,
and came to know the saving power of Jesus' love. And he
made his decision public. "An evangelist came to prison to talk
about Jesus, and I accepted Jesus as my personal Saviour."
   But better health and joy in salvation were not to be the only
blessings that Ghetkon experienced because of the faith he
found in jail. Here's the good news he shared:
   "I was to be sentenced to life in prison, but thank God I was
sentenced for only 10 years and got the benefit of presidential
grace. I believe the change in my life because of Jesus made a
difference."
   No matter what kind of "prison" we are in, God has the
key—the love of Jesus—and he can open the door and set us
free. Pray today for listeners to the broadcasts of AWR, that
their experience will reflect that of Ghetkon. Here's how he
ended his letter:
   "I thank God because it was in prison that I came to accept
 Jesus as my Saviour. I am praying earnestly that this flame
 may never extinguish in my heart until the end of my life. I
                     praise Him for all he has done for me."


                        Andrea Steele, public relations director of
                     the Adventist World Radio system, heard about
                     Ghetkon's story from Gallein Thiombiano,
                     associate program director for AWR-Africa.

    The Three Angels'
   Messages and Your Life




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Rom. 16:25-27; 1 Thess.
2:13; Rev. 19:6-10.
   MEMORY TEXT: "Looking for that blessed hope, and the
   glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus
   Christ; who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us
   from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people,
   zealous of good works" (Titus 2:13, 14).

   KEY THOUGHT: The three angels' messages are designed
to produce in our lives the fruit of godly character and godly
deeds. Thus our witness will be empowered with an influence
that will win every honest-hearted person to Christ and His
eternal truth.
   THE THREE ANGELS' MESSAGES REVEAL JESUS. These
messages clarify and emphasize the true gospel as distinct
from the false theories of salvation promoted by the devil and
his followers. In our lessons this quarter we have seen how the
three angels encompass the whole scope of humanity's need in
this age of suffering, sin, and spiritual confusion. This final
week of the quarter we will review the key elements of these
messages with special emphasis on the experience they bring
forth in the lives of those who receive and proclaim them.

Sunday                                      December 25
ROOTED IN THE GOSPEL (Ps. 51:10-13).

   How does God describe the character of His people who
have been sealed and commissioned to give the three angels'
messages? Rev. 14:4, 5 (Jude 24, 25; 1 Thess. 5:23, 24).
   What do the following statements mean?
They "have not defiled themselves with women" (RSV).
They "follow the Lamb wherever he goes" (RSV).
"These have been redeemed from mankind" (RSV).
"And in their mouth no lie was found" (RSV).
"They are without fault."
   "As we partake of the divine nature, hereditary and culti-
vated tendencies to wrong are cut away from the character,
and we are made a living power for good. . . . God works, and
man works, that man may be one with Christ as Christ is one
with God."—That I May Know Him, p. 95. (See also Phil. 2:13;
3:12-15.)
   "The spotless robe of Christ's righteousness is placed upon
the tried, tempted, yet faithful children; of God."—Testimonies,
vol. 5, p. 475.
    As our union with Christ matures, what kind of experi-
ence are we given? With what result? Ps. 51:10-13; 2 Cor. 2:14-
16.

   God's people do not exult over their moral development.
They do not regard themselves as perfect or superior to others
(Job 9:20, 21). But they are motivated by God's love to share the
gospel from which they have received soul-saving benefit.
They cannot bottle up the blessing or speak of it in hushed,
apologetic tones. With both zeal and tact they proclaim a cruci-
fied and risen Saviour to the world. And because their lives
demonstrate what they preach, their message has credibility
and appeal. (See John 7:37-39.)
    What special counsel do God's people observe? Col. 2:6-
10. How does this counsel relate to the three angels' mes-
 sages? Rev. 14:8-12; 22:14.
                                                             115

WHAT MANNER OF PERSONS? (Rev. 15:2-4).
    What kind of spiritual experience are the three angels'
messages designed to produce? Rev. 15:2-4 (compare 1 Thess.
1:9, 10).

    In these messages, the Lord brings forth judgment unto
truth—truth that engenders the victory for those who receive
the Word of God as it is written. For to receive the truth is to
receive Christ and all His word (John 14:6, 23). And that word,
abiding in us, gives us power to overcome evil (1 John 2:14).
   Why does Satan fail to destroy God's obedient people
despite the intensity of his attack? Rev. 12:10-11, 17; 14:1.

    Although Satan raises a storm of persecution against God's
people in the last days, they remain faithful because of the
mercies of the Lamb. Because they are more concerned about
pleasing God and living in fellowship with Him than with
escaping privation and persecution, He protects them and grants
them an especially rich spiritual experience.
     "The Lord Jesus is making experiments on human hearts
through the exhibition of His mercy and abundant grace. He is
effecting transformations so amazing that Satan, with all his
triumphant boasting, with all his confederacy of evil united
against God and the laws of His government, stands viewing
them as a fortress impregnable to his sophistries and delu-
sions. They are to him an incomprehensible mystery."—The
Faith I Live By, p. 142. (See the mystery explained in Col. 1:26-
28.)
    Why do God's people, although clad in the invincible
righteousness of Christ and possessing His approval, not
have a proud, self-assured opinion of their spirituality? Hab.
2:4; Eph. 3:8; 1 Tim. 1:15.

  "We must behold Christ. . . . When we contemplate His
purity and excellence, we shall see our own weakness and
poverty and defects as they really are. . . . We shall see that if
we are ever saved, it will not be through our own goodness,
but through God's infinite grace."—Christ's Object Lessons, p.
159.

Tuesday                                     December 27
A MINISTRY-MINDED PEOPLE (Matt. 28:18-20).

   The three angels' messages quicken evangelistic zeal in all
who receive them and begin to comprehend their worth. They
arouse the soul to a life of devotion to God and service to
humankind.

   Reread the three angels' messages (Rev. 14:6-12) in con-
nection with Matthew 28:18-20. Be prepared to share with
your class what these messages mean to you personally. What
elements do you discover in these messages that motivate
you to witness to others of Jesus' love?


    Christ "would have His servants bear testimony to the fact
that through His grace men may possess Christlikeness of char-
acter, and may rejoice in the assurance of His great love. He
would have us bear testimony to the fact that He cannot be
satisfied until the human race are reclaimed and reinstated in
their holy privileges as His sons and daughters."—The Desire of
Ages, p. 826.
    Note how this contrasts with the emissaries of Babylon,
who not only propagate confusion and corruption but who
strive to kill those who refuse their cup of apostasy!

   What fact about the times in which we live should give
urgency to our soul-winning efforts? Luke 21:7-11, 28-33;
2 Tim. 3:1-9.


    "We should now feel the responsibility of laboring with
intense earnestness to impart to others the truths that God has
given for this time. . . .
    "Now is the time for the last warning to be given. There is a
special power in the presentation of the truth at the present
time; but how long will it continue? Only a little while. . . .
    "Men need to be aroused to realize the solemnity of the
time, the nearness of the day when human probation shall be
ended. Decided efforts should be made to bring the message
for this time prominently before the people. The third angel is
to go forth with great power."—Evangelism, pp. 16, 17.

   Are you willing to bear fruit for Christ's kingdom? Do
 you believe in His ability to prosper your efforts in soul-
 winning? Seek fresh ways to witness for Him today.

                                                             117
Wednesday                                   December 28
A SPIRIT-FILLED PEOPLE (Isa. 60:1-5).
    When God's people proclaim the third angel's message in
its fullness, what power will attend their labors, and with
what effect? Rev. 18:1; Isa. 60:1-3.

    The Holy Spirit will attend the final proclamation of the
third angel's message with unprecedented power and urgency
for humanity's salvation.
    "All who consecrate soul, body, and spirit to God will be
constantly receiving a new endowment of physical and mental
power. The inexhaustible supplies of heaven are at their com-
mand. Christ gives them the breath of His own spirit, the life of
His own life. The Holy Spirit puts forth its highest energies to
work in heart and mind. The grace of God enlarges and multi-
plies their faculties, and every perfection of the divine nature
comes to their assistance in the work of saving souls. Through
co-operation with Christ they are complete in Him, and in their
human weakness they are enabled to do the deeds of Omnipo-
tence."—The Desire of the Ages, p. 827. (Read This Day With God,
p. 314.)
   As we give the three angels' messages, what are we really
proclaiming? Rev. 14:6; 19:5-9; 22:16, 17.

    "The message of Christ's righteousness is to sound from one
end of the earth to the other to prepare the way of the Lord.
This is the glory of God, which closes the work of the third
angel. . . . This message [Rev. 14:9-121 . . . is represented as
being given with a loud voice; that is, with the power of the
Holy Spirit."—Last Day Events, pp. 200, 201.
    With purity, joy, and vitality God's people will make this
last true gospel appeal to a frightened and frantic world. Many
will hear the echo of the true Shepherd's voice in this proclama-
tion, and with thankful haste will come out of Babylon to join
the remnant church, which keeps the commandments of God
and the faith of Jesus.
    What are our greatest needs as we prepare to give the
third angel's message in its fullest significance and power?
Jer. 23:5, 6; Luke 11:9-13; Zech. 10:1, 12. Without being self-
righteous or judgmental of others, in what tactful ways can
we encourage our fellow church members to join us in
giving the three angels' messages?
118
Thursday                                     December 29
A PATIENT, PERSEVERING PEOPLE (Heb. 11:33-40).
   What is the patience of the saints referred to in the book
of Revelation? Rev. 1:9; 13:10; 14:12.

    Those who love and proclaim the three angels' messages
will have an experience with God that fortifies them to with-
stand the rage and hostility of the apostate. The saints will be
keenly tried, especially by former brethren who have aposta-
tized from the truth and enslaved themselves to Babylon. (Read
The Great Controversy, p. 608.)
    "Let there be a revival of the faith and power of the early
church, and the spirit of persecution will be revived, and the
fires of persecution will be rekindled.—The Great Controversy,
p. 48.
   How will this persecution affect God's people? Heb. 11:33-
40; Rev. 12:11.

    "When the storm of persecution really breaks upon us, the
true sheep will hear the true Shepherd's voice. Self-denying
efforts will be put forth to save the lost, and many who have
strayed from the fold will come back to follow the great Shep-
herd. The people of God will draw together and present to the
enemy a united front. . . .
    "The love of Christ, the love of our brethren, will testify to
the world that we have been with Jesus and learned of Him.
Then will the message of the third angel swell to a loud cry,
and the whole earth will be lightened with the glory of the
Lord."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 401. (See John 15:13-21.)
   What strengthened the heroes and heroines of the cross in
past ages not only to bear persecution but also to persevere
with intensified energy in their mission as God's witnesses?
2 Tim. 4:16-18; 1 Peter 4:12-14.

    Persecution will elevate and purify the experience of God's
people (Rom. 5:3). As partakers of Christ's sufferings, we shall
also be partakers of His kingdom and glory. Only true, unself-
ish love could motivate us to suffer for the sake of the gospel.
    In what way can you obtain the patience (endurance) of
 the saints?
                                                              119
Friday                                       December 30
FURTHER STUDY: In light of the three angels' messages,
contemplate Hosea 14:9; Malachi 4:5, 6; John 15:10-27. For an
inspiring overview of these messages read the chapter "The
Work for This Time" in Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 14-22.
   Out of trial and tribulation God's people will arise victori-
ous. They will not only vanquish the hosts of darkness, but
they will be instrumental in the redemption of former rebels
against God's kingdom. The greatest triumph over one's en-
emies is to make friends of them. This is God's way. The three
angels' messages are the harbingers of reconciliation and hope.
Their appeal assures that the everlasting gospel will have a
final hearing before the world, so that all may choose whom
they will serve.
   The way we live these messages as we proclaim them will
greatly influence those whom we seek to reach. May we ex-
perience these messages in our own lives so that we portray
Christ in the beauty of His holiness.
 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Prepare to discuss the significance of the three angels'
     messages in connection with the following statement:
     "When the books of Daniel and Revelation are better
     understood, believers will have an entirely different reli-
     gious experience. They will be given such glimpses of
     the open gates of heaven that heart and mind will be
     impressed with the character that all must develop in
     order to realize the blessedness which is to be the reward
     of the pure in heart."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 114.
  2. Prepare to discuss how the experience and character of
     the redeemed relate to the content and aim of the mes-
     sage they bear (Rev. 14:6-12).
SUMMARY: Spiritual power of the highest order energizes
the lives of those who walk in the light of the three angels.
These people receive grace, inspiration, and endurance through
the indwelling of the Holy Spirit to be His witnesses to all parts
of the world. They live out and proclaim the true gospel of
Jesus Christ for the sake of all who wish to be saved in God's
appointed way.

a►eral Mission                  The Peace Feast
                                  James H. Zachary

             In Papua New Guinea the old chief told the story with a mixture
         of joy and sorrow in his voice. Four years earlier his son got drunk
         and had an automobile accident that killed a woman and two
         children from a neighboring tribe.
            The law of the jungle is the payback system—an eye for an eye.
         Soon relatives of the dead woman had killed three of the chief's
         men.
             Four years of fighting and killing followed. The police tried to
         stop the fighting. They burned houses in the hope that families
         would turn to rebuilding their villages instead of fighting. Still the
         war raged. In less than four years 40 persons had died.
             Each tribe had a small Adventist church. Members gathered to
         pray for peace, then they devised a plan. They formed a choir.
         During one of the skirmishes the choir marched onto the battlefield,
         singing. The music disarmed the warriors, who stopped fighting. A
         church elder stepped forward. "Brothers, it is time to stop the
         bloodshed," he said. Looking to one of the leaders he pleaded,
         "Will you lay down your weapons and join in a peace feast?"
             A hush spread over the crowd as they waited to see what would
         happen. Slowly the leader of one tribe stepped forward. Then the
         leader of the other tribe did the same. The two men laid aside their
         weapons and shook hands.
             Moments later the Adventist women from the two churches
         arrived with food; together the two clans ate a peace feast.
             A few weeks later the two Adventist churches held a joint camp
         meeting for both tribes on the location where the woman and
         children died. Three thousand people attended, and evangelism
         followed.
             The membership in one of those tiny churches has grown from
         19 to more than 300. I witnessed a wonderful testimony to the
         power of the gospel: a Communion service. Tall, strong men, once
         warriors, once enemies, now washed one another's feet.
              As they rose from their knees, they embraced. I understood their
                                pigeon English, "Brudder you bolong me."
                                   Praise God for the power of the gospel that
                                can make enemies brothers in Christ!

                    Fever
                             by George Knight
October 23, 1844. One day after the faithful were to have
gone home to heaven with Jesus. But Jesus didn't come,
and the advent believers felt chained to the earth, reeling
in shock and grief.
   It is now fifteen decades after the great disappointment,
and Jesus still hasn't come. Ever-deepening disillusionment
                                      and skepticism crowd
                                    4 the minds of many.

        WE
       STILL
      BELIEVE         by Robert Folkenberg
 A century and a half after the 1844 disappointment, can we
 seriously say that Jesus is coming "soon"? The leader of the
 worldwide Seventh-day Adventist Church boldly proclaims
 that "WE STILL BELIEVE."
                                     Elder Folkenberg honestly
                                   looks at the challenges and
                                    questions that the delay
                                    poses and assures us that
                                     we can, indeed, have
                                     unshakable confidence that
                                     Jesus is coming soon and
                                      the early advent teachings
                                       are still relevant.
                                           At a time when doubt
                                        and cyncism threaten our
                                        advent hope, this faith-
                                         restoring book will help
                                         you affirm the truth
                                          that we still believe!
