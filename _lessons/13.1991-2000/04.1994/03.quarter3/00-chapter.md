   The day He didn't come

                       Fever
                                by George Knight
October 23, 1844. One day after the faithful were to have
gone home to heaven with Jesus. But Jesus didn't come,
and the advent believers felt chained to the earth, reeling
in shock and grief.
   It is now fifteen decades after the great disappointment,
and Jesus still hasn't come. Ever-deepening disillusionment
                                      and skepticism crowd
                                       the minds of many.

                       Introduction
                  Philippians and Colossians
    This quarter's lessons are based on Paul's letters to the churches
 at Philippi and Colossae, which were written during his first
 imprisonment in Rome (about A.D. 61-63). Although the Epistle
 to the Colossians was probably written before the Epistle to the
Philippians, we will study the books in the order in which they
appear in the New Testament.
    While at Troas on his second missionary journey, Paul re-
ceived the divine commission to take the gospel to Macedonia
(Acts 16:8-19). The first Macedonian city he visited was Philippi
(Acts 16:11, 12). On the Sabbath day, meeting by the riverside,
Paul and his companions led Lydia and her household to Christ.
Thus the Philippian church was launched. (See Acts 16:13-15.) In
the same city, the Lord used Paul as the instrument to deliver a
slave girl from demon possession. Accused by her Philippian
employers, Paul and Silas were thrust into prison. A midnight
earthquake gave them the opportunity to witness to the jailer,
who was baptized along with his family. Although Paul and
Silas were forced to leave the city, the foundation had been laid
for a flourishing Philippian church. (See Acts 16:16-40.)
    More than 10 years later, during Paul's first Roman im-
prisonment, the Philippian church sent Epaphroditus, one of
their leaders, to supply Paul's needs with gifts and ministry
(Phil. 2:25; 4:18). The Philippian Christians sent messages of
concern to Rome because they had heard of Epaphroditus' ill-
ness. When he had recovered, Paul sent him home to Philippi
with a letter of encouragement and instruction for the church.
    Paul expresses gratitude for the faithfulness of the Philippian
Christians, but wishes them to exalt Christ as supreme in their
lives so that they will grow constantly toward true humility,
love, unity, purity, and spiritual blamelessness. Just as his wit-
ness in Rome was being blessed with success, so would be theirs.

 VI. Conclusion (Phil. 4:21-23).
   Evidently the Colossian church was raised up by Epaphras
(Col. 1:7), not by Paul. Some questions remain regarding whether
Paul ever visited Colossae. (See Col. 2:1.) But, undoubtedly,
because of his evangelistic endeavors in the Roman province of
Asia, he was the real spiritual father of the Colossian Christians.
For three years, Ephesus was the home base of Paul's preaching
ministry (Acts 20:31). During this time "all the residents of Asia
heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks" (Acts 19:10,
RSV). If Paul did not visit Colossae in this period, the gospel was
taken there by those who heard his preaching in Ephesus.
Epaphras might well have been one of these. (See Col. 4:12,13.)
   While visiting Rome, Epaphras gave Paul information re-
garding the spiritual needs of the Colossian Christians (Col. 1:8;
compare Philemon 23). Despite their strong faith, they were
exposed to Jewish and pagan legalism that threatened to retard
their spiritual growth. Paul exalts Christ as the source of forgive-
ness and the means of growth toward spiritual maturity. The
epistles to Colossae, Ephesus, and Philemon were delivered by
Tychicus and Onesimus, who had been in Rome with Paul. (See
Col. 4:7-9; Eph. 6:21,22; Philemon 10-12.)

Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Phil. 1:1-11.

    MEMORY TEXT: "Being confident of this very thing, that
    he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it
    until the day of Jesus Christ" (Philippians 1:6).

   KEY THOUGHT: Paul introduces his letter to the Philippians
by rejoicing in their faith and love and focusing on the spiritual
goals that Christ upholds to Christians. Christ supplies the
power to reach these goals.

   PAUL'S HOPES WERE CENTERED ON CHRIST. Lan-
guishing in a Roman prison, Paul could have been discour-
aged about the future of the infant church. Imperial Rome was
making the life of Christians desperately difficult. Smooth-
talking, highly persuasive critics of Paul's teaching were
confusing congregations throughout the Mediterranean basin
regarding faith and works and the purpose of the gospel.
   But Paul took heart. The best evidence that he had preached
the genuine gospel rested in the changed lives of converts in
places like Philippi and Colossae and their clear understand-
ing regarding the purpose of the gospel.
   Though his earthly future was always uncertain, Paul knew
beyond all reasonable doubt that the gospel seed Christ had
planted in the Philippians' hearts would bear fruit that would
stand the test of time and eternity.

SAINTS HAVE GRACE AND PEACE (Phil. 1:1, 2, 7).
  How does Paul identify himself and Timothy? Phil. 1:1.

   The Greek word translated "servants" means "slaves." In
antiquity people became slaves: (1) by birth; (2) by being made
prisoners of war; (3) because of debt. In similar ways human
beings become slaves to sin. We were born with fallen natures
(Ps. 51:5; 58:3); Satan makes us prisoners of war when we try to
fight him in our own strength (Rom. 7:18); we are also en-
slaved by the debt of our sins (Rom. 6:23). Jesus Christ, our
Redeemer, releases us from the slavery of sin when we become
His willing slaves. (See Acts 4:12; John 8:36.) Paul and Timothy
had discovered that slavery to Christ is genuine freedom!
   Paul specifically identifies his target audience in Philippi:
saints, bishops (or presbyters, ministers; see Titus 1:5-7), and
deacons. In Scripture, saints are believers in Christ (Acts 9:32;
Rom. 1:7; 8:27; 12:13). The Greek word means "holy ones."
They are holy because, by faith, they receive the gift of Christ's
holiness. Paul wrote to the believers in Corinth, "to those who
have been sanctified [made holy] in Christ Jesus, called saints
[holy ones]" (1 Cor. 1:2, literal translation). Because of their
divisions, the Corinthians were losing the experience that the
Philippians were continuing to enjoy.
   What do the following passages teach regarding the source
and meaning of grace and peace? Phil. 1:2, 7; 1 Cor. 15:10;
2 Cor. 9:8; Rom. 5:1.

   The Bible uses the word grace to mean God's favor to those
who do not merit it. God's grace is His loving concern manifest
by His active intervention in human hearts, enabling spiritual
victory and service for others. For the Corinthians, Paul thanked
God "because of the grace of God which was given you in
Christ Jesus, that in every way you were enriched in him with all
speech and all knowledge . . . so that you are not lacking in any
spiritual gift" (1 Cor. 1:4-7, RSV).

    Christ's exalted spiritual goals for us are always accom-
 panied by the promise of power (grace). Those who by
 faith receive Christ's grace have incomparable peace of
 mind. Their sins are forgiven, and they have the power to
 live for Christ. (See John 14:27; Rom. 8:6; Phil. 4:7.)

                                                                 9

"IT'S NOT OVER TILL IT'S OVER" (Phil. 1:3-6).

   An Olympic swimmer encouraged his teammate, who was
not doing well in the qualifying rounds, by saying, "It's not
over till it's over." The teammate improved her performance
and went on to win a medal. As they view their poor perform-
ance, Christians sometimes despair of winning the incorrupt-
ible crown of which Paul wrote (1 Cor. 9:25). But Paul reminds
us that there is hope. Every day we can be winners in Christ.
He "always causeth us to triumph" because He triumphed
(2 Cor. 2:14).

   Why was Paul especially thankful for the Philippian Chris-
tians? Phil. 1:3-5; 4:14-18.


   What may we be assured that Christ will continually do
for us? Phil. 1:6.


   Not only does Christ launch spiritual athletes on a career of
spiritual achievement, He also continually provides the neces-
sary motivation and power for them to grow in godliness. (See
2 Peter 1:3, 4; 3:18.) Philippians 1:6 may be translated: "Because
I have been convinced (and therefore I am now certain) of this
very fact—that the One who began in you a good work will go
on pushing it to completion until the day of Christ Jesus."
—Randolph 0. Yeager, The Renaissance New Testament (Gretna,
La.: Pelican, 1983), vol. 14, p. 391.
   "Perform" (Phil. 1:6, KJV) may be better translated "per-
fect," "fulfill its purpose," or "bring to completion" (RSV).
Paul refers elsewhere to this same work promised by Jesus for
those who have confidence in Him. (See 2 Cor. 7:1.)
   The good work that will be perfected or completed (Phil.
1:6), the holiness made perfect (2 Cor. 7:1), is possible, not
because of the Christian's willpower, but because God "is able"
(2 Tim. 1:12; Jude 24) to perform what He has promised (2 Cor.
6:16-18). Even though we must continually choose fellowship
with Christ, our confidence rests in God's promises to pardon
and perform, not in our own merit or self-discipline.

  "God has made provision that we may become like unto
Him, and He will accomplish this for all who do not inter-
pose a perverse will and thus frustrate His grace."—Thoughts
Front the Mount of Blessing, p. 76.

GROWTH PRECEDES VICTORY (Phil. 1:8, 9).
   What example of loving concern for others did Paul pro-
vide us? Phil. 1:8.

   The New International Version translates the text: "God can
testify how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ
Jesus." How many of us can honestly claim that our longing
for the salvation of others is a genuine reflection of the love of
Christ?
   "How little do we enter into sympathy with Christ on that
which should be the strongest bond of union between us and
Him—compassion for depraved, guilty, suffering souls, dead
in trespasses and sins! The inhumanity of man toward man is
our greatest sin. Many think that they are representing the
justice of God, while they wholly fail of representing His ten-
derness and His great love."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 163.
  How did Paul outline the course and goal of growth in
holiness? Phil. 1:9.

   The Greek word used here for "love" signifies more than
family or friendship love, or love between the sexes. Paul is
urging the development of that love which Jesus alone has
revealed, love that is unselfish and not necessarily directed to
those deserving appreciation or those who will reciprocate.
Such love is truly a principle and not merely an emotion; it
desires the other's good and offers service for another though
it may be refused. Such love requires personal sacrifice. (See
John 15:13.)
   "Knowledge" refers to knowledge that is learned through
personal experience; thus it is more than theoretical knowl-
edge. Many know about Jesus; fewer know Him as a personal
Saviour and a daily companion. Only a truly loving person is
growing in the practical knowledge of Christian experience.
    "Judgment" (Phil. 1:9, KJV) or "discernment" (RSV) empha-
sizes that truly loving persons, growing in their friendship
with Christ, will develop skill in perceiving truth and duty
even as eyeglasses are needed to restore clear eyesight to the
visually impaired. (See John 7:17.) The purpose of redemption
is to restore what sin has marred, to turn self-centered rebels
into loving, grateful sons and daughters of God. Their eyes are
open more and more to the truth, and they see sin for what it
is. (See 1 Thess. 3:12-4:3.)
                                                                11

THE GOAL IS ATTAINABLE (Phil. 1:10).

  How does Paul describe the end product of spiritual growth?
Phil. 1:10.


   "So that you may be able to discern what is best" (NIV).
Paul's point is that Christians are to use their knowledge and
insight (judgment, verse 9), imparted by the Holy Spirit, to
make intelligent, informed, and morally right choices.
   "Sincere" (KJV) is from a Greek word that describes some-
thing that has passed the test of sunlight. The same Greek
word may be translated "pure" (2 Peter 3:1). Inward purity
results in blameless behavior. In ancient times a potter could
mend a cracked piece of pottery with wax and paint over it to
conceal the flaw. The unsuspecting buyer might leave the pot
in the sun and the wax would melt, revealing the fault. To be
sincere means to be "tested by the sun" and found to be with-
out wax.
   "And may be pure and blameless until the day of Christ"
(Phil. 1:10, NIV). The Greek word translated "without offence"
(KJV) means "undamaged," "blameless." The word is used
only three times in the New Testament. In his trial before Felix,
Paul testified: "And herein do I exercise myself, to have always
a conscience void of offence toward God, and toward men" (Acts
24:16). Paul instructed the Corinthians: "So, whether you eat
or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. Give
no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God" (1 Cor.
10:31, 32, RSV). Paul's desire for the Philippians was that they
would grow spiritually to the point at which they would have
habitual victory over sin, that they would be blameless in
relation to both God and humanity.

   What counsel given elsewhere in the New Testament re-
lates to Paul's instruction to the Philippians? Eph. 4:13;
1 Peter 1:15, 16; Rev. 14:5.



   Satan "is constantly seeking to deceive the followers of
Christ with his fatal sophistry that it is impossible for them
to overcome. But Jesus pleads in their behalf His wounded
hands, His bruised body; and He declares to all who would
follow Him: 'My grace is sufficient for thee.' 2 Corinthians
12:9."—The Great Controversy, p. 489.

THE REWARD FOR SEEKERS (Phil. 1:11).
   What does Paul mean when he says that the goal of the
Christian is to be "filled with the fruits of righteousness"
(Phil. 1:11)? Compare the following passages that mention
righteousness or its fruits.
Matt. 5:6
2 Cor. 5:21
Gal. 5:22, 23
Col. 1:10

   To be "filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes
through Jesus Christ" (Phil. 1:11, NIV) we must be filled with
righteousness itself. Christ is our righteousness (1 Cor. 1:30).
His presence in our hearts by the Holy Spirit is righteousness
within. (See John 14:18.) Those who seek for the presence of
Christ in their lives, who thus "hunger and thirst after right-
eousness" (Matt. 5:6), will be filled with the Holy Spirit, who
will produce in the life the fruit of righteousness: "love, joy,
peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness
and self-control" (Gal. 5:22, 23, NIV). Because their thoughts,
words, and deeds are directed by those attitudes, they bear
"fruit in every good work" (Col. 1:10, NIV).
  How did Jesus expect His followers to "bear much fruit"?
John 15:1-8. How does this counsel explain Paul's emphasis
that the Christian's goal is to be unsullied and blameless and
thus filled with the "fruits of righteousness" (Phil. 1:11)?


    "The object of the husbandman in the sowing of the
 seed and the culture of the growing plant is the production
 of grain [Mark 4:26-291. . . . So the divine Husbandman
 looks for a harvest as the reward of His labor and sacrifice.
 Christ is seeking to reproduce Himself in the hearts of
 men; and He does this through those who believe in Him.
 The object of the Christian life is fruit bearing—the repro-
 duction of Christ's character in the believer, that it may be
 reproduced in others."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 67.


                                                              13
Friday                                                 July 1
FURTHER STUDY: Read the comments on Matthew 5:6 in
Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pp. 18-21. Study the effec-
tiveness of God's grace in the heart: Rom. 5:17; 12:6-8; 1 Cor.
15:10; 2 Cor. 9:8, 14; Heb. 13:9; 2 Peter 3:18.

   "The righteousness which Christ taught is conformity of
heart and life to the revealed will of God. Sinful men can
become righteous only as they have faith in God and maintain
a vital connection with Him. Then true godliness will elevate
the thoughts and ennoble the life. Then the external forms of
religion accord with the Christian's internal purity. . . .
   "'Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in
heaven is perfect.' This command is a promise. The plan of
redemption contemplates our complete recovery from the power
of Satan. Christ always separates the contrite soul from sin. He
came to destroy the works of the devil, and He has made
provision that the Holy Spirit shall be imparted to every re-
pentant soul, to keep him from sinning. . . .
   "The ideal of Christian character is Christlikeness. As the
Son of man was perfect in His life, so His followers are to be
perfect in their life."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 310, 311.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What regular steps must we take to ensure that Christ's
     sanctifying work will go forward in our lives?

     2. A young man once commented that the goal of com-
        plete spiritual blamelessness (Phil. 1:10) is not pos-
        sible in this life. He said that we can never arrive at
        that exalted standard, even though we are to keep mov-
        ing toward it. Was he right or wrong? Why do you
        think as you do? (See Early Writings, p. 71.)

     3. In what ways can each of us employ the "fruits of
        righteousness" (Phil. 1:11, RSV) this week in our ef-
        forts to lead others to Christ?

SUMMARY: In writing to the Philippians, Paul upheld the
grace or power of Christ as the source of peace of mind and of
the ability to live a blameless Christian life. We may experi-
ence the divine goal of victory over sin by constant fellowship
with Jesus. The work that Jesus began in us when we first
believed will go forward until His second advent and will
continue throughout eternity.

               Global Mission in Wales
                           P. R. Clee

   How does a church evangelize a country where few people
speak the national language, secularism and materialism pervade,
society, and unemployment is rampant?
   Wales is a picturesque country on the western corner of the
main island of Great Britain. The Welsh people are proud of their
cultural heritage and nation. They want their own identity, their
own national language, although most people cannot read or
understand it. Children now must learn Welsh in schools, and
some school districts teach all subjects in Welsh.
   Strong anti-British sentiment has made evangelism difficult.
Often people will not read tracts or books printed in England.
And as many as three-quarters of the people have difficulty
understanding the tracts printed in Welsh. Bilingual ma-
terials (English in one half, Welsh in the other) seem to have had
better reception, but translation work has been frustratingly
slow, since only three of 472 Welsh church members speak the
language well enough to help in translation.
   Church membership in Wales is concentrated on the
south coast and along the English border to the east. The
vast central area of Wales remains virtually untouched. In
one area in central Wales, two new converts recently joined
three elderly persons working to evangelize their area. They
personally purchased Voice of Prophecy cards and gave
them out to every home in town in preparation for evange-
listic meetings. Evangelist Dalbert Elias held a short Bible
Lands series there that attracted at least 22 non-Adventists
nightly. Hope is high for a good baptism.
    Enthusiasm for Global Mission has prompted some congre-
gations to establish branch Sabbath Schools and "daughter"
congregations—even when the parent congregation numbers
only 25 to 30 members! Five new groups were established last
year, three of them in previously unentered areas.
                        Work is slow in Wales, in part because
                     of nationalism and materialism. Now secu-
                     larism, long the bane of England, is mak-
                     ing inroads into this formerly religious
                     country. Pray for more workers, especially
                     more literature evangelists to help pre-
                     pare the nation for Christ's soon coming.

                     P. R. Clee is president of the Seventh-day
                   Adventist Welsh Mission.

           Jesus, Our Friend




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Phil. 1:12-30.
     MEMORY TEXT: "For to me to live is Christ, and to die is
     gain" (Philippians 1:21).

   KEY THOUGHT: Christ will be exalted in the lives and
work of His faithful servants, despite the opposition they are
obliged to face and the persecution that, at times, they are
called to endure.

   LIFE WITH JESUS IS LIFE AT ITS BEST. Our lesson this
week reveals more about Christ's character reflected through
the apostle Paul, who could sing triumphantly while all earthly
support seemed to be slipping away.
   Paul was not one of a kind. He was simply a man who had
discovered the greatest open secret of the universe: With Jesus
as his friend, nothing distressing would last forever, and God's
beautiful gifts could never be lost.
   Jeremiah had learned this when all earthly support, even
that of his fellow priests, not only failed but turned against
him. Daniel, Joseph, Esther, and others could face their tough
times with a song. Such believers had absorbed the principle of
our memory text long years before Paul wrote it. And Paul
lived it for years before he wrote it.
   Even times of great distress may be occasions of great Chris-
tian witnessing. We can only guess how many Roman legion-
naires and palace civil servants will be in the kingdom because
of Paul's dedicated life.

BONDS FOR CHRIST (Phil. 1:12-14).
  How did Paul relate to troubles that would have been
devastating to most people? Phil. 1:12, 13.

   "Palace" (verse 13, KJV) is better rendered "the praetorium,"
that is, the imperial guard. Paul was no common prisoner, as
the Romans soon discovered. During his imprisonment Paul
enjoyed the luxury of having friends visit and the privilege of
witnessing for his faith. (See Acts 28:30, 31.) Guarded by mem-
bers of Nero's own lifeguard regiment, as if he were an enor-
mous threat to the emperor, Paul had a constantly changing
audience. Evidently many came to know the courage, joy, and
graciousness of this prisoner who spoke with such charm about
the crucified Galilean.
   Paul was a true leader. He counted the risk of leadership
before he accepted the honor. When others might be bemoan-
ing, "Poor Paul," or "What do we do now?" or "It's all over—
we will never make it," the signal shot out from Rome: "What
has happened is serving to advance the gospel. This is the time
for courage. How else would we ever have gained the atten-
tion of so many people, even Caesar's household?"
   Something extraordinary happened in that Roman prison,
and it gave those tough legionnaires and thousands "in all
other places," and millions of Christians ever since, an impor-
tant lesson in reality perception. In effect Paul said, "Every-
thing that has happened must be seen for its true significance. I
am in bonds because Jesus wants me where I can do the most
good in telling His story."
  What effect can our patience in the midst of trial have
upon others who are trying to serve Christ? Phil. 1:14.

   "Paul's patience and cheerfulness during his long and un-
just imprisonment, his courage and faith, were a continual
sermon. His spirit, so unlike the spirit of the world, bore wit-
ness that a power higher than that of earth was abiding with
him. And by his example, Christians were impelled to greater
energy as advocates of the cause from the public labors of
which Paul had been withdrawn."—The Acts of the Apostles, p.
464.



                                                              17

CHRIST, REGARDLESS (Phil. 1:15-18).

   Describe the two kinds of minister to whom the churches
at Rome were listening. Phil. 1:15-17.


   Nothing suggests that Paul was referring to Judaizers like
those who plagued him in other places. (See Gal. 1:6, 7.) Ap-
parently those who spoke "the word without fear" (Phil. 1:14)
and those who-preached "Christ even of envy and strife" (verse
15) were not preaching false doctrine. But Paul divided them
on the basis of motive: goodwill motivated by love on one
hand, and envy and rivalry motivated by selfish ambition on
the other.
   Probably Paul was seen as a threat to the ministers who
served the church at Rome before he arrived. How can anyone
explain jealousy? Everyone knows the feeling: a relative gets
recognition, a younger worker impresses the boss, a colleague
gets recognition that you have been working for.
   The words are appropriate. No fault can be found. But the
spirit, the motive, belies the public pretense. As a Christian,
how should you relate to those who work by your side, "not
sincerely," only adding "affliction" to your "bonds"? Take a
lesson from Paul!
   When one is motivated by Christlike love wherein the chief
desire is to please others and to work for their best interests,
there is joy in the success of colleagues.

  Rather than contend for his own rights, what was Paul's
chief concern regarding his Lord? Phil. 1:18.


   "Pretense" refers to those who sail under a false flag; their
words may be correct, but their motives are not pure—they
merely pretend.
   Paul was not blind. But he was profoundly optimistic. He
was so deeply committed to Christ that fellow preachers who
suavely preached Christ while hurting Paul got only his sup-
port in return! No matter how they used Paul's circumstances
to belittle him, Paul's only concern was Christ, regardless.


   How can I test my own motives when others "add afflic-
tion to my bonds," even when they "preach Christ"? How
can Paul's attitude toward false members become mine?

CHRIST MAGNIFIED (Phil. 1:19, 20).
   To what evidence of Christ's intervention in his life could
Paul point as reason for his confidence in the positive result
of the Philippians' prayers (Phil. 1:19)? Acts 16:11-34.

   Paul's early experiences in Philippi had demonstrated be-
yond doubt that the Holy Spirit was working through him and
guarding him from demonic attacks. He had discovered through
experience that because of the "Spirit of Jesus" within, "I can
do all things in him who strengthens me" (Phil. 4:13, RSV).
Paul knew that the "Spirit of Jesus" would give him courage, a
holy boldness, to herald the glad tidings winsomely, regard-
less of consequences.
   How did Paul express the highest priority in his life? Phil.
1:20.

   Has anyone ever stated his or her philosophy of life in
clearer, more unselfish terms? Our Lord's longing desire is
that every believer breathe these words until every thought
and act spontaneously reflects this commitment.
   "When we submit ourselves to Christ, the heart is united
with His heart, the will is merged in His will, the mind be-
comes one with His mind, the thoughts are brought into cap-
tivity to Him; we live His life. This is what it means to be
clothed with the garment of His righteousness."—Christ's Ob-
ject Lessons, p. 312.
   Earnest expectation (Phil. 1:20, KJV) translates a Greek word
found elsewhere only in Romans 8:19. This word colorfully
depicts a person waiting with eager longing for that chief
object of his desire to come over the horizon.
   "Magnified" (KJV), more literally, "may be made great,"
"honored," or "glorified." After Paul and the other apostles
had preached Christ, this world would never lightly dismiss
the Man from Galilee. When a conceited, opinionated, proud
rabbi became a fearless, humble, magnanimous Paul, the apostle
of this crucified Nazarene, the whole world saw Jesus in a new
light. Truly Paul made Jesus great in the minds of others.

   In my daily life, how am I making Jesus great in the
 minds of those who know me?

Wednesday                                                July 6
"TO LIVE IS CHRIST" (Phil. 1:21-26).

  In what simple terms does Paul describe the secret of
genuine Christianity? How would you explain his meaning?
Phil. 1:21 (compare Col. 1:27; Gal. 2:20).


  What was Paul's attitude to death? Did he have a death
wish, even though continuing life had important challenges
and advantages? Phil. 1:22-26.


    Paul was torn between life and death, not because death
was to be preferred, but because, after the sleep of death, his
first conscious awareness would be that he was in Christ's
presence.
    "Those who assume that the Bible teaches a conscious state
in death use Philippians 1:23 as evidence that the Christian
enters into the presence of the Lord at the moment of death.
However, the New Testament uses the metaphor of sleep to
teach what happens at the moment of death."—George E. Rice,
A Living Hope (Boise, Idaho: Pacific Press, 1992), p. 92. (See
Matt. 27:52; 28:13; Luke 22:45; John 11:11, 12; Acts 7:60; 12:6;
13:36; 1 Cor. 7:39; 11:30; 15:6, 18, 20, 51; 1 Thess. 4:13, 14, 15;
2 Pet. 3:4.)
    Nine of the above references to death as sleep are in the
writings of Paul. The Greek verb to depart literally means "to
loose or undo again." It means preparation for departure, not
the act of departing itself. Classical Greek uses the word to
refer to hoisting an anchor or breaking camp. Paul uses it to
refer to death. Philippians 1:23 does not mention the lapse of
time between preparation for departure (death) and the actual
departure at the coming of the Lord. Nine other references in
Paul teach that a period of sleep separates the two experiences.
    Other events separated by time are spoken of in Scripture as
if they occurred simultaneously. It could be assumed on the
basis of Luke 24 that Jesus ascended to heaven on the same day
He rose from the dead. But Acts 1:3 tells us that He ascended
40 days after the resurrection. Also, John 5:29 speaks of two
resurrections—of life and damnation. But the text does not
mention that the two resurrections will be separated by 1,000
years. (See Rev. 20.) Likewise, Paul knew that his departure in
death (sleep) would be separated by time from his actually
being made alive in the presence of his Lord. He was unafraid
of the unconscious sleep of death because it will end by resur-
rection to immortality at the coming of Jesus.

LOYALTY TO CHRIST (Phil. 1:27-30).

   What information would be the highest form of compen-
sation for the weary Christian warrior in the Roman prison?
Phil. 1:27.


   "Conversation," KJV ("manner of life," RSV) may be trans-
lated literally as "behave as a citizen." Just as we should be
worthy citizens of whatever government we are under, Paul is
saying, so we should, above all else, behave as citizens of the
kingdom over which Jesus is Lord.
   Christianity is more than a matter of believing certain infor-
mation about Jesus; genuine Christians "walk in the light"
(1 John 1:7) and reflect the spirit and behavior of their Lord.
   "It is God's purpose to manifest through His people the
principles of His kingdom. That in life and character they may
reveal these principles, He desires to separate them from the
customs, habits, and practices of the world. . . . By beholding
the goodness, the mercy, the justice, and the love of God re-
vealed in His church, the world is to have a representation of
His character. And when the law of God is thus exemplified in
the life, even the world will recognize the superiority of those
who love and fear and serve God above every other people in
the world. . . . It is His purpose that by exemplifying the truth
in their lives, they shall be a praise in the earth. The grace of
Christ is sufficient to bring this about."—Counsels to Parents,
Teachers, and Students, pp. 321, 322.

  Why should Christians not shrink from the suffering in-
volved in making Christ known to others? Phil. 1:28-30.


  Paul has just expressed the hope that the Philippians will
"stand firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side
for the faith of the gospel" (Phil. 1:27, RSV). This passage
contains one of the clearest expressions of the Lord's desire for
His church to stand collectively and unitedly in witness. They
were not to wilt because of opposition (verse 28). In fact, the
opposition "is a clear omen . . . of your salvation" (RSV).
Suffering for Christ's sake is a special privilege (verse 29).

    "Of all the gifts that Heaven can bestow upon men,
 fellowship with Christ in His sufferings is the most weighty
 trust and the highest honor."—The Desire of Ages, p. 225.

                                                               21
Friday                                                  July 8
FURTHER STUDY: Read Psalm 69; "Caesar's Household" and
the last part of "Written From Rome" in The Acts of the Apostles,
pp. 461-468, 479-484.
    Christian witness, evangelical urgency, and missionary ef-
fectiveness are vital ingredients in the great commission given
to the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Paul's words "Only let
your manner of life be worthy of the gospel" (Phil. 1:27, RSV)
are as pertinent today as they were 1,900 years ago.
    "The world today is in crying need of a revelation of Christ
Jesus in the person of His saints. God desires that His people
shall stand before the world a holy people. Why?—because
there is a world to be saved by the light of gospel truth; and as
the message of truth that is to call men out of darkness into
God's marvelous light is given by the church, the lives of its
members, sanctified by the Spirit of truth, are to bear witness
to the verity of the messages proclaimed."—Testimonies to Min-
isters, p. 458.
 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Ask yourself: Does my manner of life have anything to
     do with the progress of the messages of the three an-
     gels in Revelation 14?
     2. You dearly wish to witness for Christ by using your
        own special talents, but you are timid because you feel
        overshadowed by others in the church. As you pray
        about the problem, what possibilities come to mind?
     3. You are a successful Sabbath School teacher, and you
        are conscious that another teacher is jealous of your
        influence. How does Paul's message in this week's
        lesson help you relate to the problem?
     4. A sick, aged member of your church, who is a faithful
        believer, confides in you that she wishes she could die.
        How would you minister to her need? How do Paul's
        words to the Philippians help you know what to say?
SUMMARY: Paul rejoiced at the progress of the gospel in
Rome, despite his imprisonment and despite the jealousy of
other evangelists. He viewed life with Christ as the only life
worth living. Although he saw advantages in death, he wished
to live so that he could visit Philippi again and minister to the
believers. He encouraged them and us to live exemplary lives
and to continue witnessing for Christ.

     NQW7       Hungary: Changed Land, Changed lives
                            by Pastor Laslo Csatami
           Hungary is a land that has seen changes that no earthly power
       can reverse. About three years ago God gave us an amazing op-
       portunity to preach the gospel in this formerly Communist land.
           Evangelists and local pastors are working together to reach
       as many hungry souls as possible.
           Szeged, a college town, lies near the border of Yugoslavia. About
       60,000 of the town's 200,000 residents are university students. We
       have a small church there with 28 members. They helped distribute
       1,000 posters and 45,000 invitations to the meetings. We adver-
       tised the meetings in the local newspaper.
           Lectures were held in the former Communist party building. We
       planned two meetings a day, but more than 2,000 came, and we had
       seats for only 700, so we decided to hold three meetings. Some
       offered to pay to attend; mothers begged us to provide child care
       so they could listen.
           One elderly lady had decided to attend with friends when
       she found the invitation in her mailbox. She was amazed at the
       warm welcome and astonishing Bible messages. She was
       among the first to be baptized. A schoolteacher, aware of her
       lack of understanding of the Bible, had begun to study the
       Bible with members of another faith. When she received the
       invitation to the meetings, she felt compelled to attend. "The
       lectures touched problems in my life. My family life is un-
       happy. I didn't have any joy in my life." Following the meet-
       ings she said, "I used to say that everything happens by
       chance. But now I can say that God directed the events this
       way. I am grateful to Him. My children grew up without
       hearing about God. Now I would like to speak about Him
       before it is too late. . . . The things I have seen and heard have
       strengthened me. What the Bible says is true." This teacher has
        since been baptized.
           The door of faith is open in Hungary. The harvest is
        plentiful, but the workers are few (see Matthew 9:37) in this
        land. We are grateful to God for inspiring our brothers and
        sisters in faraway lands to help evangelize in Hungary.

          "Countries hitherto closed to the gospel are opening their doors,
        and are pleading for the word of God to be explained to them.
        Kings and princes are opening their long-closed gates, inviting
        the heralds of the cross to enter. The harvest is truly great."

         Jesus, Our Example




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Phil. 2:1-11.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Let this mind be in you, which was also
     in Christ Jesus" (Philippians 2:5).
   KEY THOUGHT. When we honor Jesus as Lord and Sav-
iour, copying His example of love and humility, we will enjoy
unity of heart and mind with fellow believers and will be
credible witnesses to gospel truth.

   HAVING CHRIST'S MIND BRINGS UNITY. This week's
lesson is closely connected to last week's. The Philippians ap-
parently faced the same danger met by Christian congrega-
tions throughout history, the danger of spiritual rivalries and
doctrinal divisions (Phil. 2:2, 3).
   Paul knew that such strife was not born of the Spirit and
could destroy the credibility of Christianity. Thus he lifted his
readers in a soaring fourfold appeal (Phil. 2:1, 2) to unity,
humility, helpfulness, and Christlikeness.
   But he did not leave his appeal to mere exhortation. He
turned to the example of Jesus as the description and goal of
the Christians' behavior toward one another and toward
nonchurch members. The intensity of Philippians 2, its mind-
stretching, heart-tugging focus on the incredible cascade of
eternal love poured out in Jesus' becoming man, is unsur-
passed in religious literature.
   The well-being of the universe has been jeopardized by
those who from the beginning have thought that independent
judgment was more important than unity and deferment to
others.

UNITY OF MIND AND SPIRIT (Phil. 2:1, 2).

  How may a church member know that he or she is truly
experiencing a personal relationship with Jesus and the Holy
Spirit? Phil. 2:1, 2.


   Phillips paraphrases Philippians 2:1, 2: "Now if you have
known anything of Christ's encouragement and of his reassur-
ing love; if you have known something of the fellowship of his
Spirit, and of compassion and deep sympathy, do make my joy
complete—live together in harmony, live together in love, as
though you had only one mind and one spirit between you."
(Compare Phil. 1:27.)
   Paul desires more than doctrinal unity. Perhaps he per-
ceives that their missionary zeal may outrun their gracious-
ness and selflessness as they relate to one another. Paul lifts his
readers to Pisgah heights with his appeal illustrated by the life
of Jesus (Phil. 2:5-8).

   How should church members relate to those who differ
either in concepts or strategy? Compare Luke 12:51; John
7:12, 43 with 1 Cor. 1:10; 2 Cor. 13:11.

   "This does not teach that we should sacrifice our principles
of truth in order to be charitable; but that we should not be
unkind, uncourteous, harsh, and rough to those that are around
us. We should not push any away from us, but we should bind
them to our hearts with the tenderest words of love. Have we
not allowed serious faults to mar our characters?"—Ellen G.
White, Review and Herald, August 28, 1888.
   True unity of spirit and mind grows out of genuine humil-
ity—an unselfish spirit, a cooperative, helpful disposition. Only
the Holy Spirit can produce such people.

  How do these principles apply when Christians relate to
nonchurch members? John 17:21, 23; 1 Peter 3:15-17.

    "We need to be on guard continually lest we manifest
 the spirit of overbearing, criticism, and condemnation. We
 should seek to avoid the very appearance of evil, and not
 reveal anything like the attributes of Satan that will dis-
 hearten and discourge those with whom we come in con-
 tact. We are to work as did Christ—to draw, to build up, not
 to tear down."—Testimonies to Ministers, pp. 222, 223.

                                                                 25

VAINGLORY VERSUS HUMILITY (Phil. 2:3, 4).
   In 1847 an Edinburgh physician, Dr. James Simpson, dis-
covered that chloroform could be used to anesthetize people
during surgery. The discovery made him famous. Years later
one of his students at the University of Edinburgh asked him,
"What do you consider to be the most valuable discovery of
your lifetime?" Instead of referring to chloroform, Dr. Simpson
replied, "My most valuable discovery was when I discovered
myself a sinner and that Jesus Christ is my Saviour."
  How does Paul describe the behavior of a humble person?
Phil. 2:3, 4.

   "Strife" may be better translated "selfish ambition," and
"vainglory" as "vanity, conceit." Any group may appear uni-
fied. Such groups may even pass resolutions that give every
indication of unity. But unity is more than public consensus. If
a church, or any group, is "in full accord and of one mind"
(Phil. 2:2, RSV), its members will not be prompted by selfish
ambition or individually strive to be "number one." Selfish
ambition and conceit secrete the acid that eventually destroys
the public fabric of unity.
   Humility is often interpreted as weakness or cowardice. But
Christian humility does not make one less energetic, less aspir-
ing, or less efficient in his responsibilities. Because his mind is
not on selfish ambition, the humble person will devote more
thought and energy to the Lord's work.
   In what way does the humble person consider others "bet-
ter" than himself (Phil. 2:3)? Is a highly educated person
better than a less educated person? An experienced worker
better than a novice?

   Although Paul does not ask us to be blind and believe the
unbelievable, he does ask us to be honest with ourselves and
compassionate with others. Honesty compels us to recognize
our failures and mixed motives, freeing us to recognize the
rights and capabilities of others.
   Experience teaches us that truly humble people don't seem
to be aware of their humility. They are positive, constructive,
and joyful, not fawning, negative, or passive. (See Gospel
Workers, pp. 446, 447.)

THE MIND OF CHRIST (Phil. 2:5-7).

   How may the mind of Christ become ours (Phil. 2:5)?
1 Cor. 2:9-16. Is it possible for us truly to emulate Jesus'
victory over sin? 1 Peter 2:21; Rev. 3:21.


   For several verses Paul has emphasized the need for unity,
humility, and self-denial. Now he provides his readers with
their Example and thus the reason to believe that such unity
and humble self-denial is possible (Phil. 2:5). Paul does not
present our Lord's example as something that God could do
but human beings could not: "Let this mind be in you."
   "We need not place the obedience of Christ by itself as
something for which He was particularly adapted, by His par-
ticular divine nature. . . . Bear in mind that Christ's overcom-
ing and obedience is that of a true human being. In our conclu-
sions, we make many mistakes because of our erroneous views
of the human nature of our Lord. When we give, to His human
nature, a power that it is not possible for man to have in his
conflicts with Satan, we destroy the completeness of His hu-
manity. . . . He came not to our world to give the obedience of a
lesser God to a greater, but as a man to obey God's Holy Law,
and in this way He is our example."—Ellen G. White, Review
and Herald, June 17, 1976 (Ms. 1, 1892).
   In the area of character formation, New Testament writers
speak with one voice—Jesus is our example. (See Matt. 11:29;
John 13:12-17, 34;1 Cor. 11:1; 1 Thess. 1:6; 1 Peter 2:21-23; 1 John
2:6.)

   What did Christ's gracious mind-set lead Him to do? Phil.
2:6, 7.


   The Revised Standard Version translates verse 6: "Who,
though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with
God a thing to be grasped." During the incarnation, Christ
retained His full deity, His equality with the Father (John 5:18;
8:58; 14:9). But, in the battle with sin, He was willing to lay
aside the exercise of His divine powers so that He could be our
example. Even so, He used His divine powers to forgive sin
(Matt. 9:2), heal the sick (Matt. 9:6), and raise the dead (John
11:25, 42-44).
   Though He was God, Jesus took on the disadvantages and
weaknesses of humanity to demonstrate that dependent hu-
man beings may reflect the mind of God.
                                                                  27

THE WILLING SERVANT (Phil. 2:7, 8).
  Christ made "himself of no reputation" (Phil. 2:7, KJV).
He "emptied himself" (RSV). According to Phil. 2:7, in what
sense did Christ empty Himself?

   The Greek translates literally, "But He emptied Himself,
taking the form of a slave." In becoming man, God limited
Himself, emptied Himself of certain prerogatives, and placed
Himself at great risk. Truly we stand before a great mystery
that will occupy our thoughts and gratitude for eternity.
   "As one with us, a sharer in our needs and weaknesses, He
was wholly dependent upon God."—The Desire of Ages, p. 363.
    "The apostle is saying that Christ emptied Himself and
took on the essential attributes of a slave. As a slave's out-
standing characteristic is that of rendering unquestioning obedi-
ence, so as a man the Son undertook to render obedience to the
Father (. . . Heb. 5:8)."
   "The humanity of the Son of God is everything to us. It is
the golden chain that binds our souls to Christ, and through
Christ to God. This is to be our study. Christ was a real man;
He gave proof of His humility in becoming a man. Yet He was
God in the flesh. . . . We should come to this study with the
humility of a learner, with a contrite heart. And the study of
the incarnation of Christ is a fruitful field, which will repay the
searcher who digs deep for hidden truth."—Selected Messages,
book 1, p. 244.
  What is the significance of Christ's self-denial and obedi-
ence? Phil. 2:8.

   In verse 3 Paul appealed to the Philippians to have "lowli-
ness of mind"—a humility that counted others better than
oneself. In verse 8 Paul reverently pointed to Jesus as their
example of Christian humility. Many will be obedient and
persevering, up to a point. But Jesus has shown us that obedi-
ence is nothing if it does not follow through, even "unto death."
   But Christ's obedience unto death was more than an ex-
ample. His death was my death and yours—a death befitting
those who have loved darkness rather than light. "The wages
of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus
Christ our Lord" (Rom. 6:23).

JESUS EXALTED AND WORSHIPED (Phil. 2:9-11).
   What connection is there between Christ's example of self-
denial and the fact that He is Lord of all, saints and sinners
alike? Phil. 2:9-11.


   At Christ's ascension "God exalted him to the highest place
and gave him the name that is above every name" (Phil. 2:9,
NIV). What a magnificent triumph for the Son of God! The
Creator of the universe, equal with the Father in authority and
power, with infinite love and humility prostrated Himself be-
fore the inhabitants of heaven and earth. Human sin demanded
a divine-human sacrifice. God's love and justice demanded,
not only His complete restoration, but, in view of His unique
condescension, unprecedented exaltation.
   How delightfully appropriate! The Father had proclaimed
through the prophet Isaiah: "Therefore I will give him a por-
tion among the great, and he will divide the spoils with the
strong, because he poured out his life unto death, and was
numbered with the transgressors. For he bore the sin of many,
and made intercession for the transgressors" (Isa. 53:12, NIV).

   Why is it especially fitting for all God's created beings to
offer adoring worship of Jesus Christ? Phil. 2:7, 8, 10; Heb.
1:3-13.


   It was entirely fitting that, in the presence of his risen Lord,
Thomas should exclaim, "My Lord and my God" (John 20:28).
It was fitting that Stephen, bruised and bleeding, should cry
out, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit" (Acts 7:59). It is equally
proper that, when we bow to pray, we address Jesus directly
and express our adoration and gratitude. "It is by communion
with Him, daily, hourly—by abiding in Him—that we are to
grow in grace."—Steps to Christ, p. 69.
   In Philippians 2:9-11 Paul gives us an insight into the clos-
ing scenes of the great controversy: "As if entranced, the wicked
have looked upon the coronation of the Son of God. . . . They
witness the outburst of wonder, rapture, and adoration from
the saved; . . . all with one voice exclaim, 'Great and marvelous
are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways,
thou King of saints,' (Revelation 15:3) and, falling prostrate,
they worship the Prince of life."—The Great Controversy, pp.
668-671.

                                                                29
Friday                                                 July 15
FURTHER STUDY: Study the Bible theme of the humiliation
and exaltation of Jesus. (1) He stepped down from glory and
became man: Matt. 1:1; Gal. 4:4; 1 John 4:2. (2) He was exalted
again to His former position of glory and honor. Because of the
cross, He is given even greater praise than before: John 17:5;
Mark 16:19; Luke 22:69; Eph. 1:20; Rev. 5:12; 1 Tim. 3:16. Read
"God With Us" and "Who Is the Greatest?" in The Desire of
Ages, pp. 19-26; 432-439, and "In Humility and Faith" in Testi-
monies, vol. 9, pp. 270-276.
   "In consideration of this [Christ's sacrifice], can men have
one particle of exaltation? As they trace down the life and
sufferings and humiliation of Christ, can they lift their proud
heads as though they were to bear no trials, no shame, no
humiliation? I say to the followers of Christ, Look to Calvary,
and blush for shame at your self-important ideas. All this
humiliation of the Majesty of heaven was for guilty, condemned
man. . . . All this was for you who are striving for the su-
premacy—striving for human praise, for human exaltation;
you who are afraid you will not receive all that deference, that
respect from human minds, that you think is your due. Is this
Christlike? . .. He died to make an atonement, and to become a
pattern for every one who would be His disciple."—Ellen G.
White, Review and Herald, July 5, 1887.
 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How would you apply Paul's counsel to "count others
     better than yourselves" (Phil. 2:3, RSV) when someone
     is given a church position you would like to have?
     2. What did Paul mean when he wrote: "Let each of you
        look not only to his own interests, but also to the inter-
        ests of others" (Phil. 2:4, RSV)? (Compare Isa. 58:7;
        Acts 20:35; Rom. 15:1; Gal. 6:2; Heb. 13:3.)
     3. If your next-door neighbors are not Christian be-
        lievers, how can you demonstrate to them the superior-
        ity of Christ's character?
SUMMARY: Paul instructs the Philippians and us to practice
unity, love, humility, and benevolence. Christ's willingness to
step down from the courts of glory, becoming a man, bearing
our sin, and paying the price for our redemption, is the great-
est example of the principles that Paul wishes us to grasp.

Mahal AlLssitim
     N-liw Global Mission Targets the Affluent
                                   Victor Marley

            I was apprehensive as I left the tranquil campus of Newbold
         College and drove the 50 miles south to the affluent Royal Tunbridge
         Wells in the heart of the English countryside. It hardly seemed like
         a Global Mission field, but this home to 3/4 million people had no
         Adventist presence.
            My task as a theology graduate was to assist with the planting
         of a church in the Tunbridge Wells area. This would be a daunting
         assignment anywhere, but affluent people often do not want to
         see the relevance of God in their lives, and one could wonder
         whether the months of work that stretched ahead would be of any
         use at all.
            I began my work by making door-to-door contacts and study-
         ing with those who wished to know more of God. Two Daniel
         seminars and a stress seminar increased interest in my work.
         Through these avenues of witness, a house church was
         started with up to nine people attending weekly.
            The work was difficult. However, I found that my growing
         relationship with God helped me overcome discouragement,
         and I was grateful for my Christian faith and the instruction I
         had received in college.
             During the nine months I was in Tunbridge Wells, I
         learned that people wanted to know not only what I be-
         lieved, but why. Sometimes I could not answer immediately,
         but I was grateful for the professors who challenged me to
         examine my faith and to think through these issues for
         myself and come to conclusions based on God's Word.
             Throughout my involvement in this Global Mission project,
         friends encouraged me and prayed for my success. This has been
         a tremendous experience. The house group that began there is
         continuing, and I am confident that, through the grace of God, this
         will grow into a much larger ministry in the future.

                           ology. He returned from Tunbridge Wells to
                           do postgraduate study at Newbold College. He
                           hopes to be able to enter full-time ministry.

         Jesus, the Source of
           Righteousness



Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Phil. 2:12-3:11.

     MEMORY TEXT: "And be found in him, not having mine
     own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is
     through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of
     God by faith" (Philippians 3:9).

   KEY THOUGHT: Because we depend on Christ's righteous-
ness and His work in our hearts, rather than on our own efforts
to save ourselves, we have the assurance of progressive spirit-
ual growth toward the goal the Lord has set for us.

   GOD WORKS IN US TOWARD A SPECIFIC GOAL. His
"good pleasure" (Phil. 2:13) is to replace sin in our lives by His
righteous presence. When God created the universe, the circle
of love was His "good pleasure," and when it was broken by
Satan's selfish rebellion, the peace and security of the universe
were in jeopardy.
   But God devised the plan of salvation, in which He would
take the initiative in meeting sin and its originator head-on.
Jesus thus is called the Lamb of God who "taketh away the sin
of the world" (John 1:29). His name is Jesus, "for he shall save
his people from their sins" (Matt. 1:21).
   God's purpose in the plan of salvation is to destroy sin by
drawing sinners to Himself. He speaks gracious words and
offers pardon and probation, over and over again. He offers
His power and holiness through the inward action of the Holy
Spirit. Whatever is needed to combat the presence and power
of sin and enable us to grow more like Christ, God offers to all.

GOD WORKS (Phil. 2:12, 13).

   What is the Christian's responsibility in the salvation proc-
ess? Phil. 2:12.

   Paul's "wherefore" indicates that Christ's life of obedience
and self-denial (Phil. 2:5-11) is the Christian's pattern and ex-
ample. Paul's thought in verse 12 is linked with his thought in
verse 5: "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ
Jesus." He hopes that Christ's example will motivate us to be
joyfully obedient and to cooperate with His work for others.
   When Paul says, "Work out your own salvation," he is not
promoting salvation by works. Salvation is by grace, through
faith (Rom. 3:20-24, 28; Eph. 2:8, 9). But grace is both the moti-
vation and the power for good works (Eph. 2:10; Rom. 6:11-16).
God approves righteous works that are the outworking of His
grace in the heart (1 Cor. 1:4-7; Rom. 6:18; 2 Cor. 6:1).
   Effort to obey Christ is an evidence of faith. (See Heb. 12:4.)
Victory is God's gift of grace, but wills are involved in con-
stantly choosing His will. Many are willing to accept salvation
as long as there are no conditions. But the Bible is clear: by faith
we must "strive to enter in" (Luke 13:24); "put off the old man"
(Col. 3:9); "lay aside every weight," "run with patience" (Heb.
12:1); "resist the devil" (James 4:7); "endure unto the end"
(Matt. 24:13).

   How does God become the source of the Christian's salva-
tion? Phil. 2:13.

   "Worketh" emphasizes the fact that God is the source of our
salvation and our power to obey. God puts forth power in the
believer's life and in the Christian community, so that His
people are able to do His "good pleasure." (See Jude 24.)
   "Both to will and to do." God's will to save leads Him to
bring conviction to our hearts. When we accept His salvation,
He wills to work in us to bring our lives into accord with His
divine purpose. Thus, He enables us "to walk, even as he
walked" (1 John 2:6).
   Jesus taught the same truth (John 15:1-10). "The sinner
 unites his weakness to Christ's strength, his emptiness to
 Christ's fullness, his frailty to Christ's enduring might.
 Then he has the mind of Christ."—The Desire of Ages, p.
675.

                                                                  33

SHINE AS LIGHTS (Phil. 2:14-30).

  How does Paul describe the Christian witness of those
who permit God to work out His will in them? Phil. 2:14-16.


   God makes Christians "blameless and pure, children of God
without fault" (Phil. 2:15, NIV) when they trust Him. This
process is known as sanctification. Instead of grudging and
grumbling obedience (verse 14), sanctification includes "the
cheerful performance of daily duties in perfect obedience to
the will of God."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 360.

  Note the meanings and other uses of the words by which
Paul describes what Christ does for the totally committed
Christian (Phil. 2:15):
  Blameless (faultless): Luke 1:6; 1 Thess. 3:13.

     Harmless (pure, innocent): Matt. 10:16; Rom. 16:19.

  Without rebuke (unblemished, blameless): Eph. 1:4; 5:27;
Col. 1:22; 1 Peter 1:19; Jude 24; Rev. 14:5.

   Christ's standard for His people throughout history is iden-
tical to His standard at the end of time. The blameless spiritual
condition of those who receive the end-time seal of God (Rev.
14:5) is the condition to which Christians in every era were to
strive—not in their own strength, but by total reliance upon
and submission to Christ. Paul describes the goal for all Chris-
tians, a goal that may be reached by the indwelling grace of
God. From the standpoint of external behavior, the Christian
should be blameless; from the standpoint of God's all-seeing
eye, the Christian's motives should be unmixed with evil.
   "Lights in the world" (Phil. 2:15; see also Matt. 5:14). In the
transformation of His people, God sets forth to the world and
universe the spirit of His kingdom. (See The Desire of Ages, p.
307.)

   What examples of total commitment to Christ did Paul
give the Philippians? Phil. 2:17, 19-22, 25-30.


  Paul and his fellow workers shone as "lights in the world."
They were willing to risk their lives to make Christ known.
Their devotion to Christ revealed itself in love for the lost—an
example for the Philippian church.

CONFIDENCE IN THE FLESH (Phil. 3:1-6).

   Why do you think Paul repeatedly referred to his own
rejoicing and urged his fellow Christians to rejoice? See Phil.
3:1 (compare 1:18; 2:16-18, 28; 3:3; 4:4).


  What kind of people did Paul urge the Philippians to
watch out for? Why? Phil. 3:2, 3.


   "Those who mutilate the flesh" (Phil. 3:2 RSV) were the
Judaizers who taught that, to be saved, Gentile Christians should
be circumcised. The epistles to the Romans and the Galatians
provided an effective answer to this class. Paul explained that,
even though obedience to the Ten Commandments is an essen-
tial evidence of salvation by grace (Rom. 3:31; 8:3, 4), we are
not made right with God by attempting to obey any law (Gal.
2:16). Moreover, now that Christ has come, ceremonial ob-
servances pointing forward to Christ are no longer binding.
(See Eph. 2:13-16.)

  Where had Paul placed his confidence for salvation before
he became a Christian? Phil. 3:4-6.


   Paul was the right person to answer the Judaizers. He not
only had made Jesus Christ his Saviour and Lord, he also
could boast (if he wanted to) that he had done everything that
the Judaizers said was necessary to salvation.
   Paul simply made clear to the Judaizers that they had missed
the point of circumcision: salvation rests on one's personal
relationship with God, which leads to real freedom—freedom
from the "works of the flesh" (Gal. 5:19), freedom from the
"yoke of bondage" (Gal. 5:1) under which Paul had felt "blame-
less." "In Christ," however, salvation is not achieved by exter-
nalizing any law, ritual or moral.
   Legalism in essence is any religious practice or way of thinking
that attempts to gain or maintain God's favor and salvation
through our behavior. Religious ritualism or any theory of
redemption that rejects Christ's atonement on the cross and
the injunction to "be holy yourselves in all your conduct"
(1 Peter 1:15, RSV) tries to storm the gate of heaven without
letting Jesus truly save His people (Matt. 1:21). We must allow
Christ to reign in our hearts and allow the law to point us to
Him.
                                                                35

TWO METHODS IN CONTRAST (Phil. 3:7-9).

   Why was it necessary for Paul to suffer "the loss of all
things" (Phil. 3:7, 8)? Compare Matt. 19:16-22.


   Comparing and contrasting Paul before his conversion and
the rich young ruler is an interesting exercise. Both thought
that their outward observance of the law was the means of
their salvation. Jesus asked the ruler to give up all his wealth
and become one of His disciples. Jesus asked Paul to give up
fame, honor, and fortune to become the apostle to the Gentiles.
The ruler refused; Paul obeyed. The ruler rejected salvation by
grace; Paul accepted it. Christ asks us to renounce only those
relationships and advantages that stand in the way of our
salvation and threaten to hamper the work He has for us.

   How does Paul contrast two methods by which men and
women have sought salvation? Phil. 3:9 (compare Rom. 9:30-
10:4).


   "By 'righteousness' we shall see that Paul means both 'justi-
fication' and 'sanctification.' "—A. T. Robertson, Word Pictures
in the New Testament (Nashville: Broadman Press, 1931), vol. 4,
p. 327.
   Perhaps no one ever sought righteousness more vigorously
than Saul the Pharisee, or Paul the man "in Christ." But Paul
discovered that sincerity is not enough.
   "A righteousness of my own, based on law" (Phil. 3:9, RSV)
refers to Paul's attempt to earn righteousness from God by
obedience to His law. Paul's failure in this quest paralleled the
failure of his countrymen. "Israel who pursued the righteous-
ness which is based on law did not succeed in fulfilling that
law" (Rom. 9:31, RSV). The Gentile Christians found right-
eousness because they sought it by faith in Christ (verse 30).
The righteousness of Christ was credited to them (Rom. 4:5)
and bestowed upon them by the Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:9-17).


   "He [God] did not leave us to retain our defects and
deformities of character, or to serve Him as best we could
in the corruption of our sinful nature. He has made provi-
sion that we may be complete in His Son, not having our
own righteousness, but the righteousness of Christ."—Ellen
G. White, Review and Herald, March 18, 1902.

Thursday                                             July 21
LIFE'S HIGHEST PRIORITIES (Phil. 3:10,11).

  What were Paul's highest priorities? Phil. 3:10 (first part).


   Paul knew much about God before he became a Christian,
but that was largely intellectual knowledge, a theological
understanding. When he experienced faith, he came to know
God through Jesus in a personal way. If a person is gracious,
honest, and loving, the one who discovers these qualities never
seems to feel that he or she knows enough about that person.
When that Person is your Creator and Saviour, the desire to
know Him better knows no limits. This insatiable desire to
know Jesus better is the result of a genuine experience of
righteousness by faith. (See verse 9.) Knowing Christ means
allowing Him to live out His life through us (Gal. 2:20).
   "Power of his resurrection. Paul was not merely wanting to
get acquainted with the power that effected Christ's resurrec-
tion; he longed for that power to operate in him also. For this
wish to be fulfilled Paul knew he would have to live a life like
Christ's. Hence he is virtually expressing the desire to have the
same sin-conquering power in his life that Christ had in
His. . . . The same power that raised Jesus from the dead is
needed to resurrect a sinner dead in his sins, and to re-create
him in the divine image."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p.
168.

   Why did Paul wish to share Christ's sufferings? Phil. 3:10
(last part), 11.


   As genuine Christians through the centuries have dis-
covered, a deep friendship with Jesus gives us power to over-
come sinful tendencies. That friendship also makes us aware
that commitment leads to suffering for Christ's sake. "Indeed
all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be perse-
cuted" (2 Tim. 3:12, RSV). Jesus showed us the cost of truth—
from childhood to Calvary. Paul also had learned the joy that
arises in self-denial and the special peace that compensates for
suffering for righteousness' sake. (See Matt. 5:10.)


    Has someone discriminated against you because of your
 religious faith? How did you react? How would you recom-
 mend that we deal with such discrimination?


                                                               37

   FURTHER STUDY: On the importance of "the righteous-
ness from God that depends on faith" (Phil. 3:9, RSV), study
the following passages: Rom. 3:20-31; Gal. 2:16-3:3, 14.
   Read portions of "Growing Up Into Christ" in Steps to Christ,
pp. 69-75; "Working for the Intemperate" in The Ministry of
Healing, pp. 174-177; "Two Worshipers" in Christ's Object Les-
sons, pp. 150-163.
   "We have transgressed the law of God, and by the deeds of
the law shall no flesh be justified. The best efforts that man in
his own strength can make, are valueless to meet the holy and
just law that he has transgressed; but through faith in Christ he
may claim the righteousness of the Son of God as all-sufficient.
Christ satisfied the demands of the law in His human nature.
He bore the curse of the law for the sinner, made an atonement
for him, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish,
but have everlasting life. Genuine faith appropriates the right-
eousness of Christ, and the sinner is made an overcomer with
Christ; for he is made a partaker of the divine nature, and thus
divinity and humanity are combined."—Selected Messages, book
1, pp. 363, 364.
 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. When is the effort to be "blameless and innocent, chil-
     dren of God without blemish" (Phil. 2:15, RSV), not an
     attempt to earn righteousness by works? Under what
     circumstances would such an effort be legalism?
     2. Why is true Sabbath observance not an example of
        "righteousness under the law" (Phil. 3:6, RSV)? What
        is the relationship between Sabbath observance and
        righteousness by faith?
     3. A friend feels that becoming a Christian would in-
        volve giving up too much. He is unable to join Paul,
        who "suffered the loss of all things" (Phil. 3:8). How
        would you answer him?
SUMMARY: Because God works in us, we are able to live
blameless lives and to "shine as lights in the world" (Phil.
2:15). By turning away from legalistic methods of achieving
righteousness and by trusting fully in "the righteousness from
God that depends on faith" (Phil. 3:9, RSV), Christ empowers
us to press on toward the goal of complete victory by union
with Him.

       5ER7                  James and Carol Bahr*
                                     Part 1
            Not all mission-story miracles involve raising up a church or
         even the first baptisms. Often just becoming a missionary is a
         miracle in itself.
            James Bahr* was a young man with a promising career in
         international banking. But he wanted more; he wanted his life to
         make a difference for eternity. While attending the General Con-
         ference session in Indianapolis in 1990, James was challenged by
         the newly established Global Mission program to "adopt"
         through prayer a specific people group who had never
         heard of Jesus. His "adopted" people were the Rupam* of
         Central India. From that moment on, India and the needs
         of the people of Rupam burned in his heart.
            James began reading about India: its history, culture,
         and religions. He prayed that God would send laborers to
         tell the people of Rupam of His love, and he gave offerings
         to hasten evangelization of "his" people.
            James began working with the van ministries program in New
         York City as accountant and van worker. There he met Carol,
         another volunteer worker, who had spent part of her life in the
         mission field. Together they prayed for India and Rupam. As they
         shared their love for India, they discovered their love for each
         other, and were married. Their prayers that God would send a
         missionary became prayers that if it was God's will, He would
         open the door for them to go.
            In faith the young couple decided to go to India to "spy out
         the land." They made their airline reservations and prayed that
         God would lead them. Shortly before they left, word came that
         riots had broken out and had spread across India. Was it wise
         to go now? They prayed far into the night for a sign. God
         showed James two verses in Esther-1:1 and 8:9. There was his
         answer! The only two times in the entire Bible that India was
         named, and God had shown them to him. They were going!
           In India, with a population of more than 900 million, fewer than
         one in 5,000 are Seventh-day Adventist Christians.

            * James and Carol Bahr are fictional names for real people. The
         name of the specific city has been changed, as well, to protect the
         Bahrs and the work they are seeking to establish there, since the
         area in which they serve is anti-Christian.

       Our Goal for Growth




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Phil. 3:12-21.
     MEMORY TEXT: "Not that I have already obtained this or
     am already perfect; but I press on to make it my own,
     because Christ Jesus has made me his own" (Philippians
     3:12, RSV).
   KEY THOUGHT: Christians who have the assurance of
present salvation in Christ press on toward the goal of com-
plete spiritual victory, with the ultimate hope of immortality at
the second coming of Jesus.
   THERE IS NO LIMIT TO SPIRITUAL GROWTH. Last
week we heard Paul tell the world that Jesus Christ had be-
come the answer to all his "striving" to be right with God.
Pardon, power, spiritual victory, all come through a personal
relationship with Jesus. This relationship is called faith.
   This week we find Paul saying that he has not learned all
there is to know about Jesus, nor has he attained all the Chris-
tian growth into which Jesus wants to lead him. One of his
great concerns is that he and fellow believers should maintain
the fellowship with Christ they have already enjoyed. There is
more to the Christian life than starting well.
   Paul held up a high standard for himself, as well as for
others. On one hand he believed that the inward power of God
could keep men and women from sinning. On the other, he
knew that there is no top limit to believers' growth in grace
and knowledge as they are led to reflect God's glory.

Sunday                                                July 24
A GOAL NOT YET ACHIEVED (Phil. 3:12).

  What was it that Paul had not yet obtained to which he
was earnestly pressing forward? Phil. 3:12.


   Verse 12 refers to verses 10 and 11. Paul did not yet "know
him, and the power of his resurrection" perfectly. Paul antici-
pated "becoming like him in his death" (Phil. 3:10, RSV) and
rising from the dead as Jesus did. He had not yet attained all
this, nor had he been ultimately perfected spiritually (verse
12). He was being progressively sanctified, hoping to seize the
prize—ultimate eternal salvation.

   If Paul was not yet perfect (Phil. 3:12), how could he write,
"Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded"
(verse 15)? Compare 1 John 2:5; 4:12; Col. 2:10.


   Philippians 3:12 uses the Greek verb meaning "to perfect,
bring to an end, finish, accomplish." Verse 15 uses the related
adjective meaning "perfect, having attained the end or pur-
pose, complete, full-grown, mature, fully developed." Because,
by faith, the thief on the cross had received Christ's perfection,
he was complete, perfect in Christ—qualified for heaven in the
sense intended in Philippians 3:15. If he had gone on living
and believing, he would have developed progressively toward
the spiritual perfection to which Paul refers in Philippians
3:12.

   Study the following texts that translate either the Greek
verb to perfect or the adjective perfect. Note that they teach:
   1. Present completeness in Christ: 1 Cor. 2:6; 14:20; 2 Cor.
12:9; Col. 4:12; Heb. 5:14; 10:14; 12:23.
   2. Victory over sin as the believer's goal: Matt. 5:48; Eph.
4:13; Col. 1:28; James 1:4; 3:2.


   Present perfection in Christ, being "complete in him" (Col.
2:10) at this moment, does not rule out the importance of
constant spiritual growth. Even though in Christ we have vic-
tory over sin at this moment (1 John 5:4), we are constantly
moving toward the experience of the uninterrupted victory
that Jesus knew (Rev. 3:21; Phil. 1:6; 3:21).

                                                                41

ONE THING I DO (Phil. 3:13).

  Because we have received Christ's saving grace, how should
we relate to our past sins and mistakes? Phil. 3:13.


   Paul had much to forget—the guilt of former days. When
Jesus forgives our sins (1 John 1:9), lifts our guilt from us, and,
because of the cross, destroys it completely (Micah 7:19), we
must rejoice with Paul, "forgetting what lies behind" (Phil.
3:13, RSV). Then, with abandon, we can "spring toward the
tape for the prize of the heavenly calling from God in Christ
Jesus" (verse 14, Yeager, Renaissance New Testament, vol. 14, p.
481).
   "The language of the soul should be that of joy and grati-
tude. If we have dark chapters in our experience, let us not
keep their memory fresh by repetition. Forgetting the things
that are behind, let us press forward to the things that are
before. Cultivate only those thoughts and feelings which pro-
duce gratitude and praise. If you have been wronged, forget it,
and think only of the great mercy, the loving-kindness, the
inexpressible love of Jesus."—Ellen G. White, Signs of the Times,
September 27, 1883.

  How strenuous should be our efforts to reach the goal
Christ has set for us? Phil. 3:13.


    "Straining forward" (Phil. 3:13, RSV) translates a Greek word
that describes the athlete in rigorous pursuit of his goal. "Man
is to cooperate with God, employing every power according to
his God-given ability. He is not to be ignorant as to what are
right practices in eating and drinking, and in all the habits of
life. The Lord designs that His human agents shall act as ra-
tional, accountable beings in every respect. . . . Let no man
present the idea that man has little or nothing to do in the great
work of overcoming: for God does nothing for man without
his cooperation."—Selected Messages, book 1, pp. 380, 381.
    Professed Christians are miserable when part of their life is
governed by biblical principles and part by worldly principles.
If God does not have all of our life, the question remains as to
whether He really has any of it. "If He is not Lord of all, He is
not Lord at all." When we are not totally consecrated to the
will of God in all aspects of life on which we have light, the
malignancy of selfishness will make darkness appear to be
light.

OUR HIGHEST CALLING (Phil. 3:14).
  What was Paul's greatest incentive to keep pressing on
even though adversities were many? Phil. 3:14.

   Salvation is a gift from beginning to end, and those who
accept it "strain forward" and "press on," joyfully trusting in
Jesus for pardon and power.
   From the Damascus Road to the Roman dungeon and the
executioner's ax, Paul "was not disobedient unto the heavenly
vision" (Acts 26:19). The "goal" was always Jesus Christ and
His service. At the end of life he could say, "I have fought a
good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith"
(2 Tim. 4:7), all the while using every opportunity "that I might
by all means save some" (1 Cor. 9:22).
   "Goal" (Phil. 3:14, RSV) emphasizes the object of Paul's
striving through the power of the Holy Spirit to become more
like Christ; "prize" focuses on the reward, the spiritual com-
pensation, the continuing gifts to the faithful who keep their
eye single to God.
  How does the Epistle to the Hebrews expand the thought
expressed by Paul to the Philippians? Heb. 12:1, 2.

   "Let us run . . . with patience, our eyes fixed on Jesus the
source and the goal of our faith" (verses 1, 2, Phillips).
   Jesus was to Paul "the fulness of God" (Col. 1:19, RSV), the
"pioneer and perfecter of our faith" (Heb. 12:2, RSV). Christ is
the revelation of what God is like and what real humanity may
be like when fully dependent upon God for strength. Paul saw
that only Jesus gave sense and purpose to life.
   "In Him was found the perfect ideal. To reveal this ideal as
the only true standard for attainment; to show what every
human being might become; what, through the indwelling of
humanity by divinity, all who received Him would become—
for this, Christ came to the world. He came to show how men
are to be trained as befits the sons of God; how on earth they
are to practice the principles and to live the life of heaven."
—Education, pp. 73, 74.

    Is fixing our eyes on Jesus and doing His bidding legal-
 ism? Why, or why not?

                                                               43
Wednesday                                             July 27
PATTERNS TO LIVE BY (Phil. 3:17-19).

   How seriously did Paul regard personal influence? Phil.
3:17.


     Paul did not bask in contrived humility. He was too honest
to join those who sought admiration from others in declaring
their great wretchedness. He knew the peace and strength that
come from walking with Jesus. His hearers understood well
the source of his fortitude and love. To the Corinthians he
declared, "Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ" (1 Cor. 11:1,
RSV). To the Thessalonians he wrote, "You became imitators
of us . . . so that you became an example to all the believers in
Macedonia" (1 Thess. 1:6, 7, RSV).
    The influence of the gospel is greatly increased when the
believer's personal life witnesses to its power and hope. When
a message of cheer, hope, and love is accompanied by a win-
some, courageous life of loving witness, unbelievers are at-
tracted to Christ. To fulfill the gospel commission, Christians
must walk what they talk.
    "Paul carried with him the atmosphere of heaven. All who
associated with him felt the influence of his union with Christ.
The fact that his own life exemplified the truth he proclaimed,
gave convincing power to his preaching. Here lies the power
of the truth. The unstudied, unconscious influence of a holy
life is the most convincing sermon that can be given in favor of
Christianity. Argument, even when unanswerable, may pro-
voke only opposition; but a godly example has a power that it
is impossible wholly to resist."—Gospel Workers, p. 59.

     What reduced Paul to tears? Phil. 3:18, 19.


   What a striking contrast these verses depict with what has
gone before. Instead of glorying in the cross, these enemies of
Christ gloried in their shameful way of life. Instead of exalting
Christ as the source of their only hope, they deified their appe-
tites. Instead of focusing their minds on the heavenly goal,
they groveled in the mire of earth. No wonder Paul wept!

   Do we weep and pray for our loved ones who are outside
of Christ? How can we develop a genuine burden for souls?
   What can we do for friends and family who do not know
Christ?

WE AWAIT A SAVIOUR (Phil. 3:20, 21).
  What great event cast a bright light upon all that Paul
thought or did? Phil. 3:20, 21.

   Christians respond to Jesus reaching out to them. With Paul,
they are constantly aware that Jesus is the goal of life, the only
prize worth considering as they face the future!
   What happens to Christians when Jesus returns? He will
transform their bodies so that they will have a body like His!
An incredible promise, beyond adequate words to describe!
Christians can look forward to having incorruptible bodies
(1 Cor. 15:42-49) such as Jesus has had since His resurrection.
They will have the ability to travel through space, never again
to feel the deterioration of age or sickness.
  What will be the spiritual state of those who welcome
Jesus at His second advent? Compare Rev. 7:1-3 with 14:1, 5.

   There is one thing that the Lord cannot do for us when He
comes; He cannot at that time give us holy characters. If changed
at all, our characters will be transformed before death or, for
the last generation, before the Lord comes. To wait for a change
of character after one dies or is translated is one of the subtle
and deadly insinuations of the master deceiver.
   "When He comes He is not to cleanse us of our sins, to
remove from us the defects in our characters, or to cure us of
the infirmities of our tempers and dispositions. If wrought for
us at all, this work will all be accomplished before that time.
When the Lord comes, those who are holy will be holy still. . . .
But those who are unjust, unsanctified, and filthy will remain
so forever. No work will then be done for them to remove their
defects and give them holy characters. The Refiner does not
then sit to pursue His refining process and remove their sins
and their corruption. This is all to be done in these hours of
probation. It is now that this work is to be accomplished for
us."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 355.

 sermon in Philippians 3, what would you say?

    In discussing the Bible doctrine of perfection, it is important
to emphasize the distinction between imperfection and sin. All
sin is imperfection, but not all imperfection is sin. God did not
regard the imperfect works that the Jews were committing as
sin until Jesus had given them greater light. (See John 15:22,
24.) "Whatever does not proceed from faith is sin" (Rom. 14:23,
RSV). The Bible means by perfection a life lived in such close fellow-
ship with Christ that the believer is not committing sin. But because
the same believer retains an imperfect mind and body, his or
her deeds are always imperfect—until "this corruptible" puts
on "incorruption," and "this mortal" puts on "immortality"
(1 Cor. 15:53).
    Those who raise the fear of "perfectionism" in this life are
guarding against the error of "holy flesh"—the age-old heresy
wherein the believer supposedly is no longer tempted to evil—
even from within—and thus can no longer sin. This rejection of
"perfectionism" is a Christian's duty.
    On the other hand, those who guard the truth of biblical
perfection do not teach that God expects a believer to reach a
state of no human imperfection and no need for growth in this
life. They define perfection in moral terms only (Christ's Object
Lessons, p. 330), with love and pure intent being its simplest
description (Rom. 13:10; Matt. 22:37-40). Through Christ, sin
may be overcome, though temptations to sin and the need to
grow do indeed remain.

    DISCUSSION QUESTION: Your friend is a new believer,
 recently baptized. But she is inclined to repudiate her faith
 and return to the life she once knew. How would you
 present this week's passage of Scripture (Philippians 3:12-
21) to inspire her to continue in the Christian walk?

SUMMARY: Although Paul speaks of believers as enjoying
present perfection in Christ, he states his firm determination to
press on toward the goal of ultimate spiritual perfection. The
reward for believers who emulate Jesus is glorification at the
coming of Jesus.

                              James and Carol Bahr*
                                      Part 2

           James and Carol Bahr were determined to serve God. They had
        prayed for guidance, and God had directed them. Now they were
        on their way to the land of their prayers: Rupam, India.*
           With Carol's parents, they held health-evangelism seminars in
        Madras. The crowd grew from 40 the first evening to more than 500
        on Sabbath. They rejoiced as several Hindu people accepted
        Jesus as their Saviour.
           Soon they were on the train to Rupam. For three years James
        had prayed for this city, and now they were here! On the railway
        platform the couple prayed that God would lead them to the people
        He wanted them to meet.
            They found a city of 250,000 Hindus and Muslims. They watched
        a family making carpets. Even the children helped, tying one single
        thread at a time onto the loom. James asked why the children were
        not in school, and learned that even the public schools cost
        money, and many families could not afford tuition. At one local
        school 700 children sat on dirt floors in several small classrooms,
        learning to read and write.
            The couple discovered a Christian church in an ideal location in
        the center of town. But a padlock on the door, broken windows,
        thick dust, and peeling plaster told them that no one had wor-
        shiped there recently. They went to the city chairman (mayor) to
        inquire about the vacant building
            "The chairman's wife was excited when we asked about the
        abandoned church. She spoke freely of her faith and her knowl-
        edge of God and the Bible," said Carol. "The chairman and his
        wife made the church available to us free, to renovate and use for
        literacy and health programs. Our prayers were being answered!"
            Of the 1.6 million people in the district surrounding Rupam,
        fewer than 100 are Christians, and the area is openly anti-Christian.
        For the chairman and his wife to be Christians is a miracle! "Later,
        when we were in Delhi," said James, "we learned that a colporteur
        had sold her books and literature and been giving her Bible stud-
        ies for five or six years! God had prepared the way for our work in
        Rupam long before we even knew we would go! How can we doubt
         that He will be with us as we begin our work there?"

            * The identity of James and Carol Bahr and the city in which
         they work have been changed to protect the work in the area of India
         where they serve.

       Jesus, Supplier of All
            Our Needs
                                    r4




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Phil. 4:1-23.
     MEMORY TEXT: "I can do everything through him who
     gives me strength" (Philippians 4:13, NIV).

  KEY THOUGHT: As we depend on Christ for strength to
do His will, allowing our minds to dwell only on that which is
pure and beautiful, we will have cause for constant rejoicing
and will experience unity and mutual benevolence with our
brothers and sisters in the church.

   JESUS EMPOWERS US THROUGH HIS SPIRIT. Jesus is
more than able to keep us from falling (Jude 24); we "can do all
things" through Christ who strengthens us (Phil. 4:13).
   This is not to say that committed Christians have not sinned
or had failures and moments of doubt. Doubt, anxiety, anger,
impatience, self-serving maneuvers, impurity, laziness—all such
happen when believers forget that their strength is in the Lord
and not in themselves. Understanding the role of the Holy
Spirit brings realism to the claim that "I can do all things."
   "It is the Spirit that makes effectual what has been wrought
out by the world's Redeemer. It is by the Spirit that the heart is
made pure. Through the Spirit the believer becomes a partaker
of the divine nature. Christ has given His Spirit as a divine
power to overcome all hereditary and cultivated tendencies to
evil, and to impress His own character upon His church."
—The Desire of Ages, p. 671.

STAND FIRM IN THE LORD (Phil. 4:1-3).

  By what means is it possible for us to "stand firm ... in the
Lord" (Phil. 4:1, RSV)? Isa. 41:10; Eph. 3:16, 17.


   Paul's concluding remarks to the Philippians begin with a
pastor's expression of love and concern. "Therefore, my breth-
ren, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm
thus in the Lord, my beloved" (Phil. 4:1, RSV). Paul's longing
for his brethren and sisters was an unselfish concern for their
eternal well-being. In the presence of the Lord, they are his
victory wreath. Paul wrote in the same vein to the Thessalonians:
"For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our
Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not you? For you are our glory
and joy" (1 Thess. 2:19, 20, RSV).
   Paul's great burden is that, by continually leaning on the
mighty arm of the Lord, his children in the faith will receive
power to be true to the gospel principles he has taught them.
Thus, for them, the promises of Philippians 3:20, 21 will be
fulfilled.

   How is it possible for Christian believers "to agree with
each other" (Phil. 4:2, NIV)? Eph. 4:3; John 17:21-23 (compare
1 Cor. 1:10; 1 Peter 3:8).


   We are not told what was dividing Euodia and Syntyche.
Paul seemed to be confident that, with help (verse 3), they
could agree (verse 2). He hoped that their dedication to the
Lord would lead them to rise above their differences.
   "The secret of unity is found in the equality of believers in
Christ. The reason for all division, discord, and difference is
found in separation from Christ. Christ is the center to which
all should be attracted; for the nearer we approach the center,
the closer we shall come together in feeling, in sympathy, in
love, growing into the character and image of Jesus."—Selected
Messages, book 1, p. 259.

   Under what circumstances are our names placed in the
 book of life? Heb. 12:23 (compare Luke 10:20; Phil. 4:3).
 Under what circumstances will names be removed from the
 book of life? Ex. 32:33; Rev. 3:5 (compare Dan. 7:10; 12:1).
 How can we avoid having our names removed from the
 book of life? Rev. 19:7, 8 (compare 1 John 2:29).

                                                               49

HAVE NO ANXIETY (Phil. 4:4-7).
   What two expressions seem to reflect best Paul's spirit and
disposition as he faced life's uncertainties? Phil. 4:4, 6.

   Joy in the Lord permeates the Philippian letter. But we must
remember that Paul wrote these words from prison. What a
ministry! What a Lord! Is it possible that joy is more than an
emotion that comes easily only to naturally happy people?
Can it be that joy flows naturally from genuinely committed
Christian life?
   For many people, gritting one's teeth seems the best re-
sponse to hard times. Besides, rejoicing always (at all times)
seems unreasonable. But Paul tells us that circumstances need
not depress our mental attitudes or drown our joy.
   "Circumstances have but little to do with the experiences of
the soul. It is the spirit cherished which gives coloring to all
our actions. A man at peace with God and his fellow men
cannot be made miserable. Envy will not be in his heart; evil
surmising will find no room there; hatred cannot exist. The
heart in harmony with God is lifted above the annoyances and
trials of this life. But a heart where the peace of Christ is not, is
unhappy, full of discontent; the person sees defects in every-
thing, and he would bring discord into the most heavenly
music."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 488.
   We can have peace in the most traumatic circumstances by
placing our anxieties at the feet of Jesus. The anxious heart is
soothed by trust in Jesus. (See Matt. 11:28; 1 Peter 5:7.)
     By what spirit should Christians be known? Phil. 4:5.

   "Forbearance" (RSV) is a better rendering than "modera-
tion" (KJV). Perhaps Paul is thinking about a current problem
in the young churches, that of contention and rivalry for
"honors" in doing Christian work. But what is more pleasing
than a humble, tolerant, approachable person, whether in the
home, in an everyday work situation, or church activity?

  Are you a person who does not mind yielding when no
principle is involved? Do you adopt a gentle spirit toward
others, even when principle is involved?

WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED, DO (Phil. 4:8, 9).

   In Paul's summation of the Christian life pattern that will
eliminate personal and church tensions, list the six
"whatsoevers" and the two "ifs." Phil. 4:8.


    "True." If a person is not "square" with the universe, if
something or someone is valued that conflicts with God's plumb
line, spiritual growth in Christ is jeopardized.
    "Honest." Better, "honorable" (RSV). Motives are vital, and
influence is beyond measurement. The believer always should
be an honorable representative of his Lord.
     "Just" or "righteous." Christians will not hesitate to ask in
all situations whether their decisions are in harmony with the
will and law of God.
    "Pure." Not only sexual purity but also pure motives, cleansed
from unholy ambition and greed, are included.
    "Lovely." Here is the only time that this Greek word is used
in the New Testament, but how fitting—to seek that which is
pleasing and lovable.
    "Of good report" or "praiseworthy," "of good reputation."
To the Thessalonians Paul said, 'Abstain from every form of
evil" (1 Thess. 5:22, RSV). A high obligation rests on Christians
to make a good impression for the truth.
     "Any virtue." The emphasis is moral excellence, and the six
characteristics of the joyful Christian become meaningful only
if they are honestly pursued.
    "Any praise." Look for the best in people and offer them
sincere positive reinforcement.
    "Think." "There must be a steadfast resistance of tempta-
 tion in thought or act. The soul must be kept from every stain,
 through faith in Him who is able to keep you from falling."
 —Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p.
1145.

   How does Paul connect theology and daily habits? Phil.
4:9.


   Christianity was never meant to be just one more world
religion with an interesting theology, yet leaving its followers
as self-indulgent, greedy, and spiteful as anyone else. For Chris-
tians, meditation and theological information have a purpose—
to translate the teaching of Christ into a life that reflects Him.
True Christians hear and then do.
                                                               51
Wednesday                                        August 3
ALL THINGS THROUGH CHRIST (Phil. 4:10-13).

   Faithful, grateful dependence upon Christ is the secret of
radiant Christian life and witness. When Robert Morrison, the
first Christian missionary to China, disembarked from his ship
in a Chinese port, the captain said with a sneer, "So you think
you are going to make an impression upon China." Morrison
quietly replied, "No, sir, but I believe God will."

  What was Paul's attitude toward good times and bad?
Phil. 4:11, 12.


   Paul's companionship with Jesus had given him a self-
sufficiency that transcended all earthly circumstances. Humble
in prosperity, strong in tough times, these circumstances did
not deprive him of peace and godly contentment. Jesus had
become Paul's great enabler (1 Tim. 1:12).

  What was Paul's open secret that explained his joy, cour-
age, and Christian confidence? Phil. 4:13.


   This text has always been a strong pillar for growing Chris-
tians. But for many it remains an untouched promise; they
have never discovered that God means exactly what He prompted
Paul to write. Above all else, God desires His children to turn
from sin and engage in joyful obedience to His will—all made
possible by the power of the Holy Spirit.
   Paul was writing these words, not from a Mediterranean
resort, but as a prisoner of the Roman Empire. By worldly
standards, he had everything to be discouraged about.
   "The heavenly intelligences will work with the human agent
who seeks with determined faith that perfection of character
which will reach out to perfection in action. To everyone en-
gaged in this work Christ says, I am at your right hand to help
you.
   "As the will of man cooperates with the will of God, it
becomes omnipotent. Whatever is to be done at His command,
may be accomplished in His strength. All His biddings are
enablings."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 332, 333.

   Because we can do all things through the power of Christ,
why are there some educational, professional, and finan-
cial goals that we cannot reach?

GOD WILL SUPPLY EVERY NEED (Phil. 4:14-23).

  What was the primary reason that Paul was grateful for
the generosity of the Philippians? Phil. 4:14-18.

   Paul was thankful for the financial support the Philippians
had consistently provided for the work of the gospel and for
his personal needs. But there was a deeper reason for his
gratitude. "The gift was really an investment entered as a credit
on the account of the Philippians, an investment which is in-
creasingly paying them rich dividends. These dividends or fruits
in the lives of his friends are the object of Paul's concern. . . .
Right giving always enriches the giver. 'The liberal soul will be
made fat' (Prov. 11:25). 'He who pities the poor lends to the
Lord' (Prov. 19:17). 'Blessed are the merciful, for they will
obtain mercy' (Matt. 5:7). 'God loves a cheerful giver' (2 Cor.
9:7)."—William Hendriksen, New Testament Commentary,
Philippians, Colossians and Philemon (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker,
1962), p. 208.
   How did Paul share with his Philippian friends the basic
truth that helped him to live above changing circumstances
and remain cheerful and faithful? Phil. 4:19.

   Paul had learned for himself that God is everything that the
Old Testament said He would be. (See Ps. 18:35; 31:19; Isa.
40:11; Mal. 3:10.) Jesus was for Paul a personal Saviour from
sin and fear and want.
   "If men love and obey God, and do their part, God will
provide for all their wants. Although your living may have to
be obtained by the sweat of your brow, you are not to distrust
God; for in the great plan of His providence, He will supply
your need from day to day."—Ellen G. White, Review and Her-
ald, September 18, 1888.
   Christians who long to bring cheer and hope to the erring or
unbelievers can have confidence that even the words they
should speak will be given at the proper time. (See Christ's
Object Lessons, p. 149.)

    In view of our Lord's promises, how much responsibil-
 ity rests upon Christians to work toward satisfying the
 needs of their families, their own personal needs, and the
 needs of their neighbors?

                                                                 53
Friday                                           August 5
FURTHER STUDY: On God's abundant supply of our spirit-
ual needs read: Ps. 36:7-9; John 10:10; 2 Cor. 9:8; Eph. 3:20.
   Read "Rejoicing in the Lord in Steps to Christ, pp. 115-126;
"Mind Cure" in The Ministry of Healing, pp. 246-257.

   "Even here Christians may have the joy of communion with
Christ; they may have the light of His love, the perpetual
comfort of His presence. Every step in life may bring us closer
to Jesus, may give us a deeper experience of His love, and may
bring us one step nearer to the blessed home of peace. Then let
us not cast away our confidence, but have firm assurance,
firmer than ever before."—Steps to Christ, p. 125.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. In your experience, what have been the physical and
     psychological effects of rejoicing and praising God?
     By contrast, what have been the effects of worry and
     depression?

     2. How can we cooperate with God in keeping our minds
        focused on pure and beautiful things?

     3. Can you testify to the blessings involved in giving
        generously for God's work? Have you relieved the needs
        of someone who was struggling financially? How did
        your generosity result in blessing to you?

SUMMARY: Paul reminds the Philippians and us of the joy
associated with claiming Christ's strength to stand firm in the
faith, maintaining spiritual unity, and focusing our minds and
hearts on praise to God. By thinking positive, pure thoughts,
ever trusting in His enabling power, we can retain Christ's
presence and peace. By generosity to others we can be re-
minded of God's infinite love and kindness toward us.

                                 Adrian Taylor

     She stood before me, her head buried in her hands, sobbing
  over and over, "Why?" Her question hit me like a bullet.
      I was her English teacher in Thailand. I stood listening to 17-
  year-old Pam, who expected me to know the answer to her
  questions. She poured out her heart.
      "My friend went to the riots last month, and she didn't come
  home. Why?" she sobbed.
      Living in a country during a state of emergency brings with
  it a feeling of impending destruction and insecurity. In a few
  bloody nights in 1992, during violent demonstrations and
  clashes with police, more than 1,000 people failed to go home.
  A few were undeniably dead; the rest were classed as "missing
  persons." Over the next few months, rumors spread of mili-
  tary trucks secretly taking piles of bodies and dumping them
  into mass graves.
      "Why her? She's my best friend. I almost went with her that
  night. Now she is gone, and I am here." The pain in Pam's voice
  punctuated her words. I felt helpless as I watched Pam, one of
  my best students, crying out for want of any hope. I knew that
  the society in which she lived and the religion that was a part of
  her life could never give Pam, or thousands of people like her, an
  answer to her question. Nothing I had learned in college or
  during my travels had prepared me for this. So I waited, hoping
  for some flash of inspiration that would help me.
      Suddenly, amid sobs, Pam asked, "Who is Jesus?"
      "Oh, Lord, opportunities like this only happen in mission
  stories." Prayerfully I began to explain who Jesus is. For more
  than three hours, we talked and prayed. As she was leaving,
  she paused at the door, and in a gentle, reverent tone said,
  "Your Jesus IS real, isn't He?" Then she disappeared out of the             a,
  door, swallowed up by the mass of humanity that swarmed
  along the Bangkok street.
                          I returned to college to continue my stud-
                       ies, but the experiences in Thailand had
                       forever changed my life. Nothing, abso-
                       lutely nothing, can remain the same after
                       someone comes to ask, "Why," and leaves
                       exclaiming, "Your Jesus is real!"

Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Col. 1:1-20.

     MEMORY TEXT: "For in him all the fulness of God was
     pleased to dwell" (Colossians 1:19, RSV).
   KEY THOUGHT: Jesus Christ, the "fulness of God," is our
Creator and Redeemer, who holds the universe together and,
because of His sacrifice, reconciles believing sinners to Himself
for eternity.
   WHY DID PAUL WRITE TO THE COLOSSIANS? "The
first and second chapters of Colossians have been presented to
me as an expression of what our churches in every part of the
world should be."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 7, p. 906.
   Paul wrote to the Colossian Christians for four main rea-
sons:
   1.To direct their attention to Christ as the very image of the
invisible God, the Creator, Redeemer, Reconciler, and Head of
the church. (Col. 1:13-18.)
   2. To warn them against falling back into their old sinful
way of life and to warn against the teachings of those who
were depreciating Christ as the only solution for the sin prob-
lem. (Col. 1:21, 23; 2:8; 3:5-7.)
   3. To emphasize the importance of forgiveness and kind-
ness. (Col. 3:12-14.)
   4.To enhance their respect for their former pastor, Epaphras,
and for the gospel he taught them. (Col. 1:7; 4:12, 13.)

Sunday                                              August 7
THE HOPE LAID UP FOR YOU (Col. 1:1-8).
  What inspired the Colossian Christians with love for one
another? Col. 1:1-6.

  Consider the ingredients of Paul's salutation and thanksgiv-
ing. He writes "to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ at
Colossae" (Col. 1:2, RSV). They are saints or holy ones because
Christ has set them apart for His holy purpose by counting His
merits for them and by giving them the gift of the Holy Spirit.
(Compare 1 Peter 1:2.) Their faith in Christ (Col. 1:4), their
hope of eternal life, and their loyalty to the "word of the truth"
(verse 5) inspired them with love for one another and earnest
involvement in the spread of the gospel, which "in the whole
world . . . is bearing fruit and growing" (verse 6, RSV).
  What had Epaphras done for the Colossian Christians?
Col. 1:7, 8; 4:12, 13.

   Whether or not Paul had ever visited the Colossians, they
had learned the gospel from Epaphras. Now that Epaphras
was in Rome with Paul, his deep concern for his church mem-
bers in Colossae, Laodicea, and Hierapolis was unflagging. He
pleaded with God that they would "stand perfect and com-
plete in all the will of God" (Col. 4:12).
   "It was this gospel of the true grace of God that the Colossians
had learned . . . from the lips of Epaphras. The implication
seems to be that this fellow servant of Paul's had been a consci-
entious and thorough teacher of the gospel message. His mis-
sion had been no hit-and-run affair with minimal instruction.
The truth had been fully explained and applied, and Paul,
characteristically, gives due praise to his friend and envoy.
Incidentally, this is further evidence that Paul had a great
capacity for drawing others to share his concerns, and making
them feel partners in the work, and the apostle was exemplary
in supporting his junior partners when occasion demanded."
—R. C. Lucas, The Message of Colossians and Philemon (Downers
Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press, 1980), p. 33.

A LIFE FULLY PLEASING TO GOD (Col. 1:9-12).

   With what kind of wisdom and knowledge does God wish
to fill us? Col. 1:9.


   The kind of wisdom and knowledge Paul is speaking about
is not worldly or academic; it is the wisdom and knowledge
imparted by the Holy Spirit. "We impart a secret and hidden
wisdom of God, which God decreed before the ages for our
glorification." This is wisdom that "no eye has seen, nor ear
heard," but which "God has revealed to us through the Spirit"
(1 Cor. 2:7, 9, 10, RSV). "We have not received the spirit of the
world but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand
what God has freely given us. This is what we speak, not in
words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the
Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words" (verses
12, 13, NIV).

   What is God's purpose in filling us "with the knowledge
of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding" (Col.
1:9, RSV)? Col. 1:10-12.


   The New International Version translates verse 10: "And we
pray this in order that you may live a life worthy of the Lord
and may please him in every way: bearing fruit in every good
work, growing in the knowledge of God."
   The Holy Spirit's primary concern is to strengthen the be-
liever and the Christian community so that all that had been
perverted by sin is restored.
   "The affections, perverted by sin, become degenerated and
depraved; but through a connection with Christ they are brought
into a higher, holier channel; and, aided by the divine grace,
man may be an overcomer. The faculties, warped in a wrong
direction through the influence of sin, need no longer be . . .
wasted on accomplishing selfish purposes. . . . When the soul
has been convicted of sin, has accepted of Christ, the character
becomes transformed, and there is an elevation and purifica-
tion of all the powers of the being. They are no longer debased
by selfish aims and unholy actions. What may not man become
through the grace given him by God! . . . He may show forth an
example of righteousness, of true holiness."—Ellen G. White,
Signs of the Times, October 6, 1890.

CHRIST THE PREEMINENT ONE (Col. 1:13-16).

   According to Colossians 1:13, 14, what is involved in "the
forgiveness of sins"?


   Paul also relates forgiveness to redemption in his Epistle to
the Ephesians: "In him we have redemption through his blood,
the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his
grace" (Eph. 1:7, RSV). Forgiveness is deliverance from Satan's
kingdom and transference into Christ's.
   "To be pardoned in the way that Christ pardons, is not only
to be forgiven, but to be renewed in the spirit of our mind. The
Lord says, 'A new heart will I give unto thee.' The image of
Christ is to be stamped upon the very mind, heart, and soul.
The apostle says, 'And we have the mind of Christ.' Without
the transforming process which can come alone through di-
vine power, the original propensities to sin are left in the heart
in all their strength, to forge new chains, to impose a slavery
that can never be broken by human power. But men can never
enter heaven with their old tastes, inclinations, idols, ideas,
and theories."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, August 19,
1890.

   How did Paul express the preeminence (superiority, or
primacy) of Jesus? Col. 1:15, 16.


   How could Christ be "the image of the invisible God" and
the Creator of "all things" if He were the first creature to have
been created? The Scriptures identify Christ as God, who has
an eternity of preexistence. (See John 1:1-3; 5:18; 8:58; 14:9;
Micah 5:2.)
   The Greek word translated "firstborn" is applied to Christ
seven times in the New Testament: Luke 2:7; Matt. 1:25; Rom.
8:28, 29; Col. 1:15, 18; Heb. 1:6; Rev. 1:5. In the Greek Old
Testament the word is sometimes used in a figurative sense
meaning the strongest of its kind. (See Job 18:12, 13; Isa. 14:30.)
Sometimes the word means status of dignity, or preeminence,
given to a person who is not the first son to be born into a
family. David is called God's firstborn (Ps. 89:27). Jacob was
the firstborn in God's sight (Ex. 4:22), and so was Ephraim (Jer.
31:9).
   Christ is the firstborn in the sense of the preeminent One
over all creation and over all the creatures of His hand.


                                                                59

CHRIST THE HEAD OVER ALL (Col. 1:17,18).

   What responsibilities did the Creator accept after He cre-
ated the universe? Col. 1:17.


   "Consist. . . . literally, 'to stand together,' to hold together,'
or 'to cohere.' The form of the verb in Greek stresses an origi-
nal organization and a continued maintenance of the organiza-
tion. The power that holds the far-flung orbs of the universe on
their appointed courses with mathematical accuracy, the power
that holds the particles of the atom in their predetermined
orbits, is the same. By the power of Christ all things cohere."
—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 192.

  Study the following passages, which discuss Christ as the
Head of the church: Col. 1:18; 2:19; Eph. 1:22; 4:15.


    In Colossians 1:15-17 Paul established our Lord's preemi-
nence in Creation; he now establishes His preeminence in re-
demption. Paul's earlier comments regarding Jesus and the
church as "body" (Rom. 12:5; 1 Cor. 12:12-31) emphasized that
the church was more of an organism than an organization.
Each member has something important to contribute to the
well-being of the body; as the eye or foot relates to the physical
body, so the deacon or accountant or teacher should relate to
the church body.
    But in Colossians 1:18 Paul goes even farther. Here Jesus is
the Head of the church, serving a function similar to a person's
head attached to a physical body. What does a head do? It
regulates and organizes growth, gives guidance, provides per-
sonality to an otherwise purely nonpersonal, nonemotive,
physical-chemical operation.
   The strength of the church is not in the wisdom or energy of
its members, devoted as they may be. The head makes possible
whatever the body needs for life and growth.
   "God has made His church on the earth a channel of light,
and through it He communicates His purposes and His will.
He does not give to one of His servants an experience indepen-
dent of and contrary to the experience of the church itself.
Neither does He give one man a knowledge of His will for the
entire church while the church—Christ's body—is left in dark-
ness. . . . Those who are inclined to regard their individual
judgment as supreme are in grave peril."—The Acts of the Apostles,
pp. 163, 164.

CHRIST THE RECONCILER (Cot. 1:19, 20).

  What distinguished Jesus from all other men and women
ever to live on this planet and from all other created beings
anywhere in the universe? Col. 1:19; 2:9.


   Fulness means "the sum total," "the superabundance." In
the New Testament it generally means completeness. (See Mark
8:20; Rom. 13:10; Gal. 4:4; Eph. 1:10, 23.). Christ is the sum total
of the Deity. Mysteriously the three Personalities of the De-
ity—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—are one God. Each of the
three Persons is the "fulness" of the Godhead. (See Evangelism,
pp. 614, 615.)
   Neither was this "fulness" a temporary arrangement. Jesus
was not merely "a very good man who was fully committed to
God." He was not merely "fully" and completely conformed to
God's purpose. Jesus was fully God, completely, eternally.
Whatever Jesus did or said reflected what God does or says.
(See John 14:9.)

  What was the great, incomparable result of Christ's life
and death? Cot. 1:20.

   In reconciling "all things" unto Himself, God's delight or
pleasure is on full display. Salvation is God's idea, not man's.
The eternal gift, the permanent condescension of God the Son,
was considered worth the price—and it was an unspeakable
price. No created being will ever be able to compute it or to
understand it. (See John 3:16.)
   Where once there was hostility, reconciliation brings a new
relationship. God did not have to be reconciled. Jesus did not
die to change God's mind or feelings regarding man. Fallen
humankind was the alienated party, not God. (See Col. 1:21,
22; 2 Cor. 5:19.)
   "Satan has represented God as selfish and oppressive, as
claiming all, and giving nothing, as requiring the service of His
creatures for His own glory, and making no sacrifice for their
good. But the gift of Christ reveals the Father's heart. . . . It
declares that while God's hatred of sin is as strong as death,
His love for the sinner is stronger than death."—The Desire of
Ages, p. 57.

   What responsibility do I have in accepting this costly,
 but freely given, hand of reconciliation?

                                                                  61
Friday                                            August 12
FURTHER STUDY: Study the following texts that speak of
Christ's work of reconciliation: 2 Cor. 5:18; Eph. 2:16; Heb.
2:17. Read parts of the chapters "God With Us," "Gethsemane,"
"Calvary," and "It is Finished" in The Desire of Ages, pp. 20-24;
690-693; 755-757; 761-764.
   "Christ came to the world to counteract Satan's falsehood
that God had made a law which men could not keep. Taking
humanity upon Himself, He came to this earth, and by a life of
obedience showed that God has not made a law that man
cannot keep. He showed that it is possible for man perfectly to
obey the law. Those who accept Christ as their Saviour, becom-
ing partakers of His divine nature, are enabled to follow His
example, living in obedience to every precept of the law. Through
the merits of Christ, man is to show by his obedience that he
could be trusted in heaven, that he would not rebel."—The
Faith I Live By, p. 114.
   "His death had answered the question whether the Father
and the Son had sufficient love for man to exercise self-denial
and a spirit of sacrifice."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 70.
 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What relationship do you see between Paul's counsel
     that our lives should be "fully pleasing" to God (Col.
    1:10, RSV) and his teaching that Christ is "the fulness"
     of God (Col. 1:19, RSV)? (See Eph. 1:23; 3:19.)
     2. From your experiences in life, what examples can you
        give of reconciliation between two people after they
        have found Christ as their personal Saviour?
     3. Christ is the head of the church. How then do you
        explain the imperfections you see in the church? In the
        light of the fact that Christ is in charge, how should we
        go about helping to correct these imperfections?
SUMMARY: Paul praises the Colossians for their faithfulness
to the gospel they have been taught. He pleads with them to
allow God to fill them with His love and power so that their
lives will fully reflect His character. This is possible because
Christ, the fullness of Deity, who has forgiven our sins and
reconciled us to God, will progressively strengthen us for pa-
tient endurance of life's challenges.

                  Breakthrough in Rahimyar Khan
                               Emmanuel Bashir

            The city of Rahimyar Khan, Pakistan, has a population of
         more than two million, 200,000 of which are Christians, but
         none are Adventist. Two years ago Pakistan Union Section
         President S. A. Ditta and Southern Section President Emmanuel
         Bashir proposed to evangelize Rahimyar Khan, situated on the
         border between the provinces of Sind and Punjab.
            A team went to Rahimyar Khan to survey residents and to
         plan an evangelistic series. The team visited many in the
         Christian community, including pastors of other denomina-
         tions. Some Christians welcomed Adventists, but some were
         unhappy we were planning to hold meetings in their area.
            In December 1992, the effort began. Three hundred to
         four hundred came every night; many from distant parts
         of the city. During the day pastors visited interests and
         gave Bible studies to those who requested them.
            Opposition to the meetings grew, and people were told
         that Adventists do not believe the whole Bible, follow women,
         and are not Christians. As a result, some stopped attending
         the meetings. Others attempted to disrupt our efforts. We
         went to our hotel room and prayed. "Lord, it is Your work.
         We cannot do it with our own power and wisdom."
            We felt impressed to visit the pastor who had opposed us
         most strongly. We met with all the Christian pastors to
         answer questions in their minds. As a result the pastor who
         opposed us the most began attending the meetings and
         offered to bring his church choir to sing for us. He and his
         family even offered to sing special songs in the meetings.
            No more organized opposition plagued the remaining
         meetings, and at the close of the series many indicated
         their desire to continue attending.
            We hope to send a pastor to Rahimyar Khan to continue
         to follow up interests and lead them to a full surrender to
         Jesus Christ. As funds become available we want to build
                                a church building, church school, health
                                clinic, and pastor's home in Rahimyar
                                Khan. We trust God to work out the
                                details in His time. He will see that the
                                work He blessed in its beginning will
                                bear fruit at harvesttime.
                                Emmanuel Bashir is president of the
                              Pakistan Southern Section.

Jesus, Our o • e of Glory



Sabbath fte o
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Col. 1:21-2:7.
     MEMORY TEXT: "To them God has chosen to make known
     among the Gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery,
     which is Christ in you, the hope of glory" (Colossians 1:27,
     NIV).
   KEY THOUGHT: The revealed mystery, "Christ in you, the
hope of glory" (Col. 1:27), is the means by which God recon-
ciles to Himself those who accept Christ.
   CHRIST'S LIFE IS TO BE REPRODUCED IN US. Writing
of Jerry McAuley's Bowery mission, S. H. Hadley told the
story of a tramp who responded to the invitation for everyone
who wanted to become a Christian to come forward and kneel
at the altar. The preacher knelt beside the tramp and listened
as he prayed the same sentence over and over again, "Dear
Lord, make me like Joe."
   The preacher interrupted the tramp to say, "Ask God to
make you like Jesus."
   The tramp opened his eyes and looked at the preacher in
astonishment. He asked, "Was Jesus any better than Joe?"
Everybody in the community loved Joe. He had been con-
verted two years before and had led many people to Christ. Joe
had been buried that afternoon—and the street people of the
Bowery wept.
   Christ wants to make us like Himself. The mystery that
solves the sin problem is "Christ in you." The Holy Spirit
living in our hearts is Christ within. Because of His presence,
we reflect His love, compassion, and purity. (See Rom. 8:4-10;
Eph. 3:16, 17.)

THE AIM OF REDEMPTION (Col. 1:21-23).

  What was the purpose of Christ's death? Col. 1:21, 22.


    In living and dying, Jesus made clear throughout the uni-
verse, especially to our lost planet, that God is the sinner's
friend. Jesus also came to give alienated sinners hope of recon-
ciliation with God. What is the result?
     "To present." Paul emphasized God's grand design. "He
chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we
should be holy and blameless before him. He destined us . . . to
be his sons . . . to the praise of his glorious grace" (Eph. 1:4-6,
RSV).
    "Holy." "To be holy is to reflect the divine image, for God is
holy (1 Peter 1:16). The purpose of the plan of salvation is to
restore the divine image in man."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol.
6, p. 998.
    "Unblameable." The same word is rendered "without fault"
in Revelation 14:5. The grace of God is greater far than the
hosts of evil and the deepest sinful habits. (Note how the same
Greek word is used in Eph. 5:27; Jude 24.)
    "Unreproveable." The Greek word means "blameless," or
"irreproachable." (Note its use in 1 Cor. 1:8.)
    "When we surrender ourselves wholly to God, and fully
believe, the blood of Christ cleanses from all sin. The con-
science can be freed from condemnation. Through faith in His
blood, all may be made perfect in Christ Jesus. Thank God we
are not dealing with impossibilities. We may claim sanctifica-
tion."—Selected Messages, book 2, p. 32.

  On what condition could Jesus present His followers "holy
and unblameable and unreproveable"? Col. 1:22, 23.


   Christ's sacrificial death (verse 20) provided the basis for
humankind's salvation, but faith is the condition of salvation.
Paul's if is a basic biblical concept. Christian assurance is not
static, as it is in mistaken theories of predestination. On the
contrary, the believer's assurance is grounded on the promises
of God and in the life rooted, engrafted through faith, in Christ.
   "If we walk in the light . . . we have fellowship with one
another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanseth us from all
sin" (1 John 1:7). One act of faith is not enough. The believer
who is acceptable to God continues to believe; he makes a habit
of trusting and obeying. (See John 1:12; Rom. 10:9, 10.)
                                                                 65
Monday                                            August 15
THE OPEN SECRET (Col. 1:24-27).

     Why did Paul rejoice in his sufferings? Col. 1:24, 25.


   "The concept is not that the suffering of Paul is needed to
supplement the sufferings of Christ in order to secure recon-
ciliation, as though the sufferings of Christ were insufficient.
[See 1 John 2:2.] It is rather that, since Christ suffered for us,
the members of His body, we, the fellow members of the body
should suffer for each other in order that each can live the
victorious life in Christ to the full. Paul wanted to finish endur-
ing the sufferings which were assigned to him, out of gratitude
to Christ."—Yeager, The Renaissance New Testament, vol. 15, p.
34.

  What is the revealed mystery that lies at the heart of the
gospel? Col. 1:26, 27.


   Paul refers to truths that men and women would not know
unless God revealed them. What Paul refers to as a "mystery"
was partially understood in Old Testament times—that all
nations would be blessed by Christ. (See Gen. 22:18; 26:4; Isa.
60:1-3). But the "mystery" became actual fact after Pentecost.
Jesus had "broken down the dividing wall of hostility" (Eph.
2:14, RSV).
   The witness of Christ within, as validated by the Holy Spirit's
witness, is the consistent theme of the New Testament. (See
1 John 3:24, RSV.)
   But what does "Christ in you" through the Holy Spirit mean?
As Christ's representative, the "impartation of the Spirit is the
impartation of the life of Christ. It imbues the receiver with the
attributes of Christ. Only those who are thus taught of God,
those who possess the inward working of the Spirit, and in
whose life the Christ-life is manifested, are to stand as repre-
sentative men, to minister in behalf of the church."—The Desire
of Ages, p. 805. (See also Eph. 3:16, 17; Rom. 8:9-11.)

   How important is the work of the Holy Spirit in relation to
the living and dying of Jesus?
   "The Spirit was to be given as a regenerating agent, and
without this the sacrifice of Christ would have been of no
avail. . . . It is the Spirit that makes effectual what has been
wrought out by the world's Redeemer. It is by the Spirit that
the heart is made pure."—The Desire of Ages, p. 671.

THE GOAL OF GOSPEL PREACHING (Col. 1:28-2:5).
   At the age of 16 George Mueller, of Bristol, England, was
imprisoned for theft. Later as a university student he lived a
wild, profligate life. When, at the age of 20, he experienced the
new birth, his life was transformed. He became a great man of
faith, relying on God to supply the needs of his orphanages. At
his death, his personal possessions were valued at less than
$1,000. Like Paul, he had striven with all the energy with
which Christ had inspired him, so he might present others to
Him.
   How does Paul describe the goal of gospel preaching? Col.
1:28, 29; 2:1.

   Christ of the cross was also Christ of the indwelling Spirit—
and Paul held these two open mysteries before his hearers
without diminishing one for the other. The subject of Paul's
preaching was Jesus Christ; the result was transformed men
and women who joined His kingdom of love and loyalty.
   Paul sees the purpose of his preaching to be identical with
that of the grand design for the plan of salvation (see verse 22):
to "present every man perfect in Christ Jesus" (Col. 1:28). "Per-
fect" in this context refers to Christian maturity, to those who
are fulfilling the purpose that God intends for His followers. In
this life and in eternity, absolute perfection of spiritual, men-
tal, physical, and social faculties will never be attained, be-
cause growth is always possible. But perfection, in the sense of
victory over sin, is available to all through Christ. "Moral
perfection is required of all."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 330.
   The true preacher's goal is to lead people to accept "Christ
in you" (verse 27) so that progressively, selfishness, greed,
unholy ambition, hate, and whatever else that is contrary to
the spirit of Jesus is removed from their lives. Insofar as Christ
dwells in their hearts, they enjoy present salvation in Christ
(Col. 2:10).
  What experience may become ours as we daily respond to
Christ? Col. 2:2-5.

  In this passage look for: (1) unity; (2) assurance; (3) spiritual
understanding; (4) ability to detect error; (5) orderliness; (6)
unwavering faith in Christ.

                                                                67
Wednesday                                          August 17
RECEIVING AND WALKING (Col. 2:6).

  In what way did Paul keep simple the great teachings of
justification and sanctification? Col. 2:6.


   Christians receive Christ through faith, and they walk with
Jesus by faith. (See 2 Cor. 5:7; Gal. 5:16.) The faith that realizes
man's helplessness and trusts God completely for pardon is
the same faith that realizes man's powerlessness and trusts
God completely for the ability to do His will. The faith of
justification is no different from the faith of sanctification.
   "The faith that is unto salvation is not a mere intellectual
assent to the truth. He who waits for entire knowledge before
he will exercise faith cannot receive blessing from God. It is not
enough to believe about Christ; we must believe in Him. The
only faith that will benefit us is that which embraces Him as a
personal Saviour; which appropriates His merits to ourselves.
Many hold faith as an opinion. Saving faith is a transaction by
which those who receive Christ join themselves in covenant
relation with God. Genuine faith is life. A living faith means an
increase of vigor, a confiding trust, by which the soul becomes
a conquering power."—The Desire of Ages, p. 347.

  What conditions and responsibilities are explicit in
Colossians 2:6?


   Although God gives us the ability to believe and trust, He
does not do our believing for us—no more than He does our
breathing for us, though He gives us the gift of breathing.
Neither does God transform our characters if we do not will to
choose His way for us. God leads us to repent, but He will not
repent for us. Without growing weary, God bids us to walk in
the light that is ever advancing (Prov. 4:18), but He will not
force us to walk, nor will He record that we have complied if
we have not.

   "By faith you became Christ's, and by faith you are to
grow up in Him—by giving and taking. You are to give
all—your heart, your will, your service—give yourself to
Him to obey all His requirements; and you must take all—
Christ, the fullness of all blessing, to abide in your heart, to
be your strength, your righteousness, your everlasting
helper—to give you power to obey."—Steps to Christ, p. 70.

ESTABLISHED IN THE FAITH (Col. 2:7).

  What clear counsel did Paul give regarding the "how" of
Christian growth? Col. 2:7.


   The Colossians were already well established in the faith.
They did not need new roots. But the process of building and
establishing the Christian's relationship with God is a continu-
ous program, a progressive work, an unending call. We never
love so well that there can be no improvement in expressing
love; our appreciation for others can always be improved as
we become wiser in discernment.

  How important to an individual's salvation is his growth,
the building of his life in accordance with the master plan?
Compare Col. 2:7 with Matt. 7:24; 1 Peter 2:2; 2 Peter 1:5-7;
Heb. 6:1.


   "Let no man present the idea that man has little or nothing
to do in the great work of overcoming; for God does nothing
for man without his cooperation. Neither say that after you
have done all you can on your part, Jesus will help you. Christ
has said, 'Without me ye can do nothing' (John 15:5). From
first to last man is to be a laborer together with God. Unless the
Holy Spirit works upon the human heart, at every step we
shall stumble and fall. Man's efforts alone are nothing but
worthlessness; but cooperation with Christ means a vic-
tory. . . . But though Christ is everything, we are to inspire
every man to unwearied diligence. We are to strive, wrestle,
agonize, watch, pray, lest we shall be overcome by the wily
foe. For the power and grace with which we can do this comes
from God, and all the while we are to trust in Him, who is able
to save to the uttermost all who come unto God by Him."
—Selected Messages, book 1, p. 381.
  "Abounding in thanksgiving" (Col. 2:7, RSV). Gratitude
reveals the Christian's sincerity, adds joy to the process of
being "built up in him," and makes the Christian's walk win-
some to the observer.

FURTHER STUDY: On the importance of continuing to walk
by faith, study Hebrews 10:38, 39; 1 Peter 1:9. Read "Let Not
Your Heart Be Troubled" in The Desire of Ages, pp. 671-680;
"The Scriptures a Safeguard" and "The Time of Trouble" in
The Great Controversy, pp. 598-601; 622, 623; Testimonies, vol. 2,
p. 609; and "Rejoicing in the Lord" in Steps to Christ, pp. 115-
126.
   "Even here Christians may have the joy of communion with
Christ; they may have the light of His love, the perpetual
comfort of His presence. Every step in life may bring us closer
to Jesus, may give us a deeper experience of His love, and may
bring us one step nearer to the blessed home of peace."—Steps
to Christ, p. 125.
 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How does this week's Scripture passage correct the
     misconception that, because Christ does everything for
     us, there is nothing for us to do except believe? How
     does the passage correct the misconception that we can
     make ourselves holy?
     2. What is the difference between Paul's concept of "Christ
        in you, the hope of glory" and pantheism, the idea that
        God exists in everything?
     3. How could this week's Scripture passage help you to
        explain Christ's standard for us in relation to the power
        He provides to reach the standard?
     4. How would you make clear to your next-door neigh-
        bor that we live for Christ in the same way that we
        receive Him initially?
SUMMARY: Because of Christ's death, we can be reconciled
to God if we accept Christ by faith. We can grow spiritually
toward moral perfection in Christ, if we live by faith. The
exalted scriptural standard of spiritual blamelessness, victory
over sinful behavior (Col. 1:22), is achievable only as we rely
upon the power provided by "Christ in you, the hope of glory"
(Col. 1:27).

             Be a Missionary? No Way!
                          Ray Allen
    "You want me to be a student missionary? Work with
Adventist World Radio? No way!" I argued. "I'm no broad-
caster. Never planned to be one. Never will. I'm not that
kind of material."
    A member of the student-missionary committee had
asked me to consider the challenge of being a student
missionary to work with Adventist World Radio in Portugal.
My answer was No. I was a theology major at Newbold at
the time and felt that working with broadcasting was not in
my plan. But he was kindly persistent, and finally I decided
to give it a try. That decision changed my life.
    After spending a year in Portugal with Adventist World
Radio, I returned to college to get a degree—in religious
communication. I've worked in a number of countries and
taught broadcasting at Newbold College for six years, along
with pastoral duties. Now I am again working with Adventist
World Radio as assistant program director. This time I knew
better than to tell God No.
    Rapid expansion of the Adventist World Radio network
necessitated a central resource office to assist AWR produc-
ers to broadcast the good news more efficiently and mean-
ingfully around the world. This office, on the campus of
Newbold College, collects, commissions, and disseminates
program ideas and materials to nearly 40 production centers
around the world.
    It has been 12 years since I almost said No to a life-
changing challenge as a student missionary. Through that
service God opened to me a hidden talent and showed me
ways to use it to benefit others. Now I can encourage and
assist students to make the most of the opportunities God has
 in store for them through the missionary outreach of Adventist
 World Radio.
     Adventist World Radio broadcasts 157 hours of radio
 programs in 43 languages each day from six locations in Guam,
                    Gabon, Costa Rica, Sicily, and Russia.

                  Adventist World Radio in England.

      Jesus, Our Standard of
          Truth and Life




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S LESSON: Col. 2:8-15.

     MEMORY TEXT: "And ye are complete in him, which is
     the head of all principality and power" (Colossians 2:10).

  KEY THOUGHT: Because Jesus Christ is the "fulness of
deity" (Col. 2:9, RSV), who paid the penalty for our sins, we
can be forgiven (verses 13, 14), and "come to fulness of life in
him" (verse 10).

   WE ARE COMPLETE IN CHRIST. Few passages in the
Bible focus the reader's mind on Jesus more intensely than
Colossians 2:8-15, our study for this week. It is difficult to find
words more beautiful to hear than "ye are complete in him"
(Col. 2:10, KJV), or "you have come to fulness of life in him"
(RSV). Say these words out loud. Say them again. If we have
unreservedly committed our lives to Christ and maintain that
commitment, then these words are true theologically and ex-
perientially.
   Everywhere men and women are disillusioned with many
concepts, beliefs, and cultural habits that were once taken for
granted. They are disenchanted with government, financial
planners, and technology. Even age-old social expectations
and moral codes that have held families and communities
together have been cast away by many.
   But Jesus, the center, still holds, no matter what else disinte-
grates. And that is what Jesus has been saying for a long time:
"I am the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6).

AUTHORITY FOR TRUTH (Col. 2:8).

   What contrast does Paul draw between true and false phi-
losophy? Col. 2:8.


   The philosophy that Paul opposes is human tradition based
on elemental teachings about the world and the universe. The
issue is between philosophy that is based on revealed truth
and philosophy generated by human speculation. (See Testi-
monies, vol. 8, p. 211.)
   On the basis of Paul's statements in the epistle, the false
philosophy troubling the Colossians is identified: (1) the idea
that Christ is an inferior deity (Col. 2:9); (2) the worship of
angels as intermediaries between God and man (Col. 2:18); (3)
Jewish and pagan legalism (Col. 2:16-23); (4) asceticism—based
on the idea that matter (flesh) is evil (Col. 2:20-23). All this
suggests an early form of gnosticism that taught that salvation
is available to those who enjoy this kind of philosophical knowl-
edge.

   What kind of false religious knowledge will be especially
influential in the last days? 1 Tim. 4:1 (compare 2 Thess. 2:9,
10; Rev. 16:13, 14).


   "I was directed to this scripture as especially applying to
modern spiritualism: Colossians 2:8. . . . The teachers of spirit-
ualism come in a pleasing, bewitching manner to deceive you,
and if you listen to their fables you are beguiled by the enemy
of righteousness and will surely lose your reward. When once
the fascinating influence of the archdeceiver overcomes you,
you are poisoned, and its deadly influence adulterates and
destroys your faith in Christ's being the Son of God, and you
cease to rely on the merits of His blood. Those deceived by this
philosophy are beguiled of their reward through the decep-
tions of Satan. They rely upon their own merits, exercise vol-
untary humility, are even willing to make sacrifices, and de-
base themselves, and yield their minds to the belief of supreme
nonsense, receiving the most absurd ideas through those whom
they believe to be their dead friends. Satan has so blinded their
eyes and perverted their judgment that they perceive not the
evil; and they follow out the instructions purporting to be from
their dead friends now angels in a higher sphere."—Testimo-
nies, vol. 1, pp. 297, 298. (Note how this applies to the teachings
of the "New Age.")
                                                                73
Monday                                            August 22
FULNESS OF TRUTH (Col. 2:9).
     What is our basis for calling Jesus "Lord"? Col. 2:9.

   "Fulness. . . . The encompassing stretch of this term is with-
out limit in time and space and power. Everything that God is,
every quality of Deity—dignity, authority, excellency, power
in creating and fitting the world, energy in upholding and
guiding the universe, love in redeeming mankind, forethought
in supplying everything needful for each of His creatures—
rests in Christ."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 202.
   We are faced here with a mind-stretching thought. A baby
born in Bethlehem, a young carpenter from Nazareth, an itin-
erant teacher crucified at 33 years of age, was also the One who
spun the worlds into their orbits and spelled out the moral
framework of the universe. All this is very difficult for anyone
to believe, if one chooses to accept only that which can be
proved from human experience. But for those who listen to
Him and submit to His invitations, Jesus is more than a great
teacher, more than the flowering of the human race. He is God,
who chose to become man so that humanity could get a true
picture of God and be redeemed to join His family.
   Note what the following passages teach regarding the char-
acter of the God-man, Jesus Christ:
Isa. 53:9
John 8:46
Heb. 4:15
1 Peter 2:22

   One of the primary purposes of Christ's incarnation was to
reveal what true humanity should and could be like, as well as
what God is really like. "To reveal this ideal as the only true
standard for attainment; to show what every human being
might become; what, through the indwelling of humanity by
divinity, all who received Him would become—for this, Christ
came to the world. He came to show how men are to be trained
as befits the sons of God; how on earth they are to practice the
principles and to live the life of heaven."—Education, pp. 73,
74.

FULNESS OF LIFE (Col. 2:10).
  How only may we find the answer to all of life's questions
and to all of its demands? Col. 2:10.

   The Greek may be translated: "And you have been made
complete [full, perfect] in Him." The verb used here means "to
make full, fill, fulfill, make complete, bring to an end." It is
translated "perfect" in both the KJV and the RSV of Revelation
3:2.
   Because Christ is the "fulness of the Deity," if filled with His
presence we are spiritually complete, full, perfect in Him. Prom-
ising the Holy Spirit, Jesus said, "I will come to you" (John
14:18). His presence and power qualified the dying thief, and
qualifies us, for heaven.
   The purposes in God's program to secure the universe for-
ever are (1) to atone for human sin, (2) to reveal Himself as One
who can be trusted, and (3) to empower believers to overcome
sin. Sin destroys, divides, deceives. Sin divides the mind and
thus mingles motives, joining good and bad habits.
   Christ, the Truth, puts all the pieces together. He enables the
believer to be consistent, to see the whole picture, even though
at times the picture may be hazy, dim, even blurred. Only by
listening to Him can men and women experience the fullness
of life.
  What does constantly receiving Christ's spiritual fullness
do for our characters? Col. 1:9, 10, 28 (compare Phil. 3:12-14).

   "The mighty power of the Holy Spirit works an entire trans-
formation in the character of the human agent, making him a
new creature in Christ Jesus. When a man is filled with the
Spirit, the more severely he is tested and tried, the more clearly
he proves that he is a representative of Christ. . . . Are we
striving with all our power to attain to the stature of men and
women in Christ? Are we seeking for His fullness, ever press-
ing toward the mark set before us—the perfection of His char-
acter? When the Lord's people reach this mark, they will be
sealed in their foreheads. Filled with the Spirit, they will be
complete in Christ, and the recording angel will declare, 'It is
finished."'—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commen-
tary, vol. 6, pp. 1117, 1118.


                                                                 75

TRUE CIRCUMCISION (Col. 2:11, 12).
  In what way does Paul make clear that human perfor-
mance is pure legalism unless the heart is changed? Col. 2:11.

   "Made without hands. Although the rite of circumcision
was performed by hand, its significance and value lay in the
fact of its inner meaning. It was designed to be an outward
sign of an inward state of faith and grace. [See Deut. 10:16;
30:6.] Through it Abraham indicated his belief that it was not
he, but God, who had life and could give life to others. This
peculiar sign was to distinguish all men of ancient Israel. It
pointed to Israel's complete devotion to Jehovah and obedi-
ence to all His requirements. . . . The circumcision that the
Colossian Christians had received was not external in the flesh.
It was an inward change in heart and life typified by their
baptism."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, pp. 202, 203.
  Why does Paul lift up baptism as especially important to
the Christian while disapproving of any spiritual signifi-
cance to circumcision? Col. 2:12.

   Along with other ceremonial observances that pointed for-
ward to the work of Christ, circumcision as a religious rite
ceased at the cross. (See Rom. 2:28, 29; Acts 15:1, 28, 29; Gal.
2:3; 5:6.) Baptism has taken the place of circumcision and in
many respects is a far superior witness to faith and commit-
ment. The child knows nothing of the experience or purpose of
circumcision; the believer understands that his baptism is the
outward sign of an inward experience.
   Paul's discussion is concerned with the spiritual and moral
aspects of circumcision only, not with its physical value. If
there is any spiritual value in any human act, it must be a work
of faith (Rom. 14:23). The symbolism of being buried under
water graphically symbolizes the believer's abrupt and com-
plete change of life and master. Even as Christ's resurrection
could be accomplished only by divine power, so the Christian
can be transformed into "the image of his Son" (Rom. 8:29)
only by the same divine power. (See Rom. 6:3-5.)

   What part is ours in preventing our religious observances
from becoming legalistic?

FORGIVENESS AND REGENERATION (Col. 2:13-15).

   Paul describes the former spiritual condition of the Colossian
believers. When they were outside of Christ, they were insen-
sitive to spiritual things, wedded to their sinful practices. (Com-
pare Rom. 8:5-8; Eph. 2:1-5.) When they became believers, they
were "made alive together with" Christ (Col. 2:13, RSV). Their
old sinful ways were rejected, and Christ was accepted as the
source of their newness of heart and lifestyle. (Compare Rom.
6:18, 22; 8:14-16.)

   How does Paul join what is so often kept separate—the
relationship between pardon and regeneration? Col. 2:13.


   "God made [us] alive together with him [Christ], having
forgiven us all our trespasses" (Col. 2:13, RSV). In other words,
God made us alive with Christ by forgiving all our trespasses.
Forgiveness in Scripture includes regeneration. When we for-
give others, we can overlook the past, but we cannot change
their hearts. But when God forgives us, He transforms our
hearts.
   "God's forgiveness is not merely a judicial act by which He
sets us free from condemnation. It is not only forgiveness for
sin, but reclaiming from sin. It is the outflow of redeeming love
that transforms the heart. David had the true conception of
forgiveness when he prayed, 'Create in me a clean heart, 0
God; and renew a right spirit within me.' Psalm 51:10."
—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 114.

   What did God nail to the cross? Col. 2:14.


  The law was not nailed to the cross, because the New Testa-
ment teaches that it remains God's standard of righteousness.
(See Rom. 3:31; 7:7; 8:1-4; James 2:10-12; 1 John 2:4, 5; Rev.
12:17; 14:12.) "The handwriting of ordinances that was against
us" (Col. 2:14) refers to the huge debt of human guilt for which
animal sacrifices could not atone. This guilt was nailed to the
cross because Jesus became sin for us (2 Cor. 5:21). He "bore
our sins in his body on the tree" (1 Peter 2:24, RSV). Thus,
when we accept Him, He is able to destroy our guilt, making
us free from condemnation (Rom. 8:1). Our spiritual enemies
were disarmed at the cross (Col. 2:15).



                                                                 77
Friday                                            August 26
FURTHER STUDY: For what did Christ suffer? 1 John 2:2;
4:10; 1 Cor. 15:3; Gal. 1:4. When is our personal guilt destroyed?
1 John 1:9; Acts 5:31; 13:38, 39; Matt. 6:14.
   Read "Written From Rome" in The Acts of the Apostles, pp.
475-477, and "Confession" in Steps to Christ, pp. 37-41.
   "Confession will not be acceptable to God without sincere
repentance and reformation. There must be decided changes in
the life; everything offensive to God must be put away. This
will be the result of genuine sorrow for sin. . . .
   "True repentance will lead a man to bear his guilt himself
and acknowledge it without deception or hypocrisy. Like the
poor publican, not lifting up so much as his eyes unto heaven,
he will cry, 'God be merciful to me a sinner,' and those who do
acknowledge their guilt will be justified, for Jesus will plead
His blood in behalf of the repentant soul."—Steps to Christ, pp.
37-41.
 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What connection do you see between our guilt's being
     borne by Christ and the end to the ceremonial ob-
    servances of the Israelite temple? (See Heb. 9:11-14.)
     2. Your friend confides in you that he still feels guilty
        after asking Christ to forgive his sins. How would you
        use this week's lesson to help him overcome that feel-
        ing of guilt?
     3. If the "bond which stood against us with its legal
        demands" (Col. 2:14, RSV) was nailed to the cross, why
        are we not forgiven for our sins until we confess them
        (1 John 1:9)?
     4. What does it mean to you to know that, as a believer,
        you are "complete in Christ" at this moment?
SUMMARY: Because Christ is the fullness of the Deity, He
was able to bear our guilt on the cross. By virtue of that infinite
sacrifice, He now forgives the sins of those who confess and
repent, and gives them fullness of life in Him. On the cross He
triumphed over the powers of darkness, and again He tri-
umphs by displaying to the universe our transformed lives.
(See Isa. 53:11.)

                 Thirteenth Sabbath Offering Update:
                               Reykjavik, Iceland

            Part of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering from third quarter,
         1989, helped to establish a church school and evangelistic
         center in Reykjavik, Iceland. What has happened to that
         offering?
            More than half of Iceland's 260,000 residents live in or near
         Reykjavik, the largest city in Iceland, this windswept island
         nation of approximately 103,000 square kilometers (40,000
         square miles) in the North Atlantic. The offering that benefited
         Iceland was designated for a school and evangelistic center,
         which has been established within a 15-20 minute drive of
         most residents in Reykjavik. The Adventist church here has
         approximately 560 members in 7 churches.
            The formal opening of the school took place in September
         1990, with classes for grades 1-8, but has since been expanded
         to serve grades 1-10. During the 1992-1993 school year, the
         school served 61 students. The headmaster and a staff of four
         full-time teachers, as well as several part-time teachers, serves
         the institution.
            Evangelistic center activity has grown more slowly, ham-
         pered at first by lack of an auditorium for meetings. But now
         vegetarian-cooking seminars, Revelation seminars, and other
         programs are bringing results.
            Interest in religious matters traditionally has taken low
         priority in Iceland, where people are steeped in traditions and
         superstition, especially spiritualism. It has been difficult to
         attract people to evangelistic meetings. A few years back a
         major evangelist came to Reykajvik to hold lectures. A large
         hall was rented, and a large number of people responded to
         the advertisement of archaeological lectures. But after two
         meetings, attendance dropped dramatically. They were not
         interested in the Bible, just archaeology and a slide show.
            However, today we face a different audience. When we
         advertise a Bible-prophecy seminar, the halls are filled to capac-
                             ity with students eager to study God's Word.

        Jesus, the Answer to
              Legalism



                                  iii
Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Col. 2:16-3:4.

     MEMORY TEXT: "For you died, and your life is now hid-
     den with Christ in God" (Colossians 3:3, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: The essence of legalism is to depend upon
self rather than completely upon Jesus for pardon and power.
Man-made religions and ceremonies encourage legalism. Only
in union with Christ is salvation possible.

   LEGALISM AND SELF-RIGHTEOUSNESS ARE TWIN
BROTHERS. Teaching a class of juniors, a Sabbath School
teacher explained how deplorable it was for the Pharisee to
pray, "God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are" (Luke
18:11). In a brief season of prayer at the end of the class, one of
the boys prayed, "We thank Thee, God, that we are not like
that Pharisee!"
   We smile, but it is no more reasonable for a church member
who is selfish in his treatment of his wife to attempt to erase
his guilt by faithful attendance at church services, or for a
freewheeling businessperson to seek acclaim by making a large
donation to the church.
   Paul's emphasis in this next section of Colossians is as valid
today as it was in his day. Legalism seems never to die. New
forms are forever developing. It is as delusive and deceiving
now as it has ever been.
   Even God-appointed means to awaken faith and promote
spiritual growth can degenerate into legalism when the pur-
pose for the service is forgotten.

THE SOLID REALITY (Col. 2:16, 17).

   After Jesus died on the cross, why was it legalism to con-
tinue the celebration of the sanctuary services that God had
instituted in Moses' day? Col. 2:16, 17.


   Paul has warned against human traditions and man-made
philosophies (Col. 2:8). The faithful God-man, Jesus Christ,
died for our sins, making a way to abolish our legal debt
(verses 13, 14). Continuing the ceremonial services that pointed
forward to His death is a virtual denial that He has "canceled
the bond which stood against us" (verse 14, RSV). "If Christ be
not raised . . . ye are yet in your sins" (1 Cor. 15:17). Ignoring
the reality by perpetuating the shadow substitutes a human
method of salvation for God's method. And that is legalism!

                "A Shadow of Things to Come"
     The phrase "a festival [feast] or a new moon or a sabbath"
  (Col. 2:16, RSV) is an idiomatic or stylized reference to the
  ceremonial sacrifices offered in the ancient Israelite sanctu-
  ary or temple. The Old Testament background is Numbers
  28 and 29, in which the burnt offerings daily, weekly, monthly
  and yearly are listed. There were five yearly feasts, involv-
  ing seven ceremonial sabbaths. Seven Old Testament pas-
  sages use some form of the phrase "feasts, new moons,
  sabbaths" (1 Chron. 23:31; 2 Chron. 2:4; 8:12, 13; 31:3; Neh.
  10:33; Eze. 45:17; Hosea 2:11). Each passage refers to the
  burnt offerings to be offered weekly, monthly, and yearly.
  Usually the feasts specify only the three pilgrimage feasts
  (Unleavened Bread, Weeks or Pentecost, and Tabernacles).
  The sabbaths must, therefore, include the ceremonial
  sabbaths—otherwise Solomon, for example, would have failed
  to offer burnt offerings on the days of Trumpets and Atone-
  ment (2 Chron. 8:12, 13). The word sabbaths in the phrase
  "feasts, new moons, sabbaths" specifies the burnt offerings
  for weekly and annual (ceremonial) sabbaths. In Colossians
  2:16, 17, Paul taught that the sacrifices offered weekly (sabbath),
  monthly, or yearly were a "shadow" pointing forward to
  Christ (see Heb. 8:5; 10:1), which lost their significance at the
  cross. But the weekly Sabbath remains as a perpetual memo-
  rial of Creation (Gen. 2:1-3; Ex. 20:8-11; Matt. 24:20; Heb. 4:9)
  and a sign of sanctification (Ex. 31:13). The "food and drink"
  (Col. 2:16, RSV) refer to the meal and drink offerings that
  were presented to God along with the burnt offerings. (See
   Num 28:2, 5, 7, 9, 13, 14, etc.)

                                                                        81

FALSE HUMILITY VERSUS DEPENDENCE (Col. 2:18, 19).
  How does Paul warn against those who attempt to impress
others with their religious rituals? Col. 2:18.

   The practice of worshiping angels suggests gnostic influ-
ence. The gnostics taught that angels were inferior deities ema-
nating from the supreme Deity.
   In Paul's day, as well as our own, some have suggested
activities that will "prove" their "humility," and thus the genu-
ineness of their devotion. Whatever the demonstration, the
end is the same—human works. The message of Christianity is
simple: because nothing in man can accomplish what the law
requires, salvation is solely an act of God, both in forgiving
and in empowering. Christ is our righteousness. Our efforts in
cooperation with Him are an act of faith, not the means of
victory or salvation.
   Genuine humility recognizes the helplessness of even the
strongest-willed people in dealing with selfishness. The humble
individual is grateful for the joy in Christ that comes with
complete dependence upon Him. Only those who say with
Jesus, "I can of mine own self do nothing" (John 5:30), and
with Paul, "I can do all things in him [Christ] who strengthens
me" (Phil. 4:13, RSV), are humble.
  What vital mistake do those make who test doctrine and
practice by their own reason or feelings? Col. 2:18, 19.

   We are to be part of Christ's body, attached to the Head.
(Compare John 15:1-8.) We may be His hands and feet, but He
is the head (Eph. 4:15). Our hands do not decide what they
should do; our head does.
   Paul's analogy of the body and the head, the joints and
ligaments, is clear: if any order is desired, if any purpose is to
be fulfilled, each person should be listening in genuine humil-
ity to Him who is our head, to Him who alone knows what is
truth and best. Surely it is "vain conceit" and satanic philoso-
phy for people to attempt to figure out their own plan of
salvation, adjusting the simple biblical plan to what seems best
to them.
   Can you identify religious practices today that are legal-
istic? How can even our legitimate religious services be-
come legalistic?

DEAD WITH CHRIST (Col. 2:20-22).

  How does Paul expose the paradox of professing to be
dead to legalism while performing the rituals of legalism?
Col. 2:20-22.


   Any form of legalism is high-sounding vanity, no matter
how many biblical texts are used, no matter how sanctimo-
nious the objectives are. Legalism seems to exist in all religious
groups, pagan or Christian.
   The ritual performances of the Pharisee, the ascetic self-
mortifications of the medieval monk, the rule-keeping, mod-
ern Christian without the faith of Jesus, or the "only believe"
proponent who thinks that obedience is imputed to the Chris-
tian—all end up trying to please God by devices of thought or
behavior that bypass the saving grace of Christ and His power
to give victory over sin. In the end Paul's counsel to such
persons is a foreign experience; they have not died with Christ
to sin.
   No matter how many "don'ts" a person can add up, no
matter how many years of exemplary "self-denials," all these
negatives do not necessarily add up to positive growth in
grace. Overcoming sin, becoming like Jesus (Rev. 3:21; 1 John
3:3), is much more than living a life of avoiding that which can
be physically tasted or handled.

  What does it mean for us to "die with Christ"? Compare
Col. 2:20; 3:3 with Rom. 6:2, 6, 11; Eph. 4:22.

   The death of the "old man" (Rom. 6:6) is deliverance for the
repentant believer from the "the former manner of life" (Eph.
4:22, RSV). Self is replaced by Christ as the center of existence.
Even though we remain fallen human beings with tendencies
to sin (1 Cor. 9:17; Gal. 5:17, 18), we may enjoy habitual victory
and spiritual growth because Christ reigns in our hearts.

    "The new birth is a rare experience in this age of the
 world. This is the reason why there are so many perplexi-
 ties in the churches. Many, so many, who assume the name
 of Christ are unsanctified and unholy. They have been
 baptized, but they were buried alive. Self did not die, and
 therefore they did not rise to newness of life in Christ."
 —Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol.
6, p. 1075.

                                                                83

APPEARANCES OF RELIGION (Col. 2:23).

   How does Paul summarize all legalisms, especially in re-
gard to the ability to aid a person in overcoming sin? Col.
2:23.


   Paul now sums up chapter 2: Jesus is the answer to all
legalism. Buried with Him in death to self, the Christian knows
the power of Deity within him, even to experiencing "fulness
of life" (Col. 2:10, RSV). The first-century Christian no longer
needed circumcision or ceremonial feast days and cleansings
to point to Christ. He needed faith in the meaning of Christ's
life and death, a faith that is a response of repentance, trust,
and submissive obedience. The present-day Christian has the
same desperate need.
   The only circumcision that now matters (in fact, the only
circumcision that ever mattered) is that of the heart. Nothing
can be added to Christ's pardon offered freely to the penitent;
nothing can be added to the power of the Holy Spirit that will
join with the believer's will in a divine-human union to de-
stroy the clutches of both inherited and cultivated tendencies
to evil. (See Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 330, 331.)
   Paul is stating the truth as clearly as words permit: One
thing only matters—are we "checking the indulgence of the
flesh"? Whatever religious duties, attainments, and rituals for
which one may be known, nothing matters if all this effort
does not lead to overcoming sin and to growth in grace. (See
Colossians 3:5-10.)

  By what means can we daily "check" all selfish desires
and indulgences? Rev. 3:18-20.


   "The churches may yet obtain the gold of truth, faith, and
love. . . . The white raiment is the righteousness of Christ that
may be wrought into the character. Purity of heart, purity of
motive, will characterize every one who is washing his robe,
and making it white in the blood of the Lamb. . . . [You may say
that you believe in Jesus] when you have an intelligent, under-
standing faith that His death makes it possible for you to cease
from sin, and to perfect a righteous character through the
grace of God, bestowed upon you as the purchase of Christ's
blood."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, July 24, 1888.

Thursday                                         September 1
CHRIST IS OUR LIFE (Col. 3:1-4).

  How does Paul characterize the believer who has truly
understood his responsibility for his salvation? Col. 3:1, 2.


   "If." Paul means, in view of the fact that we know we have
been born anew by looking to Jesus, let us not turn to any
method to stay right with God other than to keep looking to
Jesus.
   "Seek." Christians should make a habit of seeking. Such
seeking is done not only at the beginning of the Christian walk;
seeking "those things which are above" must be a daily prac-
tice or we lose what we once gained.
   "The right hand of God" is a phrase that occurs a number
of times in the New Testament. (See Rom. 8:34; Eph. 1:20; Heb.
1:3, 13; 8:1; 10:12; 1 Peter 3:22.) It denotes the authority that
Jesus and the Father share.
   "Things above." Those "things that are above" (Col 3:2,
RSV) will never pass away. One of the most important objects
of our heavenly gaze is our Lord's high priestly ministry in the
Most Holy Place today. We are told: "Satan invents unnum-
bered schemes to occupy our minds, that they may not dwell
upon the very work with which we ought to be best acquainted.
The archdeceiver hates the great truths that bring to view an
atoning sacrifice and an all-powerful Mediator. He knows that
with him everything depends on his diverting minds from
Jesus and His truth."—The Great Controversy, p. 488.

  What reasons does Paul give that Christians should think
and live differently from unbelievers? Col. 3:3, 4.


   "You must experience a death to self, and must live unto
God. . . . [Quote Col. 3:1.] Self is not to be consulted. Pride, self-
love, selfishness, avarice, covetousness, love of the world, ha-
tred, suspicion, jealousy, evil surmisings, must all be subdued
and sacrificed forever. When Christ shall appear, it will not be
to correct these evils and then give a moral fitness for His
coming. This preparation must all be made before He comes. It
should be a subject of thought, of study, and earnest inquiry,
What shall we do to be saved? What shall be our conduct that
we may show ourselves approved unto God?"—Testimonies,
vol. 1, p. 705.



                                                                   85
Friday                                           September 2
FURTHER STUDY: Study the teaching of Ephesians 4:22-32
on the death of the "old man" and the life of the "new man."
Ask yourself:
  1. Who is the "old man"?
  2. Who is the "new man"?
  3. What habits and practices do we put away when the "old
     man" dies?
  4. What habits and practices do we take on when the "new
     man" comes to life?
   Read "Like Unto Leaven" in Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 99,
100; "Facing Life's Record" ("The Investigative Judgment") in
The Great Controversy, pp. 488, 489; "Christian Temperance" in
Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 354-356.

   Now is the time to prepare. "We are preparing to meet Him
who, escorted by a retinue of holy angels, is to appear in the
clouds of heaven to give the faithful and the just the finishing
touch of immortality. When He comes He is not to cleanse us
of our sins, to remove from us the defects in our characters, or
to cure us of the infirmities of our tempers and dispositions. If
wrought for us at all, this work will all be accomplished before
that time."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 355.


 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Why does God require weekly Sabbath observance
     since the cross, even though celebration of the ceremo-
     nial sabbaths has been done away?

     2. Paul instructs, "Set your minds on things that are above"
        (Col. 3:2, RSV). What do you do if your thoughts keep
        getting out of control? How can you successfully fol-
        low the Bible counsel?

     3. Your friend is religiously careful in caring for his health
        but seems selfish and thoughtless in the way he treats
        his wife and family. Without interfering in matters
        that are none of your business, how would you try to
        help your friend change?

SUMMARY: Because Christ died for our sins, the ceremonial
services of the ancient Israelite sanctuary or temple that pointed
forward to Him no longer need to be observed. Legalism is any
religious practice that is used to earn favor with God. By con-
stant fellowship with Christ, we remain dead to sin and alive
for God. Thanks be to God! Jesus is the answer to all our needs!

                A Huge School District
                          Andrew Cox
   The day of reckoning dawned—graduation day at
Newbold College. As I marched up the steps to receive my
degree, a voice kept nagging, "Where now? Where now?"
   I had decided earlier to study French for a year, for I knew it
would help me in my career, but it soon became apparent that God
wanted me to learn the language for reasons other than my busi-
ness degree. Halfway through my year in France I received a call
from Ivory Coast (Cote d'lvoire) asking whether I would be
willing to work on a United Nations/ADRA joint project.
After praying and considering the call carefully, I accepted.
   The UN-ADRA project, called Frontline Education, tries to
meet the educational needs of refugees who have fled Liberia in
the wake of the Liberian civil war. Thousands of Liberian
civilians have died, and tens of thousands have fled to the
borders of Ivory Coast, Guinea, and Sierra Leone. More than
250,000 of these refugees live in Ivory Coast alone. ADRA runs
the educational program, and the UN High Commission on
Refugees provides the funding. Almost two years after the
program began, Frontline Education serves 37,000 registered
primary-school students in 135 schools and employs a staff of
800. ADRA has begun a secondary-school program that will
increase student population by another 10,000.
   My task is to look after the finances and share in the
overall administration of this multimillion-dollar project. I
enjoy my work. There is always a crisis to be solved, people
to meet, field work to do. And the cultural aspect of the job
makes it even more fascinating.
   Refugees who have been uprooted from their cultures are often
more open to Christianity. Some refugees will return to their home-
land, a nation closed to most Christian work. If we can reach them
for Christ in the refugee camps, they will take their new
faith with them and spread the gospel where we cannot go.
                        I know I probably would not be here
                     in Ivory Coast if I had not gone to Newbold
                     College. The excellent academics and the
                     culturally diverse student body helped
                     equip me for this unique assignment.

                    lege with a BBA (management) and is work-

Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Col. 3:5-11.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Do not lie to one another, seeing that
     you have put off the old nature with its practices and have
     put on the new nature, which is being renewed in knowl-
     edge after the image of its creator" (Colossians 3:9, 10,
     RSV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Because our old life of habitual sin has
died and we are "hid with Christ in God" (Col. 3:3), we are to
put away every behavior that is characteristic of that old way
of life. By allowing Christ constantly to renew our spiritual
life, we are being progressively remade in His divine image.

   CHRIST MAKES POSSIBLE OUR CONSTANT SPIRITUAL
GROWTH. The seed of the globe turnip is about one-twentieth
of an inch (1 1/4 mm) in diameter. When planted it grows to
many times its original size. Research has demonstrated that,
under good conditions, the plant can increase its own weight
15 times in one minute. Planted in peat ground, these turnips
will grow to many times the weight of their seeds in one day.
   Growth is one of the laws of life. This week's lesson demon-
strates that Christians whose "life is hid with Christ in God"
can experience constant spiritual growth. They can have vic-
tory over the sinful behaviors that were habitual to them be-
fore they accepted Christ, and they can become in character
more and more like Jesus.

PUT TO DEATH THE EARTHLY (Col. 3:5).

   What change does Paul expect in Christian believers? Col.
3:5 (compare Rom. 8:13; Gal. 5:24).


  "Mortify" (KJV) means "put to death" (RSV). The tense of
the verb does not mean "put to death gradually," but "put to
death now." What are we to put to death? Paul has just said
that, as believers, we have died with Christ (Col. 2:20; 3:3) and
"have been raised" with Him (Col. 3:1, RSV). This is what Jesus
meant by the new birth produced by the Holy Spirit (John 3). If
we have had this experience, what else is there to put to death?
   Paul says, "Mortify . . . [put to death] your members." Then
he identifies "fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection,
evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry." Our
members are our bodily parts. Are these so naturally evil that
we must put them to death?
   The basic problem is not the "members," but "your passions
that are at war in your members" (James 4:1, RSV).

   What did Paul teach the Roman Christians about the body
in relation to sin? Rom. 6:13, 19; 7:5, 23.


   When our bodies and minds are controlled by evil passions,
we do the things we know are wrong—because, as Paul ex-
plains, "the law of sin . . . dwells in my members" (Rom. 7:23,
RSV). Then we are "carnal, sold under sin" (verse 14). But
when "the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set . . . [us]
free from the law of sin and death" (Rom. 8:2, RSV), our mem-
bers become "instruments of righteousness" (Rom. 6:13). There-
fore, Paul counsels: "Just as you once yielded your members to
impurity and to greater and greater iniquity, so now yield
your members to righteousness for sanctification" (Rom. 6:19,
RSV). The problem is that born-again believers are still fallen
human beings with biases, tendencies, desires, or propensities
toward sin (1 Cor. 9:27). When we give in to those tendencies,
we use our members as "instruments of wickedness" (Rom.
6:13, RSV) by committing the sins that Paul lists in Colossians
3:5.

   The point is that by relying upon Christ, we can put to
 death evil desires now (whenever they arise) and enjoy
 spiritual victory.

                                                                   89

THE WRATH OF GOD (Col. 3:6, 7).

  How does Paul spell out the sure consequences awaiting
those who do not permit the Holy Spirit to empower them to
overcome particular sins? Col. 3:6, 7.


   Those who do not seek the Holy Spirit to empower them to
"put to death" their sinful thoughts and practices are surren-
dering to the spirit of the rebel. They are in basic disagreement
with God's way of removing sin from the universe, regardless
of religious profession. Upon those who either trivialize sin or
excuse it as a problem too deep for the Holy Spirit to eradicate,
judgment has been spoken—"the wrath of God is coming"
(Col. 3:6, RSV).

   Does God actually administer punishment to those who
disobey Him? What does Scripture teach? Rev. 20:9, 10 (com-
pare Gen. 7:4; 19:24, 25; Lev. 10:1, 2; Num 16:29-35).


   Two emphases are important regarding God's punishment:
   1. Throughout time, the Lord often withdraws His protec-
tion from the rebellious, allowing Satan and wicked humans
to destroy them. The law of natural consequences applies.
Discussing the destruction of Jerusalem (A.D. 70), Ellen White
writes: "God does not stand toward the sinner as an execu-
tioner of the sentence against transgression; but He leaves the
rejectors of His mercy to themselves, to reap that which they
have sown."—The Great Controversy, p. 36.

   2. In the final destruction of the wicked, the law of natural
consequences will still apply, but then God will do cosmi-
cally what He did in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah
and of the antediluvian world—He will actively destroy sin
and sinners. "God's judgments will be visited upon those who
are seeking to oppress and destroy His people. . . . By terrible
things in righteousness He will vindicate the authority of His
downtrodden law. The severity of the retribution awaiting the
transgressor may be judged by the Lord's reluctance to execute
justice. The nation with which He bears long, and which He
will not smite until it has filled up the measure of its iniquity in
God's account, will finally drink the cup of wrath unmixed
with mercy."—The Great Controversy, p. 627. (See Rev. 14:10.)

PUT THEM ALL AWAY (Col. 3:8).

  To what extent does God expect us to put away sin? How?
Col. 3:8 (compare Rom. 6:12-14; 1 Cor. 15:34; 1 Peter 2:11).


   "Put them all away" (RSV). Literally, "lay aside, once and
for all, like old clothes." God would have us give up all sin
now—the attitudes that lead to sins of both the flesh and the
spirit. The "all" of Colossians 3:8 refers both to the sins listed
there and those of verse 5.
   The availability of Christ's power to overcome any tempta-
tion at any time in no way denies the reality of our spiritual
growth as we abide in Christ (John 15:1-8). We do not step
from the lowest rung of the spiritual ladder to the uppermost
rung. (See 2 Cor. 3:18; 2 Peter 3:18.) Being made more like
Christ means: (1) experiencing more frequent victory over sin
because we are more consistent in allowing the Spirit to reign
in our lives and (2) becoming more like Jesus in positive vir-
tues. The goal of this sanctifying process is to be an overcomer
as Jesus was. (See Rev. 3:21; compare 1 John 3:1-9; 5:18.)

   Does God really expect us to get the victory over these sins
of the spirit before death, before He comes? Rev. 14:5 (com-
pare Eph. 4:13; 5:27).


   The Lord bestows spiritual gifts to bring us "unto the meas-
ure of the stature of the fulness of Christ" (Eph. 4:11-13). If we
die as true believers before arriving at that exalted standard,
we are not lost. Like the thief on the cross, the believer enjoys
presently the free gift of Christ's perfect righteousness. (See
Col. 2:10; Rom. 8:9, 10.) If he falls into sin, Christ's forgiveness
is readily available. (See 1 John 1:9; 2:1.) Nevertheless, the goal
of complete victory is achievable through Christ's power.
    "None need fail of attaining, in his sphere, to perfection of
Christian character. By the sacrifice of Christ, provision has
been made for the believer to receive all things that pertain to
life and godliness. God calls upon us to reach the standard of
perfection and places before us the example of Christ's charac-
ter. In His humanity, perfected by a life of constant resistance
of evil, the Saviour showed that through cooperation with
Divinity, human beings may in this life attain to perfection of
character. This is God's assurance to us that we, too, may
obtain complete victory."—Acts of the Apostles, p. 531.

THE OLD AND NEW NATURES (Col. 3:9, 10).

  How does Paul emphasize the distinctive difference be-
tween a Christian and a nonbeliever? Col. 3:9.


   We "put off the old man" (KJV) when we accepted Christ as
Saviour and Lord. The "old man," the old life of habitual
sinning (Eph. 4:22), is dead, but we remain fallen human be-
ings with tendencies toward sin. (Gal. 5:17, 18.) By Christ's
power we are now to overcome all behavior that is characteris-
tic of that old sinful lifestyle. Paul wrote to the Ephesians that,
because the "old nature which belongs to your former manner
of life" has been discarded, "therefore, putting away false-
hood, let every one speak the truth with his neighbor" (Eph.
4:22-25, RSV).
   "Lie not." "All liars are to have their part in the lake of fire,
and yet there are more falsehoods told and acted than many
suppose. All deception and overstatements are falsehoods. A
truthful man, a man of integrity, will not designedly produce
impressions by language or signs that are not strictly true. He
will not allow any to receive from him that which he knows to
be incorrect. A falsehood consists in an intention to deceive. A
look of the eye, a motion of the hand, an expression of the
countenance, will tell a falsehood as effectually as words. Hints
and insinuations which leave an exaggerated impression on
minds are falsehoods. Says the apostle, 'Lie not one to an-
other.' "—Ellen G. White, Signs of the Times, July 22, 1880.

  What is the result of putting on the "new man" (Col. 3:10,
KJV)? Compare Eph. 4:24.


   "Only by the grace of God, united with your own persistent
efforts, can you become conqueror over your will. Through the
merits of Christ you may part with that which scars and de-
forms the soul, and which develops a misshapen character.
You must put away the old man with his errors and take the
new man, Christ Jesus. Adopt His life as your guide[;] then
your talents and intellect will be devoted to God's service."
—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 92.


   Have you found Christ as the source of your spiritual
life? Do you daily turn to Him to be "renewed in knowl-
edge" after the image of your Creator?

ALL EQUAL IN CHRIST (Col. 3:11).

   In what sense did Jesus become the norm, the standard for
all humanity? Col. 3:11 (compare Gal. 3:28, 29).


   A more profound, enormously meaningful statement with
immense social implications cannot be found in all literature.
Paul here exposes the senseless distinctions that men and women
have created: racial—"neither Greek nor Jew"; religious—"cir-
cumcision nor uncircumcision"; cultural—"Barbarian,
Scythian"; social—"bond nor free."
   It would be impossible to list all the attitudes and practices
that have separated men and women, families, nations, and
ethnic groups since sin entered the world. In other places Paul
mentions the philosophies that too often separate church mem-
bers. He emphasizes that the wisdom of this world does not
create "the new man." (See Col. 2:4, 8, 18; 1 Cor. 1:21.) At the
foot of the cross men and women are equal in need and in their
access to the solution.

   How does the cross destroy the religious and cultural bar-
riers that separate nations, races, and religious groups? Eph.
2:11-21.


   Cultural differences that do not contradict any Christian
principle do not divide believers when Christ is Lord of their
lives. National and cultural distinctions do not veil the fact of
each group's basic need for salvation, for moral help.
   "Christ came to this earth with a message of mercy and
forgiveness. He laid the foundation for a religion by which Jew
and Gentile, black and white, free and bond, are linked to-
gether in one common brotherhood, recognized as equal in the
sight of God. The Saviour has a boundless love for every hu-
man being. In each one He sees capacity for improvement.
With divine energy and hope He greets those for whom He has
given His life. In His strength they can live a life rich in good
works, filled with the power of the Spirit."—Testimonies, vol. 7,
p. 225.

   What are the benefits enjoyed by the Adventist Church
 because its members believe in the spiritual unity of all
 Christ's followers, whatever their national or ethnic back-
 ground?

FURTHER STUDY: Note the similarities between the teaching
of Romans 6 and that of this week's passage. Read portions of
"It Is Finished" in The Desire of Ages, pp. 763, 764, and "Conse-
cration" in Steps to Christ, pp. 43-48.

   "The old nature, born of blood and the will of the flesh,
cannot inherit the kingdom of God. The old ways, the heredi-
tary tendencies, the former habits, must be given up; for grace
is not inherited. The new birth consists in having new motives,
new tastes, new tendencies. Those who are begotten unto a
new life by the Holy Spirit, have become partakers of the
divine nature, and in all their habits and practices they will
give evidence of their relationship to Christ. When men who
claim to be Christians retain all their natural defects of charac-
ter and disposition, in what does their position differ from that
of the worldling? They do not appreciate the truth as a sancti-
fier, a refiner. They have not been born again."—Ellen G. White
Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1101.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Paul wrote, "Do not lie to one another" (Col. 3:9, RSV).
     How do you explain the way God blessed Rahab de-
     spite her lie about the Israelite spies (Joshua 2:3-7)?

     2. Is it deception to leave a light on in your house when
        you are away so that prospective thieves will think
        there is someone at home?

     3. A woman friend of yours is struggling with moral
        impurity and is convinced that her sins are so serious
        that God cannot forgive her. How would this week's
        lesson help you minister to her need?

SUMMARY: Having accepted Christ's transforming grace in
the new-birth experience, we are instructed to put away all sin
that is characteristic of our old nature and manner of life. As
we learn to depend more fully on Christ, allowing His Spirit to
reign in our hearts, we grow spiritually more like Him. Present
temptation can be resisted and overcome by relying fully on
Christ's power.

                    Russian City for Christ
                          Oivind Gjertsen
     ln December 1944, Norwegian military officers traveled
  north from Scotland, through Murmansk, on the Kola Penin-
  sula in far northwestern Russia, site of the vast Russian
  Atlantic Naval base, to establish a Norwegian military pres-
  ence in the northernmost part of Norway. The officers were
  treated well by the Russians. Soon the great World War was
  over, and Norway was again a free country.
     ln January 1993, another Norwegian freedom fighter
  traveled to Murmansk, an isolated city inside the Arctic
  Circle. However, he was on his way to a different kind of
  assignment. Pastor Tor Therandsen, a young Adventist min-
  ister from northern Norway, traveled to Murmansk to preach
  the Adventist message to the people there and to strengthen
  the Adventist presence in that great city. And the 90 Seventh-
  day Adventists in Murmansk welcomed him.
     Throughout this public campaign, an audience of approxi-
  mately 1,100 persons attended the weekend meetings, and
  700 to 800 persons came on weekdays. We expect a large
  baptism as a result of these evangelistic meetings and look
  forward to a growing Adventist presence in northwestern
  Russia.
     We rejoice to see that the power of the cross is permeating
  a country where atheism dominated for decades. Today,
  freedom comes to people ripe for the kingdom of God. In
  March and April 1993, Magne Krekling conducted a cam-
  paign in the city ofApartixy, 200 kilometers (125 miles) south
  of Murmansk.

                Serving Jesus




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Col. 3:12-4:1.
     MEMORY TEXT: "Whatever you do, in word or deed, do
     everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to
     God the Father through him" (Colossians 3:17, RSV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Last week's lesson emphasized what Chris-
tians turn from when they "put off the old man with his deeds"
(Col. 3:9). Now we turn to what Christians "put on" when they
let God rule in their hearts.
   CHRIST'S ABIDING PRESENCE DIRECTS OUR BEHAV-
IOR. Dr. A. J. Gordon, pastor of the Clarendon Street Baptist
Church in Boston from 1869 to 1895, once dreamed that a
dignified stranger walked into his church and listened atten-
tively as he preached. In the dream, Gordon asked a deacon
after the sermon, "Do you know him?" "Why, yes," said the
deacon, "He is Jesus Christ."
   Gordon lamented, "Oh, how I wish I could have talked with
Him." "It's all right, pastor," assured the deacon, "He'll be
back next week."
   Gordon's ministry was transformed as he realized that
every time he preached, Jesus was there and heard every word.
   Christians are to live out in practice what Christ's presence
has introduced into their hearts and what they have declared
in principle and profession. In the new life with Christ, our
primary focus is on Jesus.
   "The religion of Christ means more than the forgiveness of
sin. . . . It means a heart emptied of self, and blessed with the
abiding presence of Christ."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 419,
420.

VALIDATING OUR PROFESSION (Col. 3:12, 13).
  After describing what the Christian must "put off," what
does Paul say about those characteristics that distinguish
genuine Christians? Col. 3:12, 13.

   Here Paul parallels verse 8: the change of life that the Chris-
tian experiences is akin to changing clothing. The rags of the
unbeliever, seen as "immorality [fornication], impurity, pas-
sion, evil desire, and covetousness" (verse 5, RSV) and as "an-
ger, wrath, malice, slander, and foul talk" (verse 8, RSV), through
Christ's power should be discarded once and for all. Anger,
impatience, covetousness, and lying are no more acceptable to
God than murder, adultery, or intoxicating beverages.
   God has designed the "new man" (verse 10), the new gar-
ment of character, as an ever deepening reflection of "the im-
age of its creator" (verse 10). Christ in believers' hearts makes
them in character like Himself—pure, compassionate, kind,
humble, patient, and forgiving.
   God will not put this new character garment on a professing
Christian without his consent and cooperation. He simply says,
through Paul, that if we are willing to work with Him, willing
to cherish the desire to be what He wishes us to be, He will
convert the desire into a fact. As we look to Jesus, He becomes,
by means of indwelling grace, the beautiful example of what
true humanity may be like. He shows us how to "put on" those
characteristics that mark us as His sons and daughters.
   How can the parent, the supervisor, or the spouse "for-
bear" (see Col. 3:13) when discipline must be administered
or principle upheld? Compare Deut. 8:5; Prov. 19:18; Titus
3:10, 11.

   Jesus has helped us to understand that meekness does not
necessarily mean mildness in a case when children are abused
or when scolding is draining the self-confidence out of others.
The "loving thing to do" requires a clear sense of what Jesus
would do under the same circumstances. Our first loyalty is to
His principles, not to our concept of how love should be ex-
pressed in order to please others for the moment. In the "doing
of one's duty" let there be the softness of heart, the tear in the
eye, such as Jesus displayed when He spoke the truth plainly.


                                                                 97

THE PERFECT BOND (Col. 3:14).
  Why is love the supreme virtue? What does it do for us?
Col. 3:14.

   Unfortunately for modern users of the English language,
"charity" no longer has the meaning it once had. The Greek
word agape is best translated "love," although even "love" has
been diluted into trivial meanings in modern times.
   Love (agape) is a word beyond human depth and breadth
because it describes the character and motivation of God, whom
we best know through Jesus Christ. In fact, "God is love"
(1 John 4:8). His highest concern is the well-being of others.
Even God, the Creator of the universe, would sacrifice, lay
aside, give away, certain prerogatives if it meant the salvation
of any of His created beings. (See John 3:16; Rom. 5:8.)
   What does love have to do with our thoughts and emo-
tions? Phil. 4:6-8.

    Love does not only help the Christian to keep the law; love
is the keeping of the law. (See Rom. 13:8-10.) This seems hard
for some to grasp. For this reason love (agape) is described as a
principle and not merely a feeling. Love is the way that a
Christ-reflecting Christian relates to God and man. Nothing
more could possibly be required of a Christian than to love as
Jesus loved. Love, then, is what Bible writers call perfection; it
beautifully summarizes "the measure of the stature of the fulness
of Christ" (Eph. 4:13, RSV). Bible perfection involves the ab-
sence of selfishness and the presence of complete commitment
to whatever God has said to be truth. Thus, love is righteous-
ness, or perfection (in the biblical sense).
   "Righteousness is holiness, likeness to God, and 'God is
love.' 1 John 4:16. It is conformity to the law of God, for 'all thy
commandments are righteousness' (Psalm 119:172), and 'love
is the fulfilling of the law' (Romans 13:10). Righteousness is
love, and love is the light and the life of God. The righteous-
ness of God is embodied in Christ. We receive righteousness
by receiving Him."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 18.

  Can you describe to your Sabbath School class what
divine and human love have done for you?

PEACE RULES (Col. 3:15).

  In what way did Paul relate peace and gratitude? Col. 3:15.


   This "peace of God" (or, of Christ, as many ancient manu-
scripts read) is not merely the peace of a quiet lagoon. Rather,
the peace that Christ imparts is the same peace He enjoyed
when He faced up to unpleasant verbal assaults and terrible
loneliness. Christians find peace in situations beyond their
control, by looking to Jesus. Jesus promised: "Peace I leave
with you; my peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I
give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them
be afraid" (John 14:27, RSV).
   Peace is not only a personal matter, helping the believer to
cope with life. Peace is also a powerful force that makes home
a place more desired than any other; peace changes a conten-
tious church into a refreshing, supportive fellowship.
   "Rule." Literally, "to umpire." When differences of opinion
arise in a home or a church, "the peace of God" can serve as the
umpire who arbitrates the differences and thus resolves the
tension. "While self is alive, we stand ready continually to
guard it from mortification and insult; but when we are dead,
and our life is hid with Christ in God, we shall not take ne-
glects or slights to heart. We shall be deaf to reproach and
blind to scorn and insult."—Thoughts From the Mount of Bless-
ing, p. 16.

   In what way does gratitude promote peace? Compare
1 Cor. 1:4 with verses 10, 11.


   Paul did not rebuke the Corinthians for their disunity before
praising God for His blessings to them and for the spiritual
progress they had made. Such gratitude to God on their behalf
would convince the Corinthians of Paul's genuine concern for
them and put them in the right frame of mind to receive his
counsel.
   When we express sincere gratitude for what God is doing
for us and for those who are opposing us, jealousy and envy
are less likely to arise. Grateful persons feel that they receive
more than they deserve. When a person is grateful for sins
forgiven, for power to overcome, for eternal life, no human
situation can become so big or so bad that the light of God's
love is shut out.


                                                              99
Wednesday                                   September 14
THE WORD OF CHRIST (Col. 3:16).

  What may be the result when "the word" is permitted to
dwell in the Christian's life? Col. 3:16.


   Unfortunately, throughout the history of the Christian church,
"the word of Christ" has often been only something to learn, to
agree to, to accept as one would accept the words of a physicist
regarding the makeup of the atom. But one of Jesus' primary
emphases is that His "words" must become to us as food and
drink (John 6:53-63). His words, when properly understood
and obeyed, affect the spiritual life even as vegetables and
fruits affect the physical life. Furthermore, the believer must
believe "the word of Christ" personally and hear his or her
own name on each promise, on each command.
   The searing debate over law and gospel that has sapped the
energy of the Christian church for centuries would be elimi-
nated if all were to appreciate the purpose of Holy Scripture.
The command of the law and the promise of the gospel are not
in conflict; they are two sides of one pane of glass. Accepting
the "word" as God's will for the Christian will release creative
energy that transforms the serious believer. In this way only
can we become "partakers of the divine nature" (2 Peter 1:4).

  How may one know that he truly has "heart religion,"
which is the goal of righteousness by faith? Rom. 10:8-10.


   Creative power is in "the word of Christ." This is not gener-
ally understood. If Satan can fix our eyes on the historical Jesus
without understanding the work He truly came to do, namely,
to "save his people from their sins" (Matt. 1:21), then we will
be no better off than those 2,000 years ago who accepted Him
as a great teacher but not as their personal Lord.
   "The creative energy that called the worlds into existence is
in the word of God. This word imparts power; it begets life.
Every command is a promise; accepted by the will, received
into the soul, it brings with it the life of the Infinite One. It
transforms the nature and re-creates the soul in the image of
God."—Education, p. 126.

you close to Christ and given you strength to be an over-
comer?

LOVING RELATIONSHIPS—WHATEVER OUR ROLE (Col.
3:17-4:1).

  In what way does Paul emphasize our responsibility as
children of God? Col. 3:17.


   Paul here summarizes this remarkable paragraph, which
began with "put on therefore" (verse 12). To declare oneself to
be a Christian is different from declaring oneself to be a mem-
ber of the local garden society. Paul makes clear that a genuine
Christian experiences a fundamental lifestyle change in both
word and deed. The Christian has no vacation from being a
child of God. He does not separate his actions from his thoughts
and desires. He does not pretend and thus attempt to deceive
his fellow members of the body of Christ.
   "The world needs evidences of sincere Christianity. Pro-
fessed Christianity may be seen everywhere; but when the
power of God's grace is seen in our churches, the members will
work the works of Christ. Natural and hereditary traits of
character will be transformed. The indwelling of His Spirit will
enable them to reveal Christ's likeness, and in proportion to
the purity of their piety will be the success of their work."
—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 416.

   What principles are to govern relationships within fami-
lies and work situations? Col. 3:18-4:1.


   A wife is instructed to fulfill her husband's wishes that do
not contradict her ethical ideals based on verse 17. A wife or
husband cannot "in word or deed, do everything in the name
of the Lord Jesus" (RSV) by pandering to the demands of a
dictatorial husband or a self-pitying wife.
   "To say that a Christian wife must do everything that her
husband demands is to contradict verse 17. She is in vital
association with Christ. . . . Whatever she does for her husband
involves Christ, Whom she must never compromise, even though,
to avoid doing so involves disobedience to her husband."
—Yeager, The Renaissance New Testament, vol. 15, pp. 107, 108.
   When a husband or wife accepts the spouse's and children's
prior loyalty to Christ, then he or she expects of them nothing
that Christ does not expect. The same principle applies to
employers' expectations of their employees. Family members
and employees can then render their services as unto Christ.

   "Those who are connected with the service of God must be
purified from every thread of selfishness. All is to be done in
accordance with the injunction, 'Whatsoever ye do in word or
deed, do all' (Col. 3:17) 'to the glory of God' (1 Cor. 10:31).
God's laws of justice and equity must be strictly obeyed in the
transactions between neighbor and neighbor, brother and brother.
We are to seek for perfect order and perfect righteousness,
after God's own similitude. On these grounds alone will our
works bear the test of the judgment."—Selected Messages, book

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. A husband and father confesses to you that there is a
     division in his family. He believes that, because of the
     opposition of his wife and children, he is not able to
     "put on . . . compassion, kindness, lowliness, meek-
     ness, and patience," forbearance and forgiveness (Col.
     3:12, 13, RSV). What counsel would you give him?

   2. How can the "peace of Christ rule in your hearts" (Col.
      3:15, RSV) when your society or your country is being
      torn apart by social and political divisions, and possi-
      bly by military conflict?

  3. How is it possible for parents to "provoke" their chil-
     dren (Col. 3:21)? When children are provoked, is it
     always the fault of the parents? How should parents
     apply this counsel in day-to-day relationships with their
     children?

SUMMARY: Having come to Christ and put off the old nature
with its habitual sinning, we are now to practice the positive
virtues that characterized the life of Jesus. This is possible only
as we allow Him and His word to rule in our hearts. Then our
contribution to all our relationships will be according to His
will.

Global Mission
        giF          A Dream, a Fountain, New Faith
                                  Jonathan Catolico

              Work in the predominantly Islamic province of Mindanao in
           the Philippines is slow. It is difficult to get a foothold among the
           Muslim adherents there. But recently God brought the first
           fruits of our labors there—an entire congregation of former
           Muslims!
               Aljari Misuari, pastor of the congregation that numbered 57
           members, visited relatives on a nearby island. While there he
           learned that some of his relatives had become Adventists; his
           curiosity was aroused. He went to see them and to learn more
           about their new faith.
               There Pastor Misuari learned of an Adventist minister who
           lived on nearby Bongao Island. He decided to visit the Adventist
           pastor, Consorcio Racoma, and to ask him questions on doc-
           trine. However, Pastor Racoma was away and wouldn't return
           for three days. Not to be dissuaded, Pastor Misuari waited until
           Pastor Racoma returned. After their visit, Pastor Misuari begged
           for the Adventist pastor to visit his island and study with his
           people. Pastor Racoma promised to come in three days.
               However, Pastor Racoma was delayed and could not get to
           the island on the day promised. Pastor Misuari's elderly
           mother admonished them to wait, and they did. That night the
           pastor's mother dreamed of a fountain where she and fellow
           church members drank, bathed, and refreshed themselves.
           The water was shallow and muddy. Then she saw another
           fountain containing clear, cool, abundant waters. When she
           moved closer, she saw a man waiting there. She told her dream
            to church members. "If I see that man, I will know him. His
            face is very clear to me."
               The next day a boat landed at their island. And off stepped the
            man the woman had dreamed about. It was Pastor Racoma! He
            received a warm welcome on the island and began a series of
            Bible studies with the entire congregation. At the end of the
            studies 57 precious souls were baptized into the Adventist faith.
               Now the island of Simonol in the Philippines has an Adventist
            witness. Other islands in this province beckon for laborers to
            share the gospel, for the harvest is great. Pastor Misuari wants
            his congregation of new believers to take responsibility for part
            of this work. With God's help, we are finishing the work!

             Jonathan Catolico is the director of education for the South
           Philippine Union Mission.

       Witnessing for Jesus




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Col. 4:2-18.

  MEMORY TEXT: "Let your speech always be gracious,
  seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought
  to answer every one" (Colossians 4:6, RSV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Paul's admonition regarding prayer and
witnessing is reflected in the faithfulness of his fellow workers.
In our witnessing programs, our conduct and speech must
always represent the love and purity of our Lord.

   WE MUST GO TO THEM. Gary was a member of a Sab-
bath School class that decided to place bookracks filled with
Adventist literature in laundromats and grocery stores. The
owner of one laundromat read every book in the rack and
joined the Adventist Church. Chuck read a book out of the
rack in the store where his wife worked. Then he filled out and
mailed the Bible-study request card that Gary had placed in
the book. Gary subsequently delivered two Bible-study guides
to Chuck's home every week. Chuck studied them, filled in the
answers, and was baptized at the end of the series. Chuck's
wife, Mary, studied with Gary's wife and also was baptized.
   The Lord wants Sabbath School members to be involved in
witnessing for Him. In this week's lesson, Paul gives valuable
counsel for prospective soul winners, and he illustrates it by
referring to his own loyal co-workers.

A DOOR FOR THE WORD (Col. 4:2-4).
  How do our prayers change circumstances? Col. 4:2-4.

   We should find it natural to ask fellow Christians to pray for
us, to pray that we may have daily opportunities to share the
gospel, to expect God to change circumstances, and to give us
increased ability to communicate more effectively.
   Daniel (Dan. 2:17, 18) and Esther (Esther 4:15-17), like Paul,
also felt the need to fellowship in prayer. Church members
who pray for one another have found one more secret of per-
sonal, as well as group, strength. (See also Eph. 6:18-20;
1 Thess. 5:25.)
   But what is the object of our prayers? Personal comforts?
Material advantage? Paul's chief concern, whenever he asked
fellow Christians to pray for him, was for new opportunities,
new doors to open, so that more people could hear the won-
derful story of salvation. He was not praying to be released
from prison, although that would have been pleasant. He wanted
fresh opportunities, new doors to walk through, "for the word"
(Col. 4:3, RSV).
   Does God change circumstances? Let there be no question
about it. "It is a part of God's plan to grant us, in answer to the
prayer of faith, that which He would not bestow did we not
thus ask."—The Great Controversy, p. 525.
  What special gift does the Lord wish to bestow on His last-
day people? Under what conditions can we receive this gift?
Joel 2:28, 29; Zech. 10:1; Acts 1:8.

   "Our heavenly Father is more willing to give His Holy Spirit
to them that ask Him, than are earthly parents to give good
gifts to their children [Luke 11:131. But it is our work, by
confession, humiliation, repentance, and earnest prayer, to ful-
fill the conditions upon which God has promised to grant us
His blessing. A revival need be expected only in answer to
prayer."—Selected Messages, book 1, p. 121.

   Do you have prayer groups in your church seeking the
 outpouring of the Holy Spirit? If so, what blessings have
 you received? If not, can you encourage your fellow church
 members to begin?

                                                                105

WISE CONDUCT (Col. 4:5).

  What counsel does Paul give regarding the manner of
presenting the gospel to others? Col. 4:5. What reasons do
you think he had in mind?


    "Them that are without" refers to non-Christians, to those
outside of Christ. Jesus died for them, as well as for committed
Christians. But how can those who do not know Christ come to
know Him? What would cause them to pause and want to
listen to an "insider"? The success of Christianity depends to a
considerable extent on the impression that "outsiders" have of
"insiders." As Paul said, "You yourselves are our letter of
recommendation, written on your hearts, to be known and
read by all men" (2 Cor. 3:2, RSV).
    "How careful should we be in every word and act to follow
closely the Pattern, that our example may lead men to Christ.
With what care should we seek so to present the truth that
others by beholding its beauty and simplicity may be led to
receive it. If our characters testify of its sanctifying power, we
shall be a continual light to others—living epistles, known and
read of all men."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 236.
   "Outsiders" often misunderstand "insiders" simply because
they lack information. Early Christians were sometimes seri-
ously misunderstood by their fellow citizens. Walking in "wis-
dom toward them that are without" means that Christians will
consciously do what they can to avoid misunderstanding.

   In what ways do you think that you can improve under-
standing between you and your neighbors? Would it be more
than merely setting forth a consistent Christian life? Study
Jesus' method (John 4:4-30).


   "Redeeming the time" may be more literally translated "mak-
ing the most of the opportunity." In other words, do not wait
for opportunities to fall in your lap. Pray for opportunities
(Col. 4:3) and seek them as you would material treasures.
Those who seek in wisdom will find "outsiders" who will
listen. The biblical emphasis is always to "seek ye first the
kingdom of God" (Matt. 6:33), and nothing is more important
than people.

SEASONED SPEECH (Col. 4:6).

   What responsibility did Paul place on the Christian him-
self in the work of proclaiming the gospel? Col. 4:6.

   In days when refrigeration was unknown (except for a cool
brook or a cave), salt was very important for its preservative
qualities. Salt prevented deterioration or corruption.
   Similar to Colossians 3:17, Paul here focuses on the part that
the Christian should consciously contribute to the work of
proclaiming the gospel. What one says, is important, but how
one says it is equally important. Witnessing for Jesus is more
than dumping information upon an unbeliever and then dust-
ing off one's feet as if one's duty has been done.
   "The manner in which the truth is presented often has much
to do in determining whether it will be accepted or rejected."
—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 404.
  How did Paul counsel the Ephesians regarding the kind of
speech that should characterize Christians? Eph. 4:29.

   Only the grace of the Holy Spirit as the source of the Christian's
preserving quality can avoid the deterioration, even corrup-
tion, that invades so many well-intentioned conversations. Grace,
the work of the Holy Spirit in human lives, will make us
gracious.
   "Be sure to maintain the dignity of the work by a well-
ordered life and godly conversation. Never be afraid of raising
the standard too high. The families who engage in the mission-
ary work should come close to hearts. The spirit of Jesus should
pervade the soul of the worker; it is the pleasant, sympathetic
words, the manifestation of disinterested love for their souls,
that will break down the barriers of pride and selfishness, and
show to unbelievers that we have the love of Christ; and then
the truth will find its way to the heart. . . . All coarseness and
roughness must be put away from us. Courtesy, refinement,
Christian politeness, must be cherished. Guard against being
abrupt and blunt. Do not regard such peculiarities as virtues;
for God does not so regard them."—Evangelism, pp. 636, 637.


   In what ways must I become more gracious this week?


                                                                 107

LOYAL CO-WORKERS (Col. 4:7-18).

   Who were Tychicus and Onesimus? What were their spe-
cial characteristics? Col. 4:7-9 (compare Philem. 10, 15, 16).


   Paul was not a loner. Nor was he a prototype of bishops to
come, who felt that it was their duty to impose their will on
every committee meeting or to control the lives of others. No-
tice how Paul considers his fellow workers.

   "Tychicus . . . beloved brother and faithful minister and
fellow servant" (Col. 4:7, RSV). Compare Paul's similar regard
for Epaphras (Col. 1:7). Paul was so confident of Tychicus'
loyalty, not only to him as a person but also to his theological
understanding, that he could safely recommend him as one
who would faithfully relate the state of affairs in Rome to all
concerned. Some things can be better said than written, and
Paul knew that Tychicus could be implicitly trusted.

   "Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother" (Col. 4:9, RSV).
Read again Paul's magnificent letter to Philemon and note
how Paul offers himself as collateral in Onesimus' behalf. Now
in this letter to the Colossians (which was no doubt circulated
throughout the scattered Christian churches), Paul is recom-
mending Onesimus, Philemon's former slave, as a trusted co-
worker. Paul is setting forth Onesimus, returning with Tychicus,
as one who could faithfully report the real state of affairs, a
wonderful example of a transformed Christian, and thus an
encouragement to all.

  What can we learn of the gospel's effectiveness from the
backgrounds and characteristics of Paul's fellow laborers?
Col. 4:10-18.


   The next six co-workers were a mixture of Jews and Gen-
tiles, an interesting statement in itself. The gospel for which
Paul was giving his life truly worked. (See Col. 3:11.) Former
enemies, separated by race, culture, and misunderstandings of
all kinds, had become trusted co-laborers, willing to identify
with an imprisoned preacher. What hath God wrought!

Thursday                                     September 22
THE AIM OF IT ALL (Col. 4:12).

   How did Paul summarize the aim of all Christian admoni-
tion? Col. 4:12.


   "Labouring fervently." Literally, "always wrestling." No
wonder Paul found Epaphras to be such a trusted co-worker
(Col. 1:7). Such prayer life and personal activity are the ingre-
dients of all successful soul winning.
   "Perfect." The Greek adjective means "having reached its
end, finished, mature, complete, perfect." (The same word is
used in Col. 1:28; Matt. 5:48.) Just as the aim of seed is to bear
fruit after its kind, so the aim of the gospel seed is to bear fruit
that resembles the truth implanted by the Holy Spirit. "The
divine Husbandman looks for a harvest as the reward of His
labor and sacrifice. Christ is seeking to reproduce Himself in
the hearts of men; and He does this through those who believe
in Him. The object of the Christian life is fruit bearing—the
reproduction of Christ's character in the believer, that it may
be reproduced in others."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 67.

  How can we have the assurance of present salvation in
Christ? Col. 4:12 (compare Rom. 8:16; 1 John 3:24; 4:13).


   "Complete." Literally, "having been fully assured." What a
promise! We are given not only the aim of the Christian walk
but also the assurance along the way that God is performing
what He promised. Jesus is our surety; He has proved that
what He asks of us can be done by the grace of the Holy Spirit.
The Spirit within witnesses to the peace, order, purity, and
love that matures in a believer's life.
    "Let this point be fully settled in every mind: If we accept
Christ as a Redeemer, we must accept Him as a Ruler. We
cannot have the assurance and perfect confiding trust in Christ
as our Saviour until we acknowledge Him as our King and are
obedient to His commandments. Thus we evidence our alle-
giance to God. We have then the genuine ring in our faith, for
it is a working faith."—Faith and Works, p. 16.

   How many people are on your prayer list? How often do
 you mention "names" in your prayers? How do you work
 with God in answering your prayers for them?


                                                                 109
Friday                                      September 23
FURTHER STUDY: Compare the following passages with Paul's
emphasis in this week's lesson: Rom. 12:11, 12; Eph. 6:18-20;
1 Thess. 5:17-22. Read also "The Privilege of Prayer" in Steps to
Christ, pp. 100-104; "First the Blade, Then the Ear" and "Tal-
ents" (on speech, influence, and time) in Christ's Object Lessons,
pp. 62-69, 335-346.

  "The power of speech is a talent that should be diligently
cultivated. Of all the gifts we have received from God, none is
capable of being a greater blessing than this. With the voice we
convince and persuade, with it we offer prayer and praise to
God, and with it we tell others of the Redeemer's love. How
important, then, that it be so trained as to be most effective for
good."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 335.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. You are studying with a friend who is having a prob-
     lem with smoking and caffeine. He asks you whether
     you had struggles with sinful habits in becoming a
     Christian. What would you share with him?

  2. Mary is your next-door neighbor, a divorcée with two
     children. She has no time for religion. How would you
     seek to lead her to believe in the Word of God?

  3. You are studying with a group of charismatic Chris-
     tians. They ask you what evidence you have that the
     Holy Spirit is dwelling within you. How would you
     answer them?

  4. Hakeem is your friend. When you try to witness to him
     about Jesus Christ, he asks, "How can you prove that
     this Jesus was resurrected from the dead and still lives?"
     How would you answer him?

SUMMARY: Paul concludes his letter to the Colossians with
counsel regarding earnest prayer, gracious speech, and dis-
creet witnessing. He refers to a number of his co-laborers whose
lives illustrate the principles that he has been teaching. Our
major goals in life are to be like Jesus, witnessing for Him,
passing on the assurance of present salvation by fellowship
with Him.

6Ishal Missies
       .F1107           First Afghan Family Baptized
                                       Dan Pak

             One evening a young man arrived at our home wanting to
          find a safe house in which to stay. He and his family of six had
          fled Afghanistan and needed protection. I learned that the
          family were former Muslims and were being hunted by a
          militant group intent on killing them, for they had declared
          their allegiance to Christ and had left home, lands, and
          wealth in Kabul.
             Upon further inquiry, we learned the family needed shel-
          ter for that night; the Muslim man who had befriended them
          had given them a clear indication that they were no longer
          welcome in his home. So together we searched for a house.
          Eventually we found a place that the owner said could be
          made available in 48 hours. They still needed shelter for two
          nights, so I invited the six of them to our home. They arrived
          that night at 11:30 and shared our home. For two nights we
          visited and talked on various topics of the Bible. They became
          convinced that if the Sabbath was in God's commandments,
          they had to keep it. Pastor Haapasalo, our ministerial direc-
          tor, was then invited to conduct Bible studies for them and
          prepare them for baptism. Since all of them were refugees
          and had practically nothing, we provided them with clothes
          and food for three weeks. Even with that, they do not have
          enough money for their living expenses and need help.
             They have faithfully attended church and Sabbath School,
          youth meetings and prayer meetings. They were baptized in
          a secret service by Pastor Haapasalo, who wanted to avoid
          publicity in order to protect this young family. They are now
          active members of our church.
             Already the family is working to reach other Afghans for
          Jesus. They are preparing radio programs, translating Bible
          stories, and writing spiritual messages in their Farsi dialect of
          Dari to broadcast into Afghanistan.
             Pray that we will be able to nurture them successfully into
          the Adventist lifestyle. Many of our members are slow to
          accept Muslim converts into the fold, because of prejudices.
          This is the first family of Afghans to be added to the Seventh-
           day Adventist Church.

              Dan Pak is a pastor in Pakistan.

NEWBOLD
COLLEGE
Close to Oxford . . .


                        but a World apart
            Newbold has many things in common with
            Oxford University. Both are in England. You
            can get high quality degrees from either.
            Both attract students the wide world over.

            But there is a difference! Newbold is small,
            Oxford huge. Newbold offers a distinctively
            Adventist education. At Oxford, well . . .?!

            Oxford's campus has a dozen glorious old
            churches - but they are mostly empty on Sundays.
            Newbold doesn't even have a college church.
            Services are held in an assembly hall and it is too
            small. It can't hold all those who want to worship
            there.

            Oxford gets lots of money from goverriment and
            wealthy alumni. Newbold doesn't.

            Newbold doesn't want to build a glorious
            cathedral, but we do need your help to build a
            college church - a place where the whole college
            community can worship together.


      Please give generously
     this 13th Sabbath so that
    Newbold can build a church.
      We don't need a dozen churches like Oxford,
       but just one to call our own would be nice.
