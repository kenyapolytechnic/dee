    Meet the Principal Contributors
      to This Quarter's Lessons
   The lessons this quarter were written by members of the staff of
Florida Hospital and its parent organization, Adventist Health Sys-
tem Sunbelt Healthcare Corporation, in Orlando, Florida. Each of the
authors is a person to whom the healing touch of Jesus Christ is a
daily experience; each is a professional who counts it a privilege to
be part of the great tradition of the Master's healing ministry.
   Because most of these people work at Florida Hospital, the largest
in the worldwide network of Adventist hospitals, this institution is
occasionally mentioned by name. Experiences within the walls and
towers of Florida Hospital are those with which the writers are most
familiar. Naturally, similar sentiments would be heard at other church-
operated clinics and hospitals.
   These lessons are a gift from Florida Hospital to the world church.
None of the authors received any remuneration for their work.

           Healing and Restoration
                      The Master's Touch
    This quarter's Sabbath School lessons focus on Jesus' healing
ministry while He was here on earth. From the manner in which
Jesus worked, we can deduce principles that will guide our efforts to
minister to others. Always uppermost in Jesus' mind was the goal of
saving souls for eternity. To do this it was necessary for Him to reach
into the hidden recesses of people's minds, transform their thinking,
deliver them from the unholy forces that controlled them, and inspire
them with new hope for the future.
    Jesus functioned on the basis of the principle that one of the best
ways to reach a heart is to minister to the individual's physical needs.
His ministry to sick bodies was especially designed to save souls for
His kingdom. The first paragraph of Ellen G. White's The Ministry of
Healing, one of the best commentaries on this quarter's lessons,
introduces us to the saving ministry of Jesus:
    "Our Lord Jesus Christ came to this world as the unwearied servant
of man's necessity. He 'took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses,'
that He might minister to every need of humanity. Matthew 8:17. The
burden of disease and wretchedness and sin He came to remove. It was
His mission to bring to men complete restoration; He came to give them
health and peace and perfection of character."—The Ministry of Heal-
ing, p. 17.
    Jesus was concerned for the restoration of the whole person—
spiritually, psychologically, and physically. Significantly, the Greek
verb to save is used a number of times in the New Testament in the
sense of "to heal." For example, the woman who had suffered for 12
years approached Jesus in the crowd, saying to herself: "If I only
 touch his cloak, I will be made well" (Matt. 9:21, NRSV). But the
 last phrase translates literally from the Greek, "I shall be saved." All
 three synoptic Gospels use the verb to save in Jesus' final statement
 to the woman: "He said to her, 'Daughter, your faith has made you
 well' " (Mark 5:34, NRSV). But all three Gospel accounts read in
 Greek, "Your faith has saved you." There are a number of other New
 Testament passages that use the Greek verb to save in contexts that
 speak of Christ's healing work. (See Mark 5:23; 6:56; 10:52; Luke
8:36; 17:19; Acts 4:9; 14:9, 10; James 5:15.)
     Physical as well as spiritual suffering are identified as the work of
 Satan, from whose power Jesus released the subjects of His healing
 mercy.
     Christ's healing ministry is a soul-saving ministry. It was so long
 ago, and it remains so today. We can only fulfill the gospel commis-
 sion as witnesses for Jesus as we seek to save the whole personality
 of each individual to whom we minister.

                                                                         5
Lesson 1                               September 28—October 4


           Creator and Healer




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Mark 2:1-12; Luke 10:1-9.

     MEMORY TEXT: "And the whole multitude sought to touch
     Him, for power went out from Him and healed them all" (Luke
     6:19, NKJV).

  KEY THOUGHT: The One who has the power to create has the
power and the desire to re-create, and thereby to heal.

   TWO OBJECTIVES Jesus had on earth were to reveal the true
character of God and to dispel the misunderstandings about Him that
had developed over generations. The view of God had become so
distorted that He was seen primarily as a God who punishes sin. Jesus
wanted humanity to understand that God is also loving, compassion-
ate, and infinitely concerned about His creation—His children.
   Christ's work was to restore the relationship that was broken in
Eden when Adam and Eve sinned by placing their desires above
God's instructions. The healing aspect of Christ's ministry was one of
the most effective means for this restoration to take place. The physi-
cal healing Christ brought to the sick demonstrated His love for them
and His power to save them from the power of sin. Then, as now, often
the only way to reach a heart was by means of physical healing.

"LET US MAKE MAN IN OUR IMAGE" (Gen. 1:26).

   It is humbling to contemplate that the God who created the entire
universe and spoke incredibly complex organisms into existence wanted
to create us so that He might enjoy our fellowship.
   We cannot begin to comprehend God's creative power. The most
advanced scientific studies just begin to scratch the surface. We consider
ourselves fortunate when we build new telescopes that reveal more of the
universe, but we cannot adequately explain how it got there and what
keeps it in balance. The study of medicine has produced some under-
standing of how the body functions, but we cannot fully comprehend
where the spark of life comes from or what makes a cut heal.
   God understands all this; He designed human life and spoke it into
existence. Of all His creation, He considers us the most special.
   God spoke the earth, the plants, and the animals into existence, but
He stooped down and with His hands molded clay into the form of
man and then breathed life into the clay. In addition to His personal
touch, God chose to make us in His image, both in appearance and in
character. He gave our first parents the ability to reason and love.

   What pattern did God follow in creating humanity? What method
did He employ? Gen. 1:26; 2:7.


    "After the earth with its teeming animal and vegetable life had
been called into existence, man, the crowning work of the Creator, and
the one for whom the beautiful earth had been fitted up, was brought
upon the stage of action."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 44.
   God could create anything He desired, yet He chose to create us and
to make us like Him. He gave us the ability to think and reason and to
make choices. He designed us as social beings, with a desire for
companionship and love. He shared with us some of His own attributes.
One way we may come to understand this love is to enter into God's
creative activity by having our own children. As we enjoy the inter-
action and love of our families, we can begin to understand why God
created us and why He wants us to be with Him throughout eternity.

  What did Ellen White mean when she wrote that human nature
was originally in harmony with the will of God? See Patriarchs
and Prophets, p. 45.


   Since God made the original couple perfect, what went wrong?
 How did they come to act so imperfectly? Compare Genesis 3
 with Romans 5:12.

                                                                        7

RESTORATION BEGINS (Gen. 3:9-15).

   What action did God take after Adam and Eve sinned? Gen.
3:9. What was the basis of Adam's fear? Verse 10.


   Recognizing their sin, the parents of the human race were fright-
ened, and they hid from God. Their carefree joy was replaced by a
sense of guilt and foreboding, and through sin they were changed.
Thankfully, the loving Creator had not changed. He did not love them
less. He did not stop caring for their welfare. Although He was deeply
saddened by their actions, He sought to bring them comfort and the
reassurance of His love. He gave them hope as He revealed a plan
whereby their relationship could be restored (Gen. 3:15).

   When was this plan developed? Eph. 1:4; Titus 1:2; 1 Peter
1:20 (compare Rev. 13:8; 17:8).


   How difficult was it for God to implement salvation's plan? "Before
the Father He pleaded in the sinner's behalf, while the host of heaven
awaited the result with an intensity of interest that words cannot
express. Long continued was that mysterious communing—`the counsel
of peace' (Zechariah 6:13) for the fallen sons of men. The plan of
salvation had been laid before the creation of the earth; for Christ is 'the
lamb slain from the foundation of the world' (Revelation 13:18); yet it
was a struggle, even with the King of the universe, to yield up His Son
to die for the guilty race."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 63.

  Why did God make the ultimate sacrifice? John 3:16. What did
God plan to accomplish? 2 Cor. 5:19; 1 Peter 2:24.


   "Oh, the mystery of redemption! the love of God for a world that
did not love Him! Who can know the depths of that love which
`passeth knowledge'? Through endless ages immortal minds, seeking
to comprehend the mystery of that incomprehensible love, will won-
der and adore."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 64.
   If God was hurt by the sin of Adam and Eve, imagine how He must
hurt when we fail to respond to His invitation of salvation.

   Is there anything more God might do to give salvation to a
 nonbelieving friend of yours? Is there anything you can do?

THE RESULTS OF THE BROKEN RELATIONSHIP (Gen.
3:8, 19).

   By placing their own desires and priorities ahead of God's instruc-
tions, Adam and Eve broke the perfect relationship with God that had
been theirs. They became sinners. They quickly learned that when the
relationship with God is damaged, there are other profound conse-
quences.

  What happened to their relationship with God? Gen. 3:8.What
happened to their relationship with each other? Gen. 3:12, 16.
How did their lives begin to change? Gen. 3:16-19.


   "As they witnessed in drooping flower and falling leaf, the first
signs of decay, Adam and his companion mourned more deeply than
men now mourn over their dead."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 62.
   "The fall of man filled all heaven with sorrow. The world that God
had made was blighted with the curse of sin and inhabited by beings
doomed to misery and death. There appeared no escape for those who
had transgressed the law. Angels ceased their songs of praise. Throughout
the heavenly courts there was mourning for the ruin that sin had
wrought."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 63.
   Imagine the utter despair and hopelessness of being condemned to
death, combined with the anguish of knowing that you had caused the
ruin of a perfect world. Even though Adam and Eve were devastated,
God grieved even more deeply. He could foresee the hurts and sorrows
His children would bear, and He was moved with infinite compassion.

  Did God cause Adam and Eve to feel sorrow, or was it the
natural consequence of disobedience? Explain.


  Why do some of our actions cause God such sorrow? Why
could God not overlook that first sin?


  "In His great mercy, He appointed Adam no severe test. And the
very lightness of the prohibition made the sin exceedingly great. If
Adam could not bear the smallest of tests, he could not have endured a
greater trial had he been entrusted with higher responsibilities."
—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 60.

    What greater responsibilities do you think God had in mind
 for Adam and Eve?

                                                                       9

THE CREATOR JOINS HIS CREATION (John 1:14).

   "And the Word became flesh and lived among us" (John 1:14,
NRSV). A young boy was afraid to sleep in his own room apart from
his father and mother. In an effort to give him courage and comfort,
his parents bought him a teddy bear to keep him company. They
named the bear Paddington and told their son that Paddington was a
special bear who would be with him in the dark. Shortly after the boy
was tucked in one night, a frightened voice called to his father. The
father reminded his son that Paddington was there to keep him com-
pany. With understanding beyond his years, the son responded, "But
Dad, Paddington doesn't have skin."

   Why was it necessary for God to take on humanity? Heb. 2: 17, 18.


   "Since Jesus came to dwell with us, we know that God is ac-
quainted with our trials and sympathizes with our griefs. Every son
and daughter of Adam may understand that our Creator is the friend of
sinners. For in every doctrine of grace, every promise of joy, every
deed of love, every divine attraction presented in the Saviour's life on
earth, we see 'God with us.' "—The Desire of Ages, p. 24.
   What a comfort to know that we have a God who not only told us
how to live, but became one of us and showed us how!

   Why is it important to understand that Christ personally expe-
rienced each of our temptations and struggles? What are the
implications of this belief for you? Heb. 4:14-16.


   Is Christ's commitment to the human condition temporary or
permanent? How long will Christ be a human being like us? Phil.
3:20, 21 (compare Luke 24:39; John 20:20, 27).


   "By His life and His death, Christ has achieved even more
than recovery from the ruin wrought through sin. It was Satan's
purpose to bring about an eternal separation between God and
man; but in Christ we become more closely united to God than if
we had never fallen. In taking our nature, the Savior has bound
Himself to humanity by a tie that is never to be broken. . . . To
assure us of His immutable counsel of peace, God gave His only-
begotten Son to become one of the human family, forever to
retain His human nature."—The Desire of Ages, p. 25.

CHRIST RESTORES BOTH BODY AND SPIRIT (Mark 2:
1-12).

  How is Christ's work of restoration described in Matthew 8:17?


   "Our Lord Jesus Christ came to this world as the unwearied servant
of man's necessity. He 'took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses,'
that He might minister to every need of humanity. Matthew 8:17. The
burden of disease and wretchedness and sin He came to remove. It was
His mission to bring to men complete restoration."—The Ministry of
Healing, p. 17.

 Why did Christ's ministry involve both healing and teaching?
Mark 2:1-12.


  We might follow that question with this question: Which is most
important on an airplane, the right wing or the left? Or, which is more
important, inhaling or exhaling?

   Christ understood that both physical and spiritual healing were
essential parts of His ministry. His healing of the body illustrated
His power to save from sin. Which occurred first in the experi-
ences recorded in the following texts?

   Matt. 9:2-7
   Matt. 15:30, 31
   Mark 5:25-34
   Luke 5:12, 13

   The genius of Christ's work was His love-motivated attention to
the needs of others.
   "The Saviour's work was not restricted to any time or place. His
compassion knew no limit. . . . On the green hill slopes of Galilee, in
the thoroughfares of travel, by the seashore, in the synagogues, and in
every other place where the sick could be brought to Him, was to be
found His hospital. In every city, every town, every village, through
which He passed, He laid His hands upon the afflicted ones and healed
them."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 17.

    Did Christ heal only those whom He knew would respond
 spiritually, or were His healings acts of "disinterested benevo-
 lence"? (See The Ministry of Healing, pp. 17-50.)

                                                                    11

FURTHER STUDY: Read Luke 10:1, 2, 8, 9 to discover the work
Christ has given His followers.

   "Christ's method alone will give true success in reaching the people.
The Saviour mingled with men as one who desired their good. He
showed His sympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won
their confidence. Then He bade them, 'Follow Me.'
   "There is need of coming close to the people by personal effort. . . .
The poor are to be relieved, the sick cared for, the sorrowing and the
bereaved comforted, the ignorant instructed, the inexperienced coun-
seled. We are to weep with those that weep, and rejoice with those that
rejoice. Accompanied by the power of persuasion, the power of prayer,
the power of the love of God, this work will not, cannot, be without fruit.
   "We should ever remember that the object of the medical mission-
ary work is to point sin-sick men and women to the Man of Calvary,
who taketh away the sin of the world."—The Ministry of Healing, pp.
143, 144.
   In response to Christ's example and His instructions to carry on His
work, the Seventh-day Adventist Church began an organized health
work a century ago. That work exists today in many countries of the
world and continues to help bring about physical and spiritual healing.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Why does Christ call us to help in the restoration process?
     Why does He call us to be involved in a healing ministry?

   2. What should be the relationship between the spiritual gift
      of healing and the work of doctors, nurses, and medical
      technologists?

   3. Has our medical ministry failed if baptisms do not result?
      Explain.

SUMMARY: Our Creator prepared a perfect world in which He
placed physically and spiritually perfect human beings. Since the fall
of these beings into sin, humans have been afflicted by physical and
spiritual imperfection and disease. Only through Christ can the image
of God be restored in humankind. Our work is to cooperate with
God's great work of restoration.

                        Going Hungry for Missions
    'NE;7
                                Kwon JohngHaeng

           I wiped the perspiration from my brow as I waited in my car
        for the six young missionaries who were working in the small city
        of Indang in the northern Philippines. Because there was no tele-
        phone to call ahead, the missionaries did not know I was here. At
        midday they returned home and welcomed me to their cottage.
        Inside, a poster on the wall announced, "Happy Birthday, Lee."
        The young people sang "Happy Birthday" to their friend, but
        there was no cake, and no gifts.
           We talked about their work as members of the 1000 Mission-
        ary Movement, a volunteer mission program that encourages young
        people to give one year for the Lord in mission service. As I
        prepared to leave, one of the missionaries, Hahn Ae-Jong, pulled
        my shirt sleeve and called me aside. She asked to borrow 200
        pesos ($7) to help the missionaries buy food until they received
        their next $70 stipend in two weeks. Even though the missionaries
        received small stipends, I was surprised that they had not stretched
        their money to last until their next paycheck. I asked her why she
        did not have enough money to last until her next check.
           "Pastor," she said, "once there were Adventists in this town,
        but they scattered because they had no church. I do not want that
        to happen again, so I pledged to help build a church. I have no
        money for food because I have spent my stipend to buy materials
        to help build the church here in Indang."
            As I slipped some money into her hand, I was struck by the
        realization that these young missionaries were going hungry so
        that new believers would have a church.
            A church in Korea sent 16 young people to help the 1000 Mission-
        ary Movement workers conduct an evangelistic crusade in Indang.
        The Lord blessed the young people's efforts and added 32 soldiers to
         His army. The youth returned home so excited, they convinced their
                                 elders to help them make the dream of a
                                 permanent church in Indang a reality.
                                    Pray for the work of the 1000 Mission-
                                 ary Movement, which is growing rapidly
                                 toward its goal of training 1,000 youth a
                                 year to serve as missionary volunteers in
                                 the Philippines and elsewhere in the world.

               Moved Through
                Compassion




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Luke 5:12-16; 9:12-17; Matt.
8:1-17; 9:4-6, 36-38.

   MEMORY TEXT: "Through the Lord's mercies we are not
   consumed, because His compassions fail not. They are new every
   morning; great is Your faithfulness" (Lam. 3:22, 23, NKJV).

  KEY THOUGHT: Christ's great love constrained Him to heal.
His heart went out to the sick, the brokenhearted, and the bereaved.
His love compelled Him to reach out, often healing entire villages.

   JESUS REVEALED GOD'S MERCIFUL CHARACTER in His
compassion and healing. When people are hungry, cold, and without
friends, they have a hard time understanding God's tender mercies.
The poor struggle to survive in a world of selfish people and are often
treated as if they are less worthy. They are looked down upon, pitied.
But Christ says, "It was I who was hungry and thirsty. It was I who
was a stranger. It was I who was sick." (See Matthew 25:35-40.)
Although Jesus focused on eternity, He was concerned about the
present and responded to the people who needed Him most—the poor,
the ill, the grieving, and those entangled in webs of sin. He responded
with infinite compassion.
   Jesus revealed more than pity. Compassion implies pity accompa-
nied by an urge to help or spare. Sympathy sees and says, "I'm sorry."
Compassion feels and whispers, "I'll help."
   This week we consider how Jesus' compassion was manifested in
healing ministry.

"BE MERCIFUL, EVEN AS YOUR FATHER IS MERCIFUL"
(Luke 6:36, RSV).

  As we exercise compassion, our humanity grows into its fullness.

  How can Christians know whether they are truly compassionate?
Luke 10:29-37.


  Why do some unbelievers appear to be more compassionate than
some believers? Rev. 3:1, 2; James 2:14-17. If one does not spontane-
ously feel compassionate, how can Jesus' instruction recorded in
Luke 6:36 be implemented?


   The call to compassion goes against our natural tendency. It
requires genuine conversion of heart and mind. The word compassion
generally evokes positive feelings. We like to think of ourselves as
compassionate people who are basically good, gentle, and understand-
ing. We tend to assume that compassion is a natural response to human
suffering. We feel offended when someone accuses us of lacking com-
passion. We identify being compassionate with being truly human.

   Since this is true, why is humanity torn by conflict, hatred, and
oppression? Why do differences in race, gender, and religion prevent
us from relating to one another? Why is our world in such chaos?


   We need to take a critical look at our understanding of compassion.
The word compassion is derived from Latin words meaning, "to suffer
with." Compassion asks us to go where it hurts, to enter places of pain,
to share brokenness, fear, and anguish. Compassion challenges us to
cry with those in misery, to mourn with those who are lonely, to weep
with those in tears. Compassion requires us to identify with the weak,
the vulnerable, and the powerless.
   Compassion means complete immersion in the effort to relieve
human need. It means taking action. When we look at compassion this
way, it is clear that something more than mere kindness is involved. It
is not surprising that compassion is something that often evokes in us
deep resistance, even protest. Compassion is not among our most
spontaneous responses, but it is God's response that may become our
response in our submission to Him.

   Describe how God's compassion is expressed in Psalm 78:38.
 Compare Paul's compassion (1 Cor. 9:19-23).

                                                                    15

HE LIVED AMONG US (Isa. 7:14).

   By what title, taken from the prophet Isaiah, does Matthew
refer to Jesus? Isa. 7:14; Matt. 1:22, 23.


   The title means literally "God with us." It introduces us to Matthew's
strong conviction regarding the identity and mission of Jesus. God
saves us by literally becoming one of us in the person of Jesus. In
Jesus we encounter God as the companion of our lives, the fulfillment
of our human yearnings. He is God's presence become flesh. He is
divine compassion in human form and feeling, the ultimate revelation
of God as companion to humanity. Jesus reveals a God who loves
generously, compassionately, and calls us to a new way of living so
that we can find true fulfillment.

   Study the apostle John's description of God with us. John 1:1-5,
9-18.


   We will never really know God as a compassionate God if we do
not understand with our hearts and minds that "He lived among us."
He committed Himself to identify with us, to suffer all of life with us,
to share in our joys and pains. In Jesus, God's compassion became
visible. Jesus not only said, "Be merciful as your Father is merciful";
He was the living embodiment of this divine mercy in our world.
Jesus' response to the ignorant, the hungry, the blind, the lepers, the
widows, and all those who came to Him with their suffering, flowed
from His divine compassion.
   We need to pay close attention to Jesus' words and actions if we are
to gain true insight into this divine compassion. We would misunder-
stand the miracles in the Gospels if we were to be impressed only by
the fact that sick and tormented people were healed. If this were the
fact of central importance, a cynic might rightly remark that many
people in Jesus' day were not cured. What is important is not merely
the cure of the sick, but the divine compassion that moved Jesus to
effect these cures.
   "Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and
you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. Give,
and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken
together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the
measure you use, it will be measured to you" (Luke 6:36-38, NIV).

    When you have extended compassion to someone, what did
 the experience do for you spiritually?

JESUS' COMPASSION—HEALING STORIES (Matt. 14:14).

   "When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them, because
they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd" (Matt.
9:36, NIV).

  Consider Jesus' intervention in the lives of three suffering women:

   Luke 7:11-17

   Luke 13:10-17

   Luke 8:1, 2; 10:38-42


   When Jesus saw the crowds harassed and dejected, like sheep
without a shepherd, His heart was deeply moved by their miserable
condition. When he saw the blind, the paralyzed, and the deaf, He
entered into their sufferings (Matt. 14:14). When He became aware
that the people who had followed Him for days were tired and hungry,
He said, "I have compassion for these people" (Mark 8:2, NIV). He
mercifully healed the leper who fell to his knees before Him (Mark
1:41), and He ministered to the sorrowing widow of Nain, who was
burying her only son (Luke 7:13). Jesus entered into people's heart-
aches and relieved their pain. He reached out and touched the lost,
hungry, and the sick. He was intensely sensitive to the suffering of
others.
   The great mystery is that Jesus, the sinless Son of God, chose to
suffer our pains and thus enables us to see God in His true nature. In
Christ, we see our great human need and God's infinite power to heal
us. He who is divine took our broken humanity.

  What do you see as the underlying purpose in Jesus' coming to
earth in human form? 2 Cor. 5:21.


   Jesus' healing ministry reveals what He wants to do for us. His
divine compassion enables us to face our sinful selves; it transforms
our broken human condition and lifts us from despair to hope. Through
Jesus Christ we know that God experienced our brokenness when He
became sin for us. He has embraced everything human with the infi-
nite tenderness of divine compassion.

   How can brokenness become a source of hope rather than a
 cause of despair?

                                                                   17

JESUS' COMPASSION —THE GOOD NEWS FOR TODAY
(Matt. 9:4-6).

   Jesus' compassion has not diminished, and He asks us to carry on
His work. In the Beatitudes found in the Sermon on the Mount (Matt.
5:1-12), Jesus identified the ideal attitudes that God expects of His
children. Encouragingly, He does not expect us to develop these
qualities in our own strength, any more than He expected the blind, the
lepers, or the paralyzed to cure themselves. He wants to release His
power and heal our spiritual needs today as He did in His day.

  Why did Jesus not only forgive the paralytic's sin, but also heal
Him physically? Matt. 9:4-6.


   The account of this healing is among the most touching and compas-
sionate encounters recorded in the Gospels. It exemplifies the compre-
hensive kind of healing with which Jesus approached those in need.
   This compassionate cure illustrates several dimensions of healing,
including:
                  • The gift of friends who lead others to Jesus
                  • The importance of faith
                  • Courage to confront rigid attitudes
                  • Spiritual gifts for a healed, forgiven soul
                  • The gift of a restored body

  Which of these dimensions of healing seems most essential?
Which do you think was the most important to Jesus? to the
paralyzed man? Do you think it is possible to exhibit some of these
dimensions without the others?


    It was out of compassion that Jesus' healing emerged. He did not
cure to impress; His cures were the natural expression of His divinity.
The mystery of God's love is not only that He takes our pains away,
but that He shares them. The great mystery is not merely the cures, but
the infinite compassion that is their source.
   Jesus' many cures recorded in the Gospels resulted from Jesus'
being with us. The truly good news is that God is not a distant God, a
God to be feared and avoided, but a God moved by our pains, who
participates in the fullness of the human struggle. His acts of healing
and compassion are joy-filled reminders of this good news, which is to
us true consolation and comfort.

      What is the relationship between love and compassion?

JESUS' COMPASSION—LOVING CHOICES (Matt. 4:23-25).

  Describe how Jesus demonstrated compassion as He walked
among the people. Matt. 4:23-25.


    In the Gospel stories of Jesus' healings, we sense how close God
wants to be to those who suffer. Here we see what compassion means.
It is not merely bending toward the underprivileged from a privileged
position; it is not reaching down from on high to those who are less
fortunate below; it is not a gesture of sympathy or pity for those who
fail to measure up. On the contrary, compassion means going directly
to people and places where suffering is most acute and serving as a
member of the community. God's compassion demonstrated by Jesus
is total, unconditional.
    In Jesus Christ we see the fullness of God's compassion. We cry
from the depth of our brokenness for a hand that will touch us, an arm
that can embrace us, lips that will kiss us, a word that speaks to us, and
a heart that is not afraid of our fears and trembling. He feels our pain
as no other human being feels it, and in response He assures us, "I am
with you." Jesus Christ, who is "God with us," came and experienced
our human condition.

   Study further specific examples of Jesus' healing ministry. Matt.
8:1-17; Luke 6:17-19.


   Sometimes the compassionate care we receive when we are sick
can heal as much as the medicine we take. For children, mother is
usually the one who makes sure they get enough rest by having them
stay in bed. By bringing them juice, water, and soup, she helps to keep
them nourished. She lifts their spirits when she tells them cheerful
stories. Mother's tender loving care is healing ministry. Without this
ministry children are spiritually and emotionally starved.

  Based on your own life and relationships, what are some special
and caring things that you could do the next time a loved one is sick?


    In a research project, hospital patients were asked to rate
 their nurses. The results were quite unexpected. Patient satisfac-
 tion results seemed to ignore technical and medical training, or
 perhaps assumed it, and rated good nurses as those who were
 kind, cheerful, considerate, and willing to listen. The highest
 rated nurses acted with compassion.

                                                                       19
Friday                                                October 10
FURTHER STUDY: Consider the compassionate ministry God has
committed to every believer: 2 Cor. 5:20; Luke 10:1-24; Matt. 19:
10-14.

    As Christians, we are called to be Christ's ambassadors through
whom the reality of God's infinite compassion becomes tangible. In
fellowship with Jesus, we are called to be compassionate as our Father
is compassionate. In Him it becomes possible to be effective witnesses
to God's loving mercy.
    Our actions must be a manifestation of Jesus' loving presence in our
world. Merciful actions are those through which the healing, comforting,
and reconciling love of God can touch the heart of humanity.
    "The tender sympathies of our Saviour were aroused for fallen and
suffering humanity. If you would be His followers, you must cultivate
compassion and sympathy. Indifference to human woes must give
place to lively interest in the sufferings of others. The widow, the
orphan, the sick and the dying, will always need help. Here is an
opportunity to proclaim the gospel—to hold up Jesus, the hope and
consolation of all men. When the suffering body has been relieved,
and you have shown a lively interest in the afflicted, the heart is
opened, and you can pour in the heavenly balm. If you are looking to
Jesus, and drawing from Him knowledge and strength and grace, you
can impart His consolation to others, because the Comforter is with
you." My Life Today, p. 230.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  I. What if by nature you are not compassionate? Can you
     learn to be? If so, how?

   2. Why is compassion an essential characteristic for those
      involved in the medical profession?

   3. What is the relationship between compassion and the abil-
      ity to lead souls to Christ?

   4. In what ways can you demonstrate compassion this week,
      in the home, the church, and the workplace?

SUMMARY: Healing ministry depends, to a great extent, on compas-
sion for the suffering, compassion demonstrated by merciful words
and acts, compassion that emulates the loving ministry of Jesus.

                         Baker Breaks Bread of Life
                                     J. H. Zachary

             Fredoy Wondal owns a bakery in Manado, East Indonesia. But
          he prefers to let his wife, Marie, manage the bakery so that he can
          work full-time as a lay evangelist, seeking souls for God's kingdom.
          His local church recognized his talents for spiritual leadership and
          successful soul winning and offered Fredoy a stipend to support his
          work for God.
             Fredoy's goal is to visit every home in his community as he asks
          God to lead him to people interested in studying the Bible. Soon
          after he began this work, he was giving Bible studies full time.
          When he learned that a large evangelistic series was being planned
          for Manado, he began holding group Bible studies. He invited
          people to open their homes for small-group meetings and encour-
          aged the hosts to ask their neighbors and friends to attend. Fredoy
          conducted five such groups. As the group studied the Bible to-
          gether, they began sharing their needs and joys and supporting one
          another during times of personal difficulties. In a short time the
          members developed a close spiritual fellowship. And nearly every
          week the Lord has blessed Fredoy with decisions for Christ through
          his ministry.
             Lay workers like Fredoy conducted 100 such small-group meet-
          ings in and around the city of Manado in preparation for evangelist
          meetings sponsored by the Quiet Hour. When the evangelistic
          meetings began, Fredoy arranged transportation so his Bible-study
          members could attend the meetings. The speaker's messages rein-
          forced what the listeners had been taught in the Bible-study groups,
          and many of the Bible-study contacts have accepted Christ as their
          Saviour and are preparing for baptism.
              What is Fredoy's secret of success? He goes door to door, offering
          everyone a chance to study the Bible, either in a small group or
          one-on-one with the immediate family. He shares his enthusiasm
                                     and love for God with everyone he meets.
                                     He fills every hour doing what he loves
                                     most—studying the Bible with searching
                                     souls and trusting God for the results.

           His Healing Touch




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 6:12-15; 9:27-31; 14:35,
36; Mark 10:13-16; Isa. 53:4, 5.

  MEMORY TEXT: "And Jesus went about all the cities and
  villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel
  of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease
  among the people" (Matthew 9:35).

   KEY THOUGHT: Just as Jesus used His hands to form Adam
from the clay of the ground, He often healed by laying His hands on
the suffering. He understood our need to be touched. Even when He
did not physically touch those He healed, He always touched the
spirit. He invites us to extend that healing touch.

    WHAT CAN WE EXPECT FROM HIS HEALING TOUCH?
God's pardon (1 John 1:9), provision (Matt. 6:33), and presence
(Heb. 13:5).
    Jesus was the ultimate realist. Although He spoke of the abundant
life and blessings of obedience, He never minimized the opposition,
affliction, and suffering each believer would encounter. Shortly be-
fore His death, Jesus reminded His disciples of the rough road ahead.
He knew the obstacles they would face. "I have told you these things,
so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble.
But take heart! I have overcome the world" (John 16:33, NIV; com-
pare 2 Cor. 4:17, 18).
    Jesus' words of warning were based on the promise that He would send
the Holy Spirit to be an ever-present source of assurance and strength.

HIS HEALING TOUCH FOR BODY AND SOUL (Matt. 14:
35, 36).

    Numerous times the Gospels reveal that Jesus physically touched
people as part of the healing process. His healing touch became a
well-established phenomenon. But how many would have been healed
if they had waited passively for Him to come to them and touch them?
Desperate for healing, crowds of people took the initiative to make the
healing contact. "People brought all their sick to him and begged him
to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched him
were healed" (Matt. 14:35, 36, NIV).

  Under what circumstances does the Lord promise miraculous
healings today? James 5:14, 15.


    Brad was in his early twenties and working as a registered nurse in
the emergency department at a hospital. In October 1986, Brad no-
ticed that a mole on the back of his left calf was raised and itching. He
immediately went to his doctor and had it removed. Brad's physician
said, "It looks like a melanoma (cancer)." The pathology report dis-
agreed. Everything seemed all right.
    A year later Brad noticed two tiny dark spots on the scar of his first
surgery. He returned to his physician, who immediately scheduled him
for surgery. This time the pathology report stated, "A recurrent malignant
melanoma with lymph-node metastasis"—a very serious diagnosis. Brad's
doctor told him that he could expect to live only a few months.
    After Brad was released from the hospital, he was anointed. The
Lord intervened, and Brad has done well. Ten years later, he has no
further recurrence of the melanoma. Most important of all, he is closer
to God than ever before and speaks of his healing to the glory of God.
    Brad grew up in an Adventist home and attended Adventist schools.
He recalls, "I knew all about our religion in theory, but I did not know
Christ as my personal Saviour. The day of the surgery, I claimed His
promises and surrendered my heart and my life to Him." Jesus an-
swered this prayer and also gave Brad peace. He healed Brad physi-
 cally, but more important, spiritually. Praise the Lord! Brad now has
 an exciting new fellowship with Christ and continues his commitment
 of caring for others in his work as a nurse.

  Does God heal because we are good, obedient, and therefore
deserving of healing? Explain.


    Can God bless the work of physicians and nurses who are
 atheists?

HIS HEALING TOUCH THROUGH FORGIVENESS (Matt.
6:12-15).

   What does Matthew 6:12-15 teach us about forgiveness? Is
forgiveness essential to spiritual healing?


    Recently, Kathy shared her personal testimony in response to an ongoing
tragedy. One night as Kathy and her family were driving home along a busy
street, a car traveling at high speed ran a stop sign and hit the van in which
they were riding. Kathy's beautiful teenage daughter was thrown from the
van and killed instantly. In the blink of an eye, a lovely girl so full of life, so
talented, with so many dreams for the future, was gone.
    This tragedy left the family brokenhearted. Kathy was grief-stricken
and asked God, "Why would You take our daughter from us? We live
good moral lives and try to serve You. Why do others living in sin and
wickedness go happily on?" She was angry with God and cried, "Lord, I
have no hope. How can I go on?" Kathy became paralyzed with grief and
was unable to work; with stooped shoulders, she cried continuously.
    After several weeks, a call came from the state attorney's office.
An attorney told her that, in Florida, the victim's family had a right to
help decide the punishment of the accused. Kathy asked questions and
discovered the driver was a young man. This accident happened be-
cause he was preoccupied and in a hurry to get to work. He was so
grief-stricken over the girl's death he wouldn't eat and couldn't sleep.
He, too, was paralyzed with grief over the tragedy he had caused.
    The mother remembered Christ's words from the cross: "Father,
forgive them," as she discovered the young man was also grief-
stricken. She asked the attorney to "please tell him I forgive him, and I
want to see him." Kathy recalls, "Immediately God lifted the biggest
weight from my heart. Although I still felt great sadness, He gave me
peace and assurance. I knew He would be with us and one day we
would meet Him and Melissa in heaven."
    Kathy is now assisting the young man to return to school and to get
his life in order. She continues to look forward to heaven and a grand
reunion with Melissa.

  God often provides human hands to provide His healing touch.
Have you made it possible for Him to use your hands?


    Remember Jesus' cry from the cross, "Father, forgive them"
 (Luke 23:34). There is no wound too great, too deep, too damag-
 ing that it cannot be healed through the Spirit of God. Healing is
 for those who "trust and obey." (See Isaiah 40:29-31.)

HIS HEALING TOUCH IN SUFFERING AND TRIALS (Isa.
53:4, 5).

   Because Jesus' personal suffering was so extreme, we can be sure
He empathizes with us in our suffering, no matter how heart-wrench-
ing it may be.

 Review the sufferings of Jesus that made our healing possible.
Matt. 27:26-50; Isa. 53:4, 5.


   The healing power of a compassionate touch that we studied last
week is perfectly exemplified in Jesus' experience with, of all people,
a leper. "Filled with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand and
touched the man" (Mark 1:41, NIV). Then He spoke the words, "Be
clean!" and instantly the leprosy became only a vivid memory of a
past life of rejection and isolation.

  How important are words when we seek to minister to those
who are sick? Why is our presence as important as our words?


   When Holland was occupied by Nazi Germany, Corrie Ten Boom,
Holland's first woman watchmaker, turned their home above the watch
shop into a way station for Jews fleeing the Holocaust.
   In February 1944, the Gestapo caught up with them. Corrie, her
sister Betsie, and their godly 84-year-old father were taken to the
Scheveningen prison. Coffie was placed in solitary confinement. Since
childhood, her most tormenting fear had been fear of being alone, cut
off from people. Now she was alone, sick, and forbidden to speak to
others. She prayed to God and asked, Why is this happening?
   Many years later, Guidepost magazine reported Corrie's summa-
tion of her father's faith: "Whatever the current hardship, whatever
the outward appearance, father knew God was in charge, bringing His
kingdom to pass. The best is yet to be," was the promise her father
gave them every birthday. Betsie's reminder to Conie was "No pit is
so deep that God's love is not deeper still." In prison, in her broken-
hearted despair, the memory of her family's faith and the strong
conviction that "if we believe in Jesus we can share in the goodness of
the resurrection" kept her going. Corrie forgave her persecutors and
knew that God was in charge of her life.
   Coffie died at the age of 91. She received both mental and spiritual
healing in her life and gave an inspiring example of how through
Christ a person can overcome despair.


                                                                    25

HIS HEALING TOUCH WHATEVER THE CIRCUMSTANCES
(Matt. 9:27-31).

  What lessons can we learn from the experience of the two blind
men? Matt. 9:27-31.


   The two men described in Matthew 9 could hear the commotion of
the crowds that flocked to be close to Jesus, and although they could
not see Him or the miracles taking place, they felt the electrically-
charged atmosphere. After they groped their way inside the house
where Jesus had entered, their faith was rewarded when they experi-
enced a once-in-a-lifetime touch that changed blindness into sight.

   The world is filled with sorrow, pain, and disappointment;
stormy nights without stars, long days without sunshine. As you
look for a ray of hope, another crisis knocks you to the ground.
What do you do? Where do you turn? How do you climb out of the
swamp of hurts? Are there "wounds" so great they can never be
healed? Is there healing for all hurts? Matt. 11:28-30.


    "For suffering people today, as always, whether physical, mental or
spiritual, the pain is real! The problem of pain is not a theoretical
problem, a theology game. It is a problem of relationship. Many
people want to love God but can't see past their tears. They feel hurt
and betrayed."—Philip Yancey, "Where Is God When It Hurts?"
(Grand Rapids, Mich.: 1977), p. 112.
    As we have studied and observed suffering humanity, sometimes it
seems God is silent. Christianity contains paradoxes that would make
little sense apart from Jesus' life and death. Although poverty and
suffering are evils that I could spend my life fighting, at the same time
they can be blessings. This pattern of the bad transformed into good
finds its fullest expression in Jesus. We are not exempt from the
tragedies of this world, just as Christ Himself was not exempt. We
think of pain and suffering as an outrage; Jesus did, too, which is why
He performed miracles of healing.
    "In Gethsemane, he pleaded desperately for an escape. Yet, he was
willing to undergo suffering in service to a higher goal."—Yancey,
p. 230. (See also 1 Peter 5:6, 7.)

   The surgery of life hurts, so it helps to know the wounded
 Surgeon who understands.

HIS HEALING TOUCH IS NOT ALWAYS PHYSICAL HEALING
(Mark 10:13-16).

   Parents experience a heavy burden when their children and young
people suffer. The poignant scene of mothers thrusting their children
into Jesus' arms, described in Mark 10, climaxes with Jesus' extend-
ing to each of them the blessing of His personal touch. He still offers
that touch.

   If you have prayed for physical healing and have not been
healed, how have you (or could you) come to terms with those
circumstances? Matt. 26:39, 42, 44; Rom. 8:28.


   Joni Erickson-Tada is a quadriplegic (her body paralyzed from the
neck down). Though in a wheelchair, she speaks and sings of God's
goodness. "He'll Bear Me Up on Angels' Wings" is a song of hope
she composed.
   In the summer of 1967, Joni and her sister rode their horses to the
Chesapeake Bay to swim. She spotted a floating raft, swam to it, and
dove off. The water was shallow, and her head crashed into a rock.
The doctor told her she would never walk again. Joni was devastated.
She sobbed, "God, how can You do this to me? Just let me die!"
   Millions of people have become acquainted with Joni since the
accident. She appears on television programs, records a daily radio
broadcast, has played herself in a movie, and has written the story of
her life: Joni. Her artwork (done by holding a brush in her teeth)
graces a line of cards, posters, and stationery. She uses every opportu-
nity to praise God.
   At first Joni found it impossible to reconcile her condition with her
belief in a loving God. But one night Joni became convinced God did
understand. A close Christian friend said to her, "Joni, Jesus knows how
you feel. He was paralyzed. He couldn't move or change position on the
cross. He was paralyzed by the nails." The realization was profoundly
comforting. "God became incredibly close to me and eventually I under-
stood that He loves me. I had no other identity but God, and gradually He
became enough," stated Joni. "I prayed for healing and truly believed it
would come. The Bible speaks of our bodies' being 'glorified.' Now I
realize I will be healed; I'm just going through a forty- or fifty-year
delay, and God stays with me even through that."

    How can we help suffering people understand that God loves
 them?


                                                                     27

FURTHER STUDY: Study the story of the sick woman in the crowd
who touched the fringe of Jesus' garment: Luke 8:43-48; The Desire
of Ages, pp. 342-348.

   The writer of this lesson testifies: "When life is going great, we
seem to know God has a will for our lives and that we are living in His
will. Then tragedy strikes, and we are puzzled. We are disappointed
and feel betrayed by God. I've been there, have you?
   "Our precious son, Robbie, was born after a very long and difficult
delivery. He weighed almost 10 pounds and was a perfect baby, but he
did not breathe immediately. In that short time span, he suffered
permanent brain damage.
   "We were heartbroken. Over the years, we've seen dozens of spe-
cialists. Some physicians told us he would never walk or talk. Along
with family and friends, we spent years praying for his healing. We
believed, had faith, claimed His promises, and trusted, yet God did not
heal Robbie. However, he has blessed us all so richly.
   "Robbie is now 34 years old with a mental age of 6. He is happy,
somewhat independent, and loves the Lord. Everyone, including phy-
sicians, staff, and the families in his developmental school, asks Robbie
to pray for them because 'Robbie's prayers are answered.' Robbie
says, 'Yes, that's true, but sometimes Jesus says, Wait a while.' He
has just won first place in a Special Olympics race. His optimistic
outlook and loving ways inspire us all. God has blessed, even though
He has not healed Robbie's affliction.
   "The answer is never found in bartering with God. The answer isn't
found in completing a checklist. The answer is found in making a
choice. We can choose to concentrate on the hurt, or we can choose to
concentrate on the Healer. Jesus says, 'Come unto me, all you who are
weary and burdened, and I will give you rest' (Matt. 11:28, NIV). He
offers us His healing touch, many times through the peace He gives in
the midst of tears. If anyone understands suffering, He does!
   "Our family and our friends, and countless others in similar situa-
tions, look forward to heaven, when we will see our dear ones healed
completely by the Master Healer! I am sustained by my faith in that
hope. 'And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes' (Rev.
21:4)."

SUMMARY: Jesus' healing touch can make sick people well. Even
when, for reasons that He alone understands, He does not choose to
heal physically, He gives spiritual strength, the grace to endure, the
patience to wait for His ultimate healing when He comes again.

                      The Miracle Twins
                           Thony Escotto

     Roidel and Roberto are 18-year-old twin brothers who live in
 Havana, Cuba. Muscular dystrophy has left them almost com-
 pletely paralyzed since the age of 7. For most of their youth they
 have been prisoners in their wheelchairs.
     Their mother exposed her sons to the world of the occult as
 she practiced witchcraft and spiritism at home. Without hope for
 a cure, the brothers grew bitter and began to show aggression
 toward their friends.
     One day Melinda Hernandez, an instructor for Tu Historia
 Preferida, the Spanish version of Your Story Hour, a popular
 Seventh-day Adventist radio program, met the brothers. She
 gave them a cassette tape of "Little Bad Legs," the story of
 Glenn Cunningham, whose legs were badly burned in an explo-
 sion that killed his brother. But Cunningham was determined to
 walk. He claimed the promise of Isaiah 40:31: "But those who
 hope in the Lord will renew their strength. . . . They will run and
 not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint" (NIV). Answer-
 ing pain with prayer, he learned to walk, then run. He began
 running races and eventually became a champion runner, and an
 Olympian.
     Roberto and Roidel found hope in the story of Glenn
 Cunningham. They listened to the cassette over and over. They
 wondered whether the God who helped Glenn Cunningham could
 help them to walk again as well. The brothers memorized the
 Bible promise and searched for other words of hope in the Bible.
  Finally they had found something they could believe in.
     A complete transformation began to take place in the broth-
 ers' lives. They began studying the Bible lessons that came with
  the tape; they attended "Your Story Hour" club meetings. And in
  time they began to go to church. In January of 1996, they surren-
  dered their hearts to Christ and were baptized. Those present
  witnessed not only a spiritual transformation but also a physical
  one. After spending 11 years in their wheelchairs, Roberto and
  Roidel took their first steps. Although they cannot run, their trust
  in God has revitalized them physically as well as spiritually.
     The brothers' lives are no longer filled with hatred and anger.
  They now greet their friends with words about the love of Jesus.

  a popular radio program produced by Seventh-day Adventists
  in Berrien Springs, Michigan.

              Healing the Spirit




Sabbath Afternoon

READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Mark 2:1-12; Ps.147:3; Isa. 35:3-6.

   MEMORY TEXT: The Lord "forgives all your iniquity, . . .
   land] heals all your diseases" (Psalm 103:3, RSV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Human beings are created in the image of God
with intimately related physical, mental, social, and spiritual charac-
teristics. The Healer of Israel has the authority to forgive sin, and the
power to heal.

   THE HEALING POWER OF THE GOSPEL. "This world is a
vast lazar house, but Christ came to heal the sick, to proclaim deliver-
ance to the captives of Satan. He was, in Himself, health and strength.
He imparted His life to the sick, the afflicted, those possessed of
demons. He turned away none who came to receive His healing
power. He knew that those who petitioned Him for help had brought
disease upon themselves; yet He did not refuse to heal them. And
when virtue from Christ entered into these poor souls, they were
convicted of sin, and many were healed of their spiritual disease, as
well as of their physical maladies. The gospel still possesses the same
power, and why should we not today witness the same results?
   "Christ feels the woes of every sufferer. When evil spirits rend a
human frame, Christ feels the curse. When fever is burning up the life
current, He feels the agony. And He is just as willing to heal the sick now
as when He was personally on earth. Christ's servants are His representa-
tives, the channels for His working. He desires through them to exercise
His healing power."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 823, 824.

THE PARALYTIC (Mark 2:1-12).

 What was the physical condition of the person brought to Jesus?
Mark 2:3.


    Scripture does not provide a definitive diagnosis, other than to refer
to this person as a "paralytic." We may speculate that he suffered from
a muscle-wasting disease, such as muscular dystrophy, or a neurologi-
cal disorder, such as multiple sclerosis or polio. Whatever the cause,
apparently he was bedridden and unable to move independently. Ellen
White suggests that his condition had been deteriorating for some time
and that he was experiencing the final stages of his disease.

   What do we understand regarding his mental state? "This para-
lytic had lost all hope of recovery. . . . He had long before appealed to
the . . . doctors, hoping for relief from mental suffering and physical
pain. But they coldly pronounced him incurable. . . . The palsied man
was entirely helpless, and, seeing no prospect of aid from any quarter,
he had sunk into despair."—The Desire of Ages, p. 267.


   In what way did this man's religious beliefs affect his illness?
"The Pharisees regarded affliction as an evidence of divine displea-
sure, and they held themselves aloof from the sick and the needy."—
The Desire of Ages, p. 267.
   The paralytic was convinced that his disease was the result of a life
of sin; the burden of guilt and remorse was superimposed upon the
physical pain that accompanied his every waking moment. He was
rejected by his church and felt cut off from God, unforgiven, unloved,
hopeless.

   How did news about the Healer affect him? What was his
primary motive in seeking out the Healer?


   "It was not physical restoration he desired so much as relief from
the burden of sin. If he could see Jesus, and receive the assurance of
forgiveness and peace with Heaven, he would be content to live or die,
according to God's will. The cry of the dying man was, Oh that I
might come into His presence!"—The Desire of Ages, p. 267.

   Are you comfortable visiting someone who is dying? What do
 you say? What do you think the dying person might feel when
 you speak to him or her?

                                                                       31

THE FRIENDS (Mark 2:3-5).

  In what ways did the friends of the paralytic contribute to his
healing? Mark 2:3-5.


Personal presence:
   "When we honestly ask ourselves which persons in our lives mean the
most to us, we often find that it is [they are] those who, instead of giving
much advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain
and touch our wounds with a gentle and tender hand. The friend who can
be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion, who can stay with
us in an hour of grief and bereavement, who can tolerate not-knowing,
not-curing, not-healing and face with us the reality of our powerlessness,
that is the friend who cares."—Henri Nouwen, Out of Solitude (Notre
Dame Campus, hid: Ave Maria, 1974).

Burden-bearing:
   His friends became arms and hands and legs and feet for the
paralytic. They provided strength for his weakness and mobility for
his confinement. In a very practical way, they met his immediate
physical need.

Brought him to Jesus:
  Ellen White indicates that it was his friends who told the paralytic
about Jesus and encouraged him to believe that he might be healed.
When he asked to be carried to the Healer, they gladly responded.

Removal of Barriers:
   "Again and again the bearers of the paralytic tried to push their way
through the crowd, but in vain. The sick man looked about him in utter
anguish. . . . At his suggestion his friends bore him to the top of the
house and, breaking up the roof, let him down at the feet of Jesus."
—The Desire of Ages, p. 268.

Faithfulness:
   Scripture records that when Jesus saw "their faith," he responded
with words of forgiveness and healing. By their presence in his life,
their willingness to carry his load, their initiative in bringing him to
Jesus, their persistence in breaking down barriers, and their expres-
sion of faith, the friends of the paralytic contributed to his healing.

   Do you have a friend in need of healing? If you do, how can
 you become a source of healing for your friend?

THE HEALER (Mark 2:5).

  What were the first words of Jesus to the paralytic? Mark 2:5.
How was this statement received by the "teachers of the law"?
Mark 2:6, 7, NIV.


   "The first thing Jesus does for everyone of us is to say, 'Child, God
is not angry with you. Come home, and don't be afraid."'—William
Barclay, The Gospel of Mark (Philadelphia, Pa.: Westminster Press,
1975), p. 48.
   "The Pharisees caught at these words as blasphemy, and conceived
that they could present this as a sin worthy of death."—The Desire of
Ages, p. 269.

   Why were Jesus' words so offensive to the teachers?


   "The pronouncement was startling because it seemed inappropriate
and even irrelevant to the immediate situation. It is intelligible, however,
against the background provided by the OT where sin and disease,
forgiveness and healing are frequently interrelated concepts. Healing is
conditioned by the forgiveness of God and is often the demonstration of
that forgiveness . . . . Healing is a gracious movement of God into the
sphere of withering and decay which are the tokens of death at work in
man's life. It was not God's intention that man should live with the
pressure of death upon him. Sickness, disease and death are the conse-
quence of the sinful condition of all men. Consequently every healing is
a driving back of death and an invasion of the province of sin . . . . Jesus'
pronouncement of pardon is the recognition that man can be genuinely
whole only when the breach occasioned by sin has been healed through
God's forgiveness of sins."—William L. Lane, "The Gospel of Mark,"
The New International Commentary on the New Testament (Grand
Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1974), p. 94.

   In what way did Jesus magnify the dilemma of belief for the
teachers? Mark 2:9.


    "Apparently the scribes were thinking, 'It is easy to say that a
 man's sins are forgiven, for no one can really tell whether they
 are.' Jesus immediately took up their unspoken challenge and,
 in substance, inquired: 'Which would you find easier, to forgive
 a man's sins or to heal him of paralysis?' The answer was
 obvious."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 581.

                                                                         33

THE HEALING (Mark 2:10-12).

   What is the theological significance of the words chosen by
Jesus to speak healing to the paralytic? Mark 2:10, 11.


   "The usual Greek word for "power," in the sense of "might" or
"strength," is dunamis. To work a miracle required power, but the
forgiveness of sin was a matter of authority. In the present passage,
exousia [authority] stands at the beginning of the clause, and so
emphasizes Christ's authority to forgive sin."—SDA Bible Commen-
tary, vol. 5, p. 581.

   What was the response of the paralytic to Jesus' words? Mark
2:12.


   "Then he who had been borne on a litter to Jesus rises to his feet
with the elasticity and strength of youth. The life-giving blood bounds
through his veins. Every organ of his body springs into sudden activ-
ity. The glow of health succeeds the pallor of approaching death."
—The Desire of Ages, p. 269.

   What is the inescapable conclusion of these events?


   "It required nothing less than creative power to restore health to
that decaying body. The same voice that spoke life to man created
from the dust of the earth had spoken life to the dying paralytic. And
the same power that gave life to the body had renewed the heart. . . .
   "The paralytic found in Christ healing for both the soul and the
body. The spiritual healing was followed by physical restoration. This
lesson should not be overlooked. There are today thousands suffering
from physical disease, who, like the paralytic, are longing for the
message, 'Thy sins are forgiven.' The burden of sin, with its unrest
and unsatisfied desires, is the foundation of their maladies. They can
find no relief until they come to the Healer of the soul."—The Desire
of Ages, pp. 269, 270.

   What was the main purpose of this miracle? Discuss how this
miracle sheds light on the relationship between healing and
forgiveness. What does this relationship suggest regarding the
relevance of Christian faith for the sick? Which is more impor-

HEALERS TODAY.

   Every day around the world, people come to Adventist hospitals
and clinics seeking healing. They have a myriad of illnesses, injuries,
and hurts, including heart disease, cancer, mental illness, AIDS, liver
failure, and broken bones.

   What is the ultimate cause of all illness? Rom. 5:12.


   The truth of the human condition is that all have sinned and all are
subject to disease and death. Unwise lifestyle choices increase the risk
of experiencing a variety of diseases; it is also true that healthful
choices provide no guarantee against the assault of disease.

  How should Christian healers relate to people whose disease
appears to be the result of an unwise or sinful lifestyle? Rom. 5:17.


   Every person suffering from illness, regardless of its apparent or
supposed cause, is beloved of God. Every sick or dying one offers an
opportunity for Christian healers to communicate hope, grace, and
peace.
   "This hope can take many forms. One can offer the patient the hope
that his disease will not follow the usual course . . . [or] the hope that
people are concerned for the patient's comfort and enough resources
are available to minimize pain and suffering. . . . Spiritual hope can
sustain the dying when no reasonable physical hope remains . . . a
strong sense of life's purpose and ultimate reward can carry one
through the worst stages of an illness."—Kenneth H. Fishbeck, M.D.,
Journal of Christian Healing, vol. 7, no. 1, p. 9.

    The Healer's Gift. "I needed a friend.... Someone who was willing
 to be stretched to the limit of love, of trust, of yielding to God's
 promptings. Someone willing to stretch out his arms like Jesus on
 the Cross to embrace the whole of me: my hurts, fears, 'ugliness,'
 sinfulness . . . to see the blossom in the yet-uncracked seed, to see
 the wholeness where only brokenness showed, to see Jesus' hand
 reaching out from me for a companion to walk with. . . . I needed a
 friend, and Jesus gave me YOU."—Maryanne Marx, Journal of
 Christian Healing, vol. 7, no. 1, p. 10.




                                                                      35

FURTHER STUDY: Read The Desire of Ages, pp. 267-271.

   There are at least five distinct individuals or groups represented in
the account we have considered: the paralytic, his friends, the crowd,
the Healer, and the critics.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Where do you see yourself in this picture? If the story were
     made into a motion picture, what role would best fit you?

   2. It took several friends to carry the paralytic's pallet. Are
      you comfortable working with others in loving people and
      in helping them come to Christ? Why, or why not?

   3. What is your area of giftedness in healing?

   4. Would you characterize your church as a healing commu-
      nity? Why, or why not?

   There are positive physiological consequences to love, hope, joy,
and mental peace. Negative physical consequences result from de-
pression and despair.
   "The paralytic found in Christ healing for both the soul and the
body. He needed health of soul before he could appreciate health of
body. Before the physical malady could be healed, Christ must bring
relief to the mind, and cleanse the soul from sin. This lesson should
not be overlooked. There are today thousands suffering from physical
disease who, like the paralytic, are longing for the message, 'Thy sins
are forgiven.' The burden of sin, with its unrest and unsatisfied de-
sires, is the foundation of their maladies. They can find no relief until
they come to the Healer of the soul. The peace which He alone can
impart would restore vigor to the mind and health to the body."—The
Ministry of Healing, p. 77.

SUMMARY: Jesus healed the paralytic as a demonstration of His
power to heal physically, as well as His authority to forgive sins.
Because he was forgiven, the sick man was enabled to accept the
blessing of healing. Our role is to cooperate with Jesus in bringing
spiritual healing to those who may or may not be restored to physical
health.

                        Unexpected Gift
                            David Ferraro

    Recently four precious people were baptized in the little Adventist
church in Niamey, Niger. Following the baptism, Ali, a church mem-
ber, shared this story:
    He and his family had fled the country of Mali as refugees. They
had traveled to several countries looking for work and a safe place to
live. Then Ali heard of an organization called ADRA, in Niger. He
contacted ADRA, hoping that someone could help him. He met the
local pastor, who listened to Ali's story and offered him hope. When
Ali revealed that he was searching for answers to spiritual questions,
the pastor gave him some material to read. Ali accepted the material
and later began studying a Bible correspondence course. As he stud-
ied, he found answers to many of his questions.
    Ali wanted to tell his wife, Adama, about his new discoveries, but
was not sure how. She was a faithful Muslim. Finally he decided to
invite her to church on Sabbath morning. When they arrived at church,
Adama was shocked. "How could you do this?" she demanded. "This
is terrible! You have brought me to a Christian church!" Adama went
home, packed her belongings, and returned to her village.
    Ali was confused. What had he done? A few days later Ali was
summoned to appear before the marabous (Koran teachers) to answer
his wife's charges. They tried to convince him to give up his interest in
Christianity. "What you did was very serious," they told him. "With
Christians we do not even eat!"
    Ali told them simply, "One day the Lord will judge me and my
choices. And my wife alone must decide whether to return to me and
our children or to give up the family forever."
    Adama returned home to her family, but was not interested in
Christianity. Ali was becoming discouraged. His problem seemed too
big to handle; he was ready to give up Christianity.
    On Christmas morning Adama asked her husband, "What gift do
 you have for me?" Noting the look of surprise on his face, she
 continued, "I know that Christians give gifts on Christmas." But Ali
 had no gifts to give that day. "Never mind," Adama answered. "I have
 a gift for you. I will come to church with you."
    Ali was thrilled when his wife joined him for church. Later she
 began Bible studies. And on that Sabbath day Adama was baptized.
 For Ali it was the best gift!

Union of West Africa.

              The Act of Faith




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Mark 5:21-43; 9:14-29; Matt.
8:5-13; John 5:1-8, 14.

  MEMORY TEXT: Now faith is being sure of what we hope for
  and certain of what we do not see. . . . And without faith it is
  impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him
  must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who
  earnestly seek him (Hebrews 11:1, 6, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Faith is practiced, it acts, and results follow.

   FAITH DEFINED. Faith has been defined as unquestioning be-
lief, complete trust, confidence, loyalty, expectation. Faith is being
certain of our hopes even when we cannot visualize their fulfillment.
   This week we will investigate faith and the act of faith with regard
to healing. On several occasions, Jesus made statements to this effect,
"Your faith has made you well." It seems to imply that the intensity of
belief or certainty made it so. Is that what Jesus meant?
   How much faith must I have to be healed? If my faith is lacking,
can God still heal me? How much is our part, and how much is God's?
Would a loving God not heal me just because I wasn't certain enough?
   Let us see how Jesus' ministry supplies some answers for us as we
investigate the act of faith this week.

THE ACT OF FAITH FROM A DISTANCE (Matt. 8:5-13).

   "The Centurion was the backbone of the Roman military. This
officer was responsible for leadership, discipline, and the morale of
100 soldiers. But this was a soldier who cared. The gentleness of the
man is evidenced by his request. His concern, appeal, and the expres-
sion of faith isn't for himself but for a slave who is 'paralyzed and in
terrible suffering.' While this may seem a normal humane act, it
wasn't common in Roman society. Masters had absolute control, life
and death, over their slaves who were considered no different from a
useful tool. This centurion was a man who cared for other men."
—William Barclay, The Gospel of Matthew (Philadelphia, Pa.:
Westminster, 1975), p. 302.

  How did the centurion demonstrate his faith? Matt. 8:8, 9;
Luke 7:7, 8.

    Jesus was willing to break the cultural taboos and enter the home of
a Gentile, but the centurion's faith made that unnecessary. In Matthew
8:10-12, Jesus taught that the only passport into His kingdom is faith.
While the Jewish leaders would have been appalled to see Jesus enter
a Gentile home, here was a Gentile whose act of faith was greater than
all that Jesus had witnessed in Israel.

   What Bible truth does the centurion's attitude teach us about
faith, privilege, and prejudice? Acts 10:34, 35; Luke 12:48.


   "The centurion said of himself, 'I am not worthy.' His heart had
been touched by the grace of Christ. He saw his own unworthiness; yet
he feared not to ask help. He trusted not to his own goodness; his
argument was his great need. His faith took hold upon Christ in His
true character. He did not believe in Him merely as a worker of
miracles, but as the friend and Saviour of mankind. . . . We have
nothing to recommend us to God; but the plea that we may urge now
and ever is our utterly helpless condition that makes His redeeming
power a necessity. Renouncing all self-dependence, we may look to
the cross of Calvary and say—
         `In my hand no price I bring;
         Simply to Thy cross I cling.' "—The Desire of Ages, p. 317.

   When you extend your faith and ask for God to heal, what do
 you expect Him to do?



                                                                     39

THE ACT OF FAITH INTERRUPTED (Mark 5:21-36).

   Jairus was a synagogue ruler; today we might call him the "head
elder." He was over the administration of the local synagogue—both
the physical plant and the schedule of services—and probably one of
the most respected leaders in his town. His faith reached out to Jesus
for help; nothing else held any hope; his 12-year-old daughter was
dying. It must have been a humbling act of faith. Normally Jairus
would not put faith in an unrecognized itinerant like Jesus.

   What emotions do you think Jairus experienced

   1. when he left his daughter to look for Jesus,


   2. when he fell at Jesus' feet, and


   3. when Jesus agreed to go with him?


    When our expectations are blocked, it is often a source of anger,
frustration, and disappointment. We expect God to protect us from
life's major calamities. When that expectation is not realized, our faith
often sags, and we question the mercy of God.
    Jairus anxiously tried to move Jesus and the accompanying crowd
to his home. He was acting on his faith, but then his expectations were
blocked. Jesus stopped, the whole crowd stopped with him, and Jesus
asked the unusual question, "Who touched me?"

   How do you think Jairus felt about Jesus' question? What was
the response of the disciples? Mark 5:30, 31; Luke 8:45-47.


   The woman got her miracle, but Jairus's hopes were dashed. A
messenger arrived with the news that his daughter was dead. When the
dream is dead, when you have extended your faith and your world still
crashes down, why bother the Teacher any further? The girl was dead.
Jesus sought to reinspire hope by saying, "Don't be afraid; just be-
lieve" (Mark 5:36, NIV). The joy of his life, his little girl, was dead.
But Jesus' words offered a ray of hope.

     How do you have hope, and practice faith, when it seems all hope is
 gone? What problems are you facing right now that seem bigger than
 life? Is your God bigger than your problem? (See Matthew 19:26.)

Tuesday                                              October 28
THE ACT OF FAITH—JESUS' CONFIDENCE (Mark 5:35-43;
Matt. 9:23-26; Luke 8:50-56).

  How are we to ask God for what we need? James 1:5-8.


   Jesus' instruction to Jairus "Don't be afraid; just believe" was a
statement of His own confidence in His Father. It was an encourage-
ment for Jairus not to give up hope, a call to endure even in this
moment, and to cling to belief. Sensitive to the family's needs, Jesus
dismissed the crowd and nine of His disciples. Only Peter, James, and
John traveled with Him to Jairus' home.

   What scene did they encounter at this home? Mark 5:38.


   Professional mourners were wailing. The soulful sounds of the
mourner's flute were being played. Neighbors had gathered. "The
mourners hung over the dead body, begging for a response from the
silent lips. They beat their breasts; they tore their hair; and they rent
their garments. . . . This made a Jewish house a poignant and pathetic
place on the day of mourning."—Barclay, The Gospel of Mark, p.
134. And Jesus said to them, "Why all this commotion and wailing?
The child is not dead but asleep" (Mark 5:39, NIV). They laughed.
They knew she was dead.

  Why do you think Jesus refers to death as sleep? Matt. 9:24;
John 11:11, 25, 26.


   Jesus sent everyone out of the house except the girl's parents and
His three disciples. Faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain
of what we don't yet see, and Jesus acted in faith. No prayer is
recorded. Jesus' union with His Father was so close that He had
complete assurance that He could raise the dead girl to life. As the
source of all life, He could call one back from the jaws of death.

   What was Jesus' command and the little girl's response? Mark
5:41, 42. What keeps us from exercising that kind of faith? Ps.
66:18; John 12:26; 14:13, 14 (compare 1 John 5:14).


    Why did Jesus want the story kept secret? Can public rela-
 tions sometimes hinder God's work? Can it block God's contin-
 ued efforts on our behalf? Matt. 6:3-6.

                                                                     41
Wednesday                                               October 29
THE ACT OF FAITH IN A TOUCH (Mark 5:24-34; Luke
8:43-48).

   For twelve years the sick woman had motivation to pray. Sickness
had plagued her. She had fluctuated between despair and hope. She
would go to a doctor or herbalist or healer and find herself no better off.
   She had no insurance plan or government assistance program, and
now she was bankrupt. Not just financially bankrupt, but her emo-
tions, her body, her relationships were bankrupt. Her disease not only
debilitated her physically, but her condition made her "unclean" ac-
cording to the law in Leviticus 15:25-27. This isolated her from her
church, social circles, her husband, and children.

  What do you do when you've prayed and acted in faith for
twelve years and nothing is better? Rom. 8:26-28, 35-39; Luke
22:42. What are the risks of being more infatuated with being
healed than in love with the Healer?


   Her cycle of hope and failure may have initially discouraged her
from seeking Jesus, but finally she determined to cross paths with
Him. She believed that if she just touched His clothes she would be
healed. And when she touched His coat, she was immediately healed.
Undoubtedly, she would have liked to slip away anonymously to
enjoy her newfound health, but faith's results aren't only for the
recipient. When she came forward, Jesus declared, "Your faith has
healed you" (Mark 5:34, NIV).

   Why were the little girl's parents asked to keep the miracle
secret (Mark 5:43), while Jesus insisted on making public the sick
woman's healing? (verses 30-34).


   "After healing the woman, Jesus desired her to acknowledge the
blessing she had received. The gifts which the gospel offers are not to
be secured by stealth or enjoyed in secret. So the Lord calls upon us
for confession of His goodness. 'Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord,
that I am God.' Isa. 43:12."—The Desire of Ages, p. 347.
   On other occasions Jesus asked persons he had healed not to make the
miracle known (Mark 1:43, 44; Matt. 9:30). Too much publicity could
have hindered His ministry by awakening a popular movement in His
favor and by arousing the deep enmity of the nation's religious leaders.

    What benefits for yourself and for others is your testimony to
 the healing power of Christ, both spiritually and physically?

THE ACT OF FAITH (Mark 9:14-29; Matt. 17:14-21).

   While Jesus, Peter, James, and John were witnessing Jesus' trans-
figuration, a man brought his boy to be healed by Jesus' disciples. His
journey there and presentation of his son for healing were acts of faith.
The disciples had been given power to "drive out all demons and to
cure diseases" (Luke 9:1, NIV), but now they appeared helpless. The
father's faith had been shaken. After explaining his predicament to
Jesus, he begged, "But if you can do anything, take pity on us and help
us" (Mark 9:22, NIV).

   Why did the healing of the son depend on the faith of the
father? Mark 9:23, 24. How may our self-reliance and lack of
belief block what God wants to do for us?


   When the father recognized his own weakness, he could extend his
faith and ask for help toward greater faith. Jesus knew that there is an
incredible link between the mind and body. In this story, there is a link
between one person's faith and someone else's body. While we don't
fully understand it, the link is undeniable.
   In a clinical trial of a new form of chemotherapy for cancer pa-
tients, some patients were given sterile salt water. Even though salt
water does not cause hair loss, 30 percent of this group lost their hair!
They expected chemotherapy to produce hair loss, and their bodies
responded to the expectation.
    While belief is important and the mind can significantly influence
the body, acts of faith aren't simply self-help, a "conjure-up-enough-
belief-and-be-well" technique. It is faith in a God who can heal.

   Right now, do you need to practice faith? What is keeping you
from your act of faith?


   The only problem too big for God is one we won't give Him!
 Here are some steps to help you act in faith:
   1. Accept that God is able. "With God all things are possible"
      (Matt. 19:26).
   2. Accept God's wisdom to face your problem (James 1:5).
   3. Accept counsel from Christian friends (Prov. 11:14).
   4. Act. Believing God is able, accepting His wisdom, and good
      counsel, choose a course of action and ACT in faith (Heb.
      11:8).

                                                                      43
Friday                                                   October 31
FURTHER STUDY: What does Jesus' healing the man at the pool of
Bethesda teach us about faith in relation to spiritual healing? John 5:
1-8, 14.

   "Through the same faith we may receive spiritual healing. . . . Of
ourselves we are no more capable of living a holy life than was the
impotent man capable of walking. There are many who realize their
helplessness, and who long for that spiritual life which will bring them
into harmony with God; they are vainly striving to obtain it. In despair
they cry, '0 wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from this
body of death?' Rom. 7:24, margin. Let these desponding, struggling
ones look up. The Saviour is bending over the purchase of His blood,
saying with inexpressible tenderness and pity, 'Wilt thou be made
whole?' He bids you arise in health and peace. Do not wait to feel that
you are made whole. Believe His word, and it will be fulfilled. Put
your will on the side of Christ. Will to serve Him, and in acting upon
His word you will receive strength. Whatever may be the evil practice,
the master passion which through long indulgence binds both soul and
body, Christ is able and longs to deliver. He will impart life to the soul
that is 'dead in trespasses.' Eph. 2:1. He will set free the captive that is
held by weakness and misfortune and the chains of sin."—The Desire
of Ages, p. 203.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What is your responsibility to the sick and suffering in your
     community? In what ways is a separation of body healing
     and spiritual healing an unreal separation?

   2. How do we fulfill the "act of faith" in a healing ministry
      today? What is the proper relation between faith and health
      science? Is there any act of faith in using modern medicine?
      (See The Ministry of Healing, pp. 230-233.)

   3. How can you act in faith for the benefit of your world?
      For whom will you act in faith, be it physically, socially, or
      spiritually?

SUMMARY: Faith is God's gift to those who seek it. Faith is also our
choice to act according to Christ's will. We must exercise the gift that
God bestows. Spiritual healing always results; physical healing results
for us or others when God sees that it is for our or their best good.

                                 Charlotte Ishkanian

            Konde Sered [Seh-RED] grew up during wartime in Uganda. He
        lived in a large family near the shore of Lake Victoria. When he was
        13 years old, his father left and married another woman. His mother
        could not afford to keep all the children, so Konde went to live with
        his older sister while he attended school. But at age 15 he fell sick and
        had to leave school. Sadly, Konde returned to his home village.
                                                                                    n
            Because of the war, soldiers often raided villages looking for
        able-bodied men to fight. When word came that the soldiers were on


                                                                                    i
        their way, Konde's uncle fled into the bush to avoid being taken.
        Konde helped hide his uncle's possessions in the bush, where they
        would be safe from the soldiers.
            Among his uncle's things, Konde found a book titled The
        Great Controversy. The title intrigued him, and he took the book
        home to read. As he read, he found a chapter on the Sabbath.
        Konde showed the chapter to his older brother, who became
        interested too. The brothers were surprised that so many verses in
        the Bible mentioned the Sabbath, yet they had never heard of it.
        They decided to ask their father about it, for he was an important
        leader in his church. But their father was not interested in the book
        or its teaching on the Sabbath. The boys were disappointed, but
        they continued reading The Great Controversy and comparing it
        with texts in their Bible.
             Konde's brother heard about some Christians who worshiped
        on Saturday. He went to town to ask whether they knew the book
        the boys were reading. He returned with an excited "They are the
        ones!"
             The brothers attended the Adventist church and found it differ-
         ent from their family's church. In their church, the priests read
         printed prayers and did not give detailed sermons. But the Adven-
         tist pastor preached carefully prepared sermons and prayed spon-
                                    taneous prayers!
                                       Konde and his brother were convinced
                                    that the Adventist Church was God's true
                                    church. They decided to be baptized. But
                                    when their father learned of their plans, he
                                    was angry and threatened to disown them.

               Modern Demons




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 4:24, 25; 17:14-21;
Mark 5:1-17; Luke 4:33-37.

   MEMORY TEXT: "Casting all your care upon Him, for He
   cares for you. Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the
   devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may
   devour" (1 Peter 5:7, 8, NKJV).

    KEY THOUGHT: Whether we damage ourselves, are abused by
others, or are attacked by Satan, we must learn how our thoughts and
attitudes affect us spiritually and mentally.

   SATAN IS A SUBTLE DECEIVER (1 Peter 5:8). He adapts his
methods in order to be most effective in the intellectual, philosophi-
cal, and political climates of the times. To guard against him, we must
avoid three errors.
   The first is to spiritualize all our problems, thus neglecting the
physical, emotional, and mental causes that may disrupt our ability to
think and act clearly. The belief here is that prayer and faith will solve
every problem, no matter what its cause.
   The second is captured in the phrase "The devil made me do it."
This attitude creates a mind-set of victimization and powerlessness to
overcome, rather than our accepting responsibility and making the
effort to change.
   The third is to define reality only by scientifically proven facts,
ignoring or denying the spiritual realm. Thus we limit our mental health
interventions to biological or psychological causes, forgetting the larger
picture of the great controversy and Satan's desire to control our minds.

CASTING OUT DEMONS (Luke 4:33-37).

   Often Jesus cast out demons from possessed individuals. He was
clearly at war with the powers of darkness. His ministry focused on
beating back the evil forces in order that we might gain victory over sin.

   Take time to read each account listed below, taking note of both the
distinctive features of demon possession and Jesus' interventions.

   Luke 4:33-37

   Mark 5:1-17

   Luke 11:14-26

   Mark 7:25-30

   Matt. 17:14-21


   While specific signs of demonic possession vary from story to
story, there are several telltale signs that point toward demonic influ-
ence. These signs are:

         • supernatural knowledge
         • supernatural strength
         • use of altered voices
         • bizarre, often violent behavior
         • presence of a different personality

    The Bible does not give specific instructions for how to exorcize
demons. What scripture teaches us is how to stop our sinful ways and be
filled with Christ's Spirit. This is the sure way to have demons cast out of
our lives. When God's Spirit is in charge of a human mind, demons are
excluded (Romans 8). Jesus wanted His followers to accept the indwell-
ing Spirit as the source of spiritual power (John 14-16).

  What circumstances could make it more than likely for demon
possession to take place?


    On what basis do some Christians avoid studying this topic,
 for fear it might open the door to the devil's influence?

                                                                        47

DEMON POSSESSION (Matt. 17:20).

   When the disciples were unable to cast out the demons possess-
ing a young boy, what was lacking? Matt. 17:20.


  "It is faith that connects us with heaven, and brings us strength for
coping with the powers of darkness. In Christ, God has provided
means for subduing every sinful trait, and resisting every temptation,
however strong."—The Desire of Ages, p. 429.

   Does demon possession occur through personal choice, as a
natural consequence of sinful behavior, or because of a curse or
influence of another person?


   "Giving way willfully to practice sins of the flesh gives occasion
for Satan to have his way in a believer's life. Although the legal claim
of Satan against us was canceled at the cross, a believer's willful
indulgence in fleshly sins gives the enemy a place or a claim against
us which he will be quick to exploit."—Mark I. Bubeck, The Adver-
sary (Chicago, Ill.: Moody, 1975), p. 34.

   Is it possible for Satan to "possess" us in a less dramatic fash-
ion? Luke 22:31-34.


    The lesson author testifies: "I was called to assist an individual by
`casting out' the demons from her life. A psychiatrist believed his
patient was possessed, or overly influenced by her belief in the devil.
She had been abused as a child and had spent her adult life participat-
ing in witchcraft. She heard voices and practiced self-
mutilation. While these are clear psychiatric symptoms, the over-
whelming sense of defeat and control she experienced at the hands of
the devil resulted in continued emotional and behavioral disturbances.
This, despite the application of appropriate medical treatment.
   "When I first met with this young woman, I listened to her story and
heard her deep fears of possession. My heart went out to her. I inquired
about her desire to be healed. As she began to cry uncontrollably, I
asked whether she would like me to pray for her so she could begin
to fmd release from her turmoil. I continued to pray with her over the
next two weeks of hospitalization. During that time, she began to experi-
ence hope and deliverance from the forces gripping her."

      Was this "casting out demons" or "supportive care"?

IS MENTAL ILLNESS THE SAME AS DEMON POSSESSION?

    There is a huge painting in the front of the chapel at the old Worces-
ter, Massachusetts, State Mental Hospital. It was painted by one of their
former mental-health patients. In it, the demoniac is released from the
chains that have bound him for so long. Was the painter depicting release
from mental illness or from demon possession?
    There are those today who would say there is no such thing as
demon possession. They insist that what was described in the Bible as
demon possession is better understood as mental illness.
    It is easy to understand this confusion, because many of the charac-
teristics appear to be the same for both: bizarre behavior, confused
thoughts, and lack of control.
    The following list of differences may prove helpful in distinguish-
ing mental illness from demon possession:

   • Demons want nothing to do with Jesus. Mentally ill patients
     are often very religious.
   • Demons are portrayed with distinctive personalities that in-
     habit the body. Mental illness does not manifest such differ-
     entiated personalities.
   • Demons speak in a rational manner and with insights that
     would not be possible for the possessed individual to know.
     Mentally ill patients usually do not speak in rational, logical
     ways.
   • The cure from demon possession is instantaneous. Mental
     illness takes much longer to cure or control.

   While scientific discoveries have made major advances in the under-
standing and treatment of mental illness, they have not provided all the
answers.
   "The true principles of psychology are found in the Holy Scrip-
tures. . . . He who comes to Jesus, he who believes on Him and makes
Him his Example, realizes the meaning of the words 'To them gave
He power to become the sons of God.'
   "The advantage he [Satan] takes of the sciences, sciences which
pertain to the human mind, is tremendous. Here, serpentlike, he im-
perceptibly creeps in to corrupt the work of God."—Mind, Character,
and Personality, vol. 1, pp. 10,19.

    Why does demon possession seem to be common only in some
 primitive cultures? Do you think a diagnosis of mental illness or a
 diagnosis of demon possession is a better explanation of disturbed
 people today? Why? Are good Christians immune to mental illness?

                                                                      49

INSTRUCTIONS FOR IMPROVED MENTAL HEALTH (John
8:32).

   "You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free" (John
8:32, RSV).
   Satan is the author of lies. It is his deceptions that are at the heart of
our emotional disturbances. When we believe his lies, our understand-
ing of reality is distorted.
   "Some of the lies we tell ourselves we know to be lies. But . . .
some we believe have actually become the 'truth' because we have
practiced them for so long. These are the most dangerous lies of all
because we rarely, if ever, dispute them. We don't dispute what we
believe to be true."—Chris Thurman, The Truths We Must Believe
(Nashville, Tenn.: Nelson Comm., 1992), p. 24.
   What are some of the more destructive lies we may come to believe?
   • I must have everyone's approval all the time.
   • My unhappiness is somebody else's fault.
   • I am only as good as what I do.
   • If our marriage takes such hard work, we must not be right for
     each other.
   • Depression, anger, and anxiety are indicators of weak faith.

   What is the source of the lies we choose to believe? John 8:44.

   "Nothing is so easy as to deceive one's self; for what we wish, we
readily believe."—Demosthenes.
   Satan's deceptions create profound mental disturbances. To be
effective in our interventions, we must not only address the symp-
toms, but understand the root causes.
   "The emotional complaints of our time, complaints we therapists
hear every day in our practice, include emptiness, meaninglessness,
vague depression, disillusionment about marriage, family, and rela-
tionship, loss of values, yearning for personal fulfillment, a hunger for
spirituality."—Thomas Moore, Care of the Soul (New York, N.Y.:
Harper Collins, 1992), p. xvi.

   If medications and insight alone cannot effectively resolve these
issues, what is an effective remedy? John 8:32, 34-36; Phil. 4:8.

 What can you do to help a discouraged church member or neighbor?

MENTAL HEALTH AND IMPROVED PHYSICAL HEALTH
(Prov. 17:22).

   What indications do we have in God's Word regarding the rela-
tionship between mental health and physical health? Prov. 3:5-8.


    This truth is also demonstrated by modern science.
    "The relation that exists between the mind and the body is very
intimate. When one is affected, the other sympathizes. The condition
of the mind affects the health to a far greater degree than many realize.
Many of the diseases from which men suffer are the result of mental
depression. Grief, anxiety, discontent, remorse, guilt, distrust, all tend
to break down the life forces and to invite decay and death."—The
Ministry of Healing, p. 241.
    Jesus did not make a sharp distinction between mental health and
physical health. He used the same healing principles in both cases
(Matt. 4:23, 24).
    "The mechanisms by which personal beliefs, psychosocial factors,
and stress affect the development of disease are not as well understood.
What we do know, however, is that the mind and body communicate
constantly with each other. What the mind thinks, perceives, and experi-
ences is transmitted from our brain to the rest of our bodies. . . . It is
possible for thoughts (I can't stand this! How dare that car cut me off!)
and emotions (anger, frustration) to be associated with physical changes
(increased blood pressure, increased muscle tension) that can be poten-
tially harmful."—Herbert Benson, The Wellness Book, p. 13.
    There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating the positive
relationship between religion and health. Those who attend church
regularly live longer, have fewer diseases, and are less likely to have
 mental-health problems. A study completed by Loma Linda Univer-
sity indicates that Seventh-day Adventist men live 6.2 years longer,
 and Adventist women live 3.7 years longer than the American norm.
 The cancer rate for American Adventists is only 60 percent of the
 national norm and coronary heart disease is 66 percent. This evidence
 is consistent with the benefits of the lifestyle described in the Bible.

    Church attendance is associated with lower blood pressure,
 less substance abuse, and, in senior citizens, with an increased
 desire to live, according to Elisabeth McSherry in a conference
 on "Spirituality and Health Care Outcomes" (National Insti-
 tutes of Health, March 21, 22, 1995), p. 3.

FURTHER STUDY: Note how Jesus instructed us to help others:
Matthew 10:7, 8.

   Helping those in trouble is our witness for Christ. Satan is con-
stantly seeking to defeat us. We need to be armed with the armor of
God and through supportive concern for each other to defeat him and
his desire to control our lives.
   "Those wretched beings [the demoniacs of Gergesa], dwelling in
the place of graves, possessed by demons, in bondage to uncontrolled
passions and loathsome lusts, represent what humanity would become
if given up to satanic jurisdiction. Satan's influence is constantly
exerted upon men to distract the senses, control the mind for evil, and
incite to violence and crime. He weakens the body, darkens the intel-
lect, and debases the soul. Whenever men reject the Saviour's invita-
tion, they are yielding themselves to Satan."—The Desire of Ages, p.
341.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. When others come to you with their troubles, what is the
     best way to help? From the following list of answers, discuss
     what approaches are most likely to achieve success and
     why. Identify the strengths and limitations of each response.
     Make this as practical as you can in your ministry to others:

      a. Listen to their concerns; then help define more clearly what
         you heard.
      b. Give answers that you have found to be helpful.
      c. Refer to someone else for help.
      d. Offer a prayer and read a supportive text of Scripture.

   2. What practical approaches can you take to defeat Satan's
      attacks on your minds?

   3. What can you do to make people feel more comfortable
      coming to you with their problems? Some people are sought-
      after counselors. Why?

SUMMARY: Jesus' ministry involved healing mental illness as well
as physical and spiritual illness. Often He released possessed people
of the demons who were harassing them. He enabled the spiritually
and mentally ill to detect the lies of the evil one and, by God's grace,
to accept forgiveness and to live in accordance with divine principles.

                           The Hidden Book, Part 2
         51R7                    Charlotte Ishkanian

            Konde Sered was helping his family hide his uncle's belong-
         ings from soldiers during the war in Uganda. He discovered a
         book hidden among his uncle's belongings. The title intrigued
         him: The Great Controversy. He took the book home and began
         reading about Bible truths and the world's last days. Konde told
         his brother about the book, and the two began reading it together.
         They compared it with the Bible and found it to be true. They
         learned that the Sabbath of the Bible was Saturday. They found
         the Adventist church and eventually were baptized. Although
         their father was angry with them, they were now young men, and
         he could not punish them.
            Konde shared his new faith with his sister, and she, too,
         accepted the Adventist message and was baptized. Then two of
         their father's younger children came to live with Konde's sister
         while they attended school in town. Konde and his sister took
         them to Sabbath School and church. When they returned to their
         father's home, they were Adventists.
            Now their father was really angry! But the children stood firm
         and told their father that if they could not serve God at home,
         then they would go away and live elsewhere. Their father forbade
         them to attend church on Sabbath and gave them extra work to
         keep them too busy to attend church. The next school year he
         sent the two children to separate schools and arranged for the boy
         to live with other family members. He hoped that this would
         cause the two young people to forget their faith in the Sabbath.
         The boy quit attending church, but his sister, who lives with
          Konde, has remained firm in her beliefs and continues attending
          church.
             One day a friend stopped Konde in town and said, "I heard that
          your father is going to become an Adventist!" Konde was shocked!
                                   He went to his father and asked him about it.
                                    Imagine his joy when he learned that both
                                    his father and his father's wife would soon
                                    be baptized. What rejoicing Konde has seen
                                    in his family, all because he found a book
                                    called The Great Controversy while hiding
                                     his uncle's possessions!

                                   Konde Sered attends school at Bugema
                                   Secondary School. Charlotte Ishkanian

Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 12:8-14; Mark 1:21-
27; Luke 13:10-17; 14:1-6.

  MEMORY TEXT: "Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all
  things and be in health, just as your soul prospers" (3 John 2,
  NKJV).

  KEY THOUGHT: The Sabbath contributes to our spiritual and
physical health and enriches our family and church relationships.

   THE SABBATH MEMORIALIZES DIVINE HEALING. In 1995,
Florida Hospital was selected by the Disney Development Corpora-
tion to provide health-care services in their new city, Celebration,
adjacent to Disney World in Orlando. The city is to be a model healthy
community. During a planning session on the health facility, one of
the architects asked, "Do Adventists have a biblical philosophy of
health we could use in planning this facility?" We concluded that our
health principles are embedded in the environment of Eden.
   The result was a report titled, "A Theme for Celebration Health," in
which Dr. Ted Hamilton wrote: "Created in the image of their Maker,
men and women were designed for work and rest, fellowship and wor-
ship. Adventists believe that optimum health is achieved today through
celebration of these same fundamental life principles." The new Florida
Hospital at Celebration City has as its theme: "The God who has the
power to create all things also has the power and the desire to re-create,
to heal, and to keep us well so that we may have abundant life."
   The purpose of the Sabbath is to honor our Creator-Redeemer God,
who provides spiritual and physical healing.

CEASING FROM WORK (Gen. 2:1-3).

   In the biblical account of the institution of the Sabbath, three
elements are included in the description. What is the first element?
Gen. 2:1, 2 (first part).


    At the end of Creation week, God gave us a perfect example to
follow. And throughout history, the Sabbath has been God's gift for
our spiritual enrichment. But there are blessings beyond the spiritual
that come to those who cease work as the sun sets on Friday afternoon.
Ceasing from work is an essential ingredient of good health.
    Richard Exley suggests a reason: "In our culture, work has become a
god. It is the pre-eminent factor in organizing human life and establish-
ing personal identities. It so dominates people's lives that there is little
time for themselves or their families. The Sabbath is God's answer. It
serves as a counterbalance, establishing the inalienable human right to
rest. It is designed to protect us from the dangers of physical exhaustion,
psychological stress and the interpersonal alienation which result from
idolization and over-identification with work."—Richard Exley, The
Rhythm of Life (Tulsa, Okla.: Honor Books, 1987), p. 73.
    The desire for more material comforts forces people to work exces-
sively, which often results in sleep deficit, and too many people "are
getting between 60 and 90 minutes less per night than they should for
optimum health and performance."—Exley, p. 11. While not all cul-
tures have yet gone this far in pursuit of material goods, the trend on
all continents is clear.
    The lack of rest especially impacts working mothers as they live lives
of perpetual motion. According to one author, sleep-deprived mothers
talk about sleep the way a hungry person talks about food! A Boston,
Massachusetts study found that employed mothers average more than
 eighty hours of housework, child care, and employment per week.
    For those in school, those at work, those rearing children, those in
 the military, those in retirement, those who are sick, and those who are
 well, our humanity links us all with a common need—the weekly
 Sabbath of rest to enrich our lives in every dimension.

   If you live in a community that emphasizes the work ethic above
the rest ethic, what principles does David offer? Ps. 127:1, 2.


   Ask yourself: To what degree is my life driven by the desire for
 material comforts? What steps can I take to prevent my family
 and myself from becoming victims of a cycle of "work and spend"?


                                                                        57
Monday                                              November 10
ELUSIVE REST (Josh. 1:13; Ps. 46:10).

  What is the second element that describes the first Sabbath?
Gen. 2:2 (second part).


   The first two elements noted in Genesis 2 should be two sides of
one coin. But that is not necessarily the way we experience it. You can
go home from work but take the workplace with you and fail to enter
into rest. The Sabbath is God's invitation both to quit work and to
enter into rest.
   Note how Hebrews 4:1-9 details the tragedy of Old Testament
people who knew the gift of the Sabbath and the God of the Sabbath,
but missed the goal of the Sabbath by failing to enter into His rest.
   Without rest there can be fear. The first result of sin in the hearts of
Adam and Eve was fear. They hid from God. And fear continues to
affect health negatively.
   Stress is another recognized factor associated with physical and
mental disorders. In 1993, in a symposium of health futurists from
around the world, participants predicted the diseases of the next de-
cade. They asserted that there would be a great increase in diseases of
the immune system and behavioral-related diseases because of in-
creased fear and the fracturing of families. How reminiscent of the
Bible's description of the end times!

 Describe the effect on health of living in a fear-filled world.
What was Jesus' counsel to believers? Luke 21:25, 26, 34.


  Read Matthew 11:28, 29, and describe the ways in which your
Sabbath keeping has involved Jesus' gift of rest.


   How can we use the gift of the Sabbath to resolve the three major
fears of life?

   • Fear of the past (that your mistakes will prevent you from
     experiencing happiness in the future).
   • Fear of the future (the challenges and circumstances of liv-
     ing will be too great for you to handle).
   • Fear and anxiety in the present (that robs you of the confi-

THE SABBATH, MARRIAGE, AND PERSONAL HEALTH
(Gen. 2:18-24).

  What other institution dates back to Creation week? Gen. 2:
18-24.


   The creation of the Sabbath and the creation of the institution of
marriage were events closely linked in time. On Friday of Creation
Week, God formed Adam from clay and later Eve from Adam's side.
After a few fleeting hours filled with an escorted tour by Jesus of the
garden home He had made for them, the sun set. Thus, their first full
day together was a Sabbath of rest, fellowship, and worship.
   God later reiterated His desire to see the Sabbath and the family
closely linked. When it was the right time for Jesus to engrave in
granite the great principles of life and righteousness and hand them to
Moses at Sinai, our duty in our relationship with God and our duty in
our relationship with human beings were placed together as com-
mandments four and five. But what about the health connection?
   "Marriage, at least a good one, is good for health. By the same
token a troubled marriage or divorce may be physically harmful.
Married people live longer on an average than do those who are
single. . . . In a study of more than 7,500 adults, epidemiologists, at
Marade Davis . . . found that single men between 45 and 54 are twice
as likely to die in a period of ten years as were married men of the
same age."—David Spiegel, M.D., Mind Body Medicine, p. 334.

  How can Sabbath serve to strengthen our marriages and our
families? What answer to the question is implied in the Sabbath
commandment? Exod. 20:8-11.


    One couple has found an interesting way to unite Sabbath
 and family life for the enrichment of their lives. On Friday
 evening, they find a promise and commit it to memory as a
 source of strength for the coming week. They choose the prom-
 ise based on the challenges they expect to face during the week.
 Throughout the Sabbath, they draw energy from the promise.
 Then during the week, they write it each day at the top of their
 "To Do" lists. Whenever the list is consulted, the verse contin-
 ues to exert its power on their minds. The most rewarding part
 of this helpful habit is that they daily discover that God can
 fulfill for them the promises of His Word.

SABBATH AND SANCTIFICATION (Exod. 31:13).

  What is the relationship between the Sabbath and holiness?
Exod. 31:13.


   True Sabbath observance fosters personal and communal holiness.
The Sabbath is a day for fellowship with God and with other believers.
As such, the Sabbath strengthens family life and church life.
   This thought takes us back to the story of the Fall. A symptom of
sin was the erosion of the interpersonal relationship between Adam
and Eve. Blaming drove a wedge into the intimacy that they had once
enjoyed. Blaming God and blaming each other brought alienation and
dissension.

   At the close of the Last Supper, Jesus gave a new command-
ment. According to that commandment, what is the greatest iden-
tifying sign of the remnant? John 13:34, 35.


   Sanctification (holiness) was the point of greatest contrast between
Jesus' teaching and that of the Pharisees. The Pharisees called them-
selves the "set-apart ones." In their view, the farther you are from the
sinful world, the closer you are to achieving holiness. That is why they
criticized Jesus for eating with sinners and accused Him of Sabbath
breaking. The Pharisees thought of themselves as the guardians of
sanctity. Sabbath was the day upon which they reigned supreme; their
rules governed its observance.

  In what practical ways can Sabbath serve to strengthen holi-
ness in marriages, families, and the church?


    "God has given such signs and symbols as the rainbow, circumci-
 sion, the Passover lamb, the bread and wine of the Lord's Supper,
 and baptism to help us conceptualize our relationship with Him.
 Among these God-given symbols, the Sabbath occupies a unique
 place. It is unique in its origin, as it is the first symbol of divine-
 human fellowship given to mankind. It is unique in its survival
 because it has survived throughout history in spite of attempts to
 outlaw it. It is unique in its function, because it serves as the symbol
 par excellence of the divine election and mission of God's people."—
 Samuele Bacchiocchi, These Times, June 1978, p. 10.

REMOVING THE THORNS FROM THE SABBATH (Mark
3:1-6).

   The benefits to be gained from entering into our Creator's rest are
extolled by all those who prepare for and then experience genuine
Sabbath observance. Thus it is no surprise that after sin entered the
world, one of Satan's most concerted attacks focused on the Sabbath. If
he could take this day of love and undermine it, he would be able to
achieve in the spiritual realm what he had already achieved in the
physical realm. Just as a perfume-laden rose now carries thorns on its
stem, Satan sought to place thorns on the stem of the Sabbath rose. These
"thorns" placed on the Sabbath came from well-meaning people who
said they were acting to protect the sanctity of Sabbath. But Jesus chose
to challenge their approach to Sabbath keeping through healing miracles.

   Before one Sabbath miracle, Jesus gave the reasons for His
reformation of Sabbath keeping as practiced by the Pharisees.
Identify His two reasons. Mark 2:27, 28.


   The rules the Pharisees devised for Sabbath healing seemed to have
the clearest logic. They determined that if a person was in a life-
threatening situation, it was appropriate to do the work of healing and
save the life. While they believed you could seek to prevent the loss of
life, they opposed the promotion of healing. In other words, if your
hand or wrist were cut and bleeding, you could stop the bleeding,
because it was a threat to life. But you could not put salve on the
wound to promote healing!

  What is wrong with that logic, and why did Jesus choose to heal
on the Sabbath? Why did Jesus look on the Pharisees "with an-
ger"? (Mark 3:5, RSV).


   Is healing "a necessary evil" in a world of sin? Should we seek
to limit Sabbath healing as far as possible, or is it consistent with
good Sabbath observance? Matt. 12:11, 12.


    Jesus knew this was no small matter for the Pharisees and
 that it would be one of the primary reasons they would seek to
 kill Him. Why did He choose to make Sabbath healings such a
 confrontational issue?



                                                                      61

FURTHER STUDY: What was involved in God's third act as He
instituted the Sabbath? Gen. 2:3.

   "After resting upon the seventh day, God sanctified it, or set it apart,
as a day of rest for man. Following the example of the Creator, man was
to rest upon this sacred day, that as he should look upon the heavens and
the earth, he might reflect upon God's great work of creation; and that
as he should behold the evidences of God's wisdom and goodness, his
heart might be filled with love and reverence for his Maker."
—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 47.
    God's original plan was that Sabbath observance should bring us
together with Him and one another so that we might experience
personal and community transformation.
    We can think of the church as God's divinely appointed support
group. In recent years, the health benefits of social integration and
support groups have been quantified. In the Journal of Science a few
years ago, James House observed that the relationship between social
isolation and early death is as strong statistically as the relationship
between dying and smoking or high levels of cholesterol. From a
statistical standpoint, the data suggests that it may be as important for
your health to be socially integrated as it is to stop smoking or to
reduce a high cholesterol level.

 DISCUSSION QUESTION:
  What is the purpose of Friday, the preparation day?

   "The day before the Sabbath should be made a day of prepara-
   tion, that everything may be in readiness for its sacred hours. In
   no case should our own business be allowed to encroach upon
   holy time. God has directed that the sick and suffering be cared
   for; the labor required to make them comfortable is a work of
   mercy, and no violation of the Sabbath; but all unnecessary
   work should be avoided. Many carelessly put off till the begin-
   ning of the Sabbath little things that might have been done on
   the day of preparation. This should not be. Work that is ne-
   glected until the beginning of the Sabbath should remain undone
   until it is past."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 296.

SUMMARY: God instituted the Sabbath by ceasing His work of
Creation, resting, and setting this day apart for holy use. As we follow
His example, our spiritual, physical, and mental health are enhanced.
Our families and churches are enriched as unitedly we honor our
Sovereign Creator.

      Elia7                        Jeane Zachary

          Ellen and John Lanes are a couple with a mission. They use their
      individual skills and the gifts of hospitality to win others for Christ in
      the large city of Manado, on the East Indonesian island of Sulawesi
      (Celebes).
          John is a bus driver in Manado. As he guides his bus along his
      appointed route, he looks for ways to give his passengers more than
      just a safe ride to their destination. He tries to guide them to a better
      life. He serves many of the same customers several times a week, and
      John strikes up conversations, seeking to develop a friendship with
      them.
          When a smoker boards his bus, John looks for ways to help the
      person see the danger of the habit. He shares with his clients the latest
      scientific information regarding the health hazards of tobacco or
      alcohol. As he tries to help those who have a problem with a harmful
      habit, he often can share his faith. And if a person expresses an
      interest in spiritual things, John invites him or her to attend one of his
      Bible classes.
          Ellen Lanes is a seamstress. When a woman comes to her with
      sewing jobs, she sees more than a customer; she sees a friend. Through
      repeated contacts with them, Ellen nurtures their friendship and in-
      vites them to attend one of her Bible-study groups.
          The Lord has given John and Ellen Lanes the gifts of hospitality
      and teaching. Every month they bring converts to the Lord. Since John
      and Ellen began their outreach four years ago, the Lord has given them
       75 souls.
          During The Quiet Hour's recent evangelistic thrust, 100 lay evan-
       gelists helped prepare interests for the evangelistic meetings, and more
       than 300 persons were brought to the Lord through this joint evan-
       gelistic effort. Because persons brought to the Lord through group Bible
       studies are carefully nurtured, the dropout rate following baptism is very
       low. This is the spirit of the work in East Indonesia. It is little wonder
       that Manado has one of the highest per-capita Adventist memberships
                                         of any city in the world.

         Unconditional Healing




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Mark 7:24-30; Matt. 4:23,
24; Luke 7:1-10, 36-50; 8:40-56.

      MEMORY TEXT: "Now Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching
      in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom,
      and healing all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease among
      the people" (Matt. 4:23, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Because He loves unconditionally, Christ healed
unconditionally. He healed Jews, Romans, and Samaritans alike. He did
not exact a fee or ask for a commitment to future action or behavior.

    NEED WAS SUFFICIENT MOTIVATION. Although fully concerned
for people's eternal well-being, their physical needs compelled Him to heal.
Jesus asks us to continue His work of disinterested benevolence.
   Jesus was accused of being possessed. He was condemned as a
glutton, a drunkard, and a friend of sinners. The Pharisees said, "He
casts out demons by the prince of demons" (Matt. 9:34, RSV). Note
Jesus' response, recorded in Luke 7:33-35.
   "Jesus spent a disproportionate amount of time with people described
in the Gospels as the poor, the blind, the lame, the lepers, the hungry,
sinners, prostitutes, tax collectors, the persecuted, the downtrodden, the
captives, those possessed by unclean spirits, all who labor and are heavy
burdened, the rabble who know nothing of the law, the crowds, the little
ones, the least, the last, and the lost sheep of the house of Israel. In short,
Jesus associated with ragamuffins."—Brennan Manning, Ragamuffin
Gospel (Sisters, Ore.: Questar Pubs., 1990), p. 49.

HEALING RELIGIOUS LEADERS (Luke 7:36-50).

   What religious leader did Jesus heal? With what result? Luke
7:36-50; Matt. 26:6-13; John 12:1-9.


   Often our focus at the feast in Simon's house is on Mary (John
12:3). But Simon, the Pharisee, was a former leper whom Jesus had
healed (Matt. 26:6; Luke 7:36). In the New Testament, Pharisees are
viewed as Christ's antagonists, concerned with outward form and
behavior, rather than issues of the heart. Christ strongly rebuked them,
calling them children of hell (Matt. 23:15). Understanding the Phari-
sees is essential to understanding Simon, why Jesus healed him, and
the lessons Jesus sought to teach him.
   The Hebrew term translated "Pharisees" means literally "the sepa-
rated ones." They separated themselves for study and the interpreta-
tion of the law. Numbering about 6,000 during this period, they had
preserved strict adherence to Judaism in the late intertestamental
period.
   They "controlled the synagogues and exercised great control over
the general population."—Holman, Bible Dictionary, p. 791.
   The Pharisees separated themselves from the "world" and its de-
filement. Their teaching formed the basis of the Mishnah, a compila-
tion of oral tradition created to interpret scriptural law in order to
protect a person from becoming impure by committing sin.

  How did leprosy impact those infected? How did it affect Simon?
Lev. 13:45, 46.


   As a leper, Simon could not practice Pharisaism. He could not live
at home, go to synagogue worship, or sacrifice at the temple. In the
Jewish mind, he was considered unclean, unholy, and cut off from
God. "Biblical purity lays out conditions under which people may
approach what is holy, most particularly the divine presence."—Bible
Review, June 1995, p. 25.
   Simon's mistake was believing that obedience to the law would bring
salvation rather than accepting Jesus' saving grace. Until healed, Simon
was cut off from society. Knowing he had no hope, he came to Jesus,
who healed him physically and restored him to society and worship.

    How should we work today for those with illnesses such as
 leprosy, tuberculosis, and AIDS? How should the local church
 be involved in caring for these people?


                                                                     65

HEALING COMMON BELIEVERS (Luke 8:40-42, 49-56).

  Why are the healing of Jairus's daughter and the widow's son
important to our understanding of Jesus? Luke 8:40-42, 49-56; 7:
11-16.


   Today we revisit a story introduced earlier in the quarter, but
seeking a different perspective. Jairus held the post of "ruler" of
Capernaum's largest synagogue. He had been appointed to this posi-
tion by Jewish community elders. Each Sabbath, he selected readers
or teachers, examined speakers' discourses, and saw that services
were orderly and in accordance with tradition. He was also respon-
sible for the synagogue's physical maintenance.
    He was with an unclean spirit healed in his synagogue (Luke 4:
31-37) and was aware of the paralytic's being restored (Mark 2:1-12).
He may also have been one of the elders who asked Jesus to heal the
centurion's servant (Luke 7:1-10). Jairus was probably wealthy,
involved in his community, and respected for his lay leadership.

  What impact do you think Jairus's act of falling before Jesus
had on the crowd, the Pharisees, and Jairus's future as a syna-
gogue official? Mark 5:22; Luke 8:41.

    In Mark 5:22, the Greek word for "falling" implies falling from an erect
to a prostrate position. Jairus wasn't kneeling and asking with dignity; he
was on his face begging. Jesus was his last hope. Jesus responded immedi-
ately to Jairus's request and recognition that He was the only solution to the
problem. At the moment when his daughter's death was bluntly announced,
Jesus confirmed that faith was Jairus's motivation. Jesus simply said, "Don't
be afraid; just believe" (Luke 8:50, NIV).

   How was Jesus' action at Nain different from His reaction to
Jairus? Luke 7:13, 14.


    Jesus doesn't ask for faith from the mother, He just acts. The
widow's need and His great compassion for her loss causes an imme-
diate out- flowing of His resurrecting power. The result? "They were
all filled with awe and praised God" (Luke 7:16, NIV).

    Why did Jesus act at times without any expression of faith on
 the part of the healed person?

HEALING OUTCASTS (Luke 8:43-48).

  What were the restrictions and responsibilities for the woman
with the issue of blood? Lev. 15:19-30.


    For twelve years, the woman who touched Jesus had lived in a
perpetual state of ritual impurity. Her alienation was surpassed only
by that of a leper or someone touching the dead. Her condition caused
impurity of her bed, her clothes, and the places she sat. It kept her
from engaging in marital relations. Her uncleanness involved continu-
ous ritual cleansing responsibilities for those who touched her.
    According to the Mishnah, the codified Jewish oral tradition, "The
Temple Mount is still more holy, for no man or woman that has a flux,
no menstruant and no woman after childbirth may enter therein."—
Mishnah, Kelim 1.8. The purification law was given "lest they die in
their uncleanness by their defiling My tabernacle that is among them"
(Lev. 15:31, NASB). This woman was excluded from worship in the
temple, from the presence of God (in the Jewish mind), and from the
synagogue worship experience with family and friends.
    Why did the woman want to be healed secretly? Why did Jesus call
attention to her? Because of her "unclean" state, being in the crowd
was improper. The woman hoped for secret healing to avoid embar-
rassment caused by the public announcement of her "uncleanness."
But her healing, if allowed to remain secret, would have prevented the
public proclamation of her faith and her public recognition of Jesus as
the sole source of restoration.
    "Imperfect though her faith was, the Lord rewarded it. The recov-
ery, moreover, was instant. In one moment the hemorrhage stopped
completely. Health and vigor began to surge through every part of her
body."—William Hendriksen, The Gospel of Luke (Grand Rapids,
Mich.: Baker Bk., 1978), p. 457.
    Jesus' healing brought physical, spiritual, and social restoration.
The woman was restored to full fellowship with her community and
with God.
    "The Lord has a work to be done for the outcasts. . . . This will have
 its place in connection with the proclamation of the third angel's
 message and the reception of Bible truth."—Medical Ministry, p. 311.

   Are there any people in your local church who might feel like
 "outcasts"? What kind of healing do they need to experience?
 What role could you play in bringing such "outcasts" into full
 participation in church life?

HEALING FOREIGNERS (Luke 7:1-10).

   Why did the Jews consider the centurion worthy of Jesus'
attention? Luke 7:4, 5.


    Capernaum was a large town in the first century. Owing to its
location on the road between Sepphoris, Herod Antipas's royal city,
and Damascus, it was normal for it to be garrisoned by Roman troops.
It was not uncommon for such troops to remain in the same city for
many years. The centurion had broken down prejudice toward "Gen-
tiles" and had become an admirer of Judaism.
    The centurion had contributed to the construction of the synagogue
where Jesus preached and healed. This synagogue was large enough to
seat 500 people for Sabbath services. Its foundation still can be seen
under the ruins of a later synagogue. More important, the centurion
was said to be worthy "for he loves our people" (Luke 7:5, NRSV). To
the Jewish elders, this was meaningful because it measured the Roman
centurion's attitude towards Jews, an unrespected ethnic group.

   Why did the centurion think of himself as unworthy? Luke 7:6-8.


    "Though a believer in the true God, the centurion was not yet a full
proselyte and therefore not eligible to participate in religious services."
—SDA Bible Commentary, p. 754.
    The centurion had possibly witnessed some of Jesus' miracles. He
knew His authority and power. He could see it in the lives of many
whom Jesus touched and healed in Capernaum. He felt unworthy of
Jesus' presence in his home and wanted to honor Him as a Jew. Thus
his request, "Say the word, and my servant will be healed" (Luke 7:
7, NIV).
    "The centurion, born in heathenism, educated in the idolatry of
imperial Rome, trained as a soldier, seemingly cut off from spiritual
life by his education and surroundings, and still further shut out by the
bigotry of the Jews, and by the contempt of his own countrymen for
the people of Israel—this man perceived the truth to which the chil-
dren of Abraham were blinded."—The Desire of Ages, p. 317.

   Who are the "Gentiles" in your community? How have you
 reached out to make them part of your personal life and your
 church life? Would they feel comfortable in your church and in
 your home? Would you be comfortable in their homes?

HEALING UNBELIEVERS (Mark 7:24-30; Matt. 15:21-28).

  Why did Jesus first reject the woman's pleas to heal her daughter?
Matt. 15:23.


    Jesus initially responded to the woman as a Jew normally would. She
was a Canaanite (Matt. 5:22). This woman worshiped the same pagan
deities, Baal, Asherah, Anat, that had led to Israel's destruction. To a
faithful Jew, she was seen as lost, condemned to hell, and unworthy of
salvation. Because of their ancestry, Jews called themselves the "chil-
dren of God" and called the heathen "dogs." This is why Jesus used these
metaphors in His response to the Canaanite's plea (Mark 7:27).
    "Christ did not immediately reply to the woman's request. He
received this representative of a despised race as the Jews would have
done. In this He designed that His disciples should be impressed with
the cold and heartless manner in which the Jews would treat such a
case."—The Desire of Ages, p. 400.
    A woman addressing a man in public was culturally unacceptable.
Only women of ill-repute would persistently approach men and try to
engage them in conversation.
    This woman had never been to a synagogue, she didn't understand
Judaism, she hadn't kept the Sabbath or heard Jesus preach, and she
didn't worship the true God. She didn't care about reputation or status
in her community or in the eyes of the disciples. She recognized her
daughter's great need for release from demon possession and trusted
that Jesus held the answer to her healing.
    Jesus didn't ask her to change her lifestyle, become a Jew, listen to
a sermon, or become a disciple before He acted. Falling prostrate
before Him she cried, "Lord, help me" (Matt. 15:25, RSV). This
demonstration of need and faith, Jesus honored. "For there is no
distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of all and
 bestows riches upon all who call upon him. For, 'everyone who calls
 upon the name of the Lord will be saved' " (Rom. 10:12, 13, RSV).
     Jesus' visit to Tyre and Sidon ended this mother's struggle to save her
 daughter from Satan's grip. It is our challenge to interact with society, to
 learn its heartfelt needs, and in fulfilling them, to help others see Jesus as
 the solution to life's problems and as the source of hope.

  Who are the "unbelievers" in your community? How can you
help bring them into a faith relationship with Jesus?


    If someone does not know about Christianity, how can you
 help them understand God's love for them?

these stories influence your witnessing and healing efforts?

  Read "Our Example" in The Ministry of Healing, pp. 17-28, and
"Barriers Broken Down" in The Desire of Ages, pp. 399-403. From
these sources, develop principles that might be applied in our
work for others.


   "Christ recognized no distinction of nationality or rank or creed.
The scribes and Pharisees desired to make a local and national benefit
of the gifts of heaven and to exclude the rest of God's family in the
world. But Christ came to break down every wall of partition. He
came to show that His gift of mercy and love is as unconfined as the
air, the light, or the showers of rain that refresh the earth. . . . He
passed by no human being as worthless, but sought to apply the
healing remedy to every soul."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 25.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Share one way Jesus has given you unconditional healing.

   2. In your church, are there barriers to welcoming people of
      religious backgrounds and social and economic standing
      different from those of the existing members? How can
      these barriers be removed?

SUMMARY: Religious leaders, lay persons, outcasts of culture and
society, foreigners and unbelievers—all experienced Christ's uncon-
ditional healing power. We are called to bring mental, physical, social,
and spiritual healing and restoration to those we contact in our daily
activities. Our kindness and concern for others stands as a living
example of God's unconditional healing in the world.

                    Suffering With Christ
                    As told by Januario de Pena

    Januario Pena often wondered why his childhood had been so
difficult. When his Adventist parents died when he was 8 years old,
he was sent to live with an unbelieving uncle. There he lived in
virtual slavery, forbidden to attend school and forced to work hard
all day. Often he was beaten for the other children's misdeeds.
    When Pena was 16, he left his uncle's home and joined the
guerrilla army fighting for Mozambique's freedom. Pena served in
the army for several years before he was wounded in combat and
discharged.
    Pena returned to his hometown where he met an Adventist
pastor who reintroduced him to Jesus Christ and the faith of his
parents. It was then that Pena realized God had repeatedly saved his
life during his troubled youth. Pena accepted God's love and Jesus'
sacrifice and was baptized. Then he set out to work for God.
    Living off the military retirement pay he received, Pena traveled
from district to district, telling people about God's grace. Because
the war created a deep suspicion of strangers, Pena introduced
himself as an evangelist to the traditional authority or district leader.
The area leader was compelled to introduce Pena to the people and
provide him a place to hold meetings. This made Pena's work
somewhat easier because the people knew who he was before he
started witnessing. He studied with anyone who showed interest
and prepared many for baptism. When a group was ready for
baptism, Pena would summon a minister to baptize them. Then he
moved to another area and began again. In eight years Pena planted
15 new churches, all of which continue to grow and multiply.
    But Pena has suffered for his faith. Once he was accused of being
a spy. He was tied up and spent the night in prison, under threat of
death. After praying well into the night, he received assurance from
God that his life would be spared. Three of the churches Pena
planted were in Muslim areas, where he met with intense persecu-
 tion. And after one young man accepted the Adventist message, his
 family tried to kill Pena.
    The civil war in Mozambique is over, but the war for the human
 soul continues, and Pena continues to seek recruits to enlist in God's
 army. And God continues to reward his efforts with baptisms and
 new churches.

  Januario Alssone de Pena is a lay evangelist living and
working in Mozambique, East Africa.

                  The Mantle of
                    Healing




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 10:1-8; 25:34-40; Luke
4:16-19; John 4:7-29; Rom. 12:15; James 5:14, 15.

   MEMORY TEXT: "As you go, preach this message: 'The king-
   dom of heaven is near.' Heal the sick . . . . Freely you have
   received, freely give" (Matthew 10:7, 8, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Jesus' definition of gospel preaching included
the work of healing. Gospel work means more than presenting theo-
logical truth. Jesus commissioned His disciples, and us, to share His
love in a world that seriously needs physical and emotional healing.

   PREACHING AND HEALING ARE INSEPARABLE MINIS-
TRIES. "Jesus as the Messiah was the bringer of 'health and salva-
tion.' The Christian picture of Jesus as the good Physician, the Sav-
iour of both the body and the soul, is well grounded upon the stories of
the Gospels. That Jesus himself perceived the connection between his
healing ministry and his redemptive mission is obvious from such a
saying as: 'They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they
that are sick: I came not to call the righteous but sinners' (Mark 2:17).
Or again, he speaks the same word to the Sinner-Woman (Luke 7:50)
and to the woman with an issue (Mark 5:34): 'Thy faith hath saved
thee.' "—Alan Richardson, A Theological Wordbook of the Bible (New
York, N.Y.: McMillan, 1962), p. 103.
   Doors that are closed to him who merely preaches the gospel will
often open to the dedicated medical missionary. The ministry of heal-
ing is one of God's chosen ways to reach hearts.

AUTHORIZED MINISTRY (Matt. 10:1-8).

   The form and content of the mission the Christian church embraces
must always be those that Jesus Christ has authorized. There are many
kinds of godly works done in the world, but true Christians, from the
time of the apostles until now, have sought to reflect the works that
Christ instructed and patterned. Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, any-
one who has faith in me will do what I have been doing. He will do
even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father" (John
14:12, NIV).

  What were the primary components of the ministry that Christ
authorized His disciples to conduct? Why were these components
primary? Matt. 10:7, 8.

   Although we do not see people miraculously raised from the dead
today, Christ still empowers us to minister both spiritually and through
medicine.

  How can Christians be involved today in the two ministries that
He originally authorized?

   "The Bible constantly implies that there is such a connection [be-
tween the physical and the spiritual]; the frequent metaphorical use of
bodily diseases as a symbol of spiritual malaise (e.g., Isaiah 1:5)
points to a deep and mysterious relation. The crude but widespread
view that all sickness is a punishment for sin is rejected by Job and by
Jesus himself (Luke 13:1-5; John 9:1-3); but this must not be taken as
a denial of any relationship between sickness and sin."—Alan Richardson,
A Theological Word Book of the Bible, p. 103.
   This dual ministry was the way Jesus helped and healed the para-
lytic. He showed that He met both spiritual and physical health needs
in one work.

   What healing ministries named in 1 Corinthians 12:27-30 would
it be appropriate to expect in the church today? Can modern
"healers" be included in the list of God's ordained ministries, or
did the apostle Paul write only for his time in this regard?


   How can church members pursue a combination of spiritual
 and physical healing for themselves and for others?




                                                                     73
Monday                                               November 24
MINISTRY OF HEALING THROUGH OPENNESS (John 4:
7-29).

   Modern medical science recognizes that physical healing is has-
tened when the patient is enjoying emotional and spiritual health.

   Have you ever observed or experienced the positive impact of spir-
itual well-being on physical health? Explain.


   In a presentation for the National Institutes of Health at Dartmouth
Medical School in March 1995, Elisabeth McSherry, M.D., M.P.H.,
said: "For many years, up until the present, most patients have kept
their religious faith, its content and practice, or their strongest ultimate
values, quite private from their Internist, Orthopod or Psychiatrist to
prevent the dissonance they expected would occur between their pri-
mary values and those constructed by medical scientists. Thus in a
sense, because patients could not be affirmed in their most important
personal resource, their values, motivation, purpose in life, religious
coping skills, religiously-based health optimism, the patients at the
hands of many health-care providers suffered a kind of 'deprivation
abuse,' deprived of affirmation, appreciation and utilization of their
strongest inner strength to fight for their health and healthier out-
comes."

   Review Jesus' interview with the woman at the well (John 4:
7-29). By teaching and example, what was Jesus saying about the
dynamics of honesty and openness.


   "Because the view which Jesus took contemplated the individual as
an integer [a complete person], he was able to envisage more clearly
than his predecessors the influence of body and mind upon each other.
While he was always concerned to heal the sick in body, he invariably
paid close attention to the mind and spirit of the sufferer. Insofar as
they are recorded in any detail, his interviews with sick people seem to
have had as one of their aims the uncovering of evidence pointing to a
deficient relationship between the sufferer and his environment. His
encounter with the Samaritan woman (John 4) transformed what might
have been a casual conversation into a powerful therapeutic analysis
which . . . confronted her with the person of the living Christ as the
answer to her deepest needs. This interview is a superb example of
nondirective counseling."—The Interpreters Dictionary of the Bible,
vol. 2, p. 546.

MINISTRY OF HEALING THROUGH PRESENCE (Matt. 25:34-40).

   Many "smiling" people are desperately lonely. Sin divides people,
alienates families and friends, and leaves them to suffer alone. Illness
in many cases can be traced to loneliness.

   How can Christians relate to the tragedy of loneliness? Matt. 25:
34-40.


   "The beginning and the end of all Christian leadership is to give
your life for others. Thinking about martyrdom can be an escape
unless we realize that real martyrdom means a witness that starts with
the willingness to cry with those who cry, laugh with those who laugh,
and to make one's own painful and joyful experiences available as
sources of clarification and understanding."—Henri J. Nouwen, The
Wounded Healer (New York, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1979), p. 72.
    Jesus taught that when we are sick we need "visits" to be healed.
Usually the "sheep and goats" illustration of Matthew 25 is inter-
preted in a way that emphasizes that Christians need to be involved in
caring ministries. There is truth in that perspective. But Jesus person-
alized His teaching by saying, "As you did it to one of the least of
these my brethren, you did it to me" (Matt. 25:40, RSV). Visiting
others should be largely focused on the benefit we bring to them and
not on the benefit we receive.
    The presence of a friend or acquaintance can have a significant
impact on the physical, mental, and spiritual health of the one who is
visited. Recent research has shown that hospital patients recover from
their illnesses significantly more rapidly when they have meaningful
spiritual visits. An experimental study at an affiliate of Harvard Medi-
cal Center showed that 331 open-heart surgery patients who were
randomly assigned to receive daily special chaplain care, had shorter
postoperative lengths of stay by two days when compared with
patients who did not have chaplaincy visits. Translated into economic
 factors, the cost difference was an average $4,200 per patient.

  How can church members be a spiritual presence for those who
are lonely?


     "In almost every community there are large numbers who do not
 listen to the preaching of God's word or attend any religious service. If
 they are reached by the gospel, it must be carried to their homes. Often
 the relief of their physical needs is the only avenue by which they can
 be approached."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 144.

                                                                       75

MINISTRY OF HEALING THROUGH LISTENING (Rom.
12:15).

   When people need help, we usually tell them what they need. But
what we think they need may not be what they really need; we could
be merely satisfying our own personal needs.

   What does Romans 12:15 teach us about effectively entering
into the experiences of others?


   Just as we can listen intently to the story of one who is rejoicing, so
we can listen intently when someone is weeping—or, suffering from
physical, emotional, or spiritual pain. A significant inhibitor of the
healing process is denial of the reality of our condition. When some-
one we trust prompts us to share our feelings and then listens to what
we say, we gradually accept what we tell about ourselves as reality.
Then physical, emotional, and spiritual healing follows.
   "What the active listener really does is to make it easy for the patient
to be herself, openly to talk about her real feelings and, in many in-
stances, honestly to face her situation. To put it another way, the purpose
of active listening is to enable a person to make use of you, the listener,
to help her deal with her own needs and grow as a person. The idea then
is not for you to solve her problem, or even to give advice. You act
somewhat like a talking mirror, reflecting back to her what you hear, see,
or sense. To this you may add the occasional brief comment. Through
this exchange the patient very often will come to her own conclusions or
find her own solutions."—J. Daryl Furlong, The Ministry of Listening
(Chicago, Ill.: ACTA Pubns., 1987), p. 35.

  In what ways does the Bible support the concept that suffering
people need empathetic listeners? Matt. 26:36-46.


   During His terrible night in Gethsemane, Jesus was in great need of
the disciples' sympathy and prayers; He longed for companionship. If
only the disciples had stayed awake to be with Him, to listen and give
spiritual support, how helpful they could have been to Him! The
record suggests that Jesus needed to talk; but no one was listening.

    Read "Gethsemane" in The Desire ofAges, pp. 685-697. In the
 light of Jesus' words, "as you did it to one of the least of these my
 brethren, you did it to me" (Matt. 25:40, RSV), consider how to
 be a better listener when others are experiencing their
 "Gethsemanes."

MINISTRY OF HEALING THROUGH PRAYER AND THE
WORD (James 5:14, 15).

   "Some were sick through their sinful ways. . . . Then they cried to
the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them . . . he sent forth his
word, and healed them, and delivered them from destruction" (Ps.
107:17-20, RSV).

   What are the means, according to the Bible, by which we can
seek healing? James 5:14, 15; John 14:13, 14.


   Referring to Psalm 107, Ellen White wrote: "God is just as willing
to restore the sick to health now as when the Holy Spirit spoke these
words through the psalmist. And Christ is the same compassionate
physician now that He was during His earthly ministry. . . . His
disciples in this time are to pray for the sick as verily as the disciples
of old prayed."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 226.

  Are there other conditions for healing beyond asking through
prayer? Ps. 66:18; 1 John 1:9.


   Clearly, obtaining the object we desire is contingent on a meaningful
spiritual relationship with Him. "There must be purity of heart, purity of
motive, purity of desire, if our prayers are to be in His name. God is
greater than His promises, and often gives more than either we desire or
deserve but He does not always do so. So, then, if any specific petition is
not granted, we may feel sure that God is calling us to examine our
hearts."—Unknown Christian, The Kneeling Christian (Grand Rapids,
Mich.: Zondervan, 1986), p. 96.
   "Many persons bring disease upon themselves by their self-
indulgence. They have not lived in accordance with natural law or the
principles of strict purity. Others have disregarded the laws of health
in their habits of eating and drinking, dressing, or working. Often
some form of vice is the cause of feebleness of mind or body. Should
these persons gain the blessing of health, many of them would con-
tinue to pursue the same course of heedless transgression of God's
natural and spiritual laws, reasoning that if God heals them in answer
to prayer, they are at liberty to continue their unhealthful practices and
to indulge perverted appetite without restraint."—The Ministry of
Healing, pp. 227, 228.

 thoughts and beliefs?

FURTHER STUDY: Consider the elements involved in Jesus' minis-
try as a guide to the kind of ministry we are called to conduct (Luke 4:
16-19). How well do you think the Seventh-day Adventist Church has
followed the teaching and healing example of Jesus?

   Read "Teaching and Healing" in The Ministry of Healing, pp.
139-160. Note the statements that call for a "new" way of doing
the work of the church.

   "Christ's method alone will give true success in reaching the people.
The Saviour mingled with men as one who desired their good. He
showed His sympathy for them, ministered to their needs, and won
their confidence. Then He bade them, 'Follow Me.'.. .
   "We should ever remember that the object of the medical mission-
ary work is to point sin-sick men and women to the Man of Calvary,
who taketh away the sin of the world. By beholding Him, they will be
changed into His likeness. We are to encourage the sick and suffering
to look to Jesus and live. Let the workers keep Christ, the Great
Physician, constantly before those to whom disease of body and soul
has brought discouragement. Point them to the One who can heal both
physical and spiritual disease. Tell them of the One who is touched
with the feeling of their infirmities. Encourage them to place them-
selves in the care of Him who gave His life to make it possible for
them to have life eternal. Talk of His love; tell of His power to save.
   "This is the high duty and precious privilege of the medical mis-
sionary. And personal ministry often prepares the way for this. God
often reaches hearts through our efforts to relieve physical suffer-
ing."—The Ministry of Healing, pp. 143, 144.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. "In the work of the gospel, teaching and healing are never
     to be separated."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 141. How
     might your local congregation respond to this statement?

   2. Is ministry to the sick an activity that Christians should
      leave to health professionals, or is it a ministry in which
      anyone can be involved? Explain.

SUMMARY: Physical, mental, and spiritual healing accompany the
work of Christ's followers as they empathetically enter into the lives
of those who suffer and as they minister through prayer and the Word
of God.

                                  Finding Jesus
                                    J. H. Zachary

           While some people come to Christ in one giant step, others are
        guided by many faithful witnesses. The journey of Jesus Hagad
        [Hay-SOOS Ha-GOD] of the Philippines started with one small
        voice.
           "For 17 years I served God as a priest," Jesus said. "Then one
        day a voice told me, 'Jesus Christ is not in the Eucharist [conse-
        crated communion elements].' " This revelation began a chain of
        questions in the priest's mind. If Christ was not in the Eucharist,
        what other treasured church rituals were not based on God's
        Word? As Jesus began to question his religious experience, he laid
        aside his prayer book and opened his heart to God in soul-searching
        prayer.
            Feelings of guilt flooded over him as he realized that man-made
        rituals could not remove sin. He had no peace because he was not
        sure that God forgave and accepted him. But, like Jacob, he
        continued to wrestle with God in prayer. He was thrilled to see
        God respond to his pleas. As he accepted Christ's promise of
        forgiveness, God became real to him. He found peace.
            Jesus left the priesthood and joined a Protestant church. The
        Lord blessed him with a wife and four children, but he kept
        searching for God's truth. In early 1996 he attended Adventist
        evangelistic meetings, where he learned that Sunday was not
        God's holy day. This revelation stunned him, but as he and his
        wife read the Bible texts upholding the Sabbath, they asked them-
        selves how they could have kept Sunday for so many years when
        the Bible is so clear that the seventh day is the Sabbath of the
         Lord.
            As Jesus learned more about the Adventist church, he remembered
         Adventist children with whom he had attended school as a boy. He
         wanted his own children to live as those children did. He and his
                                  family prayed together, asking for God's for-
                                  giveness and direction. They decided to fol-
                                  low God's leading to keep the Sabbath, and
                                  were baptized, along with their eldest daugh-
                                  ter. Jesus testifies simply, "I did not find
                                  Jesus in religious ceremonies; I found Him
                                  in the Bible—and the Adventist Church."

                Healers in Need
                  of Healing




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Isa. 53:4-6.

   MEMORY TEXT: "But we have this treasure in jars of clay to
   show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us"
   (2 Corinthians 4:7, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Ultimate healing, from God's perspective, in-
volves the whole integrated person and will never be achieved until
the sin that separates us from God is addressed. Even when restoring
physical health and function, Christ always had as His first priority
reconciliation with God.

   HEALERS NEED HEALING. Because the ultimate source of death,
decay, and disease is sin, those involved in healing ministry are sinners
trying to help other sinners to overcome and to achieve reconciliation
with God. Healers also have the need for healing. This fact makes the
successful healer empathetic and willing to give all the glory to God,
who is the only source of life and health. If the "treasure" were not in
"jars of clay," we might be tempted to take the credit, which would shut
God's channel and preclude our ability to assist others to experience true
spiritual, physical, and emotional health. Peter and Paul had to experi-
ence personal healing in order to become healers of others.
   "The continuity of Christian influence is the secret of its power,
and this depends on the steadfastness of your manifestation of the
character of Christ. Help those who have erred, by telling them of your
experiences. Show how, when you made grave mistakes, patience,
kindness, and helpfulness on the part of your fellow workers gave you
courage and hope."—The Ministry of Healing, pp. 494, 495.

PETER FALLS SHORT (Luke 22:20-34).

   How did Peter behave in the final hours of Christ's life? What
did his actions reveal about his character? Luke 22:20-34, 54-62;
John 18:10, 11.


   Peter apparently was a "natural" leader exhibiting attractive attributes
that caused others to follow him. Obviously, there were elements in
Peter's character that led Jesus to choose him as an apostle. Yet the
passages above tell the story of Peter's bitter and abject failure.
   Before one criticizes Peter for failing the Lord after His arrest, it
might be wise to consider the question of the absence of the other
apostles, who had apparently gone into hiding.
   What was the true nature of Peter's deficiency? Was it lack of
courage, of good intentions, of a desire to be loyal to his Lord and
Friend? Was Peter a hypocrite? Ponder these questions in order to
probe Peter's deficiencies and the healing that this future healer would
need.
   What was the root cause of Peter's vulnerability to temptation and
failure? Do you believe Peter was sincere in his statements of determi-
nation to support and follow the Lord? Why do you think as you do?
Did Peter lack courage?

   What message do you believe was conveyed in the Lord's look
at Peter after the final denial? Luke 22:60-62.


   "Peter had not designed that his real character should be known. In
assuming an air of indifference he had placed himself on the enemy's
ground, and he became an easy prey to temptation. If he had been
called to fight for his Master, he would have been a courageous
soldier; but when the finger of scorn was pointed at him, he proved
himself a coward. Many who do not shrink from active warfare for
their Lord are driven by ridicule to deny their faith. By associating
with those whom they should avoid, they place themselves in the way
of temptation. They invite the enemy to tempt them, and are led to say
and do that of which under other circumstances they would never have
been guilty. The disciple of Christ who in our day disguises his faith
through dread of suffering or reproach denies his Lord as really as did

   "In that gentle countenance he read deep pity and sorrow, but there
was no anger there. The sight of that pale, suffering face, those
quivering lips, that look of compassion and forgiveness, pierced his

PETER EXPERIENCES HEALING (John 21:1-19).

   We can only begin to imagine the pain and agony that Peter felt after
his denial and the subsequent events of Jesus' mock trial and agonizing
death. Even after the reality of the resurrection, it would be normal for
Peter to carry the scars of this experience in his mind and heart.

    Attempt to put yourself in Peter's place and imagine what some
of these scars might include; for example, crushed self-respect, unwor-
thiness, and guilt. Base your list on how you might have felt.


  Describe Jesus' healing ministry for Peter (John 21:1-19). Why
do you think Jesus would have picked this place and occasion to
confront and heal Peter?


   What was the reason for Jesus' insistent questions regarding
Peter's love for Him? If you were Peter, what would the words of
the Lord "Feed my lambs" have meant to you?


   "Peter was naturally forward and impulsive, and Satan had taken
advantage of those characteristics to overthrow him. Just before the
fall of Peter, Jesus had said to him, 'Satan hath desired to have you,
that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith
fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.' Luke
22:31, 32. That time had now come, and the transformation in Peter
was evident. The close, testing questions of the Lord had not called
out one forward, self-sufficient reply; and because of his humiliation
and repentance, Peter was better prepared than ever before to act as
shepherd to the flock.
   "The first work that Christ entrusted to Peter on restoring him to
the ministry was to feed the lambs. This was a work in which Peter
had little experience. It would require great care and tenderness, much
patience and perseverance. It called him to minister to those who were
young in the faith, to teach the ignorant, to open the Scriptures to
them, and to educate them for usefulness in Christ's service. Hereto-
fore Peter had not been fitted to do this, or even to understand its
importance. But this was the work which Jesus now called upon him
to do. For this work his own experience of suffering and repentance
had prepared him."—The Desire of Ages, p. 812.

PETER AS HEALER (Acts 3:1-16).

   Study Acts 3:1-16 as a dramatic example of Peter's being used
to feed the lambs.


   There are probably scores of other examples that were not re-
corded. As you read and ponder this account, it is important to con-
sider how Peter is different from his precrucifixion persona. The
natural endowments of candor, courage, and transparency have been
transformed by his failure and by what he learned from that experi-
ence. But equally important is what he learned and incorporated from
his experience of restoration and healing.

   How would Peter's past experience have made him a more
effective healer? List the ways Peter is different in this account
from the man portrayed in Luke 22.


   "Of the first apostolic miracle much could be written. Peter told the
lame man to attempt the seemingly impossible, namely, to rise up and
walk. But assured of Christ' s ability, the lame man took the step of
faith. Divinely healed, he crystallized his faith by his clear testimony.
There are cripples among us still cripples in morals, in will-power
also, alas, cripples through their own sins or through sins of others.
How full the world is of poor, disabled souls, so spiritually impotent!
They lie at the doors of the Church, but are not cured. As Peter became
the medium of healing, so only as the love of God flows through us
can the dying spiritual cripples of our times be blessed."—Herbert
Lockyer, All the Books and Chapters of the Bible (Grand Rapids,
Mich.: Zondervan), p. 247.
   "The man at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple is the illustration of a
constant fact: approximation to God is a habit of humanity in need.
Mendicants are not often found at the doors where an infidel lecture
has been delivered. In speaking to the man, Peter revealed the essen-
tial meaning of Christianity. He was not able to minister to the man in
 material things so far as silver and gold were concerned. He was,
however, able to communicate to him something which would make
 him master of his disability. . . .
    "Faith in His [Jesus'] name was the avenue through which God had
 wrought the wonder. No glory accrued to man from what had hap-
 pened; nor to the man who was healed, for his faith was not brought
 into play at all; none to the apostles, as they clearly declared."
 —G. Campbell Morgan, An Exposition of the Whole Bible (Grand
 Rapids, Mich.: Baker Book, 1959), p. 451.

                                                                     83

SAUL OF TARSUS OFF THE MARK (Acts 7:57, 58).

  What kind of man was Saul of Tarsus before He met Christ?
Acts 7:57, 58; 8:3.


   In this brief passage, we encounter another man with very substantial
human endowments whom God in His all-knowing wisdom ordained to
carry out a great work for His kingdom. Saul of Tarsus was a Hebrew of
great training and advantage. He had studied with the eminent teacher
Gamaliel. He was a Roman citizen. As a young man, he had attributes of
leadership that moved him to the forefront of the effort to wipe out the
"heretical" Christian group. He apparently thought he was serving God's
cause in his zealous efforts to destroy Christians.

   Do you believe that Saul of Tarsus would have sensed any need
of healing or change? What would you list as the admirable,
natural character traits of Saul of Tarsus before conversion? How
was Saul of Tarsus missing God's mark for him at this time?


   "This is the first mention of St. Paul in the Holy Scriptures [Acts
7:57]. His agency in the martyrdom of St. Stephen is mentioned with
peculiar emphasis here . . . with the design probably of showing the
power of Divine Grace in the change wrought thereby from Saul, the
Persecutor of the Church, to Paul, the Preacher of the Gospel. . . .
   "Here also, it seems, we may be permitted to recognize one main
reason why the History of the Acts is principally occupied in narrating
the actions and sufferings of two apostles, St. Peter and St. Paul, the
one having shown his weakness in denying Christ, the other his fury in
persecuting Him.
   "These two names are noble trophies of the victories of the Holy
Ghost.
   "St. Paul would doubtless have been anxious to make public repa-
ration as far as he was able, for the wrong done by himself to the
blessed Martyr. This desire manifested itself afterwards in his public
declaration at Jerusalem, recorded in Acts 22:20. "When the blood of
Thy Martyr, Stephen, was being shed, I myself also was standing
there, and consenting to the deed, and holding the raiment of those
who were killing him." He could not make better amends, than by
confessing his own share in the martyrdom, as is done here (7:58;
8:1)."—Christopher Wordsworth, The New Testament of our Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ, 1874, vol. 2, p. 73.

PAUL EXPERIENCES HELPLESSNESS AND HEALING
(Acts 9:1-19).

   What do you think was the significance of Saul's being made
blind, speechless, and helpless? What do you think was the signifi-
cance of his receiving restoration of his physical sight through
another human being? What do you think Paul might have learned
from the obedience of Ananias, who had serious reservations about
him? Acts 9:1-19.


    Like Peter, the Lord saw, in the imperfect clay of Saul, attributes
that, once transformed, once healed, would make him a mighty ser-
vant in the cause of the kingdom.
    Alexander Solshenitsyn's terror-filled days in the Gulag Archi-
pelago have some intriguing parallels to Paul's experience. He wrote:
"It was granted me to carry from my prison years on my bent back,
which nearly broke beneath its load, the essential experience: how a
human being becomes evil and now good. In the intoxication of my
youthful successes I had felt myself to be infallible, and I was there-
fore cruel. In the surfeit of power I was a murderer, and an oppressor.
In my most evil moments I was convinced that I was doing good, and I
was well supplied with systematic arguments. And it was only when,
in the Gulag Archipelago, on rotting prison straw that I sensed within
myself the first stirrings of good. Gradually it was disclosed to me that
the line separating good and evil passes, not through states, nor be-
tween classes, nor between political parties either but right through
every human heart and through all human hearts. . . . And that is why I
turn back to the years of the imprisonment and say, sometimes to the
astonishment of those about me: 'Bless you prison!" " (Quoted by
Malcolm Muggeridge in Conversion, pp. 116, 117).
    Speaking of his own spiritual journey that climaxed in conversion late
 in life, the late BBC commentator Malcolm Muggeridge wrote: "Sud-
denly, accountability, joy, peace, illumination, total submersion in God's
 universal love, come to the Undergraduate and he sits or moves about in
 ecstasy. If he looks out of the window, it is to see Paradise; if he is with
 other human beings, they are angels; if he closes his eyes and meditates,
 he floats away from his physical existence and desires, from his very
 prayers, and devotions, and finds himself near to some ineffable, ulti-
 mate truth, breathing the very perfume of God's love and loitering in the
 very precincts of Heaven."—Muggeridge, p. 39.

   Have you ever wished for a Damascus experience like Paul's?
 Do you ever fear God may allow some calamity in your life so
 you could recognize need for healing?

                                                                         85

FURTHER STUDY: What do the following passages reveal regard-
ing Paul as a restorer and healer? Acts 9:26-30; 11:22-26; 16:16-40;
2 Tim. 3:9-11.

    Paul appears to have been an intense and energetic man. After his
encounter with Christ, he demonstrated the same zeal for spreading
the gospel as he had in persecuting the church. However, his past and
his reputation were barriers, and without the endorsement and support
of Barnabas, his acceptance by the original apostles might have been
difficult. Barnabas spoke up for Paul in Jerusalem and brought him
into the work for the Gentiles in Antioch. Paul experienced healing
and baptism from Ananias and invaluable support from Barnabas.
    Paul seems to have needed further growth in grace to become a
great restorer and healer. He refused to give John Mark the second
chance that Barnabas was determined to give. Interestingly, even
though the conflict was sharp and both Paul and Barnabas believed
they were correct, they continued to be used of God, and the work was
multiplied. Evidently, over time, Paul came to feel differently about
John Mark and changed his earlier judgment. We can all look forward
to this kind of growth in our experience with Christ.


 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. List some of the factors that might have led, over time, to
     Paul's changed view of John Mark.

   2. Are disagreements between Christians troublesome to God?
      How might disagreements produce understanding and heal-
      ing? How should Christians conduct themselves when dis-
      agreements occur?

    "Since the earlier years of his profession of faith, Mark's Christian
experience had deepened. As he had studied more closely the life and
death of Christ he had obtained clearer views of the Saviour's mission,
its toils and conflicts. Reading in the scars in Christ's hands and feet
the marks of His service for humanity, and the length to which self-
abnegation leads to save the lost and perishing, Mark had become
willing to follow the Master in the path of self-sacrifice. . . . In the face
of severe trial and adversity, Mark continued steadfast, a wise and
beloved helper of the apostle."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 455.

SUMMARY: Before the apostles were qualified to be Christ's instru-
ments for healing, they themselves needed spiritual healing. Those
who would bring physical and spiritual healing to others must experi-
ence Christ's healing touch.

                       By Faith, Not by Sight, Part 1
                                 Velaphi Gumbo

          Velaphi [Vel-AHP-he] Gumbo was born in a village in Zimba-
      bwe where the people worship the spirits of their ancestors.
      When he was 5 years old, his uncle visited the family and noticed
      that Velaphi was blind. Uncle told his parents to send the boy to
      Solusi Elementary School, where blind children are taught.
          Velaphi and his father boarded a bus for the three-hour trip to
      Solusi. His father helped him move into his dormitory room then
      said goodbye and left. Velaphi felt lonely, but his dorm mates
      introduced him to other children and helped him learn his way
      around school. On Saturday the children went to church. Velaphi
      had never been to church, but he loved Sabbath School and soon
      was joining the other children as they sang songs about Jesus.
          Velaphi's days took on a comfortable routine of classes, playtime,
      homework, and worship. He especially enjoyed worship. The
      songs seemed so much happier than those that people sang in his
      village. He learned that his body is the temple of God, and he
      should keep it clean and pure and not eat unclean foods or smoke
      or drink beer. And he learned that God loves him and forgives his
      sins when he asks.
          When Velaphi went home for vacation, his family crowded
      around to greet him. At dinnertime, everyone started to eat—
      except Velaphi. He had learned to pray before meals. When his
       father allowed him to give thanks for the food, Velaphi was glad.
       After dinner Velaphi told his family what he had learned at
       school. He told them some Bible stories he had heard and talked
       about going to church. He told them about the difference between
       clean and unclean foods and about keeping the Sabbath. But his
       parents did not like some of Velaphi's new ideas; they did not
       want to change their ways. And when Velaphi told them he
                                wanted to be a pastor someday, they
                                laughed. "How can a blind boy from a
                                little village become a pastor?" But
                                Velaphi's sister, Dezzy, did not laugh.
                                That night Velaphi told God that he wanted
                                to serve Him no matter what his family
                                said.

      Jesus the Champion of
      Choice and Liberation




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Mark 1:40-45; John 3:16,
17; 5:2-9; Luke 15:11-24; Matt. 15:21-28.

   MEMORY TEXT: "If, because of one man's trespass, death
   reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive
   the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in
   life through the one man Jesus Christ" (Romans 5:17, RSV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Christ's greatest desire is that all human beings
will experience the joy of full restoration to the family of God. All are
His creation, all are loved unconditionally, but only those are given
eternal life who accept the gift provided for them on Calvary's cross.

    OUR GREAT HEALER ASKS US TO CHOOSE HIM. A sig-
nificant part of Christ's healing ministry was to liberate people from
the misconceptions cultivated by their religious leaders. He dispelled
the notion that illness is always God's expression of anger or disap-
proval in response to an individual's sinful conduct.
    Christ died to give us an option, a choice. The cross provided
expiation for the sins of every human being (1 John 2:2). But our sins
were not forgiven at the cross. The death of Christ provided for the
forgiveness of all our sins, because "He himself bore our sins in his
body on the tree" (1 Peter 2:24, NIV). We are invited today to "receive
the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness" (Rom.
5:17). The condition of forgiveness, cleansing, and healing still stands:
"If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins,
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness" (1 John 1:9).

SIN AND SUFFERING (Mark 1:40-45).

   What popular misconception did Jesus dispel when He healed
the leper? Mark 1:40-45.


   In the story recorded in Mark, chapter 1, Jesus healed a man
suffering with leprosy. It was commonly believed that leprosy was
God's punishment for sin. The leper became an outcast from society
and was pronounced unclean by the church.
   Christ was constantly seeking to dispel the common misunderstand-
ings about God. God was pictured by religious leaders as harsh, exacting,
and judgmental. But Jesus, "God with us," touched, healed, and restored
people, indicating that illness is very often not a judgment by God, but
the natural, inevitable result of humanity's fallen condition, resulting
from the wrong choice of our first parents. It was His purpose to restore
our relationship with God and to make us whole.
   "The souls who came to Jesus felt in His presence that even for
them there was escape from the pit of sin. The Pharisees had only
scorn and condemnation for them; but Christ greeted them as children
of God, estranged indeed from the Father's house, but not forgotten by
the Father's heart. And their very misery and sin made them only the
more the objects of His compassion. The farther they had wandered
from Him, the more earnest the longing and the greater the sacrifice
for their rescue."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 186.

  How does our understanding of God's character influence the
way we view suffering and sickness?


   What can we do to help suffering people understand that God
loves them infinitely, and that He wants them to be part of His
family on earth and in heaven?


   "Mark wrote for the Romans, whose watchword was power. . . . Mark
is eloquent with, and exhibits the omnipotence of the mighty miracle-
worker, and likewise the omnipotence of love as the crowning passion
and resurrection of God's Servant. Miracles are prominent rather than
parables or discourses. At least 20 of Christ's astonishing miracles are
given in detail, and in ten instances Mark adds general statements with-
out going into particulars (1:34). Almost half the book is taken up with
some comprehensive summing up of Christ's ministry of power."
—Lockyer, p. 226.

THE CHOSEN (John 3:16, 17).

  How extensive is God's love? For how many did Christ die?
John 3:16, 17; 1 John 2:2.


    Scripture makes it clear that God is seeking after every person
because He claims this world and its inhabitants as His rightful pos-
session.
    The problem of sin must be seen in the setting of the great contro-
versy. Human beings are saved by an act of God totally outside of
their own actions or capabilities. Christ came, He died, was raised to
life, and on this basis offers to all humanity the gift of eternal life. God
has provided for all humanity to be saved. Some choose to accept the
gift, while others choose to reject it (Rom. 5:17).
    In John 3:15, 16, "the added elements are the love of God and the
consequent giving of his Son, who is described as the only begotten.
This means unique, one of a kind. Sons by adoption do not become
members of the Godhead. The breadth of the divine love is empha-
sized in that its object is the (whole) world. Though the coming of
Christ involved judgment, as the rest of this section attests, the direct
purpose of that coming, resting on the divine love, was not condemna-
tion but salvation (3:17)."—Wycliffe Bible Commentary, p. 1079.
   "He gave Him not only to live among men, to bear their sins, and die
their sacrifice. He gave Him to the fallen race. Christ was to identify
Himself with the interests and needs of humanity. He who was one with
God has linked Himself with the children of men by ties that are never to
be broken. Jesus is 'not ashamed to call them brethren' (Hebrews 2:11);
He is our Sacrifice, our Advocate, our Brother, bearing our human form
before the Father's throne, and through eternal ages one with the race He
has redeemed— the Son of man. And all this that man might be uplifted
from the ruin and degradation of sin that he might reflect the love of God
and share the joy of holiness."—Steps to Christ, p. 14.

  Why is it that Jesus loves each of us as "family" members but
that we, the family, sometimes don't demonstrate love for one
another? Why was Jesus so helpful to people? In what areas could
you be a volunteer to help others?


    Being "the hand of God" to fallen, sinful human beings often
 forces us outside our comfortable environment and ways of
 being. It challenges us to seek effective ways to minister to those
 who do not know Him.

TOTAL FREEDOM (John 5:2-9).

   Christ frequented the places where the suffering were to be found.
In the story of the healing by the pool, Jesus healed a man who had
been ill for 38 years. The context suggests that the man's sins may
have caused his illness. Yet, on the Sabbath day, Jesus touched him
and made him whole.

   What does the story of Jesus' healing the sick man by the pool
of Bethesda reveal about God's love for sinful human beings?
What does it say about acts of charity and healing and the true
meaning of Sabbath keeping? John 5:2-9.


    "Let us turn to the story of the paralytic at Bethesda. The poor
sufferer was helpless; he had not used his limbs for thirty-eight years.
Yet, Jesus bade him, 'Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.' The sick man
might have said, 'Lord, if thou wilt make me whole, I will obey Thy
word.' But, no, he believed Christ's word, believed that he was made
whole, and he made the effort at once; he willed to walk and he did
walk. He acted on the word of Christ, and God gave the power. He was
made whole.
    "In like manner you are a sinner. You cannot atone for your past
sins; you cannot change your heart and make yourself holy. But God
promises to do all this for you through Christ. You believe that prom-
ise. You confess your sins and give yourself to God. You will to serve
Him. Just as surely as you do this, God will fulfill His word to you. If
you believe the promise—believe that you are forgiven and cleansed—
God supplies the fact; you are made whole, just as Christ gave the
paralytic power to walk when the man believed that he was healed. It
is so if you believe it."—Steps to Christ, pp. 50, 51.
    God obviously desires to open to each of us the wonderful bless-
ings of being His child. In the midst of a chaotic world, God can set us
free; free from the fears that life brings, and free from the fear of
meaninglessness. He can make us whole.
     Acceptance of God's gift of life and His healing touch sets us free
 to live to the fullest extent both now and in the future.

  In what ways do you experience a sense of freedom and liberty?
How do those feelings relate to your sense of being saved?


   What kind of responsibility to our friends and acquaintances
 comes with the freedom we experience?

WHY MUST I CHOOSE? (Luke 15:11-24).

  In the trilogy of the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the lost son in
Luke 15, Jesus teaches that each person is infinitely valuable to Him.
He constantly seeks and desires us to choose Him and His kingdom.
But we still have the authority to say No to God and be lost.

   What choices did the prodigal son make that enabled his father
to restore him to the family? Luke 15:17-20.


   "In this renowned chapter—`a masterpiece of writing and an in-
spired revelation of the heart of God'—the combined work of the
Trinity in redemption is beautifully illustrated in three incomparable
stories. In that of the Lost Sheep, we have the love of the Son, who
gave His life for the sheep. In the Lost Coin, 'the silver piece, part of
the woman's dowry which every married woman wore as a chain
across her forehead,' we can discern the love of the Spirit for sinners.
In the Lost Son, we have a glimpse into the Father-heart of God. Joy is
associated over the recovery of the lost sheep, the lost coin and the lost
son. Do we share the joy of angels over the return of lost souls to
God?"—Lockyer, pp. 237, 238.

  Why would God leave such an important decision up to each
person? John 7:37; Rom. 10:12; Rev. 22:17.


   "All are by their own choice deciding their destiny."—Education,
p. 178.
   "Every man is free to choose what power he will have to rule over
him. None have fallen so low, none are so vile, but that they can find
deliverance in Christ. The demoniac, in place of prayer, could utter
only the words of Satan; yet the heart's unspoken appeal was heard.
No cry from a soul in need, though it fail of utterance in words, will be
unheeded."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 258, 259.
   Freedom of choice has always been intrinsic in God's creation. His
character will not allow Him to force anyone, even if salvation is at
stake. Satan has raised questions about God's character. He has ac-
cused God of arbitrary control and harshness. But Jesus constantly
demonstrated the opposite characteristics.

   To what extent do people of differing personalities and life
situations have the ability to make choices? How can we prevent
circumstances from making our choices for us?

OUTSIDER/INSIDER (Matt. 15:21-28).

   Why did the religious leaders of Christ's day make so many
people feel like outsiders, and how did Jesus make individuals feel
like insiders? Review the story recorded in Matthew 15:21-28.


   A woman who is considered an outsider by the Jews comes seeking
help from Jesus—a Canaanite wanting help for her daughter. Jesus tells
her that He has not come to help her, but the Israelites. But then Jesus
declares that she is a woman of great faith and heals her daughter.

  Why did Jesus at first treat this woman in the way that seems so
rebuffing and alienating?


   The people of Israel were convinced that they alone were God's
chosen; all others were outside God's grace. Jesus taught that faith is
the key to being an insider.
   "In proportion as the woman's supplication became more intense, so
our Lord's remonstrance became more strong. He at first was silent; then
He calls the Jews His sheep, and says that He was sent only to them; then
He calls them His children and the Gentiles dogs. And on this rebuke the
woman frames her reply; she shows a patience and faith, although she
might seem to be treated with scorn. Let them be children and me a dog;
yet as such, I am not forbidden to eat of the crumbs which they let fall.
Our Lord had foreknown that she would answer thus; and therefore He at
first refused, and rebuked her, in order that He might bring out her faith
and humility as an example."—Wordsworth, p. 251.

   Why do we tend to treat others as outsiders if they do not
believe, think, or act as we do?

   This woman made a choice. She believed that Jesus could heal her
daughter, and she would not allow national prejudice to keep her from
her heart's desire.

   "Keep your wants, your joys, your sorrows, your cares, and
 your fears before God. You cannot burden Him; you cannot weary
 Him. He who numbers the hairs of your head is not indifferent to
 the wants of His children.... The relations between God and each
 soul are as distinct and full as though there were not another soul
 upon the earth to share His watchcare, not another soul for whom
 He gave His beloved Son."—Steps to Christ, p. 100.


                                                                      93
Friday                                              December 12
FURTHER STUDY: Compare Job 11:1-6 with Luke 4:16-20. Job's
friends were convinced that the illness he experienced was caused by
his lack of commitment to God, and because of his sins. Sins and
punishment were believed to go hand in hand. Is illness or tragedy
ever a judgment from God? If so, when?

   "The gospel of Jesus means relief for the poor, light for the ignorant,
alleviation of distress for the suffering, and emancipation for the slaves
of sin. Any person who took an interest in relieving the poor was thought
to be particularly righteous, and almsgiving became synonymous with
righteousness . . . . It was often the case that almsgiving was practiced,
not out of sympathetic interest in helping the poor, but from a desire to
earn righteousness . . . . However, genuine, sympathetic concern for the
feelings and needs of our fellow men is one of the best evidences of 'pure
religion' (see James 1:27), of sincere conversion (1 John 3:10, 14), of
love for God (see 1 John 3:17-19; 4:21), and of readiness for entrance
into the kingdom of heaven (see Matt. 25:34-46)."—SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 5, p. 728.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. There are instances recorded in the Bible in which God
     brought illness upon people as a rebuke for their sins. (See 2
     Chron. 26:16-21; Num. 12:9, 10.) Even though your per-
     sonal sins may have resulted in physical illness, how can
     you have the assurance of acceptance by God?

   2. Can the results of sin described in Romans 1:26, 27 be
      overcome? What is the means of spiritual healing for all
      presented in the book of Romans?

   3. Because your neighbor was born physically handicapped,
      she is bitter against God and won't have anything to do
      with religion. At an opportune time, what message of com-
      fort could you bring her?

SUMMARY: Physical suffering is inevitable in a fallen world in
which all humanity inherits the inevitable results of our first parents'
sin. Therefore, very often illness is not the result of personal sin, but
of hereditary weakness or of some calamity not of our causing. Even
when illness is the direct result of our personal sins and indiscretions,
through Christ we can have forgiveness, spiritual cleansing, and ac-
ceptance by.God.

                         By Faith, Not by Sight, Part 2
                                     Velaphi Gumbo

              When Velaphi returned home following his first year at Solusi
          Elementary School, he eagerly told his parents that he wanted to be a
          pastor someday. Because they were not Christians, they laughed.
          "How can a blind boy from a little village become a pastor?" they
          asked.
              But Velaphi's sister, Dezzy, did not laugh. She asked him to tell
          her about God. Whenever they had a chance, Velaphi and Dezzy sat
          under a thorn tree while Velaphi taught her the songs he had learned
          in school and told her stories of God. She was eager to learn.
              Soon vacation ended, and Velaphi returned to Solusi. For several
          years the familiar rhythms of school filled his days. When he visited
          home, his parents did not force him to eat unclean foods, and they no
          longer laughed at his Bible stories, but they still did not want to know
          about God. But Dezzy was always eager to listen. And when Velaphi
          was 12 years old, he helped Dezzy give her life to Jesus.
              The children's parents were angry that Velaphi had taught Dezzy
          about God. Dezzy was sent to her own room, and Velaphi was told
          not to talk to her about Jesus.
              Velaphi also told his cousin about God. The two would go into the
          bush to search for wild fruits, and there Velaphi told him stories from
          the Bible and taught him songs he had learned. The boy wanted to
          become a Christian, but his parents refused to let him. Velaphi
          promised to pray that one day his cousin could decide for himself.
              Velaphi's parents never gave up hope of finding a cure for
          Velaphi's blindness. During one school vacation they arranged for a
          traditional healer to anoint his eyes to cure his blindness, but when
          Velaphi learned that the healer was a witch doctor, he would not let
           her touch him. "I am a Christian," he told her. "I believe in Jesus
          Christ, not in traditional medicines. Let me remain blind now. When
           Jesus comes, I will be able to see."
              His parents were so angry, they refused to continue paying for
           Velaphi's school tuition. But the blind boy returned to Solusi on faith.
           He still wants to become a pastor and often gives Bible studies and
           encourages other young people at Solusi to witness for Jesus as well.
           He testifies, "God has supplied everything that I have; He has made
           me everything that I am. I thank Him and want to give my life back to
           Him."

             Velaphi Gumbo is 18, and a second-year student at Solusi
           Secondary School.

Lesson 12                                            December 14-20

                Christ the Great
                  Connector




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 4:18-20; 11:19; Luke
10:29-37; Acts 16:23-34; Phil. 2:1-8.

   MEMORY TEXT: Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt
   have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thence-
   forth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden
   under foot of men" (Matthew 5:13).

   KEY THOUGHT: What picture do you have of God? Is He a police-
officer, a judge, a disciplinarian? Jesus gave us another picture: our
Father. The throbbing heart of the creation is the love of God for His
world, the love made known in Jesus Christ.

   CHRIST DEMONSTRATED HOW TO BE IN THE WORLD
YET NOT OF THE WORLD. He associated with the social out-
casts, as well as the highly respected and accepted. He was clear about
his mission to save all human beings.
   Jesus did not separate Himself from those He came to save. Through
His healing ministry, He was able to meet the needs of the powerful
and the powerless. When sickness and death threaten, there is no
distinction between rich and poor.
   Christ desires His children to be the salt of the earth, a leavening
influence for good in human society. Opportunities abound for that
mixing to take place in activities and acts that promote healthful living.
   This lesson deals with Christ the great Connector, the One who
unites people to Himself and to one another.

A DISPOSITION OF MIND (Phil. 2:1-8).

   "Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus. . . . But
made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a
servant, and was made in the likeness of men" (Phil. 2:5, 7).

   Read Philippians 2:1-8. What dispositions of mind or ways of
thinking are evident in this passage? Verses 3 and 4 hint at discon-
nectedness. Verses 5-8 describe connectedness.


   Through the incarnation, God took our human flesh. Jesus was the
great Connector of people through the incarnation. By the disposition
of His mind and His character qualities, including His behavior, Jesus
Christ is the great Connector between God and humanity.

   What insights can we draw from Christ's incarnation? John
1:1-5, 9-18.


   God has not rejected this world. This is our Father's world, and
although it is marred by sin, we can still find evidences of His charac-
ter. Christians have an obligation to discover and understand the
principles of nature that govern physical life, as well as the principles
that govern moral and spiritual life.
   The Eternal God is our Father. Through the incarnation, Christ has
assured us that He enjoys our company and wants our friendship.
   "Our sufficiency is found only in the incarnation and death of the
Son of God. . . . All who are one with Christ through faith in Him gain
an experience which is life unto eternal life. . . . Christ became one
with humanity, that humanity might become one in spirit and life with
Him. By virtue of this union in obedience to the Word of God, His life
becomes their life."—Selected Messages, book 1, p. 302.

   The apostle Paul made two contrasting statements. Romans
7:24 states, "0 wretched man that I am." Philippians 4:13 says, "I
can do all things through Christ." Which statement describes the
tone of your life? If the Romans 7:24 problem persists, how can it
be overcome? Compare Romans 8:1-17.


   What is meant by the statement "I can do all things through
 Christ"? Does this mean all things in the absolute or all things
 that God asks of us?


                                                                     97

CONNECTED WITH OUR NEIGHBORS (Luke 10:29-37).

    By both His life and His preaching, Christ demonstrated that we are
all connected with one another. "No man is an island." Life as God
would have us live it is community existence, in which neighbors
serve one another without the cramping restrictions of religious, so-
cial, political, or ethnic prejudice.

   What did Jesus intend for us to understand by the term neigh-
bor? Luke 10:29-37.


   How we regard ourselves determines whom we will regard as our
neighbor. "The priest and the Levite thought of themselves, esteemed
themselves, primarily as priest and Levite; and the wounded man was
neither. The Samaritan, however, thought of himself not primarily as a
Samaritan of a certain class, or even as a Samaritan at all, but as a human
being, and therefore to him the important thing was not that a Jew was in
need of help, but that a man was."—Interpreter's Bible, vol. 8, p. 194.

  Would you describe yourself as a Seventh-day Adventist, a
Christian, or simply as a human being concerned about others?
Does how you frame the question make a difference?

  On seeing the wounded Jew, the priest and the Levite seemed to ask,
What will happen to me if I stop and help? The Samaritan, on the other
hand, seemed to ask, What will happen to him if I don't stop and help?
The difference was one of personal orientation—to self or to others.

   "One ship drives east, and another drives west
   With the selfsame winds that flow
   'Tis the set of the sails and not the gales
   Which tells us the way to go."
                             —Ella Wheeler Wilcox, "Winds of Fate"

   What examples can you find that illustrate the negative and
positive outcomes of different, personal orientations? Matt. 25:14-
30; Luke 18:9-14.


   Considering where you live and the people you often meet, what
insights can be gained from the story of the good Samaritan? Are
the acts of "pouring oil" and "binding up the wounds" adequate
and acceptable Christian witness? Can God use those who are not
"in the fold"?

THE CONNECTION (Matt. 11:19).

                 "There is so much good in the worst of us
                 And so much bad in the best of us
                 That it hardly behooves any of us
                 To talk about the rest of us."
                                   —Author unknown

   Through friendship Jesus was the great Connector of people throughout
a wide cross-section of society (Matt. 11:19).

   Research has shown that the longer people are members of the
Adventist faith, the fewer the friends they maintain who have
different or no religious affiliations. Why? Is this tendency some-
thing to resist or to accept as inevitable?


   Whenever individuals with different values, beliefs, and assump-
tions interact with each other, there is a potential for conflict. A
commitment to Christ's value system and lifestyle can create a set of
personal habits and tastes that can be at odds with other sets of habits
and tastes. But Christ's example challenges every Christian to culti-
vate the talent of friendship in spite of the tension that may exist
between individuals with different lifestyles and values. Someone has
observed, "It is not by driving away our brother that we can be alone
with God." There are occasions when the obligation to be courteous in
a social setting brings us in conflict with some facet of our belief
system. "Driving away our brother" is one way to solve this problem
of conflicting obligations—obligation to friendship versus obligation
to uphold a religious belief.

  Develop some guidelines to resolve conflicting obligations. Are
some of these obligations more important than others? Why?
Matt. 12:1-13; 28:19, 20; Micah 6:8.


    "Are there no modern parallels to this disproportion in Pharisaic
 religion? What of the woman deeply concerned for temperance in
 the matter of strong drink, but most intemperate in her prejudices
 and condemnations? What of the businessman who is meticulously
 polite and most regular in church attendance, yet champions glaring
 inequalities in the social structure and drives a hard bargain in
 trade? The chief priests would not put Judas' blood money in the
 treasury because it was unclean (Matthew 27:6), but they paid it that
 Christ might be betrayed!"—Interpreter's Bible, vol. 7, p. 536.

                                                                     99

LINKED BY A COMMON MOTIVE (Matt. 4:18-20).

   What common attraction and common cause united Jesus' dis-
ciples in ministry? Matt. 4:18-20.


   "Jesus satisfied their longings. . . . His eagerness caught their
youth, his certitude their loyalty, his tenderness their love; and some
divine solitude in him called to the deeps of their soul."—Interpreter's
Bible, vol. 7, pp. 276, 277. He, the great Connector, linked their
longing to a great cause.

   What insights can we gain about the commitment involved
following Jesus from these New Testament passages? Matt. 10:34-
37; John 6:1, 2, 25-30, 60-71.


   Following Christ begins with personal choice, but it is maintained
only by the right motive. One does not truly follow Christ if motivated
by personal gain. We are not really linked to each other except as we
find purpose and meaning outside of ourselves in His cause.

  How would you describe Christ's cause? Luke 10:25-28. What
kind of people did Jesus summon to His cause? Mark 3:17-19;
Luke 22:24; Matt. 26:56, 73, 74.


   The great cause that links us together does not instantly rid us of
our human frailty. Individuals who have been blessed with outstand-
ing strengths may also suffer with obvious weaknesses. It is our duty
to understand not only the nature of discipleship, but the nature of the
disciple. God's cause gains nothing by maligning His disciples be-
cause of their imperfections. Our mission, like His, should be to open
wide the gates of acceptance.

   How can we best relate to our children who do not conform to
the beliefs and practices of the church as we taught them? What
approaches are most likely to lead them to further rejection and
alienation? Eph. 6:4; Col. 3:21.


     "Every one of us should weed out of our conversation everything that
 is harsh and severe. We should not indulge in condemning others, and we
 will not do so if we are one with Christ. We are to represent Christ in our
 dealings with our fellowmen."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 225.

INTERPERSONAL CONNECTIONS (Acts 16:23-34).

   Jesus "brought the consciousness of the presence of God not only
on the heights but in the valleys also, . . . not only in those moments
when life soars up on wings but in those other moments when it walks
with lame and weary feet upon a heavy road. . . . Whenever sad people
think of him, something happens to their sadness. They may not
understand it any better; but there is newness in the way they feel.
Their iciness is melted; all that was hard and frozen turns into a stream
of gentle emotion which waters in their souls a garden where flowers
of a fragrant peace begin to grow. They are not afraid of sadness now,
for the love of God is walking by their side."—Interpreter's Bible,
vol. 8, p. 91.
    Jesus is the great Connector through His healing power. That heal-
ing may be a dramatic restoration of physical health, or it may be a
healing attitudinal change. He connects us intrapersonally so that we
are at peace with our inner selves. We experience the peace that passes
all understanding through His healing power.

  Think of examples from the Bible and life that demonstrate
Christ's healing. Acts 16:23-34; John 14:27.


   Through the ministry of healing, Christ also connects us interper-
sonally. Through our ministry of healing, we build bonds of friend-
ship, love, and trust. Typical of this bonding is the letter written by the
spouse of a cancer patient at an Adventist hospital:
   I could write you all a long and ongoing letter in an attempt to
   give my thanks to you for your love and caring of my wife,
   Donna. But in turn I will only say you all are a part of me now. I
   love all of you as Donna loved you all. The first time Donna was
   able to leave the hospital, she cried while leaving, and I asked,
   "Honey, what is it?" Donna stated, "I hate to leave, I love them
   all so much." I told her you all would always be a part of our
   lives. I love you, I love you all for being who you are and for
   loving Donna the way she deserved to be loved. Enclosed is a
   poem Donna wrote at age 15 years. I hope and pray you all will
   make a copy and keep it always in your hearts as she deserves so
   much more than she got, and yet now is free from her pain.
   Donna was a champion and always will be. God Bless.

FURTHER STUDY: By reviewing the story in John 8:3-11, meditate
on Jesus as the great Connector through compassion and understand-
ing.

   Jesus' life and ministry challenged the popular thinking of the day
and encouraged men and women to be more connected with one
another by being more compassionate and forgiving. Compassion and
understanding must not be limited to offering forgiveness when we
are wronged. For the Christian, it must include building relationships.
   "All who receive the life of Christ are ordained to work for the
salvation of their fellow men. For this work the church was estab-
lished, and all who take upon themselves its sacred vows are thereby
pledged to be co-workers with Christ. . . .
   "Ministry does not consist alone in preaching. Those minister who
relieve the sick and suffering, helping the needy, speaking words of
comfort to the despondent and those of little faith. Nigh and afar off
are souls weighed down by a sense of guilt. It is not hardship, toil or
poverty that degrades humanity. It is guilt, wrong-doing. This brings
unrest and dissatisfaction. Christ would have His servants minister to
sin-sick souls."—The Desire of Ages, p. 822.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What examples of compassion and understanding do we find
     in Christ's ministry? (See Luke 7:36-39; Mark 10:13, 14;
     John 3:1-5.)

   2. As you reflect on your own life, identify some experiences in
      which compassion and understanding helped to build last-
      ing relationships.

   3. Are there some realistic limits to compassion, understanding,
      and forgiveness? What guidelines can you formulate from
      Christ's teachings? (See Matt. 25:34, 41; John 2:13-16.)

SUMMARY: During the course of this week, we have studied the life
of Christ as the Great Connector. He is the Great Connector:

                  through incarnation—what He became,
                  through precept—what He teaches,
                  through friendship—how He relates,
                  through invitation—what He says,
                  through healing—what He does,
                  through compassion—what He is.

                         Healing the Wounds of Hate
   VtaF7
                                Charlotte Ishkanian

         It seemed to Daniel Vitkovic that everyone in the former repub-
      lics of Yugoslavia hated anyone who was not of the same nation-
      ality or religion. He was tired of the hating, especially over reli-
      gion. He wasn't even sure there was a God.
          Then Daniel heard a radio report about ADRA, an organization
      that was helping people on all sides of the war in the former
      Yugoslavia: the Serbs, the Croats, and the Muslims, without tak-
      ing sides. Daniel was impressed that anyone could love everyone
      the same. At the end of the story, the announcer said that ADRA
      was sponsored by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Daniel was
      impressed. Here was true Christianity.
          One regular radio program featured interviews with leaders of
      various churches. Most leaders attacked one another and accused
      others of following false doctrines. But one pastor refused to
      attack other denominations. Instead he answered the questions
      given him with verses from the Bible. Daniel recognized the
      church's name: Seventh-day Adventist.
          Daniel was not inherently religious; he wasn't even convinced
      that there was a God. But if there was, he felt that Adventists must
      really know Him. After hearing an Adventist scientist defend
      creationism, Daniel decided he wanted to know more about this
      church.
          Daniel telephoned the local Adventist church and asked about
      two books that had been offered on the radio. When the pastor
      delivered the books, Daniel signed up for the Bible correspon-
      dence course. The pastor invited him to attend church the next
       Sabbath, and Daniel agreed. He found that the people loved one
       another regardless of their race. He was baptized in April 1996.
          Daniel was not looking for God, but God found him. He did not
       know that the emptiness in his life was a hunger for God. Before he
                               met Adventists, he had not seen anything in
                               religion that interested him. So what attracted
                               him to the Adventist Church?
                                   "When everyone else was hating," Daniel
                               said, "ADRA and the Adventists showed
                               love." Daniel wants to show that love to
                               others. Perhaps this way he can help heal
                               the wounds that hatred has caused.

                                 accounting in Podorica, Montenegro.

          Eternal Restoration




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Isa. 65:8, 9, 17, 21-25; 66:22, 23;
1 John 5:11-13; Rev. 21:1-5; 22:17.

  MEMORY TEXT: "And God shall wipe away all tears from
  their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow,
  nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former
  things are passed away" (Revelation 21:4).

    KEY THOUGHT: Both Old and New Testament scriptures give
us great comfort in their description of the restoration of this earth to
its original perfection. Immortality and freedom from disease will
give joy to all who inhabit the new earth. What hope to all who suffer
in this present life!

   THROUGH CHRIST'S PROMISES WE HAVE UNENDING
HOPE. It was the promise of Christ's return that sustained the dis-
ciples in the first century. It was the promise of Christ's return that
sustained the Advent believers in the 1840s. They misunderstood the
event that was to take place in 1844, but they loved Jesus and contin-
ued to believe His promises.
   On William Miller's farm in New York state, a chapel still stands,
and over the pulpit are the words from the book of Daniel, "At the
time appointed the end shall be." While we do not know the day of
Jesus' return, we have absolute confidence that He will return "at the
time appointed," and then He will restore the perfection of the Garden
of Eden in our re-created world.

THE PROMISE OF ETERNAL RESTORATION (Isa. 25:8, 9).

   Promises of the restoration of righteousness and perfection to the
earth are found in Old and New Testament alike. This chain of prom-
ises runs through the Bible like a golden thread. But the promise of a
time when there will be no more pain or death has been a special
comfort to all because in this world of sin there is no "permanent"
family circle; inevitably it is a broken circle.

  What hope did Jesus give Martha at the grave of her brother
Lazarus? How did Martha respond? John 11:24-27.


   "Had Christ been in the sickroom, Lazarus would not have died; for
Satan would have had no power over him. Death could not have aimed
his dart at Lazarus in the presence of the Life-giver. Therefore Christ
remained away. He suffered the enemy to exercise his power, that He
might drive him back, a conquered foe."—The Desire of Ages, p. 528.

   Why cannot humanity in its present condition inherit God's
kingdom of glory? By what change will Jesus make possible that
inheritance? 1 Cor. 15:50-57.


   Peter Marshall, an immigrant to America from Scotland, knew that
God had called him to the ministry. His keen insights into life and
spirituality made him a sought-after speaker, and the pews of his
Washington, D.C., church were always filled. A selection of some of
his memorable sermons was published under the title Mr. Jones Meet
the Master, and the story of his life became a popular film. He became
the chaplain to the U.S. Senate, and his poignant prayers were pub-
lished in the Washington press.
   Soon after this appointment to the Senate, Peter suffered a heart
attack and later a second heart attack that ended his life. As he left his
home by ambulance after the second attack, he whispered to his wife,
Catherine, "I'll see you, darling, I'll see you in the morning."
   Goodbyes are never easy, and the goodbyes at death are the most
crushing of all. But when you know your Jesus has passed through the
dark valley, and the resurrection on that soon-to-dawn morning is as
certain as tomorrow's sunrise, even the pain of death can lose a little
of its sting.

     In what ways can the hope of the resurrection influence daily
 life at home and at work?


                                                                     105
Monday                                             December 22
THE SOURCE OF RESTORATION (1 John 5:11-13).

   Jesus is the source of all life on our planet because He was the active
agent in Creation. The New Testament identifies Jesus as the One who
spoke the words that brought all creation into existence. The Psalms
record that "He spoke, and it came to be; he commanded, and it stood
firm" (Ps. 33:9, NIV), and the New Testament writers expanded on these
words to identify Jesus as the One who spoke. For example, John wrote:
"He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the
world did not recognize him" (John 1:10, NIV, italics supplied).
   And the One who created will re-create and restore this shattered
world into a condition that we, in our sinful condition, cannot even
imagine. Quoting from Isaiah 64:4, Paul exclaimed, "Eye hath not seen,
nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things
which God hath prepared for them that love him" (1 Cor. 2:9, KJV).

  When does eternal life begin for the believer? 1 John 5:11, 12;
John 1:12; 3:36; 5:24.


   While the gift of immortality is given at the second coming of Christ
(1 Cor. 15:53), eternal life begins when we accept Christ into our hearts.
When we are born again, the mind is renewed, and we become new
creatures. We receive the gift the moment we receive Him, for He is
eternal life. Thus, to have Jesus as Saviour is to have eternal life.

  What did Jesus mean when He declared Himself to be the
Bread of Life? John 6:48-51.


   The Creator is also the Sustainer. John 6 has Jesus three times
repeat the truth that He is the Bread of Life. These statements occurred
in a sermon preached the day after Jesus fed 5,000 of His hungry
listeners. The story of the previous day spotlights the lad whose
mother probably had the forethought to provide for her son and the
young man's readiness to give his nourishing lunch to Jesus (John 6:8,
9). That lunch became a banquet for a large crowd. But baskets of
food remained after the crowd was filled and satisfied. "Filled and
satisfied" are words that accurately describe our condition when we
find Jesus as our Bread of Life.

    What are the practical means by which we can experience
 Jesus as the One who fills and satisfies? How can we help others
 to partake of the Bread of Life?

THE RESTORATION OF HUMANITY (Rev. 21:1-4).

   It is the descent of the city that sets the stage for the climax of God's
plan to restore earth to Edenic perfection. "As the ransomed ones are
welcomed to the City of God, there rings out upon the air an exultant cry
of adoration. The two Adams are about to meet. The Son of God is
standing with outstretched arms to receive the father of our race—the
being whom He created, who sinned against his Maker, and for whose
sin the marks of the crucifixion are borne upon the Saviour's form. As
Adam discerns the prints of the cruel nails, he does not fall upon the
bosom of the Lord, but in humiliation casts himself at His feet, crying:
`Worthy, worthy is the Lamb that was slain!' Tenderly the Saviour lifts
him up and bids him look once more upon the Eden home from which he
has so long been exiled. . . . Transported with joy, he beholds the trees
that were once his delight—the very trees whose fruit he himself had
gathered in the days of his innocence and joy. He sees the vines that his
own hands have trained, the very flowers that he once loved to care
for. . . . The Saviour leads him to the tree of life and plucks the glorious
fruit and bids him eat."—The Great Controversy, pp. 647, 648.

   In the picture of the New Jerusalem returning to earth after
1000 years in heaven, the followers of Christ are likened to a bride
(Rev. 21:2). What is the most important feature of the bride? Rev.
19: 7, 8.


   Christ's justified, sanctified people, at the conclusion of the pre-
Advent judgment (Rev. 19:2), are depicted as clothed in "fine linen,
bright and clean" (Rev. 19:8, NIV). As spiritual overcomers through the
power of Jesus Christ, they are clothed for eternity with His right-
eousness; their works demonstrate Christ's mastery of their lives, and
their names are retained in the book of life (Rev. 3:5). The robe of
righteousness they wear represents "the righteous deeds of the saints"
(Rev. 19:8, RSV). Righteous deeds are performed only by those who
have received the gift of Christ's righteousness (1 John 2:29). Right-
eous deeds demonstrate that Christ's righteousness rules in their lives (1
John 3:7).

    Our ministry to others involves "the righteous acts of saints,"
 but never to merit salvation, only as evidence of its accom-
 plished fact. The Olivet sermon climaxes with Jesus' dividing
 the sheep and the goats on the evidence of a ministry of service
 to others or the lack of it (Matt. 25:31-46).



                                                                       107
Wednesday                                             December 24
THE RESTORATION OF THE EARTH (Isa. 65:17).

   Our earth is in desperate need of renewal. The apostle Paul ob-
served, "The whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together
until now" (Rom. 8:22, KJV). Remarkably, there are still numberless
areas of exquisite beauty in nature, despite the desolation of the earth
by past natural disasters, including Noah's flood and contemporary
desolation caused by such upheavals as earthquakes.

   What should be the attitude of Christians toward the preserva-
tion of nature? Does the fact of its promised restoration have an
influence on our relationship to its protection and preservation
now? Why?


  How complete will be the renewal of the earth? Isa. 65:17; 2
Peter 3:11-13.


   Of what realities can we be certain in the new earth? Isa. 65:17,
21, 22; 66:22, 23; Rev. 21:4.


   It is almost impossible to visualize a world in which there is no
disease or death, no sorrow or crying, no pain or suffering. It is also
difficult to comprehend a real earth with real people who will recog-
nize one another, but with no suffering or handicapped person. The
bloom of health will be seen on every cheek. The joy of living will be
evident on every face. There will be real work, real homes, and real
beauty to gladden all those who are there.

   How can we best focus on a new earth and be good stewards of
this earth?


    "Human language is inadequate to describe the reward of the
 righteous. It will be known only to those who behold it. No finite mind
 can comprehend the glory of the Paradise of God. In the Bible the
 inheritance of the saved is called 'a country.' There the heavenly
 Shepherd leads His flock to fountains of living waters. The tree of life
 yields its fruit every month, and the leaves of the tree are for the service
 of the nations. There are ever-flowing streams, clear as crystal, and
 beside them waving trees cast their shadows upon the paths prepared
 for the ransomed of the Lord. . . . God's people, so long pilgrims and
 wanderers, shall find a home."—The Great Controversy, p. 675.

Thursday                                            December 25
THE ASSURANCE OF RESTORATION (Rev. 22:17).

   The invitation to be part of God's eternal kingdom is extended to
everyone. "Whosoever will" may come. Jesus invites everyone born
into this world to come to Him and be saved and thus be prepared to
enter the New Jerusalem and the New Earth.

   How did Jesus express to Nicodemus the conditions for eternal
restoration? John 3:5.


   Experiencing the new birth comes when an individual kneels at the
foot of the cross in repentance and receives forgiveness. This was
what Peter referred to when he said to the people at the temple,
"Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted
out" (Acts 3:19). This experience is sometimes described by the meta-
phor of washing our clothes in the blood of the Lamb (Rev. 7:14;
12:11; 19:7, 8). The "blood of the Lamb" refers to Christ's death on
the cross, where He took our sins and died as our substitute.
   "As the sinner, drawn by the power of Christ, approaches the
uplifted cross, and prostrates himself before it, there is a new creation.
A new heart is given him. He becomes a new creature in Christ Jesus.
Holiness finds that it has nothing more to require. God Himself is 'the
justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.' Rom. 3:26. And 'whom He
justified, them he also glorified.' Rom. 8:30."—Christ's Object Les-
sons, p. 163.

  What word of blessing is given to those who enter the New
Jerusalem as their final home? Rev. 21:6, 7.


   It is Christ who gives life and offers the power to help us choose not to
sin. In relationship with Him, we maintain the assurance of eternal life.
Each day we can grow closer to Jesus and become more and more like
Him. The pearly gates of the New Jerusalem will open wide to those who
walk daily with Jesus in such repentance and obedience.

   How can we maintain this assurance on a daily basis? John
15:3-11. What part do prayer, Bible study, and witnessing have to
play? Why? Try to be very specific.


    "There, immortal minds will contemplate with never-failing
 delight the wonders of creative power, the mysteries of redeem-
 ing love."—The Great Controversy, p. 677.

                                                                       109
Friday                                            December 26
FURTHER STUDY: Read Isaiah, chapters 65 and 66; Revelation,
chapters 19-22; "The Controversy Ended," The Great Controversy,
chapter 42.

   "This earth is the place of preparation for heaven. The time spent
here is the Christian's winter. Here the chilly winds of affliction blow
upon us, and the waves of trouble roll against us. But in the near
future, when Christ comes, sorrow and sighing will be forever ended.
Then will be the Christian's summer. All trials will be over, and there
will be no more sickness or death."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 988.
   "The controversy is ended. Sin and sinners are no more. The entire
universe is clean. One pulse of harmony and gladness beats through
the vast creation. From Him who created all, flow life and light and
gladness, throughout the realms of illimitable space. From the minut-
est atom to the greatest world, all things, animate and inanimate, in
their unshadowed beauty and perfect joy, declare that God is love."—
The Great Controversy, p. 678.
   As the delegates at the 1995 General Conference session in Hol-
land sang so enthusiastically:

         "We have this hope that burns within our hearts.
         Hope in the coming of the Lord.
         We have this faith that Christ alone imparts,
         Faith in the promise of His Word.
         We believe the time is here,
         When the nations far and near
         Shall awake, and shout, and sing
         Hallelujah! Christ is king!
         We have this hope that burns within our hearts,
         Hope in the coming of the Lord."
                           —Wayne Hooper

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How can we make the reality of Jesus' coming, of heaven,
     and of the new earth a part of daily living?

   2. What can we do to help our families, particularly our chil-
      dren and youth, to want to be in the New Earth?

   3. What does eternal restoration mean to you personally?

SUMMARY: The followers of Christ will show compassion and love
for the afflicted, sorrowing, and ill whom they meet from day to day.
They are ever motivated by "the blessed hope" of His soon return.

0107            20-Something Youth Ministry Wins Teen
                             Beverly Herbrandson Koester

            Priscilla O'Dala is a bright, outgoing 19-year-old from Blantyre,
         Malawi. Her love of people drew her into an Adventist youth
         ministry that has changed her life.
            "I knew a little about Adventists because one person out of
         every 60 in Malawi is a baptized Seventh-day Adventist. But I
         was never really interested in what they believe. My family
         studies the Bible together, and when we found the Sabbath
         commandment, we agreed that the seventh day was the Sab-
         bath. But our family worshiped on Sunday. I asked God to lead
         me into the right religion.
            "One day an Adventist friend invited me to a 20-Something
         Youth-Club meeting. The club is not just social; it has all-day
         meetings one Sabbath a month. We worship, study the Bible,
         enjoy fellowship, and share outreach. It is a great chance for
         young people to make new friends in a comfortable, safe,
         Christian environment. We usually have around 50 young people
         at the gatherings, and always we have visitors.
             "The 20-Something members made me feel so welcome, I
         was eager to go back. The youth sang as though they really
         meant what they were singing, and they prayed before doing
         nearly anything. That really impressed me. Now I pray about
         everything I do.
             "The 20-Something Club drew me into regular church atten-
         dance. Then I began staying after church to watch a video
         Bible study. I took notes then studied the texts later. The
         presentation on the Sabbath really impressed me, since it rein-
         forced everything I had been reading. The Bible-class teacher
         answered my questions and invited me to be baptized. I knew it
         was God's call to me. I was baptized on 20-Something Sabbath
                                     when all my new friends could be
                                     present.
                                        "I'm thrilled that now my father and
                                     sister have joined the baptismal class. I
                                     thank God through His Son, Jesus Christ,
                                     for giving me this wonderful life."
