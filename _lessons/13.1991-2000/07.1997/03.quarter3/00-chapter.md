                   Parables of Jesus
                  Stories of Love and Grace
   "Tell me a story!" is a request not often denied. And, "Do you
want to hear a story?" is a question not often answered with, "Well,
no, not really." Good stories reach beyond culture, gender, age, and
race. And good storytellers can inspire the hardest of hearts.
   So it is with Jesus and the parables He told nearly 2,000 years ago.
As we study some of these parables this quarter, it will be good to
remember the following:
   1.Generally speaking, a parable reflects truth; it is not truth itself.
Sometimes a parable is a true story that illustrates important aspects
of truth. (See the comment on the parable of the Good Samaritan in
The Desire of Ages, p. 499.)
   2. The context of the parable—where, when, and to whom Jesus
told the parable—is the key to its interpretation.
   3. A parable usually deals with one facet of truth. The details of
the parable are important as they shed light on that truth.
   4. Understanding Oriental customs and thought processes evident
in the parable help you to understand the meaning of the parable.
    There are many ways to organize a study of the parables. This
quarterly will help you study them from the viewpoint of the
Christian journey. Such a journey can be outlined as follows:

                                           Home at last
                                    VI     Lesson 13

                            Aids and hindrances along the way
                    IV      Lessons 6 and 7
                    His grace changes the direction of lives

       II   Lessons 2 and 3

   So come along! And as you travel, may the Master Storyteller
inspire you to walk with enthusiasm, joy, and total commitment to
His will. His love inspires such commitment—His love reigning in
your heart because of the constant presence of the Holy Spirit.

                                                                        5

           The Lost and Found




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Luke 15.

     MEMORY TEXT: "The Sovereign Lord says: 'I myself will
     search for my sheep and look after them. ... I will rescue them
     from all the places where they were scattered on a day of clouds
     and darkness' " (Ezekiel 34:11, 12, NIV).

  KEY THOUGHT: Salvation begins with God's love and mercy. It
comes not as much through our searching for God as it comes through
God's searching for us.

   WHICH ONE OF US has not experienced frustration over the loss
of some thing, then expressed joy at finding it? Thus we are drawn
into Luke 15. Studied together, the stories in this chapter paint a mini-
picture of Jesus' ministry. Indeed, the entire chapter glows with His
love and grace. It begins as Jesus is sharing a meal with tax collectors
and sinners. (The Pharisees considered anyone a sinner who did not
live according to their principles.) The word receiveth (Luke 15:2,
KJV) or welcomes (NIV) implies that Jesus was the host. Because
eating with someone symbolized acceptance (Acts 11:3; 1 Cor. 5:11),
the Pharisees and scribes viewed Jesus as an irreligious man.
   Jesus further displays His love and grace through the parables He
tells. In the first two we will study, He compares God to a shepherd
and a woman, people from two groups in His society who had no civil
rights and whom the Pharisees disdained. In the third parable, He
describes a father's compassionate behavior toward a son who does
things no proper Jewish son would ever do.
    Jesus invites you to feast with Him, to experience His love and mercy.

THE LOST SHEEP (Luke 15:1-7).

   The differences between Christ's behavior toward sinners and
the Pharisees' behavior force us to ask, "What is God really like?"
Luke 15:1, 2. How does Jesus personalize His storytelling to help
us find the answer? Luke 15:3-6.


   The questions with which Jesus begins not only relate to experi-
ences we all have had but force us to evaluate our own response to this
particular situation. "The Lord knew that because of the value of what
had been lost any of these hearers would have left the ninety-nine to
go seek the lost sheep. The search would not have been casual or of
short duration; rather, it would have been diligent and would have
extended until the valuable lost sheep was found. The search would
have been initiated and pursued because of the value placed on what
the owner had lost."—J. Dwight Pentecost, The Parables of Jesus
(Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan Publishing House, 1982), p. 100.
The intrinsic value of the sheep was not the major issue, but the value
placed upon it by its loving master. Our divine Shepherd's love for us,
the creation of His hand, gives us value beyond the possibility of
human computation.

  What is the main point of the parable? Verse 7. What does the
parable teach about repentance? Does verse 7 mean there are
some people who do not have to repent?


   The Jews believed that before God could be merciful to the sinner,
the sinner first must repent. This is probably one reason why the
scribes and Pharisees muttered about the company Jesus was keeping.
They thought He should associate only with those who had repented.
But this parable teaches us that "we do not repent in order that God
may love us, but He reveals to us His love in order that we may
repent."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 189.
    When a sheep is lost, it most likely will lie down helplessly. It will
not even stand or run. Thus, when the shepherd finds it, he must carry
it home. So it is with us. Sin renders us helpless. But Christ searches
for us and restores us to His fold.
    The lost sheep symbolizes not only an individual sinner, but the one
world that went astray among the vast creations of God. Giving up the
glory of heaven, Christ came to restore this world to its former sinless state.

   Relate Ezekiel 34:1-14 to the parable of the lost sheep. What
 do these verses teach us about God?

                                                                            7
Monday                                                        June 30
THE LOST COIN (Luke 15:8-11).

   Jesus continued to show the muttering scribes and Pharisees why
He ate with sinners, by telling another parable similar to that of the
lost sheep. The lost coin could have been part of the dowry the woman
received at her wedding. Brides usually placed such coins in a headband
they wore on their forehead for all to see. "The coins not only had a
monetary value but an emotional value as well, for they signified the
bond between the bride and the bridegroom."—Pentecost, The Parables
of Jesus, p. 101.
   The woman's home was probably windowless and had a dirt or
stone floor covered with straw to alleviate dust, cold, and dampness.
To look for the coin, she would have to light a lamp, remove the straw,
and sift through it. But the value of the coin was worth the effort.

   Summarize the meaning of the parable. What does the value of
this one coin teach us about the value of one sinner who repents?
Compare Matt. 26:33-35; Luke 22:54-62; John 21:15-17. Jesus
uses a woman to illustrate God. What image of God does this
portray?


   We yearn to spread the gospel throughout the lost world. And
indeed we should. Jesus even commanded us to do so (Matt. 28:18-20).
But do we sometimes obey this command at the expense of our families?
Do we show the same concern for an individual family member as we
do the world at large? The coin, like a family member, was near at
hand. Yet it was still lost at home.
   "The woman . . . searches diligently for her lost coin. . . . So in the
family if one member is lost to God every means should be used for
his recovery. On the part of all the others let there be diligent, careful
self-examination. Let the life-practice be investigated. See if there is
not some mistake, some error in management, by which that soul is
confirmed in impenitence.
   "If there is in the family one child who is unconscious of his sinful
state, parents should not rest. Let the candle be lighted. Search the word of
God, and by its light let everything in the home be diligently examined, to
see why this child is lost."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 194.

    Does the lost coin symbolize any member of your family, or
 perhaps you yourself? (Consider also your work family, church
 family, etc.) How can you diligently search for that one? Con-
 sider the possibility that perhaps it was something you said or
 did that prevents this person from being found.

THE YOUNGER SON (Luke 15:11-20).

   The Luke 15 parables share a definite progression. The sheep
knew it was lost, just as some people realize they are separated
from God. The coin did not know it was lost, symbolizing people
who do not realize they need salvation. What type of person does
the younger son portray? Luke 15:13, 14.


   These parables also trace a progression of God's love. First, we
witness God's measureless compassion. For the sake of the lost, He
searches far into the wilderness of sin until His search is successful.
From the coin we learn of the value God places on even one sinner.
And as we watch the drama unfold in the last parable, we see that
God's compassion and the value He places on us are established in the
parent-child relationship. God is my father; I am His child.
   Even though the younger son came from a rich family, he was
restless to seek his fortune. Palestine itself was a poor country where
famine and foreign troops often invaded. Perhaps reports from the
Jews outside Palestine appealed to the son's dissatisfaction with things
as they were at home. Thus he had the audacity to insult his father by
asking for what would become his only at his father's death.

  At what point during his independence did the younger son
come to his senses? Luke 15:14-17.


  "Joined himself." The Greek word means "to glue together." In
desperation, the younger son basically sold himself to someone who
could only offer him a job no self-respecting Jew would accept. A
Jewish curse stated, "Cursed be the man who keeps swine." Doing so
meant that he would be in contact with unclean animals (Lev. 11:7, 8).
  "Such is life in the 'far country.' Distance from God means waste,
want, degradation. Its full and final outworking may take time, or it
may hasten with terrible rapidity. But it comes sooner or later."
—The Pulpit Commentary, The Gospel According to Luke, vol. 2, p. 54.

    "When he came to himself" (Luke 15:17) illustrates
 repentance. How can we reconcile the younger son's repentance
 with the lesson that "we do not repent in order that
 God may love us, but He reveals to us His love in order that we
 may repent."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 189. Think about the
 true nature of repentance and the role it plays in your life.



                                                                      9

THE WAITING FATHER (Luke 15:20-24).

   How do we know the father was concerned about and waiting
for his younger son? Luke 15:20.


    "It was undignified for an old man to break stride and run, but this
father discarded dignity. . . . Before the first word of explanation, he
flung his arms around his boy's neck and kissed him. In the Old
Testament, members of a family commonly kissed one another,
including a man kissing his son (2 Sam. 14:33); and an embrace was a
classic expression of reunion (Gen. 29:11, 13; 33:4; 45:14)."
—Peter Rhea Jones, The Teaching of the Parables (Nashville, Ten-
nessee: Broadman Press, 1982), p. 177. The father's joy was so great,
it excluded any judgmental spirit. How his actions must have shocked
the scribes and Pharisees listening to Jesus. They would have nodded
their heads with satisfaction if the father had required repentance and
proof of change before accepting his son back into the household. Yet
once again, Jesus illustrates the nature of His salvation through the
father's wholehearted acceptance of his son.

   What in particular signaled the prodigal's return, not as a
servant, but as the father's child? Luke 15:22-24.


   Because he had asked for his inheritence before it was due him, the
son knew he had no right to any more of his father's goods. And
because he was aware that his request showed more concern for his
father's property than for his father himself, he knew that the father
had every right to reject him. Yet he knew that he would be no worse
off if he were to become one of his father's servants. But he never got
the chance to suggest it. Instead, his father hurried to give him the best
robe, which only honored guests received. Upon his finger, the father
placed what was most likely a signet ring that only those with authority
received (Gen. 41:42; Esther 8:2). And upon his feet the father placed
sandals, which only free men enjoyed.

  Explain how the father's behavior confirms the role of repent-
ance in the plan of salvation as taught by the first two parables.


    How do you treat people who have left the church but later
 express a desire to reenter? Do you display the same love and
 affection as the father?

THE OLDER SON (Luke 15:25-32).

   The lost lamb, lost coin, and lost son represent people who have
not accepted salvation. The shepherd, woman, and father repre-
sent God and His salvation. Whom does the older brother repre-
sent? Luke 15:25-28.


     The older brother's resentment is like the attitude of the scribes
and Pharisees. "To them Jesus says: 'Behold the greatness of God's
love for his lost children, and contrast it with your own joyless,
loveless, thankless and self-righteous lives. Cease then from your
loveless ways, and be merciful. The spiritually dead are rising to new
life, the lost are returning home, rejoice with him.' "—Joachim Jeremias,
The Parables of Jesus (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1972),
p. 131.
    "The elder brother is very unpopular—in the parable. He is not
unpopular in society, and he has many descendants. He is sometimes
an officer in the church, a leader in reform groups, a 'key citizen.' He
thinks, or wills to think, that all other races are 'inferior.' A man out of
work is simply unemployable. . . . A prodigal like the younger son is
just a wastrel. . . . Any neighbor of progressive mind is to him
`a dangerous element in the community.' . . . Friedrich W. Krummacher
has an honest and penetrating comment. A questioner asked his
opinion of the identity of the elder brother. He replied: 'I learned it
only yesterday . . . myself.' "—The Intrepreter's Bible, vol. 8, p. 279.

  What may we imply about the religion of the scribes and
Pharisees from the words of the older brother in Luke 15:29, 30?


   The elder brother's attitude separated him from God just as much
as did his brother's prodigal lifestyle. How this attitude exposes the
Pharisaic spirit that often passes for religion! But the older brother and
Pharisees were not hopeless. The father's words to his firstborn (Jesus'
words to the Pharisees) in verses 31, 32, are in essence an invitation to
enter into the joy of salvation.

   Because Jesus wanted the parable to require a response from
 His listeners, He left it unfinished. We are not sure whether the
 prodigal remains within the bosom of his father's love. Neither
 do we know whether the older brother decides to join the
 celebration. Thus, we, the audience, must determine the
 outcome. Are you the older brother? The younger brother? How
 will you write the rest of the story?

                                                                        11

FURTHER STUDY: Echoes of the parables in Luke 15 resound
through the New Testament. Read Matthew 10:5-8; Acts 1:8; Romans
6:11-13; Galatians 4:7; Ephesians 2:1-22. Also review Psalm 23.

  Read the following chapters in Christ's Object Lessons, "This
Man Receiveth Sinners," pp. 185-197; "Lost and Is Found,"
pp. 198-211.

   "The love of God still yearns over the one who has chosen to
separate from Him, and He sets in operation influences to bring him
back to the Father's house. . . . Miserable as he was, the prodigal
found hope in the conviction of his father's love. It was that love
which was drawing him toward home. So it is the assurance of God's
love that constrains the sinner to return to God."—Christ's Object
Lessons, p. 202.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. The setting of the three parables studied this week was a
     fellowship meal. How is this meal a parable in itself? (See
     Ezek. 34:23-31; Micah 5:2-4; Isa. 25:6-12; 49:8-13; Rev.
     19:9.) What types of people might sit with Jesus today at
     such a meal?

   2. The parables in Luke 15 teach us that God freely extends
      His mercy to sinners. What is the need then for the cross? In
      the last parable, where might we observe the element of the
      cross (sacrifice)? (See Phil. 2:7, 8; Heb. 12:2.) How does
      what Jesus did on the cross compare to the father's actions?

  3. After studying this week's lesson, how would you answer
     the question "What is God really like?"

      . What element appears in all three parables? (See Luke
        15: 7, 10, 24, 32.) What does this element teach us about
        God's character?

  5. With which of the following do you identify most? The lost
     sheep? The lost coin? The younger brother? The older
     brother? Why?

SUMMARY: Yes, Pharisees and scribes, Jesus welcomes sinners and
eats with them. And that is the beginning, indeed the essence, of the
gospel. Unwittingly, what was meant to be derogatory actually proved
to be complimentary. A murmur against Him instead declared the
truth: Salvation begins with Christ and His grace.

                       A Little Kindness
                           Leonard Atkins

   Sister E. G. Malopa is a pastor's wife and Bible worker in Central
Malawi. She has heard God's call for laborers to go and seek the lost,
and she loves to find people who will listen to the call of Christ.
   One day while visiting door-to-door, she met a family of seven
people. She introduced her reason for visiting by reading John 3:16,
"For God so loved the world. . . ." In the corner of the room, the
family's grandfather lay on a bed, paralyzed. As Sister Malopa spoke
about Christ, the grandfather began to ask questions about God and
Christianity. Then he told her that he was discouraged and convinced
that God had forgotten about him. She listened as he told his story.
   Twelve years earlier he had gone into the bush to cut some
trees for the house he was building. One tree fell on him and
broke his back. He could not move, so his friends carried him
back to his home. For 12 years he had lain on his bed, totally
dependent on his family for all his needs. During all this time, no
one had come to visit or offer him encouragement.
   With tears in his eyes, he told Sister Malopa, "you are the first one
who has spoken words of hope and courage to me in all these difficult
years of my disability." Sister Malopa spent considerable time visit-
ing with the family, offering words of hope and promises of God's
loving care. Before she left that day, the grandfather told Sister
Malopa, "Because of your kindness, today I choose Jesus to be my
Saviour. Write my name and my wife's name in your Bible-class
record book." The entire family joined their grandfather in requesting
that their names be included in the Bible-class register.
   Sister Malopa left that home rejoicing in God's goodness. She
immediately reported her experience to the local Adventist church.
The pastor organized a group to go regularly to pray with this
family. They have organized a Branch Sabbath School near the
village of these people so that they can fellowship with other
Christians every Sabbath.
    Sister Malopa has heard God's call for men and women who
will go and search out every home where souls are longing to
hear of God's love. She has answered the call to make herself
available to God to witness and care for lost and longing souls,
 not just because that is her employment, but because God's voice
 has said, "Who shall go for us?" And, like Isaiah, she has an-
 swered, "Here am I, Lord. Send me."

  Elder Leonard Atkins is the chaplain at Blantyre (Malawi)
Adventist Hospital and pastors a church in Blantyre, as well.

      Claiming the Treasure




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 13:44-46; Luke
7:36-50; 12:13-34; 14:25-35.

   MEMORY TEXT: "Where your treasure is, there will your
   heart be also" (Luke 12:34).

   KEY THOUGHT: The Father's love and grace compels Him to
search for us. And once He finds us, the same grace offers to restore
us to our original position as His children. How we respond to His
offer determines the course of our lives.

    THE PEARL OF ASIA was discovered by Persian divers in 1628.
Drop-shaped, three inches long, and approximately two inches thick,
it is the largest natural seed pearl in existence. Grave robbers stole the
pearl from the tomb of Ch'ien Lung, Manchu emperor of China, in
1799, one hundred years after his death. The whereabouts of the pearl
remained a mystery until it resurfaced 18 years later in Hong Kong as
security for a large loan that eventually defaulted. After that, an
unidentified buyer from Paris bought the pearl for an unknown price.
    Two thousand years ago, Jesus told a story about another merchant
who purchased a pearl of great price. This story and others that Jesus
told help us to take the next step in our understanding of salvation. It
is true that Jesus' loving grace seeks us out while we are yet sinners. It
is equally true that His finding us requires us to respond to His love.
    The parables we will study for the next two weeks deal with the
value of truth, the effort necessary to secure it, various ways of
receiving the truth, and things that might prevent us from accepting it.

THE PERFECT PEARL (Matt. 13:45, 46).

   The Greek word for "merchant" refers to a wholesale dealer, as
opposed to a retailer or tradesperson. Merchants were highly
respected, and some priests even engaged in the profession.
   "In the ancient world pearls had a very special place in men's
hearts. People desired to possess a lovely pearl, not only for its money
value, but for its beauty. They found a pleasure in simply handling it
and contemplating it. . . . The main sources of pearls in those days were
the shores off the Red Sea and far-off Britain itself; but a merchant
would scour the markets of the world to find a pearl which was of
surpassing beauty."—William Barclay, The Gospel of Matthew (Phila-
delphia, Pa.: The Westminster Press, 1975), vol. 2, pp. 86, 87.

   The pearl was costly because it was perfect in every way. With
this in mind, whom does the pearl symbolize? Col. 2:3; 1 Cor.
1:30; Eph. 3:8.


   Describe the merchant's behavior when he found the pearl.
Matt. 13:46. What does his behavior tell us about the pearl's
value? Does his behavior suggest we must somehow purchase
salvation?


   This parable represents people who search diligently for their
Saviour. This Saviour is worth all any person has, just as the pearl was
worth all to the merchant. But if there is nothing we can do to purchase
salvation (Rom. 3:21-28), why must we be willing to relinquish all to
gain it? Because what we own often owns us. Because possessions may
control our lives, something that only God should do (Matt. 19:16-
26). But deeper yet, salvation costs the price of pride, personal aspira-
tions, and base habits. Yes, salvation costs all that we have. But its
worth is inestimable.

  How do we become aware of the perfect Pearl? John 14:16-18;
15:26; 16:13, 14; 1 Cor. 12:3.


    Compare Paul's words in Philippians 3:7, 8 to the merchant's
 behavior when he found the pearl. Do you feel as Paul does? If
 not, why? If so, what can you do this week to share the "excel-
 lence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus" (NKJV), your Lord?
 (Note the "double significance" of the parable. See Christ's Ob-
 ject Lessons, p. 118.)

                                                                      15

BURIED TREASURE (Matt. 13:44).

   Imagine that you live in a time when there are no banks. Thieves
abound, and new political powers heavily tax your possessions.
Furthermore, the threat of plundering armies looms frequently on the
horizon. How would you safeguard what wealth you had? Bury it
perhaps? In Jesus' day, that is exactly what many people did. But it
would not be unusual for you to forget the exact spot where you had
hidden the treasure. Or perhaps you die, are imprisoned, or exiled.
Then your treasure is lost until someone comes along to till the land
and, in so doing, unearths it.
   Like the parable of the perfect pearl, this story symbolizes the
value of the gospel treasure. And just as the plowman was ready to
surrender everything he had to obtain the hidden riches, so "the finder
of heavenly treasure will count no labor too great and no sacrifice too
dear, in order to gain the treasures of truth."—Christ's Object
Lessons, p. 104.

   What motivated the farmer to sell all to buy the field? Matt. 13:44.


   "This selling of all is no arbitrary condition, imposed from without,
but rather a delightful constraint acknowledged within: even as a man
would willingly fling down pebbles and mosses with which he had
been filling his hands, if pearls and precious stones were offered him
in their stead."—Richard Chenevix Trench, Parables of Our Lord
(New York, N.Y.: Fleming H. Revell, 1861), p. 106.
   That the finder feels he must have the treasure for his very own
signifies that true religion consists of a personal relationship with the
Saviour. Christ says, "Come to me" and "Learn from me" (Matt.
11:28, 29, NKJV; italics supplied), while 1 John 5:12 states that
"whoever has the Son has life" (NRSV). You must be able to believe
that Christ loves you. He died for you.

  Matthew 13 relates seven parables, four of which Jesus told to a
multitude. But He told the parables of hidden treasure and the
perfect pearl only to His disciples (verse 36). What do you think
His reasoning was for doing this?


    Ellen White states that "the field containing the treasure
 represents the Holy Scriptures."—Christ's Object Lessons,
 p. 104. What, then, does this parable suggest about Bible study?
 How can you start improving your Bible-study habits today?

UNFINISHED TOWERS; OUTNUMBERED KINGS (Luke 14:25-35).

   Read Luke 14:25-35. How do the parables in verses 28-33 relate
to the parables we studied Sunday and Monday?


  Describe the circumstance that prompted Jesus to tell these
parables. Verses 25-27.


    "He turned" (verse 25). As the multitude pursued Jesus, He stopped
and turned to face them. He was on His way to Jerusalem and the
cross. But most of the people following Him thought He was on His
way to establish an earthly empire. Thus, He told them that anyone
who followed Him must do so with a loyalty that would renounce
their most cherished possessions.
    "Hate not his father" (verse 26). "In the Bible, 'to hate,' often
should be understood simply as a typical Oriental hyperbole meaning
`to love less.' "—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 811. (See Matt.
10:37.) Therefore, if we love anything or anyone more than we love
Christ, we cannot be His disciple. The cost of discipleship includes all
that a person has in this life—"plans, ambitions, friends, relatives,
possessions, riches—anything, and everything that might interfere
with service for the kingdom of heaven."—SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 5, p. 812.
    To emphasize the necessity of counting the cost of discipleship,
Jesus then told the parables in verses 28-32. The tower could have
been a reference to the high structures in vineyards where watchmen
sat to guard against robbers who might steal the harvest. Or Jesus
could have been thinking about Herod who was obsessed with
constructing great buildings. Such buildings others would no doubt
imitate. And no doubt many of these imitations remained unfinished,
owing to insufficient planning and funding. But the cost of being a
 Christian must include a complete and lasting surrender of our wills to
 Christ.
    "Here [Luke 14:34], the flavor of 'salt' represents the spirit of
 devotion. Discipleship without this spirit of devotion, Jesus declares,
 is without meaning."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 812.

    Have you counted the cost of following Christ? What moti-
 vates your relationship with Him?




                                                                    17
Wednesday                                                     July 9
WHERE IS YOUR TREASURE? (Luke 12:13-34).

   What situation prompted Jesus to tell the parable of the rich
fool? Luke 12:13 (compare Deut. 21:17).


   "According to the Mosaic law of inheritance, the older brother
received two shares of his father's goods, and the remaining brother
or brothers a single share each. . . . Perhaps it was the younger son
who in this case appealed to Jesus and objected to the older brother's
actually taking the double portion assigned to him by law."
—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 795.

   How is the rich fool different from the two characters in the
parables we studied Sunday and Monday? How is the questioner
in verse 13 like the rich fool?


   The foolish rich man asked the right question ("What shall I do?").
But he gave the wrong answer ("I shall build bigger barns."). And in
so doing, he branded himself as a slave to the idol of his own greed.
(See Col. 3:5.)
   Notice how many times the fool used the words I and my. His love
for self prevented him from fufilling the first requirement of the law:
"Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul
and with all your strength and with all your mind" (Luke 10:27, NIV;
see Deut. 6:5; Exod. 20:3-11). Naturally, then, he could not fulfill the
second requirement of the law: "Love your neighbor as yourself"
(Luke 10:27, NIV; see Lev. 19:18; Exod. 20:12-17). Instead of using
his abundance to feed widows, orphans, and other impoverished people,
he used it to gratify his own desires.
   The verses immediately following the parable (Luke 12:22-34)
pointedly provide an alternative lifestyle to that of the rich man in the
parable. Jesus implies that even the birds and flowers know better than
the wealthy fool! Verse 34 pronounces the folly of living for material
goods and the final verdict against our poor rich fool—his heart was
locked inside his musty storage buildings, withering away for lack of
the Son's light. We may safely assume that the life Jesus characterized
as worthy in verses 22-34 is the life lived by the merchant who
searched for the perfect pearl and by the man who found the buried
treasure.

    Where is your treasure stored? Why does this parable not
 rule out careful provision for our financial future?

THE TWO DEBTORS (Luke 7:36-50).

   The parable of the two debtors displays the only two attitudes we
can have toward God's forgiveness—gratitude or selfish indifference.
The parable shows the principle that an individual's appreciation for
God's forgiveness is based on that individual's sense of need for His
forgiveness.

   Identify and describe the three main characters in Luke 7:36-40.


  Now match the people in the parable (verses 41-43) with the
characters in verses 36-40.

 The man who owed much

 The man who owed little

 The money lender

    The amount each debtor owed did not make a difference. Neither
person was able to repay his loan. The difference lies in the appreciation
each debtor exhibited toward the creditor's forgiveness.
    As a Pharisee, Simon based his righteousness upon his own ability
to follow a set of laws. Confident of his own strength, he felt he was
already a good person. Therefore, he was not aware of his need for
Christ's forgiveness. "The one thing which shuts a man off from God
is self-sufficiency."—William Barclay, The Gospel of Luke (Philadel-
phia, Pa.: The Westminister Press, 1956), p. 95.
    With great scorn Simon viewed the scene before him. Pharisees
believed that men incurred ceremonial defilement if a woman touched
them. To have a prostitute touch you incurred serious defilement. And
here was the rabbi Jesus allowing this harlot not only to touch Him,
but to kiss Him and to anoint Him with costly perfume possibly
purchased with funds gained from her profession. But this woman
recognized her inability to redeem herself. Her behavior, unlike Simon's,
demonstrated both this recognition and her profound appreciation for
the Saviour's gift of grace.
    How Simon must have bristled when Jesus did not declare his sins
 forgiven while pronouncing that the woman's sins were forgiven.

    With which of the characters in today's lesson do you most
 identify? Are you honest enough to admit that maybe it might be
 Simon, whose debt was the greater? (SLe The Desire of Ages,
 p. 567.) How deeply do you sense your need?

                                                                      19

FURTHER STUDY: Wednesday's lesson dealt with greed and how
it keeps us from accepting God's offer of salvation. Study the following
instances of selfishness and selflessness. What does the outcome of each
tell us about these two characteristics? Num. 22-24; 31:8; Joshua 6:24; 7:1,
19-25; John 6:1-14; Acts 9:36-42.

   Read any of the following: Christ's Object Lessons, "Hidden Treas-
ure," pp. 103-114; "The Pearl," pp. 115-121; "Gain That Is Loss," pp.
252-259; The Desire of Ages, "The Feast at Simon's House," pp. 557-568.

   "There are some who are seeking, always seeking, for the goodly
pearl. But they do not make an entire surrender of their wrong habits.
They do not die to self that Christ may live in them. Therefore they do
not find the precious pearl. . . .
   "A daily consecration to God brings peace and rest. The merchant
sold all that he had to possess the pearl. When those who are seeking
for salvation refuse to fail or be discouraged, they will find peace and
rest in the Lord. Christ will clothe them with His righteousness."
—Selected Messages, book 1, pp. 399, 400.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Explain what you have learned this week about the value of
     truth, the effort necessary to secure it, various ways of
     receiving the truth, and things that might prevent us from
     accepting it.

   2. What possessions guide your life and direct you away from
      God? Might God be asking you to give up these possessions
      in order to spend more time with Him? When does giving
      something up mean getting rid of it completely or control-
      ling yourself in the use of it?

   3. What does the parable of the rich fool teach us about the
      stewardship of abundance? Was Christ condemning wealth
      or one's attitude toward it? Explain your answer.

   4. In Luke 7:50, Jesus tells the woman that her faith has saved
      her. What does this imply about the relationship of faith to
      forgiveness? (See Heb. 11:6.) What does the woman's be-
      havior tell us about the relationship between faith and works?
      (See James 2:14-25.)

SUMMARY: God stands ready and able to grant us forgiveness and a
new life in Him. If, with great appreciation, we are willing to give all
of ourselves to Him, His saving power will take effect in our lives.

                                   A Helping Hand
                                 Neria da Silva Mendonca

             On Sabbath afternoon, I went to visit a family whose name I had
         been given. A man, Joao, his wife, Lucilene, and four small children
         lived in a scene of intense poverty, hunger, and filth. I wondered how
         the family could focus on studying the Bible when their material
         needs were so great, but Joao eagerly told me about a dream he had.
         "I was going to a dance, but I came to a crossroad, and I did not know
         which way to go. A man dressed in white with a Bible in his hand
         stood beside me. I asked him for directions, and he opened the Bible
         and said: 'The way is this one.' " Then Joao added, "God has brought
         you here. Yes, we want to study the Bible."
             I went to visit the family several Sabbaths in a row but did not
         find them home. Then I learned that they had moved. I located
         them living in a hut made of dirty planks under a tree infested
         with ants. Their month-old baby's body was covered with ant
         bites. Because of their need, some church members and I began a
         Branch Sabbath School there. We taught hygiene and health, and
         slowly we were able to change these people's habits. Commu-
         nity Services helped with clothing and shoes, and soon Joao and
         Lucilene asked for baptism. But Lucilene was a minor, and they
         had not been married, so they had to wait for baptism.
             One day Joao called me, very upset. I went to see them and
         found that Lucilene had been beaten by the neighbors. Joao was
         so angry he wanted to kill the offenders. Weeping with them, I
          opened the Bible to Romans 12:19-21 and read, "Do not take
          revenge, . . . but leave room for God's wrath, for it is written: 'It
          is mine to avenge; I will repay,' says the Lord. . . . Do not be
          overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good." Slowly Joao
          calmed down.
             We prayed and asked God to help them find another home.
          When I returned home, I met a friend who needed someone to
          live on an unoccupied ranch he owned. It had a house, water, and
          light. I hurried to tell Joao and his family. Two days later, the
          family moved. It was difficult for them to get to church, but they
          did not lose courage.
             Today they live happily with their children. They have enough
          food and a good home. Daily they praise God, awaiting the return of
          the Lord Jesus Christ, because they heard the voice of an angel.

         Seeds and Banquets




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 13:1-9, 18-23;
Luke 14:16-24.

  MEMORY TEXT: "Listen! I am standing at the door, knocking;
  if you hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to you and
  eat with you, and you with me" (Revelation 3:20, NRSV).

   KEY THOUGHT: God's offer of salvation is received or rejected
by different types of people. But those who fully accept His grace, He
blesses beyond measure.

   ANOTHER BUSY DAY IN JESUS' LIFE WAS COMING TO
A CLOSE. Earlier He had healed a man who was blind, unable to
talk, and devil-possessed (Matt. 12:22, 23). Afterward, the Pharisees
accused Him of being in league with the prince of devils.
   Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law expressed their
desire for Him to prove He was the Messiah. In response, Jesus
referred to Jonah and proclaimed that the people of Nineveh would
stand at the judgment and condemn these Pharisees' generation.
   Jesus proceeded to the seashore, only to be followed by a throng of
people. Quite possibly, some of the Pharisees and scribes continued to
haunt His footsteps. As He related the parable of the sower, He no
doubt was considering the various people who had questioned and
doubted Him earlier.
   This week we will continue our study of parables that deal with the
reception of truth. As you explore the parables of the sower and the
great banquet, examine your life to learn how you receive God's truth.

THE PARABLE OF THE SOWER (Matt. 13:1-9, 18-23).

   Last week we studied how a merchant's eagerness to buy the
flawless pearl illustrates the reaction Christ would like all of us to
have when we encounter His grace. But as our next parable shows,
this will not always be the case.

   Read Mark 4:1-20. Then match the items in Column B to the
items in Column A.
        Column A                                      Column B

1. the sower             a. the human heart

2. the seed              b. the person who accepts Christ with joy but soon becomes
                          discouraged

3. the soil in general   c. the person who accepts Christ, obeys Him, and brings forth
                          fruit

4. the soil by the       d. Christ; those who do His work
 wayside

5. stony soil            e. the person who hears God's word but does not obey it

6. thorny soil           f. God's word; the gospel

7. good soil             g. the person who hears the Word but will not give up the old
                          life


   It had been quite a day (Matt. 12:22-50). And toward the end of it,
the press of the crowd forced Jesus to retreat to a boat (Matt. 13:1, 2).
Nearby lay the plain of Gennesaret and beyond the plain rose the hills.
From His floating pulpit, Jesus could see farmers casting the seed for
the second crop of the year. (See Christ's Object Lessons, p. 34.) In
the crowd, there was no doubt every type of person represented by the
four types of soil. All appeared most eager to receive His salvation.
But He knew that not all would. Could it be, therefore, "that Jesus
fashioned the parable in a kind of count-the-cost tone? . . . It may well
be for the crowd a challenge to right hearing, the importance of
attentive hearing. . . . Jesus presented a searching challenge to expose
the depth and character of the crowd's initial flurry."—Jones,
 The Teaching of the Parables, pp. 70, 71.

    Sit with the crowd by the edge of the sea. Earlier you wit-
 nessed Jesus healing the sick; you heard your religious leaders
 say He was in league with the devil. Why are you there now?

                                                                                       23

THE SOWER STARTS OUT (Matt. 13:3, 37).

   "In Oriental lands, . . . farmers dwelt together in villages for
protection against roving bands of robbers. In the morning, at
daybreak, they 'went forth' [Matt. 13:3, KJV] from their villages to
the surrounding fields, and at twilight they returned home again. In the
same way Christ, the Sower of truth, came 'forth' from the Father in
heaven to this world—the 'field' (see v. 38)—in order that He might
`bear witness unto the truth' (John 18:37; cf. ch. 10:10)."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 5, p. 404.
   "He [Christ] soweth the Word, and he is the Word. The spoken
word will not live in the hearts of the hearers without his grace, his
presence. Christians are born again of incorruptible seed—`by the
Word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever' (1 Pet. 1. 23;
compare also 1 John i11. 9). That incorruptible seed is the grace of
Christ, Christ's presence, Christ himself abiding in the heart by his
Spirit. His grace lives in the soul, growing, spreading through the
heart, filling it with a new life, transforming him in whom the seed
abideth into the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ."—The
Pulpit Commentary, The Gospel According to Matthew, vol. 2, p. 18.

  How would you describe a person represented by the wayside
ground? Matt. 13:3, 4, 19.


   The fields of Palestine sometimes consisted of long narrow strips
with the ground between strips used as a path or wayside. These paths
were worn rock hard by endless numbers of travelers. A farmer sowed
using one of the following methods: (1.) He could broadcast the seed
while walking through the field with the bag of seed slung over his
shoulder. If the wind was blowing, some of the seed could easily fall
on the wayside. (2.) As Barclay suggests, he could put a sack of seed
on the back of an ass, tear a hole in one corner of the sack, then walk
the animal through the fields while the seed leaked out of the sack.
Some of the seed would surely fall on the hardened path as the animal
crisscrossed over the waysides. (See Barclay, The Gospel of St.
Matthew, vol. 2, p. 58.)

    What does it take for a person to understand the gospel
 message? What causes lack of understanding? How can people's
 training and environment prevent them from hearing the gospel
 message? How can one presenting the gospel overcome the nega-
 tive influence of people's backgrounds? What influences does
 the evil one exert to prevent people from understanding the
 gospel?

STONY PLACES (Matt. 13:5, 6, 20, 21).

 Describe the type of person represented by the rocky soil.
Matt. 13:5, 6:20, 21; Luke 8:13.


   The stony soil consists of rocky ledges below a shallow surface of
soil. People who are like this type of soil receive the gospel seed with
joy, but fail to count the cost of discipleship. Considering only the
soothing, material benefits of religion, they "have never thought deeply
of the sharpness of the cross, of their own danger, of the sacrifices
which the cross demands."—The Pulpit Commentary, The Gospel
According to St. Matthew, vol. 2, p. 18. Thus when the scorching heat
of affliction and temptation beats upon them, when God asks them to
interrupt their cozy life to do an uncomfortable task or give up a
pleasing yet harmful habit, the tiny gospel plant quickly withers.

   What have the stony-ground hearers not experienced? John
3:3, 7; Titus 3:4, 5. How does John 6:41-66 enlarge upon our
understanding of stony-ground people?


   A great many people soon heard about the miracles recorded in
John 6:1-22. And seeking to satisfy their curiosity, they rushed to find
Jesus. They also hoped rather vainly to secure their temporal needs by
associating themselves with Him. Because Jesus was aware of their
motives, He said to them, " 'Do not labor for the food which perishes,
but for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of
Man will give you, because God the Father has set His seal on Him' "
(John 6:27, NKJV). But His following speech regarding the true
nature of what He had to offer offended their natural desires and long-
standing traditions. "They had welcomed His miracle-working power;
they were eager to be freed from disease and suffering; but they would
not come into sympathy with His self-sacrificing life. . . .
   "Praise and flattery would be pleasing to their ears; but the truth is
unwelcome; they cannot hear it. When the crowds follow, and the
multitudes are fed, and the shouts of triumph are heard, their voices
are loud in praise; but when the searching of God's Spirit reveals their
sin, and bids them leave it, they turn their backs upon the truth, and
walk no more with Jesus."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 391, 392.

    How deep has the gospel seed been able to take root in your
 heart? Read Luke 9:23. Are you willing to dedicate your life to
 Jesus every day, regardless of the cost?


                                                                     25

WORRISOME THORNS (Matt. 13:7, 22; Luke 8:14).

  What progression is evident regarding the ability of the seed to
grow in each of the first three types of soil?

1.On the wayside ground, the seed

2.On the rocky soil, the seed                                       but

                                            soon after.

3. Among thorns, the seed                                          , but



   In the stony ground, the young plants withered soon after the heat
of the sun touched them. But in the thorny ground, the plants lived
longer. Likewise, thorny-ground Christians become more mature in
their Christian experience than stony-ground hearers. They appear to
make a genuine start, and evidently experience the new birth. But
eventually their preoccupation with the worries and concerns of
everyday life chokes their Christian experience. They become too
busy or worried to pray and study God's Word.

   How would you define "the cares of this world and the deceit-
fulness of riches" (Matt. 13:22, NKJV) and the "pleasures of life"?
(Luke 8:14, NKJ). What advice does Christ give us regarding
these thorns? Matt. 6:24-34.


   "There are many whose hearts are aching under a load of care
because they seek to reach the world's standard. They have chosen its
service, accepted its perplexities, adopted its customs. Thus their
character is marred and their life made a weariness. The continual
worry is wearing out the life forces. Our Lord desires them to lay aside
this yoke of bondage. He invites them to accept His yoke; He says,
`My yoke is easy, and my burden is light.' Worry is blind and cannot
discern the future; but Jesus sees the end from the beginning. "
—The Ministry of Healing, p. 481.

    What fruits of the Spirit are choked by worry, the deceitful-
 ness of riches, and the pleasures of this world? See Gal. 5:22-25.
 What thorns might you need the Master Gardener to extermi-
 nate from your life? How do you plan to cooperate with Him in
 the process?

YOU ARE INVITED (Luke 14:16-24).

  Describe the setting of the parable of the great banquet. Luke
14:1-16.


  "The Jews had a series of ever-recurring conventional pictures of
what would happen when God broke into history and when the golden
days of the new age arrived. One of these was the picture of the
Messianic banquet. . . . It is of this banquet that the man who spoke to
Jesus was thinking. When he spoke of the happiness of those who
would be guests at that banquet he was thinking of Jews, and of Jews
only, for the average, orthodox Jew would never have dreamed that
gentiles and sinners would find a place at the feast of God."
—Barclay, The Gospel of Luke, p. 192.

  Match the following words or phrases to each part of the par-
able listed below: Jesus; giving the gospel to the Gentiles; God; the
gospel feast; the Jews.
 The great banquet

 The man giving the banquet

 The servant

 The guests who were invited first

 The highways and hedges


   The excuses some of the people gave for not attending the banquet
are much the same as ours for not receiving Christ's grace. (1) The
man who had purchased a field allowed business to override God's
claims. How many of us are so immersed in our daily business that we
neglect time to pray, study the Word, and worship God? (2) The man
who had bought the oxen and desired to try them out was at the mercy
of novelty. Does your new computer take up all your time? Or does
the hobby you just started take precedence over spiritual matters?
(3) This excuse involved a new spouse. Perhaps the man was thinking
of Deuteronomy 24:5. But even family can crowd out God's invitation
to mercy. Many people feel they cannot accept God's invitation,
because of problems it could create for their family or problems
family members might create for them.

   How might tradition, business, novelty, or family be holding
 you back from accepting God's invitation?

                                                                     27

FURTHER STUDY: In Luke 14:23, the man giving the banquet tells
his servant to "compel" the people to come to the banquet. Through
the ages, many people have thought this verse condoned the use of
force to convert people to Christianity. What light do Matthew 5:43-
47; 7:12; 10:14; 26:51, 52; Luke 9:51-55 shed on this problem? How
does the parable itself give us an answer? How did Jesus "compel"
people to believe in Him?

  Read either one of the following chapters from Christ's Object
Lessons: "The Sower Went Forth to Sow," pp. 33-61; "Go Into the
Highways and Hedges," pp. 219-237.

   "By the words 'compel them to come in' Jesus here simply empha-
sizes the urgency of the invitation and the compelling force of divine
grace. Loving-kindness was to be the compelling force. . . . There is a
vast difference between the insistent appeal that Jesus had in mind and
the resort to physical force that many professed Christians in centuries
gone by have considered appropriate, and that some who profess the
name of Christ would rely on today if they had the opportunity to do
SO.
   "Any use of force or persecution in matters of religion is a policy inspired
by the devil, not by Christ."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 810.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What have the parables of the sower and the great banquet
     taught you about the value of truth, various ways of receiv-
     ing the truth, and things that might prevent you from
     accepting it?

      2. Notice that Luke 14:1-24 revolves around banqueting. Jesus
         often referred to the kingdom in terms of a feast. What
         emotions do people usually exhibit on such occasions? What
         does this tell us about the type of Christianity that drains
         the color from life?

      3. How might Christ illustrate today the same concepts He
         illustrated with the parables of the sower and the great
         banquet?

SUMMARY: The parables of the sower and the great banquet tell us
how to receive the gospel into our hearts, and they teach us about the
dangers of divided hearts. The blessings of salvation find fertile soil in
hearts that accept Christ, obey, and thus bring forth fruit. Such hearts
do not favor daily business or possessions—nor are they absorbed
only by the concerns of family. They are singly focused on Christ.

                      I Should Have Died
                   Inge Gray and Ahissou Francis

    "The doctor said that I should have died," Antoinette Hounga
                                                                           I
testified at a women's meeting. "But God worked a miracle for me,
and I am alive and well. My doctor was so sure that I would die that
when I survived, he asked what church I belonged 10."
    Antoinette and her family live in the village of So-Tchanhoue in
                                                                           n
the tiny African country of Benin. The village is built over a lake.
Each building is constructed to stand several feet above the water.
People travel from place to place by boat, transport their goods to
market by boat, and even hold their marketplace in boats on the
water.
                                                                           s.
    When Antoinette's fifth child was due, she went to the village
maternity clinic to give birth. But after the baby was born, she began
to hemorrhage. Her blood pressure dropped to 70/40. Her husband
donated blood for an emergency blood transfusion, but Antoinette
continued to grow weaker. The only hope for her was to rush her to         d
the nearest hospital, a one-hour trip by boat. The midwife was sure
Antoinette would not survive the trip. Her husband cradled her and
the new baby in his arms as his brother steered the canoe toward help.
     When the family arrived at the hospital, Antoinette was uncon-
scious. When the doctors learned how far the family had come, they
                                                                           e
were surprised that she was still alive. They operated immediately
and were able to stop the internal bleeding. But they offered the
 husband little hope that she would recover. When Antoinette lived,
 her doctor could only say, "Your God saved you!"
     Antoinette's family had not known God long. The Adventist
 message reached their village in 1993 when a pastor and a layman
 from a neighboring village began visitation and Bible studies. When
                                                                           S
 they found interest in the village, the pastor held evangelistic meet-
 ings in an open field near the lake. When the rains were heavy, the
 pastor preached while standing in a foot of water. Large numbers of
 villagers came to hear him present the truths of the Bible, most
 listening from their canoes on the lake. Between 20 and 30 people
 now meet every Sabbath in a simple church in So-Tchanhoue.
     God is at work in So-Tchanhoue, the village on the water.
 Antoinette and the other members can testify to it. But thousands of
 other villages in Benin have not yet heard the message of a soon-
 coming Saviour. Pray that they will receive the hope we hold dear.

  Until 1995, Inge Gray worked with her husband in the Benin
Mission. Today they work in Cote d'Ivoire. Ahissou Francis is a
pastor in Benin.

        God's Grace Changes
           Our Direction




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 7:24-27; 12:43-45;
Luke 13:20, 21.

   MEMORY TEXT: "Therefore everyone who hears these words
   of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built
   his house on the rock" (Matthew 7:24, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: God's love for us compels Him to search for
us. Our reaction to His finding us changes forever the course of our
lives. If we accept His offer of salvation, His grace enables Him to
forgive us and to transform our characters into His likeness.

   TRANSFORMED DESIRES. Leo Tolstoy, the great Russian
author, described his conversion to Christ this way: "Five years ago
faith came to me: I believed in the doctrine of Jesus, and all my life
was suddenly changed. I ceased to desire that which previously I had
desired, and on the other hand, I took to desiring what I had never
desired before. That which formerly used to appear good in my eyes
appeared evil, and that which used to appear evil appeared good."
   All people who accept God's offer of salvation exchange their pride
for humility, their hatred for love, their selfishness for generosity, their
temper for sweetness, their anxiety for peace. With God's help, they
develop a character like His.
   Are you undergoing this process of exchange? Have you begun the
process, but stalled somewhere along the way? The parables we will
be studying for the next few weeks will help us understand the
importance of this process. This week we will learn about the foundation
necessary to undergo the process of change and the power God gives us
to reflect His character.

THE TWO BUILDERS, PART ONE (Matt. 7:24-27).

   The parable of the two builders concludes Christ's Sermon on
the Mount. What is this sermon's main point? Matt. 7:12; 5:17-20.
What principle does Matthew 7:12 restate? 1 John 4:21.


   "The entire Sermon on the Mount . . . is illustrative of this great
truth."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 357. Matthew 7:12
summarizes the last six of the Ten Commandments. Those people
whom God admits into His kingdom will have lived according to
Matthew 7:12. How we treat our fellow human beings indicates our
attitude toward God (Matt. 22:34-40; 1 John 3:14-24). The great truth
in Matthew 7:12 is the righteousness to which Jesus calls us in
Matthew 5:20. It is the righteousness of His character (Exod. 34:4-8;
Lev. 11:44). The righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees "consisted
in external adherence to the letter of the law; Christ called for insight
into, and cooperation with, the underlying principles of the law."
—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 333.

   The parable tells us about the means by which we may live our
lives according to Matthew 7:12. In the first part of the parable,
whom/what does the rock symbolize? Ps. 89:26; 1 Cor. 10:1-4;
3:11; Isa. 40:8.


   As the people heard the parable, they could see the streams that
wandered through the valley to the Sea of Galilee. As summer
advanced, these waterways withered into dusty troughs. But as winter's
rainy blasts increased in number, these streams swelled into turbulent
courses that often swept away the flimsy houses the peasants built
upon the grassy plains.
   In contrast, Jesus' listeners could also view houses built upon the
high rocks surrounding them. People had constructed these houses
with greater difficulty. But the houses on the rocks had withstood
years of severe weather.
   Through this parable, then, Jesus teaches us that we are to be like
the people who built upon the rock. When we accept Jesus and vow to
live by His principle of love, we make Him the foundation of our
characters (symbolized by the houses). He then becomes the means by
which we live according to Matthew 7:12.

   Luke 6:48 says that the man who built upon the rock dug
 deeply to secure his foundation. How deeply do you dig into
 Christ's Word to secure your spiritual foundation?

THE TWO BUILDERS, PART TWO (Matt. 7:24-27).

    In the study we began yesterday about the parable of the two
builders, we learned that only in building our characters upon Christ
the Rock are we transformed into His likeness. The parable also
illustrates the importance of doing so, for when the harsh weather beat
against the house on the rock, it stood firm. The same weather, how-
ever, completely destroyed the house built on the sand.

  Compare the fate of both houses with the destiny of those
people who choose to build upon Christ and those people who do
not. Rev. 21:1-8.


   "A man's character is like a house. . . . Every thought is like a piece of
timber in our house of life, every habit like a beam, every imagination
like a window, well or badly placed; and they all gather into some kind of
unity, seemly or grotesque. . . .
   "[Christ] is the architect: Whosoever heareth these sayings of
mine, and doeth them. Only on his truth can the life of men or
nations stand. We discuss our psychological methods, or our systems
of national defense and world government, and we do not take
seriously this claim of Christ; but history's logic falsifies us, and
confirms him. The house cannot be built except on his vertical, the
line between God and man which he has traced; and on his horizontal,
the dealings of man with man which his truth requires. Those two
lines are in his cross, one the grace of God toward man and man's
answering obedience, the other a crossbeam running through every
man's life in love."—The Interpreter's Bible, vol. 7, pp. 334, 335.

  If the rock represents Christ and His Word, what do you think
the sand represents? Eph. 4:14. What might the foul weather
symbolize?


   Just as a well-built structure standing on a stable foundation can
withstand natural forces, so can a person who depends on Christ
withstand the forces of evil. None of us, whether we are grounded in
Christ or not, can escape temptation, sorrow, and trial. But only those
of us grounded in Christ can withstand devastation from the blast of
this stormy trio.

    Just as the builders chose the foundations for their houses, so
 God made us free to choose to live by His principles. Upon which
 foundation will you build?

CLEANING HOUSE (Matt. 12:43-45).

   The parable of the two builders teaches us that grounding ourselves
in Christ transforms our character into His likeness. For the rest of this
week, we will study parables that teach us the role of the Holy Spirit in
the process of that transformation.

  To whom did Jesus specifically address the parable of the seven
unclean spirits, and why? Matt. 12:22-45.


    "This wicked generation" (verse 45). In general, Christ refers to the
people of Israel living during His time. Specifically, He is addressing
those scribes and Pharisees who were in the process of rejecting Him as
their Redeemer. They had swept their lives of outward sins. But they
remained barren of any loyalty beyond themselves. On a more personal
level, He was warning the man whom He had just cured of a demon
(Matt. 12:22). Empty houses do not remain empty for long. Quickly,
the nooks and crannies succumb to spiders and dust, as vermin scurry
across the floorboards.
    The parable is also "particularly applicable to those who have
listened to the gospel message gladly, but have not yielded to the Holy
Spirit. . . . These had not yet committed the unpardonable sin [blas-
phemy against the Holy Spirit], and Jesus warns them not 10."—SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 398.

   What type of ground in the parable of the sower does the man
in today's parable remind you of, and why?


   The man released from one devil had good intentions. But he did
not expect the return of that devil, let alone seven others. Therefore, he
declined to submit himself to Christ's control. "The Spirit of God
must come into the life and be placed in control of the thought and
conduct (see 2 Cor. 6:16; Eph. 2:22)."—SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 5, p. 399. Thus we see once again that it is not only release from
sin that Jesus offers us but re-creation and renewal. Such renewal,
gained through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, will empower us not
only to avoid evil, but to devote ourselves thoughtfully and industriously
to that which is pure and just. Christianity does not consist merely of
prohibitions, but of a positive, constructive force for good (Amos 5:15;
2 Thess. 2:10).

   What "devils" do you need to clean from your house? Ask the
 Lord now to help you replace them with His Spirit.

                                                                       33

HARD AND DRY VERSUS SOFT AND POROUS (Matt. 13:33;
Luke 13:20, 21).

   The parable of the leaven also deals with the role of the Holy Spirit
in transforming our lives. To the Jews, it must have been a shocking
story. Because Jewish thought usually connected leaven with sin (Matt.
16:6; 1 Cor. 5:6-8; Gal. 5:9), preparations for the Passover included
removing every piece of leaven from the house and burning it. Yet this
shock surely must have aroused their interest!
   Perhaps the people most likely to grasp His meaning were the
women who spent their days baking. Any woman who used leaven
knew that it made bread soft, porous, and delicious, as opposed to dry,
hard, and tasteless. Thus, this illustration "came nearer home than in
any other because he [Jesus] took it from the kitchen of an ordinary
house."—Barclay, The Gospel of Matthew, vol. 2, p. 79.

  Leaven completely transforms dough. In what ways does the
Holy Spirit transform us? Gal. 5:16-26; 6:2; Eph. 4:17-24, 31-5:1.
How do these texts relate to Matthew 7:12?


   Christianity transforms the individual, improving life for many
groups of people, as well. In its infancy, Christianity improved life for
the following:
1. The ill. It was common to view such people as an annoyance. But
   Christians founded the first free dispensary, home for the blind, and
   hospital. How did Christ treat such people?
2. The aged who also were considered a nuisance. Read what the
   Bible says in Leviticus 19:32; Proverbs 23:22; 1 Peter 5:5. Can you
   find other verses?
3. The child. In the early Christian centuries, divorce was rampant.
   The lot of women was often very difficult. In such situations,
   having children could be disastrous. How did Christ view marriage
   and children?
4. Women. In his morning prayers, a Jewish man thanked God that he
   was not born a Gentile, a slave, or a woman. How did Christ treat
   women?

    As the Holy Spirit transforms your life to reflect Christ's
 character, how can you improve life today for a person in one of
 the above four groups? (Remember, however, that only with the
 second coming and the destruction of Satan will all ills be cured.)

HOW DOES IT WORK? (Matt. 13:33).

   Yesterday we began studying the parable of leaven. We noted that
just as leaven transforms a lump of dough into delicious bread, so the
Holy Spirit transforms our lives into people who reflect Christ's
character. Today we will compare the way leaven works with the way
the Holy Spirit works.

   Where does the woman put the leaven? Matt. 13:33. Relate this
to how the Holy Spirit works in our lives.


   "As the leaven . . . works from within outward, so it is by the
renewing of the heart that the grace of God works to transform the life.
No mere external change is sufficient to bring us into harmony with
God. There are many who try to reform by correcting this or that bad
habit, and they hope in this way to become Christians, but they are
beginning in the wrong place. Our first work is with the heart."
—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 97.

   What element in the parable symbolizes the heart?


   Leaven also works in the following ways:
1. The leaven works unseen. Likewise, the Holy Spirit works unseen.
   But we can see the work it does. The leaven turns an inert lump of
   dough into a bubbling, growing mound. The Holy Spirit has the
   power to change our lives just as dramatically. (See John 3:1-8.)
2. While the leaven can do its work only from inside the dough,
   yet it comes from outside the dough. The dough has no ability of
   its own to change itself. Neither can we change ourselves. When
   we try and fail (and we will fail), we plunge into the clutches of
   legalism. We need a power outside of ourselves. And that power is
   the Holy Spirit.

  As we commit ourselves to studying and obeying God's Word, the
Holy Spirit will convict us of sin and transform us to Christ's image.
Then we will be equipped to do God's will and share with others what
Christ, through His Holy Spirit, has done for us and can do for them.

    Make a list of things you do each day. Note how much time
 you spend on each item. How much time do you spend studying
 the Bible? How might you find more time to do so?



                                                                     35

FURTHER STUDY: Study the lives of Saul and Judas: 1 Sam.
10:9-13; 16:14; 18:10, 11; 19:9; 31:1-6; Matt. 10:1-4; Luke 22:3-6;
John 13:21-30; 18:2-5; Matt. 27:3-10. How were they like the man in
the parable of the seven unclean spirits? What had both men failed to
do with their lives?

   Review Monday's and Tuesday's lesson. Then read 1 Corin-
thians 13:1-13. How has your study of the parable of the two
builders helped you to understand better this great chapter?

  Read Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, "Not Judging, But
Doing" [comment on Matthew 7:251, pp. 147-152; Christ's Object
Lessons, "Like Unto Leaven," pp. 95-102.

    "The leaven hidden in the flour works invisibly to bring the whole
mass under its leavening process; so the leaven of truth works
secretly, silently, steadily, to transform the soul. The natural
inclinations are softened and subdued. New thoughts, new feelings,
new motives, are implanted. A new standard of character is set up—the
life of Christ. The mind is changed; the faculties are roused to action in
new lines. Man is not endowed with new faculties, but the faculties he
has are sanctified. The conscience is awakened. We are endowed with
traits of character that enable us to do service for God."—Christ's
Object Lessons, pp. 98, 99.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How does the parable of the two builders define wisdom
     and foolishness? (Review Matt. 7:24-27; see also Ps. 14:1;
     Prov. 1:7; 3:7; 12:15; 1 Cor. 1:20; 3:20-23.)

   2. Review the parable of the seven unclean spirits. What
      illustrations might be used today to illustrate the same point?

   3. Finish the following: Leaven transforms dough into soft,
      porous, delicious bread. The Holy Spirit transforms our
      lives into . . .

SUMMARY: God forgives us. But He doesn't stop there. His grace
also transforms us so that we reflect His Son's character. This
transformation is produced by the power of the Holy Spirit as we
ground ourselves firmly on Jesus Christ, the Rock of Salvation.

                  Atul Invited Us, Part 1
                        V. J. Khandagle

   Atul Auchite (OW-she-tay) has every reason to be unhappy.
Childhood polio left him unable to walk or play as other boys. He
cannot work with his father or help his mother carry water. But
Atul, who lives in a small, two-room house in a village in
Maharashtra (Ma-ha-ROSH-tra) State in western India, is a happy,
outgoing 12-year-old. He enjoys school and is an eager learner.
    Until three years ago, Atul's family worshiped Hindu gods.
Then an Adventist minister came to his village. He visited Atul's
parents and told them about God and His love for them. As Atul
listened, he became excited. He wanted others to hear these
stories, as well. He begged his parents to invite the pastor back.
    When the pastor returned, he found the family's small home
crowded with people waiting to hear the stories about Jesus.
When he asked who had invited them, the visitors answered,
"Atul invited us." He had crawled or been carried from home to
home and invited relatives and friends to learn about Jesus.
Atul's eyes glistened with excitement as the pastor praised his
efforts.
    The pastor visited Atul's home regularly, teaching the people
about God. Each time the pastor came, people crowded into
Atul's home. Hindus, who had not known God, grew to love
Him, and Christians of other faiths began to study their Bible
more as they learned new truths from the Bible. Many began
keeping the Sabbath.
    When the pastor announced evangelistic meetings in the vil-
lage, Atul invited everyone he knew—school friends, relatives,
Hindus, and Christians. More than 60 people crowded into Atul's
small home for the meetings. And 25 accepted the pastor's invi-
tation to accept Jesus and be baptized, including Atul. Following
further studies, the new believers were baptized in a public cer-
                         emony, all because a young boy who had
                         every good reason to be unhappy with
                         the world found his joy in Jesus.

            Growing in Grace




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Mark 4:26-32.

  MEMORY TEXT: "I pray that out of his [the Father's] glori-
  ous riches he may strengthen you with power through his Spirit
  in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts
  through faith" (Ephesians 3:16, 17, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: The kingdom of God consists of the work of
His grace in our hearts. The Holy Spirit transforms Christ's words into
a dynamic force that prepares us for eternal life and motivates us to
proclaim the last message of God's mercy (Rev. 14:6-14).

   THE SCENE IS A FAMILIAR ONE. Jesus retreated to the sea-
shore, only to be followed by such a crowd that He had to seek refuge
in a boat.
   The majority of those following Him probably believed that the
Messianic prophecies promised a political messiah who would deliver
them from Rome and assist them in establishing an earthly kingdom of
their own. Many of them hoped that Jesus was this messiah. Little did
they care, or perhaps even realize, that Rome's dominance over them
was a direct result of their disregard of God's love. (See SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 4, pp. 30-33.)
   Thus, many of Jesus' parables instructed His followers regarding
the true character of His kingdom. The two parables we will study this
week are of this nature. They emphasize, as did the parables we
examined last week, the role of the Holy Spirit in the growth of our
Christian experience. As you study, ask yourself what role the Holy
Spirit has played or is playing in your life.

THE GROWING SEED, PART ONE (Mark 4:26-29).

   Last week we learned that when we are established in Christ He
transforms our character into His likeness. We also studied the Holy
Spirit's role in this accomplishment. The parable of the growing seed
expands upon this theme.

 Give titles to the three main sections of this parable as found in
Mark 4:26-29.


   "According to verse 27, the seed germinates and sprouts; it springs
up and matures in a mysterious manner that goes almost unnoticed.
This is the emphasis behind Mark's phrase 'he knows not how.' In
verse 28 it is stressed that it is not by human intervention that the seed
grows; the earth produces fruit 'spontaneously.' This does not mean
that the sower abandons his work, nor that he is uninterested in what
takes place. . . . It means that the seed must be allowed its appointed
course, as the process of growth and ripening advances toward a
harvest that is approaching. The sower takes account of the growth of
the seed, but he cannot fully understand it. His ultimate interest is in
the purpose for which the seed was sown."—William L. Lane,
The Gospel According to Mark, The New International Commentary
on the New Testament (Grand Rapids, Mich.: William B. Eerdmans,
1974), vol. 2, p. 169.

    What do the following parts of the parable symbolize: (1) the growth
of the seed; (2) the power motivating that growth? John 3:1-8.


   This parable illustrates the same truth Jesus spoke to Nicodemus
regarding the work of the Holy Spirit. To be "born of the Spirit" is to
have God as our Father and to be like Him in character (1 John 3:1-3).
As children of God who are constantly receiving the grace of Christ,
we do not have to yield to sin (Rom. 6:12-16; 1 John 3:9; 5:18); we
seek always to maintain union with Him. We are unable to explain the
process of Christian growth and character transformation, but like the
growth of the planted seed, it carries on invisibly.

    Which of the following characterizes your Christian growth?
 (1) The seed has not yet been planted. (2) The grain is flourish-
 ing. (3) There is a drought. Consider what farmers do to help the
 seed grow. What things can you do to assist your spiritual growth?
 What efforts might actually hinder spiritual growth?


                                                                      39

THE GROWING SEED, PART TWO (Mark 4:26-29).

    Review yesterday's lesson, then meditate upon the following
statement: "As the plant receives the sunshine, the dew, and the
rain, we are to open our hearts to the Holy Spirit. The work is to
be done 'not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, saith the
Lord of hosts.' Zech. 4:6.... By constantly relying upon Christ as
our personal Saviour, we shall grow up into Him in all things who
is our head."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 67. Record one or two of
your thoughts regarding this quote in the space below.


   Just as the seed grows to produce grain, so the object of
Christian growth is the reproduction of Christ's character in the
believer's life. How does Galatians 5:13-26 describe this
reproduction?


    The fruit of the Spirit are those traits that develop when people
invite the Spirit to live in their hearts. This fruit is not the harvest of
human nature, but the result of a force entirely external to us that
works within us.
   "Salvation is not just a business transaction. It is a relationship. . . .
We need salvation not only from death and the ravages of sin but from
sin itself, from the iniquity that cuts us off from God. We need to have re-
established the harmony and unity that Adam enjoyed with God before
the Fall. . . .
   "To re-establish this relationship, to bring man into harmony with
God and in line with the stipulations of the covenant, is the work of
the Holy Spirit."—Raymond H. Woolsey, The Spirit and His Church,
pp. 57, 58.
   The Jews wanted a messiah who would coerce other nations to
submit to Israel. But through the parable of the growing seed, Jesus
taught that the Messiah's kingdom begins in an individual's heart,
affects every aspect of a person's life, and spills over into the lives of
others with the vibrant strength of His love.
   When Jesus came to us as the Son of man, He veiled His glory as the
Son of God. The kingdom He established then was His kingdom of
grace. At His second advent, the eternal kingdom that He then inaugurates
(Dan. 7:14, 27; Rev. 11:15) will be His kingdom of glory.

     Name three instances from the life of Christ illustrating how He
 exhibited the fruit of the Spirit. These fruit demonstrate His character,
 a character the Holy Spirit longs to help us develop. Pray for the Spirit
 to transform your heart and the church at large.

THE GROWING SEED, PART THREE (Mark 4:26-29).

   For what purpose (other than developing a Christlike charac-
ter) does the grain grow? Isaiah 55:10, 11 gives a clue.


   "There can be no growth or fruitfulness in the life that is centered in
self. If you have accepted Christ as a personal Saviour, you are to
forget yourself, and try to help others. Talk of the love of Christ, tell of
His goodness. Do every duty that presents itself. Carry the burden of
souls upon your heart, and by every means in your power seek to save the lost.
As you receive the Spirit of Christ—the Spirit of unselfish love and labor for
others—you will grow and bring forth fruit. The graces of the Spirit will ripen
your character. Your faith will increase, your convictions deepen, your love
be made perfect. More and more you will reflect the likeness of Christ in all
that is pure, noble, and lovely."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 67, 68.

   Who in the Bible exemplified the seed growing to bring forth
fruit for others? What types of thing did she do, and for whom?
Acts 9:36-42.


   "All the widows" (Acts 9:39). In ancient times, the life of a widow
was usually difficult (Luke 21:2-4). But Judaism and Christianity did
much to improve their situation (Deut. 14:29; 27:19; Mark 12:40;
James 1:27). Under the Mosaic law, widows, who were often
exploited (Ps. 94:6; Isa. 1:23; Mal. 3:5), were granted protection.
Exodus 22:22 states that widows were not to be taken advantage of,
while Deuteronomy 24:17 states that a creditor could not take a widow's
clothing as collateral for a debt. Widows received a portion of the
third-year tithe (Deut. 26:12), and they shared the right to glean the
fields (Deut. 24:19-21).
   The same Holy Spirit who enabled Peter to raise Dorcas from the
dead guided Dorcas' good deeds. Her work for others was proof that
she had accepted Christ.

    Look around you. What groups and individuals are being
 exploited or taken advantage of in your church, place of employ-
 ment, neighborhood, etc.? Now honestly consider your life over
 the past few months. What have you done for someone like this
 without seeking any gain in return? Finally, in what ways have
 you shared your faith? Determine with the Holy Spirit's help to
 be a blessing to others every day of your life.

A SMALL BEGINNING, PART ONE (Mark 4:30-32).

    As you read the parable of the mustard seed, consider the following
description:
    The plant to which Jesus most likely referred is the black mustard,
whose seed is about a millimeter in diameter. Yet a mature plant can
grow as high as 12 feet with branches an inch or more thick. Its
four-petaled yellow flowers produce tiny black seeds that attract
goldfinches and linnets to feed among the foliage.
    "The smallest seed you plant" (Mark 4:31, NIV). While the
mustard seed was not technically the smallest of seeds, it was noted
for its minuteness. Jews referred to a drop of blood as small as a
mustard seed. Or if they were discussing a minuscule infraction of the
ceremonial law, the rabbis would talk about it in terms of the
smallness of the mustard seed. Thus it was not unusual for Jesus
Himself to refer to it.
    Women often used the black mustard to cook with. In the spring,
they prepared the tender leaves to eat. And when the seeds matured,
they would grind them for use as a dressing or flavoring. They also
mixed the seeds in a plaster used to relieve pain. Oil from the seeds
worked as a laxative. Thus the mustard seed and plant provided an
illustration to which most of the people listening to Jesus could relate.

   The parable of the growing seed emphasized the growth of the
seed and the power behind that growth. What does the growth
symbolize? Mark 4:31, 32.


   "The Jewish leaders looked with contempt upon the motley throng
now intently listening to Jesus, particularly the few unlearned
peasants and fishermen who, as His disciples, sat next to Him. They
concluded that Jesus could not possibly be the Messiah and that the
`kingdom' He proclaimed, composed of this insignificant group of
followers, would never amount to anything. Jesus could have chosen
no better representation of the way His 'kingdom' appeared to the
minds of unregenerate men than the illustration of the insignificant
mustard seed. . . .
   "Here the figure of a 'tree' represents the triumph of the gospel
message throughout the world. The kingdom and its subjects might
appear insignificant now, but, says Christ, this will not always be the
case."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 409.

   Explain the role the Holy Spirit plays in the "triumph of the
gospel message throughout the world." How can you have a part

A SMALL BEGINNING, PART TWO (Mark 4:30-32).

   As you review Mark 4:30-32, ask yourself how the parable of
the mustard seed assures us of the growth and success of God's
kingdom.


   This is one of Jesus' most personal, touching parables. His
immediate band of disciples was very small compared to the largeness of
the work they were to initiate. They were pitted against some difficult
odds, not the least of which included coming from a low rung of the
socioeconomic ladder. In addition, they were often tripping over their
own egos and temperaments. Surely they would despair again and again.
But now their Leader, through the use of a most familiar object, was
reassuring them of success. Indeed, it would be a parable to encourage
them long after His return to heaven. Jesus would send His emissary, the
Holy Spirit, to remind them (John 14:26).

  What do the birds (Mark 4:32) and their act of nesting in the
branches of the mustard plant represent?


   "Could this be related to Daniel 4:12 and Ezekiel 17:23; 31:6,
where the people of all nations are given the promise of a place in
God's kingdom? Rabbinical literature at times used the phrase 'birds
of heaven' to refer to the Gentiles. . . .
   "Let all the birds of the air find a place in the mustard tree. The
gospel of Jesus must create a nesting place for all the peoples of the
world—for men and women, for Black and White, for the rich and the
poor, for the educated and the illiterate, for the caste and the casteless,
and all the in-betweens. For in Christ, we have no division, but
oneness; we have no nation, but one commonwealth of God (Phil.
3:20)."—John M. Fowler, "Appreciating the Importance of Little Things,"
Adventist Review, October 22, 1992, p. 7.

   Compare the symbolism of the mustard plant providing shelter
for the birds with the symbolism of the seed growing to provide
sustenance.


    "In us as individuals, is the seed of grace growing, giving
 shelter to the 'birds of the air'?"—Fowler, p. 7. What can you do
 to provide shelter for someone in need of Christ's grace? A kind
 word, a smile, a thoughtful deed are small seeds that can make a
 vast difference.

                                                                       43

FURTHER STUDY: The parable of the mustard seed is about great
things coming from small beginnings. Read the following Bible
stories that pertain to the same theme. What does each account teach
you about yourself? About God? 1 Kings 17:1-24; Matt. 16:5-12;
Luke 21:1-4.

   Choose from the following: Christ's Object Lessons, "First the
Blade, Then the Ear," pp. 62-69; "Like a Grain of Mustard Seed,"
pp. 76-79; "Other Lessons From Seed-sowing," pp. 80-89; Steps to
Christ, "Growing Up Into Christ," pp. 67-75; "The Work and the
Life," pp. 77-83; The Desire of Ages, "Nicodemus," pp. 167-177.

   "The only way to grow in grace is to be disinterestedly doing the
very work which Christ has enjoined upon us—to engage, to the
extent of our ability, in helping and blessing those who need the help
we can give them. Strength comes by exercise; activity is the very
condition of life. Those who endeavor to maintain Christian life by
passively accepting the blessings that come through the means of
grace, and doing nothing for Christ, are simply trying to live by eating
without working. And in the spiritual as in the natural world, this
always results in degeneration and decay. A man who would refuse to
exercise his limbs would soon lose all power to use them. Thus the
Christian who will not exercise his God-given powers not only fails to
grow up into Christ, but he loses the strength that he already had."
—Steps to Christ, pp. 80, 81.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Relate this week's memory text to the two parables we
     studied this week. Consider what these verses say about the
     Holy Spirit. Where do you see the element of growth in
     these verses? (see also verses 18 and 19.)

   2. Consider who the sower might be in each of the parables.
      (Matthew 13:31, 32 mentions a sower.) In what ways could
      it be Christ? His followers? How do you see yourself as a
      sower?

SUMMARY: Christ's kingdom is a kingdom of grace, sprouting like
a tiny seed in each of our hearts, rooting and grounding itself in
Christ's love through the power of the Holy Spirit, and growing to
produce the fruit of the Spirit for the benefit of others.

Wakal   M&
                            Atul Invited Us, Part 2
                                  V. J. Khandagle

             When young Atul first heard about Jesus, he became excited
         and shared the good news with anyone who would listen. Follow-
         ing evangelistic meetings in Atul's home, the boy and 25 others,
         most of whom Atul had invited to attend, accepted Jesus as their
         Saviour and were baptized.
             Although Atul cannot walk, he eagerly witnesses for God. He
         is a natural leader and has helped to form a singing group that
         witnesses for the Lord. His faith and testimony are a strong
         attraction to the people who hear him. His zeal in his newfound
         mission for Christ is an important factor in the growth of the
         church in his village.
             The polio that crippled Atul has crippled thousands in India.
         And Atul has encouraged and witnessed to others who share his
         affliction. He uses an old hand-pedaled tricycle to get around on
         the dirt roads in his village. The rough roads are hard on the
         tricycle, which often needs repair. But Atul or his father do the
         best they can to repair it so he can continue his missionary work
         for Jesus. Atul is witnessing to three Hindu friends, all crippled
         by polio. The three ride to church on the back of Atul's tricycle.
         The Hindu boys are learning about God as Atul shares his hope,
         his courage—and his tricycle. Atul hopes that soon his friends
         will accept Jesus as Lord of their lives.
             The church in Atul's village is growing, and members hope
         that soon they can build a church, but for now they crowd into
         Atul's parents' home. A church will cost about $5,000, far be-
         yond the peasant believers' ability to pay.
             Pray for Atul and his family, as they struggle with daily living
          in a harsh and unforgiving land where millions of children are
         hungry, needy, blind, or handicapped. Pray that God will provide
                                     a simple church in which to worship.
                                     Pray for Atul, who refuses to accept
                                     discouragement as he shares his hope in
                                     Jesus with anyone who will listen to
                                     him.

                                    Atul (left), now 13 years old, continues
                                    to witness for the Lord he loves. V. J.

                  Prayer Power




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Luke 11:5-13; 18:1-8.

   MEMORY TEXT: "For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,
   and his ears are open to their prayers" (1 Peter 3:12, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: A healthy prayer life is as necessary to sustain
Christian growth as breathing is to sustain our physical existence.
Prayer is the breath of the soul.

   PRAYER WARRIORS. When William IV of England died, a
17-year-old girl was sleeping in the palace. After awakening to the
news that she was now the Queen of England, she fell to her knees and
prayed that the Lord would guide her through the years ahead. Thus
Queen Victoria began one of the greatest reigns of British history.
   Fanny Crosby always prayed before she attempted to write a hymn.
Considering that she wrote approximately 8,000 hymns, she must
have prayed a great deal.
   And Martin Luther said that he prayed an hour each day, except on
those days which he knew would be particularly busy. Then he spent
two hours in prayer.
   The parables we will study this week teach us the importance of
prayer in the process of Christian growth. Is prayer a vital element of
your life? Take some time this afternoon to consider your daily
activities. How often do you find yourself praying throughout the day?
As you study this week, think of ways to improve your prayer life, and
resolve that, with God's help, you will draw closer to Him through
prayer.

"TEACH US TO PRAY" (Luke 11:1-13).

  List at least three things you notice about the setting of this
parable. Luke 11:1-13.


   The disciples seemed to realize the importance of prayer in
establishing and maintaining a close relationship with God. In answer
to their request, Jesus instructed them by giving them a sample prayer
and telling them a parable.
    Jesus' sample prayer teaches us much about prayer. The order of
the prayer suggests that before we ask anything for ourselves, we first
should give God the glory due Him. When we do so, we will put other
items in their proper place.
    Notice how the prayer immediately goes from the heights of
adoration to the most basic of human needs. Jesus knows that we
cannot live by bread alone. But He also knows that we cannot live
without it. Thus He teaches us that He is concerned about our physical
well being and that it is proper for us to dialog with Him about it. This
particular request is also one of compassion. The plural pronouns us
and our imply that we should pray not only for personal needs but for
the needs of others, as well.

   Review the rest of Jesus' sample prayer by listing phrases of
the prayer that go with each item below.

   Prayer about past sin


   Prayer about one's relationship with others


   Prayer about future trials and protection


  "Truly to pray 'lead us not into temptation' is to renounce the ways of
our own choosing and to submit to the ways of God's choosing."
—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 348. Furthermore, temptation (KJV)
can mean any situation that tests our faith or challenges our principles.

    Use the elements of Jesus' sample prayer to compose your own
 prayer. Such an exercise can infuse new life into the sometimes all-
 too-familiar verses we have studied today. (1) Adoration/praise to
 God. (2) Our needs for the day. (3) Forgiveness of sin. (4) Our
 relationship with others. (5) God's care and protection.

                                                                      47

ASK, SEARCH, AND KNOCK (Luke 11:5-13).

   Immediately after Jesus gave the disciples a sample prayer, He
further instructed them by telling them a parable. Read Luke 11:5-8.
Several customs are apparent in these verses: (1) During hot weather,
people often traveled at night. This could explain the midnight hour.
(2) Hospitality was a sacred duty. But because just enough bread was
baked in the morning for one day's use, the friend could not fulfill this
duty. Thus he was faced with quite a predicament. (3) Doors were
usually left open during the day. But closing them in the evening
signaled the householder's desire not to be disturbed. Thus, it was
considered quite rude to knock on a closed door, unless the need was
crucial. (4) A Palestinian house was usually divided into two parts by
a low platform that comprised about one-third of the floor space. On
the platform sat a charcoal stove around which the entire family slept
on mats. If one person arose, it was likely that others would be
disturbed. Thus the friend felt he could not arise.

   Summarize three things this parable tells us about prayer. In
what way is the meaning of the parable similar to certain sections
of the Lord's Prayer? Luke 11:5-13.


   Christ is not saying that God is one from whom we must wring a
blessing. Instead, He is contrasting the householder with our heavenly
Father. He is saying, "If this irritable person will give whatever is
needed, how much more will your heavenly Father give?"
   But the central theme of the parable is "steadfastness in prayer.
The parable also defines the kind of requests for which our Lord
counsels steadfastness—prayers whose object is the blessing of
our fellow men and the extension of His kingdom."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 5, p. 790.

  Verses 9 and 10 state that if we ask, we will receive. Why is the
request of verse 13 vitally important?


   Verses 9 and 10 do not mean that whatever we ask for, God will
give us. But when we ask for the Holy Spirit to live in our hearts and
transform our lives, God will not refuse us. As the Holy Spirit
influences our lives, God's will becomes our will. When that happens,
our requests will be in line with God's desire for our lives.

    How would a modern parable about persistence in prayer
 read? Over what would you show insistence?

PERSISTENCE PAYS OFF (Luke 18:1-8).

   Read Luke 18:1-5 and decide upon one word or small phrase
that you think best describes (a) the widow, (b) the judge, and
(c) the point Jesus is trying to get across about the nature of
prayer.


    This description of a Mesopotamian court "room" helps us visualize
the parable better: "On a slightly raised dais at the further end sat the
kadi, or judge, half buried in cushions. Round him squatted various
secretaries and other notables. The populace crowded into the rest of the
hall, a dozen voices clamouring at once, each claiming that his cause
should be the first heard. The more prudent litigants joined not in the
fray, but held whispered communications with the secretaries, passing
bribes, euphemistically called fees, into the hands of one or another.
When the greed of the underlings was satisfied, one of them would
whisper to the kadi, who would promptly call such and such a case. It
seemed to be ordinarily taken for granted that judgment would go for the
litigant who had bribed highest. But meantime a poor woman on the
skirts of the crowd perpetually interrupted the proceedings with loud
cries for justice. She was sternly bidden to be silent, and reproachfully
told that she came there everyday. 'And so I will,' she cried out, 'till the
kadi hears me.' "—H. B. Tristram, Eastern Customs in Bible Lands
(London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1894), pp. 228, 229.
    Amid such a scene, hear the widow cry out, "Grant me justice
against my adversary" (Luke 18:3, NIV). But what chance did she
have against such a system? Even the Greek word for widow means
"forsaken" or "left empty."

   What prompted the judge to answer the widow's plea? Verses 4, 5.


   To "always pray and not give up" (verse 1, NIV) means that we
should always be quick to pray when the need arises, whether that
need be to praise and thank God, or to request special help and
guidance. But sometimes we all feel as powerless as the widow. Then
meditate upon Jesus in Gethsemane praying again and again (Matt.
26:36-44; Luke 22:39-43). And memorize Paul's counsel in
Ephesians 6:18.

   How can the widow's example encourage you to keep on
 praying? Think of one or two matters about which you are
 ready to give up praying. Then ask God to help you be as
 persistent as the widow. Never give up!

                                                                        49
Wednesday                                                August 6
A PRAYER FOR VINDICATION (Luke 17:20-34; 18:1-8).

   Jesus probably told the parable of the widow and the corrupt judge
as a follow-up to His sermon on last-day events in Luke 17:20-34,
where He dealt with falsehoods that could cause even His followers to
go astray. Thus, the parable of the widow and judge "applies
specifically to the experience of God's people in the last days . . . in
anticipation of the deception they must meet and the persecution they
must suffer."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 843. Thus the widow's
pleas for justice against her adversary (Luke 18:3) become our prayers
for vindication.

   Who is our adversary and the father of lies (John 8:44),
including the falsehoods Jesus mentioned in Luke 17:20-34?
1 Peter 5:8. (See also Zech. 3:1-4.) How does the parable reassure us
that God will indeed deliver us from our adversary? Luke 18:5-8.


   In the original language of 1 Peter 5:8, the adversary (antidikos) is
identified with the devil. The same word for adversary is used in
Luke 18:3.
   "The worse this judge appears, . . . the more does the voice of the
Saviour seem to say to us, 'Men ought always to pray, and not faint.' "
—Charles H. Spurgeon, The Miracles and Parables of Our Lord (Grand
Rapids, Mich.: Baker Book House, reprinted 1992), vol. 3, p. 439.
   "Will he keep putting them off?" (Luke 18:7, NIV). It often
seems to us that God delays His answers to our prayers. But all the
while He is actually working quickly, setting "in operation those
forces that will accomplish His good will for the 'elect,' and these
forces may be in operation long before the results become apparent.
Furthermore, God may at times delay 'avenging' His 'elect' in order
that those who are persecuting them may have time and opportunity to
repent. God loves the persecutors as well as the persecuted [see
2 Peter 3:9]."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 845.
   We should also remember that a delay can help us understand our
dependency upon Christ, an understanding that makes it possible for
God to work on our behalf. When you suffer injustice, remember the
widow's perseverence and the words of Peter in 1 Peter 2:20-24.

    The parable gives us hope and assurance. But it also gives us
 cause for self-examination. Will you pursue any of the false-
 hoods abounding in the last days? (Luke 17:20-34). Or, like the
 widow, will you pray for vindication until the need to do so no
 longer exists?

SWEET HOUR OF PRAYER (Ps. 5:1-3).

   One morning, Cynthia Coston, homemaker and mother of two young
boys, reviewed the activities she needed to accomplish that day. When
she realized she would need guidance in arranging her schedule, she
asked God for help. She writes, "When I allowed the sweetness of prayer
into my day, it seeped down through my busy activities and made the
duties seem more manageable. My outlook improved and the things I
didn't accomplish seemed less important."—Adapted from Among Friends,
Rose Otis, editor, pp. 344, 345.

   This week, our study of two parables has instructed us regard-
ing prayer. Today, we will consider what Scripture has to say
about various aspects of prayer. For each aspect, summarize what
the texts tell us about it.

The benefits of prayer. James 4:8; 5:16.


Conditions of answered prayer. 2 Chron. 7:14; Heb. 11:6;
1 John 5:14, 15.


What to pray for. Matt. 5:44; 26:41; 1 Tim. 2:1, 2; James 1:5;
5:13-16.


How to pray. Ps. 62:8; Matt. 6:7; Phil. 4:6.


   Matthew 22:37-40 tells us that "the whole Law and the Prophets"
depend upon the greatest command of loving God with all your heart,
soul, and mind, and a second command to love your neighbor as your-
self. But it is foolish to expect that we can love God so completely
without a personal knowledge of Him. How can we obtain such a
knowledge? The disciples guessed it when they asked Jesus, "Lord,
teach us to pray" (Luke 11:1). Thus, "Jesus gave His disciples a plan
through which they could love God and become an expression of His
love to their fellowmen. The method of Jesus for discipleship was to
teach men and women to pray. Prayer would usher them into a loving,
intimate relationship with the Father."—Sammy Tippit, The Prayer
Factor (Chicago, Ill.: The Moody Bible Institute, 1988), p. 67.

   Is the disciples' request yours? In what ways do you expect the
 Lord to answer you when you pray, "Lord, teach me to pray"?

                                                                    51
Friday                                                       August 8
FURTHER STUDY: Read the following prayers found in the Bible.
What prompted the people involved to pray? Where and how did they
pray? Did their lives meet the conditions of answered prayer? How did
their prayers compare with the principles behind the Lord's Prayer (see
Sunday's lesson)? 1 Sam. 1:8-20; 2:1-10; Dan. 9:1-23; John 17.

   Read any or all of the following: Steps to Christ, "The Privilege
of Prayer," pp. 93-104; Christ's Object Lessons, "Asking to Give,"
pp. 139-149; "Shall Not God Avenge His Own?" pp. 164-180.

   "The soul that turns to God for its help, its support, its power, by
daily, earnest prayer, will have noble aspirations, clear perceptions of
truth and duty, lofty purposes of action, and a continual hungering and
thirsting after righteousness. By maintaining a connection with God,
we shall be enabled to diffuse to others, through our association with
them, the light, the peace, the serenity, that rule in our hearts. The
strength acquired in prayer to God, united with persevering effort in
training the mind in thoughtfulness and care-taking, prepares one for
daily duties and keeps the spirit in peace under all circumstances."
—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 85.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. The disciples did not ask Jesus to teach them to work miracles,
     to heal, or to preach. Instead, they asked Him to teach them
     to pray. Before studying this lesson, what would you have
     asked Jesus to teach you? Why? How has this lesson changed
     your mind about what you would like to learn from Christ?

   2. Read Matthew 26:36-45. Contrast Christ's example with
      the disciples' actions. Why had the disciples failed to pray,
      even though earlier they had expressed a desire to learn to
      pray from the Master Himself? Why do you think we often
      fail to pray?

   3. Read Luke 6:12 and Mark 1:35. Is Jesus' example practical
      for us today? Why or why not? Should our lifestyle dictate
      our prayer life? Or should our prayer life dictate our
      lifestyle?

SUMMARY: Prayer is as important to our spiritual health as eating is
to our physical health. Just as it is essential to eat the right foods, so it
is essential for us to pray in the right way. Through daily heartfelt
prayer, both public and private, we draw closer to Christ, who then
infuses us with more of His love and grace.

    One Sabbath, I was preaching in a church in the city of Bauru,
                                                                     I
Brazil. As I preached on the seven great miracles of Jesus re-
corded in John's Gospel, I noticed a tall young woman sitting in
the front row, weeping. I was troubled over her tears, concerned
that I had said something to hurt her. At the end of the sermon, I
appealed to people to accept Jesus as their personal Saviour.
Many stood, including this girl. After the service she approached
me, her eyes filled with tears, and said, "I did not know Jesus
loved me so much. I want to be an Adventist." She told me a
little about herself, that her name was Ana Maria, and that she
was a basketball player. I promised to pray for her.
                                                                     i

                                                                     e
    "I do," I answered. "You are the basketball player."
    "No, Pastor, ex-basketball player; today I am an Adventist,
and I want you to baptize me."
    Ana Maria had gone through unpleasant situations in profes-
sional basketball, and while desperately searching for meaning
and happiness, she said that something—or Someone—spoke to
her of a God, but she wondered, "Will God accept me?"
    While in her mother's home in Bauru, a windstorm swept
through the area, destroying the house. No one was injured, but
 it was a traumatic experience. A group of young people helped
 the family and invited Ana Maria to attend a lecture as part of a
                                                                     S

spiritual retreat. Ana Maria accepted the invitation as a gesture
 of gratitude for what the young people had done for her mother.
    During the lecture, Ana Maria asked God to fill the void in
 her life. She said that her prayer was answered when she heard
 the news that Jesus' miracles showed His great love for her.
     I baptized Ana Maria, along with 14 other people, a few
 months later. Today Ana Maria is on Jesus' team in the great        0
 game of life. She wants to study theology and to be a Bible
 worker. And while she prepares for the theology course, Ana
 Maria is preparing others for baptism.                              r

               How Much Will
                 You Pay?




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Luke 14:7-11; 18:9-14;
Matt. 21:28-32.

   MEMORY TEXT: "All who exalt themselves will be
   humbled, but all who humble themselves will be exalted"
   (Luke 18:14, NRSV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Last week we learned how essential prayer is to
Christian growth. This week we will learn that pride is a malignancy that
surely will stunt that growth, if not destroy it altogether.

   LIFE'S MOST VALUABLE DISCOVERY. In 1847, Scotland's
Dr. James Simpson discovered that chloroform could be used as an
anaesthetic, making it possible for patients to have pain-free surgery.
Many doctors felt that this was one of the most important break-
throughs of medicine in their time.
   Years later, Dr. Simpson was lecturing at the University of Edinburgh.
A student asked him what he thought was the most valuable discovery
of his career. Of course, everyone expected Dr. Simpson to mention
chloroform. But he answered, "My most valuable discovery was when
I discovered myself a sinner and that Jesus Christ was my Saviour."
   Such an attitude of humility fosters Christian growth, while pride
will effectively stunt or destroy our spiritual development. This week,
the parables we will study give us an in-depth look at pride and the
price it exacts from those who are all too willing to pay. As you study,
remember that pride caused Lucifer's fall (Isa. 14:12-14; Eze. 28:11-19)
and is, therefore, the root of all sin. Also, consider how you would
have answered the student's question if you had been Dr. Simpson.

PRIDE'S FOCUS (Luke 18:9-14).

  What two characteristics did the people possess to whom Jesus
addressed the parable in Luke 18:9-14?


   Although verse 9 does not specify that Pharisees were present,
Jesus had them in mind when He told this parable. It was the Pharisee
in the story who epitomizes the two characteristics of the people
whom Jesus was addressing.
   "The Pharisaic, legalistic concept of righteousness operated on the
premise that salvation was to be earned by observing a certain pattern
of conduct, and gave little or no attention to the necessary devotion of
the heart to God and the transformation of man's motives and
objectives in life. . . . The concept that outward conformity to divine
requirements was all that God asked, irrespective of the motive that
prompted compliance with them, actuated their thinking and living."
—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 846.

  What was the focus of the Pharisee's world? What does this tell
us about his attitude toward himself, other people, and God?
Luke 18:10-12.


   "Two men went up into the temple to pray" (Luke 18:10). Every
day, there was time set aside for prayer during the morning and
evening sacrifices. People could also go to the temple at any time for
private prayer.
   "I fast twice in the week" (Luke 18:12). The Mosaic law did not
command fasting except for the Day of Atonement. But the Pharisees
fasted regularly (Matt. 6:16).
   How proud the Pharisee was of his own accomplishments in the
name of goodness! The frigid winds of pride swirled around him as he
stood alone upon his mountain of self-righteousness—alone because
pride needs no god or companion other than oneself. And therein lies
the sin of pride. It separates us from the only Source of true
righteousness and mercy, making it impossible for us to be merciful to
others. Unlike Dr. Simpson in Sabbath's lesson, the Pharisee had not
yet discovered that he was a sinner and that Jesus was his Saviour.

   How are you tempted to exalt yourself? What does it do to
 you when you contrast yourself with those upon whom you look
 down? If we are not aware that pride exists in our hearts, what
 can enable us to see ourselves as we really are?


                                                                    57

HUMILITY'S FOCUS (Luke 18:9-14).

   While the Pharisee was thought to represent the highest level of
holiness in Jewish society, the tax collector portrayed the lowest. Jews
ostracized those of their heritage who collected the Roman poll and
land taxes because paying the poll tax was a concession to Roman
overlordship, while paying the land tax was an insult to God, whom
they believed was the sole owner of the land. Tax collectors often took
more than the required taxes.
   Even though Jesus did not condone the behavior of most tax collec-
tors (Matt. 5:46, 47), He did spend time with them, thus inciting the
wrath of the Jewish authorities (Matt. 9:10-13; 11:19).

   After reading the tax collector's prayer, decide what was the
focus of his world. What does this tell us about his attitude toward
himself, others, and God? Luke 18:13.


   "Have mercy on me, a sinner" (Luke 18:13, NIV). Literally, the
sinner. The tax collector viewed himself as if he were the only sinner
(Compare 1 Tim. 1:15-17).
   Humility "is not so much a self-consciousness as a God-
consciousness; not so much a mean thinking of ourselves as a
thrilling, penetrating consciousness of him who is perfect holiness and
truth. . . . The publican felt God at his heart; and the sight awoke the
longing to be holy as God is, and the longing to be holy called out the
sense of wrongness. Oh, how he had offended! how selfish and
grasping and wicked he had been! All else fades into indistinctness; in
that temple there are to him but the two presences, God and his soul,
and the soul cries, 'God be merciful!' "—The Pulpit Commentary,
The Gospel According to St. Luke, vol. 1, p. 117.

  How would you describe the results of the two prayers? What
do these results teach us about the role of pride and humility in a
person's religious experience? Luke 18:14.


    "Justified" (Luke 18:14). This means declared righteous
 (Rom. 4:1-8) and made righteous in the sense of receiving the
 gift of the Spirit in the new-birth experience (Titus 3:5-7). "The
 publican knew himself to be a sinner (see v. 13), and this realiza-
 tion opened the way for God to pronounce him sinless—a sinner
 justified by divine mercy .... It was the attitudes of the two men
 toward themselves and toward God that made the difference."
 —SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 848.

WHEN YES MEANT NO (Matt. 21:28-33).

  Jesus tells another parable that deals with pride and the price it
exacts in Matthew 21:28-33. Why did Jesus relate this parable,
and to whom? Matt. 21:23-27, 31, 32.


   "By what authority are you doing these things?" (Matt. 21:23,
NIV). This is a reference to the events earlier in the week, which
included Jesus' triumphal entry (Matt. 21:1-11), the second cleansing
of the temple along with the healing of the sick (Matt. 21:12-16), and
His present teaching in the temple courts (Matt. 21:23).
    Centuries later, human nature has not changed, and there are still
some persons who dare to profess Jesus while questioning His
authority. To discover just how much a person pays for such an
attitude, examine more closely the words and behavior of the two sons
in the parable.

  If the two sons were yours, which one in the end would you be
most concerned about?


   False professions then. "The son who said, 'I go, sir,' represented
himself as faithful and obedient; but time proved that his profession
was not real. He had no true love for his father. So the Pharisees
prided themselves on their holiness, but when tested, it was found
wanting. . . . They had no true love for God or man. God called them to
be co-workers with Him in blessing the world; but while in
profession they accepted the call, in action they refused obedience."
—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 278, 279.
   False professions today. "Self-righteousness is not true righteous-
ness, and those who cling to it will be left to take the consequences of
holding a fatal deception. Many today claim to obey the command-
ments of God, but they have not the love of God in their hearts to flow
forth to others. Christ calls them to unite with Him in His work for the
saving of the world, but they content themselves with saying, 'I go,
sir.' . . . They are living a lie."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 279.
    People who display such an attitude are incapable of confessing
their sin, because they cannot recognize their need of Christ. As long
as they are so intent upon admiring themselves in the mirror of their
self-righteousness, they will be ill-equipped to heed Micah 6:8 and
Matthew 23:23.

    How will you answer the Saviour's call to work? What does
 the word today in Matthew 21:28 mean for your life?

                                                                    59
Wednesday                                                August 13
WHEN NO MEANT YES (Matt. 21:28-32).

   Yesterday we studied about the son who agreed to his father's
instructions in word only. Now we will consider the son who declined
his father's command, but later obeyed.

  Contrast the attitude and response of this son with the attitude
and response of his brother. Matt. 21:30.


   "Pride dies hard, but this son admitted his wrong without any attempt
at excuse. Then he went. Perhaps his work was not impressive, perhaps
his former insolence had impaired both his skill and his staying power.
But he did his best, and God reckoned the attempt for the deed."—The
Interpreter's Bible, vol. 7, p. 511. The laying aside of pride reflects
several promising qualities: (1) reflectiveness; (2) humility; (3) willing-
ness to admit wrong; and (4) a desire to do better.

  The son we studied yesterday represented the Pharisees. Whom
does this son represent, and why? Matt. 21:31, 32.


   Tax collectors and prostitutes symbolize all social and religious
outcasts. But Jesus states that there is more hope for people such as
these than there is hope for people who wrap their pride around them
like flamboyant scarves. Pride recognizes no need. But those who
recognize themselves as sinners realize they need a Saviour and
become dismayed at the thought of being eternally separated from
God. They respond to Him who has said, "Anyone who comes to me I
will never drive away" (John 6:37, NRSV).
   Pride corrodes. Beginning with its launch in 1938 until its
retirement 40 years later, the Queen Mary was the largest ship to
navigate the seas. During its conversion to a floating hotel and
museum in Long Beach, California, workers removed its three enor-
mous smokestacks in order to paint them. But as they began their task,
the stacks crumbled. All that remained were 30 coats of paint applied
over the decades. The 3/4-inch steel that had formed the stacks had
completely rusted away. The Pharisees' religion was much like those
smokestacks; their profession like the 30 coats of paint. Theirs was the
appearance of holiness. But pride had long ago rusted their substance.

    The parable of the two sons points out the choice the religious
 leaders had made about the gospel proclaimed by John the
 Baptist and Jesus. What choice have you made regarding this
 gospel? Which son are you?

PLACES OF HONOR (Luke 14:7-11; Matt. 23:1, 2, 6).

   As you read Luke 14:7-11, ask yourself when you might have
seen or heard someone trying to obtain "a place of honor." What
about human nature causes us to do so?


   As these verses suggest, a parable need not necessarily be a story.
Obviously, Jesus based His words of advice on what He saw take
place before His very eyes (Luke 14:7). But His words for the time
being apparently had little effect, for even at the Last Supper the
disciples abandoned their Leader's advice for the sake of arguing
about who among them was the most distinguished (Luke 22:24).
   The place of honor (Luke 14:8, NIV). Jewish tradition stated that
places of honor were those closest to the host.
   "The usual law of life is to use our invitations and our social clout
to acquire friends and prestige. We want to put in our debt those who
can enhance our social and business status."—Bruce Larson,
The Communicator's Commentary: Luke (Waco, Tex.: Word Books,
1983), p. 220.
    Immediately after telling the parable, Jesus instructed His host not
to invite to dinner only people who could repay the favor. Instead, He
declared that he also should invite those who could not repay. Notice
that the people Jesus mentioned should be invited were social
outcasts; people who, due to their station in life, needed some
assistance; people who could not clamor for the places of honor.
    Attitudes of pride and humility are best witnessed in how we treat
other people, especially those people upon whom society often frowns.
While pride motivates us to seek the pleasure and profit we can obtain
only from the popular and prestigious, humility urges us "to
remember that God sees mankind as one family, and that his love runs
most quickly to the neediest."—The Interpreter's Bible, vol. 8, p. 254.

   How does James present Jesus' teaching on pride? James 2:1-5.


    How can we obtain and retain humility? First of all, consider
 the facts: any one of us actually knows very little compared with
 the sum of all knowledge; and however important we believe
 ourselves to be, life existed before we were born and will go on
 without us when we die. Second, meditate upon Christ's example
 of humility as described in 1 Peter 2:21-25. (Compare Luke 14:11.)
 Behold Him dying on the cross. He died for you. Third, communi-
 cate with Jesus, asking Him to change your attitude from love for
 self to supreme love for Him and for your fellow humans.

                                                                    61
Friday                                                  August 15
FURTHER STUDY: Contrast the disciples' pride with Jesus' humility
as displayed at the Last Supper. John 13:1-17; Luke 22:24-27. How did
Paul, a once proud person himself, reinforce Christ's example of
humility? Rom. 12:10; Gal. 5:26; 6:14; Eph. 4:1-6; Phil. 2:3, 4.

  Read Christ's Object Lessons, "Saying and Doing," pp. 272-283;
"Two Worshipers," pp. 150-163.

    "Christ would have His disciples understand that although He had
washed their feet, this did not in the least detract from His dignity. 'Ye
call me master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.' And being so
infinitely superior, He imparted grace and significance to the service.
No one was so exalted as Christ, and yet He stooped to the humblest
duty. That His people might not be misled by the selfishness which
dwells in the natural heart, and which strengthens by self-serving,
Christ Himself set the example of humility. He would not leave this
great subject in man's charge. Of so much consequence did He regard
it, that He Himself, One equal with God, acted as servant to His
disciples. While they were contending for the highest place, He to
whom every knee shall bow, He whom the angels of glory count it
honor to serve, bowed down to wash the feet of those who called Him
Lord. He washed the feet of His betrayer."—The Desire of Ages,
p. 649.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Contrast Lucifer's desire for equality with God (Isa. 14:
     12-14; Eze. 28:11-19) with Christ's thoughts on the subject
     (Phil. 2:6-8).

   2. After studying this week's lesson, what would you say pride
      costs? (Consider the origins of pride, what needs to be done
      about it, and the expense involved to the individual, the
      church, the Godhead, and society.)

   3. In Luke 14:13, Christ instructed His host also to "invite the
      poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind" (NIV). How do
      you feel about following these instructions? What do these
      instructions suggest about church membership?

SUMMARY: Pride is a cancer that hinders us from enjoying a
meaningful relationship with Christ. It prevents us from making the
most valuable discovery of all—that the only place of honor worth
having is beside our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ.

       The young man walked to the front of the room, then spoke. "I
   am Valery Starchenko," he began. "You would not have wanted
   to know me a year ago. I drank and smoked and spent my time and
   money on selfish pleasures. I had no interest in God." He hesi-
   tated again, seemingly reluctant to continue.
      "Two years ago my wife became a Christian. I was angry.
   When I came home drunk, I often heard her say my name in
   prayer. 'Dear Lord, please help Valery to accept Jesus as his
   Savior. I love him and want him to experience the peace and joy
   You have given me.'
       "At first her prayers angered me. I was an atheist. I wanted only to
   make money and have a good time. Religion was not for me."

   said. "I saw that my wife was kind and forgiving, but I was cruel.
   I began to repent of the evil I had done to her, and I asked her
   forgiveness.

           Serving the Master




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 25:14-30; Luke 16:1-9.

   MEMORY TEXT: "And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to
   the Lord and not to men, knowing that from the Lord you will
   receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord
   Christ" (Colossians 3:23, 24, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Part of being transformed by Christ and
growing in grace through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit means that
we will become active members of society, attracting others to the
Saviour as we use our talents and gifts in service to the world.

   WHAT ARE YOU DOING? During one summer, a pastor visited
a woman who had a magnificent collection of rose bushes. She took
him out into her yard to see them—white roses, red roses, yellow
roses, climbing roses. She had every species he had heard of and a
great many he had never heard of.
   The woman began plucking roses right and left. Even when a bush
had only one rose on it, she picked it. The pastor remonstrated, "You
are robbing yourself, dear lady; you are spoiling your rose bushes."
   "Ah," she said, don't you know that the way to make the rosebush
flourish is to pluck its flowers freely? I lose nothing by what I give
away."
   This is a universal law. We don't lose by giving; we increase our
capacity to give.
   This week in our study of Christian growth, we will discuss the
stewardship of our lives as God's children. We will examine, among
other things, the purpose and results of such stewardship.

  When did Jesus tell His disciples the parable of the talents, and
why? Matt. 24:3, 42.


   "Christ on the Mount of Olives had spoken to His disciples of His
second advent to the world. He had specified certain signs that were to
show when His coming was near, and had bidden His disciples watch
and be ready. . . . Then He showed what it means to watch for His
coming. The time is to be spent, not in idle waiting, but in diligent
working. This lesson He taught in the parable of the talents."—Christ 's
Object Lessons, p. 325.
   Christ was telling His disciples that soon He would be going back
to heaven. But while they were waiting for Him to return, they were to
continue their work on His behalf.

   In the parable, the master gave a different amount of talents to
each servant (Matt. 25:14, 15). What about the Christian life does
this symbolize? Does it mean that God "plays favorites"?


   What if God had made only one type of flower, one species of
animal, one source of light? How interesting or practical would this
world be if we were all the same?
   God values variety for its beauty, as well as for its usefulness. Some
of us are architects. We know how to draw plans for a church. Some of us
are skilled craftspersons. We turn the blueprints into wood and stone.
Others come along to fill the finished structure with word and song. The
janitor, the painter, the gardener who brings flowers, and many with
other talents—all the gifts of all the church members are needed! There
is only one common element: God has given all of us at least one gift
necessary to both the growth and maintenance of His church.
    The master's reaction to what each of his servants did with the
talents assures us that God is indeed impartial. When the master
returned, he did not condemn the man who had only two talents for
still having fewer talents than the servant who started out with five.
Instead, he congratulated them both for being faithful. Notice also that
the reward he gave each was the same (Matt. 25:21, 23). Likewise,
God does not view us merely in light of what we can do, but whether
or not we do what we can.

    How can God's impartiality help you to view others you think
 are more talented than you? How can it help you to use faith-
 fully the talent or talents God has given you?

                                                                     65

THE SERVANTS (Matt. 25:14-30).

   Yesterday in our study of the parable of the talents, we concen-
trated on the master. Today we will take a closer look at the three
servants.

   What can you conclude about each servant's relationship with
the master? Matt. 25:20, 22, 24, 25. How did their relationship
affect their behavior? Matt. 25:16-18.


   Our relationship with Jesus is the essence of our Christian service.
We can be effective servants only as we trust Him to (1) forgive us of
our sins and (2) empower us through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit
to display His love and concern for other people.
   The servant with one talent did not view his master as a "hard man"
because the master truly was such, but because the servant did not
truly know the master. The servant was motivated not by a desire to
serve well or to please his master, but by his fear of failure
(Matt. 25:25). Such fear paralyzes us from doing our best. Indeed, as
we learn from the parable, it prevents us from even trying.
   Contrast the third servant's attitude with David's words in Psalm
119:76, 77: "May your unfailing love be my comfort, according to
your promise to your servant. Let your compassion come to me that I
may live, for your law is my delight" (NIV). When the Word lives in
our hearts (Ps. 119:11; John 1:1, 9, 12, 13), service on His behalf
becomes a pleasure. Any fear of failure will evaporate along with
concern for the number of talents God has given us.

  If you had been the third servant, how would you have felt
about receiving only one talent?


    "However small your talent, God has a place for it. That one talent,
wisely used, will accomplish its appointed work. By faithfulness in
little duties, we are to work on the plan of addition, and God will work
for us on the plan of multiplication. These littles will become the most
precious influences in His work.
    "Let a living faith run like threads of gold through the performance
of even the smallest duties. Then all the daily work will promote
Christian growth."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 360.

    How does your relationship with God affect your attitude
 toward what you do? How can you faithfully improve the talent
 or talents God has given you?

THE TALENTS (Matt. 25:14-30).

   The master, the servants, the talents. Christ, ourselves, and the
abilities God has given each one of us that we are to use in service for
Him. So far this week, we have concentrated on the characters in the
parable of the talents. Today we will discuss the talents themselves.
   The term talent first referred to a unit of weight, then to a unit of
coinage. Modern use of the term to indicate an ability or gift stems
from the parable.

   Below is a list of talents or gifts. Describe how each might be
used for the growth and maintenance of God's church. Can you
think of others?

 intellectual abilities

 organizational skills

 speech

 time

  money

  influence


   Influence "is a responsibility from which we cannot free ourselves.
Our words, our acts, our dress, our deportment, even the expression of
the countenance, has an influence. Upon the impression thus made
there hang results for good or evil which no man can measure."
—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 339, 340.

   What does the parable of the talents tell us about the relation-
ship between the use of our talents and Christian growth?


  Do you think of yourself as a five-talent person, a two-talent
person, or a one-talent person? Explain.


    How can you put to better use the talents God has given you?

                                                                     67

WHICH MASTER WILL YOU SERVE? (Luke 16:1-9).

    We read of people "subordinating the eternal to the temporal, the
claims of the future to the affairs of the present"; people "mistaking
phantoms for realities, and realities for phantoms"; refusing to view
the unseen world by faith while greedily viewing "the things of this
life as all-attractive and all-absorbing." (See Christ's Object Lessons,
p. 366.) Do you know people like this? The next parable we will
discuss tells how the attitudes of such people affect the stewardship of
their lives on Christ's behalf. We will meet a dishonest manager who
abused his position and defrauded his employer, and hopefully learn a
lesson from his behavior that will help us concentrate on things that
draw us closer to our Saviour.

   To whom did Jesus address this parable, and why? Luke 16:1,14.


   Jesus presented this parable "directly to the disciples."—Christ's
Object Lessons, p. 368. It was a few months before the end of His
earthly ministry. As the grip of His "last-day events" took hold
upon the disciples, they would need to remember that their devo-
tion to Him must be single-minded. When Jesus spoke the words
in verse 13, perhaps He even had in mind the disciple who would
betray his Master to the authorities for 30 pieces of silver—the
price of a slave.

   "The master commended the dishonest manager" (Luke 16:8,
NIV). It "is apparent that Jesus found in the rich man's commendation
of his steward something useful in teaching a lesson to the disciples
and to the listening audience. . . . The cleverness with which this
scheming rascal brought his career of misconduct to a climax was so
amazing, and the thoroughness with which he carried out his plan so
worthy of more noble objectives, that the rich man could not help
admiring his steward's sharpness and diligence."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 5, p. 826.

  Compare the unfaithful manager with the one-talent servant in
Matthew 25:14-30. Which "masters" did they serve? What effect
does each of these "masters" have on one's service for the Lord?


   In these last days, what prevents you from working single-
 mindedly for Christ? List some things you can do to concentrate
 more on Christ and His service.

CREATIVE MANAGING (Luke 16:1-15).

   Yesterday we began discussing the parable of the unfaithful man-
ager. Below, list the four lessons this parable teaches. How does each
lesson relate to the stewardship of our lives as growing Christians?

   Verse 8


   Verse 9


   Verses 10, 11


   Verse 13


    "Use worldly wealth to gain friends" Luke 16:9, NIV. "We are
to use the material things entrusted to us to advance the interests of
our Father in heaven, by applying them to the needs of our fellow men
(Prov. 19:17; Matt. 19:21; 25:31-46; Luke 12:33) and to the advance-
ment of the gospel (1 Cor. 9:13; 2 Cor. 9:6, 7)."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 5, p. 827.
    Faithfulness in small matters. People, cities, countries enjoy boasting
about their best features, their largest building, their most powerful
weapon of destruction, etc. But this parable tells us what greatness
really is. It is "not the size of the means, but the intensity of the need
to which it ministers. A lantern of itself is a small affair, but not when
it shines to mark a harbor for some lost ship. A cup of cold water is
almost trivial, but not to a man dying of thirst in a desert. What makes
greatness? Not the measure of man's body or even of his mind, but his
willingness to work in double yoke with Jesus."—The Interpreter's
Bible, vol. 8, p. 285.

   Which of the four lessons above are the most meaningful to you
at this point in your life?


   How can you use material possessions to advance the gospel?


   What small thing can you do for someone today that would
 make a great difference in that person's life?


                                                                       69
Friday                                                  August 22
FURTHER STUDY: Think about the following people in the Bible.
What gift or talent did each one receive from God? What was the
outcome of their use or abuse of that gift or talent? What does that
outcome teach us about stewardship and the growth of the Christian
life? Dorcas (Acts 9:36-43); Mary, the sister of Lazarus (John 12:1-8);
Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5:1-11); Joseph (Gen. 39-41).

  Read one or both of the following chapters from Christ's Object
Lessons: "Talents," pp. 325-365; "Friends by the Mammon of
Unrighteousness," pp. 366-375.

   "Whether we recognize it or not, we are stewards, supplied from
God with talents and facilities, and placed in the world to do a work
appointed by Him.
   "To every man is given 'his work' (Mark 13:34), the work for
which his capabilities adapt him, the work which will result in greatest
good to himself and to his fellow men, and in greatest honor to God.
   "Thus our business or calling is a part of God's great plan, and, so
long as it is conducted in accordance with His will, He Himself is
responsible for the results. . . . Thus there is no place for anxious
care."--Education, pp. 137, 138.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What specific gifts has God given the Seventh-day
     Adventist in particular? What is the corporate role in using
     these gifts for the advancement of the gospel and service to
     humanity? What is the individual church member's role?

   2. After studying this lesson, do you think that faithful stew-
      ardship regarding one's talents and gifts is essential to Chris-
      tian growth? Why?

   3. List the talents and gifts possessed by each member of your
      Sabbath School class. Discuss ways in which your class as a
      unit can use these gifts in service for God. Then carefully
      plan to put at least one of these ways into action.

SUMMARY: As Jesus' followers, under His direction, become faith-
ful stewards of their gifts and talents, they will attract others to Him.
Thus the church as a unit and members as individuals will grow
stronger in the Christian graces.

    Yaheya Nomao (YAY-ee-yah No-MAH-o) was a Muslim hired
to help with an ADRA literacy program set up among the Touareg
people, wandering nomads who live in the southern portions of
the Sahara Desert in West Africa. As a conscientious Muslim, he
had many questions about religion. Yaheya prayed to Allah, the
Creator God of Islam, to show the way to full salvation. Yaheya
searched for answers inside and outside his Muslim faith. He
visited several Christian churches, but he was not satisfied. Then
a friend introduced him to Zacharie, a young Muslim man who
now worshiped the Christian God and had returned to his home-
town to preach.
    Yaheya and another friend, Alio (AH-lee-oh) soon began studying
eternal truths with Zacharie. After many weeks of Bible study,
the men were convinced that Allah had answered their prayers
and had directed them to Zacharie.
    Yaheya and Alio began to share with others what God had done
for them. In time, Zacharie invited a pastor to travel to Tahoua and
conduct a stop-smoking plan and a short evangelistic program. In the
past, evangelical pastors had encountered fierce opposition from the
Islamic community. But the villagers had heard Yaheya and Alio's
testimony, and more than 300 persons attended the meetings. The
pastor used the Taurat, the Muslim equivalent to the first five books
of the Bible, to present basic Christian truths. Presentations were
made on areas of Christian living that Adventists and Muslims have
in common. More than 100 young people stayed for the question-
and-answer period each night.
    Yaheya and Alio committed their lives to Christ and were
baptized, the first Adventists in this area of Muslim-dominated
Niger. Alio is preparing to teach. When he finishes, he will return
 to lead the literacy program in his home area and become a lay
 evangelist to his own people. Yaheya has built a small straw hut
 in his yard where he holds Bible studies and witnesses to his
 family and friends.
     Pray for Yaheya and Alio, true pioneer missionaries among
 their people. Thousands like Yaheya and Alio are praying to
 "Allah" for a knowledge of the true "Way, the Truth, and the
 Life." And pray for the desert people of West Africa who, for the
 first time, have an opportunity to hear the everlasting gospel.

                        True Love




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Luke 10:25-37.

     MEMORY TEXT: " 'You shall love the Lord your God with all
     your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all
     your mind'; and 'your neighbor as yourself' " (Luke 10:27, NKJV).

    KEY THOUGHT: Growing in grace enables Christians to react to
fellow humans with compassion, regardless of race, gender, or beliefs.

   NO LONGER ENEMIES. During the American Revolution,
Peter Miller enjoyed the friendship of General George Washington.
But the same could not be said regarding his relationship with Michael
Wittman, a nasty sort of person who took great delight in opposing
and humiliating Miller at every turn.
   One day Wittman was arrested for treason and sentenced to death.
Upon hearing the news, Miller walked 70 miles to plead with
Washington for Wittman's life.
   "No!" Washington insisted. "I cannot pardon your friend."
   "My friend!" exclaimed Miller. "He's my worst enemy!"
   "You've just walked 70 miles to plead for the life of an enemy?"
Washington cried. He was so impressed by Miller's gesture that he
granted the pardon. Later, Miller took Wittman back home—no longer
a foe, but a friend.—Adapted from Larson, Illustrations for Preaching
and Teaching, p. 142.
   In Luke 10, Jesus tells a similar story. As you study Jesus' answer,
ask the Holy Spirit to help you determine which character in the story
you most resemble.

COLORFUL CHARACTERS AND ROCKY ROADS (Luke 10:25-30).

  Why did Jesus tell the parable of the good Samaritan?
Luke 10:25-29.


   Being an expert in the law, the lawyer knew the answer to his first
question (Luke 10:25-27). But because he held the popular belief that
the heathen and Samaritans were not "neighbors," he really wanted to
know, "Which of my fellow Israelites are my neighbors?" Rabbis,
priests, and elders engaged in endless ceremonies to purify
themselves. Associating with the masses of their people caused defile-
ment that dictated tiring effort to erase. Thus the question of whether
or not they should consider these "unclean" Hebrews as their
neighbors caused continual debate.
   The parable itself is full of colorful characters and action. Even the
setting is intriguing—the dangerous road between Jerusalem and
Jericho. Because Jerusalem is 2,300 feet above sea level and Jericho
1,300 feet below sea level, this road is rather steep. In fact, in less than
20 miles, it drops 3,600 feet! Add to that its numerous rocky and
narrow passageways, and you have excellent hideaways for bandits to
lurk behind while they await their prey.
   In the nineteenth century, travelers still paid safety money to the
local sheiks to travel it. And in the 1930s, H. V. Morton related that
someone warned him to get home before dark because a certain thief
had gained his reputation by highjacking cars, robbing the occupants,
and escaping into the hills before the authorities could arrive.
   The evidence suggests that Jesus was describing an actual
 occurrence. (See The Desire of Ages, p. 499.)

   List the six characters in the parable, describing their role.

   3.
   4.

   6.

    Consider the steep and rocky roads of life that you must

ABUSE AND NEGLECT (Luke 10:30-33).

   Yesterday, you were to list the six characters in the parable of the
good Samaritan. Today and the rest of the week, we will take a closer
look at the role each played regarding the meaning of the parable.

  The first person to appear on the scene is the victim (Luke
10:30). Based on what you learned yesterday about the road he
was traveling, why was he taking a great risk?


  The thieves are the next people we meet, and because they acted as
one, we will consider them as "one" character. By taking the victim's
possessions, robbing him of his clothes, and beating him until he was
nearly dead, they displayed a lack of respect not only for a fellow
human, but for themselves, as well.

  What laws were the priest and Levite probably considering as
they saw the helpless victim? Num. 19:11; Lev. 21:1-4. What
admonition were they ignoring? Micah 6:8.


   "He [the priest] could not be sure but he feared that the man was
dead; to touch him would mean losing his turn of duty in the Temple;
and he refused to risk that. He set the claims of ceremonial above
those of charity. The Temple and its liturgy meant more to him than
the pain of man."—William Barclay, The Gospel of Luke, p. 139.
   "Came and looked on him" (Luke 10:32). Thus the King James
Version implies that the Levite was perhaps a bit more interested in
the victim's welfare than the priest. But he also "passed by on the
other side." Maybe he too was concerned with the disruption that
contamination would bring to his life. In addition to this, both the
priest and the Levite were probably aware that bandits often used a
member of their gang as a decoy to play the part of a wounded
traveler. Then, when an unsuspecting person stopped to help, the other
gang members would overpower him. The motto "Safety first" there-
fore could have been another factor in their decision to keep going.

  Do you know people who are in difficult situations because of
something they did or did not do? How can you help people who
are victims of their own carelessness?


   Can helping people sometimes enable them to continue with
 destructive behaviors? Explain.

THE HATED HELPS (Luke 10:33-35).

   Imagine the victim's plight, drifting in and out of consciousness,
perhaps long enough each time to realize that even "religious" men
were not stopping to help him. Surely after the Levite passed by, hope
did so, as well. But then the unexpected happened, a Samaritan took
pity upon him.
   Good Hebrews had shunned the Samaritans ever since the days of
Ezra, when the Samaritans began intermarrying with pagans during
the Assyrian and Babylonian conquests. (See 2 Kings 17:24-41.) The
Samaritans built a rival temple on Mount Gerizim, and they accepted
only the first books of the Bible. Thus the Hebrew people viewed the
Samaritan religion as impure. You can review the trouble the Samari-
tans caused the Jews by reading Ezra 4 and Nehemiah 2, 4, and 6.

   List at least four specific ways in which the Samaritan helped
the victim. Luke 10:34, 35. What does the nature of the Samaritan's
assistance teach us about what it means to "take pity" on
someone?


   "The fact that the Samaritan was traveling in what was to him a
foreign district made his deed of mercy even more noteworthy. In this
district it would be likely that the unfortunate wayfarer was a Jew, a
member of the race that cherished the most bitter enmity against the
Samaritans. The Samaritan knew well that if he had been the wounded
victim lying beside the road he could have expected no mercy from
any ordinary Jew. However, the Samaritan, at considerable risk to
himself from the attacks of robbers, determined to help the poor
victim."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 783.

  The innkeeper does not figure as prominently in the story as the
other characters do. But judging from the request of the
Samaritan in Luke 10:35, what can we assume about him?


   We can well reason that the Samaritan and innkeeper knew each
other. The innkeeper's willingness to allow the victim to remain at his
establishment based on the Samaritan's promise of reimbursement,
plus the Samaritan's willingness to leave the victim in the innkeeper's
care implies a certain level of trust toward each another.

    The Samaritan asked the innkeeper to help care for the
 injured man. How eagerly do you respond when someone asks
 you to assist a person in need?

                                                                    75
Wednesday                                             August 27
"WHO IS MY NEIGHBOUR?" (Luke 10:27, 29, 36, 37).

   This week the parable of the good Samaritan has taught us that
(1) we must help people who are victims of circumstances beyond
their control, as well as those who seem to have brought their troubles
on themselves (Monday's lesson), and (2) the help we give must be
practical, not a mere feeling sorry for them (Tuesday's lesson). True
compassion brings forth kind deeds.
   But what about the answer to the lawyer's question, "Who is my
neighbour?" (Luke 10:29)? Remember that he already believed the
Samaritans and heathen could not be so. What he really wanted to
know was who of the Jewish people should he consider his neighbors.

   After carefully reviewing the parable and the previous days'
lessons, answer the lawyer's question using your own words.


   The parable also graphically portrays the meaning of Luke 10:27.
(See also Deut. 6:5; Lev. 19:18.) Judging from the parable, what does
it mean to "love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all
your soul and with all your strength"? (Deut. 6:5, NIV).

     How do we love our neighbor as ourselves?


    It is the natural order of things always to seek our own good first.
And that is how we are to love our neighbors—by seeking their good
first. The priest and Levite put their "needs" ahead of the victim's by
being concerned only for their personal security and ritual cleanliness.
But the Samaritan, without considering his own safety, stopped to
assist a critically wounded man, someone who could even have been
his enemy. Without reservation regarding the victim's status in life,
without the assurance that the man would recover, he gave of his own
resources to care for him.

   Matthew 28:18-20 is known as the Christian's great commis-
sion. What other commission do we receive in Luke 10:37? How
do the two commissions relate to each other? How can you "go
and do likewise" today?


    "Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is
 this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep
 oneself from being polluted by the world" (James 1:27, NIV).

THE UNEXPECTED GOOD SAMARITAN (Phil. 2:4-8).

   As part of our study of Luke 10:25-37, we took note of each of the
characters in the parable. Today, we will study in even more detail the
Samaritan.

  Review again the Samaritan's actions. Whom does he
symbolize? Phil. 2:4-8.


   "In a very real way the mercy exhibited by the Samaritan reflects
the spirit that moved the Son of God to come to this earth to rescue
humanity. God was not obliged to rescue fallen man. He might have
passed sinners by, as the priest and the Levite passed the luckless
traveler on the road to Jericho. But the Lord was willing to be 'treated
as we deserve, that we might be treated as He deserves' (DA 25)."
—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, pp. 783, 784.

  In Tuesday's lesson, you listed ways in which the Samaritan
helped the victim. Compare each item on your list with what
Christ does for you as a sinner.


   Christ was the unexpected good Samaritan to Zacchaeus, Bartimaeus,
Mary Magdalene, the hungry crowd, the centurian, a dead girl, a sick
woman, and Saul of Tarsus (see Matt. 8:5-13; 9:18-26; Mark 10:
46-52; Luke 8:1, 2; 19:1-9; John 6:1-13; Acts 9:1-31). Can you think
of others?
   "Our Saviour manifested for us a love that the love of man can
never equal. When we were bruised and dying, He had pity upon us.
He did not pass us by on the other side, and leave us, helpless and
hopeless, to perish. He did not remain in His holy, happy home, where
He was beloved by all the heavenly host. He beheld our sore need, He
undertook our case, and identified His interests with those of
humanity. He died to save His enemies. He prayed for His murderers.
Pointing to His own example, He says to His followers, 'These things
I command you, that ye love one another'; 'as I have loved you, that
ye also love one another.' John 15:17; 13:34."—Christ's Object
Lessons, pp. 381, 382.

   How has Christ been an unexpected good Samaritan to you?
 Thank Him now for His wonderful gift of salvation and the
 many other ways He has shown compassion toward you. Ask
 Him to help you share His compassion with others, regardless of
 who they might be.

                                                                     77

FURTHER STUDY: Compare the rich young ruler of Matthew 19:16-
22 with the lawyer, the priest, and the Levite in the parable of the good
Samaritan. Also read 1 John 3:11-20 and Matthew 5:43-48.

   Read one or all of the following: Christ's Object Lessons, "Who
Is My Neighbor?" pp. 376-389; The Desire of Ages, "The Good
Samaritan," pp. 497-505.

   "Love is the basis of godliness. Whatever the profession, no man
has pure love to God unless he has unselfish love for his brother. But
we can never come into possession of this spirit by trying to love
others. What is needed is the love of Christ in the heart. When self is
merged in Christ, love springs forth spontaneously. The completeness
of Christian character is attained when the impulse to help and bless
others springs constantly from within.
   "Whatever the difference in religious belief, a call from suffering
humanity must be heard and answered. Where bitterness of feeling
exists because of difference in religion, much good may be done by
personal service. Loving ministry will break down prejudice, and win
souls to God."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 384, 386.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Describe the Samaritan's actions from the point of view of
     (a) personal inconvenience, (b) financial cost, and (c) risk.
     How much of a factor is each of these in discouraging your
     own neighborly actions?

     2. Sabbath morning, Michael and Beth are ready to leave for
        church when a distraught neighbor appears at the door
        asking to use their telephone because her son, who is prone
        to outbursts of rage, has just torn hers from its outlet.
        Should they (a) show her where their phone is, then politely
        excuse themselves and leave for church? (b) tell her they
        are in a hurry to leave, but the neighbors across the street
        are home? (c) let her use their phone and stay with her until
        help arrives?

SUMMARY: The parable of the good Samaritan not only teaches us
that true religion involves compassionate deeds to whomever is in
need, but it also reminds us of the extent of Christ's love toward us.

      "[Women] can do a work in families that men cannot
    do. . . . They can come close to the hearts of those whom men
    cannot reach." (Manuscript Releases, vol. 21, p. 30).

         In Central Malawi, a young wife lived a miserable life as a
    prisoner in her own home. Her husband would not allow her to
    leave the house, and no one was permitted to visit her at home.
         One day Mrs. E. G. Malopa, a pastor's wife, felt impressed to
    visit this woman. She found the young woman alone and was
    invited in. The young wife seemed nervous and kept watching the
    doorway, fearful that her husband might come home and chase
    Mrs. Malopa away. But the Lord kept the husband away, and the
    two women visited for more than an hour. During that time, the
    young wife shared the pain and stress that her husband's actions
    caused her.
         Mrs. Malopa encouraged the young wife to trust the Lord, who
    could change her husband's heart if she asked Him. The women
    made a covenant with God. The young woman would set aside an
    offering of 50 kwacha (about $3.75) as a sacrifice of thanksgiving
    to the Lord, and the two women would pray for the husband
    throughout the following week. Then the wife would ask her
    husband to allow her to go to church.
         On Friday, the young wife timidly approached her husband.
    Too afraid to ask to go to church, she asked if he would allow a
    friend to come to their home so he could meet her. To her sur-
    prise, he agreed. Excited, she sent an urgent message asking Mrs.
     Malopa to come quickly. "My husband wants to meet you. God
    has heard our prayers."
         Mrs. Malopa hurried to the woman's home, where the couple
     met her at the door. After a pleasant visit the man said, "I am
    delighted to have met you. Feel free to come to our house any-
     time. It would please me if my wife could attend the church where
     you pray, because you will be there with her."
         Today, this wife participates in many activities of the church. Her
     husband even provides transportation for the women when they need
     it. Now when Mrs. Malopa visits in their home, the husband insists
     that she pray before leaving, that God will bless their home. Join these
     two women in prayer for the husband's conversion.

       "To Forgive is Divine"




Sabbath Afternoon

READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matthew 18:21-35.

   MEMORY TEXT: "Bear with each other and forgive whatever
   grievances you may have against one another. Forgive as the
   Lord forgave you" (Colossians 3:13, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: The concept of forgiveness is crucial to
Christianity. Without it there would be no such religion. Growing in
grace enables Christians to forgive people who have harmed them,
regardless of the offense.

    COULD YOU BE THIS FORGIVING? The Norwegian writer
Johan Bojer in The Great Hunger tells of a man whose child was
killed by a neighbor's dog. Because he was not a vengeful person, the
father found another means of relieving his grief. When a famine laid
the neighbor's field bare and he had no corn to plant for the next
year's harvest, the father went out one night and sowed the neighbor's
field, explaining: "I sowed seed in my enemy's field that God might
exist."—Adapted from A Treasury of Sermon Illustrations, Charles L.
Wallis, ed. (New York: Abingdon-Cokesbury Press, 1950), p. 126.
   God will continue to exist despite anyone's ability or inability to
forgive. But when we forgive another person, He will dwell not only
in the heart of the person who forgives, but in the heart of the person
being forgiven. This week we will study a parable of Jesus that deals
with the importance of the difficult act of forgiving. Pray that the
Holy Spirit will teach you how to forgive even that person who has
hurt you the most.

WHAT IS FORGIVENESS? (Isa. 43:25; Micah 7:19).

   Let's consider the nature of forgiveness. The words forgive and
forgiveness are translations of Greek and Hebrew words "which have
in common the idea of releasing an offender from guilt and of restor-
ing the personal relationship that existed prior to the offense."
—SDA Bible Dictionary (revised edition), p. 388. The two most
common Hebrew words mean "to take away [guilt]," "to lift up," "to
pardon," and "to forgive." The most common Greek words mean "to
give graciously [as a favor]," "to cancel," "to let go," and "to send
away." The Greek word for forgiveness used in Luke 4:18 and
Colossians 1:14 (aphesis) means "release from captivity."

   Who is involved in the process of forgiving? Matt. 6:12.


   All of us have sinned against God (Rom. 3:23) and stand before
Him condemned to death unless we repent (Rom. 6:23; Luke 13:3, 5;
Acts 3:19). When we ask, we obtain forgiveness and are restored to a
right relationship with God (1 John 1:9; Rom. 5:1).
   "God is not obliged to forgive the guilty sinner, but His gracious
character impels Him to do so whenever forgiveness is desired and
requested (Ex 34:6, 7; Lam 3:22). The request, however, must be
made in all sincerity and with the intent not to take advantage of the
grace thus freely bestowed. When God forgives He does so
completely and without reserve, restoring the sinner to the same state
of favor he formerly enjoyed and removing all estrangement and
alienation."—SDA Bible Dictionary, p. 388.

   How do the following texts describe God's forgiveness?

   Micah 7:19

   Ps. 103:12

   Isa. 38:17

   Jer. 31:34

    Have you ever heard anyone say, "I can forgive [person's name],
 but I can't forget what [he, she] did to me"? What is wrong with
 this statement? Is it possible to recall the fact of a wrong without
 rancour or bitterness? Is it possible to forgive someone without
 regaining complete trust in that person? Explain.


                                                                   81

QUANTITY VERSUS QUALITY (Matt. 18:21, 22).

   As is so often the case, Jesus once again answers a question with
a parable. What question prompted the parable of the unmerciful
servant? Matt. 18:21.


   Verses 15-20 of Matthew 18 contain instruction regarding conflicts
and misunderstandings. Perhaps this instruction caused Peter to ask
his famous question. But just as famous as his question is the answer
he himself gave before Christ even had a chance to respond. (Peter
was always so sure of himself?)
   It has been suggested that the Pharisees misinterpreted Amos 1:3 to
mean that a person should forgive an offender three times. But
because Jesus taught that true righteousness exceeds that of the
Pharisees (Matt. 5:20), and because the number seven was a Hebrew
symbol of perfection, Peter thought his assessment of the issue was
more than adequate.

   How did Christ answer Peter's question? Matt. 19:22.


   Read the quote below, and underline a sentence that to you
gives the meaning of Christ's answer.
   "Forgiveness is not a matter of mathematics or legal regulations,
but an attitude. He who harbors within himself the idea that at some
future time he will not forgive, is far from extending true forgiveness
even though he may go through the form of forgiving. If the spirit of
forgiveness actuates the heart, a person will be as ready to forgive a
repentant soul the eighth time as the first time, or the 491st time as the
eighth. True forgiveness is not limited by numbers; furthermore, it is
not the act that counts, but the spirit that prompts the act."
—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 449.

   Later, Peter realized the full truth of Jesus' answer and the parable
that followed it. As his words betrayed his faith, as the Lord looked
straight into his eyes, as the rooster crowed, as the tears flowed, Peter
experienced the true nature of forgiveness (Luke 22:54-62). In Christ's
"gentle countenance he read deep pity and sorrow, but there was no
anger there."—The Desire of Ages, p. 713.

    Recall a time in your life when you experienced either God's
 forgiveness or the forgiveness of another person. How did this
 forgiveness improve your quality of life? In what ways did it
 improve your relationship with God?

ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS (Matt. 18:23-35).

   If the parable of the unmerciful servant were a play, it easily
could be divided into three acts. As you read Matthew 18:23-35, try
to determine which verses fall into each act. Give a title to each act.

  Act 1

   Act 2

   Act 3

 The king's behavior symbolizes the way God deals with us.
Whom then does the king represent?


   Just as the king pardoned his servant an enormous sum, so Christ
pardons us of our sin. If not, we would be sold into the slavery of sin.
   The servant pleaded for the king to have patience, promising that
he would pay back his debt. But his debt was enormous. Most likely it
was more than the total budget for the province in which he lived. In
other terms, it equaled 60 million working days! Obviously, the king
knew there was no way the servant could repay him. Likewise, there is
nothing we can do to pay the debt of sin we owe. But when we
sincerely repent, God frees us from that debt.

   What does the servant's behavior in Matthew 18:28-30 tell us about
the nature of his repentance? Compare his fellow servant's speech with
the speech he himself had made to the king (verses 26, 29).


   The second servant's debt was 100 denarii, which amounted to
only 100 days' wages. Contrast that to the debt owed by the first
servant, and you can better understand how selfish the first servant
was. He did not need the money to pay back his debt, for the king had
pardoned it. Obviously he cared only for himself. Such selfishness
blinded him to the vastness of his own debt, prevented him from
appreciating the king's exceptional mercy, and caused him to deal
harshly with a fellow human.

    How real to you is your indebtedness to God? Think of
 someone you are having difficulty forgiving. How would it help
 to compare this person's actions to what God has forgiven you?
 Even though you feel that this person's debt to you is great, how
 can you acquire a forgiving spirit?

                                                                     83
Wednesday                                           September 3
HOW TO LOSE IT ALL (Matt. 18:32-34).

   We have discussed the king and the servant who owed him a
sum too enormous to repay. Today we will take another look at
the king. Describe his reaction when he heard about the first
servant's behavior toward another servant. Matt. 18:32-34.


   The king's response is shocking, especially when we consider how
compassionate he had been earlier toward the same person! Yet such a
stunning reaction tells us precisely how serious an offense it is not to
forgive a fellow human. (See verse 35.)
   The king's question in verse 33 sums up the meaning of the
parable. "In so far as his finite limitations permit, the Christian will
emulate the perfect and complete manner of God's forgiveness
whenever someone offends him. . . . The fact that the Christian has
been the recipient of a full measure of divine forgiveness places him
under the most strict obligation to forgive his fellow men when occa-
sion arises to do so—the same extent that he has been forgiven."
—SDA Bible Dictionary, p. 370.


 What do Christians lose if they refuse to forgive others?
Matt. 6:12-15.


   Jesus ends this parable with the following admonition, "So my
heavenly Father will also do to every one of you, if you do not forgive
your brother or sister from your heart" (Matt. 18:35, NRSV; italics
supplied). Thus He returns us to Peter's question, How often should I
forgive someone who has offended me? It is not a matter of how often,
but simply of how. If we say we have forgiven someone but continue
to hold a grudge, have we forgiven that person from the heart? If we
say we have forgiven someone because circumstances dictate that we
do so or because we are motivated by an ulterior motive, have we
forgiven that person from the heart? "It is the attitude of the heart that
imparts to the words ['I forgive you'] a fullness of meaning they
would otherwise lack. The pretense of forgiveness . . . may deceive
the one to whom it is accorded, but not Him who looks on the heart
(1 Sam. 16:7)."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 450.

    Jane spread an untruth about Linda. Years later, Linda still
 finds it difficult to forgive Jane. What should Linda do? How
 will an unforgiving attitude affect Linda's spiritual freedom and
 fellowship with God?

A PRIME EXAMPLE (Luke 23:34).

   The parable of the unmerciful servant teaches us that because God
has forgiven us our great debt of sin, we are to forgive others the
offenses, large and small, they have committed against us. It also
teaches us that forgiveness is attitude, not arithmetic. With this in
mind, let us now contemplate the greatest story of forgiveness ever
told.

   As you read Luke 22:47-23:34, consider what it cost Jesus to be
so forgiving and where we would be today if He had not been so.
Thinking about these things will help us understand why
forgiveness is so essential to Christianity.


   Jesus spoke a host of amazing words, but none as amazing as "Father,
forgive them; for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34). How
wonderful Christian forgiveness is! When we are tempted to hold a
grudge or give in to bitterness, let us hear again Jesus asking forgiveness
for those who dared to crucify Him. Then let Paul's advice be our course
of action: "Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each
other, just as in Christ God forgave you" (Eph. 4:32, NIV).

  Why do you think Jesus was able to extend such forgiveness?
Luke 6:12; 22:39-46 will give you clue. Use your Bible's concord-
ance and cross references to find similar verses.


   Just as Jesus' spirit of forgiveness upon the cross is an example to
us, so is the relationship He maintained with His Father. Such a
relationship took time and effort. Yet the price of neglect was far
higher.
   In Galatians 5:22, 23, Paul describes the fruit of the Spirit—Jesus'
character. Even though these verses omit the word forgiveness, we
cannot imagine that someone described in such a way could be
otherwise than forgiving. The apostle continues by stating in verse 24
that "those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the sinful
nature" (NIV) described in verses 19-21. Surely an unforgiving spirit
can cause hatred, disagreement, jealousy, fits of rage, conflict,
division, and envy. In a sense, it can even cause idolatry, for when we
hold such a spirit, we are basically worshiping our selfish inclinations.
Let us therefore stand at the cross with those whom we need to forgive
and look, not at each other, but at our Saviour, bleeding and dying, so
He could pardon us all.


                                                                       85
Friday                                              September 5
FURTHER STUDY: Read Acts 6:8-8:1. Especially notice Acts 7:60.
What effect must Stephen's act of forgiveness have had upon Saul?
See The Acts of the Apostles, p. 101.

  Read one or both of the following: Christ's Object Lessons,
"The Measure of Forgiveness," pp. 243-251; The Desire of Ages,
"Calvary," pp. 741-757.

    "Our Saviour taught His disciples to pray: 'Forgive us our debts, as
we forgive our debtors.' A great blessing is here asked upon condi-
tions. We ourselves state these conditions. We ask that the mercy of
God toward us may be measured by the mercy which we extend to to
others. Christ declares that this is the rule by which the Lord will deal
with us: 'If ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will
also forgive you: but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither
will your Father forgive your trespasses.' Wonderful terms! but how
little are they understood or heeded. One of the most common sins,
and one that is attended with most pernicious results, is the indulgence
of an unforgiving spirit. . . . We are dependent upon the pardoning
mercy of God every day and every hour; how then can we cherish
bitterness and malice toward our fellow sinners! If, in all their daily
intercourse, Christians would carry out the principles of this prayer,what
a blessed change would be wrought in the church and in the world!
This would be the most convincing testimony that could be given to
the reality of Bible religion."—Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 170, 171.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What obligation does the person being forgiven have? What
     should be our attitude if the person being forgiven does not
     sense the need of forgiveness and, therefore, does not accept
     it?

   2. How does forgiveness affect community, or fellowship, within
      the church?

   4. What does Matthew 18:31 suggest about how we should
      react toward injustice?

   5. If a conference treasurer embezzled church funds, would
      we recommend that he be forgiven and then reinstated in
      his former position?

SUMMARY: Without forgiveness, we are estranged from God and our
fellow humans. With it, we become children of God, brothers and sisters
to each other, and radiant examples to the world of Christ's love.

                          Adriano's Witness, Part 1
                                  Quirino Alencar

              Young Adriano loved music. An Adventist musical group
          performing in his city caught his attention. He met the members
          of the group and began asking questions about their music and
          their church. Their beliefs thrilled him, and he began studying
          the Bible with them. At age 16 he joined the Adventist Church.
          He also joined the musical group that had shared the gospel with
          him.
              Adriano's parents were not happy that he had left the family's
          church. They pressured him to return to their faith. His father, a
          butcher, often brought home pork, which his mother cooked with
          many foods, making it difficult for Adriano to avoid eating
          unclean meat. Often the boy went without food rather than com-
          promise his beliefs.
              The family kept up the pressure on Adriano, but he refused to
          give in. He remained faithful and often invited his family to
          come to the church to hear his musical group perform. But they
          refused to attend. They did not want to hear anything about the
          Adventists.
              Adriano was a natural leader and was popular among the
          church's youth. He became a youth pastor and a deacon. But
          music was his first love. He often sang solos with the youth
          choir, both at the church and in rallies held in nearby towns.
              On the way home from a neighboring town where the church's
          young people had held a rally, the vehicle in which the youth
          were riding was involved in an accident. Two young people were
          killed instantly. Adriano died on the way to the hospital.
              When the pastor learned of the tragic accident, he and several
          young people from the church went to visit Adriano's family.
          They found the family's home filled with people who had come
           to mourn the loss of this young man. The family's own pastor
           had not come to the home, and when Adriano's father saw the
           Adventist pastor, he said, "My son loved music. Please sing to
           comfort us." The group sang, and members of the Adventist
           Church stayed with the family throughout the day and night. The
           next day Adriano would be buried. Would his death be the end of
           the family's contact with the Adventist Church?
                                                      (Continued next week)

            Quirino Alencar is now a pastor in Maranhao State in Brazil.
          Adriano's family lives in the city of Imperatriz, Brazil.

          We're on Our Way




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Luke 12:35-40; Matt. 25:35-40.

  MEMORY TEXT: "Therefore you also be ready, for the
  Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect" (Luke
  12:40, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: This week's lesson answers the question, How
should Christians await their Lord's return?

    AN AIRLINE STEWARD HELPED THE NERVOUS YOUNG
MAN find his seat next to a young woman who was a frequent flyer.
Noticing that her seatmate even listened to the monologue concerning
passenger safety, she smiled and asked, "Is this your first flight?"
    The young man nodded and grinned in return. Then he pulled out
of his carry-on bag a picture of an attractive woman who appeared to
be about his age. "I'm going to visit my fiance' and meet her parents."
Just then another steward announced that the captain had turned on
the fasten-seatbelt sign. The apprehensive passenger released the photo
only long enough to click his seatbelt into place and tuck his duffle
bag under the seat in front of him. He was interested in and concerned
about everything relating to the Boeing 747 that would carry him to
the arms of his beloved.
    As Christians, we are on our way to see our Beloved—Jesus Christ.
Are we as interested in how we make the trip as the young man in the
illustration? Yes, we are going to see our Saviour. What should we be
doing as we await our arrival?

TO BE OR NOT TO BE—FAITHFUL (Luke 12:35-40).

    Even though Jesus is speaking to His disciples (Luke 12:22), there
is a crowd of thousands gathered around Him (Luke 12:1). Thus, with
this parable, Jesus teaches publicly for the first time about His second
coming.

  In Luke 12:40, Jesus states the meaning of the parable. What
does the parable tell us about what it means to be ready? Verse 35.


   "Let your loins be girded about" (Luke 12:35) refers to how a
man would gather the loose folds of his outer garment and tuck them
into his belt so he could work unhindered.
   "And your lights burning" (Luke 12:35). A typical artificial
source of light in Bible times consisted of a wick floating in a "sauce
boat" of oil. The wick constantly needed to be trimmed and the oil
refilled or the light would fail.
   The servants in the parable are waiting for their master to return
from a wedding banquet. Such a "banquet might consist only of a
single meal; but if the host were a person of wealth, the feasting could
continue for days. When the master of the servants attended a wed-
ding banquet, he would be absent from the household for an indeter-
minate length of time. Because of the uncertainty a servant might
neglect normal responsibilities and become lazy. Such a servant would
be faithless. On the other hand a servant might diligently attend to the
usual duties regardless of the master's absence and the uncertainty of
the time of the master's return."—Pentecost, The Parables of Jesus,
p. 83.
   One of those duties included waiting by the gate for the master so
one could open it immediately upon his return (verse 36). Because
people then did not usually travel at night, it would be logical for a
servant to assume that once the sun had set, his master would not be
coming. The next logical thought easily could be to neglect to wait by
the gate until it was daylight.

  What did Jesus say about performing a duty, regardless of the
apparent need for that duty to be done? Luke 12:38.


  The second watch was three hours before midnight, while the third
watch occurred three hours after midnight.

   What "outer garment" prevents you from faithfully serving
 Christ while you await His return?

                                                                     89
Monday                                              September 8
SERVICE WITH A TWIST (Luke 12:37).

  What interesting, unexpected turn of events occurs in the
parable? Luke 12:37.


   Certainly this master is the one to work for! His fringe benefits are
highly unusual. And not only that, he himself sets the example of
service for his employees.

  List at least three specific occasions and their texts when the
Son of Man served people while He lived on earth.


   "In His life and lessons, Christ has given a perfect exemplification
of the unselfish ministry which has its origin in God. God does not
live for Himself. By creating the world, and by upholding all things,
He is constantly ministering for others. . . . This ideal of ministry God
has committed to His Son. Jesus was given to stand at the head of
humanity, that by His example He might teach what it means to
minister. His whole life was under a law of service. He served all,
ministered to all. Thus He lived the law of God, and by His example
showed how we are to obey it."—The Desire of Ages, p. 649.

   In what ways does Christ serve us now?

   Heb. 4:14

   Heb. 5:9

   Ps. 5:12

   Ps. 29:11

   In the future, Christ will serve us at the grandest wedding banquet
of all—the wedding supper of the Lamb (Rev. 19:9). Thus this little
parable teaches us that in order to be served by Christ, we must be
willing and faithful to serve others.

    As Jesus showed when He washed the disciples' feet at their
 last Passover together, service for another need not be on a
 grand scale. What little service that could bring great comfort
 can you do for someone today?

FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS (Luke 12:39).

   The parable we have been studying teaches us that while we are
waiting for Christ to return, we are to engage in faithful service on
His behalf. How did Christ further develop this concept within
this passage? Luke 12:39.


   The person who owned the house not only provided for the
material needs of the people under his care. He was responsible for
protecting them, as well. Thus, it was his obligation to make sure the
gate was guarded at all times. Furthermore, if the owner were to be
warned of an approaching burglar, he would defend the gate with
extra guards.

   We have a duty to protect what Christ has delegated to our
care. What might some of the things be that He has asked us to
safeguard? Think of ways we can safeguard them.

   Gen. 1:28; Ps. 115:16

   Ps. 127: 3

   1 Thess. 2:4

   Rev. 12:17; 19:10

   God "has given to every man his work; and every true worker
sheds forth light to the world, because he is united with God and
Christ and heavenly angels in the grand work of saving the lost. From
divine association he becomes more and more intelligent in working
the works of God. In working out what divine grace works in, the
believer becomes spiritually great. He who works according to his
entrusted ability will become a wise builder for the Master; for he is
under the apprenticeship to Christ, learning to work the works of God.
He will not shun burdens of responsibility, for he will realize that each
one must lift in the cause of God to the extent of his ability, and he
places himself under the pressure of the work; but Jesus does not
leave His willing and obedient servant to be crushed. It is not the man
who carries heavy responsibilities in the cause of God who needs your
pity, for he is faithful and true in cooperation with God; and through
union of divine and human effort, the work is made complete. It is he
who shuns responsibilities, who has no realization of the privilege to
which he is called, who is an object of pity."—Selected Messages,
book 1, p. 376.

HOW CAN I HELP YOU? (Matt. 25:35-40).

   The first parable we studied this week taught us that we must be
ready for Christ to return even when we do not expect Him, and that to
be ready means to be active in His work. Today and tomorrow we will
study a parable that describes in more detail what our service should
consist of while we await His return.
   Once again, Jesus uses items familiar to the people to get His point
across. In Palestine, sheep and goats were often tended together in one
flock. Thus, Matthew 25:32 depicted a familiar sight.

 On what basis does the Son of Man separate the people?
Matt. 25:34-36, 41-43.


  What principles about helping others can we learn from this
parable? Matt. 25:35-40.


   1. Matt. 25:35, 36. Associated with the all-important sharing of
the gospel is the effort to satisfy people's basic needs for food and
water, clothing, shelter, healthcare, and companionship. We need
people who can fund the building of a new hospital or university
science laboratory. Not everyone has such resources. But we can all
give simple help to the people whose lives we touch.
   2. Matt. 25:37-39. The type of help God accepts is that which is
a natural reaction of a loving heart. In the parable, those who
helped did so, not because they wanted to earn favor with God, but
because they were constrained by love to serve others. The people on
the right and the left both asked the same question, "Lord, when did
we see you?" (verses 37, 44, NIV). But what the people on the left
actually meant was "Lord, if we had known it was really You instead
of just some homeless beggar, we would have helped!"
   3. Matt. 25:40. Whatever we do for another person, we do for
Christ. How is this so? If you really want to make parents happy, do
something for their child. God is our parent, and the way to gladden
His heart is to help His children—our fellow humans.
   "In making the needs of others our responsibility we reflect this
same aspect of the divine character. When we reflect the character of
Jesus perfectly we will feel as He does toward those in need, and
through us He will be able to solace and succor others. The best
evidence of love for God is love that leads us to bear 'one another's
burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ' (Gal. 6:2 . . .)."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 5, p. 512.

THAT PERSONAL TOUCH (Matt. 25:35).

   As you review Matthew 25:31-46, notice that the help given is
administered on a one-to-one basis instead of through group
effort. Why did Christ emphasize the personal touch in helping
others?


  Describe some dangers and benefits in utilizing committees and
organizations to help others.


   The importance of serving others while we await the return of
Christ is underscored by the reward we obtain if we do so or the
punishment we receive if we do not. (See Matt. 25:34, 41, 46.) This
reward or punishment is a natural result. It should never become the
motivation that calls us to service. You will remember from yesterday's
lesson one of the principles regarding service this parable teaches—
the type of help that wins God's approval is that help which is a
natural reaction of a loving heart.
   When Christ came to this earth the first time, He concealed His
glory in order to live among us. The kingdom He established then was
His kingdom of grace. But when He comes the second time, He will
come in His glory (Matt. 25:31) to set up His eternal kingdom
(Rev. 11:15), referred to in Matthew 25:34 as the inheritance.
   "Everlasting fire" (Matt. 25:41, KJV) refers to the fires that
destroy the wicked in the last days. The Greek word means "lasting
for an age" and was often used to describe the Roman emperors—they
held office for life. The length of time signified by this Greek word
was determined by the character of the object it described. In the case
of Tiberius Caesar, the word describes a 23-year period—the time his
reign began until the time of his death.
    Following the principle that the length of time signified by the
Greek word was determined by the nature of the object it described,
"we find that the reward of the righteous is life to which there is no
end; the reward of the wicked is death to which there is no end
(John 3:16; Rom. 6:23; etc.). In John 3:16 'everlasting life' is
contrasted with 'perish.' In 2 Thess. 1:9 the wicked are said to be
 `punished with everlasting destruction.' The expression does not
signify a process that goes on forever, but an act whose results are
 permanent."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 513. (See also Jude 7.)

   Review this week's lesson by summarizing what it means to
 be ready for Christ's return. Include as part of your summary
 how you can put this meaning to use in your life.

FURTHER STUDY: Meditate upon Isaiah 58.

  Read "Doing for Christ," Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 24-37.

   "I have been instructed to refer our people to the fifty-eighth
chapter of Isaiah. Read this chapter carefully and understand the kind
of ministry that will bring life into the churches. The work of the
gospel is to be carried by means of our liberality as well as by our
labors. When you meet suffering souls who need help, give it to them.
When you find those who are hungry, feed them. In doing this you
will be working in lines of Christ's ministry. The Master's holy work
was a benevolent work. Let our people everywhere be encouraged to
have a part in it."—Welfare Ministry, p. 29.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Part of Isaiah 58 deals with the Sabbath (verses 13, 14).
     How can the Sabbath help us to "be dressed ready for
     service"? (Luke 12:35, NIV).

  2. Time goes faster when we are occupied with meaningful
     work. Relate our being occupied in work for the Lord to the
     discussion that often surfaces regarding the seeming delay
     of Christ's return.

  3. How can meeting people's basic needs help them to help
     themselves? What other types of assistance can help people
     to improve their situations?

SUMMARY: We are on our way to see our Saviour. Indeed, to live
with Him. While we await this reunion, let us encourage others to
share such good fortune through our disinterested service in their
behalf.

                       Adriano's Witness, Part 2
                               Quirino Alencar

           Adriano was a teenager whose love for music drew him to the
       Adventist Church. His family, members of another church, ob-
       jected to his decision to become an Adventist. They made it
       difficult for Adriano to remain true to his new beliefs. But
       Adriano had found something that he could not deny, and he
       held fast to his faith. He sang in a choir that traveled to other
       towns to witness for the church. But an accident on the way
       home from one musical rally took the lives of three Adventist
       youths. Adriano was one of them.
           The day after he died, Adriano was buried. Nearly every
       member of the local Adventist church attended the funeral, held
       in driving rain. But members of the family's church had not
       come, because Adriano had chosen to leave their church and join
       the Adventists. Even the family's pastor had stayed away. The
       family was shocked and saddened but asked the Adventist pastor
       to speak.
           The pastor told of Adriano's influence on the church mem-
       bers and encouraged the family to honor Adriano's faith. He
       assured the family that they would meet Adriatic, again in heaven.
       Then Adriano's singing group sang his favorite hymn, which
       contained the words of Revelation 22:7, "Behold I come quickly."
           Later Adriano's father said, "In this time of our need, I have
       seen that my church does not have the love of Jesus, but the
        Seventh-day Adventist Church has this love. I want to visit the
       church that offers love." Adriano's father began to study the
        Adventist message. He testifies, "I miss my son, but through his
        death many lives will be saved for eternity."
           Adriano's parents, his brothers, and his grandmother have
        been baptized into the Adventist Church. His father has wit-
        nessed to several members of his former church, and they have
        become Adventists, as well. Even his butcher shop is a testi-
        mony to his changed life. He no longer sells unclean meats. In
        fact, before his baptism, he sold all his pigs and destroyed the
        pig sty. He wanted nothing more to do with these animals.
           Adriano does not know that his death has brought his family
        to the Adventist Church. But when Christ comes, Adriano will
        sing with joy as he sees his family receive the blessing of Jesus
        in heaven.

         Quirino Alencar now pastors in Maranhao State in Brazil.
       Adriano's family lives in the city of Imperatriz, Brazil.

Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 25:1-13.

   MEMORY TEXT: "Abide in Him, that when He appears, we
   may have confidence and not be ashamed before Him at His
   coming" (1 John 2:28, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Waiting for the Lord's return does not mean that
we sit idle. We prepare ourselves for the glorious event by ever strength-
ening our relationship with Him and serving others on His behalf.

    PREPARING FOR A SPECIAL EVENT CAN BE AS EXCITING
AS THE EVENT ITSELF. And certainly thoughtful preparations help
us to be confident that the event will be a rewarding one.
    Around the world, people prepare to celebrate the first coming of
Christ in many different ways. In Mexico, families trim their houses
with greenery and nativity scenes. These decorations set the stage for
the many posadas in which they will take part—processions of family
and friends that go from house to house by prearranged invitation.
These processions symbolize Mary and Joseph's journey to Bethlehem.
    Lights play an important role in Canada, where in Esquimalt, Brit-
ish Columbia, the Canadian navy prepares for the holiday by stringing
their ships with colored lights. Meanwhile, Ukrainian families in
Canada often plan to place a candle on the table during Christmas Eve
to symbolize the star of Bethlehem. Three special loaves of bread
must be baked to place around the candle. These represent God the
Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost.
    What effort do we need to put into preparing for Christ's second
coming? This week's lesson will answer this all-important question.

VIVID PICTURES (Matt. 25:1-13).

   Jesus' setting for the parable of the ten maidens portrays a vivid
picture of an ancient Near Eastern wedding. Usually held in the
evening, the bridal party would await the bridegroom at the bride's
home. Upon arrival, the groom would accompany the bride and
attendants to his own house, where the guests would partake of a
feast. While the maidens linger, their lamps burn as brightly as their
expectations. We can imagine them gathered around the door, holding
their lamps out into the night as they search for signs of the bridegroom's
arrival. But as his delay lengthens, they grow weary with waiting.

   Match the following elements of the parable to the items below.
(a) the experience being related by the parable; (b) the five wise
maidens; (c) the five foolish maidens; (d) the bridegroom; (e) the
lamps; (f) the oil; (g) a time of waiting; (h) the arrival of the
bridegroom; (i) midnight; (j) light from the oil.

         1.        the Holy Spirit
         2.        the word of God
         3.        those who know the truth and have yielded to the
                   Holy Spirit
         4.        the darkest hour of earth's history
         5.        Christ's second coming
         6.        good deeds; works of service
         7.        the experience of the church just before the second
                   coming
         8.        when our faith is tested
         9.        those who know the truth, but have not yielded to
                   the Holy Spirit
          10.      Christ

   We will discuss each of these elements throughout the week. You
can check your answers with the material found in each day's lesson.
   Jesus knew that the end of His earthly ministry was near, that soon
the disciples would be in turmoil as they gazed upon Him dying a
criminal's death. With this story, He was telling them that there was
hope beyond their Calvary tears. Hope in the coming of their Lord.
   When and how has the Lord shown you hope beyond the tears
 that blinded your eyes? How did these experiences help you to
 have faith in all of Christ's promises?
                                                                        97

BEG, BORROW, OR STEAL (Ps. 119:105; Zech. 4:1-6; Matt. 25:11,12).

  What meaning did Christ give to His parable of the ten
maidens? Matt. 25:13.


  As we study each element of the parable, we will learn more about
what it means to keep watch.

   Just as the bridesmaids waited for the groom, so the church
waits for Christ to return. What is our "lamp" and "oil"?
Ps. 119:105; Zech. 4:1-6.


   Zerubbabel and his companions were depressed. They had little
resources with which to rebuild the temple. And opposition from their
enemies stalled what little they could do. But God showed them that
His objectives are achieved not so much through human effort as
through the power of His Holy Spirit.
   So it is with the church today. Its members know the truth as it is in
Scripture. They believe in Christ's return and eagerly look forward to
seeing Him. But while they wait, their faith is tested. The resources
they have to work with appear small, opposition to their efforts
overwhelming. Those who have yielded to the influence of the Holy
Spirit will encounter success and will be ready to meet Christ. But
those who have not yielded, fall prey to discouragement and will,
therefore, be caught off guard when Christ returns.
   Such people are acquainted with God's commands and promises.
But they have not allowed these to transform their lives. Like the
stony-ground hearers in the parable of the sower, they gladly accept
the truth, but they do not permit it to become the motivating force in
their lives.
   Listen to the cries of the five foolish maidens at the door of the
groom's house, for they teach us well. First, there are certain items we
cannot obtain at the last minute. A relationship with Christ is one such
thing. We cannot expect to be ready for Him if we have not prepared
for Him. And second, there are certain things we cannot borrow. Just
as the foolish maidens could not borrow oil from their companions, so
we cannot borrow a relationship with God. We must have our own.

    How would you rate your relationship with God? Do you
 depend too much on those around you for your spiritual well-
 being? Always remember, someone else's account is not a bank
 from which you can withdraw blessings.

MAKING A DIFFERENCE (Matt. 25:7; Joel 2:28, 29).

    All ten virgins were surprised by the bridegroom's arrival. But
only five were prepared to make the trip to his house. What was it
that made the difference? Matt. 25:7, 8. What about the Christian
life does this symbolize?


   "The wise virgins of the parable represent those Christians who
understand, appreciate, and avail themselves of the ministry of the
Holy Spirit. 'Wise' indeed are Christians today who welcome the
Holy Spirit into their lives and cooperate with Him in His appointed
task."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 508.

  Describe the various tasks of the Holy Spirit. John 3:5, 6;
16:7-15; Gal. 5:16-26; 1 Cor. 12:4-11; Joel 2:28, 29.


   The Holy Spirit gives spiritual fruit to all believers and special gifts
based on our individual abilities and the needs that exist in each of our
personal experiences. The motivating factor in the distribution of
these gifts is to prepare us to meet Christ at His second coming. (See
SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 772.)
   Ephesians 4:12 further states that we receive these gifts for yet
another reason: "to prepare God's people for works of service, so that
the body of Christ may be built up" (NIV). In Ephesians, chapter 5,
Paul urges us to live as children of light. "For you were once darkness,
but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light (for the
fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and truth)"
(Eph. 5:8, 9, NIV). When our lights shine as a result of the Holy Spirit
transforming our lives and living in us, the good deeds and works of
service He enables us to perform will illuminate all the little corners
of the world in which we live.
   Joel 2:28, 29 speaks of more than just the reception of the Spirit
that accompanies conversion and changes the life. This prophecy met
partial fulfillment at Pentecost (Acts 2:16-21). It will reach its fullness
"in the manifestation of divine grace which will attend the closing
work of the gospel."—The Great Controversy, p. ix.

   How is it a source of encouragement to you that the Holy
 Spirit distributes His gifts according to our individual abilities
 and needs? Why should you not feel slighted if someone has a
 greater number of gifts, or more visible gifts, than you have?



                                                                       99

NEVER GIVE UP THE SHIP! (Matt. 25:5; Gen. 7:7-10).

   In the parable of the ten virgins, there is a period of waiting symboliz-
ing the wait for Christ's return that we are now experiencing. During this
time, our faith is often tried, and we are inclined to grow weary.

   As you read the following texts, note who was involved, what
they were waiting for, what they did while waiting, and the final
outcome.


                      Gen. 7:7-10      Exod. 32:1-4,       Acts 1:4, 5;
                                       25-35               2:1-4, 14, 41


Who waited and
what were they
waiting for?




What did they
do while wait-
ing?




What was the
final outcome?




  What do these examples teach us about the importance of what
we do while we wait for Christ to return?


   It has been nearly 2,000 years since Christ promised to
return. Why do you think His coming has been delayed so
long? What negative effects has this had on you? What can
you do to overcome these effects and take Christ's promise
more seriously?

WHAT TIME IS IT? (Matt. 24:30, 31; 25:6).

   In the parable we are studying this week, when did the
bridegroom finally arrive? Matt. 25:6.


   The time when the bridegroom arrives symbolizes the point in
earth's history when Christ will return. What will the world be
like just before the second coming?

  Matt. 24:5

  Matt. 24:6

  Matt. 24:12

  Matt. 24:37, 38

   Luke 21:11


   Despite the ark's testament to the coming flood, people continued
with their daily rounds of labor and desire, totally disregarding the
event soon to come upon them. Such will be the attitude of many
people just before Christ returns.
    But God calls upon His people to broadcast "a message illuminat-
ing in its influence and saving in its power. His character is to be made
known. Into the darkness of the world is to be shed the light of His
glory, the light of His goodness, mercy, and truth. . . .
   "Those who wait for the Bridegroom's coming are to say to the
people, 'Behold your God.' The last rays of merciful light, the last
message of mercy to be given to the world, is a revelation of His
character of love. The children of God are to manifest His glory. In
their own life and character they are to reveal what the grace of God
has done for them."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 415, 416. (See
Isa. 60:2; 40:9, 10.)

     We have listened to the appeals of the foolish maidens and
 considered what their cries teach us. Look now upon the Light
 shining from the lamps of the five wise maidens. Are you on the
 pathway made visible by that Light? Outline for yourself all that
 is involved in being one of the believers represented by the wise
 maidens.

                                                                    101

FURTHER STUDY: Review this week's memory text, 1 John 2:28.
Then read John 15:1-17. What does it mean to abide in Christ? How do
these verses help us understand what it means to prepare for His return?

  Also read any or all of the following: Christ's Object Lessons,
"To Meet the Bridegroom," pp. 405-421; The Great Controversy,
"Prophecies Fulfilled," pp. 393, 394; "In the Holy of Holies,"
pp. 426, 427; The Story of Redemption, "The Second Angel's
Message," "The Midnight Cry," pp. 367-374.

   "All who wait for the heavenly Bridegroom are represented in the
parable as slumbering because their Lord delayed His coming; but the
wise roused themselves at the message of His approach, and
responded to the message, and their spiritual discernment was not all
gone, and they sprang into line. As they took hold of the grace of
Christ, their religious experience became vigorous and abundant, and
their affections were set upon things above. They discerned where
was the source of their supply, and appreciated the love that God had
for them. They opened their hearts to receive the Holy Spirit, by
which the love of God was shed abroad in their hearts. Their lights
were trimmed and burning, and sent forth steady rays into the moral
darkness of the world. They glorified God, because they had the oil of
grace in their hearts, and did the very work that their Master did
before them—went forth to seek and to save those who were lost. . . .
   "The very best credentials we can carry is love for one another. All
strife, all dissension, is to cease. God will not accept the talents of the
smartest, the most eloquent man if the inner lamp of the soul is not
trimmed and burning. There must be a consecrated heart, and
consecrated surrender of the soul."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 5, pp. 1099, 1100.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. According to the parable we have studied this week, what is
     wisdom?

   2. In a paragraph of four or five sentences, write what it
      means to keep watch for the Lord's return.

   3. What customs or events in your part of the world could you
      use to illustrate the meaning of the parable of the ten
      maidens?

SUMMARY: The story in Matthew 25:1-13 is every bit a call to
service as is the gospel commission of Matthew 28:19, 20. Let us trim
our lamps, replenish our oil, and be on our way.

Mahal Magian
                  More Powerful Than Magic, Part 1
                     Peter Tambala and Beverly H. Koester

           Peter Tambala spent his school vacation canvassing near his home
       village in a remote area of Malawi. The 18-year-old student often
       walked six to twelve miles a day, carrying Bibles and literature to
       sell. Church leaders welcomed the youth as a fellow worker and often
       invited him to eat at the ministers' table. Sometimes they asked him
       to present a sermon or help with other church work besides his
       canvassing.
           But Peter's acceptance by the ministers presented a problem for
       the older members. Traditionally, youth were not to take part in the
       divine service. This privilege was reserved for senior elected church
       officers only. In some areas, to go against tradition sometimes brought
       retaliation by use of magic.
           Since Peter had become a Christian, he had decided that magic
       was simply a superstition in people's mind. But when a student at his
       school suddenly died, his friends said some others had put a curse on
       the boy because they were jealous that he was doing better than they.
       "Magic is real," Peter said. "And it is scary."
           One day Peter visited an older man in his village. The man warned
       Peter that he no longer seemed to be a "village boy," that he acted as
       if he had bettered himself, and that he could quickly become the
       victim of a spell cast on him if he appeared better than the other
       villagers. Peter listened to the man out of respect but did not believe
       that someone from his own village would hurt him. But later Peter
       began to think, What if magic is real. The thought frightened him.
           Peter talked to a trusted friend about how a Christian deals with
        magic. "I know that the devil is real," he said, "and he does whatever
        he can to keep people on his side." But his friend reminded him that
        Christians serve a God who is more powerful than the devil and his
        magic. If we trust God for our strength, then the devil's magic cannot
        touch us. But if we fear magic, we are saying magic is more powerful
        than God.
            Peter affirmed his belief in God's power and thanked his friend for
        helping him remember that God is bigger than the devil. Soon
        afterward, Peter returned to his canvassing work near his hometown.
        Neither he nor his friend knew that their conversation that day was a
        preparation for a test Peter would soon face.
                                                       (Continued next week)

          Beverly H. Koester is sponsorship coordinator in the Malawi
        Union in Eastern Africa. Peter is a student in Blantyre, Malawi.

           The Last Invitation




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 22:1-14.

   MEMORY TEXT: "He has clothed me with the garments of
   salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness"
   (Isaiah 61:10, RSV).

   KEY THOUGHT: The Christian journey has two beginnings. The
first occurs on this earth when we accept Christ's call to follow Him.
This beginning carries us down the path to the second one, which
takes place in heaven at the marriage supper of the Lamb. This event
will inaugurate our freedom from the pain and tears of sin.

   BOUQUETS AND GARLANDS AS BRILLIANT AS A SUNRISE.
Guests bedecked in their finest, laughing, smiling, delighted to be
included; a storybook bride and groom; tables laden with food that
entices the taste buds. Or indifferent people, totally preoccupied with
personal affairs; proceedings put on hold; bloodshed and ruin; and
finally the banishment of a tacky guest.
   Which of the above wedding festivities would you rather attend?
The choice seems obvious. Yet the latter version is the one Christ
chose to portray in Matthew 22.
   But despite this parable's twists and turns, suspense and dramatic
action, there is a happy outcome implied by the text. As you study this
parable, you will learn why Christ made the choice He did, what the
happy outcome involves, and how you can attend the most joyous
wedding banquet of all.

THE MASTER TEACHER (Matt. 22:1-14; Luke 14:15-23).

    Upon first reading the parable of the marriage feast (Matt. 22:
1-13), you might think it is the same as the parable of the great supper
(Luke 14:16-24) which we studied in Lesson 3. Many scholars focus
on the similarities of these two passages and assume that one was
originally a repetition of the other. "Their conclusion denies Christ the
privilege of relating the same story on different occasions and varying
its details to suit the needs of the truth He designed to teach on each
occasion."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 478.

   Read the following texts to determine what major differences
exist between the two parables.


                              The wedding feast      The great supper

Who gave each banquet?
Matt. 22:1, 2; Luke 14:16.



Why was each banquet
given? Matt. 22:2; Luke
14:16, 17.


How did the invitees treat
the messengers? Matt. 22:5,
6; Luke 14:18.



   Furthermore, (a) Matthew 22 emphasizes the preparation needed to
attend, while Luke 14 focuses on the excuses given by the guests; and
(b) in Matthew 22, those who declined the invitation were banned
from the feast, while in Luke 14, those who declined where destroyed!

   What do these differences tell us about the lesson Christ wanted
each parable to teach?

    By modifying a few details, Christ could change the meaning
 of a parable to fit the lesson He desired to teach to a particular
 audience. What techniques has He used to help you learn about
 His kingdom and with what effect?

                                                                    105

A UNIQUE HOPE (Matt. 22:1-3).

   Yesterday we studied the differences that exist between the parables
of the wedding feast and the great supper. Today and the rest of the
week we will study these differences as they relate to the wedding
feast.
   As is the case with so many of Jesus' parables, the parable of the
wedding banquet had a particular meaning for the people who heard it,
as well as a special message for those who would come after. Most
likely told in the temple courts with the chief priests and elders present
(Matt. 21:23), the parable of the wedding banquet was packed with
meaning specific to their particular situation.

   To discover a portion of the meaning this parable had for the
Jews of Jesus' time, match the following parts of the parable to the
items below: (a) the Messiah; (b) the Incarnation; (c) the
provisions of the gospel made possible by the Incarnation;
(d) God; (e) the Jews; (1) John the Baptist, Jesus' disciples (the 12
and the 70), and Jesus Himself.

       1. the king                             4. the invited guest

       2. the son                              5. the banquet

       3. the marriage                         6. the messengers

   "The union of the divine and human natures in one Person, Jesus
Christ, makes possible the wedding banquet. The Incarnation is the
cornerstone for the whole edifice of salvation. 'Without controversy
great is the mystery of godliness,' exclaims the apostle Paul. 'God was
manifest in the flesh' (1 Tim. 3:16).
   "The invited guests are the Jews, subjects of the king (Matt. 22:3).
The ancient promise of a coming Redeemer (Gen. 3:15) Israel
treasured as her unique hope. Jesus declared, 'Abraham rejoiced to see
my day: and he saw it, and was glad' (John 8:56). The awed patriarch,
replacing Isaac on the altar with the ram found in a nearby thicket,
realized as never before how the Messiah would redeem all sinners by
His substitutionary death. And he was glad! . . .
   "Jesus' emphasis is upon the banquet—the provisions of the gospel
made possible by the Incarnation."—Frank B. Holbrook, "Requested
—the Honor of Your Presence," Adventist Review, Oct. 22, 1992, p. 10.

   Think about how the promise of salvation provides unique
 hope for you personally.

Tuesday                                             September 23
SCORNFUL WAYS (Matt. 22:2-10).

   How many invitations did the king issue before anyone would
come to the wedding feast? Matt. 22:2-10. Why was it necessary
for so many invitations?


   "To call those who were invited" (verse 3, NKJV). It is still the
custom in oriental countries to send messengers to remind guests of an
invitation they have already accepted.
   The Old Testament prophets were the ones who gave the Jews this
original invitation. John the Baptist, Jesus, and His disciples gave the
first call in the parable, which was the second call to Israel given
before the crucifixion.

   Israel received the second invitation of the parable (verse 4)
after the crucifixion. In what two ways did the people generally
react to this invitation? Matt. 22:5, 6.

   1.

   2.

   "The nation that claimed to be God's peculiar people rejected the
gospel brought to them in the power of the Holy Spirit. Many did this
in the most scornful manner. Others were so exasperated by the offer
of salvation, the offer of pardon for rejecting the Lord of glory, that
they turned upon the bearers of the message. There was 'a great
persecution.' Acts 8:1. Many both of men and women were thrust into
prison, and some of the Lord's messengers, as Stephen and James,
were put to death.
   "Thus the Jewish people sealed their rejection of God's mercy. The
result was foretold by Christ in the parable. The king 'sent forth his
armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.' The
judgment pronounced came upon the Jews in the destruction of Jerusa-
lem and the scattering of the nation."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 308, 309.

    After they received the second invitation of the parable, some
 of the people rudely returned to their farms and bus-
 inesses—ordinary, daily occupations that in themselves were not
 bad, but that became an affront to royalty and stood in the way of
 the guests receiving the king's favor. What daily activities, good in
 themselves, prevent you from partaking of the banquet of
 blessings salvation has to offer? Are there aspects of the advent
 message that your way of life prevents you from accepting?

                                                                        107
Wednesday                                        September 24
THE THIRD AND FINAL CALL (Matt. 22:8-10).

   Yesterday we began discussing the various invitations that occur in
the parable of the wedding banquet. Today we will concentrate on the
final one that appears in Matthew 22:8-10.

   To whom did the king issue the last invitation?


   The obvious rejection of the King's first two invitations resulted in
Israel's destruction and the loss of their status as God's chosen agency
to spread the gospel. The Lord gave the task to another—the Christian
church, spiritual Israel. (Read Matt. 21:43; 1 Peter 2:9, 10.)
   Thus the servants took the third invitation into the highways and
byways, gathering anyone who would respond. The chief priests and
elders who were listening to Jesus heard that they would lose their
privileges to sinners and Gentiles—people they considered unworthy
of their King's favor.
   "The wedding banquet is ready" (Matt. 22:8, NIV). Some people
have difficulty with the statement that the wedding feast is still ready
after the king eliminated his enemies (verse 7). But oriental feasts
often last several days. And because no one had come to receive the
king's generosity, the feast was still ready, even though the scheduled
time for it had passed.

  Of what is the third and final invitation in this parable a
symbol? Matt. 28:18-20.


   "In the original language the tense suggests that the intent of the
king's command was 'Go, again and again,' until the banquet hall is
filled (Matt. 22:9). In that brief order, Jesus covered the whole
Christian Era. The banquet hall, filled with guests, represents the
church, the fellowship of believers. Until human probation closes, the
order of the King to His servants is (in modem terms): 'Evangelize!' "
—Holbrook, "Requested—the Honor of Your Presence," p. 11.

   Think of what it means to evangelize. Is it more than holding
meetings, preaching, and giving Bible studies? If so, how much
more? What have you been doing lately to extend the King's
invitation to participate in the bounties of salvation? How do
you believe your spiritual gifts can be used in attracting others
to the Lord's banquet?



108
Thursday                                         September 25
"HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?" (Matt. 22:10-14).

   The success the king's servants had in issuing the third invita-
tion was tainted by the fact that the wedding hall was filled with
both good and bad (verse 10). How does this describe the nature of
the church?


   The varied dispositions of the 12 disciples reflect the nature of the
church. Christ suffered long with each disciple's temperament, giving
them all an equal chance to be transformed. But, as seen in the life of
Judas and in the parable we are studying this week, the good will be
separated from the bad. (See also Matt. 13:41, 42, 47-50.)
   Beginning with verse 11, the parable changes its emphasis from a
correct response to the king's invitations to the correct preparation
for the feast. This included provision that the guests be suitably
clothed with wedding attire.

   What does the wedding garment symbolize? Isa. 61:10; Rev. 19:7, 8.


   "There is a two-way process in getting ready for the king's ban-
quet. There is a disrobing of 'the old man,' or 'the old nature with its
deeds,' and the clothing of oneself with 'the new man'—the new
converted nature (cf. Eph. 4:22-24; Rom. 13:13, 14; Col. 3:5-11).
   "When the sinner comes to God, repenting and confessing his sins,
and by faith accepts Christ as his Saviour and Lord, he is graciously
forgiven and clothed in Christ—His righteousness. And in that 'robe,'
the bond of union, he continues in the transforming process of grace."
—Holbrook, "Requested—the Honor of Your Presence," p. 11.
   "Put on the garments that suit God's chosen people, his own, his
beloved: compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, patience" (Col.
3:12, NEB).
   "When the king came in to see the guests" (Matt. 22: 11, NIV).
This suggests inspection and evaluation, and thus represents the pre-
advent, investigative judgment. Judgment symbolism is present also
in: (a) how the unsuitably dressed guest is evicted, and (b) the phrases
"outer darkness" and "weeping and gnashing of teeth" (verse 13). We
find each of these phrases in other texts about the condemnation of the
wicked (Matt. 8:11, 12).

    Despite the fact that the guest was improperly attired, the
 king still called him "friend" (Matt. 22:12). What does this tell
 us about God's feelings toward the man. How does the approach
 to the man relate to John 15:14?

                                                                    109
Friday                                          September 26
FURTHER STUDY: Despite the one guest's being expelled from the
banquet hall, the parable does have a happy ending. There are still
guests inside who were wearing the king's garments. Read about them
in Revelation 19:6-9. This is the happy ending to the parable we
alluded to in Sabbath afternoon's lesson.

   Also read "Without a Wedding Garment," Christ's Object Les-
sons, pp. 307-319.

   "The spiritual banquet has been set before us in rich abundance.
We have had presented to us by the messengers of God the richest
feast—the righteousness of Christ, justification by faith, the exceed-
ing great and precious promises of God in His Word, free access to the
Father by Jesus Christ, the comforts of the Holy Spirit, and the
well-grounded assurance of eternal life in the kingdom of God. We
ask, What could God do for us that He has not done in preparing the
great supper, the heavenly banquet?"—Ellen G. White Comments,
SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1097.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Considering what the various elements of the parable of the
     marriage feast symbolize, what does the "outer darkness"
     represent? (Matt. 22:13).

   2. Explain what Christ meant by His closing statement of the
      parable, "For many are invited, but few are chosen"
      (Matt. 22:14, NIV). These texts may help you: Rev. 22:17;
      John 3:16; Matt. 5:6; 7:13, 14.

  3. The expulsion of the man without a wedding garment
     represents God's rejection of some professed believers
     before the second coming of Jesus. Hence, we know that the
     story is designed to teach that God examines His professed
     people in a pre-advent judgment. (Compare Dan. 7:9-14.)
     What does this indicate regarding God's way of preparing
     us to meet Jesus when He returns?

SUMMARY: Jesus invites us all to the marriage feast of the Lamb.
Will you accept His invitation and agree to wear His special wedding
garment?

                More Powerful Than Magic, Part 2
                   Peter Tambala and Beverly H. Koester

         Peter thought Christians should not believe in magic. But
                                                                                I
     recent events had made him wonder. The pastor where he can-
     vassed invited him to offer prayer for the church service. Peter
     agreed. But people began to tell him, "You are just a boy; you
     should not pray in the divine service. Go and sit where you
                                                                                n
     belong." Others called his willingness to pray in public a sign of
     pride and disrespect to his elders. Peter worried about these
     charges, but he offered the prayer, as the pastor had requested.
         The following day Peter rode a bicycle four miles to the
     pastor's home to pick up some materials. To reach the pastor's
     house he had to pass through a village notorious for its powerful
     magic. As he rode down a hillside past a certain spot on the road,
                                                                                i
     suddenly his eyes became so blurred that he could not see.
     Instantly he prayed that God would help him stop the bicycle
     without injury to himself or the other people walking along the
     path. He managed to stop the bicycle and climb off. Trembling,
                                                                                d
     he pushed the bicycle the rest of the way to the pastor's home,
     still able to see only dimly.
         To his dismay, the pastor was not home. Peter, his eyes still
                                                                                e
     blurry, turned and began pushing the bicycle toward home, squinting
     and struggling to see the path. Peter suspected that magic had caused
     his near-blindness. As he neared the spot where his eyesight had
     become blurry, he stopped and called out loud, "God, You are more
     powerful than magic. Send the devil away!" At that instant, his
     eyesight was restored. Then, instead of hurrying away from the place
     where Satan had attacked him, Peter stepped into the bushes and
                                                                                S
     prayed for several minutes, thanking God for the faith to trust in Him
      rather than to fear magic. Then Peter mounted the bicycle and
     continued on his journey.
         Peter did not tell others about his encounter with the powers
