                     Spiritual Gifts
                        Keys to Ministry

    The New Testament presents spiritual gifts as operational tools
for ministry in the church. The Holy Spirit assigns a gift or a mixture
of gifts to individual Christians. Passages in Romans, 1 Corinthians,
Ephesians, and 1 Peter describe or allude to twenty-seven spiritual
gifts. The Bible does not give a specific definition of a spiritual gift;
it illustrates how these gifts function.
    The set of spiritual gifts assigned an individual by the Holy Spirit
constitutes the framework for that person's lifelong primary ministry
in the church. The degree to which Christians put their spiritual gifts
to work for the Lord depends on their commitment to discipleship
and response to the Lord's call.
    Spiritual gifts may or may not match natural inherited talents,
abilities developed through education for a profession, or job skills
developed in the workplace. Sometimes the Holy Spirit assigns gifts
that match a person's personality profile and sometimes not. It all
depends on what ministry the Holy Spirit wants each to do.
     Seventh-day Adventists believe that the spiritual gifts manifested
in the early Christian church still function in today's church.
     Fundamental Belief No. 16 states: "God bestows upon all mem-
bers of His church in every age spiritual gifts which each member is
to employ in loving ministry for the common good of the church and
of humanity. Given by the agency of the Holy Spirit, who apportions
to each member as He wills, the gifts provide all abilities and minis-
tries needed by the church to fulfill its divinely ordained functions.
 According to the Scriptures, these gifts include such ministries as
 faith, healing, prophecy, proclamation, teaching, administration, rec-
onciliation, compassion, and self-sacrificing service and charity for
 the help and encouragement of people. Some members are called of
 God and endowed by the Spirit for functions recognized by the
 church in pastoral, evangelistic, apostolic, and teaching ministries
 particularly needed to equip the members for service, to build up the
 church to spiritual maturity, and to foster unity of the faith and
 knowledge of God. When members employ these spiritual gifts as
 faithful stewards of God's varied grace, the church is protected from
 the destructive influence of false doctrine, grows with a growth that
 is from God, and is built up in faith and love."—Seventh-day Advent-
 ist Yearbook, 1995, pp. 6, 7.
     These lessons consider the concept of spiritual gifts, examine
 each gift mentioned in the New Testament, and guide students in
 identifying and developing their gifts. The lessons also indicate how
 a local church can organize around the mixture of spiritual gifts
 found in its midst.

                                                                       5

          What the Bible Says
          About Spiritual Gifts




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Peter 4:10, 11; Matt.
25:14-30; 1 Cor. 12:12-27; Rom. 12:1-8.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Each one should use whatever gift he has
     received to serve others, faithfully administering God's grace
     in its various forms" (1 Peter 4:10, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Spiritual gifts are given to advance the cause of
God's kingdom. The Bible outlines what they are and how they work,
though it does not define each gift specifically.

    LAYING OUT THE GUIDELINES. A theology of spiritual gifts
is outlined in the Bible, especially in the writings of Paul. A theology
is a systematic exposition of what the Bible says on a certain topic, in
this case the gifts of the Spirit. This theology intertwines with Jesus'
great commission in Matthew 28:16-20, His plan for reaching the
world. The Holy Spirit functioned between the Fall and the Cross, but
not in His fullness. (See The Acts of the Apostles, p. 37.)
    After the experience at Pentecost, the Holy Spirit became the chief
administrator of the church. As one church historian notes: "The early
church organization was not centered in office, but in the special gifts
of the Spirit."—Lars Qualben, A History of the Christian Church
(New York: Thomas Nelson and Sons, 1942), p. 94. The New Testa-
ment does not define spiritual gifts precisely. It simply outlines how
the gifts work, who had them, and how they exercised them. We will
study what the New Testament says about spiritual gifts and how they
fit God's organizational pattern for the Christian church.

GRACE IN ACTION (1 Peter 4:10).

   What is the meaning of the phrase "Faithfully administering
God's grace in its various forms" (1 Peter 4:10, NIV; the KJV says
"the manifold grace of God")?


   The word grace is used many ways in the Bible. Usually it refers to
God's willingness and disposition to pardon sinners and supply them
with new minds and hearts as a result of Jesus' sacrifice on the cross.
But 1 Peter 4:10 speaks about God's grace "in its various forms."
What does that mean? The context of the verse explains. Verse 9
mentions the gift of hospitality, and verse 11 mentions the gifts of
teaching and serving. So, "administering God's grace in its various
forms" refers to the various spiritual gifts the Lord employs to do the
work of the church.
   This passage implies five principles regarding spiritual gifts: (1) An
awareness of the urgency of the times in which we live should cause
us to give priority to exercising our gifts (1 Peter 4:11); (2) We will be
held accountable for using our gifts (1 Peter 4:10); (3) Gifts should be
exercised with authority because of the assurance that they come from
God (1 Peter 4:11); (4) The exercise of our gifts should bring honor
and glory to God (1 Peter 4:11); (5) God should receive the credit for
our use of gifts, whether they are designed for leadership or support
(1 Peter 4:11).
   In Testimonies for the Church, volume 2, page 245, Ellen White
makes five significant points regarding the manifold grace of God: (1)
"None need mourn that they cannot glorify God by talents He never
gave them and for which they are not responsible"; (2) "God requires
no more of them than to improve upon what they have, as stewards of
His grace"; (3) "The varied trusts are proportioned to our varied
capabilities"; (4) "Heaven apportions to all their work, and it should
be their ambition to do this work well, according to their capabilities";
(5) "God requires that all, the weakest as well as the strongest, fulfill
their appointed work."

   What is the significance of the word faithfully (NIV) or the
phrase "as good stewards" (KJV) in 1 Peter 4:10? Compare 1 Cor.
4:2; Matt. 25:14-30.


   Faithfulness to the call of God is also known as discipleship. Every
spiritual gift is a resource given us by God to be used to the best of our
ability and, in His strength, beyond our normal ability. We will be held
accountable for the use we make of our spiritual gifts.

                                                                       7

EQUIPPING FOR ACTION (Eph. 4:12).

   Ephesians 4:11-13 gives us the guidelines for the application of
certain gifts. Apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers are
specifically assigned the task of preparing God's people for service.
(See Eph. 4:12, NIV.) These works of service in turn engender unity of
faith and knowledge of the Son of God, leading to spiritual maturity,
"the whole measure of the fullness of Christ" (verse 13, NIV). The
gifted people mentioned in this passage train others for service, who in
turn are enriched and led to spiritual maturity.

    Read Acts 19, the history of the development of the church in
Ephesus. Notice especially the situation of the original 12 mem-
bers. What happened when they received the Holy Spirit? Make a
list of the subsequent events.


   Ephesus was the place where Paul stayed for the longest time
during his missionary journeys. Ephesus became a major Christian
center. The dynamic origins of the church in Ephesus are worth careful
study.
   Ellen White illustrates the point in Gospel Workers, page 198. A
man was lost in a snowstorm. He was about to give up and knew he
would soon freeze to death. Suddenly he came across another person
who was in a worse condition. He rubbed the person's limbs, picked
him up, and carried him, since he was too weak to walk on his own.
They eventually came to a place of safety. Both were saved. The first
man's exertion in saving the second man had saved his own life.

   How did Paul use his spiritual gifts as an evangelist, an apostle,
and a teacher to train Timothy, who in turn was commissioned to
train others? 2 Tim. 1:11; 2:2.


   The King James Version limits Paul's teaching gift by adding the
words "of the Gentiles" (2 Tim. 1:11). These words do not appear in
the earliest available Greek manuscripts. Paul was enabled to teach
anyone. His gifts allowed him to teach people the way of the Lord and
to establish new churches based on the authority of the gospel. His
gifts were an ideal combination for his circumstances.

   Based on studies done on 250,000 churches across North America
and Australia, a church should have at least 60 specific tasks or
roles for every 100 members. How can you achieve that in your
church?

THE BODY ANALOGY (Rom. 12:1, 2).

   In two places, Romans 12 and 1 Corinthians 12, Paul uses a body
analogy to explain how spiritual gifts work. Though a human body is
incredibly complex, all its members work together. Many functions are
automatic. On the other hand, we can organize the ways we use our
hands and legs.
   The church is organized like a human body, the parts of which work
together to accomplish a task. The church's task is the advancement of
the kingdom to the glory of God.

   How does Paul state this body analogy? Rom. 12:1, 2.


   These are very important verses for the concept of spiritual gifts.
The word bodies (verse 1) involves more than its common application
to health and well-being. The concept here is of the composite person,
body, mind, and spirit, as Paul phrases it in 1 Thessalonians 5:23.
   "Living sacrifices" (Rom. 12:1, NIV) is an allusion to the Old
Testament sanctuary services. "Spiritual worship" (NIV), or "reason-
able service" (KJV), means, as the New English Bible translates it,
"worship offered by mind and heart." The "new birth" transforms the
mind. "Transformed" (verse 2) translates the Greek word metamorphoo,
from which comes the English "metamorphosis," used in the world of
nature to refer, for example, to the transformation of a caterpillar into a
butterfly. The renewed mind can now (1) understand God's will;
(2) understand that one's sense of self-worth is to be governed by
reason and reality, not by an exaggerated concept of one's abilities;
(3) understand its "measure of faith" (Rom. 12:3, NIV).

  What is the meaning of the phrase "measure of faith" (Rom.
12:3)? Compare Rom. 12:6 and 1 Peter 4:10.


   Notice Romans 12:4. It explains the phrase in verse 3. We usually
relate "faith" in a general way to "saving faith." Here, however, Paul
uses the word differently. Verse 4 relates the phrase to the spiritual
gifts given to Christians by the Holy Spirit. Your "measure of faith" is
your use of the gifts you have been given. The church body functions
smoothly because the combined spiritual gifts of the membership, held
together by the glue of love, are directed by the Word of God and the
Holy Spirit.

   How is this "body life" system working in your church? What
 can you and your class do to make it work better?

                                                                         9

SPIRITUAL GIFTS AND THE CALL TO DISCIPLESHIP (Romans
12).

   The process of renewing the mind (verse 2) does two things: (1) it
breaks the normal pattern of conformity to the "world," and (2) it
enables a person to "test and approve" God's will. God's will is
pictured as "good, pleasing and perfect" (Rom. 12:2, NIV).

   What four ways has Satan used to twist human thinking and
actions? 2 Cor. 4:4; 1 Cor. 2:14; Rom. 1:24; Rev. 14:8.


   When people are freed from these four satanic perversions, there
are three results:
   1. People's minds are unchained from the power of Satan.
   2. Their spiritual eyes are enlightened.
   3. The power of the gospel becomes effective in their lives.
   If allowed to work according to the biblical pattern, the Holy Spirit
transforms us into disciples. "Every true disciple is born into the
kingdom of God as a missionary."—The Desire of Ages, p. 195.
   Who is a disciple? A disciple is a person who has been born again,
has joined the church, has identified his or her spiritual gifts, has
accepted a role in the church compatible with those gifts, and is
committed to fulfilling that role without continual external human
motivation.

   Make a list of the words in Romans 12:1-8 that indicate the
spirit in which discipleship should be rendered.


   The chart below shows the application of a person's "measure of
faith" as outlined in Romans 12:

        Gift                             How Done
 Prophesying          Used in proportion to faith as God bestows the
                      gift.
Serving               Unselfish ministry to those in need.
Teaching              Imparting Bible truth to others.
Encouragement         Empathizing with and inspiring new hope to
                      those who are hurting.
Contributing          Giving according to human need.
Leadership            Governing diligently.

TALENTS AND GIFTS

   It is easy to confuse spiritual gifts with natural talents. All of us
possess inherited talents. Christians dedicate all their talents to the
Lord, but the Holy Spirit does not always choose to convert natural
talents into spiritual gifts. "The talents that Christ entrusts to His
church represent especially the gifts and blessings imparted by the
Holy Spirit."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 327.

   Whom did the Lord choose to be the chief architect and builder
of the Israelite sanctuary in the desert? Why? Exod. 31:1-11.
What does 1 Kings 7:13, 14 say about the man Solomon hired to do
the brass work in the temple?


   Notice that the builders of the desert tabernacle were specifically
called by the Lord and given certain skills. These construction and
artistic skills are not mentioned in the lists of spiritual gifts in the New
Testament. (Compare, however, Exodus 35:30-35. What gift men-
tioned in the New Testament lists was also given to Bezalel and
Oholiab? See Romans 12:7.)
   The skills given these men were apparently a combination of natu-
ral talents, enhanced by the blessing of the Lord, and spiritual gifts
such as teaching, in this case used to equip more people to work on the
tabernacle.

   Note which of these men's natural talents were passed on to
their descendants. 1 Kings 7:13, 14.


   Natural talents may be converted by the Lord into spiritual gifts.
But sometimes a person is assigned spiritual gifts that are entirely
different from natural talents. Sometimes the two are complementary
to each other. The difference is that spiritual gifts are designed to be
used for the advancement of the kingdom of God, even when matched
with natural talents. Natural talents alone may be used for personal
gain or as the means of a person's lifework. There is no conflict
between the two sets of gifts. The difference is that spiritual gifts are
specifically assigned by the Holy Spirit.

    As you study the lessons for this quarter, compare your natu-
 ral talents with the spiritual gifts you discover you have. Are
 they the same? If not, are they in any way complementary? Pray
 that the Holy Spirit will guide you as you seek to evaluate
 realistically your talents and spiritual gifts.

                                                                        11

FURTHER STUDY: Look up the key texts used in this week's lesson
in a number of Bible commentaries: Romans 12:1-8; Ephesians 4:12;
and 1 Peter 4:10. What do you learn from these resources? Look up
the names Bezalel, Oholiab, and Huram in a Bible dictionary.
   Read "Results of Transgression," Prophets and Kings, pp. 61-74.
Notice how people used and misused their gifts and talents.
   Read "Talents," Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 325-365, and con-
sider the following:

                        Talents: the broadest
                             term used



  Gifts of the Spirit —p. 328              Endowments—p. 328
  Special gifts—p. 327                      Original  Acquired
  "Goods of heaven"—p. 327                  Natural   Spiritual


   Huram was a skilled artisan. But natural talents, no matter how
effective, can be a real problem if not consecrated to the Lord. Writing
of Huram, Ellen White remarks: "The very fibers of his being had been
inwrought with principles of selfishness, which were revealed in his
grasping for the highest wages. And gradually these wrong principles
came to be cherished by his associates. As they labored with him day
after day, and yielded to the inclination to compare his wages with
their own, they began to lose sight of the holy character of their work,
and to dwell upon the difference between their wages and his. Gradu-
ally they lost their spirit of self-denial, and fostered a spirit of covet-
ousness. The result was a demand for higher wages, which was granted
them."—Selected Messages, book 2, pp. 175, 176.

SUMMARY: In this week's lesson we reviewed some of the key
information in the Bible about spiritual gifts. Disciples are expected to
use faithfully their assigned gifts for the advancement of God's work.
Paul illustrates the interrelationships of the various gifts by comparing
them to the coordinated functioning of the human body. They are
given for the benefit of all and serve to unify the testimony of the
church. Some people are given training gifts designed to equip church
members for the work of ministry. Sometimes gifts enhance natural
abilities, and sometimes they are entirely different. It all depends on
the endowment given by the Holy Spirit.

                                Neumoel Stina

         It was Friday evening; I was finishing a Week of Prayer in a
     city in southern Brazil. I had preached four times a day at two
     different locations. Several young people had given their lives to
     God, but one young man seemed to resist the Holy Spirit.
         Henrique and his girlfriend had come to all four meetings every
     day, hearing the same sermons twice each day. I prayed fervently
     to win Henrique to Jesus, but he never responded to the appeals.
         I returned to my room on Thursday night frustrated. "God,
     what am I doing wrong that I cannot lead this young man to You?"
     I pleaded. I could not sleep, so I read my Bible and prayed for this
     young man.
         After the evening meeting Henrique planned to drive to his
     parents' home 50 miles away. But along the desolate road, his car
     had a flat tire. He discovered that his jack was broken. No one was
     around. to help him Fearful, he locked himself into his car and lay
     down to await dawn. He tried to sleep, but could not. He kept
     remembering phrases from the week's sermons: "God is willing to
     accept you. . . Ask God once, and He will come."
         For the first time in his life Henrique prayed. He got out of the
     car, and knelt down on the road. "God, I don't know how to pray,
     but if what the pastor said is true, come and help me, please." He
     got back into the car to wait what might happen.
         Within minutes a car pulled off the road in front of him. A tall,
     strong man stepped out and offered his help. Henrique told him
     what had happened. The man changed the tire, then put his enor-
      mous hand on Henrique's shoulder and said: "Young man, I came
      to tell you that God loves you. . ." Henrique was startled and
      asked the man his name, but the man only repeated his words,
     "Don't forget, God loves you." Then he turned toward his car.
          Henrique got into his car, wiped tears from his eyes, then
      looked up to wave at the man who had helped him. But no one was
      there. No man, no car. Henrique had not heard a car door slam or
      an engine start up. He drove home in awed silence.
          Henrique was the first to arrive at the church on Friday evening.
      He ran to open the car door when I arrived, and quickly asked,
      "Pastor, can you baptize me?" Startled, I listened to his story.
          The following year I baptized Henrique, and a short time later I
      married him and his girlfriend. Today they are faithful members of
      the church.

          The Holy Spirit and
            Spiritual Gifts




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Acts 1:1-26; 2:1, 2; 13:2-4;
Ps. 68:28-35; John 16.

   MEMORY TEXT: "If you then, though you are evil, know how
   to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your
   Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!"
   (Luke 11:13, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: The Holy Spirit is the effective agent in accom-
plishing the work of the church in the world.

   THE HOLY SPIRIT IS ASSIGNED BY HEAVEN as the active
agent of Christ, the Head of the church on earth. The Holy Spirit
launched and energized the early church (Acts 1:8). He gave people
the instantaneous ability to speak in languages not their own (Acts
2:4), turned frightened disciples into bold preachers (Acts 4:1-3),
directly indicated certain people for certain missions (Acts 13:2),
solved doctrinal problems (Acts 15:28), prohibited missionaries from
entering certain areas (Acts 16:6), directed them to other areas (Acts
16:10), and was the power behind all kinds of miracles (Acts 19).
   Adventists tend to focus on the early and latter rains. We sometimes
neglect to consider the work of the Holy Spirit right now. "Just prior to
His leaving His disciples for the heavenly courts, Jesus encouraged
them with the promise of the Holy Spirit. This promise belongs as
much to us as it did to them."—Testimonies to Ministers,
p. 174.
   This week's lesson reviews some of the Holy Spirit's roles as they
relate to the topic of spiritual gifts.

THE HOLY SPIRIT: CHURCH ADMINISTRATOR (Acts 13:2-4).

   Someone once remarked that the Holy Spirit has His home and
office in the church. Though Jesus was speaking primarily to individu-
als, He may also have had the church in mind when He said, "If anyone
loves me, he will obey my teaching. My Father will love him, and we
will come to him and make our home with him" (John 14:23, NIV).
    The book of Acts portrays the Holy Spirit as a presiding presence in
the early church. He was in command. He directly indicated to the
church what to do in many situations. This is what Paul referred to
when he told Timothy: "Do not neglect your gift, which was given you
through a prophetic message when the body of elders laid their hands
on you" (1 Tim. 4:14, NIV).

  Have you ever sincerely felt that the Holy Spirit was leading
you or calling you to a particular ministry? How did you respond?
What was your assurance that your conviction was truly from the
Holy Spirit?


   "The same power that sustained the patriarchs, that gave Caleb and
Joshua faith and courage, and that made the work of the apostolic
church effective, has upheld God's faithful children in every succeed-
ing age. . . . And today God is still using His church to make known
His purpose in the earth."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 53.

   How does the Holy Spirit's role as church administrator affect
individual church members? John 14:17, 23; Acts 19:1-7.


   Luke mentions the Holy Spirit 57 times in the book of Acts and
carefully notes that every major decision of the young church was
made under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The disciples waited for
the Holy Spirit before beginning to preach. He fell on each new group
of believers: on Jews (Acts 4:31), on Samaritans (8:17), on Gentiles
(10:44), and on some of John the Baptist's disciples (19:6). The Spirit
personally directed each major advance of the church. He sent Philip
into the desert to meet the Ethiopian (8:29), to set apart missionaries
(13:2), to guide the first major church council (15:1-8), and to help
plan Paul's itineraries (13:4; 16:6).

    How can church members make way for the Holy Spirit to be
 the administrator of the church today? What attitudes or ac-
 tions might frustrate the work of the Holy Spirit?


                                                                     15

THE HOLY SPIRIT: SOURCE OF POWER (Acts 1:8).

   The Holy Spirit is the source of power for the church and its
members. He is the source of spiritual power for individual Christians
and the source of successful ministry by the church as a collective
enterprise. The power that attended the coming of the Holy Spirit at
Pentecost is the same power we need today. "The Spirit awaits our
demand and reception."—Christ 's Object Lessons, p. 121.

   Read Acts 2:2. What does the word suddenly communicate to
you? What evidence was given that this was the fulfillment of Acts
1:8?


   Jesus promised the disciples power (Acts 1:8). It arrived on the
Day of Pentecost in the person of the Holy Spirit. Only with this
power could a small group of people preach the gospel throughout the
world. Paul wrote that the gospel is the "power of God unto salvation"
(Rom. 1:16). The gospel is not an undercover operation. The gospel
ought to be out on the streets, its message shouted from the housetops.
The Holy Spirit is the power behind the dynamic Christian activism of
those who proclaim the gospel.

  Read Psalm 68:28-35. This psalm was often sung at Pentecost.
List some of the ways the power of God was identified in the
ancient Israelite worship services.


   There are a number of Greek words for power. One is kratos, which
may imply physical strength. Another, exousia, implies a ruler's au-
thority. Jesus used this word when He said, "All power is given unto
me in heaven and in earth" (Matt. 28:18). The word used in Acts 1:8,
"You shall receive power" (NIV) is dunamis, a word that implies both
explosive energy and the continual steady power of a dynamo. The
Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures uses dunamis a number of
times in Psalm 68:28-35. The Old Testament Israelite worshipers
pleaded for God to show His power. On the Day of Pentecost it arrived
in a new and dynamic way. Suddenly, the disciples were "gifted" by
the Holy Spirit to do what they could not do under normal circum-
stances. The church today draws on that same power for personal
Christian experience and to expand its mission of taking the gospel to
whoever has not yet heard it.

   Think back over your own life story. Describe what happened
 when you experienced the power of the Holy Spirit.

THE HOLY SPIRIT: TEACHER (John 16:12-15).

   Besides being church administrator and the source of power, the
Holy Spirit is also the church's principal Teacher. "The Counselor, the
Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all
things and will remind you of everything I have said to you" (John
14:26, NW). Jesus has perpetuated His earthly teaching ministry through
the Spirit. (See Sons and Daughters of God, p. 282.) This teaching
office is as dynamic as was the experience of Pentecost. "God can
teach you more in one moment by His Holy Spirit than you could learn
from the great men of the earth."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 119.

  How did Jesus outline the teaching role of the Holy Spirit?
John 16:12-15. Notice the various facets of teaching and learning
mentioned in these verses.


   The Holy Spirit as teacher (1) brings out new insights, (2) instructs
in "what is yet to come," (3) brings glory to God by helping us
understand more completely, and (4) draws knowledge from God's
fountain and shares it with us. The Holy Spirit illuminates our minds in
two principal ways: (1) as we study the Scriptures and (2) through the
gift of effective teaching given to certain church members.

   What kind of teaching system did Paul advocate for passing on
religious knowledge? Acts 19:9, 10 (compare 1 Tim. 4:11-13;
2 Tim. 2:1, 2).


   It has been estimated that the people who regularly attended Paul's
teaching sessions in Ephesus would have received the equivalent of
two years of Bible-school education.

  In Paul's case, how did his spiritual gifts become ministries?
Acts 9:15; 19:8 (compare 1 Tim. 2:7; 2 Tim 1:11; Titus 1:3).


   Paul says that he was "appointed" to these ministries and told to use
them with a specific target audience in mind, non-Jews. These minis-
tries correspond to the spiritual gifts chosen for Paul by the Holy
Spirit.

   What has the Holy Spirit taught you? What do you feel you
 would not have learned without the aid of the Holy Spirit?


                                                                     17

THE HOLY SPIRIT: ASSIGNER OF GIFTS (1 Cor. 12:11).

   People have many ideas about how a person receives or is assigned
his or her spiritual gifts. Some believe that the church decides who gets
which gifts. Others feel that election to church office is the same as
receiving a particular gift. Some people believe that only their pastor
has spiritual gifts and that church members are supposed to listen and
do whatever the pastor says. Others believe that anyone can do any-
thing, and no one has any authority over another.

   Who assigns spiritual gifts to people? 1 Cor. 12:11.


   Spiritual gifts are the tools the Holy Spirit uses to do the work of the
kingdom. We are all responsible for turning our gifts into ministries
that will advance the work of the kingdom.

   Read 1 Corinthians 12:11 carefully: "All these are activated by
one and the same Spirit, who allots to each one individually just as
the Spirit chooses" (NRSV). Fill in the following blanks:

   1. The gifts are promised "according to his                          .91

   2. They are given for

   The assignment of gifts by the Holy Spirit is designed to advance
the Lord's work. The church is set up as a corporate body to do the
work of the kingdom by organizing the members' gifts into effective
ministries. In this sense, the church has the authority of the Holy Spirit
to "administer" the collective gifts of the members.

   What does Paul say about the attitude that should accompany
the bestowal of spiritual gifts? Rom. 12:3.


   This is the key to the issue. The effective use of spiritual gifts
depends on a person's Christian character. The possession of a par-
ticular gift or gifts is a measure of responsibility before God to do the
work of the kingdom in a sweet, compassionate, and dynamic Chris-
tian spirit.

    Think carefully about your attitude toward using your gifts
 in the church. Does it reflect the servant attitude of Jesus as
 outlined in Philippians 2:5-11? If not, how can His attitude
 become yours?

THE HOLY SPIRIT AND INTERCESSORY PRAYER (Matt. 7:7).

   The arrival of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost was no accident. The
Lord planned to unveil Him in a new way at that moment in history
because the time was opportune. (See The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 38,
39.) A large number of people from all over the known world were in
the city.
   Without the right kind of people to witness for Christ, the outpour-
ing of the Holy Spirit could not have occurred. The Holy Spirit en-
ables and equips people to work for Christ; he doesn't usually do all
the work Himself. The Holy Spirit responds to the intercessory prayers
of God's people for spiritual power.

   What does James say about intercessory prayer? James 1:5.


   Intercessory prayer is a special kind of prayer. It requests specific
things from the Lord, based on what He has promised. The Lord does
not withhold what He has promised, but He does not always confer it
unless we ask for it.
   There are seven levels of prevailing intercessory prayer:
   Level 1:     Ask                            Matt. 7:7
   Level 2:     Seek                           Matt. 7:7
   Level 3:     Knock                          Matt. 7:7
   Level 4:     Fast                           Ps. 35:13; Mark 9:29
   Level 5:     Present a specific burden      Neh. 2:2-5
   Level 6:     Wrestle in Prayer              Luke 22:44; Col. 4:12;
                                                Gen. 32:22-30
   Level 7:     Battle with Satan              Matt. 4:1-11
   Some or all levels may be involved when praying for a specific
issue. The Lord honors these prayers, and the Holy Spirit goes into
action on our behalf.

   What does Ecclesiastes 4:12 imply about the effectiveness of
intercessory-prayer groups?


   The experience of the disciples in the upper room before the Day of
Pentecost is an example of intercessory prayer in action. Ellen White
outlines the disciples' experience in chapter 4, entitled "Pentecost," in
The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 36, 37.

   Why not begin an intercessory-prayer ministry in your church?
 You will be amazed at the results.

                                                                     19
Friday                                                 January 10
FURTHER STUDY: John 14 records that Jesus told His disciples
about the coming of the Holy Spirit. Read the chapter for an under-
standing of the Holy Spirit's role as Jesus portrayed it. Also read The
Acts of the Apostles, chapters 1-5, to receive a more complete picture
of the Holy Spirit's role in the life of the church after Jesus' ascension.
    The Index to the Writings of Ellen White has 59 columns on the
Holy Spirit. The following list indicates some of the ways the Holy
Spirit is active in the church and in the lives of individual members:
     1. Gives mental power (Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 306).
    2. Gives healing power (Messages to Young People, p. 30).
     3. Renews motives and affections (The Acts of the Apostles,
        p. 284).
    4. Gives the ability to accomplish good works (Thoughts From the
        Mount of Blessing, p. 80).
     5. Gives supernatural strength (Gospel Workers, p. 286).
    6. Brings unity to the church (Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 28, 227).
     7. Gives us training that fits us for heaven (Testimonies, vol. 7,
        p. 273).

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Notice that the decision recorded in Acts 15:28 was made by
     "the Holy Spirit" and "us." Now, think about the decision-
     making process and organizational plan used in your church.
     It is easy to say that the Holy Spirit is indirectly involved,
     because we may sometimes ask Him in a more-or-less rou-
     tine way to bless our endeavors. On the other hand, under
     what circumstances will the Holy Spirit be directly involved
     as He was in Acts 15?

   2. Can your Sabbath School class lead out in organizing an
      intercessory-prayer ministry in your church? Discuss with
      the class how this ministry might be initiated and carried on
      in your church.

SUMMARY: This week's lesson dealt with the role of the Holy Spirit
as the active agent, assigned by God the Father, to be the administrator
of the church on earth. For both the church body and individual
Christians, He is the source of power and the primary teacher, illumi-
nating minds, leading them to truth. He assigns spiritual gifts, both to
individual members and to the church as a body. Intercessory prayer,
based on claiming the promises of God, is the effective instrument the
church should employ to invite the Holy Spirit to work on its behalf.

                     True Freedom in Jesus
                         Akouta Sylvestre

    I never heard about Jesus while I was growing up. Our
village in the tiny country of Benin in West Africa refused to
allow Christians to enter. One Christian church tried to estab-
lish a mission there once, but village leaders drove them out.
    When I was 13 years old I went to visit my mother's
relatives in another village. To my great surprise, I found
some of my uncles and aunts listening to a young man who
was speaking about Jesus. I sat down and listened with them.
This was the first time I had ever heard anything about Jesus,
and I was profoundly impressed.
    I returned home overjoyed with what I had learned. In my
zeal to share what I had learned, I went so far as to discredit
voodoo, our country's major religion, saying it was powerless.
Immediately someone informed my grandfather, because I
was staying with him. My grandfather didn't say a word to
me then, because he was preparing himself for a big voodoo
ceremony, during which food was presented to our ances-
tors, who had supposedly been fasting for many years. On the
day of the ceremony I refused to go near or touch anything
associated with the feast. My grandfather ordered some men
to grab me and beat me for my refusal to take part. Three days
later they beat me again.
    I was put out of Grandfather's house, but because of my young
age, I was taken back under the condition that I would not prac-
tice Christianity. Then my aunt, my grandfather's youngest daughter,
became seriously ill. They tried all the various occult remedies
and ceremonies, but my aunt remained desperately sick.
    In desperation the family asked some Christians to pray for her,
and she recovered. Healing has great power in our minds, and my
 grandfather consented when my aunt wanted to become a
 Christian. This opened wide the door for me, as well, praise God!
    I visited several Christian churches in search of one that
 taught the truths of the Bible. While I was searching, I discov-
 ered a Christian radio station that taught the whole Bible. I
                                                                       0
 wrote to the station, called Adventist World Radio, and they
 helped me find the Adventist Church. At last I had found
 what I was looking for! Now the burden of my heart is to
 reach the others in my village and in my country who still
 suffer under the influence of evil spirits and don't understand
 true freedom in Jesus.

            Spiritual Gifts and
               the Church




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Kings 10; Exod. 18:13-27;
Ezekiel 1; 1 Timothy 3; Eph. 4:1-16.

  MEMORY TEXT: "The body is a unit, though it is made up of
  many parts; and though all its parts are many, they form one
  body. So it is with Christ. For we were all baptized by one Spirit
  into one body" (1 Corinthians 12:12, 13, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Spiritual gifts are the tools the Lord has given
His church to do the work of the kingdom. When spiritual gifts are
employed harmoniously, according to biblical organizational patterns,
the church is able to evangelize the world effectively.

   ORGANIZING THE CHURCH. The Bible presents a number of
models of church organization. There are also different ways to orga-
nize the outreach of the church. In Old Testament times, Israelites
seldom went out to other people as missionaries. The Lord used a
"centripetal" system of soul winning. Centripetal means that some-
thing starts at the edges and moves to the center. Nations would
observe Israel's prosperity and say, "Surely this great nation is a wise
and understanding people" (Deut. 4:6). The queen of Sheba's visit to
Solomon is an example. (See 1 Kings 10.) The New Testament indi-
cates that the church is now called to go out rather than wait for people
to come to it. (See Acts 1:8.) "The disciples were to work earnestly for
souls, giving to all the invitation of mercy. They were not to wait for
the people to come to them; they were to go to the people with their
message."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 28. This week we consider the
place of spiritual gifts in the organizational program of the church.

ORGANIZING THE CHURCH FOR ACTION (Exod. 18:13-27).

   Some congregations are beautifully organized. Seldom is anything
out of place, overlooked, or unprepared. Others are so disorganized
that almost everyone and everything are in a state of more or less
constant bewilderment and chaos. Some find a happy medium and
manage to get most things done with a minimum of confusion. Many
don't really know whether they have an organizational pattern. They
limp along and assume that everything will be all right. Some churches
have aggressive outreach ministries, some have none.

  What does the Bible have to say about church organizational
patterns? How did Moses' father-in-law suggest Moses reduce his
workload and delegate his authority? Exod. 18:13-27.


   Israel's organizational system is one that works well in a setting that
involves circles of influence spread out over large areas. Each level is
responsible to the next higher level, and the communication flows
from one level to the next. The Adventist system, consisting of local
church, conference/mission, union, division, and General Conference,
is an example of this kind of organizational pattern.

  What kind of organizational pattern did Ezekiel see in vision?
Ezekiel 1.


   This is a different kind of organizational pattern. Here "wheels"
work within wheels, move back and forth, up and down, all sustained
by the power of God and managed by the Holy Spirit. "There is at
work a wheel within a wheel. Apparently the complication of machin-
ery is so intricate that man can see only a complete entanglement. But
the divine hand, as seen by the prophet Ezekiel, is placed upon the
wheels, and every part moves in complete harmony, each doing its
specified work, yet with individual freedom of action."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 4, p. 1161.
   This type of organizational pattern is applicable to a local church.
In many ways it corresponds to the concept of spiritual gifts outlined
by Paul, each doing its specified work, yet with individual freedom of
action. (See Rom. 12:4, 5; 1 Cor. 12:4-7.)

   Take a look at the organizational pattern of your local church.
 What elements of each of the above models can you identify?
 How well do these organizational patterns work in your local
 church? conference? mission?

THE MINISTRY OF ALL BELIEVERS (1 Peter 2:9, 10).

   During the Middle Ages, the clergy claimed that there should be a
division between laity and clergy. The clergy enjoyed a higher status
than the laity. Out of this concept and practice grew the idea that
clergy are the authority in the church and that the work of the church is
done by them. Members are mostly spectators who observe whatever
the clergy does, and they do whatever the clergy mandates.

  What does Peter say about the Christian church and its mem-
bers? 1 Peter 2:9, 10 (compare Exod. 19:5, 6).


   The word laity comes from the Latin laicus, which in turn comes
from the Greek word laos, which simply means "people." In medieval
times it came to be used in contrast to "clericus," referring to the
official priesthood. A writer named Stephen of Tournai, for instance,
said that there were "lower" people and "higher" people, each with a
different reward in heaven. (See Gottfried Oosterwal, Mission: Pos-
sible [Nashville: Southern Publishing Association, 1972], p. 105.) But
in God's sight all church members are part of "a royal priesthood, a
holy nation, a people belonging to God" (1 Peter 2:9, NIV).

   What are the spiritual characteristics of this royal priesthood?
1 Peter 2:11, 12.


   Members of this royal priesthood dignify it by living lives in
accordance with its precepts. They recognize the lordship of Jesus
(1 Peter 2:4-8) and focus on declaring His glory (verse 9). They
become "living stones" in a church built by the Master Architect, who
is Himself the cornerstone sustaining the entire operation (verse 7).

    Read Matthew 28:16-20; Acts 1:8; and Ephesians 4:12. If there
is any difference at all between clergy and laity, what is it?


   The ministry of all believers is often equated today with the word
discipleship. All Christians are called to discipleship. "If we are Chris-
tians, this work will be our delight. No sooner is one converted than
there is born within him a desire to make known to others what a
precious friend he has found in Jesus."—The Desire of Ages, p. 141.

    Think about your personal role in the church. Has it been
 active or passive? Are you a spectator or a player?

SPIRITUAL GIFTS AND CHURCH AUTHORITY (1 Timothy 3).

   In a large organization like the church, some kind of authority
system is needed. Someone has to take the initiative and make deci-
sions. Under Jethro's system, Moses had the final word (Exod. 18:26).
In Ezekiel's vision of the wheels, the entire mechanism was managed
by the Holy Spirit (Ezek. 1:20).
   In the early Christian church, the Holy Spirit played an active and
recognized role in the decision-making processes, but usually in com-
bination with the church body. For instance, at the first council of the
Christian church, James, the chairperson, announced the decision as
seeming "good to the Holy Spirit and to us" (Acts 15:28, NIV).

   Read the following texts, and outline the various leadership
elements of the early church organizational system: Acts 6:1-7;
1 Tim. 3:1-10; 5:17; Titus 1:6, 7.


   Three Greek words are used for the leading offices in the early
church: presbuteros, translated "elder"; episkopos, translated "bishop"
or "overseer"; and diakonos, translated "deacon." Presbuteros was
used in Jewish circles as a term of rank or office. In the Christian
church, it was used for those who presided over assemblies. Presbuteros
is used in Scripture interchangeably with episkopos, which is used in
the sense of superintendent. Diakonos is used in the sense of one who
serves, one who does the bidding of another.

   How did someone attain any of these positions in the New
Testament church? Acts 14:23; 15:22; 1 Tim. 4:14; Titus 1:5.
Besides guiding these officers, how else did the Holy Spirit admin-
ister the early church? Acts 13:1-3.


   There is a close connection between the assignment of spiritual
gifts and the assignment of officers. Paul and Barnabas were directly
called by the Holy Spirit through the prophetic office (Acts 13:1-3)
and given the missionary gift, as well as other gifts. But the decision
was confirmed by the church body (Acts 13:3). Timothy's experience
was the same. He was called through a prophetic message, which was
confirmed by the church body (1 Tim. 4:14).

    Our church has followed to some extent this New Testament
 system. What are the differences and similarities between our
 system and that of the early church?


                                                                     25

SPIRITUAL GIFTS AND THE ADVENTIST CHURCH (1 Cor.
12:1).

    Many Christian denominations believe that spiritual gifts, espe-
cially those called "power gifts," or "sign gifts," ceased with the last of
the apostles. Seventh-day Adventists do not accept this view. In fact,
we are among the leading proponents of the belief that spiritual gifts
still function in today's church.

   What does Joel 2:28, 29 say about spiritual gifts in the last days,
especially the gift of prophecy?


   J. N. Andrews, Adventist pioneer, wrote: "Those who reject the
work of the Spirit of God under plea that the Scriptures are sufficient,
do deny and reject all that part of the Bible which reveals the office
and work of the Holy Spirit."—Review and Herald, Feb. 15, 1870.

   How is the gift of prophecy especially connected with the clos-
ing work of the gospel era? Rev. 12:17; 19:10.


   Ellen White specifically indicated the importance of this topic for
the Adventist Church: "God has put men and women in possession of
precious gifts. To different ones He gives different gifts. Not all have
the same strength of character or the same depth of knowledge. But
each one is to use his gifts in the Master's service, however small this
gift may seem to be. The faithful steward trades wisely on the goods
entrusted to him."—The Signs of the Times, Feb. 24, 1904.

  Read Ephesians 4. What principles of spiritual gifts and church
organization are laid out in this chapter?


   "There is need for a variety of gifts in the Lord's work. Read
carefully the fourth chapter of Ephesians. The entire chapter is a
description of the Lord's manner of working. . . . [Ephesians 4:11-13
quoted.] Every gift is to be acknowledged as essential to the success of
the work." —Ellen G. White, Letter 8, 1899, p. 6 (Manuscript Re-
leases, vol. 11, p. 276).

   How do you feel about the manifestation of spiritual gifts,
 especially the gift of prophecy, in the Seventh-day Adventist
 Church? How would you rate your personal "confidence level"?

SPIRITUAL GIFTS IN ACTION: PAUL AND BARNABAS (2 Tim.
1:11; Acts 9:27).

   Paul and Barnabas worked together for many years. They had
different gifts that complemented one another.

   What were Paul's principal spiritual gifts? 2 Tim. 1:11; 2:2;
Rom. 11:13; Acts 22:21. How did he describe his missionary gift?
1 Cor. 9:19-23.


   The missionary gift (Acts 22:21) involves the ability to use other
spiritual gifts in a multicultural context. Paul's ministry made possible
the fulfillment of the mandate in Acts 1:8. Notice how the Lord used
various gifts:

  Person People Group                Gifts                Texts
Peter      Palestinian Jews Evangelist              Gal. 2:7
Peter,     Diaspora Jews Evangelists                Acts 2; 4:31; 6
Stephen
Philip     Samaritans        Evangelist, miracles Acts 8
Paul       Gentiles          Missionary,          2 Tim. 1:11
                             evangelist, teacher
 Barnabas Gentiles           Missionary, teacher, Acts 9:26, 27; 13:1
                             helps, prophecy

  Trace through the biblical record of Barnabas. Notice how he is
always helping someone else succeed. Acts 9:27; 13:1; 15:36-39;
Gal. 2:13.


   Barnabas had the gifts of prophecy and teaching (Acts 13:1), but he
also had the gift of helps. He took Paul under his wing (Acts 9:27),
went to Tarsus to find him, initiated him into ministry, went with him
on his missionary ventures, and eventually took second place to Paul.
(Notice the change in the order of names between Acts 13:2, 7 and
verses 42, 43.) Barnabas supported John Mark and eventually restored
him to Paul's good graces (2 Tim. 4:11).

    How would you feel if the Lord gave you only the gift of helps
 rather than some major leadership gifts? Compare your answer
 with 1 Corinthians 12:14-30.


                                                                      27

FURTHER STUDY: Review 1 Timothy 3 for an overview of early
church organization. Read The Acts of the Apostles, chapters 3, 11,
and 16, for more information on early church organizational systems
and the use of spiritual gifts.

    Wheels Within Wheels. "The striking feature of divine operations
is the accomplishment of the greatest work that can be done in our
world by very simple means. It is God's plan that every part of His
government shall depend on every other part, the whole as a wheel
within a wheel, working with entire harmony. He moves upon human
forces, causing His Spirit to touch invisible chords, and the vibration
rings to the extremity of the universe."—Evangelism, p. 93.
    "Perfect order is brought out of the confusion. Every wheel works
in its right place, in perfect harmony with every other part of the
machinery."—Christian Leadership, p. 26.
    Outreach Strategies. "The disciples were to begin their work
where they were. The hardest and most unpromising field was not to
be passed by. So every one of Christ's workers is to begin where he is.
In our own families may be souls hungry for sympathy, starving for the
bread of life. There may be children to be trained for Christ. There are
heathen at our very doors. Let us do faithfully the work that is nearest.
Then let our efforts be extended as far as God's hand may lead the
way. The work of many may appear to be restricted by circumstances;
but wherever it is, if performed with faith and diligence it will be felt to
the uttermost parts of the earth. Christ's work when upon earth ap-
peared to be confined to a narrow field, but multitudes from all lands
heard His message. God often uses the simplest means to accomplish
the greatest results. It is His plan that every part of His work shall
depend on every other part, as a wheel within a wheel, all acting in
harmony. The humblest worker, moved by the Holy Spirit, will touch
invisible chords, whose vibrations will ring to the ends of the earth,
and make melody through eternal ages."—Ellen G. White, Review and
Herald, October 9, 1913.

SUMMARY: The Lord outlines various organizational systems in the
Bible for use by the church. The New Testament connects these orga-
nizational systems with spiritual gifts and the call to discipleship.
Every Christian is called to discipleship and effective ministry within
the body of the church.

                                    Eugene Hsu

           In the Chinese Bible Psalm 68:11 is translated, "The Lord gave
       the word: great was the company of women that published it."
       When the Communists took over China in the early 1950s, pas-
       tors were arrested and church schools were closed. Women stepped
       in to fill the needs. Zhou Hui Ying, a local church-school teacher,
       had lost her job, and the church had lost its pastor. So she bravely
       took up the work of leading the local congregation.
           Because she was neither licensed nor ordained to preach, Sis-
       ter Zhou was not recognized by the government as a pastor and
       received no pay. But she continued to work as a Bible worker,
       suffering indignities and material losses. Then her husband left
       her to rear their three children alone, on the meager gifts and
       support from believers..
           But the Lord stood by her, and she gained strength from prayer.
       She nurtured her small group of faithful Adventists who met
       Sabbath by Sabbath in her home or theirs. She encouraged and
       supported them through government house searches and church
       closures. Fearful that her Bible and Spirit of Prophecy books
       would be confiscated, she wrapped them in plastic bags and
       buried them in her yard.
           When the government finally reopened churches, Sister Zhou
       was not permitted to conduct religious services openly unless she
       agreed to allow Sundaykeeping ministers to speak every other
       week. This she refused to do, and it was many years before the
       Chinese government withdrew their accusations against her.
           For the past 13 years Sister Zhou has served as Bible worker
        for her church. Under her leadership the church has grown from a
        handful to 200 in 1986, and to more than 1,000 today.
           Today, at 82 years of age, Sister Zhou continues to serve full
        time as senior pastor of her church, one of the largest and stron-
        gest Adventist congregations in China. Under her guidance the
        church provides leadership training for lay workers and literature
        work throughout China. Truly she lives up to her name, which
        means, "Shining Everywhere."

       Spiritual Gifts From
      Pentecost to the Present
                     0



Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Joel 2:28-32; 1 Cor. 1:6, 7;
1 Thess. 5:19-21; Matt. 24:24.

   MEMORY TEXT: "And afterward, I will pour out my Spirit
   on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old
   men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions" (Joel
   2:28, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: From its inception, the Seventh-day Adventist
Church has accepted the view that spiritual gifts are functional in any
age. Since 1980, we have included in Fundamental Belief No. 16, all
the spiritual gifts as applicable to the life of the church today.

   ARE SPIRITUAL GIFTS STILL FUNCTIONAL? Many churches
believe in the authenticity of gifts such as helps, intercessory prayer,
etc., but not in the so-called "sign" or "power" gifts such as prophecy,
healing, and speaking in tongues. This view is called cessationism.
   On the other hand, churches and groups that form part of the
contemporary charismatic movement take the position that sign gifts
are not only valid, but particularly important in today's world.
   Seventh-day Adventists have always believed that all spiritual gifts
are functional in any age, that the gift of prophecy is particularly
relevant to the remnant church, and that other sign or power gifts will
be notably manifested during the latter rain. But Adventists question
the application of some "gifts" in contemporary denominations, espe-
cially speaking in tongues and faith healing.
   This week we trace the history of spiritual gifts from the early
church to our day and outline why Seventh-day Adventists believe
spiritual gifts are still functional.

SPIRITUAL GIFTS THEN AND NOW (Joel 2:28-32).

   There is a school of thought called cessationism that holds that the
gifts of the Spirit, particularly the gifts of tongues, healing, and proph-
ecy, were special endowments given to people only during New Testa-
ment times. The claim is that once the canon of Scripture closed,
spiritual gifts were no longer needed. Adventists have never accepted
that view. Our understanding is based on the chronology indicated by
the phrase "And afterward" in Joel 2:28 (NIV) and the phrase "when
perfection comes, the imperfect disappears" in 1 Corinthians 13:10
(NIV).

   Analyze the way Peter applied Joel 2:28-32 on the Day of
Pentecost. Acts 2:14-21. To whom did he apply the prophecy? Acts
2:39.


   The Hebrew for "afterward" in Joel 2:28 is a common expression
referring to some time in the future. The Greek of Acts 2:17 uses the
word eschatos in the phrase "in the last days." Eschatos means "last in
time or space." The English word eschatology (study of last things) is
derived from this word. The early Christians saw their day as "the last
days," because Jesus had told them to proclaim the gospel worldwide
and then He would return (Acts 1:6-8). So Peter applied the prophecy
to his day. But Peter's era was not the final "last days."

  What did Paul mean in 1 Corinthians 13:10 by his words "when
perfection comes, the imperfect disappears"? See 1 Cor. 15:50-55.


   Notice Paul's series of contrasts in 1 Corinthians 13:

                   Now                       Then
             Prophecies               Will cease
             Tongues                  Will be stilled
             Knowledge                Will pass away
             We know in part          Shall know fully

   When is "then"? The word perfect (1 Cor. 13:10) is the Greek word
teleios, which means "complete when it gets to the end." On this earth,
we never attain total "completeness." When Jesus comes, the saved
are re-created.
   Since all spiritual gifts are still valid, why don't we hear more about
them in our church?

                                                                        31

THE PERMANENCE OF SPIRITUAL GIFTS (1 Cor. 1:6, 7).

   Spiritual gifts are an integral part of the dispensation of the Holy
Spirit, the span of time between Pentecost and the second coming.
Focusing particularly on the gift of prophecy, A. G. Daniells wrote:
"When sin had broken direct communion between heaven and earth,
God gave the prophetic gift to men, vouchsafing it to His church, and
that gift has never been permanently withdrawn since its bestowal."
—A. G. Daniells, The Abiding Gift of Prophecy (Boise, Idaho: Pacific
Press Pub. Assn., 1936), p. 11. That excellent summary applies equally
to all gifts of the Spirit.

    How does 1 Corinthians 1:6, 7 confirm the position that spir-
itual gifts are valid and active in the church today? What other
evidence is there that spiritual gifts, including the "sign" gifts, are
still active today? Eph. 4:7-13; Rev. 12:17.

SPIRITUAL GIFTS IN CHURCH HISTORY (2 Peter 1:19-21).

   Historical records show that throughout its history the Christian
church recognized spiritual gifts as a continuing, legitimate operation
of the Holy Spirit. Today's lesson will trace some instances of the
appearance of spiritual gifts. See Friday's lesson for more details.
   As power passed into the hands of a church hierarchy, eventually
resulting in the formation of the papal system, the official church
tended to identify spiritual gifts with schismatic movements.
   The Early Christian Centuries. At least two early church-related
documents, The Didache and The Shepherd of Hermes, mention on-
going spiritual gifts. Both documents use almost the same words as
does Paul in listing the various gifts. Justin Martyr, who lived some 60
years after the death of John, the last of the apostles, says: "The
prophetical gifts . . . remain with us, even to the present time."
—Quoted in Ronald Kydd, Charismatic Gifts in the Early Church
(Peabody, Mass.: Hendrickson Publishers, 1984), p. 27.
    Third and Fourth Centuries. A group called the Montanists claimed
to have the sign gifts in their midst. Other writers of the time, even
those opposed to Montanism, do not seem to regard the appearance of
these spiritual gifts as either inconsistent or impious.
    The Middle Ages. The appearance during this time of protesting
groups such as the Waldenses and Huguenots brought a renewed
manifestation of spiritual gifts. According to A. G. Daniells, a contem-
porary observer said of a group in southeastern France: "They were all
people without malice, in whom I perceived nothing that I could
suspect of being their invention."— Quoted in A. G. Daniells, The
Abiding Gift of Prophecy, p. 227.
    Adventists are familiar with the gift of prophecy in our church, and
 Ellen White affirms the continuance of other spiritual gifts: "But the
gifts of the Spirit are promised to every believer according to his need
for the Lord's work. The promise is just as strong and trustworthy now
 as in the days of the apostles. 'These signs shall follow them that
 believe.' This is the privilege of God's children, and faith should lay
 hold on all that it is possible to have as an indorsement of faith."—The
 Desire of Ages, p. 823. Italics supplied.

    Suppose we agree that the Bible teaches that all believers
 have spiritual gifts for ministry. How can you explain why churches
 through the centuries did not include this truth in their central
 teaching? (See Ellen White, The Great Controversy, chapter 3.)

SPIRITUAL GIFTS AND THE LATTER RAIN (Zech. 10:1).

   During the latter rain, spectacular gifts of the Spirit will again be
manifested. "The great work of the gospel is not to close with less
manifestation of the power of God than marked its opening. The
prophecies which were fulfilled in the outpouring of the former rain at
the opening of the gospel are again to be fulfilled in the latter rain at its
close."—The Great Controversy, p. 611.

   Joel describes the latter rain in Joel 2:23, 27-32. Peter applied
this prophecy to Pentecost, the former rain. How do we know it
also applies to the latter rain? Zech. 10:1; Hosea 6:3; Rev. 18:1.


   "Near the close of earth's harvest, a special bestowal of spiritual
grace is promised to prepare the church for the coming of the Son of
man. This outpouring of the Spirit is likened to the falling of the latter
rain; and it is for this added power that Christians are to send their
petitions to the Lord of the harvest 'in the time of the latter rain.' In
response, 'the Lord shall make bright clouds, and give them showers
of rain.' He will cause to come down . . . the rain, the former rain, and
the latter rain.' Zechariah 10:1; Joel 2:23."—The Acts of the Apostles,
p. 55.

  What kind of power and manifestations of spiritual gifts can we
expect during the latter rain? Mark 16:15-20.


   Ellen White cites this passage and describes what will happen
during the latter rain. "Servants of God, with their faces lighted up and
shining with holy consecration, will hasten from place to place to
proclaim the message from heaven. By thousands of voices, all over
the earth, the warning will be given. Miracles will be wrought, the sick
will be healed, and signs and wonders will follow the believers."
—The Great Controversy, p. 612.
   "I saw the latter rain was coming as the midnight cry [The Millerite
Movement], and with ten times the power."—Ellen G. White, Spalding
and Magan Collection, p. 4.
   The latter rain is the last gospel invitation before the close of
probation. It is the ultimate, premillennial call to accept the Lord's
complete system of truth. The Lord will again empower large numbers
of disciples with the sign gifts as evidence of His power.

   Praying for the latter rain to fall is serious business. What
 commitments are involved in praying for the latter rain?

IDENTIFYING COUNTERFEIT GIFTS (1 Thess. 5:19-21).

   Whenever something true appears, Satan supplies a counterfeit.
Spiritual gifts are no exception. For instance, divine healing is all too
easy to falsify. Speaking in tongues is a perennial problem for many
churches. Outbreaks of self-proclaimed prophets and apostles cause
incredible difficulties in many church communions.

   What did Paul say about authenticating spiritual gifts, espe-
cially the gift of prophecy? 1 Thess. 5:19-21. What did Jesus say
about counterfeit signs and wonders? Matt. 24:24.


   There have been periodic outbreaks of Pentecostal-type movements
in Adventist history. An interesting one was the case of a Mr. and Mrs.
Mackin. Visiting Ellen White in 1908, Mr. & Mrs. Mackin related how
they sang in the Spirit, spoke in tongues (in their case unlearned
foreign languages), and cast out demons. Mrs. Mackin also felt she had
the gift of prophecy. Ellen White's response came through a vision.
The Mackins were cautioned that their type of experience usually
brought the cause of God into disrepute. "The Holy Spirit works,"
Ellen White told them, "in a manner that commends itself to the good
judgement of the people."—Selected Messages, book 3,
p. 371.

   What is the relationship of spiritual gifts to the authority of the
Bible? Isa. 8:20; 1 Cor. 14:32, 37 (compare 1 Cor. 15:1, 2; 2 Tim.
1:11-14).


   Spiritual gifts are always governed by the revealed Word of God
and must be exercised only within the boundaries set by the Bible. One
problem with the contemporary charismatic movement is that people's
subjective experiences often replace the Bible as final authority in
their lives. J. N. Andrews put it well: "The Bible expressly teaches that
the existence of these gifts is as necessary to the church of Christ, as
the different members are necessary to the well-being of the body.
While, therefore, the Bible recognizes the gifts of the Spirit, these are
not given to supersede the Bible, nor yet to fill the same place as the
Bible."—Review and Herald, Feb. 15, 1870.

    Have you ever been involved in a religious experience that
 seemed true at first but turned out to be counterfeit? How did
 you come to the conclusion that it was counterfeit?


                                                                      35

and counterfeits, see Selected Messages, book 2, sections I and 11. For
specific information on Pentecostal-type movements within Advent-
ism, see Selected Messages, book 2, pp. 31-39, and George R. Knight,
From 1888 to Apostasy (Hagerstown, Md.: Review and Herald, 1987),
pp. 167-171. For information on the continuing validity of spiritual
gifts, see A. G. Daniells, The Abiding Gift of Prophecy (Boise, Idaho:
Pacific Press Pub. Assn.), 1936. Daniells traces prophecy and other
spiritual gifts through the Bible and history into the twentieth century.
    The fact that some individuals abused spiritual gifts does not mean
that the gifts themselves or faithful believers practicing them were at
fault. Referring to the rise of the Advent movement in later centuries,
Ellen White records: "In every generation God has sent His servants to
rebuke sin, both in the world and in the church. . . . Many reformers, in
entering upon their work, determined to exercise great prudence in
attacking the sins of the church and the nation. They hoped, by the
example of a pure Christian life, to lead the people back to the doc-
trines of the Bible. But the Spirit of God came upon them as it came
upon Elijah, moving him to rebuke the sins of a wicked king and an
apostate people; they could not refrain from preaching the plain utter-
ances of the Bible—doctrines which they had been reluctant to pre-
sent. . . . The words which the Lord gave them they uttered, fearless of
consequences, and the people were compelled to hear the warning."
—The Great Controversy, p. 606.

pp. 611, 612.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Compile a list of evidences that spiritual gifts are still valid
     today. How does this support the Adventist emphasis on the
     gift of prophecy?

   2. How do you account for the fact that it was not until 1980 that
      all spiritual gifts were included in one of our fundamental-
      belief statements?

   3. How does the inclusion of all spiritual gifts in our church's
      belief system affect our concept of ministry and the priest-
      hood of all believers?

SUMMARY: This lesson traces the functioning of spiritual gifts through-
out the centuries. There is strong biblical and historical evidence that
the gifts mentioned in the Bible are still valid today. Spiritual gifts can
be counterfeited. We must take care to follow the Bible's guidance to
ensure that the gifts are exercised correctly.

    511,                   The Datu's Dream
                               Norma Lachica
        Datu ("Chief') Mangol was the illiterate but respected chief
     of a little village in the Philippines. He believed in the gods of
     the mountains, the rocks, the trees, the sun, the harvest; but he
     did not believe in the God of the universe. He would laugh at
     his three wives when he caught them praying, and often tried
     to pry their eyes open in an attempt to stop their prayers.
        One night Datu Mangol had a dream. He saw a narrow path
     with boiling water on one side and fire on the other. He heard a
     voice instructing him to walk on the narrow path. Frightened, he
     hesitated, but the voice urged him to walk in faith, for the God of
     the universe would keep him from falling. Still frightened, Datu
     Mangol decided to go home and prepare for his journey, but the
     voice compelled him to begin his journey at once.
        He began to walk, and soon found himself standing on a
     crossroad, where roads stretched out in every direction. On one
     road he could see a church. The voice asked him which road he
     should take, and Datu Mangol said, "The road to the church." The
     voice assured him that was the way God wanted him to go.
         In Datu Mangol's society dreams have great significance.
     Datu Mangol studied his dream carefully to determine the
     meaning. He decided that God wanted him to attend church.
         A few days later word came that a baptism was scheduled
     in a town several hours away. Datu resolved to attend the
     baptism. He hiked for three hours to the nearest town, and
     then joined other believers for the six-hour jeepney ride to the
      place where the baptism was to be held. He asked for baptism
      and enrolled in an adult literacy class being offered by student
                                  missionaries, so that one day he could
                                  read the Bible for himself. In the mean-
                                  time he studies the Bible with church
                                  members in his village.
                                      Pray for student and volunteer mis-
                                  sionaries in the Philippines as they
                                  seek to lead others out of spiritual
                                  darkness to the Light of the world.

   Love: The Universal Gift




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Corinthians 13; Gal. 5:22,
23; 2 Peter 1:3-11.

  MEMORY TEXT: "And now abide faith, hope, love, these
  three; but the greatest of these is love" (1 Corinthians 13:13,
  NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Spiritual gifts are tools provided by the Holy
Spirit to do the work of the kingdom. But they are effective only within
the framework of a united church in which love is manifested.

   THE FRAMEWORK OF LOVE. A church member who was not
reelected to church office, even though he had done a good job, had
the locks on the doors to the church changed and refused to unlock
them until he was reelected. In office, this brother apparently used his
spiritual gifts effectively. But something was lacking.
   Paul discusses spiritual gifts in the context of the right kind of
Christian personality and attitude. "Follow the way of love," he writes,
"and eagerly desire spiritual gifts" (1 Cor. 14:1, NIV).
   Spiritual gifts are given for two purposes: to do the work of the
church and to do it within a framework of unity. Love is a power that is
essential to unity.
   Love produces individual and corporate Christian personalities. Its
overall characteristics are outlined in 1 Corinthians 13, Galatians 5:22,
23, and 2 Peter 1:3-11. When you enter a church you can tell whether
love exists. When love is present, spiritual gifts become effective tools
for managing the church and propelling its outreach.

WHAT IS LOVE ALL ABOUT? (1 Corinthians 13).

   Love may be one of the most misunderstood and misused words in
any language. It is supposed to be a universal language, but it has so
many meanings that people may be confused by it. You may say you
love to eat, love to go on picnics, love your dog, and in the same breath
say you love your husband or wife. Is loving God the same as loving to
go on a picnic? How about loving the people in your church? On the
other hand, in spite of all this abstractness, when love happens, you
know it.
   The kind of love we are talking about in this lesson, called agape in
Greek, originates in the character of God Himself (1 John 4:8). It is the
epitome of Christian character (1 John 4:16) and the highest attain-
ment of the Christian lifestyle (1 Cor. 13:13).

   How does Paul emphasize the importance of love in the Chris-
tian church setting? 1 Cor. 13:1-3. What does John say about the
importance of love? 1 John 3:11-24.


   "Pure, sanctified love, expressed by Christ's lifework, is as sacred
perfume. Like an opened bottle of perfume, it fills the whole house
with fragrance. Eloquence, an extended knowledge of the truth, out-
ward devotion, rare talents, if mingled with sacred, humble love, will
become as fragrant as the opened box of ointment. But gifts alone,
ability alone, the choicest endowments alone, cannot take the place of
love. . . . [1 Cor. 13:1-3 quoted]."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1137.

 List the characteristics of love outlined in 1 Corinthians 13.
What makes love a superior gift?


   "[1 Cor. 13:4, 5 quoted.] Troubles exist between brethren in the
church because they fail to understand what constitutes true Christian
charity, brotherly affection, and Christlike love. Self-love and self-
esteem lead professed Christians to measure themselves by them-
selves. They take for granted that all their surmisings and suspicions of
others are correct. But it is because of suspicions and judging of one
another that there is discord, strife, and an unhealthy condition of the
church."—Ellen G. White, Manuscript Releases, vol. 11, p. 261.

    Consider the quotation above. This experience is more com-
 mon than we would like to admit. What is the problem? How can
 this kind of situation be remedied?

                                                                      39

THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT (Gal. 5:22, 23).

   Acceptance of the call to discipleship initiates the development of a
Christian personality. One of the key Scripture passages outlining the
elements involved in this kind of personality is Paul's list of the
Spirit's fruit in Galatians 5:22, 23. Galatians 5 discusses the meaning
of freedom in Christ as opposed to the oppression engendered by
legalism. To ensure that there is no misunderstanding, Paul builds his
case on a framework of love: "You, my brothers, were called to be
free. But do not use your freedom to indulge the sinful nature; rather,
serve one another in love. The entire law is summed up in a single
command: 'Love your neighbor as yourself' " (Gal. 5:13, 14, NIV).

  What does Paul say regarding the way Christians should live
once they have left the old life of sin? Gal. 5:16, 17.


   "The Christian's life is not a modification or improvement of the
old, but a transformation of nature. There is a death to self and sin, and
a new life altogether. This change can be brought about only by the
effectual working of the Holy Spirit."—The Desire of Ages, p. 172.

  Fill in the chart below based on Galatians 5:22, 23, NIV. Try to
develop a practical situation in which each of these characteristics
might be evident.

    Notice that the singular word fruit is used in Galatians 5:22. The

life all the time.

PETER'S LADDER (2 Peter 1:3-11).

   Peter presents another set of criteria for developing and measuring
a Christian personality. Most of his criteria match Paul's list in Galatians
5. But because Peter builds his list around the words "add to," it is
sometimes called "Peter's ladder."

   Fill in the following chart. Look for similarities and differences
in the two lists.

   According to Peter, what will be the effect of developing these
traits of character? 2 Peter 1:8. What happens if one does not
develop them? 2 Peter 1:9.


   There is a connection here with spiritual gifts. Peter points out that
developing these traits of character makes one's ministry effective and
productive. That is achieved by using our spiritual gifts (1 Peter 4:10).

   What does it mean to make one's "calling and election sure"?
2 Peter 1:10.


   "If we are Christ's, our title to the heavenly inheritance is without a
flaw, and in harmony with the provisions of the covenant of grace.
Through grace we shall be able to make our calling and election sure,
putting on the excellency of Christ in spirit and character."—Ellen G.
White, The Messenger, May 10, 1893.

    Take a moment to ask yourself about your own calling and
 election.

                                                                         41
Wednesday                                            January 29
THE RIGHT ATTITUDE (Rom. 12:1-5).

   Attitude counts a great deal in the work of the church. Each indi-
vidual member of a group has his or her own personality, attitudes, and
agenda. We are not in heaven yet, and the pull of the societies and
cultures in which we live is strong. The pull of innate selfishness is
even stronger. The golden rule (Luke 6:31) does not shine as brightly
as it should.
   Yet the life of the church is built around ethical standards based as
much on attitude as on actual overt actions. Finding ways to be unified
while recognizing individual differences in members of the group is
one of the Holy Spirit's purposes in assigning spiritual gifts.

   How did Jesus state the essence of God's law? Matt. 22:37-40.


   "Like the first is the second commandment, 'Thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself.' Mark 12:31. The law of love calls for the
devotion of body, mind, and soul to the service of God and our fellow
men. And this service, while making us a blessing to others, brings the
greatest blessing to ourselves. Unselfishness underlies all true devel-
opment. Through unselfish service we receive the highest culture of
every faculty."—Counsels to Teachers, p. 32.

   How does Paul state the attitudes within which spiritual gifts
function efficiently? Rom. 12:1-5, 9-21. Where did Paul get this
information, and what does it have to do with spiritual gifts?


    In these verses Paul combines his analogy of the human body with
Peter's concept of a "measure of faith." He states that a renewed mind
can override "the pattern of this world" and can understand God's will.
This process, however, demands "sober judgment."
    There is no hierarchy of value attached to spiritual gifts. They are
all of equal importance. Other than the overarching value placed on
love, all other gifts are equally important for the accomplishment of
the work of the kingdom. This perspective places all people on the
same level and focuses them on accomplishing the will of God.

    A church member once remarked, "This church will have the
 right attitude when the day comes that everyone agrees with
 me!" Sound familiar? How would you react to such a remark?
 Why?

Thursday                                           January 30
SPIRITUAL GIFTS AND CHURCH UNITY (1 Corinthians 12;
Eph. 2:11-22; 4:3).

   Unity is a much abused and misunderstood word. To some people,
unity means "everyone agrees with me." To others, it means that
everyone will believe and behave exactly the same way, a perspective
called uniformity. To yet others, it means that even if we don't agree
on everything, we still get along and learn to live with one another as
fellow travelers on the road to heaven. Many evidences of disunity in
the church don't have to do with doctrinal differences; they involve
differences over procedures and personal likes and dislikes. It is pre-
cisely in this realm of procedure, ways of doing things, that spiritual
gifts apply.
    Trace through Paul's concept of "one Spirit" in 1 Corinthians 12.
What pattern emerges? What does he mean by "bond of peace" in
Ephesians 4:3? The Greek word for unity really means "agreement."
    Ellen White puts it this way: "What kind of unity is spoken of in
these words? [John 17:20-23]—Unity in diversity. Our minds do not
all run in the same channel, and we have not all been given the same
work. God has given to every man his work according to his several
ability. There are different kinds of work to be done, and workers of
varied capabilities are needed."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1148.

   Unity also has to do with how various groups of people get
along. What does Paul say on this subject in Ephesians 2:11-22?


   There are all kinds of implications here. In early church times,
many Jews considered non-Jews unworthy of salvation. Greeks be-
lieved they "sprang from the earth," and everyone else on earth was a
"barbarian." People who have common blood lines and cultures often
tend to classify themselves as superior to everyone else.
   On the other hand, God is no respecter of persons, nor does He
show favoritism (Acts 10:34, 35). The Holy Spirit assigns gifts for
service to all born-again believers, regardless of their background,
ethnicity, or former lifestyle (Acts 10:44-46).

    Assume for a minute that there is a debate in your church
 board about how to do a certain thing. Everyone has a different
 idea. What would constitute a unified decision? How would you
 know when one is reached? What is the role of the Holy Spirit in
 producing such a unified decision? What is the role of each

FURTHER STUDY: Read John 17. Go through the chapter and
outline the way Jesus used the concept of unity. This is the prayer in
which Jesus turns over His mission to His disciples and, by extension,
to us. The New International Version translates verse 23: "I in them
and you in me. May they be brought to complete unity to let the world
know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved
me." The Greek word for "unity" here is simply the word for the
numeral 1. Because of the gospel's power, diverse personalities func-
tion together as if they were the numeral 1. The unity is seen in the
common denominators of purpose, dedication, and discipleship. Paul
calls it glorifying God with one heart and mouth (Rom. 15:5, 6).

   The Index to the Writings of Ellen G. White has 46 columns of
references to the word love and seven columns on the word unity. This
should be enough information for all of us to understand the concepts.
The common denominator as she sees it is as follows: "Through the
diversity of the gifts and governments that He [Jesus] has placed in the
church, they will all come to the unity of the faith."—Testimonies to
Ministers, p. 29.

   For some practical examples of how love and unity work in the
church, see Jerry Cook and Stanley C. Baldwin, Love, Acceptance and
Forgiveness (Ventura, Calif.: Regal Books, 1979).

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Is it possible to devise ways of measuring the extent to
     which the fruit of the Spirit is manifest in your church?

   2. Select a number of the "one another" statements in the New
      Testament, and discuss them with your class. To what ex-
      tent are these statements being applied in your church? See
      lesson 13 for more information and a chart of these state-
      ments.

   3. Is the unity of which Jesus, Paul, and Ellen White talk
      really possible? What would it take for your church to
      achieve it?

SUMMARY: Love is the glue that holds together the organizational
system of the church. It is the bond that allows diverse gifts to function
in unity. This kind of Christian love is highly visible to nonchurch
people and is specifically looked for when they become interested in
the church.

                          Jesus in Her Heart, Part 1
                                     Eric Monnier

           Eight-year-old Margarita was eager to attend the Vacation Bible
       School at the local Adventist church. Her friend had invited her and
       told her about the fun she would have singing songs, learning Bible
       verses, and making crafts. Although her parents were not religious,
       they thought it would be good for her to have something special to do
       during vacation, so they gave her permission to attend the program.
           Margarita loved Vacation Bible School, and the teachers loved
       her. Eagerly she learned the songs and memorized the Bible verses.
       And she especially enjoyed making the crafts. Although Margarita
       had never had religious training at home, she absorbed everything
       the teachers presented during the week-long program.
           At the closing program, the pastor spoke to the children and their
       parents about God's love. He invited the people to give their hearts
       to Jesus. Those children who wanted to give their heart to Jesus
       signified their decision by putting a little felt heart on a felt picture of
       Jesus. Solemnly Margarita walked to the front of the church holding
       her felt heart. But instead of placing the heart on the picture of Jesus,
       she carefully lifted the felt figure of Jesus and placed her little heart
       underneath, where Jesus' heart would be.
           After the program Margarita's teacher asked her why she had
       placed her heart under Jesus rather than beside Him. Margarita
       answered simply, "I want to put my heart into the heart of Jesus. I
       want Jesus to live in my heart forever and make me a different girl."
           Margarita told her parents about her decision to follow Jesus. She
       was so excited. Her parents smiled at her decision, but they not think
       too much about it because they did not attend church. But Margarita
        kept talking about it. "Do you know that I will be a different girl
        from now on?" she told them. Margarita told her parents that her
        VBS teacher had invited her to come to Sabbath School, on Satur-
       day, and Margarita's parents said she could come.
           On Sabbath morning Margarita's teacher looked for the girl, but
        no one had seen her. She was not at Sabbath School.

                  Support Gifts




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Gen. 18:1-15; Judges 19:
16-21; Matt. 25:34-40; 2 Corinthians 9.

   MEMORY TEXT: "When he came to Jerusalem, he tried to
   join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing
   that he really was a disciple. But Barnabas took him and brought
   him to the apostles" (Acts 9:26, 27, NIV).

  KEY THOUGHT: The support gifts are the most numerous in the
church and essential for the continual growth of the body of
Christ.

    Special Note: Lessons 6-10 outline specific spiritual gifts. Spir-
 itual gifts are dynamic, designed to be used. The Bible doesn't give
 precise definitions. The definitions are simply guidelines to help you
 understand how specific gifts function.

   MOUNTAIN CLIMBING TAKES TEAMWORK. Mountain-
eers, tied to one another with ropes, depend on teamwork and on
equipment. Without their equipment, mountaineers will never make
any progress or conquer any icy cliffs.
   The Holy Spirit has placed spiritual gifts in the church that are
unspectacular and "quiet." These gifts, the ropes and ties of the church,
are needed to accomplish long-term effective ministry. In most churches,
up to 90 percent of the members have gifts that fall into this category.
   Unfortunately, these gifts are underutilized most of the time. How
can your church better utilize the gifts of its "silent majority."

THE CHURCH AND MINISTRY (Eph. 4:11-13).

   Support gifts are mostly relational. They help build relationships
that cement the church body together as brothers and sisters in the
Lord. Church members, whether new or old, need to be nurtured. For a
church's ministry to be well-rounded, it must include both evangelism
and nurture as integral parts of the entire program.

  How does the apostle Paul envision the exercise of spiritual gifts
by church members? Eph. 4:11-13.


   The support gifts are the underpinnings of what is called the iceberg
principle of church growth. The outstanding characteristic of an ice-
berg is that most of it is under the surface and not visible. The same
goes for the church. The relationships under the surface make visible
programs either successful or unsuccessful. The key words in Ephesians
4:11-13 are "to prepare God's people for works of service" (NIV).
The Greek word translated "preparing" actually means "equipping."
So the ministry of the church must be designed in such a way that it
allows for the equipping and mobilization of the membership in minis-
try.

   It is suggested that churches with an adequate relationship
system will have the following ratios in place:

      Ratio                            Explanation

 New-friends        Each new member should have a minimum of seven
 ratio = 1/7        new friends in the church within the first six months.

 Love/Care          Seven of every ten members should be intentionally
 ratio = 7/10       expressing love for those around them.

 Member-contact     Each church member not involved in a group or task
 ratio = 1/30       should be contacted at least once a month by another
                    member, intentionally showing Christian love and
                    concern.

 Prayer             Each member should have the assurance that someone
 ratio = 1/30       in the church is praying specifically for his or her
                    special needs at least once a month.

  How would you classify the relationship system in your church?
 What can you do to improve it?

                                                                        47

GIFTS OF HELPS AND MERCY (Acts 9:25-27).

   The gifts of helps and mercy are among the most commonly identi-
fied. These are foundational gifts that support the relationship system
of the church congregation.

    Definition: The gift of helps is the special ability that God gives
 to some members of the body of Christ to a greater degree than to
 others to invest the talents they have in the life and ministry of other
 members of the body. The person helped is enabled to increase the
 effectiveness of his or her spiritual gifts.

   People with this gift usually have unselfish natures and like to do
things, even meanial tasks, that help others. They have a willingness to
do little jobs without seeking any credit, just for the joy of doing the
job and knowing they are helping someone. They often take on tasks
that ultimately allow the leadership gifts in the church to be enhanced.
   In the New Testament, Barnabas is a primary example of someone
with this gift. Fill in the chart below that outlines Barnabas' gift in
action.
      Text                           The gift in action
 Acts 9:25-27
Acts 11:24-26
Acts 15:37-39

   Definition: The gift of mercy is the special ability that God
gives to certain members of the body of Christ, more than to others,
to feel genuine empathy and compassion for individuals, both Chris-
tian and non-Christian, who suffer distressing physical, mental, or
emotional problems. Those with this gift translate their compassion
into deeds cheerfully done that reflect Christ's love and alleviate the
suffering.

   Jesus outlined the characteristics of those with this gift (Matt.
25:34-40). Notice that the people addressed in this text didn't even
realize that they had helped so many or that the Lord had taken note of
their actions.

   If no one in your congregation is exercising this gift, does it
 mean there is no need for this ministry? Or is it more likely that
 members have not identified their giftedness and/or the need?
 How could such a situation be remedied?

THE GIFT OF EXHORTATION OR ENCOURAGEMENT
(Acts 4:36).

   This is a person-centered gift, one of the few directly commanded
in the Bible for use by Christians (Heb. 3:13). The KJV reads "Exhort
one another daily"; the NIV uses "Encourage one another daily."

   Definition: The gift of exhortation is the special ability that
 God gives to certain members of the body of Christ to a greater
 degree than to others to minister words of comfort, consolation,
 encouragement, and counsel.

   Outline how Barnabas, besides having the gift of helps, also
exercised the gift of exhortation or encouragement. Acts 4:36;
9:27; 14:23; 15:37-39.


   Barnabas' name means "Son of Encouragement" (Acts 4:36). If it
were not for Barnabas' encouragement, we might be missing almost
half of the New Testament, 13 letters by Paul, and the Gospel of Mark.
People who have this gift exhibit the following characteristics:
   • They frequently advise others about various things.
   • People take their counsel seriously because they feel helped.
   • People like to be around them because their uncomplicated atti-
      tude, demeanor, and down-to-earth counsel cheer them up.
   • People learn from them how to apply Christian principles to
      real-life situations.
   • They enjoy sharing their personal testimony with people be-
      cause God uses it to encourage and help others.

   Do you have the gift of exhortation or encouragement?
 Yes No       Do people often tell you that what you said to them was a real
              help and comfort?
 Yes No       Do you desire to counsel effectively the perplexed,- the guilty,
              or the addicted?
 Yes No       Do you find that you seem to be easy to talk to and people
              engage you in heart-to-heart talks?
 Yes No       Do you find yourself speaking words of encouragement to those
              who are troubled, discouraged, and not sure of themselves?
 Yes No       Do you often correct someone's views with solid scriptural
              counsel and find that people take your counsel?

   Can you relate an experience where the exercise of this gift
 brought you personal blessing?

                                                                          49

THE GIFT OF GIVING (Luke 6:38).

   All Christians are expected to be faithful to the Lord with tithes and
offerings, and to do so cheerfully (2 Cor. 9:7). Some Christians,
however, receive a special gift from the Lord enabling them to give
extraordinary amounts of financial help to the Lord's work.

    Definition: The gift of giving is the special ability that God
 gives to certain members of the body of Christ to a greater degree
 than to others to contribute their material resources to the work of
 the Lord with liberality and cheerfulness.

   Read Luke 6:38. How did Jesus describe God's promise
regarding giving?


   This is a promise from the Lord, but it is also a description of the
attitude of a person with the gift of giving. Ellen White remarks: "Give
what you can now, and as you co-operate with Christ, your hand will
open to impart still more. And God will refill your hand, that the
treasure of truth may be taken to many souls. He will give to you that
you may give to others."—Review and Herald, Dec. 10, 1901. This
happens to people with this gift.

   List some examples in the early church of people with this gift.

      Text                              Example
 Acts 4:34-37
2 Cor. 8:1-5
 Phil. 4:15-18

   How the gift of giving benefits the Lord's work. According to the
New Testament, the financial means returned to the Lord's work by
those who have this gift are used (1) to meet the needs of believers
within the local church itself (Gal. 6:10; 1 John 3:17; 1 Tim. 5:3-5);
(2) to meet the needs of believers in other local churches (2 Cor. 8:1-6;
Rom. 15:25, 26); (3) to meet the needs of those using their gifts of
leadership in full-time ministry for the Lord (Phil. 4:10-19; 1 Cor. 9:1-
14; 1 Tim. 5:17, 18); and (4) to meet the needs of nonbelievers (Gal.
6:10).

    Is the gift of giving necessary only because some people aren't
 faithful with tithes and offerings? Explain your answer.

THE GIFTS OF HOSPITALITY AND SERVICE (1 Peter 4:9).

   Of all the support gifts, these two may be the most pivotal. People
with these gifts know how to make other people feel comfortable,
accepted, and wanted. They are the ones willing to take people home
for a meal and find ways to make them feel part of the family. People
with the gift of hospitality ought to make up the core of greeters or
receptionists you have at the door of your church on Sabbath morning.

    Definition: The gift of hospitality is the special ability that God
 gives to certain members of the body of Christ to a greater degree
 than to others of providing open arms, open homes, and a warm
 welcome for those in need of friendship, acceptance, food, and
 lodging.


   What does the Bible say about hospitality? Fill in the chart.

     Text                          What the Bible says

1 Peter 4:9

 Matt. 25:35

 Heb. 13:2

3 John 5-8

   The Greek word for hospitality, philoxenia, means "expressing love
to a visitor or stranger."

    Definition: The gift of service is the special ability that God
 gives to certain members of the body of Christ to a greater degree
 than to others of identifying unmet needs. The person who has this
 gift makes use of available resources to meet those needs and to help
 accomplish the desired goals.

   The gift of service, or "ministering," is expressed in the KJV by the
word diakonia, a Greek word from which is derived the English word
deacon. This Greek word is used in the New Testament to refer to the
ministration of those who show Christian affection through help and
caring.

    What tasks could be assigned to someone in your congrega-
 tion with the gift of service to facilitate nurture and/or support?

                                                                     51
Friday                                                February 7
FURTHER STUDY: Study James 2:1-7.

    Who Walks in Your Church Door? There are four general catego-
ries of guests who walk in your church door. Each of these groups has
its own set of expectations, fears, hang-ups, and preconceived ideas.
    1. Unchurched people who for one reason or another visit your
       church.
    2. Adventists who attend occasionally.
    3. People brought to church by friends, relatives, and acquaint-
       ances.
    4. Adventists from out of town or from other Adventist churches.
    If you were organizing a greeter or receptionist committee for your
church, how would you use the gifts we have studied in this week's
lesson?
    Additional information on the gift of giving. People with this gift
intuitively recognize the material needs of others. They don't have a
"me first" attitude, but rather a God-given ability to obtain significant
financial resources, a large portion of which is then passed on to the
Lord's work. They also have a conviction that whatever they have
belongs to the Lord. They consider themselves stewards of His goods
and channels for using them for the benefit of others.
    Additional information on the gift of service. The Seventh-day
Adventist Church Manual outlines the office of deacon and deaconess
as being compatible with the gift of service. In practice, unfortunately,
this office is often synonymous with taking care of the church building
and taking up offerings on Sabbath morning.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Analyze the programs in your church to see whether they
     are actually supported by a relationship system. How can
     you improve the situation?

   2. Stand at the church entrance some Sabbath and watch the
      greeter/receptionist system in action. What improvements
      would you make? Why?

SUMMARY: The effective functioning of support gifts is all-
important to the life and ministry of the church. As the most common
gifts, they are the underpinning of the relationship program of the
church congregation. When these gifts are not functioning, the church
becomes deficient in its very lifeblood, and the apostasy rate increases
dramatically.

                          Jesus in Her Heart, Part 2
                                    Eric Monnier

            Although her parents were not religious, they decided to allow
        Margarita to attend the neighborhood Vacation Bible School at the
        Adventist church. She loved the stories and songs about Jesus, and
        the memory verses. At the closing program she gave her heart to
        Jesus, and promised to come to Sabbath School on Sabbath. But
        she did not come.
            The following Monday the minister received a request to visit a
        family whose name he did not recognize. He went to the address
        he was given and knocked at the door. He introduced himself to
        the man who answered the door, and was invited in. The man
        explained, "You do not know us, but our daughter Margarita
        attended your Vacation Bible School. Perhaps you met her."
            Immediately the pastor remembered the little girl who had
        shown such a deep interest in spiritual things during the VBS
        programs. "She is a lovely girl," the pastor said. But he noticed
        that the parents remained solemn. "Is something wrong with
        Margarita?" the pastor asked.
            Margarita's father took a deep breath, then told the pastor, "Our
        daughter was so excited when she told us she had given her heart
        to Jesus. She told us, 'Do you know that I will be a different girl
         from now on?'
            "And she was different. Sometimes Margarita was lazy, as all
        children are, but this past week she was so helpful and happy, we
        couldn't believe the change in her. We decided to celebrate with
        an outing at the beach.
            "We had a good time swimming and playing on the beach. But
        when it was time to go home, Margarita was nowhere around. A
        man said he saw her going toward the water several minutes
         earlier. We ran to the water's edge to look for her, but could not
         find her. The tide was going out. People began searching for her,
         calling for her, but she did not answer. When we found her, it was
         too late. Margarita had drowned."
            The girl's father paused, then he said, "Margarita was so happy
         since she gave her heart to Jesus. Now we want to know her Jesus
         as she knew Him."
            Margarita's parents and older brother began attending Sabbath
         School and church and studied the Bible. In time the entire family
         was baptized, all because a little girl put her heart into the heart of
         Jesus.

                                planned for tomorrow and I don't care.
                           Our family is transferring to the Cloverdale

                 Teaching Gifts




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Deut. 11:18-22; 1 Tim. 4:9-
11; 2 Tim. 2:2; Proverbs 28; 1 Peter 5:1-3.

  MEMORY TEXT: "These things command and teach. Let no
  one despise your youth, but be an example to the believers in
  word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity" (1 Timo-
  thy 4:11, 12, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Teaching gifts are used to instruct people in the
teachings of the Bible, confirm them in the faith and beliefs of the
church, and instruct new believers in the fundamentals of the faith.

   TEACHING IS ONE OF THE KEY FUNCTIONS OF THE
CHURCH. It builds faith and practice in individual lives and in the
corporate life of a church congregation. The Bible tells us that Jesus
spent much of His time teaching. Paul's advice to Timothy is still
relevant today: "Devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to
preaching and to teaching. Do not neglect your gift, which was given
you through a prophetic message when the body of elders laid their
hands on you. Be diligent in these matters; give yourself wholly to
them, so that everyone may see your progress. Watch your life and
doctrine closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save
both yourself and your hearers" (1 Tim. 4:13-16, NIV).
   Related to the gift of teaching are the gifts of knowledge
and wisdom. Often these gifts are integral functions of the gift of
pastoring.

THE TEACHING FUNCTION OF THE CHURCH (Titus 2:1).

  The local church is responsible for ongoing religious education for
church members and new converts.

  What does the Bible say about the teaching ministry of the
church? Deut. 11:18-22; 1 Tim. 4:9-11; 2 Tim. 2:2.

     Text                  Teaching topic, method, or style

 Ezra 7:25

 Psalm 25       Look for the word teach in this psalm.

 Rom. 15:4

1 Tim. 1:3

1 Tim 4:11

 Titus 2:1

 Heb. 5:12


    "There are those who want more definite light than they receive
from hearing the sermons. Some need a longer time than do others to
understand the points presented. If the truth presented could be made a
little plainer, they would see it and take hold of it, and it would be like
a nail fastened in a sure place."—Gospel Workers, p. 407.

 What does the Bible say about Jesus as a teacher? Matt. 22:16;
Mark 10:1; John 6:63.


   "Of the ninety times the Lord was addressed, as recorded in the
Gospels, sixty times He was called 'Rabbi.' Furthermore, the thought
of the speaker in at least part of the thirty remaining cases was directed
toward Jesus as a teacher, for the Greek word didaskalos, which refers to
`one who teaches concerning the things of God, and the duties of man,' is
translated sometimes 'teacher' and sometimes 'master.' "—C. B. Eavey,
Principles of Teaching for Christian Teachers (Grand Rapids, Mich.:
Zondervan; 1940), pp. 24, 25.

   What teaching ministry is your church fulfilling?

THE GIFT OF TEACHING (Acts 19:8-10).

    This gift is vital to the success of the church. Outside the brief
study time allotted to the Sabbath School lesson, teaching is used very
little in many churches. Admonition is utilized far too much, when
teaching ought to be the framework for the church's training program.

    Definition: The gift of teaching is the special ability that God
 gives to some members of the body of Christ more than to others to
 communicate information, attitudes, and skills relevant to the health
 and ministry of the body and its members in such a way that others
 will learn.

   What does the New Testament have to say about teaching? Acts
19:8-10; 1 Tim. 3:1, 2; 4:11-14; 2 Tim. 2:1, 2.


   There are different kinds of teaching. Some teachers are good with
children, others with adults. Some people are good at one-to-one
teaching, while others do better in large-group settings. The point is
that it is the same gift, and the teachers in the church ought to be those
with this gift. All too often, people asked to teach are simply those who
are willing to accept the job, whether they have the gift or not. (See
Friday's lesson.)
   People with this gift have the following characteristics:

   1. The teacher himself or herself will have an intense desire to
      understand truth and excel in the ability to explain it to others.
   2. Others will consistently understand truth as a result of their
      teaching.
   3. People with this gift are not satisfied with unclear or obscure
      meanings.
   4. People grow spiritually as a result of the work of these gifted
      teachers.

   Exercising the gift of teaching is serious business. Because of their
extended sphere of influence, teachers are held highly responsible for
the exercise of their gift. "Not many of you should presume to be
teachers, my brothers, because you know that we who teach will be
judged more strictly" (James 3:1, NIV). "If anyone thinks he is ca-
pable of teaching in the Sabbath school or in the day school the science
of education, he needs first to learn the fear of the Lord, which is the
beginning of wisdom, that he may teach this the highest of all sci-
ences."—Counsels on Sabbath School Work, p. 89.

THE GIFT OF KNOWLEDGE (Matt. 13:11).

   The gift of knowledge concerns the discovery of truth. Some people
have been given the ability to dig deep and accumulate a fund of
knowledge about the Scriptures and the way of salvation that is invalu-
able to the work of the church.

    Definition: The gift of knowledge is the special ability that God
 gives to some members of the body of Christ more than to others of
 discovering, accumulating, analyzing, and clarifying information and
 ideas. that are pertinent to the spiritual growth of the church and the
 well-being of the body.

   What does the Bible say about general religious knowledge all
Christians should have? Matt. 13:11; 2 Cor. 2:14 (compare Eph.
4:13; 1 Tim. 2:4; 2 Peter 3:18).


   Contrast this with the gift of knowledge given to some members of
the church.

      Text                        The gift of knowledge
 Luke 1:1-4
 Acts 18:24, 25
 Rom. 15:14
2 Cor. 11:6

    Paul had this gift. Notice how he explains it in 1 Corinthians 2:6-16.
It is through this gift that Paul was able to reorganize the facts he had
learned previous to his conversion so that they fit the pattern of God-
given wisdom.
    This gift can be easily counterfeited. And Paul says, "knowledge
puffs up" (1 Cor. 8:1, NIV).

   How can those "puffed up" by knowledge create problems?
1 Cor. 8:11; Luke 11:52 (compare Rom. 1:28; 10:2).


    How does a person with this gift receive knowledge? Is the
 gift the ability to study? Do only scholars receive it? Is it
 some kind of "sixth sense" some people have to distinguish truth
 from error? Explain your answer. "Unless our knowledge is a
 stepping-stone to the accomplishment of the highest purposes, it
 is worthless."—Fundamentals of Christian Education, p. 541.

                                                                      59
Wednesday                                           February 12
THE GIFT OF WISDOM (Eccl. 12:11).

   Wisdom is the ability to use knowledge in a practical way. When
the Bible says that "the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom"
(Prov. 9:10), it means that understanding what God reveals about
Himself will lead to practical applications in everyday life.

   Contrast Ecclesiastes 12:11 with Proverbs 9:10. What connec-
tion do you see between the gifts of knowledge and wisdom in these
verses?



    Definition: The gift of wisdom is the special ability that God
 gives to certain members of the body of Christ more than to others to
 know the mind of the Holy Spirit in such a way as to have insight into
 how knowledge may best be applied to specific needs arising in the
 body of Christ.

   "Those who have the gift of wisdom know how to get to the heart of
a problem quickly. They have practical minds and are problem solvers.
They have little difficulty in making decisions because they can fore-
see with a fairly high degree of accuracy what the outcome of the
decisions will be. When those with the gift of wisdom speak, other
members of the Body recognize that truth has been spoken and the
right course of action recommended. Formal learning is not at all a
prerequisite. Long hours of digging out new facts may not appeal at all
to those who have the gift of wisdom."—C. Peter Wagner, Your
Spiritual Gifts Can Help Your Church Grow (Ventura, Calif.: Regal
Books, 1994), pp. 192, 193; revised edition.

   How does the Bible describe the gifts of the men who built the
tabernacle in the wilderness? Exod. 31:1-6.


   Not all wisdom is intellectual. In the case of Bezalel and others, the
gifts were very practical. The gift of knowledge to understand the
intricacies of the artistry necessary to build the tabernacle was com-
bined with the gift of wisdom to know how to make the entire plan
function effectively.

   How would you compare the reliability of counsel from some-
 one who has the gift of wisdom with the reliability of a recom-
 mendation of your church board? What are the implications of
 your response?

THE GIFT OF PASTORING OR SHEPHERDING (1 Peter 5:1-3).

   Our word pastor derives originally from the Greek word poimen,
which means "shepherd." This definition reflects the concept of the
ministry of all believers and assumes a distinction between the office
of pastor and the gift of pastoring.


    Definition: The gift of pastoring or shepherding is the special
 ability that God gives to certain members of the body of Christ to a
 greater degree than to others of assuming a long-term personal
 responsibility for the spiritual welfare of a group of believers.


  The gift of pastoring is a bit more complex than some gifts, because
we tend to see the gift of pastoring and the office of pastor as synony-
mous.

  Study the definition above, and then read 1 Peter 5:1-3. What
do these verses say about the gift of pastoring, or shepherding?


   It is rather startling to realize that your pastor may not have the gift
of pastoring, or shepherding, yet be able to do a fine job in the office of
pastor of your church! It is also rather startling to realize that some
members in your congregation probably do have the gift of pastoring,
and should be assigned the task of looking after the spiritual welfare of
the members, even though they do not fill the office of pastor.
   Ellen White illustrates the point: "The duties of a pastor are often
shamelessly neglected because the minister lacks strength to sacrifice
his personal inclinations for seclusion and study. The pastor should
visit from house to house among his flock, teaching, conversing, and
praying with each family, and looking out for the welfare of
their souls. Those who have manifested a desire to become acquainted
with the principles of our faith should not be neglected, but thoroughly
instructed in the truth."—Gospel Workers, p. 337. Italics supplied.
   The reference is to ministers, apparently with the gift of knowledge,
who, while improving that gift, neglect the duties of the pastoral
office.

    Is there any evidence that church members with the gift of
 shepherding are presently ministering in your congregation? If
 so, in what ways? If not, why?



                                                                       61

FURTHER STUDY: For insight into a concise philosophy of Bible
study and teaching, read "Bible Teaching and Study" in Education,
pp. 185-192.

   Do you have the gift of teaching?

Yes   No   Do you enjoy teaching the Bible and find that people learn
           from your teaching?
Yes   No   Do you enjoy spending considerable time learning Bible truth
           so that you can communicate it to others?
Yes   No   Do you usually organize biblical information in a careful and
           systematic way so that listeners clearly understand it?
Yes   No Have you read the Bible through a number of times?
Yes   No   Given a choice, do you prefer biblical passages that are rich in
           doctrine?

   Do you have the gift of pastoring? The gift of pastoring is almost
always combined with another gift or gifts. For instance, there are
pastor-teachers, pastor-evangelists, and pastor-counselors, just to name
a few gift combinations.

Yes   No Do you enjoy spending time nurturing and caring for others?
Yes   No Have you been instrumental in helping some people return to
            the church?
Yes   No Can you affirm that your Christian example has influenced a
            group of Christians?
Yes   No Are you considered by people in your church to be a spiritual
            leader?
Yes   No Do you tend to provide guidance for the whole person—relationally,
            emotionally, spiritually, and theologically?

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
   1. Could a Christian with the spiritual gift of teaching ever be
      a failure as a Bible class teacher? Why?

   2. What purposes do the spiritual gifts of knowledge and wis-
      dom serve?

SUMMARY: Through teaching gifts, most biblical knowledge is trans-
mitted to the body of Christ. The gifts of knowledge and wisdom
accompany the gift of teaching. A person or a team of people with this
combination of gifts is invaluable to the church. The gift of pastoring,
or shepherding, should not be confused with the office of pastor. Many
people in a congregation may have the pastoral gift.

                                 Sahara de Almerida

            The highlands that lie along the borders of Venezuela, Guyana,
         and Brazil are called la Gran Sabana ("the Great Savannah"). Its
         mountains, colorful prairies, and famous Angel Falls--the highest
         waterfall in the world--draw tourists from all over the world. In the
         midst of this natural beauty towers Mount Roraima, a name famil-
         iar to many Adventists, not because of its beauty, but because of
         what happened there.
            Many years ago an Indian chief named Auka (or Awaka) had a
         vision in which an angel taught him the laws of health and prin-
         ciples of living. The angel told the chief to watch for a "white man
         with a black book." Chief Auka taught his people what the angel
         had told him. Together Chief Auka and his people waited for the
         promised white man with the black book.
             In 1910 Adventist Missionary 0. E. Davis, stationed in Guyana,
         was impressed to travel into the interior and teach the people about
         Christ. After months of grueling travel, he arrived at the village of
         Paraitepuy, on the border of Guyana and Venezuela.
             When the Indians saw Davis, they cried out, "The white man
         with the black book!" Pastor Davis was surprised by this unex-
         pected welcome, and immediately began teaching the people about
         Christ. His work was cut short when he died of malaria, but his
         mission lived on. The villagers buried their beloved teacher at the
         foot of Mount Roraima, and continued to live according to the
         principles he had taught them, and singing the songs they had
         learned.
             When missionaries arrived in this area years later, they found
         villagers who worshiped on the Sabbath, kept no pigs, and sang
          familiar songs! The people wanted to be known as the Davis
          Indians, to honor the man who had taught them about Jesus.
             The work in this area has continued to thrive over the years. On
          Sabbath 3,000 Davis Indian Adventists gather in 12 churches and
          20 groups to worship. Nearly half of these members are under age
          16. With missionary zeal they take the three angels' messages
          from town to town, and from house to house in their different
          dialects and in Spanish and English, as well.
             The Davis Indians have not forgotten their heritage. They love
          the Lord and are eager to go home to heaven, where they can show
          Pastor Davis the fruits of his labors.

          Venezuela Mission.

           Leadership and
         Administrative Gifts




Sabbath Afternoon
                     Gniiir
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 20:20-28; Phil. 2:4-
11; Rom. 12:1-3; Acts 6:1-7.

   MEMORY TEXT: "Whoever desires to be first among you, let
   him be your slave—just as the Son of Man did not come to be
   served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many"
   (Matthew 20:27, 28, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Leadership or administrative gifts deal with the
management and supervision of the church. A person with such gifts
will be in the forefront of church administration.

   WHAT IS A LEADER? From a biblical perspective, a leader is a
person with a God-given capacity and responsibility to influence a
specific group of God's people so that group can fulfill God's pur-
poses for them. There are four significant points in this definition:
(1) The leader is gifted, either through natural talents or special gifts
given by the Holy Spirit. Because of that giftedness, the leader can
influence the group in a significant manner. (2) Leaders must feel a
God-given sense of responsibility. They must feel accountable for
those whom they influence. (3) Leadership is directed toward a par-
ticular group or a particular task. (4) The leader must be convinced of
what the Lord's will is for the group.
   "The people will know intuitively whether or not the . . . [leader]
loves them. It is a feeling produced by the Holy Spirit Himself within
the church."—C. Peter Wagner, Leading Your Church to Growth
(Ventura, Calif.: Regal Books, 1984), p. 115.

SERVANT-LEADERSHIP (Matt. 20:20-28).

   The Bible advocates a leadership philosophy called "servant-
leadership." Servant-leadership produces in people a feeling of respect
and love for leaders because they are doing God's will and obviously
have the best interests of their followers at heart.

  How did Jesus explain servant-leadership to His disciples? Matt.
20:20-28?


   First, the mother of John and Peter asks Jesus for leadership posi-
tions for her sons. Jesus immediately asks whether they are willing to
take responsibility for these positions. Though they say Yes, Jesus lets
them know that they have no real idea what they are asking for or what
the future holds. Then He makes the statement, "Whosoever will be
chief among you, let him be your servant" (Matt. 20:27). This is the
core concept of servant-leadership.

   Read Romans 12:1-3. What is the "measure of faith" spoken of
in verse 3? What does Paul mean by the words, "Think of yourself
with sober judgment" (Rom. 12:3, NIV)?


   The key Greek word for "servant" is doulos, which also means
"slave." A true Christian leader is a voluntary "slave" to Jesus and to
those whom he or she wishes to serve. (See Rom. 1:1; 1 Cor 9:19.)
This perspective on leadership produces an attitude of servanthood on
the part of the leader. The key concepts of servant leadership are:

     Text                               Principle
 John 13:35     "All men will know that you are my disciples if you love
                one another" (NIV).
 Mark 9:33-35   It is serving, not commanding.
 Rom. 12:3      It is being respectful, not looking down on others.
1 Peter 5:3    It is being exemplary, not domineering.
 Rom. 12:10     It is being equal, not superior.
 Eph. 5:21      It is being submissive, not coercive.


    Think about some leaders you have known and your own
 leadership efforts. How do they and you match the principles
 presented in this lesson?

                                                                      65
Monday                                             February 17
THE GIFT OF LEADERSHIP (1 Tim. 5:17).

  The gift of leadership is one of the tools the Holy Spirit uses to
advance the kingdom and inspire people to do great things for the
Lord.

   Definition: The gift of leadership is the special ability that God
gives to certain members of the body of Christ more than to others to
set goals in accordance with God's purposes for the future and to
communicate these goals to others in such a way that they voluntar-
ily and harmoniously work together for the glory of God.

  Fill in the following chart, and study the Bible verses that
pertain to the gift of leadership.

      Text                       Principle of Leadership
1 Tim. 5:17
 Acts 7:10
 Acts 15:13-21
 Rom. 12:8
 Heb. 13:17
 Luke 9:1

   Those with the gift of leadership are to make plans and set goals for
the advancement of the kingdom.

  Do you have the gift of leadership? Answering the following
questions will give you a general idea:

Yes   No     Do people seem to listen and agree when you speak with them?
Yes   No     Do people tend to believe in you and follow your leadership?
Yes   No     Do people accept the goals you suggest?
Yes   No     Do you often end up as the leader of groups you join?
Yes   No     Do things go smoothly when you are in charge?

  Read Romans 12:3 again. Why is Paul so insistent on this
point? See 3 John 9, 10.


   Some people seek leadership positions because they want to
be in charge, and some people refuse to accept leadership posi-
tions because they want to be humble saints. Are either of these
reasons valid? If not, why not?

Tuesday                                            February 18
THE GIFT OF APOSTLESHIP (Acts 9:15, 16).

   The Greek word apostle means "someone who is sent." Apostleship
was a special designation for the original 12 followers called by Jesus,
plus Paul, who was also directly called to be an apostle (Acts 9:15,
16).
   Study of Paul's ministry gives us further insights on apostleship. He
claimed the same authority of the "super-apostles" (2 Cor. 12:11,
NIV), based on divine revelation (2 Cor. 12:1; 1 Cor 9:1) and "signs,
wonders and miracles" (2 Cor. 12:12, NIV). Paul also went into
unentered territory and started new churches. He claimed spiritual
authority because he was the founder of those churches. (See 2 Cor.
11:16-28.) He was, nevertheless, very careful how he used his author-
ity. (See 1 Cor. 9:12; 2 Cor. 10:13-16.)
   The gift of apostleship in the contemporary church is probably best
defined in terms of frontline pioneers who go into new areas, plant
churches, and care for regional groups of churches when they are
initially organized. In this sense, the gift is related to the gift of
missionary.

   Study the following passages and analyze Paul's position on the
gift of apostleship. What was his attitude? How did he use this
gift? How did he not use this gift?
       Text                             Comments
1 Corinthians 9
2 Corinthians 10
   Those with this gift often exhibit:
   1. a strong sense of God's call to establish new work.
   2. a forceful personality that trusts God to do what is necessary to
      establish the authority of His work.
   3. multiple gifts.
   4. a sense of what God wants to do and the courage to cooperate
      with Him.

    "The conversion of sinners and their sanctification through the truth
is the strongest proof a minister can have that God has called him to
the ministry. The evidence of his apostleship is written upon the hearts
of those converted, and is witnessed to by their renewed lives. Christ is
formed within, the hope of glory. A minister is greatly strengthened by
these seals of his ministry.
    "Today the ministers of Christ should have the same witness as that

THE GIFT OF ADMINISTRATION (1 Cor. 12:28).

   The King James Version calls this the gift of governments, but that
sounds more like the gift of leadership we have already studied. The
Greek word used for the gift of administration is different from the one
used for leadership. People with the gift of administration are planners
and goal-setters. They are the ones who can organize a program or
project and make it work.

    Definition: The gift of administration is the special ability that
 God gives to certain members of the body of Christ to understand
 clearly immediate and long-range goals and to devise and execute
 effective plans for the accomplishment of those goals.

   The Greek word translated "administration," kubernesis (1 Cor.
12:28), is actually the term for a ship's captain, the one who guides the
ship to its destination. Today, the same word is applied to airline pilots
in Greece.

   What happened when a ship's captain made a wrong adminis-
trative decision? Acts 27:11, 15, 41.

   Note examples of the gift of administration in action:

       Text                      How was the gift used?
 Acts 6:1-7
 Luke 14:28-30
 Titus 1:5

  Do you have the gift of administration? Answer the following
questions that will help you decide whether you have this gift:
Yes   No Do people recognize your ability to organize ideas, people, and
            activities?
Yes   No Is it easy for you to make plans and set goals and organize ways
            and means of accomplishing them?
Yes   No Do you tend to organize unorganized activities almost automati-
            cally?
Yes   No Are you usually able to get people to do things without a lot of
            persuasion or pressure?
Yes   No Do you enjoy being assigned a task and then carrying it out in an
            organized way?

    Can you share an experience where this gift has been a spe-
 cific blessing to the church to which you belong.

THE GIFT OF FAITH (1 Cor. 12:9).

   All Christians are admonished to have faith in God (Mark 11:22).
We are also told that we are saved through faith that is in itself a gift
from God (Eph. 2:5, 8, 9). Beyond this, however, there is another kind
of faith that is a direct gift of God to certain Christians.

    Definition: The gift of faith is the special ability that God gives
 to certain members of the body of Christ to a greater degree than
 others to discern and accept with extraordinary confidence the will
 and purposes of God for His work.

   This kind of faith looks to the future rather than to the past. People
with this gift can see what God will do, even when the task seems
impossible to accomplish. They are the inventors and promoters of
plans, programs, and projects that would never become reality if this
gift were not present.

  How did Abraham exemplify this kind of faith? Rom. 4:18-21;
Heb. 11:8-10.


   Some characteristics of people who have this gift are:

   1. An unusual desire to accept God's promises at face value and
      claim them until God fulfills them, just as He says He will.

   2. The recurring experience of sensing that God is going to do
      something unusual, even though most around you do not have
      this kind of assurance.

   3. An attitude of expectation that in various crises God will act.

   Study the following statement. How does it reflect the function
of the gift of faith?


   "The success attending Nehemiah's efforts shows what prayer, faith,
and wise, energetic action will accomplish. Living faith will prompt to
energetic action. The spirit manifested by the leader will be, to a great
extent, reflected by the people. If the leaders professing to believe the
solemn, important truths that are to test the world at this time, manifest
no ardent zeal to prepare a people to stand in the day of God, we must
expect the church to be careless, indolent, and pleasure-loving."
—Christian Service, p. 177. (Italics supplied.)

                                                                        69
Friday                                              February 21
FURTHER STUDY: For more information on leadership styles and
administrative and organizational plans, look up the following texts:
Exod. 18:13-27; Ezra 10:16, 17; Neh. 13:23-25. Notice that Ezra took
three months to make a decision because the circumstances called for
careful analysis. Nehemiah, on the other hand, took direct action (to
say the least).

   For additional information on the gift of faith, read Hebrews 11,
and identify the people listed there who had the gift of faith.
   See also Steps to Christ, "Faith and Acceptance," pp. 49-55. This
chapter outlines a faith that all Christians should have. But notice that
those with the specific gift of faith have this attitude, plus an extra
measure of ability to put it into action. See also chapter 1 of the book
Education, "Source and Aim of True Education," for an outline of the
dynamics of human development as envisioned by the Lord.

   Ellen White on servant-leadership: "The thoughts must be trained.
Gird up the loins of the mind that it shall work in the right direction
and after the order of well-formed plans; then every step is one in
advance, and no effort or time is lost in following vague ideas and
random plans. We must consider the aim and object of life, and ever
keep worthy purposes in view. Every day the thoughts should be
trained and kept to the point as the compass to the pole. Everyone
should have his aims and purposes, and then make every thought and
action of that character to accomplish that which he purposes. The
thoughts must be controlled. There must be a fixedness of purpose to
carry out that which you shall undertake."—Mind, Character, and
Personality, vol. 2, p. 656.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Think of someone you know who has the gift of administra-
     tion. How does this gift aid the church family? What would
     your group be without this person? Give some specific ex-
     amples.

   2. What is the difference between the faith that all believers
      have and the gift of faith? Describe a situation in which you
      have seen this gift in action.

SUMMARY: Servant-leadership is a gift designed by God and exem-
plified in the Bible. The gifts of leadership, administration, and faith
make servant-leadership effective. These are the gifts that, in many
ways, are the engine that drives the machinery of the church as she
seeks to take the message of the kingdom to the world.

                       Miracle in Glasov
                           James Zachary

   "What are those Americans doing to you?" the middle-aged Rus-
sian man asked his wife as she returned from an evangelistic meeting
in Glasov, Russia. "What drug are they giving you? You have changed
so much I hardly recognize you!" The man was suspicious of the
dramatic change in his wife's countenance.
   For several years the man's wife, Kima, had been a manager in a
factory and a loyal member of the Communist party, with all of its
privileges. Her high salary provided many comforts her countrymen
could only dream of.
   But the fall of Communism brought an abrupt end to Kima's
privileged lifestyle. She lost her job and could not find another. She
became depressed and lost all hope for the future. She turned to
alcohol and tobacco to ease her pain. Each day she seemed to sink
lower into a pit of despondency. She began to consider suicide.
   Then a young woman invited her to attend some meetings called
the "New Way of Life." Kima was an atheist; she had no time for
American Christianity, and the Bible had no place in her plans. But
what else was there? She doubted it would help, but finally she
agreed to go just to see. God had other plans for her.
   "At the meetings I was amazed. The people were so friendly,"
Kima testified. "I listened to their prayers, and the Bible touched my
heart." Kima purchased some books following the meeting. As she
read one book about Jesus, she checked every reference in the Bible
she had received. "I felt strangely warmed as I read. I could not put
the books down. I spent eight hours in study."
   Now Kima is a new person. "I love the Bible. I think I have been
born all over to a new life," she says. "If these meetings had been
delayed one week, I would have been dead. I had lost all interest in
living any longer. I had made plans to end my life. Thank you for
coming to Glasov."
    Kima is attending one of four house churches in Glasov, and is
                       preparing for baptism. She has requested mate-
                       rials so she can help her friends conquer alco-
                       holism. "I no longer yearn for a high position
                       and a large salary. I would be happy to be a
                       street sweeper, as long as I can know Jesus and
                       have His joy in my heart."

                        Kima (left) found a new life. James Zachary is
                     global evangelism coordinator for the Quiet Hour.

                 Outreach Gifts




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S LESSON: Matt 28:16-20; 24:14; Acts
1:8; 8:1-40.

   MEMORY TEXT: "But you shall receive power when the Holy
   Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in
   Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the
   earth" (Acts 1:8, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Outreach is the primary job of the church. The
gifts that fall into this category are those that facilitate winning souls.

   THE WORD EVANGELISM comes from the Greek word
euaggelizein, which is a combination of two words, eu, meaning
"good," and aggellein, meaning "to carry news," or "to proclaim
something." The word gospel, a direct derivative of these Greek words,
means "the good news." "Good news" is used 132 times in the New
Testament.
   Some form of the word euaggelizein, meaning "to evangelize," is
used 55 times in the New Testament, mostly by Luke and Paul. Luke
uses it as a synonym for the proclamation of the good news, and Paul
uses it to explain the mission of Jesus.
   The word for an evangelist, euaggelistes, means "a preacher of
good news"; it occurs only three times. In the three instances of its use,
Philip (Acts 21:8) and Timothy (2 Tim. 4:5) are called euaggelistes,
and it is mentioned as a specific spiritual gift in Ephesians 4:11.
   The outreach gifts of the Spirit empower evangelism.

EVANGELISM: THE LIFEBLOOD OF THE CHURCH (Matt. 28:
18-20).

    "The very life of the church depends upon her faithfulness in
fulfilling the Lord's commission."—The Desire of Ages, p. 825.

  Look up the four versions of the great commission in your
Bible. What do these versions communicate to you? Matt. 28:18-
20; Mark 16:14-20; Luke 24:44-49; John 20:19-23.


   Evangelism is a term that takes in the entire procedure of presenting
the good news to nonbelievers and integrating them into the church.
Evangelism is an application of the great commission.

  Read again Matthew 24:14, 28:16-20, and Acts 1:8. How is the
subject of these verses related to evangelism?


   "The church is God's appointed agency for the salvation of men. It
was organized for service, and its mission is to carry the gospel to the
world."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 9.
   To evangelize is to (1) receive the Holy Spirit; (2) go into all the
world; (3) witness about Jesus; (4) proclaim the good news; (5) make
disciples; (6) baptize new converts; (7) train people to win converts.
   It is suggested that churches with an adequate evangelism program
will have the following ratios in place:


            Ratio                           Explanation

 Nonmember-guests-in-the- At least 5 of every 100 persons attend-
 congregation ratio = 5/100 ing on Sabbath morning should be guests
                            from the church's ministry area.

 Members'-soul-winning- One of every 2 active members should
 network ratio = 1/2    identify their network of nonmember
                        friends, relatives, work associates.

 First-time-visitor-retention One of 4 first-time visitors from the
 ratio = 1/4                  church's ministry area should become
                              active members within a year.
 Second/third-time-visitor Three of 4 second-, third-, and fourth-
 ratio = 3/4                  time visitors should be active within a
                              year.

                                                                     73

GIFTS OF TONGUES AND INTERPRETATION OF TONGUES
(Mark 16:17).

   These are two of the most controversial gifts, mostly because of the
way they are used in Pentecostal circles and the Charismatic move-
ment. They are considered outreach gifts in this series of lessons,
based on Paul's statement in 1 Corinthians 14:22: "Tongues, then, are
a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers" (NIV).

   Fill in the following chart on the gift of tongues:

         Text                 What does it say about tongues?
 Mark 16:17
 Acts 2:4-11
 Acts 10:46
1 Cor. 12:10, 28
1 Corinthians 14
1 Cor. 12:10; 14:5, 39
   No one knows exactly what situation Paul was facing in 1 Corinthians
14. In general, the Seventh-day Adventist Church has assumed that the
gift of tongues refers to the ability to learn and use a language or
languages not one's own, often in a miraculous way as on the Day of
Pentecost. Most illustrations of speaking in tongues in Adventist mis-
sion literature underline this belief.
   Ellen White makes it clear that this is the meaning in Acts 2: "[The
Holy Spirit] was an emblem of the gift then bestowed on the disciples,
which enabled them to speak with fluency languages with which they
had heretofore been unacquainted. The appearance of fire signified the
fervent zeal with which the apostles would labor and the power that
would attend their work."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 39.
   On the other hand: "Fanaticism, false excitement, false talking in
tongues, and noisy exercises have been considered gifts which God
has placed in the church. Some have been deceived here."—Last Day
Events, p. 159.
   Reversing the Tower of Babel. At the Tower of Babel, God
confused people's language so that sin would be confined to small
pockets of people. At Pentecost, He reversed the process and caused
large numbers of people to hear the gospel. That is why tongues can be
classified as an outreach gift.
   The gift of interpretation of tongues is more than translation from
one language to another. In many ways, it is the functional equivalent
of the gift of prophecy. It is the ability to pass on a divinely inspired
message in the vernacular so that people can understand.

THE GIFT OF EVANGELISM (2 Tim. 4:5).

   The gift of evangelism is unique. People with this gift can lead
people to decisions for the faith in ways that are almost impossible for
others. The Lord gives them words to speak and places them in situa-
tions where they find receptive people.

    Definition: The gift of evangelism is the special ability that God
 gives to some members of the body of Christ to a greater degree than
 to others of sharing the gospel with unbelievers in such a way that
 men and women become Jesus' disciples and responsible members
 of the body of Christ.

  Study carefully the following examples of people with the gift of
evangelism. How does this gift work? 2 Tim. 4:5; Acts 8:26-40.


   People with this gift are out on the front lines looking for converts.
They are the people who like to knock on doors, engage people in
conversations on buses and airplanes, visit people in their homes to
give them Bible studies, and ask direct questions about people's will-
ingness to accept the Lord.

  Do all Christians have the special gift of evangelism? 1 Cor.
12:14-20.


   The obvious answer is No. There are two issues involved here.
Worldwide studies show that usually no more than 5-10 percent of a
church's active membership will have the spiritual gift of evangelism.
Why is this the case? First of all, because the gift of evangelism is a
specialized gift. Evangelism in this sense does not mean only public
meetings. It involves many outreach methods like those mentioned
above. Second, not having the gift of evangelism does not mean sitting
back and doing no outreach at all. A basic principle of Christian life is
this: Not all Christians are evangelists, but all Christians are wit-
nesses. All Christians are responsible for witnessing, telling friends,
relatives, and work associates the gospel story and presenting a per-
sonal testimony. But those having the gift develop skills in opening
conversations, encouraging decisions, doing "the work of an evange-
list" (2 Tim. 4:5) with finesse and dexterity.

   Do you have the gift of evangelism? Ask yourself whether you
 have the specialized abilities of an evangelist.


                                                                     75

THE GIFT OF DISCERNMENT (1 Cor. 12:10).

   The gift of discernment is classified as an outreach gift because it is
part of the process of telling right from wrong in the presentation of the
gospel. This gift is also called "the ability to distinguish between
spirits" (1 Cor. 12:10, NIV). Others call it the gift of insight.

    Definition: The gift of discerning of spirits is the special ability
 God gives to some members of the body of Christ more than to
 others of knowing with assurance whether certain behaviors or ideas
 purported to be of God are in reality divine, human, or satanic.

   How did Peter use this gift in his ministry?

            Experience                       The gift in action
 Ananias and Sapphira, Acts 5:1-10
 Simon the Sorcerer, Acts 8:14-25

   1 John 4:1 clearly indicates that "spirits" have to be tested. In some
ways, this could be classified as a sign or power gift; the "spirits"
discerned are often satanic.

   How does Hebrews 5:11-14 clarify the use of this gift?


   This is not a common gift. It must be used judiciously and with
courage. Many people who have it are fearful of using it, because the
consequences can be turbulent. In 1 Corinthians 14:29, discussing the
issue of orderliness in worship services, Paul counsels: "Two or three
prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is
said" (NIV). The words "weigh carefully," or "let the other judge"
(KJV), translate the Greek word that means "make a distinction,"
"differentiate," "judge correctly." The exercise of discernment is needed.
   Some characteristics of those who have this gift are (1) a keen
ability to recognize inconsistencies; (2) the tendency to spot what is
wrong with an idea or teaching and to suggest how to fix it; (3) a deep
conviction not easily put to rest when they know people are being
given half-truths, misapplied truths, or false teachings.

    Assume that someone introduces into your church what pur-
 ports to be new or advanced biblical understanding. How might
 your congregation use the gift of discernment in its midst to
 ascertain the validity of the person's teaching?

Thursday                                           February 27
THE GIFT OF MISSIONARY (Rom. 1:5).

  The gift of missionary refers to the ability to work cross-culturally.
Not everyone can do this, nor are all called to do so.

    Definition: The gift of missionary is the special ability that God
 gives to some members of the body of Christ to exercise whatever
 other spiritual gifts they have in a second culture.

   There are different types of evangelism and outreach, usually clas-
sified according to the target group the evangelizers wish to reach.
Their aim may be (1) the internal spiritual and numerical growth of the
existing congregation; (2) bringing new converts from the community
into the existing congregation; (3) planting new churches;
(4) reaching out to different ethnic, language, or cultural groups.
    People with the gift of missionary may work in any of these ways,
though most often they function at point 4. Often they serve outside
their country of origin.

   How did Paul outline his combination of gifts, including the gift
of missionary? Rom. 1:5; 15:16; Gal. 2:7, 8; 1 Tim. 2:7.


   Study carefully Peter's experience with Cornelius in Acts 10
and 11:1-18. Notice his reaction when he arrived at Cornelius'
house (Acts 10:27-29). What did he have to explain to the other
disciples? Did Peter have the gift of missionary? Gal. 2:7-14.


   "This vision conveyed to Peter both reproof and instruction. It
revealed to him the purpose of God—that by the death of Christ the
Gentiles should be made fellow heirs with the Jews to the blessings of
salvation. As yet none of the disciples had preached the gospel to the
Gentiles. In their minds the middle wall of partition, broken down by
the death of Christ, still existed, and their labors had been confined to
the Jews, for they had looked upon the Gentiles as excluded from the
blessings of the gospel. Now the Lord was seeking to teach Peter the
world-wide extent of the divine plan."—The Acts of the Apostles,
p. 135.

    What circumstances have or have not led your congregation
 to take an interest in cross-cultural ministry? How would you go
 about starting this kind of ministry?



                                                                     77
Friday                                             February 28
FURTHER STUDY: For additional information on the church's out-
reach, study Luke 24:45-49. See The Acts of the Apostles, chapters 1-
3, and The Desire of Ages, chapter 86. Two books will help you learn
how to use your gift of evangelism in witnessing for Christ: Mark
Finley, Persuasion: How to Help People Decide for Jesus (Ministerial
Association, General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, 1994)
and Philip G. Samaan, Christ's Way of Reaching People (Hagerstown,
Md.: Review and Herald, 1990). For an interesting record of evange-
lism in the time of the apostles, see Michael Green, Evangelism in the
Early Church (Grand Rapids, Mich.: William B. Eerdmans, 1970).

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Ellen White makes the statement: "Every true disciple is
     born into the kingdom of God as a missionary."—The De-
     sire of Ages, p. 195. How does this statement correlate with
     the gift of missionary?

   2. Does "evangelism" mean only public meetings, or are there
      other methods that those with the gift of evangelism can
      utilize?

   3. In many parts of the world it is common to resort to legal
      action to solve problems. Under what circumstances would
      it be appropriate to have someone with the gift of discern-
      ment attempt to resolve a difference between church mem-
      bers? What might be the dangers in using this procedure?

SUMMARY: Outreach gifts are the lifeblood of the church. No church
can long survive if it is not winning new converts. Soul winning is the
Lord's mandate for the church. Utilizing the outreach gifts in a congre-
gation makes soul winning efficient and productive.

Inaba, Mission
                  Prayers Answered in Mongolia, Part 1
                                 Scott Christiansen

           "Oh, yes, we know ADRA," the important Mongolian govern-
        ment official nodded and frowned. "They bring criminals into our
        country!" My mouth fell open in shock and amazement.
            In 1993 a storm of charges and suspicion broke over ADRA and
        the tiny Adventist congregation in Mongolia. A young man from the
        United States had attended the Adventist church and even volun-
        teered on a church program to help the street children in Ulaanbaatar,
        Mongolia's capital city. Later we learned that the man was wanted
        by police in the United States on a variety of charges; and Mongolia
        was cooperating with the U. S. in arresting him. The event was big
        news in Mongolia, and the story became exaggerated and twisted
        with each retelling. Unfortunately, ADRA and the Adventist believ-
        ers were caught up in the negative publicity.
            Adventist Christians in Mongolia and around the world prayed
        fervently that God would overrule in the crisis, and bring honor to
        His name. And He did.
            The president of Mongolia called a meeting to consider the situa-
        tion of children in Mongolia. I had been invited to the meeting, but
        my name had been dropped from the guest list. Only quick action by
        friends got me into the president's meeting. Throughout the meeting
        I prayed for an opportunity to introduce ADRA and to give an
        accurate description of the good work we were doing.
            As the meeting was coming to a close, the president said, "Be-
        fore we close, are there any comments?" Then, pointing at me, he
        said, "How about you, young man. Stand up and introduce your-
        self."
            After the meeting, in answer to prayer, the tide began to turn.
        When the ADRA team went to the country's only retirement home to
        distribute food, warm blankets, and clothing to the 130 elderly men
        and women there, we found a television news team covering the
        event. They produced a ten-minute report of ADRA that aired imme-
        diately before a speech by the Mongolian president on the occasion
        of the Mongolian New Year, which, in that country, is traditionally
         the time to honor the elderly.
            Our hearts rejoiced that God was working out our public-relations
         problems. But it was a comment made some time later that showed
         us how completely God was answering our prayers.

           Sign or Power Gifts




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Acts 8:9-25; 13:4-12; 14:3;
19:11-20.

   MEMORY TEXT: "It is my pleasure to tell you about the
   miraculous signs and wonders that the Most High God has
   performed for me. How great are his signs, how mighty his
   wonders! His kingdom is an eternal kingdom; his dominion
   endures from generation to generation" (Daniel 4:2, 3, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Sign or power gifts are miracles, direct revela-
tions from God, or actions by believers so startling they call the
attention of nonbelievers to the Christian faith. These gifts are usually
not as common as other gifts. For instance, the Bible names only 50 or
60 prophets. When these gifts appear, there are nearly always dramatic
actions and reactions by the people involved.

    "THE HOLY GHOST REPAIR SERVICE, INC." That was the
title of the tract handed out by a person on the street corner. It claimed
that the Holy Spirit was waiting to "repair" people through astounding
miracles. Our first reaction to such an approach is usually one of
caution. But the Bible recounts that signs and wonders are real.
    We often downplay miracles, signs, and wonders because we are
concerned that they will be confused with their counterfeits. But, our
missionary literature is filled with stories of the miraculous. It seems
we are willing to acknowledge these signs and wonders as long as they
happen at a physical distance. Ask yourself whether and how you can
legitimately experience these signs and wonders.

SIGNS AND WONDERS (Mark 16:15-20).

   In the Bible, signs and wonders fall into three categories. First, the
phrase is applied repeatedly to the miracles witnessed in Egypt at the
time of the Exodus. Second, personal testimonies are related by indi-
viduals who had astonishing experiences with God's power. Third, in
the early church, signs and wonders provided direct testimony to
unbelievers that Christianity is the true religion.
   After the New Testament period, signs and wonders became less
common. Ellen White tells us they will become common again during
the latter rain, though not as prominent as in Christ's day. (See Se-
lected Messages, book 2, chapter 5.)

   What does Mark's version of the great commission say about
signs and wonders in the experience of the disciples? Mark 16:15-
20.


   In the Bible, signs and wonders appear particularly at times of crisis
or when they have some prophetic significance.

  Historical Period                   Signs and Wonders
 Moses and Joshua      The Exodus and the conquest of Canaan
 Elijah and Elisha     Revival and rescue from apostasy
 Jesus and the apostles Most notable period of miracles, signs, and wonders
 Latter rain           Revival of highly visible signs and wonders

   How did Peter connect signs and wonders with the messiahship
of Jesus? Acts 2:22.


   Signs and wonders are evidence to unbelievers, and to doubting
believers, that God is indeed working in a certain circumstance or
occasion. The Lord may choose to use them at any time for that
purpose.
   John Calvin wrote: "Paul calls them signs, because they are not
empty shows, but are appointed for the instruction of mankind; won-
ders, because they ought, by their novelty, to arouse men and strike
them with astonishment; and mighty deeds, because they are more
signal tokens of divine power than what we behold in the ordinary
course of nature."—Quoted in R. V. G. Tasker, The Second Epistle of
Paul to the Corinthians (Grand Rapids, Mich.: William B. Eerdmans,
1958), p. 180.

                                                                        81

THE GIFT OF PROPHECY (1 Thess. 5:19-21).

    Definition: The gift of prophecy is the special ability that God
 gives to certain members of the body of Christ to receive and com-
 municate an immediate message from God to His people through a
 divinely appointed utterance.

    The gift of prophecy figures prominently in the Bible. There are
two general kinds of prophecy, called "classical" and "predictive."
Classical prophecy deals with the contemporary situation. The writ-
ings of Isaiah and Jeremiah are examples. These men received some
messages that were primarily directed to the people of their own time,
and other messages that contained predictive elements. Daniel and
Revelation contain much predictive prophecy.
    The gift of prophecy may function long-term or short-term. As in
the case of Ellen White, a person may receive a lifelong call to
prophetic ministry. On the other hand, the Holy Spirit may choose to
assign the gift of prophecy temporarily, often to resolve a difficult
issue that needs clear intervention by the Lord. Notice two special
people at Jesus' dedication. Simeon, a priest who had long prayed to
live to see the Messiah, was "moved by the Spirit" and gave a short
prophecy about Jesus' life (Luke 2:25-35). Anna, a long-term proph-
etess, gave no prophecy of the future, but she witnessed diligently to
all who would listen (Luke 2:36-38). Simeon, a short-term prophet,
gave a predictive message.

   How do false prophets figure into the prophetic picture? 1 John
4:1; 1 Thess. 5:19-21.


   False prophets bring true prophets into disrepute. Truly spiritually
gifted people often fall victim to people who invent their own so-
called giftedness. On the other hand, we can't be so overly cautious
that we neglect the clear indications of the Bible about the validity of
the gift of prophecy. (Read again 1 Thess. 5:19-21.)
   "The light of prophecy still burns for the guidance of souls, saying,
`This is the way, walk ye in it.' It shines on the pathway of the just to
commend, and on the way of the unjust to lead to repentance and
conversion."—My Life Today, p. 42.

    In a certain church, a member claimed to have prophetic
 visions at 5:00 a.m. every day. She spent most of her time visit-
 ing parishioners and undoing everything the church leadership
 did, based on her supposed gift of prophecy. How would you and
 your church handle a situation like this?

GIFTS OF MIRACLES AND HEALING (1 Cor. 12:9,10).

   In terms of highly visible divine interventions, these are two of the
more spectacular gifts of the Spirit. We are all familiar with the
practice of these gifts in the early Christian church. We are also
familiar with experiences related in missionary literature. How about
ourselves, close to home? When was the last time you and your family
experienced a miracle, such as a divine healing?

    Definition: The gift of miracles is the special ability that God
 gives to certain members of the body of Christ to serve as human
 intermediaries through whom it pleases God to perform powerful
 acts that are perceived by observers to have altered the ordinary
 course of nature.

   Miracles come in all sizes and shapes. Assuming that the miracle is
not a deception, the key principle is that God is the author of all true
miracles. He uses people to perform miracles according to a need He
knows about, not according to our perceptions.

   Definition: The gift of healing is the special ability that God gives
to certain members of the body of Christ to serve as human intermedi-
aries through whom it pleases God to cure illnesses and restore health
apart from the use of natural means.

   There are people with this gift who pray for the sick according to
the instructions in James 5:13-20, and people are healed. Some people
pray for miracles, as did Elijah, and miracles happen. Yet Elijah was
"a man just like us" (James 5:17, NIV). He was spiritually gifted by
God to accomplish a task for the advancement of the kingdom.

  How does Satan again try to counterfeit true gifts, especially
during the loud cry and the latter rain? Rev. 13:13; 16:13, 14.


   "Satan, surrounded by evil angels, and claiming to be God, will
work miracles of all kinds to deceive, if possible, the very elect. God's
people will not find their safety in working miracles, for Satan would
counterfeit any miracle that might be worked. God's tried and tested
people will find their power in the sign spoken of in Exodus 31:12-18.
They are to take their stand on the living Word—'It is written.' This is
the only foundation upon which they can stand securely. Those who
have broken their covenant with God will in that day be without hope
and without God in the world."—Selected Messages, book 2, p. 55.


                                                                     83

GIFTS OF SPIRITUAL WARFARE (Acts 16:16-18).

    Spiritual warfare is a modern phrase for an old battle. Adventists
usually call it the great controversy between Christ and Satan. Often
the battle lines become closely drawn, and the forces of good and evil
are embroiled in tangible battle. A classic example is Elijah's experi-
ence on Mount Carmel. Other examples are Jesus' confrontation with
a legion of demons (Mark 5:1-20) and Paul's confrontation with Elymas
the sorcerer (Acts 13:4-12).

   Definition: The gift of deliverance (or exorcism) is the special
ability that God gives to certain members of the body of Christ more
than to others of casting out demons and evil spirits.

   This gift is alluded to, but is not directly mentioned in any list in the
New Testament. (See Matt. 12:22-32; Luke 10:17-20; Acts 8:
5-8.)

 How did Paul react to the declarations of a young girl in Philippi?
Why did he react this way? Acts 16:16-18.


  The gift of deliverance or exorcism has been abused and misused in
such spectacular ways that it is often hard to tell the true from the
counterfeit. But in spite of these counterfeits there are times when
Christians are called upon to do open battle with the forces of evil.

   Definition: The gift of intercession is the special ability that God
gives to certain members of the body of Christ to pray for extended
periods of time on a regular basis and see frequent answers to their
prayers, to a degree much greater than that which is expected of the
average Christian.

   This gift is also alluded to, though not directly mentioned, in the
New Testament. (See James 5:14-16; 1 Tim. 2:1, 2; Col. 4:12, 13.)
Prayer for others results in answers that although not always recog-
nizable, are nonetheless dramatic and effective.

    Have you ever been involved in a situation in which these gifts
 were utilized? Have you ever been involved in a situation in
 which special things happened, but you weren't too sure about
 their validity? How can you be prepared to tell the true from the
 false if ever you should find yourself in such a situation?

GIFTS OF MARTYRDOM, VOLUNTARY POVERTY, AND
CELIBACY (1 Cor. 13:3).

   These three gifts are included with the power or sign gifts because
they are readily apparent and highly visible. They are definite signs to
nonbelievers that a Christian presence is in their midst.

   What do the following verses say about each of these gifts?

    Text and Gift                         Description
 Martyrdom
1 Cor. 13:3; Acts 7:60
 Voluntary Poverty
1 Cor. 13:3
 Celibacy
1 Cor. 7:7; Matt. 19:12



    Definition: The gift of martyrdom is the special ability that God
 gives to some members of the body of Christ to undergo suffering
 for the faith, even to death, while consistently displaying a joyous
 and victorious attitude that brings glory to God.
    Definition: The gift of voluntary poverty is the special ability
 that God gives to some members of the body of Christ to renounce
 material comfort and luxury and adopt a personal lifestyle equiva-
 lent to those living at the poverty level in a given society in order to
 serve God more effectively.

   Ellen White remarks about Nicodemus: "[Nicodemus] used his
wealth in helping to sustain the church at Jerusalem and in advancing
the work of the gospel. . . . He became poor in this world's goods; yet
he faltered not in the defense of his faith."—The Acts of the Apostles,
p. 105.

    Definition: The gift of celibacy is the special ability that God
 gives to some members of the body of Christ to remain single and
 enjoy it; to be unmarried and not suffer undue sexual temptations.

  Paul was himself an example of this gift. Being unmarried is not
necessarily the same as having this gift. Those who have this gift
remain single because they feel they can serve the Lord better that
way.


                                                                      85
Friday                                                     March 7
FURTHER STUDY: For more information on devil possession and
the gift of exorcism, read in context Matthew 8:32; 9:33; 15:28; 17:18;
Acts 5:16. See, also, the SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, pp. 575-578,
and The Great Controversy, chapter 31. There have been outbreaks of
so-called "deliverance ministries" in the Adventist Church that have
gone far beyond the bounds of biblical guidelines. For more informa-
tion, you can obtain a number of documents from the General Confer-
ence Biblical Research Institute on this subject.

  For further information on modern-day martyrs, see James and
Marti Hefley, By Their Blood: Christian Martyrs of the 20th Century
(Milford, Mich.: Mott Media, 1979).

   A word of warning: The kinds of confrontation with the forces of
evil experienced through signs and wonders are not for everyone.
Satan is no one to fool with. Ellen White, writing to Moses Hull, an
early Adventist evangelist who later became a spiritist, remarks: "You
have parleyed with Satan, and reasoned with him, and tarried upon
forbidden ground, and have exercised your mind in things which were
too great for you, and by indulging in doubts and unbelief have at-
tracted evil angels around you, and driven from you the pure and holy
angels of God. . . . You went to battle with Satan and his host without
an armor, and have been grievously wounded, and are insensible to
your wound."— Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1, pp. 428, 429.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Why do you suppose we hear more about signs, wonders,
     and miracles in nontechnological societies?

   2. Does God intend Christians to exercise such gifts in areas
      where there is ready access to advanced medical knowl-
      edge?

SUMMARY: Sign or power gifts are those that demonstrate the
power of God in highly visible, often spectacular ways. The gift of
prophecy is also included in this category. These gifts are still as valid
as any other gift, but they are less common. The Lord usually uses
them to solve extraordinary problems.

        EIF        Prayers Answered in Mongolia, Part 2
                                  Scott Christiansen

              Some bad press had hampered ADRA's work in Mongolia,
          and cast doubt upon the church, as well. Then some unexpected
          television news coverage of ADRA assisting the elderly in the
          retirement home helped repair the image of the church and
          ADRA in Mongolia.
              Meanwhile, ADRA was busy working on several other projects:
          supplying nutrition supplement bars to children and nursing mothers,
          providing desperately needed supplies to a region in which the
          only hospital had collapsed into a pile of bricks and twisted
          metal, and caring for nomadic mothers who had no clinic in
          which to give birth. Garden projects were introduced to help poor
          women provide for their families; and a low-cost, highly insu-
          lated housing design was introduced to the country. Several of
          these projects received media attention. But the government still
          had doubts about ADRA.
              Then ADRA was asked to help provide desperately needed
          laundry facilities for the country's only infant orphanage. The
          orphanage housed 130 infants and toddlers but had no adequate
          laundry facilities. Most laundry was washed by hand in tepid
          water, then hung over stair railings and steam radiators to dry.
          But the building often was so cold during Mongolia's bitter
          winters that the laundry never fully dried. Babies often were
          dressed in inadequately laundered, damp clothes.
              ADRA surveyed the situation and agreed to provide an institu-
          tional-size washer, water extractor, and dryer large enough to
           meet the needs of the orphanage plus take in laundry from hotels
           that would generate income for other improvements. The facili-
           ties required a new laundry room, and ADRA added new linen to
           the list.
               Top government officials were invited to the inauguration
           ceremony for the new laundry facilities, and as a sign of ADRA's
           acceptance in the country, they all agreed to attend. The wife of
           the U. S. ambassador to Mongolia, who had worked as a volun-
           teer at the orphanage for two years, called the laundry equipment
           a "dream come true." And the wife of the Mongolian president
           accepted ADRA's donation on behalf of the people of Mongolia.
           At the end of her speech she said with a smile, "Oh, yes, we know
           ADRA, and we are happy they are here."

              Scott Christiansen has been the director of ADRA/Mongolia since
           1994.

    How to Discover and
  Verify Your Spiritual Gifts




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 25:14-30; Eph. 4:12-
16; 1 Cor. 12:12-31.

   MEMORY TEXT: "The man who had received the five talents
   brought the other five... . His master replied, 'Well done, good
   and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I
   will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your
   master's happiness!' " (Matthew 25:20, 21, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Those who receive spiritual gifts must learn to
use them efficiently. Spiritual gifts must be developed. They are not
assigned to a person with all the skills already in place.

   SPIRITUAL GIFTS MUST BE POLISHED AND PERFECTED.
While going to college, a young man worked in a factory that produced
bushings for all kinds of machinery. One of the operations called for
grinding and polishing the bushings by hand. Bushings of this type are
small. One slip, and you grind your finger instead of the bushing. The
young man walked around with bandaged fingers for some time until
he got the knack of polishing bushings and leaving his fingers intact.
Since he was paid by the piece, the more bushings he polished, the
more money he made. He worked hard at developing the necessary
skills to increase his output.
   Spiritual gifts involve skills that the Lord designs for us to use in the
advancement of the kingdom. It takes work, study, and experience to
polish and perfect the skills that accompany your gift or gifts.

IDENTIFYING AND DEVELOPING YOUR SPIRITUAL GIFTS—
PART 1 (Eph. 4:12-16).

   Spiritual gifts are identified and verified using a four-stage pro-
cedure:
   1. Take an inventory or test indicating your most obvious gifts.
      (See Friday's lesson for some ideas of where to get such a test.)
   2. Have the church body verify your findings.
   3. Through intercessory prayer, ask the Lord to confirm your gifts
      (James 1:5).
   4. Use your gifts in ministry.

   Do spiritual gifts need to be developed? Eph. 4:12-16.


   Spiritual gifts are not assigned as "adults." The ability to use the
gift goes with the assignment, but it is our responsibility to become
proficient in the use of our gifts. Once we know what our gifts are, we
need to develop them into effective ministries.

   Developing a Spiritual Gift—a Case Study. Assume you have
been given the gift of teaching. How can you develop that gift? Study
the following chart, and note the procedure used to develop a gift.
Then make a similar chart for a gift you know you have, and make a
plan for developing that gift.

IDENTIFYING AND DEVELOPING YOUR SPIRITUAL GIFTS—
PART 2.

   Looking at your own inward convictions. Your experience in the
Christian life and your service to the church have already taught you
some things about spiritual gifts. You may not have thought of it in the
same way we have studied in this quarterly, but you may already be
exercising your gifts. Fill out the following inward-conviction ques-
tionnaire.

   1. I have a growing conviction and restlessness in my heart that
      tells me I ought to be doing the following in the church:
      a. I should become involved in
      b. I know about a special need that I could fill. (Describe that
          need.)
      c. Which of the spiritual gifts best relate to this conviction I
          have?

   2. I am certain that God has called me to a specific ministry.
      (Describe that ministry.)

   3. What gifts are necessary for that ministry? Do I feel I have them?

   4. Do I truly feel that God could develop that gift in me? Is it
      important for the church that He do so?

   5. Am I willing to carry out that ministry consistently with convic-
      tion and expertise?

   6. Of all the Christians I know, the ministry of which two has
      impressed me most?
      a. What gifts do these two persons have?
      b. Are those the same gifts I feel I have, and could I accomplish
         a ministry similar to theirs?

   Basic principles to keep in mind:
   1. A restless, growing conviction is often the first sign that God is
      endowing you with a combination of gifts necessary to meet a
      need in the church.

   2. A specific call by the Lord to a ministry will inevitably be
      accompanied by the gifts that will make that ministry effective,
      provided a person's motivation and attitude follow biblical guide-
      lines and principles.

IDENTIFYING AND DEVELOPING YOUR SPIRITUAL GIFTS—
PART 3.

   Sunday's lesson contained a short case study of how to develop the
gift of teaching and an example of how to develop any spiritual gift.
Today we look at another case study, using the gift of evangelism as an
example.
   Though evangelism often refers to public meetings, the gift of
evangelism really means that a person has the ability to lead people to
decisions for the Lord. Evangelists win converts.

   Types of Evangelism. There are many types of evangelism. Some
types are witnessing approaches in which all Christians can and should

farther down you move on the chart below, the more you need the gift
of evangelism to accomplish the objective. Notice how other gifts may
cooperate with the gift of evangelism at certain points.

   If you have this gift, you can follow a four-step plan:

   1. Know the essentials of the gospel. Study Bible doctrines and the
      evangelistic accounts in the book of Acts.

   2. Learn friendship evangelism. Take a friendship-evangelism
      seminar, and apply the principles.

   3. Observe someone with this gift. Seek assistance from people
      with related gifts. Read books on the subject.

   4. Try out your new skills. Practice and continue studying.

VERIFYING YOUR SPIRITUAL GIFTS (Acts 13:1-3).

   Spiritual gifts are verified in two ways: first, by confirmation by
the church body, and, second, by the Lord as believers engage in
intercessory prayer.

  Who affirmed Paul and Barnabas in their gifts and ministry?
Acts 13:1-3. Who affirmed Timothy? 1 Tim. 4:11-14.

SPIRITUAL GIFTS CAN BE ABUSED (Matt. 25:14-30).

  Spiritual gifts are assigned by the Holy Spirit to advance the king-
dom. Possession of a particular gift does not make anyone superior to
anyone else, nor is it a measure of holiness or dedication.

   Read the parable of the talents in Matthew 25:14-30. Who
became the "worthless servant" (NIV), and why? How does Paul
pinpoint the underlying problem of abuse of spiritual gifts? Rom.
12:3.


  Notice that the only person Jesus condemned in this parable was the
one who did not use any gift. He made no distinction between the
person with five talents and the person with two. There are two pri-
mary ways in which spiritual gifts are often abused.

   Gift Projection—"Why don't you do what I do?" Gift projection
assumes that everyone else ought to have the same gift I have. Gift
projection is often indulged by people with the gifts of knowledge,
faith, evangelism, and discernment of spirits.
   People with the gift of knowledge are tempted to say, "But every-
one knows . . ." Those with the gift of faith tend to declare, "Where's
your faith . . ." Those with the gift of evangelism often assume that
people without this gift "don't work" for the Lord. People with the gift
of discernment tend to say, "but can't you see . . ."

   Gift Exaltation—"My gift is better than yours!" Gift exaltation
is an attitude, often unconscious, that a certain gift is a spiritual status
symbol. Those without it are given the impression that they are
second-class citizens of the kingdom.
    People who have some of the power or sign gifts, or highly goal-
oriented gifts like evangelism, often project this attitude, even though
they may not mean to do so consciously. There are large segments of
the Christian community, for instance, who sincerely believe that un-
less one speaks in tongues, he or she is not "affirmed" by the Lord and
is not yet a true citizen of the kingdom. People with the gift of
evangelism often assume that all Christians are evangelists, and if they
don't do that job, then they are letting the Lord down.

   What does Paul specifically say about these attitudes? Rom.
12:1-8; 1 Cor. 12:12-26.




                                                                        93

FURTHER STUDY: The Seventh-day Adventist Church produces an
excellent series of study materials on spiritual gifts authored by Dr.
Roy Naden, entitled Your Spiritual Gifts: Making the Great Discovery
(Berrien Springs, Mich.: Instructional Product Development, 1989).
The set includes videos, an instruction book, and a spiritual-gifts
inventory.
   A spiritual-gifts inventory called Finding Your Spiritual Gifts: Wagner-
Modified Houts Questionnaire is available from many ABC's and
conference offices. The same questionnaire is found in C. Peter Wagner,
Your Spiritual Gifts Can Help Your Church Grow, revised edition
(Ventura, Calif.: Regal Books, 1994).
   Read "Talents," Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 325-365, for more
information on the parable of the talents. Look for the principles that
are to direct our use of talents.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Have you had an experience with someone who indulges in
     gift projection? Relate the experience. What did you do to
     resolve the situation? Discuss how you can personally avoid
     such problems.

   2. Have you had any experience with someone who indulges in
      gift exaltation? Relate the experience. What did you do to
      resolve the situation? Discuss how you can personally avoid
      such problems.

SUMMARY: Spiritual gifts need to be identified and developed. This
is done through a four-stage process. This lesson has described the
process and provided some case studies as examples.

                                   J. Lynn Martell

            Carolyn put the telephone receiver back on the hook. Her
         mother's words still rang in her ear: Her father had been strug-
         gling with cancer and emphysema, but he was losing the battle.
         Could she come right away?
            Although Carolyn had beenreared in a Christian home, both
         she and her family had strayed from their faith. Now, when death
         seemed imminent, she did not know what to say to give her father
         hope--or to shore up her own faith. Realizing that she did not
         know God as she should, she spent time fasting and praying,
         asking God for spiritual restoration to enable her to comfort and
         help her father.
            God came near to her, giving her the assurance of His love and
         acceptance. With new hope she traveled to the island of Hawaii,
         where her parents lived. She spent an entire night reading the
         Bible to her father and talking to him about salvation. He renewed
         his faith in Christ and accepted Jesus as his Saviour just before he
         died.
            After the funeral Carolyn returned home and continued to
         nurture her new relationship with God. She began searching for a
         church that would meet her spiritual needs. She attended several
         churches, but was not satisfied with any of them.
            One day her husband, Taeleipu (Ipu, for short), a post-office
         worker, noticed a brochure for the Discoveries in Prophecy semi-
         nars as he sorted mail. As a child he had known some Adventists
         in his homeland of Samoa. Although he also had a Christian
         background, he no longer attended church. But he knew his wife
         was searching, and brought one of the brochures home for her.
         When she lost it, he found another one in the trash at work. This
         time he suggested that she attend. He even offered to care for the
         children so she could go.
            Carolyn began attending the meetings. After each meeting she
         shared what she had learned with her husband. He listened and
         willingly accepted each truth.
            When Ipu needed surgery, members of the Adventist church
         visited him in the hospital. Their caring attitude deeply impressed
         him. Ipu decided that the Adventist faith must be real, and decided
         to attend church and be baptized. Today Ipu and Carolyn rejoice
         in their new walk with God, forged in the face of death.

  Converting Spiritual Gifts
      Into Ministries




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Rom. 12:1-3; 2 Tim. 2:15;
Heb. 6:12.

   MEMORY TEXT: "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the
   mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice,
   holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service"
   (Romans 12:1, NKJV).

  KEY THOUGHT: The Lord assigns spiritual gifts to every new-
born Christian. One or more of these gifts will be permanent, lifelong
ministries that will be the primary focus of a person's discipleship.

   ONCE SPIRITUAL GIFTS ARE IDENTIFIED, THE NEXT
STEP IS TO DEVELOP THEM INTO MINISTRIES. This is done
through study, attendance at training sessions and seminars, and through
use and practice. The Lord expects Christians to "professionalize"
their ministries and develop them to the best of their ability.
   Because you have received a personal calling from the Lord, it is up
to you to put your ministry into practice on a regular basis. Throughout
your lifetime, your principal roles in the church should be compatible
with your spiritual gifts. There may be times when the needs of the
kingdom require you to perform a role or function that is outside your
regular ministry or not directly related to your particular gifts, but this
will be a temporary situation. Most of the time, you will function
within the context of your primary spiritual gifts.
   One caution! The Lord calls you to a ministry for His glory—not
your own! Spiritual gifts are given for the advancement of the king-
dom. (See Gal. 5:22, 23.)

DEVELOPING SPIRITUAL GIFTS INTO MINISTRIES (2 Cor.
5:18, 19).

   God's purpose in assigning spiritual gifts to church members is to
enable them to minister to others. (See I Tim. 4:14-16; 2 Tim. 2:15;
Eph. 4:15, 16.) Unselfish use of our gifts brings blessing and salvation
to others. Study the following chart. It will give you an idea of the
kinds of ministry that might develop out of each gift.

DESIGNING A MINISTRY

   The first step in designing a ministry is to decide what roles or
ministries in the already existing church structure fit your gifts. The
second step is to determine what ministries need to be added to the
existing ones so that your gifts can be used adequately.

   List your three primary spiritual gifts: (If you haven't taken a
spiritual-gifts inventory, do the best you can.)

1.
2.
3.

     Fit your gifts into one or more of the following three categories:
     1. Gifts dealing with outreach and evangelism, resulting in the
         numerical growth of the church.

           Evangelism                   Tongues
           Miracles                     Interpretation of tongues
           Healing                      Voluntary poverty
           Mercy                        Deliverance (exorcism)

     2. Gifts dealing with the spiritual maturity of the church. These
        are gifts fostering spiritual growth, providing discipleship training,
        and membership support.

           Prophecy                     Exhortation or encouragement
           Teaching                     Discernment of spirits
           Pastor                       Faith
           Knowledge                    Intercessory prayer
           Wisdom                       Hospitality

     3. Gifts dealing with the administrative functions of the church,
        such as financial management, maintenance of physical facili-
        ties, and membership support.

           Leadership                   Administration
           Helps                        Service
           Giving

    What roles, offices, or positions in the regular church struc-
 ture fit your gifts? So that your gifts are used adequately, what
 ministries could be started in your church?

STUDY AND KNOWLEDGE (2 Tim. 2:15).

   Spiritual gifts, as we have seen, do not develop themselves. As you
convert your gifts into ministries, you may have to do considerable
study to gain the knowledge necessary to carry out effectively your
ministry or ministries.

  What does the Bible say about well-thought-out, well-organized
ministries?

2 Tim. 2:15

Eccl. 9:10

Rom. 12:11

Heb. 6:12

   "It is not a virtue for men or women to excuse slow bungling at
work of any character. The slow habits must be overcome. The man
who is slow, and does his work at a disadvantage, is an unprofitable
workman. . . . Dullness and ignorance are no virtue. . . . 'Whatsoever
thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.' Not slothful in business;
fervent in spirit; serving the Lord.' "—Fundamentals of Christian
Education, p. 316.

   How did Paul prepare himself for his new ministry when the
Lord called him as a missionary to the Gentiles? Gal. 1:11-18.
What did Paul especially want when in prison in Rome? 2 Tim.
4:13. How did Luke prepare himself to write the books of Luke
and Acts? Luke 1:1-4.


   All ministries take study, planning, and organization. In the
space below, write down some resources you know you will need
for your chosen ministry. Which resources are already available?
Which do you need to find and obtain?




    Make a list of books you should read that discuss your minis-
 try and a list of seminars or training sessions you should attend.
 Where can you find these resources?

                                                                    99

COOPERATIVE VENTURES (1 Cor. 12:12-27).

   Individual spiritual gifts rarely function as isolated entities. They
are designed to function in conjunction with other gifts. That is why
the Holy Spirit assigns various gifts to people and to church congrega-
tions. As you develop your gift-based ministry, you will need to
develop cooperative ventures with other people.

   What did Paul say about the unifying purpose of spiritual gifts?
1 Cor. 12:12-27.


   We have read this text many times during the quarter. It is so
important because it is the key to the effectiveness of church organiza-
tion based on spiritual gifts. These verses, along with Romans 12:1-5,
outline what church unity means. It does not mean uniformity. It means
that each person does his or her task or ministry in the right spirit and
for the right reasons. When planning is done, it is done with an eye to
God's glory. This spirit avoids all kinds of personality conflicts and
discussion of peripheral issues that have little or nothing to do with the
advancement of the kingdom.

   Use the following chart for finding and enlisting the coopera-
tive ventures you need for your ministry.

       Skills Needed                 Gifts or Help Needed
 People skills             What people skills will you need to carry
                           out this ministry?

 Training                  What kind of training will the people who
                           work with you need, and where can they
                           receive it?

 Support groups            What kinds of support groups do you
                           need to help make your ministry a
                           success? Find some people who will
                           counterbalance your temperament.

 Resource support          What kind of resource support do you
                           need? For instance, if you don't like to
                           study and do research, find someone else
                           to do this part of the ministry. You may
                           also need to find someone who can give
                           financial support to your ministry.

PLAN OF ACTION

   This is your operational plan. You need to meet somewhere, have a
schedule, and get your ministry started. You also need to learn how to
recruit and use volunteers to help you in your ministry, if it is a
cooperative venture.

  Base of operations: Where will your base of operations be? Your
home, the church, etc? Will you need to rent a building or office.
Where will you meet?

   Building a schedule: How often will you meet? Does everyone
helping you have to be there all the time? Who will help you organize
this schedule?

  How will you go about starting your ministry? With whom do
you need to talk? What authorizations will you need?

   Developing a time line for your ministry. It usually takes about
three months to plan and organize a new ministry. If you try to do it
faster, something will be left out, and the project will probably fail.
Don't be impatient. Do it once, and do it right.

   On the following chart, write down what you expect to accom-
plish during each of the time periods:

Three months

One year

Long range

Using volunteers

   Volunteers in today's societies require five things:

   1. Clearly defined tasks with definite limits.

   2. Short terms in office.

   3. Plenty of human resources to employ in attaining the goal.

   4. Simple, direct feedback about how the volunteers are doing.

   5. Lots of affirmation.

FURTHER STUDY: Seminars and training sessions on spiritual gifts
are often given by your mission or conference departments. Attend as
many of these as you can. They will be helpful. Check with your local
Adventist Book Center to see what materials they carry.
   Read the book of Acts in the Bible and The Acts of the Apostles by
Ellen White. Do a study on the spiritual gifts of the people mentioned
and how they used these gifts in ministry. Notice how it is possible to
identify with some accuracy the gifts of some of the people mentioned
less often. Ascertain how these people used these gifts.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Discuss the five elements that today's volunteers look for. Is
     that true in your church? How can you organize ways of
     getting more people to participate?

   2. Is the following statement true or false? "If people were
      really dedicated to the Lord, we wouldn't have any problem
      getting people to volunteer." Explain your answer.

   3. Someone said, "I shouldn't have to do any of this. That's
      why we have a pastor. That's his job. He should get all the
      volunteers and get the church working." True or false?
      Discuss your answer.

SUMMARY: The Holy Spirit's purpose in assigning spiritual gifts is
that a person's primary gifts become the framework for lifelong minis-
try. There are many types of activities that fit gifts, but planning and
organization are essential for the success of a ministry. It is each
person's responsibility to learn how to carry out his or her ministry
effectively and proficiently. Part of that training includes learning how
to motivate people and use resources. Cooperative ventures with other
people are important.

                    Light in the Darkness
                           Edwin Eisele

   Satan may be the defeated foe, but he does not give up easily,
especially in countries where he has held sway for centuries.
   The country of Togo, in West Africa, is known as the center of
voodoo worship in the world. People who discard their fetishes
and voodoo charms in order to worship Jesus Christ often do so at
great personal expense.
   When Yaovi (Yah-OO-vee), a former voodoo priest, accepted
Jesus Christ last year, he and his family asked Pastor David to
help him destroy his voodoo charms and fetishes that had been
the center of his life. He and his wife and a handful of Adventists
gathered in a field where Yaovi placed his idols and fetishes. The
pastor prayed, then they lit the pile.
   The fire drew a crowd of more than 50 curious villagers who
stopped to investigate the fire. Some older folks became angry
when they learned that Yaovi was destroying his fetishes. They
threatened to harm him if he continued.
   Yaovi tried to reason with the people. He explained that these
were just pieces of wood and stone, and he was destroying them
because he had accepted Jesus Christ as the Lord of his life. But
his word only made the crowd angrier.
   Someone threw a stone at Yaovi. Another cried out, "Let's burn
the pastor's motorcycle! He's the one responsible for this!" The
crows surged forward and began throwing stones and beating on
Pastor David and Yaovi. But Yaovi's wife defended him, the crowd
backed away, allowing the pastor and former voodoo priest to
escape. Yaovi and his wife fled to the home of another Christian,
who notified the police. The police arrived at Yaovi's home and
found the mob had tied up his entire family and were beating them.
Had the police not come, the family would have been killed.
   Yaovi was not discouraged. He thanked God that he had been
                          called upon to suffer for Jesus. And Pas-
                          tor David reaffirmed his intention to re-
                          turn to minister in the village. "I have
                          dedicated my life to bring the light of the
                          gospel to those in darkness. We must build
                          a church in this stronghold of Satan and
                          voodoo worship."

        Using Your Spiritual
        Gifts in Your Church




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Gal. 5:22, 23; 1 Cor. 12:7;
John 13:34; Rom. 14:13, 19; Gal. 5:13, 14.

   MEMORY TEXT: "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy,
   peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and
   self-control. Against such things there is no law" (Galatians
   5:22, 23, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Each member and each congregation have a
combination of gifts that determine the ministries a congregation can
efficiently carry out. The organization of a congregation should take
into account its mixture of gifts.

    FITNESS TO SERVE. Seventh-day Adventist churches are usu-
ally organized around officers (elders, deacons, deaconesses, clerks,
and treasurers) and departments (Sabbath School, Adventist Youth,
etc.). Usually the annual nominating committee fills the list of posi-
tions given in the Church Manual.
    According to the Church Manual, the nominating committee has a
twofold purpose: (1) to give careful study to the needs of the church
and (2) to make careful inquiry into the fitness of members to serve.
    Often "fitness to serve" is overlooked or ignored by nominating
committees. Too often, "fitness to serve" is restricted to a person's
availability, seniority, or social standing. "Fitness to serve" means that
the nominating committee must decide regarding an individual's spir-
itual maturity. The committee must assure the church that a nominee's
life shows no visible signs of unbecoming conduct. "Fitness to serve"
should include the identifiable spiritual giftedness of those appointed.

ONE ANOTHER (John 13:34).

   The Greek word translated "one another" is used 76 times in the
New Testament. The uses of this word give a picture of what could be
called the corporate Christian personality of a local church.

   Look up the following texts. Each represents a "one another"
statement in the category on the chart.
       Category               Texts                Comments
 Interrelationships       John 13:34
 Negative commands        Rom. 14:13
 Mutual edification       Rom. 14:19
 Mutual service           Gal. 5:13, 14
   These categories represent an interdependent ministry in which
members develop Christian characters and personalities for the benefit
of all (Gal. 5:22). This ministry includes the use of spiritual gifts.
   Notice how spiritual gifts are related to the overall corporate per-
sonality and function of a church congregation (1 Cor. 12:7; 13).
Notice also how reciprocal living and spiritual gifts complement each
other:
  Spiritual Gift                  Corporate Personality
 Teaching             "Teach . . . one another" (Col. 3:16, NIV).
 Exhortation/         "Encourage one another" (1 Thess. 5:11, NIV).
 encouragement
 Faith                "Pray for each other" (James 5:16, NIV).
 Prophecy             "Mutual edification" (Rom. 14:19, NIV).
 Helping              "Serve one another in love" (Gal. 5:13, 14,
                      NIV).
   "One another" commands in the Bible: Without giving all the
references, we can list some of these commands. Inspired writers
urge us to love one another, receive one another, greet one another,
care for one another, be patient with one another, make things right
with one another, and forgive one another. What unity would prevail
in the church if these injunctions were followed! There would be no
cruel judging of other people's characters. There would be no unkind
criticism or envy of others. There would be mutual respect between
races, sexes, social and economic classes. In fact, the church would
be a foretaste of heaven. "The characteristics most needful to be
cherished by God's commandment-keeping people are patience and
long-suffering, peace and love"—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 398.

                                                                    105

IDENTIFYING YOUR CHURCH'S COMBINATION OF GIFTS

   Once individual members identify their gifts and ministries, a church
congregation can categorize its primary and secondary combinations
of gifts by ranking the gifts of the members. A church can then develop
programs and projects that utilize the giftedness of its members.
   This corporate giftedness may change as members come and go. An
annual evaluation of giftedness as part of the nominating committee
process will indicate the changes that have taken place. Once a congre-
gation has been surveyed for spiritual giftedness, all you need is a
yearly update of new and/or formerly nonparticipating members to
keep your corporate-giftedness information up to date.

   Are there any combinations of gifts that are essential for the
efficient functioning of the church?


    There are four sets of gifts that are always needed and will, almost
always, appear in the church. If one of these sets of gifts is missing, the
church must pray earnestly that the Lord will provide it, either by
calling someone within the church, or sending someone with that gift
to the church.

   Set one:      gifts of evangelism
   Set two:      gifts of leadership and administration
   Set three:    gifts of pastoring and hospitality
   Set four:     gifts of teaching

    Tasks and spiritual gifts. When Paul outlined a philosophy of
ministry built around spiritual gifts, there were no church buildings to
maintain, no zoning laws with which to struggle, no building codes or
fire inspections, no denominational organizations, no income-tax laws
or medical plans, no monthly treasurer's reports. There were few of
the multitudinous church tasks that keep congregations busy today.
Spiritual gifts were focused on ministry, primarily church planting and
growth.
    Sometimes a person may have a mixture of gifts that includes
secondary gifts that fit certain church tasks but do not form part of that
person's primary ministry choice. The Lord will amplify these second-
ary gifts for the good of the kingdom and confirm and bless abun-
dantly the person's ministry. But this should be a temporary situation
until someone with a more appropriate mixture of gifts appears on the
scene. A Christian spirit enables an individual to accept the fact that
others are more qualified by their gifts to perform certain functions.
Humility bows to the Lord's leading.

ORGANIZING YOUR CHURCH AROUND SPIRITUAL GIFTS
(Matt. 28:16-20).

  Today's lesson outlines a way of organizing your church personnel
and program using spiritual gifts.
  The system described in this lesson is built around four sets of
general frameworks for ministry:
   1. the soul-winning mandate of the great commission (Matt. 28:16-
      20).
  2. the administration of the church itself.
   3. the needs of the congregation.
   4. the needs of the community served by the church.

   Because any or all of these may change periodically, the system is
never static. Because the system is needs-based and administered
through spiritual giftedness, it is always active and sensitive to the
leading of the Holy Spirit. A system of this type cannot become static
unless it is forced into an artificial mold.

   Stage 1: Form a Prayer and Planning Commission. This commis-
sion will seek, through prayer, the will and blessing of the Lord in
discovering and meeting the needs of the church and the community.
The Lord will reveal the spiritual gifts of the members and the plan for
ministries that will employ those gifts for the church and the commu-
nity.

   Stage 2: The Prayer and Planning Commission is divided into
three task forces. Each task force has a specific job description and a
time line within which to work. Once the task forces have finished
compiling their information, the Prayer and Planning Commission will
present a report to the nominating committee.

  Task force 1: The needs of the church. This task force will use a
questionnaire to survey the congregation regarding the needs of the
church itself.

   Task force 2: Spiritual gifts of the community. This task force
will survey the community and update demographic data.

  Task force 3: Spiritual gifts of the church. This task force will
update information on the spiritual giftedness of the congregation.

   How could this system be implemented in your church? Dis-
 cuss this in your class.


                                                                   107

PUTTING SPIRITUAL GIFTS TO WORK: A CASE STUDY.

   Read the following story, and fill in the blanks at the end. Discuss
the story and your answers with your class. See Friday's lesson for
answers.
   A small group of about 15 people from the same church meets
together once a week. The group shares needs, experiences, and con-
cerns. They have a good relationship, and the meetings are productive
and helpful. They spend time in Bible study and prayer. Here is a
sample of the conversations that take place:
   Mary: "Pete, when you explain things as you did about those
puzzling verses, I really see what they mean and what God is saying. I
like the way you related those verses to the whole book we were
studying."
   John: "Mary, that was a beautiful experience you shared. I don't
see how you can work in that soup kitchen in the inner-city area and
love those people the way you do. But I admire you and can see how
the Lord works through you."
   Pete: "John, when you shared how God met your needs through that
passage in 2 Corinthians, I can't tell you how encouraging it was to
me. I'm experiencing a problem like that, and God used you to help me
face it."
   Martha: "I believe God wants the kind of warm, vital fellowship
we have to spread through our whole church. I have a growing convic-
tion that God is going to do some spectacular things in our church. I
have this deep conviction that a year from now this church is really
going to take off. I can just see how John 17 will be a reality in our
church."
   Jerry: "I made another friend at work this week. I shared my
experience with him, and he wants to take Bible studies. Just think, it
might not be long before he joins us in this group, and maybe the
church. I can hardly wait!"

   If these conversations are typical, you can probably assume that

Mary has the gift of
John has the gift of
Pete has the gift of
Martha has the gift of
Jerry has the gift of

   Can you relate experiences in which you have become aware
of people's spiritual gifts? How can your church help individu-
als use their gifts effectively?

SUMMARY: Spiritual gifts are the tools the Holy Spirit provides
believers to facilitate the work of the kingdom. We are all responsible
to the Lord for how we employ those tools. The church progresses

    N;Eig7                         Just One Book
                                 Luis Humberto Orjuela

            While literature evangelists Luis Garcia and Roylan Lopez were
        canvassing in the East Venezuela town of San Felix, they met a
        young teacher named Yuraima (Yu-RI-mah) Cabrera. Even though
        she was of another faith, she bought a large selection of books.
        When the men delivered the books, they gave her a copy of The
        Great Controversy.
            The following week the two workers met Yuraima on the street.
        She told them, "I have read The Great Controversy. It had a great
        impact on me. I have been looking for you ever since." The book
        had convinced her of the Sabbath truth, and she wanted to know
        more about Seventh-day Adventists. The two men made arrange-
        ments to visit her that night.
            After praying fervently, the men went to her home and studied
        with her for several hours. She was eager to learn how to keep the
        Sabbath. Shetold them that she had loaned the book to her sister
        Arelis, who was reading it. She urged the men to visit her, as well.
            A few days later the men visited Arelis (Ah-RAY-lees) Cabrera
        and her daughter. The mother and daughter told them that they had
        visited many churches, trying to satisfy their spiritual needs, but
        had not found the right one. As the men studied with these two
        women, they gladly accepted the Sabbath truth and began attend-
        ing the Adventist church.
            A few weeks later the men visited Mrs. Cabrera's mother. The
        older woman told the colporteurs that for years she had been
        listening to the Voice of Hope (Voice of Prophecy) radio program
        and said that she would attend no other church than the one spon-
        soring that program. She was overjoyed when the men told her that
        they represented that church.
            The chain of conversions continued. Yuraima introduced them
         to a friend who works in the University of Guyana who was
         reading The Great Controversy.
            A few months after the men had first met the sisters, they were
         invited to a baptism--of Yuraima, Arelis, Arelis' daughter, and her
         friend. Today, Yuraima's son and two of her brothers have also
         joined the church, and another sister is receiving Bible studies.
         Only eternity will reveal the results of reading just one book.
