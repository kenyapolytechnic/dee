            See what you've been missing!
   Educators have long known the power of visual aids. Jesus Himself often
used the objects of the visual world to teach His spiritual lessons effectively.
   Now this tremendous combination of the word spoken and the word seen is
available through the new adult Sabbath School theme videos.
   Professionally produced by the Church Ministries department, these videos
are a special blessing to Sabbath School students, shut-ins, small groups, and
isolated members.
     Available each quarter from your Adventist Book Center.

How the Sabbath School
 Lessons Are Produced
   Because we often are asked to explain the procedure by
which the adult Sabbath School lessons are prepared, we are
including here a brief description of the process.
   Authors are selected from around the world field and are
given specific guidelines regarding content, format, length,
writing style, etc. When a manuscript is submitted to the Sab-
bath School lesson editor, it is pfesented without alteration to
the General Conference Resident Reading Committee. This
committee consists of competent Bible scholars, departmental
leaders, administrators, pastors, and lay members. Committee
members read the manuscript, write their reactions and sugges-
tions, and attend a special meeting at which the manuscript is
discussed in detail. Then a vote is taken as to whether the
manuscript should be accepted for publication.
   On the basis of the suggestions of the local reading commit-
tee, the accepted manuscript is edited and sent out to the World
Reading Committee. Every division of the world field has rep-
resentatives on this larger committee. These people read the
manuscript and mail their suggested changes to the editor. The
editor then edits the manuscript a second time, giving careful
attention to the changes requested by the members of the World
Reading Committee. A final vote is given by the Resident Read-
ing Committee before the manuscript is sent to the Press and to
the world field for translation.
   No one person writes the Adult Sabbath School Lessons.
The original author is the principal contributor, but the thought
of many Adventist leaders around the world is incorporated
into the quarterly. The aim is to produce lessons that are
thoroughly representative of the spiritual and theological com-
mitments of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. No one person,
including the author, has all his ideas included in the quarterly.
The material published consists of the consensus of two very
competent reading committees.
   Every attempt is made to exdude theological and mechanical
error from the quarterly. Obviously in a task of this magnitude,
involving somewhat detailed interpretations of Scripture, some of
our members will have opinions on some Bible passages that vary
somewhat from those published in the quarterly. We grow as we
study, and in the process we may see some things differently. Even
so, the adult Sabbath School quarterly editors and reading commit-
tee members are committed to presenting as carefully as possible the
scriptural understandings of mainline Seventh-day Adventism.

       Introduction to the Health Lessons

          Look Up and Live
   "This Is Where You Can Find Some of Life's Greatest Returns,"
blazed the headline of the bank advertisement. But the fine print
wasn't far below. And yes, it contained plenty of restrictions.
   Despite this fine print, most of us are interested in managing our
money wisely. Certainly we benefit by "shopping" for investment
plans that yield the best rates of return.
   Yet how many of us ever think of our health in terms of an invest-
ment? That's how Ellen White considered it when she advised a fel-
low Christian: "Health may be earned by proper habits of life and
may be made to yield interest and compound interest."—Testimonies,
vol. 4, p. 408. Ellen White continues with this analogy by saying that
good health is capital "more precious than any bank deposit."
   As you study your Bible with the help of this quarterly, think of it
as a passbook to a special account that will yield some of life's great-
est returns. But, unlike the bank advertisement, you won't be intimi-
dated by fine-print restrictions, because there aren't any!
   Another advertisement reads, "This Is the Ad Our Competition
Hopes You Won't Read." Yes, Satan has long realized that people
who indulge in poor health habits have a difficult time understanding
God's will for their lives. So he is hoping you won't study these les-
sons. We hope and pray that you will, and that God will bless your
study.
   And as God blesses your study, look for ways to share those bless-
ings with others. As Seventh-day Adventists, we can delight in the
fact that our church has recognized the relationship between health
and spirituality since 1863. The current worldwide interest in health
provides a special opportunity for us to draw many souls to Jesus,
who is the great originator of life and maintainer of health, both
physically and spiritually. "Many have no faith in God and have lost
confidence in man. But they appreciate acts of sympathy and helpful-
ness. As they see one with no inducement of earthly praise or com-
pensation come into their homes, ministering to the sick, feeding the
 hungry, clothing the naked, comforting the sad, and tenderly pointing
all to Him of whose love and pity the human worker is but the mes-
senger . . . their hearts are touched. . . . Faith is kindled. They see that
God cares for them, and they are prepared to listen as His word is
 opened."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 145.




         These lessons were prepared in consultation
       with the General Conference Health and Temper-
       ance Department.

Lesson 1                        December 27-January 2

          Why Be Healthy?




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Gen. 1-3; Rom. 3:23-28;
Eze. 36:25-27; Mark 5:25-34; James 2:17-26.
    MEMORY TEXT: "I will restore health unto thee, and I
    will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the Lord" (Jeremiah
    30:17).
   KEY THOUGHT: Good health is the result of obeying God's
natural and moral laws. The gospel of Christ frees us from
habits that endanger our health and gives us the power to de-
velop a healthful lifestyle.
    GOOD HEALTH CAN BE YOURS. Why do you want to be
healthy? There's the obvious reason that good health makes life
easier and more pleasant. Yet for a Christian, the answer is
more involved. Ellen White states in The Ministry of Healing,
pages 128 and 130, that "whatever injures the health, not only
lessens physical vigor, but tends to weaken the mental and
moral powers. Indulgence in any unhealthful practice makes it
more difficult for one to discriminate between right and wrong,
and hence more difficult to resist evil. . . .
   "The body is the only medium through which the mind and
the soul are developed for the upbuilding of character."
   This is why the gospel includes not only spiritual restoration
but physical restoration, as well. As you study this week's les-
son, pray for the power to develop and maintain a healthful
lifestyle.

Sunday                                    December 27
"AND GOD CREATED" (Genesis 1 and 2).

  To understand better how the gospel frees us from habits
that endanger our health and how it gives us the power to
develop a healthful lifestyle, we should go back to the begin-
ning of time. After each day's work, God viewed what He had
created and pronounced it good. But it wasn't until after He
created Adam and Eve that He pronounced everything He
made as very good.

   How were Adam and Eve different from the rest of God's
creation? Gen. 1:26, 27.


  Of all God's creation, Adam and Eve were the only beings
with the ability to relate to God.
  "The Lord blessed Adam and Eve with intelligence such as
He had not given to any other creature. . . . Man, made in the
divine image, could contemplate and appreciate the glorious
works of God in nature."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 1082.

  What can we conclude about Adam's and Eve's health, and
why?


  It's impossible to imagine that Adam and Eve were anything
but vigorous and robust. Indeed, "man came from the hand of
God perfect in every faculty of mind and body."—Testimonies,
vol. 4, p. 29 (italics supplied).

  List the words and phrases in Genesis 1 and 2 that suggest
that God created in an orderly, "law-abiding" way.


   "God has ordained laws for the government . . . of all the
operations of nature. Everything is under fixed laws, which
cannot be disregarded. But while everything in nature is gov-
erned by natural laws, man alone . . . is amenable to moral
law."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 52.
   And as long as Adam and Eve obeyed God's moral law, they
enjoyed their health and happiness.

   What does it mean to you personally that God created you
in His image? How have you been relating to Him?
                                                             7
Monday                                        December 28
UNFAITHFUL, UNHAPPY, UNHEALTHY, UNSAVED (Gen-
esis 3).
   As long as Adam and Eve chose to remain faithful to God's
laws they could enjoy health, happiness, and eternal life. But
Genesis 3 describes their unfaithfulness and the need for a plan
of redemption.
   Many people talk about Adam and Eve eating from the tree
of knowledge of good and evil as if it were something about
its fruit that was evil. But where did the evil really lie? Gen.
2:16, 17; 3:1-6.

   By choosing not to trust God, Adam and Eve showed that
Satan's promise was more appealing to them than the relation-
ship they shared with their Creator.
  Review the consequences of Adam and Eve's decision in
Genesis 3:7-13, 16-19, 23, 24.

    What promise do we find in Genesis 3:15?

   "I will put enmity." "This judgment, expressed in prophetic
language, has ever been understood by the Christian church as
a prediction of the coming of the Deliverer."—SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 1, pp. 232, 233.
   "Between thy seed and her seed." This refers to the conflict
between Satan's followers (1 John 3:10) and Christ, who is the
seed (Rev. 12:1-5; Gal. 3:16, 19).
   "It shall bruise thy head." Bruise means "to crush."
   Thus Genesis 3:15 provides us with the first record of the great
controversy that began in heaven (Rev. 12:7-9), continues on
earth, where Christ defeated Satan again (Heb. 2:14), and will end
with Satan's extinction at the end of the millennium (Rev. 20:10).
   Now Adam and Eve's relationship with God depended on
their faith in this promise of a coming Saviour. Through Christ,
Satan and sin are defeated, and humankind is granted the power
to obey God's natural and moral laws that govern health.
  Imagine the comfort this announcement must have been to
Adam and Eve. What hope does it bring to you?

Tuesday                                      December 29
IN HARMONY AGAIN (Gen. 2:17; Rom. 3:23-28;1 Cor. 6:19, 20).
   Adam and Eve chose to disbelieve God. But "divine love had
conceived a plan whereby man might be redeemed. The broken
law of God demanded the life of the sinner. In all the universe
there was but one who could, in behalf of man, satisfy its
claims. Since the divine law is as sacred as God Himself, only
one equal with God could make atonement for its transgression.
None but Christ could redeem fallen man from the curse of the
law."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 63.

   How is this plan of redemption put to work in individual
lives? Rom. 3:23-28.


   God views us as righteous when through faith we believe
that Christ paid the penalty for our sins. When this happens, we
receive the power of the indwelling Christ (Gal. 2:20). And it is
Christ in us that enables us to keep God's laws, including the
laws of health, as well as the Ten Commandments. Salvation is
a complete gift. God forgives us our sin, then changes our heart,
and restores us mentally, physically, and spiritually.

   Amazing grace. "The world needs today what it needed
nineteen hundred years ago—a revelation of Christ. A great
work of reform is demanded, and it is only through the grace of
Christ that the work of restoration, physical, mental, and spir-
itual, can be accomplished."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 143.
   What reason does Paul give for engaging in life reform?
1 Cor. 6:19, 20? What is the price that verse 20 refers to? 1 Peter
1:18, 19.


   What can you do that you are not doing now to better "glo-
rify God in your body," which belongs to Him?


  Knowing that your body belongs to God and that it is the
only medium through which we learn about Him, which of
your health habits do you think need changing?




                                                                 9
Wednesday                                       December 30
THE SECRET OF SUCCESS (James 2:17-26; Eze. 36:25-27).
  Yesterday we studied God's plan for salvation, which ulti-
mately includes physical, mental, and spiritual restoration.
Briefly review this plan by reading Romans 3:23-28.
    Since we are "justified by faith without the deeds of the
law," where does obedience to God's natural and moral laws
fit in? James 2:17-26.

    A healthful lifestyle will not save us (Gal. 5:4). But if we truly
believe in Christ, the Holy Spirit will help us develop health
habits that keep us alert and strong.
    "While our behavior and our spirituality are closely re-
lated, we can never earn salvation by correct behavior.
Rather, Christian behavior is a natural fruit of salvation and
is grounded in what Christ has already accomplished for us
at Calvary."—Seventh-day Adventists Believe—A Biblical Expo-
sition of Fundamental Doctrines, p. 280.
     What is the secret of obedience? Eze. 36:25-27.

   What provision has God made for the converted Christian
to attain self-control? 1 Cor. 6:11.

   Three important aspects. First Corinthians 6:11 gives three
important aspects of conversion: (1) being washed (being bap-
tized to signify a change of heart); (2) being justified (forgiven;
declared righteous); and (3) being sanctified (receiving the
power to live a new life).
   "By the Spirit of our God." When the Holy Spirit dwells
within, obedience follows. Our faith in Christ makes this possi-
ble. Paul explains in Romans 6:4 that we are buried with Christ
through baptism in order to walk in newness of life. This does
not suggest that the new life justifies us. Rather, the Holy Spirit
brings us into harmony with Christ and His law, even the laws
that govern health.
   Because the Holy Spirit empowers a Christian to obey
God's laws, do you think it is easier for a Christian to develop
a healthful lifestyle?

Thursday                                    December 31
TOUCH HIS GARMENT (Mark 1:30-34; 5:25-34).

   God's plan of redemption includes the restoration of our
physical powers. Today we'll see how Christ demonstrated this
in His earthly life.

  Of the 35 miracles the Gospels record, 19 deal with disease
or deformity. But these specific instances are not the only
times Jesus showed His concern for people's health. Read
Matthew 4:23, 24; 14:35, 36 and Mark 1:30-34.


   "Jesus devoted more time to healing the sick than to preach-
ing. His miracles testified to the truth of His words, that He
came not to destroy, but to save."—The Ministry of Healing,
p. 19.

   In Mark 5:25-34 we find one of the 19 miracles dealing with
disease and deformity. As you read these verses, ask yourself
what this story tells us about the connection between faith
and health.


   "Thy faith hath made thee whole." Jesus wanted the crowd
to know that it was not the touching of His garment, but faith,
that restored the woman's body. To have believed the former
would have been to believe in superstition.

   What does the woman's gesture tell us about the. nature of
faith?


   Our actions mirror our faith. What we do tells others that "it
is not enough to believe about Christ; we must believe in Him.
The only faith that will benefit us is that which embraces Him
as a personal Saviour. . . . Genuine faith is life. A living faith
means an increase of vigor, a confiding trust, by which the soul
becomes a conquering power."—The Desire of Ages, p. 347.

   Review Matthew 4:23, 24; 14:35, 36 and Mark 1:30-34; 5:25-
34. Then put yourself in one of the scenes these verses men-
tion. Imagine that you are struggling through the hordes of
people to reach Jesus. You are within inches of touching Him.
Of what do you want Him to heal you? Is your faith such that
He can make you well?
                                                               11
Friday                                            January 1
FURTHER STUDY: Salvation includes physical restoration, as
well as spiritual. With this thought in mind meditate upon the
following verses: Luke 9:56; John 10:10; 1 Cor. 6:19, 20; Heb.
7:25; 2 Peter 3:9. Also read one or more of the following: Coun-
sels on Health, "The Violation of Physical Law," pp. 19-25, and
"Govern the Body," pp. 41, 42; The Ministry of Healing, "Train-
ing for Life's Conflict," pp. 128-131; The Desire of Ages, "The
Touch of Faith," pp. 342-348.
   While it is true that the gospel frees us from habits that en-
danger our health and helps us to develop a healthful lifestyle,
some people, regardless of how they live, are still more suscep-
tible to disease than others. Furthermore, anyone can contract
poor health owing to circumstances beyond his or her control.
(Ellen G. White experienced ill health throughout her life as a
result of being struck on the nose with a rock at the age of 9.) It
is completely possible to be redeemed from our sins according
to God's plan of salvation, yet still experience sickness. Not
until Christ's return will any of us be totally free from the pros-
pect of illness.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What reassurance can the following quotation give us for
     those times when our health fails us through no fault of
     our own?
       "Often your mind may be clouded because of pain. Then
     do not try to think. You know that Jesus loves you. He
     understands your weakness. You may do His will by sim-
     ply resting in His arms."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 251.
     2. Can you tell in your own words how the gospel of Christ
        frees us from habits that endanger our health, and how it
        gives us the power to develop a healthful lifestyle?
     3. The title of this week's lesson asks, "Why be healthy?"
        How would you answer that question now after a week of
        studying?
SUMMARY: As Christians, we desire to live a healthful life
because Christ redeemed us (1 Cor. 6:19, 20) and because our
bodies are the only medium through which we learn about
Him. The plan of salvation includes our restoration to such a
lifestyle, while at the same time giving us the grace to develop
good health habits.

  healeth thee" (Exodus 15:26).
   KEY THOUGHT: Because the plan of salvation includes our
restoration to health (Lesson 1), the Bible shows us our part in
realizing this goal.
   THEN AND NOW. About the time Moses was born, some-
one wrote the Papyrus Ebers, a first-aid book for Egyptians. To
remove a splinter, the Papyrus Ebers recommended applying
worms' blood and asses' dung. To prevent hair loss, the Papyrus
suggested anointing the hair with the tooth of a donkey crushed
in honey.
   Because Moses was "learned in all the wisdom of the
Egyptians" (Acts 7:22), he was probably well acquainted with
the Papyrus Ebers.
   But when God freed the Israelites, He gave them a different
set of health guidelines along with the promise found in this
week's memory verse. We will study some of these guidelines,
as well as certain New Testament principles, in order to under-
stand further how God has provided for the care and mainte-
nance of our bodies so we can more effectively work for and
learn about Him.

BURDENS (Ex. 6:7; Lev. 11:43-45).
   When God freed the Israelites from Egypt, they had been
slaves for more than 100 years. What would have happened to
them physically and spiritually during this period?

   After these years of slavery, the Israelites were in such a
condition that God found it necessary to reeducate them con-
cerning His plans regarding right living. The laws He gave to
them at Sinai dealt with every aspect of their duty to God and
their fellow human beings. These laws included the following:
(1) the Ten Commandments, which reflect God's character and
are therefore unchangeable because He is unchangeable (Matt.
5:18, 19, Mal. 3:6); (2) the ceremonial laws, which pointed to the
cross and thus expired when Christ died (Col. 2:14-17; Heb.
7:12); (3) the civil laws, which "applied the broad principles of
the Ten Commandments to the economy of ancient Israel as a
nation" (SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 757); and (4) the
health laws. These laws "were intended by a wise Creator to
promote health and longevity (see Ex. 15:26; 23:25; Deut. 7:15;
Ps. 105:37 . . .). Based as they are upon the nature and require-
ments of the human body, these principles could in no way be
affected either by the cross or by the disappearance of Israel as
a nation. Principles that contributed to health 3,500 years ago
will produce the same results today."—SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 1, p. 757.
  "The people who had come from slavery with the uncleanly
and unhealthful habits which it engenders, were subjected to
the strictest training in the wilderness before entering Ca-
naan."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 277.
  For what other reason did God want the Israelites to be
healthy? Lev. 11:43-45; Ex. 19:6.

   Read Exodus 6:7, then consider the two prescriptions from
the Papyrus Ebers quoted in yesterday's lesson. Do you think
such medical advice could have been part of the "burdens"
("yoke," NIV) Exodus 6:7 mentions?

  Think about your personal health habits. Are some of them
burdens from which God is waiting to free you?

QUARANTINE IN EFFECT (Lev. 13:1-4, 36).
   God wanted the Israelites to be holy because He is holy. If
they were to be His people, they needed to reflect His character.
Thus He gave them a series of laws (yesterday's lesson) and His
grace to help them obey those laws (Lesson 1).
   While it's true that time changes the specific application of
certain Old Testament health laws, the principles of the laws
remain the same.
  What health principle do we find in Leviticus 13:1-4, 36?

   "The idea of quarantining those afflicted with contagious
diseases seems to have originated with the Hebrew people, a
safeguard given them by God Himself."—SDA Bible Commen-
tary, vol. 1, p. 763.
   "True leprosy." For the following reasons, it seems likely
that Leviticus 13 is describing skin diseases in general (includ-
ing leprosy): (1) The symptoms listed in Leviticus 13 are not the
symptoms of what we know to be leprosy. (2) Laws regarding
ceremonial cleansing infer that some people with "leprosy" got
well quickly. (3) "In a day when medical science as such did not
exist it would have been a difficult thing for the priests to give
a differential diagnosis of various diseases affecting the skin,
when they were in many respects similar, and for which there
were no specific names. Moses apparently grouped these re-
lated diseases under one general head, . . . which our English
versions have translated 'leprosy.' "—SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 1, p. 763.
  The Jews viewed leprosy as a symbol for sin (The Desire of
Ages, p. 262). How can we quarantine ourselves from sin? In
what ways should we quarantine ourselves from sinful peo-
ple? How is sin contagious? Can you provide a text in your
answers to these questions?

    "The plan of redemption contemplates our complete recov-
ery from the power of Satan. Christ always separates the con-
trite soul from sin."—The Desire of Ages, p. 311.



                                                               15
Tuesday                                          January 5
WHITED SEPULCHERS (Num. 19:11-19; Matt. 23:25-27).
   What other principle did God give the Israelites to ensure
their good health? Num. 19:11, 14, 16-19.
   Today, we almost take for granted that cleansing with water
hinders the spread of disease. But this was not always the case.
In Vienna, during the 1840s, Dr. Semmelweis became the direc-
tor of a hospital's obstetrics ward. "The first order of each
morning was . . . to perform autopsies on the unfortunate vic-
tims who had died during the preceding twenty-four hours.
Afterward, without cleansing their hands, the doctors . . .
marched into the maternity wards to make pelvic examinations
on the living women. Of course, no rubber gloves were
worn."—S. I. McMillen, M.D., None of These Diseases (Old
Tappan, N.J.: Fleming H. Revell Company, 1963), pp. 13, 14.
   After watching one out of every six of these patients die over
a period of three years, Dr. Semmelweis established a rule that
all doctors who performed an autopsy must wash their hands
before examining any living patients. Three months after this
rule went into effect, only one out of every 84 patients died.
   Long before the time Jesus began His public ministry,
the Jews had turned many of their laws into meaningless
ceremonies. Such was the case with the laws of purifica-
tion. Of what did the scribes and Pharisees accuse Jesus
and His disciples? Matt. 15:1, 2.

   We are not to assume that Jesus lived an unhealthful life-
style. The point He makes is this: We should never forget that
the focus of God's laws is Christ Himself. When we keep any
law simply because "it's tradition," we become hypocrites.
When we lose sight of why we do something, we become like
the "whited sepulchres" Jesus mentions in Matthew 23:27.
  After you read Matthew 23:25-27, think about why you
practice some of the biblical health guidelines advocated by
Seventh-day Adventists. For example, are you a vegetarian
because that's the way you grew up, or is it because you
want to be healthy so you can better fulfill God's plan for
your life?

GOD'S IDEAL (Gen. 1:26, 27; 2:20-24; Lev. 18:1-6, 20, 22).
   Part of God's instructions to the newly freed slaves in-
cluded His ideal for sexual relationships. Review this ideal in
Genesis 2:20-24, Matthew 19:3-6, and Hebrews 13:4.

   "As the Creator joined the hands of the holy pair in wed-
lock, saying, A man shall 'leave his father and his mother,
and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one' (Gen-
esis 2:24), He enunciated the law of marriage for all the chil-
dren of Adam to the close of time. That which the Eternal
Father Himself had pronounced good was the law of highest
blessing and development for man."—Thoughts From the
Mount of Blessing, pp. 63, 64.
   God's instructions to the Israelites in Leviticus 18 indicate
how far humankind had strayed from this ideal. Note espe-
cially verses 6, 20, 22, and 23.

   Part of the wretchedness that such practices cause include
both physical and emotional illness. The statistics concerning
the "newest" sexually transmitted disease are staggering. Be-
tween 1980 and the beginning of 1991, one large country in the
Western world reported a total of 152,326 cases of AIDS. It is
estimated that 70-85 percent of these cases were contracted
through sexual activity with infected persons. Such activity in-
cluded sex between homosexuals; women and bisexual men;
and heterosexuals and their multiple partners. In the same
country, some researchers estimate that the number of AIDS
cases doubles every 20-24 months.
   When engaged in such activity, each partner is exposed to all
the microorganisms of the partner's partners for the previous
five years.
   Read Revelation 17:2; 19:2, 7, 9; 21:2. Why did God cite the
marriage relationship to describe Christ's relationship to the
church? Why did He use the word fornication (a term that
refers to all unlawful acts of sex) to describe spiritual apos-
tasy?

TEMPLES OF GLORY (1 Cor. 6:19, 20; 10:31; 1 John 3:2, 3).

   When God led Israel out of Egypt, He told them how to be
healthy so they could better represent His character to the
world. So far this week we've looked at three examples of these
guidelines. Take a minute now to review them and to ask your-
self how they work in your life.
   The New Testament does not become as specific regarding
health regulations as the Old Testament. But certain verses pro-
vide general principles we can apply to modern life.

   As you read 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20 and 10:31, ask yourself
how the counsel in these verses could apply to health in gen-
eral and your health in particular.
    What does Christ's death (the "price" of 1 Cor. 6:20) do to
the value of a healthful lifestyle?
   What is "the glory of God" to which 1 Corinthians 10:31
refers?


   "When Moses asked the Lord to show him His glory, the
Lord said, 'I will make all my goodness pass before thee.' And
the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, The Lord, The
Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant
in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving
iniquity and transgression and sin. . . . And Moses made haste,
and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped.' Exodus
33:19; 34:6-8. When we are able to comprehend the character of
God, as did Moses, we too shall make haste to bow in adoration
and praise."—Counsels to Teachers, p. 30.
   We also might say that "when we are able to comprehend
the character of God, as did Moses," we shall "make haste" to
develop healthful lifestyles so we can better represent His char-
acter to the world!

  How can we apply 1 John 3:2, 3 to the area of health? How
do these verses relate to Leviticus 11:44, 45?


   As we desire to be more like Christ, we will allow the Holy
Spirit to purify us of anything that keeps us away from Him.
This would include any habit that dulls the senses, preventing
us from discerning His will.

Friday                                        January 8
FURTHER STUDY: Read the chapter "Hygiene Among the
Israelites" in The Ministry of Healing, pp. 277-286. Also read
1 Peter 2:9.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How has Christ "acquired the church"? As a member of
     the Christian church, how is your lifestyle representing
     Him? As a member of the church, do you personally feel
     that you are "His own purchased possession"?
  2. After studying this week's lesson, how would you re-
     spond to someone who says that parts of the Bible (such
     as the health regulations God gave to the Israelites) are
     unimportant and irrelevant to the modern world? To the
     person who excuses an unhealthful habit by rationalizing
     that the Bible doesn't specifically speak against it?
SUMMARY: When God freed Israel from slavery, part of His
instructions included health regulations. These laws, along
with general principles found in the New Testament, tell us
that health is an important aspect of religious life.

            Years Ago




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Isa. 58:12-14; Rev. 1:2;
19:10; 14:6-12.

     MEMORY TEXT: "And they that shall be of thee shall
     build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the founda-
     tions of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The
     repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in"
     (Isaiah 58:12).

  KEY THOUGHT: Just as God instructed the Israelites re-
garding health principles soon after their deliverance from
Egypt, so He instructed the new Adventist believers as they
embarked on their journey of faith and freedom.

    1863. It was a year that, to many, seems as dry and brittle as
the pages of their great-grandparents' family Bible. Yet 130
years ago the world was teeming with sorrow and joy just as it
is today. In America, Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves by sign-
ing the Emancipation Proclamation. In London, workers began
constructing the subway system, and laborers completed New
Zealand's first railroad, connecting Christchurch with Ferrymead.
    Also in 1863, a woman whose constitution was as frail as a
fading flower received a vision from God regarding health re-
form. This week, we will study the significance of that vision
given in a time when the world knew little and cared less about
God's health-promoting natural laws.

BUILDING THE WASTE PLACES (Rev. 14:6-12; Isa. 58:12-14).

   Ellen G. White's health vision is preceded by a rich biblical
heritage. Thousands of years earlier, God instructed the newly
freed Israelites regarding His health laws that had lain buried
under more than 100 years of slavery. Their robust health was
to be a beacon to surrounding idol-worshiping nations, urging
them to inquire about Israel's God. But the history of Israel's
failure regarding the fulfillment of their purpose is no secret.
Not until June 6, 1863, in a nation racked by civil war, would
God again make known in a special way His intentions regard-
ing health.

  What were two of the many texts Adventists based their
movement upon? Rev. 14:6-12; Isa. 58:12-14.


  The prophecies in these two passages describe a people
who keep the commandments of God. Considering lessons
one and two of this quarter, in what way can we say that these
commandments include God's natural laws?


   The messages of Revelation 14:6-12 and Isaiah 58:12-14 call
upon all to keep God's commandments. And without obedience
to God's commandments, no worship can be pleasing to God.
Obedience accompanies "the faith of Jesus." These messages
are timely, for, speaking of the last days, Isaiah writes: "The
earth lies polluted under its inhabitants; for they have trans-
gressed the laws, violated the statutes, broken the everlasting
covenant. Therefore a curse devours the earth, and its inhabi-
tants suffer for their guilt" (Isa. 24:5, 6, RSV).

   Healthwise, how does the earth lie polluted? In what ways
have earth's citizens transgressed God's health laws? What
curses are presently devouring the earth and its inhabitants as
a result of breaking these laws?


   Review this week's Memory Text. In what way can the
health-message portion of the gospel help to "build the old
waste places," "raise up the foundations of many genera-
tions," and repair the breach?


                                                              21

DAUGHTERS SHALL PROPHESY (Joel 2:28-32; Rev. 1:2;
19:10).

   The pioneers of the Advent movement referred to Joel 2:28-
32 to support their belief that God would gift the remnant
church with the Spirit of Prophecy. Pointing to verse 31, they
affirmed that this gift would reappear "before the great and
terrible day of the Lord come."

   How does the New Testament provide support for the
pioneers' belief regarding the Spirit of Prophecy? Rev. 1:2;
19:10; (see also 1 Cor. 1:4-8).


    It was against this backdrop that Ellen G. White received her
major vision regarding health on June 6, 1863. The vision came
less than two weeks after the first General Conference session
adjourned in Battle Creek, Michigan—a providential timing co-
inciding with the organization of the church into a general
body. Upon receipt of the vision, a united advance in temper-
ance and godliness could now be effected among the
Sabbathkeeping Adventists with the better organizational facil-
ities at hand to prosecute this new concept.

  As you read Ellen White's report of the vision, notice the
twofold duty God's message gave to the church.


   "I saw that it was a sacred duty to attend to our health, and
arouse others to their duty. . . . We have a duty to speak, to
come out against intemperance of every kind—intemperance in
working, in eating, in drinking, and in drugging [using medica-
tions]—and then point them to God's great medicine, water,
pure soft water, for diseases, for health, for cleanliness, and for
a luxury. . . . I saw that we should not be silent upon the subject
of health but should wake up minds to the subject."
   "It is not safe nor pleasing to God to violate the laws of
health and then ask Him to take care of our health and keep us
from disease when we are living directly contrary to our pray-
ers."—Selected Messages, book 3, p. 280.

  Has the passing of 130 years removed or intensified our
obligation to live healthfully and to share health information
with the world? Why?

THE LARGE SCOPE (1 Cor. 3:16, 17).
   Arthur L. White, one of Ellen White's grandchildren, wrote
with considerable insight about the large scope of Ellen
White's 1863 health vision. As you read his words below, un-
derline the different aspects the vision involved.
   "Mankind suffered as, turning from God's plan, they
made flesh food a part of the diet. Intemperance in eating
and in drinking and the indulgence of base passions had
benumbed the fine sensibilities, while the use of intoxicating
beverages had beclouded men's reasoning faculties. Tobacco
in whatever form it was used, was a slow poison; tea and
coffee were stimulating, with effects similar to those of to-
bacco. In harmony with morbid appetite, rich desserts and
every hurtful thing had been crowded into the stomach,
bringing pain and various ills. Such appetite was to be de-
nied, and they were to eat sparingly of food that was health-
ful. The use of swine's flesh had ever been forbidden and
hurtful, and there were other animals that God had forbid-
den man to eat. Children had been led by their parents to eat
improperly and had suffered greatly. Drug taking was bane-
ful, resulting in more deaths than all other causes com-
bined—strychnine, opium, mercury, and quinine were specif-
ically named as having destroyed millions. In sickness, nature
was to be aided by the common blessings of pure air, pure
water, and a simple diet. These would result in a speedy and
safe cure. Water was especially beneficial, but many had
never experienced its helpful effects. Multitudes remained in
inexcusable ignorance, wondering why the race was feeble
and life short. There were many who had neglected personal
cleanliness. . . . Houses were to be built with the value of
sunlight taken into account. Rooms, especially those slept in,
should be well ventilated. Healthful dress was an important
 factor. A diseased body affects the brain. Satan triumphs in
 the ruinous work of causing members of the human family
 to destroy themselves through wrong habits."—Review and
 Herald, June 6, 1968, pp. 3, 4; adapted.
   Now organize below what you have underlined into a list
of "do's." If you haven't already done so, how can you incor-
porate these into your life?

MAKING A DIFFERENCE (3 John 2).

   The obituaries in the Review and Herald for 1862 report 63
deaths. Eighteen were children under 7 years old. Nine were
between the ages of 7 and 20, while 14 were between 21 and 40.
Fourteen were 60, while only eight grew any older.
   These figures suggest that the health of Adventists before
1863 was generally unfavorable. Imagine yourself as one of
them as you continue reading.
   Annie Smith, Uriah's sister, died when she was 27. Nathaniel
and Anna, James White's brother and sister, died at the ages of
21 and 26, respectively, one in 1853 and the other in 1854. Rob-
ert Harmon, Ellen White's brother, passed away at the age of
27. If, in the winter of 1853 to 1854, God had not relieved Ellen
White of a serious heart condition and a threatening cancer of
the eye, she would have died when she was 27.
   "Our forefathers, giving but little attention to health, took the
situation in stride. Little known to them at that time was the
fact that health was close to religion, and that God, who was
leading a people who were preparing to meet their Lord
through the means of His choice, was about to lead His people
into a new and helpful experience."—Arthur L. White, Review
and Herald, June 6, 1968, p. 2.

   By the time Ellen White received the 1863 health vision, most
of the principal "messengers" or preachers of the Advent
movement were lying on their backs, the victims of exhaustion
or dyspepsia (indigestion). Even she had struggled back to
health from three strokes. How great was the need for such a
vision!

  What about today's world and church shows there is a need
for more knowledge regarding health? Is there evidence to
suggest improvement in certain areas?


   What does it tell us about God that He providentially re-
lieved Mrs. White of physical afflictions before He gave her
the health vision? Does God miraculously heal the sick while
they are disobeying known health principles?

FULFILLING THE VISION (1 Cor. 9:25).
    How quickly did the church organization accept the princi-
ples outlined in the 1863 health vision? Read what Mrs. White
wrote about it: "In the vision given me in Rochester, New York,
December 25, 1865, I was shown that our Sabbathkeeping peo-
ple have been negligent in acting upon the light which God has
given in regard to the health reform, that there is yet a great
work before us. . . .
    "I was shown that we should provide a home for the af-
flicted and those who wish to learn how to take care of their
bodies that they may prevent sickness."—Testimonies, vol. 1, pp.
485, 489.
    Because of this, the fourth annual meeting of the General
Conference in 1866 passed the following resolution: "Resolved,
That we acknowledge the health reform as set forth in the testi-
mony of Sister White, as part of the work of God incumbent on
us at this time; and that we pledge ourselves to live in accord-
ance with these principles, and that we will use our best en-
deavors to impress their importance upon others."—Review and
Herald, May 22, 1866.
    The church's first health paper, The Health Reformer, also ap-
peared in 1866 as did the first "sanitarium," The Western
Health Reform Institute in Battle Creek.
    Looking back in 1901, Ellen White wrote, "In the light given
me so long ago (1863), I was shown that intemperance would
prevail in the world to an alarming extent, and that every one of
the people of God must take an elevated stand in regard to
reformation in habits and practices. . . . The Lord presented a
general plan before me. I was shown that God would give to
His commandment-keeping people a reform diet, and that as
they received this, their disease and suffering would be greatly
lessened. I was shown that this work would progress."—Coun-
sels on Diet and Foods, pp. 481, 482. And progress it did. Pres-
ently, the church operates approximately 167 hospitals and
sanitariums, 17 food companies, and 340 dispensaries and clin-
 ics.
    The Advent movement brought about a restoration of the
 great truths of Scripture, thus pioneering a reform movement
aimed at the restoration of humanity's health.
   Is there something about your health habits that you'd like
to change in order to fulfill this vision on a more personal
level? Next week's lesson will tell you how.

                                                               25

FURTHER STUDY: As you read Isaiah 58:6-10, think about
how the church's health message is part of letting "the op-
pressed go free" (verse 6) and "satisfying the afflicted soul"
(verse 10). If available, read Testimonies, vol. 1, "The Health Re-
form," pp. 485-495, and "The Health Institute," pp. 633-643.
   "Several research reports support the concept that personal
health practices (lifestyle) profoundly affect one's health. One of
the landmark studies in the area of health practices and mortal-
ity was conducted by Belloc and Breslow at the Human Popula-
tion Laboratory. In a 12-year follow-up study of nearly 7,000
individuals, Drs. Lester Breslow and James Emstrom examined
such health practices as not smoking, exercising, little or no
drinking, eating breakfast, not snacking, not being overweight,
and sleeping seven to nine hours per day, and their relationship
to death. They reported that men who followed three or fewer
of these seven favorable health practices had a mortality rate
that was nearly four times higher than that of men who fol-
lowed all seven. For women the comparable rate was more than
twice as high."—Ministry, "Why Adventists Live Longer," by
Jan Kuzma, September, 1989, pp. 25, 26. Thus, the passing of
many years verifies the truth of the Spirit of Prophecy.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. In relating her health visions, Ellen White used the phrase
     "I was shown" to let us know that God had given her the
     ensuing counsel. How does it make you feel to know that
     God communicated to us in such a way? What does it tell
     us about His character?
     2. Adventists believe that they have been called by God to
        keep His holy law and to give the last warning message to
        the world. Is this the result of: (1) private interpretation of
        Scripture? (2) pride? (3) bigotry? (4) divine providence? (5)
        the actual demands of Bible prophecy?
SUMMARY: Lessons 1-3 tell us why God's health message is
important. Because it is an integral part of His plan for our
happiness, He gave to the remnant church, as He did to Israel,
special instructions regarding His health laws.

Lesson 4                                     January 17-23

          Making Changes




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Psalms 139:23, 24; 73:24;
Mark 5:2, 13, 19; Gal. 6:7; Eph. 2:10; James 4:6-10; 1 John 3:22.
  MEMORY TEXT: "I can do all things through Christ
  which strengtheneth me" (Philippians 4:13).
  KEY THOUGHT: Because God's blessings for us include
health, He will give us the power to do those things which will
help us to be healthier. He will also give us the strength to break
habits that make us ill.
   THE NEXT STEP. So far this quarter we have seen (1) that
the plan of salvation includes health reform, and (2) that the
Bible and the Spirit of Prophecy give us a broad platform on
which to base our health consciousness.
   But what if you're trapped in a habit you know is making
you sick? What if you want to stop overeating or drinking cof-
fee, but just can't?
   Not being able to do what we should has been a dilemma
plaguing humankind since the beginning of sin on this planet.
   Read how Paul felt about this problem in Romans 7:18, 19,
24. What was his solution? Read the first half of verse 25.
   This week's lesson should provide you with insights on how
to change unhealthful behavior. Then you can apply these in-
sights to your life as you study the rest of the quarterly.

                                                                27
Sunday                                          January 17
IDENTIFY! (Ps. 139:23, 24; Lam. 3:40; Matt. 5:4).
   The most important thing to remember about changing our
behavior is that we can't do it by ourselves! (Rom. 7:18, 19). In-
stead, Christ helps us break the spell bad habits hold over us.

   At what point in our lives is Christ able to do this for us?
Ps. 139:23, 24; Lam. 3:40; Matt. 5:4.


  When we are serious about asking God to help us examine
our lives, He will help us identify what behavior we should
change and give us the strength to do so.

   "Blessed are they that mourn." "The mourning here
brought to view is true heart sorrow for sin."—Thoughts From
the Mount of Blessing, p. 9.
   An essential ingredient. Notice that Psalm 139:23, 24 is a
prayer. Regardless of which bad habits we are trying to change,
prayer is essential in helping us understand their seriousness.
Because they are health-destroying, and therefore contrary to
God's plan for our lives, we need to confess such habits to Him
and ask Him for guidance in establishing health-promoting be-
havior.

   "To those who desire prayer for their restoration to health, it
should be made plain that the violation of God's law, either
natural or spiritual, is sin, and that in order for them to receive
His blessing, sin must be confessed and forsaken."—The Minis-
try of Healing, p. 228.

   As you reread Psalm 139:23, 24, notice that it is a prayer of
self-examination. Make it your prayer as you seek to develop
a more healthful lifestyle.


   Here is a strategy to help you understand any problem area
the Lord may point out to you: Keep a diary for one week of the
habit you want to change. For example, if you're eating too
much, keep a record of everything you eat or drink, the times
you eat or drink, and your feelings at the time (hunger, ner-
vousness, etc.). Over a period of days a pattern may emerge,
helping you to better understand the problem. The better you
understand the problem, the easier it will be to allow God to
change your behavior.

Monday                                         January 18
EXPLORE! (Gal. 6:7; Isa. 30:21).

   What are the physical, mental, and spiritual consequences
of a habit, good or bad? Gal. 5:19-24; 6:7, 8; Rom. 8:12-15.


   Do you exercise for 20 minutes three or four times a week?
Then you probably stay alert for longer periods of time. Do you
drink caffeinated beverages? Then you are apt to be nervous
and edgy. Whatever kind of habit you're sowing, you'll reap
the consequences of its accumulative effect.
   Review Psalm 139:23, 24. As you become aware of your prob-
lem, it's helpful to think about its consequences.
   Take stress, for example. We're all exposed to it, and each of
us needs a certain amount of managed stress. But suppose you
aren't managing it. You might experience tightening of the
muscles, upset stomach, ulcers, maybe even a heart attack or
stroke. When we recognize such symptoms as the result of ill-
managed stress, we can look for ways to change our attitudes
toward the things that cause stress. If possible, we can also find
ways to reduce stress or call on available resources to help us
manage what we cannot handle alone.

   As you search for possible solutions to any unhealthful
habit, what promises will be helpful for you to claim? Ps. 32:8;
37:5; Isa. 30:21.


   A calm feeling of assurance comes over us as we realize that
God is in control. Knowing this, we are better able to find ways
of changing unhealthful behavior.

  Here is a practical idea to help you change an injurious habit:
  Write the desired change you want to make. For example,
"After examining several alternatives and the consequences of
each alternative, I have decided to be temperate in my choice of
desserts. I will choose fruit instead of sugary sweets. I admit to
God and, if appropriate, to my family and friends that I need
God's power in my life to act on this decision."




                                                                29
Tuesday                                       January 19
DEVELOP! (Eph. 2:10; Ps. 73:24; Dan. 9:3, 4; 1 John 3:22).
  Once God has convinced you that you need to change a
habit, and once you've explored possible solutions, it's time to
develop a realistic plan that will help you reach your goal in
small steps. If you fail to plan, you'll plan to fail.
  What guidelines should you consider in developing a plan?
Eph. 2:10; Ps. 73:24.

   "Success is not the result of chance or of destiny; it is the
outworking of God's own providence, the reward of faith and
discretion, of virtue and persevering effort."—Christ's Object
Lessons, p. 353.
   How does Daniel's prayer teach us about God's plan and
the need to change? Dan. 9:3, 4, 17, 19.

   Change rarely takes place unless one is discontented with
those things preventing it. No one makes plans or prays when
satisfied with the status quo.
   Are you willing to make such a commitment in order to
form more healthful habits? Is Daniel's prayer your own?

  What part do you have to play in the fulfillment of such a
determined petition? 1 John 3:22; James 1:6, 7; Matt. 21:22.

   The following is an example of a realistic plan for reaching a
goal in small steps:
   To reduce high blood pressure, reduce salt intake. The even-
tual goal is to reduce sodium intake to one teaspoon per day.
Begin by cutting the content of salt in recipes by one fourth for
a week or two, and then by one half, until finally you reach
your goal. Without a definite plan, your salt intake may con-
tinue to increase.
  Are there some habits that a person can, or should, break
immediately, without gradual withdrawal?


30
Wednesday                                      January 20
ACT! (James 2:26; Eph. 4:22-24).
  God has convinced you that you need to change certain
habits in order to be healthier. With His guidance you've exam-
ined possible solutions and developed a realistic plan. Now
you're ready to act.
   What is the relationship between faith and action? James
2:26. In Hebrews 11, notice how many action words the author
used. What does this tell us about faith and works?

   True faith is always willing to cooperate with God's plan for
restoration.
   "There was nothing dead about either Abraham's or Rahab's
faith or that of any of the other heroes of faith honored in Heb.
11. By faith they obeyed. Church members in name only, with-
out a personal witness that reflects the ministry of Christ on
their behalf, are, as it were, mere corpses."—SDA Bible Commen-
tary, vol. 7, p. 524.
  Describe the change that takes place when a person forms
better habits. Eph. 4:22-24.

   "The Christian's life is not a modification or improvement of
the old, but a transformation of nature. . . . When the Spirit of
God takes possession of the heart, it transforms the life."—The
Desire of Ages, pp. 172, 173.
   New habits are more quickly and firmly established when
physical and mental action are involved. For example, gym-
nasts not only spend several hours physically practicing, they
also mentally practice their actions.
   What if a person tends to explode verbally when someone
wrongs him or her? That person can practice remaining calm in
actual situations. But he or she can also practice a response in
advance by thinking, When this happens again, I will pray, Lord,
You love this person as much as You love me. Help me not to let
[person's name] control me. Help me to remain calm and gentle.
   How do Isaiah 26:3 and Philippians 4:8 illustrate this prin-
ciple?


                                                               31
Thursday                                         January 21
RESIST AND SHARE! (Ps. 139:23, 24; Gal. 6:7; James 4:6-10;
1 John 3:22).
   Once you've acted on a plan to help change a habit, don't
become discouraged if you should meet with temporary set-
backs. Such changes require time. And Satan is never happy
when we decide to give up something that has the potential for
separating us from God. These suggestions will help you meet
the arrows the enemy will point in your direction:
   1.Avoid situations you know will be tempting.
   2. Prepare an action plan to meet temptations when they
arrive.
   3. Practice your responses.
   4. Don't hesitate to resist temptation. Delaying makes it more
difficult to resist.
   5. Remember that with Christ's help you can succeed.
   6. When appropriate, share with others how the Lord has
helped you.
  How can this last suggestion help you in establishing a
more healthful lifestyle?

    "The relation which exists between the mind and the body is
very intimate. . . . The condition of the mind affects the health of
the physical system. If the mind is free and happy, from a con-
sciousness of rightdoing and a sense of satisfaction in causing
happiness to others, it creates a cheerfulness that will react
upon the whole system, causing a freer circulation of the blood
and a toning up of the entire body. The blessing of God is a
healing power, and those who are abundant in benefiting
others will realize that wondrous blessing in both heart and
life."—Counsels on Health, p. 28.
  "We become overcomers by helping others to overcome,
by the blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony."
—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 974.
   What did Jesus instruct a demoniac to do after He healed
him? Mark 5:2, 13, 19. How can you tell others about the effect
of Christ's healing powers in your life? Is it always necessary
to tell someone verbally?



32
Friday                                         January 22
FURTHER STUDY: Changing any habit requires that we de-
pend upon God's power. Read about His power in Genesis
18:14 (first half), 2 Chronicles 25:8, Isaiah 40:29, and Jeremiah
32:17. Also read the chapter "A Higher Experience," pages
503-516, in The Ministry of Healing.
   "Those who put their trust in Christ are not to be enslaved
by any hereditary or cultivated habit or tendency. Instead of
being held in bondage to the lower nature, they are to rule
every appetite and passion. God has not left us to battle with
evil in our own finite strength. Whatever may be our inherited
or cultivated tendencies to wrong, we can overcome through
the power that He is ready to impart."—The Ministry of Healing,
pp. 175, 176.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How is David's prayer in Psalm 139:23, 24 a prayer of
     confession and repentance? What is "the way everlast-
     ing," and how does it relate to a healthful lifestyle?

  2. Do you think some persons exercise proper health habits
     as a way to earn salvation? According to Lesson 1, what is
     the real reason for adopting a healthful lifestyle?

   3. Consider Paul's life. What habits did he need to change
      and how did he change them? How can we apply his
      experience to ours when it comes to changing habits?
      What does his experience tell us about the process of
      changing?

   4. After studying this week's lesson, what habit do you think
      God wants you to change? Will you ask Him now to help
      you do so?

SUMMARY: In the space below, outline the steps necessary in
breaking a bad habit. (If you have identified a habit in Discus-
sion Question 4, make your outline with that habit in mind.
You might also want to outline a plan to help break that habit.)
   Remember these steps as you study the rest of the quarterly.
They will help you apply the lessons so you can have a health-
ier, happier life.

              True Remedies




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Gen. 1; 2:15; Mark 6:31.
     MEMORY TEXT: "I will praise thee; for I am fearfully
     and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that
     my soul knoweth right well" (Psalm 139:14).
   KEY THOUGHT. "Pure air, sunlight, abstemiousness, rest,
exercise, proper diet, the use of water, trust in divine power—
these are the true remedies. Every person should have a knowl-
edge of nature's remedial agencies and how to apply
them."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 127.
   AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION . . . Can you finish this old
saying? It goes like this: An ounce of prevention is worth a
pound of cure. This is especially true when applied to health. It
makes so much more sense to know how to prevent disease
than to know how to treat it when you get sick. Yet how many
of us know about and practice nature's inexpensive remedies?
   This lesson begins a six-week study that will explore nature's
eight basic principles governing our health. Violation of these
principles will inevitably increase the risk of illness, disability,
and premature death. Following them will do more to enhance
our health and our Christian experience than modern medicine,
medical advances, national insurance programs, and the best-
equipped hospitals in the world!

THE FACE OF THE DEEP (Gen. 1).
   During Creation Week, God provided for many of the ways
nature keeps us healthy. Search through Genesis 1 and 2 to
see whether you can pick them out. What is the first one men-
tioned?

   Water has existed since the beginning of Creation and is an
important factor in keeping our bodies running smoothly:
   1.By weight the body is about 70 percent water.
   2. Blood is approximately 83 percent water, and bones con-
sist of nearly 22 percent water.
   3. Water comprises approximately 75 percent of the body's
muscles.
    4. The body requires about two and one half quarts (2.4 li-
ters) of water per day to perform all of its functions. Some of
these functions include blood circulation, waste removal, nutri-
ent transport, and digestion. (We obtain water both by drinking
it and from the food we eat.)
    5. The average person has between 15 and 40 billion brain
cells. Each one of those is 70 to 85 percent water. Sufficient
water to supply these cells helps keep you mentally alert and
helps prevent depression and irritability.
    6. It is not only the water you drink that is important. A cool
or tepid daily bath or shower improves circulation, thus ener-
gizing the body and mind. A shower or bath can also soothe
 jangled nerves, which can cause illness by weakening the im-
mune system. Bathing also removes impurities from the skin
and can reduce fever.
   What does water symbolize in the Bible? John 4:5-14;
7:37, 38.

   "Refreshing water . . . is an emblem of the divine grace which
Christ alone can bestow, and which is as the living water, puri-
fying, refreshing, and invigorating the soul. He in whom Christ
is abiding has within him a never-failing fountain of grace and
strength."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 412.
   How has Jesus refreshed your soul lately?



                                                                35
Monday                                             January 25
FIRST THINGS FIRST (Gen. 1:3-5).

   Day 1. "Without light there could be no life; and as the Crea-
tor began the work of bringing order from chaos and of intro-
ducing various forms of plant and animal life upon the earth, it
was essential that there be light."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol.
1, pp. 209, 210.
   The benefits of sunlight are many:
   1. Fifteen to 30 minutes of daily exposure to sunlight in the
early morning or late afternoon helps the body synthesize or
make its own vitamin D, an essential nutrient/hormone in the
skin. (Vitamin D helps blood to produce calcium and phospho-
rus, which build and repair bone mass.)
   2. Sunlight acts as a disinfectant and a killer of bacteria and
germs.
   3. Being in the sun after a plane trip that crosses several time
zones is helpful in adjusting to jet lag.
   4. The sun "provides energy to convert carbon dioxide and
water into carbohydrates by the plant kingdom. Without this
process animals and humans would starve to death."—Eleanor
N. Whitney and Eva M. Hamilton, Understanding Nutrition (St.
Paul, Minn.: West Publishing Company, 1981), p. 401.
   5. Sunlight also helps a person adjust to night work and re-
lieves depression related to dark days where winter occurs.
   (A word of caution: Sunlight can also be harmful. Prolonged
exposure can burn skin, increase the risk of skin cancer, speed
up the aging process, damage the eyes, and cause cataracts.)

   Light as a symbol. In the Bible light is a symbol of God's
presence (Ps. 18:28; 112:4; Isa. 60:1; John 1:4-9). Just as physical
light is essential to physical life, so spiritual light is essential to
moral and spiritual life. Read 1 John 1:5. "To those in whose
hearts the work of recreating the divine likeness is going on
apace, He comes again today bidding the shadows of sin, un-
certainty, and discouragement flee, saying, 'Let there be
light.' "—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 210.

   How can you add more sunlight, both physical and spir-
itual, to your life? How can the Son's light protect your im-
mune system from the germs and bacteria of sin?

Tuesday                                         January 26
TAKE A DEEP BREATH! (Gen. 1:7, 8).
  What else besides water and sunlight did God create to
keep our bodies finely tuned? Gen. 1:7, 8.

   Heaven. "In this verse [verse 8] 'heaven' refers to the atmos-
pheric heavens that appear . . . as a canopy . . . vaulting our
earth."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 211.
   No one can live longer than five or six minutes without
using some of the heaven mentioned in Genesis 1:7, 8. "In order
to have good blood, we must breathe well. Full, deep inspira-
tions of pure air, which fill the lungs with oxygen, purify the
blood. They impart to it a bright color, and send it, a life-giving
current, to every part of the body."—The Ministry of Healing,
p. 272.
   No problem here, you may think. We breathe naturally! But we
don't naturally breathe the way we should. Have you ever seen
a baby's abdomen expand like a balloon with each breath and
flatten while breathing out? Then you've seen the correct way
to breathe. You can learn to breathe like a baby again by doing
the following:
   Sit in a straight-backed chair and slide forward a few inches.
Place the palm of one hand over your navel, and place the other
hand on top of it. If your abdomen flattens as you inhale, you
are breathing incorrectly.
   To practice breathing correctly, take a deep breath and exhale
completely through your mouth. Notice how your abdomen
naturally flattens, then flatten it even farther. Now let the next
breath flow naturally through your nose. If your abdomen ex-
pands like a balloon, you're breathing properly.
   What kind of air you breathe is also important. Buildings
should allow for proper circulation. And sleep with the win-
dow open, safety and weather permitting.
   This lesson emphasizes how dependent we are on air for
life. Compare this dependence with our dependence on Christ
for salvation.

  Practice spiritual breathing as you exhale the bad air by
confessing and submitting sin and weakness to Jesus. Inhale
the heavenly atmosphere by receiving Jesus through pardon
and cleansing. (See John 20:21, 22; Rom. 8:11.)

                                                                37
Wednesday                                      January 27
LET'S GET MOVING! (Gen. 2:15).
   God appointed Adam and Eve to do work that involved ex-
ercising the body. Unfortunately, many of us today have work
that involves a minimal amount of movement. Yet the fact that
exercise is vital to our health has not changed. Here are only
some of the things it can do for us:
   1.Exercise helps to normalize blood pressure.
   2. Exercise allows more blood to reach all parts of the body,
keeping the extremities warm.
   3. Exercise releases both physical and emotional tension,
helping you to feel better about life.
   4. Exercise provides electrical energy to the brain and nerve
cells.
   5. It can help with your complexion and keep you trim.
   6. Exercise makes you more energetic, thus delaying both
physical and emotional fatigue.
   7. It aids in the brain's production of a chemical that gives
you a sense of well-being and increases your tolerance for pain.
   This partial list should convince us that it is time to stop
making excuses and start exercising. Start slowly and gradually
increase as you gain endurance. It may be wise to consult your
physician before starting. High blood pressure and cholesterol
often do not manifest symptoms, but can prove harmful when
starting an exercise program. Your goal should be to engage in
any type of aerobic exercise or recreation that is comparable to
walking one mile in 15 minutes four or more times a week.
(Aerobic exercises repeatedly use the large muscles of the legs
and arms until the heart rate increases 20 to 25 percent.)
   Better than medicine. "Those whose habits are sedentary
should, when the weather will permit, exercise in the open air
every day, summer or winter. Walking is preferable . . . for it
brings more of the muscles into exercise. The lungs are forced
into healthy action, since it is impossible to walk briskly with-
out inflating them.
   "Such exercise would in many cases be better for the health
than medicine."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 240.
  What modern conveniences rob us of the opportunity to
exercise? How can you exercise despite these conveniences?

"COME YE . . . APART" (Gen. 2:2, 3; Mark 6:31).
   What other types of rest besides the Sabbath rest are neces-
sary?

   "I was shown that Sabbathkeepers as a people labor too
hard, without allowing themselves change or periods of rest.
Recreation is needful to those who are engaged in physical
labor, and is still more essential for those whose labor is princi-
pally mental."—Counsels on Health, p. 195.
   Rest helps us work more efficiently and think more clearly. It
also helps the body fight infections and contributes to a longer
life. There are three types of rest: (1) rest from emotional or
mental stress, (2) rest from physical exertion, and (3) rest from
an illness or injury. If you spend too much time thinking or
worrying, you may experience anxiety, depression, or irritabil-
ity. "Rest" from this is to exercise in the fresh air. To rest from
physical exertion, know your body's limit, then quit before you
become exhausted. And finally, illness or injury require bed rest
to provide healing to the body.
   To sleep well, follow these tips: Choose regular hours to
sleep. Use a comfortable bed. And if possible, allow plenty of
fresh air in the bedroom, and keep the room around 60 degrees
F (16 degrees C). Also keep physically fit. Relax prior to bed-
time. And if you eat an evening meal, make it light and at least
4 hours before retiring.
  How can the Sabbath help with the first two types of rest
mentioned above?

  True Sabbathkeeping also involves learning more about God
and ministering to the spiritual needs of others.
  Of what special rest was the Sabbath designed to remind
us? Ex. 31:13; Heb. 4:1, 3, 10, 11. How can this rest help us to be
physically healthier?

  Hebrews 4:1, 3, 10, 11 "refer to the Christian's rest from the
works of sin and from attempts to earn salvation by his own
merits."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 414.

FURTHER STUDY: In light of what you studied this week,
meditate upon Psalms 33:5; 51:7; and Ecclesiastes 11:7. Read
also "The Smitten Rock" in Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 411-413
(water), and The Ministry of Healing, pp. 127, 220, 275 (sun-
light); 274 (air); 127, 237-239, 265, 293 (exercise); 127, 236 (rest).
   "Great blessings are enfolded in the observance of the Sab-
bath, and God desires that the Sabbath day shall be to us a day
of joy. There was joy at the institution of the Sabbath. God
looked with satisfaction upon the work of His hands. All things
that he had made He pronounced 'very good.' . . . Though sin
has entered the world to mar His perfect work, God still gives
to us the Sabbath as a witness that One omnipotent, infinite in
goodness and mercy, created all things. Our heavenly Father
desires through the observance of the Sabbath to preserve
among men a knowledge of Himself. He desires that the Sab-
bath shall direct our minds to Him as the true and living God,
and that through knowing Him we may have life and peace."
—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 349.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Make a list of the most important lessons you have
     learned about good health and its relationship to water,
     fresh air, sunlight, exercise, and rest. Given what you've
     learned about these principles, how can they help you at-
     tain a more rewarding spiritual life? (Reviewing Lesson 1
     may help you answer this question.)
     2. Which natural remedy studied this week do you need
        more of? Use the techniques described in Lesson 4 to dis-
        cover where you need improvement and to implement a
        plan to help create a change in your lifestyle.
     3. Have you noticed how the natural laws studied this week
        relate to one another in terms of function? Review the
        Memory Text with this in mind. What do these principles
        tell us about God and the way He views us?
     4. How will the use of these natural laws help spread the
        gospel message?
SUMMARY: God has given us natural laws to help maintain
our health so we can more easily learn about and work for
Him. These principles work together to promote a state of
well-being that will attract others to the gospel message.

              Body Building




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Gen. 1:29; 3:18; Dan. 1:1-
20.

  MEMORY TEXT: "Bless the Lord, 0 my soul, and forget
  not all his benefits: . . . Who satisfieth thy mouth with
  good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's"
  (Psalm 103:2, 5).

   KEY THOUGHT: "Each organ of the body requires its share
of nutrition. . . . "Those foods should be chosen that best supply
the elements needed for building up the body."—The Ministry
of Healing, p. 295.

   FOOD FOR LIFE. Last week we began looking at the natu-
ral powers God supplies to help us with our health. This
week we'll discuss another natural remedy—diet. Food helps
to form all bodily tissues and cells and provides energy. And
finally, we enjoy food so much. It tastes, smells, and looks
delicious. Even many social events revolve around a carefully
prepared meal.
   The importance of food is illustrated by your experience. Cal-
culate the amount of time you spend doing the following during
a given week: shopping for food (include travel time to and from
the store or restaurant), preparing meals, eating, cleaning up after
meals, etc. Divide that figure by 168 hours (one week's time) and
you will have the percentage of a week's time spent with food.

   How has food added enjoyment (or sorrow) to your life?
                                                                 41
Sunday                                         January 31
DIVINE DIET (Gen. 1:29; 3:18).
 What did God originally intend for us to eat? Gen. 1:29.
What did He add after the Fall? Gen. 3:18.

  Before they sinned, Adam and Eve ate fruits, seeds, grains,
and nuts. These foods are without animal fat and cholesterol,
which increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, hypertension,
and certain cancers.
  This diet was also high in vitamins A and C. It appears that
foods containing these nutrients lower the risk of a variety of
cancers.
  Even the herbs (vegetables) God allowed for food after the
Fall have advantages. Cabbage and beans, for example, contain
substances that reduce the risk of colon cancer.
  When did God finally give His consent for people to eat
meat, and why? Gen. 9:1-3.

   What restrictions did God place on eating meat? Gen. 7:2.
As you read Leviticus 11, make note of items that are familiar
to you and anything you may not have heard of before. What
do verses 23-25, 29-39, tell us about the relationship of diet to
our spiritual health?

  Think about it: Why does it make sense now more than
ever to return to God's original diet (if the preferred foods are
readily available)?

   Food for thought. According to the Loma Linda Adventist
Health Study, 40-year-old male vegetarians (those who ate no
meat or who ate it less than once a month) can expect to outlive
male nonvegetarians by 3.7 years. The figure for women is 1.1
years. An Adventist nonvegetarian man in his forties has a
heart attack risk four times greater than his vegetarian counter-
part. The death rate from all causes combined for men and
women was 33 percent greater for nonvegetarians than it was
for vegetarians. Cancer death rates are 51 percent greater for
prostate cancer and 66 percent greater for ovarian cancer
among nonvegetarians.

A TEST CASE (Dan. 1:1-20).

   Yesterday's lesson cited modem statistics favoring a veg-
etarian diet. What incident occurred between 606 and 605 B.C.
that supports these findings? Dan. 1:1-20.


   The king's meat. "Among the viands [foods] placed before
the king were swine's flesh and other meats which were de-
clared unclean."—The Sanctified Life, p. 19.

   Pulse (verse 12). " 'Food derived from plants,' such as ce-
reals and vegetables. According to Jewish tradition, berries and
dates were also comprehended in the term."—SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 4, p. 761.

   Without equal. "At the court of Babylon were gathered rep-
resentatives from all lands, men . . . possessed of the broadest
culture that the world could bestow; yet among them all, the
Hebrew youth were without a peer. In physical strength and
beauty, in mental vigor and literary attainment, they stood un-
rivaled. The erect form, the firm, elastic step, the fair counte-
nance, the undimmed senses, the untainted breath—all were so
many certificates of good habits, insignia of the nobility with which
nature honors those who are obedient to her laws."—Prophets and
Kings, p. 485 (italics supplied).

  What lesson in changing any health habit does Daniel's
experience teach us?


  Through His Holy Spirit, God will strengthen us to follow
His plans for our health and happiness.

   Daniel's test case was not so much over the benefits of
vegetarianism as it was over his loyalty to God. What does
this tell us about the importance of what we eat as it relates to
our experience with the Lord?


  What does Daniel's test case show us about meeting health
concerns in an evangelistic approach? Is there a way you can
personally witness to a friend by using this method?


                                                                  43
Tuesday                                          February 2
ATTENTION, VEGETARIANS!

   Maybe we don't eat meat. But with the availability of so
much "ready-to-eat" food, we need to remind ourselves of
some things about the original diet that our modem life often
leads us to forget.

   How did Adam and Eve obtain their food? Gen. 2:15, 16;
3:17, 18.


   Even today, there are steps we can take to ensure a healthful
diet.
   1. Purchase the freshest and best-quality fruits, nuts, grains,
and vegetables available. Then store them in a cool, dry place
for a short amount of time.
   2. Eat some raw food every day. When you do cook, use a
minimum amount of water and time.
   3. Stay away from as many refined foods as possible. Buy or
make breads with whole-grain cereal flour, and use brown rice
instead of white. Your intake of such starches and complex car-
bohydrates should consist of six or more servings a day. (This
also includes seeds and legumes.)
   4. Try to eat five or more servings (one half cup) of fruits and
vegetables every day. Green and yellow vegetables, along with
citrus fruits, are especially important. Also try to eat plenty of
fresh fruits and vegetables as they come into their season.
   5. Replace your intake of animal fats (butter, cream, lard,
suet, etc.) with vegetable fats. Your total fat intake should not
be more than one third of your total calories.
   All red meats and dairy products are high in saturated ani-
mal fats and cholesterol. Both saturated fats and cholesterol in-
crease the risk of heart disease, cancer, stroke, obesity, and
diabetes.

  List the foods you ate yesterday. How does your list com-
pare with the above recommendations?


   "In planning vegetarian diets of any type one should choose
a wide variety of foods which may include fruits, vegetables,
whole grain products, nuts, seeds, legumes, lowfat dairy prod-
ucts, or fortified soy substitutes."—American Dietetic Association
Reports, March 1988, pp. 352, 354.

Wednesday                                      February 3
IT'S NOT JUST WHAT YOU EAT

  So far this week we've studied about what to eat. But know-
ing how to eat is just as important.

  What advice do we find in Ecclesiastes 10:17? What do the
phrases "eat in due season," "for strength," and "not for
drunkenness" imply?


   In due season. "At the proper time."—SDA Bible Commen-
tary, vol. 3, p. 1099.
   For strength. "According to physical need, not for the sake of
indulging appetite, or primarily as a social activity."—SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1099.
   "It was customary for the Hebrews to eat but twice a day,
their heartiest meal coming not far from the middle of the
day."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol.
3, p. 1165.

   What other things should we remember about how to eat?
   1. Eating slowly and chewing thoroughly aids digestion.
   2. Food should be neither too hot nor too cold. Cold food
forces the stomach to spend its energy warming the food rather
than digesting it.
   3. Drinking large quantities of liquid with meals hinders di-
gestion for two reasons: (a) If the liquid is cold, the stomach
must spend energy warming the liquid before it can begin the
work of digestion. (b) The stomach must first absorb the liquid
before it can digest the food.
   4. Overeating weakens the digestive system, making it more
susceptible to disease. Immediate results of overeating can in-
clude headache, indigestion, and stomach pain.
   "Many feel that if they do not eat meat and the grosser arti-
cles of food, they may eat of simple food until they cannot well
eat more. This is a mistake. . . . Overeating has a worse effect
upon the system than overworking; the energies of the soul are
more effectually prostrated by intemperate eating than by in-
temperate working."—Counsels on Diet and Foods, p. 102.
    5. Eating between meals can cause tooth decay and weight
gain, increase the risk of heart attack, delay stomach emptying,
and increase blood-fat levels.

   Summarize in your own words the what and how of eating.

                                                               45
Thursday                                        February 4
PROBLEMS? (Mark 7:15-23; Acts 10:9-19; Col. 2:16; Romans 14).
   What about the scriptural passages many people use when
attempting to counteract biblical dietary teachings?
   Mark 7:15-23. "The context makes emphatically clear that
Jesus was not calling into question in any way any precept of
the Old Testament, but rather was denying the validity of oral
tradition . . . and here specifically the tradition that declared
food eaten with hands improperly washed (in a ritualistic
sense) became the cause of defilement. . . . Had Jesus at this
time eliminated the distinction between clean and unclean flesh
foods it is obvious that Peter would not later have responded as
he did to the idea of eating unclean flesh foods."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 5, p. 624. Furthermore, the Greek word here
translated "meats" means "that which is eaten."
   Acts 10:9-19. Peter received the vision in the setting of phys-
ical hunger. But instead of concerning food, it concerned
human beings. Peter was to experience a hunger for the souls of
all persons everywhere.
   The Spirit's instructions in verse 19 suggest that Peter should
associate the appearance of the delegation with the vision.
    Colossians 2:16. Paul's statement does not imply the aboli-
tion of the law against eating unclean foods, because:
   "1. The meat and drink are declared to be a shadow of Christ
(Col. 2:17) . . .
   "2. The prohibition not to eat certain meats antedates the
ceremonial law (see on Gen. 7:2). Hence, certain animals are to
be viewed as unclean for reasons other than ceremonial. . . . The
apostle is not giving permission to the Colossian Christians to
eat and drink what they want, disregarding all criticism. What
he is saying is that Christians are no longer obliged to carry out
the requirements of the ceremonial law. These meal and drink
offerings have met their fulfillment in Christ."—SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 7, p. 205.
   Romans 14:1-3. Because Paul wrote his first letter to the Co-
rinthians less than a year before he wrote to the Romans, it
seems likely he is discussing the same problem he deals with in
1 Corinthians 8. This problem involves whether a Christian
should eat food sacrificed to idols. Because an idol is nothing,
there is nothing wrong in eating such food.

Friday                                         February 5
FURTHER STUDY: Psalm 104 celebrates creation. As you
meditate upon this psalm, consider the wonders of how God
provided for our nourishment. Also read "Diet and Health,"
"Flesh as Food," and "Extremes in Diet," in The Ministry of
Healing, pp. 295-324.
   Occasionally, conditions justify the use of clean meats as
food. In some lands flesh food is obtainable but not fruits, veg-
etables, et cetera. And some individuals are unable to secure
proper nourishment from natural foods.
   "In certain cases of illness or exhaustion it may be thought
best to use some meat, but great care should be taken to secure
the flesh of healthy animals. . . .
   "Those who have feeble digestive organs can often use meat,
when they cannot eat vegetables, fruit, or porridge."—Counsels
on Diet and Foods, pp. 394, 395.
   "Should health reform in its most extreme form be taught to
those whose circumstances forbid its adoption, more harm than
good would be done. As I preach the gospel to the poor, I am
instructed to tell them to eat that food which is most nourish-
ing."—Testimonies, vol. 9, p. 163.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What duties do we have as Christians to observe proper
     stewardship of the earth so food supplies are plentiful and
     healthful?
   2. Can you explain the texts in Thursday's lesson to a person
      inclined to question or doubt? How could you explain the
      health message to someone who thinks it is the equivalent
      of trying to earn salvation?
   3. What should be our attitude toward those church mem-
      bers who eat differently from the way you do? Rom. 2:1-3;
      Matt. 7:1; 1 Sam. 16:7; Rom. 14:3, 4, 10.
   "It is impossible to make an unvarying rule to regulate every
one's habits, and no one should think himself a criterion for all.
Not all can eat the same things. Foods that are palatable and
wholesome to one person may be distasteful, and even harmful,
to another."—Counsels on Diet and Foods, p. 198.
SUMMARY: What and how we eat are essential to good
health. To the best of our ability we should healthfully prepare
and eat foods that keep our minds and senses clear and vi-
brant.

          Character Building




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: John 15:1-5; Gal. 5:22, 23;
Gen. 3:1-6; 25:29-34; Luke 1:13-17; Matt. 4:1-4; Eph. 6:10-18;
John 12:24, 25.
     MEMORY TEXT: "For whatsoever is born of God over-
     cometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh
     the world, even our faith. Who is he that overcometh the
     world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?"
     (1 John 5:4, 5).
    KEY THOUGHT: "We need to learn that indulged appetite
is the greatest hindrance to mental improvement and soul sanc-
tification."—Counsels on Diet and Foods, p. 127.
   ANOTHER ASPECT. Last week's lesson dealt with the rela-
tionship of diet to body building. This week's lesson will study
how the control of appetite relates to character building.
   "The gratification of unnatural appetite led to the sins that
caused the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. . . . Indulgence
of appetite and passion was the foundation of all their sins."—Coun-
sels on Health, p. 110 (italics supplied).
   The italicized sentence above explains the relationship of bad
physical habits to character building. It suggests (1) the control
of the body over the mind; (2) the surrender of self-respect to
self-gratification; and (3) the worship of self rather than the
worship of God.
  What does 1 John 5:2-5 teach about how to gain control of
our appetites?

CHARACTER DEFINED (John 15:1-5; Gal. 5:22, 23).

  How do the following verses define Christian character?
Matt. 7:16-20; John 15:1-5; Gal. 5:22, 23.


   Committing ourselves to Christ means connecting ourselves
to Him much as a branch connects to a vine. When we establish
this type of connection, God's grace (see 2 Cor. 12:9) will help
us obey His law, the principles of which are listed in Galatians
5:22, 23.

   The fruit of the Spirit is love. "Those who have genuine
love for God will manifest an earnest desire to know His will
and to do it. . . . The child who loves his parents will show that
love by willing obedience; but the selfish, ungrateful child seeks
to do as little as possible . . . , while he at the same time desires
to enjoy all the privileges granted to the obedient and faithful.
The same difference is seen among those who profess to be
children of God. . . .
   "We are commanded to love one another as Christ has loved
us. He has manifested His love by laying down His life to re-
deem us. . . . If we love Christ, we shall love those who resemble
Him in life and character. And not only so, but we shall love
those who have no hope, and are without God in the world'
(Eph. 2:12)."—The Sanctified Life, pp. 81, 82.

   Our love for God will inspire us to do His will. And His will
includes that we be temperate (Gal. 5:23). Intemperate people
seldom are interested in God's will or the welfare of others.
Instead, they constantly seek for ways to gratify their appetites.

   What happens to such persons? Phil. 3:19.


  "The end of such men is ruin; for their appetites are their
God" (Twentieth Century New Testament).

   Tomorrow we will study the lives of some biblical characters
to see that appetite and character development share a vital
link. As you study, determine whether the actions of these per-
sons displayed a genuine love for God.

   What do your eating habits display?

                                                                  49
Monday                                         February 8
STRONG DESIRES (Gen. 3:1-6; 25:29-34; Luke 1:13-17).

  We need not look far in Scripture for a story that teaches
how character development is related to appetite control.
Read Genesis 3:1-6. How did Eve's desire for power and wis-
dom manifest itself?


   When the woman saw. "Three times mention is made of
how charming it [the fruit] was; it appealed to her taste, to her
eye, and to her longing for increased wisdom. Looking at the
tree in this way, with a desire to partake of its fruit, was a
concession to Satan's inducements."—SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 1, p. 230. Thus Eve's appetite not only for the taste of the
fruit but also for something she shouldn't have, led humanity
into sin.

  What does Genesis 25:29-34 teach us about the relationship
between appetite and character development?


  Esau did not recognize the need to turn from temptation,
because he desperately wanted the food and because he was
used to allowing himself what he wanted. He thought about his
desire until his appetite gained the victory. "He thought he
would suffer great inconvenience, and even death, if he could
not have that particular dish. The more he reflected upon it, the
more his desire strengthened, until his birthright lost its value
and sacredness in his sight."—Counsels on Health, p. 110.

   What does John the Baptist's experience teach about appe-
tite and character development? Luke 1:13-17.


   Can you imagine John being mentally, physically, and spiritu-
ally able to do God's will if he had been self-indulgent like
Esau? John's message was, "Get ready for the Lord. Give up
your sensuous pleasures so you will have the strength to follow
Him." (See The Desire of Ages, p. 100.)

   Which person in today's lesson revealed the greatest love
for God? Was this person temperate or intemperate?
   How has your appetite affected your character development?

Tuesday                                            February 9
STANDING IN ADAM'S PLACE (Matt. 4:1-4).
   Yesterday we studied two Bible instances showing how ap-
petite and character development are related. Today we'll
study the most important instance of all. As you read Mat-
thew 4:1-4, notice the extent of Christ's fast. How long have
you gone without food; how hungry did you become?

   Everything was lost when Adam and Eve allowed their ap-
petite to control their decision making. But Christ had come to
stand in their place. The time involved in His fast and the con-
ditions under which it took place attest to the sinfulness and
power of appetite upon humankind.
  What does Christ's experience say about the importance of
having our appetites under control?

  "Of all the lessons to be learned from our Lord's first great
temptation none is more important than that bearing upon the
control of the appetites and passions. . . . Through intemper-
ance, Satan works to destroy the mental and moral powers that
God gave to man as a priceless endowment. Thus it becomes
impossible for men to appreciate things of eternal worth."—The
Desire of Ages, p. 122.
   How did Christ answer Satan? Matt. 4:4.

   When we discover the power residing in His Word, we will
be able to resist Satan's suggestions. Our concern will not be
how to gratify physical appetite, but how to gratify spiritual
hunger. The "food" that will be the most satisfying will be the
answers to the questions What is God's command? and What
are His promises?
   "In the last great conflict of the controversy with Satan those
who are loyal to God will see every earthly support cut off. Be-
cause they refuse to break His law in obedience to earthly pow-
ers, they will be forbidden to buy or sell. . . . But to the obedient is
given the promise, . . . 'bread shall be given him; his waters shall
be sure.' Isa. 33:16."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 121,122.
  If we do not learn to control our appetites now, how will it
be for us in "the last great conflict"?
                                                                     51

HIS VICTORY IS OURS (Eph. 6:10-18; John 16:33; 1 John
5:4).

   What battle rages in the life of every Christian? Gal. 5:16-
25; Eph. 6:10-18; 1 Peter 2:11.


  We witness the struggle between the inclination to do right
and the inclination to do evil in the battle over appetite. Upon
what fact can we base our hope of victory? John 16:33; 1 John 5:4.


    "Who will enter in through the gates into the city?—Not
those who declare that they cannot break the force of appetite.
Christ has resisted the power of him who would hold us in
bondage; though weakened by His long fast of forty days, He
withstood temptation, and proved by this act that our cases are
not hopeless. I know that we cannot obtain the victory alone;
and how thankful we should be that we have a living Saviour,
who is ready and willing to aid us!
   "A pure and noble life, a life of victory over appetite and lust,
is possible to everyone who will unite his weak, wavering human
will to the omnipotent, unwavering will of God."—Counsels on
Diet and Foods, pp. 169, 170.

    To everyone who will unite. These words from the quota-
tion above suggest there is something for us to do to help win
the battle against appetite. What do you think that something
is?
    "You cannot change your heart, you cannot of yourself give
to God its affections; but you can choose to serve Him. You can
give Him your will; He will then work in you to will and to do
according to His good pleasure."—Steps to Christ, p. 47.

  Yet even surrendering our will to Christ depends on faith.
No one chooses righteousness unless that person first believes.
Those whom Christ healed believed in Him before they chose to
obey His words. Their behavior exhibited their faith that His
word was true.

  Have you chosen Christ to the point where He can work in
you according to His pleasure? If so, how do you think this
will affect your appetite and character development?

A PLEDGE OF IMMORTALITY (John 12:24, 25).
  This week's lesson has shown that character development
and appetite are closely related. How does Jesus illustrate this
point? John 12:24, 25.

  "All who would bring forth fruit as workers together with
Christ must first fall into the ground and die. The life must be
cast into the furrow of the world's need. Self-love, self-interest,
must perish. And the law of self-sacrifice is the law of self-
preservation. The husbandman preserves his grain by casting it
away. So in human life. To give is to live. The life that will be
preserved is the life that is freely given in service to God and
man. Those who for Christ's sake sacrifice their life in this
world will keep it unto life eternal."—The Desire of Ages,
pp. 623, 624.
   Living to give is one of the main reasons for controlling one's
appetite. It is impossible to live for others while we are busy
indulging ourselves. Further, indulging our appetite hinders
mental and spiritual development, making it difficult to assist
others when they need it.
   What is the symbol of our death to self-indulgence and
self-interest? Luke 9:23.

   "The cross, the cross; lift it, . . . and in the act of raising it you
will be astonished to find that it raises you, it supports you. In
adversity, privation, and sorrow it will be a strength and a staff
to you. You will find it all hung with mercy, compassion, sym-
pathy, and inexpressible love. It will prove to you a pledge of
immortality. May you be able to say with Paul: 'God forbid that
I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by
whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the
world.' "—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 47.

  What are your motives for ridding your life of self-
indulgence? Do you feel as Paul did about the cross? How
does looking upon the cross help you to recognize your imp-
ure desires? How does looking at the cross free you from
these desires? Be specific.

                                                                      53
Friday                                           February 12
FURTHER STUDY: Read "Christian Character" in The Sancti-
fied Life, pp. 80-88, and "The Temptation" in The Desire of Ages,
pp. 114-123. Also read Galatians 5. What does it mean to walk
in the Spirit? Does it mean the same thing as placing yourself
"in right relation to God"? (See the first sentence of the follow-
ing quotation.)
   "Will you not without delay place yourself in right relation
to God? Will you not say, 'I will give my will to Jesus, and I will
do it now,' and from this moment be wholly on the Lord's side?
Disregard custom and the strong clamoring of appetite and pas-
sion. . . . Say, 'I will believe, I do believe that God is my helper,'
and you will find that you are triumphant in God."—Testimo-
nies, vol. 5, p. 514.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Reread the first sentence in the above quotation. Where
     will we be (figuratively speaking) when we place our-
     selves in right relation to God?
     2. In what way did Christ's battles against appetite reveal
        His love for us?
     3. John was called to be a reformer. In what respect has God
        called the Seventh-day Adventist Church to be an agency
        of reform? (Review Lesson 3.) What can you do to be a
        part of that reform, both personally and in helping others?
     4. What other biblical accounts show a relationship between
        appetite and character development? Did these persons'
        behavior reflect their love for God or for self?
     5. Eve ate fruit she was not supposed to eat. And Esau sold
        his birthright for a bowl of lentils. What was it that made
        these seemingly minor items major?
     6. How does overeating relate to appetite and character
        building? On what level does Scripture put the sin of glut-
        tony and why? Prov. 23:20, 21.
SUMMARY: Eve, Esau, Daniel, John the Baptist, and Christ all
show us that appetite and character development share a vital
link. Only by surrendering ourselves at the foot of the cross
can we enable the Lord to help us surmount the temptation to
gratify appetite. Only thus can He help us build characters for
heaven.

 Striving for the Mastery




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Cor. 5:14; John 15:5; Ex.
16:15, 18-20; 2 Peter 1:4-10; 1 Cor. 9:24-27.

  MEMORY TEXT: "And every man that striveth for the
  mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to ob-
  tain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible" (1 Cor-
  inthians 9:25).

   KEY THOUGHT: "God's people are to learn the meaning of
temperance in all things. . . . Before they can really understand
the meaning of true sanctification and of conformity to the will
of Christ, they must, by cooperating with God, obtain the mas-
tery over wrong habits and practices."—Temperance, pp. 138,
139 (italics supplied).

   OLD-FASHIONED? In the Greek New Testament, we find
the word egkrateia, meaning self-control. In 1611, the King James
Bible translated it as "temperance." The word temperance may
seem old-fashioned to us. But the concept of temperance never
goes out of style. What is old-fashioned about developing habits
that lead to a more satisfying life? Yet for the Christian, the
major reason for self-control is expressed in the Key Thought.
Second Corinthians 7:1 tells us how closely sanctification and
self-control are related. Also read Ephesians 5:25-27. "Here is
Bible sanctification. . . . It is truth received in the heart, and
practically carried out in the life."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 339.
   This week we will take a look at the broad aspects of self-
control. Next week we will study temperance in relation to spe-
cific areas of life.
                                                               55

WHAT CONTROLS YOU? (1 Cor. 13; 2 Cor. 5:14; 2 John 5, 6).
  What motivation do we have for being temperate (self-
controlled) in all things? 2 Cor. 5:14.

     "It is Christ's love that controls me" (Goodspeed).
     "Christ's love compels us" (NW).
   How has Christ expressed His love? John 3:16; 1 John 3:1, 3,
9, 16. In what way does this love constrain us? 2 John 5, 6.

   We express living a controlled life in two ways—loving acts
that honor God and loving acts that bless those with whom we
associate (see Matt 22:35-40).
   "Have I not a right to do as I please with my own body?—
No, you have no moral right, because you are violating the laws
of life and health. . . . You are the Lord's property, His by
creation and His by redemption. 'Thou shalt love thy neighbour
as thyself.' The law of self-respect and [respect] for the property
of the Lord is here brought to view. And this will lead to respect
for the obligations which every human being is under to pre-
serve the living machinery."—Temperance, p. 213.
   List below some of the phrases 1 Corinthians 13 uses to
define love. Then consider what these phrases mean in light
of Matthew 22:35-40 and 2 John 5, 6.

   First Corinthians 13:1-3 implies that some people are moti-
vated by things other than love. What might some of these
other motivations be?

  Selfish motives render a person blind to God's requirements
and the needs of those around us. But those motivated by the
love of Christ, who reigns within their heart, will seek ways to
honor God and bless those with whom they associate.
   How would you answer the question in today's title? De-
fine how love is related to self-control.

BECOMING SELF-CONTROLLED (John 15:5; Ps. 139:14;
Mark 9:43).
   Having established the proper motivation for self-control in
all areas of life, we need to establish how we become temperate.
  Step 1—John 15:5; Acts 3:19. We begin to achieve self-control
when we realize that without Christ we are incapable of doing
anything good. This realization then hopefully causes us to re-
pent and turn away from sin.
   The Greek word translated as "repent" in Acts 3:19 means
"to change the mind." The Greek word translated as "be
converted" means "to turn about." Relate the meanings of
these words to the process of becoming self-controlled and
establishing more healthful habits.

   Step 2—Psalm 139:14. Learning how we "are fearfully and
wonderfully made" is an asset when it comes to developing
temperance. If we know how the body functions or why we feel
the way we do about a situation, we can develop habits that
will enhance our physical and emotional health.
   Step 3—Underline the word in the paragraph below that
illustrates the next step in developing self-control. "Let the
will be kept awake and rightly directed, and it will impart en-
ergy to the whole being and will be a wonderful aid in the
maintenance of health. . . . Exercised in the right direction, it
would control the imagination, and be a potent means of resist-
ing and overcoming disease of both mind and body."—The
Ministry of Healing, p. 246.
   Step 4—Set realistic goals. For example, don't start an exer-
cise program by jogging a mile (1.6 kilometers) right away. Start
by jogging a short distance, then walking back. Increase this
distance gradually until you work up to your desired distance.
(Remember to consult your doctor before starting any vigorous
exercise program.)
    Step 5—Mark 9:43. Walk away from what's tempting you.
For example, if you can't control what you watch on television,
get rid of it.
   How do these five steps compare with the steps in lesson 4
for making changes? Why not make the first step now? Or is
there something holding you back?

                                                              57

TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING (Ex. 16:15, 18-20).

   What aspect of a healthful lifestyle does Exodus 16:15, 18-
20 suggest?

   Each Israelite received just enough manna for his or her
needs. Thus, no one went hungry, nor did anyone go to ex-
tremes by eating too much.

   Shunning the extreme. "Those who understand the laws of
health and who are governed by principle, will shun the ex-
tremes, both of indulgence and of restriction. Their diet is cho-
sen, not for the mere gratification of appetite, but for the
upbuilding of the body. They seek to preserve every power in
the best condition for highest service to God and man. The
appetite is under the control of reason and conscience, and they
are rewarded with health of body and mind. While they do not
urge their views offensively upon others, their example is a
testimony in favor of right principles. These persons have a
wide influence for good."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 319.

  Judging from what we've studied so far this quarter, do
you think the above paragraph applies only to diet? What
other words could we substitute for that one?


   "The word [temperance] includes much more than absti-
nence from intoxicating drinks. It signifies moderation in all
things and complete control over every passion and appetite.
Excesses of every kind are excluded." —SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 6, p. 982.

   How does Exodus 16:15, 18-20 illustrate the avoidance of
extremes?


   Mike decided to follow God's original diet. But until then,
he was habitually careless in his selection of food. After only
a few days of nuts, fruits, and grains, he experienced stomach
pain and digestive problems. Was he being extreme to make
such changes so rapidly?
   What can you do personally to avoid extremes as you at-
tempt to achieve a healthful lifestyle?

A RUNG IN THE LADDER (2 Peter 1:4-10).

  What part does temperance play on what has been called
Peter's ladder of Christian life? 2 Peter 1:4-10.


  Why do you think it is significant that temperance is the
middle rung?


   Temperance has an important place in the ladder of Chris-
tian spiritual growth. In the believer's life "knowledge" pre-
cedes "temperance," and "patience" follows it. These verses
announce a physiological truth. A knowledgeable person tends
to be self-controlled and a self-controlled person tends to be
patient. Temperance is the fruit of divine knowledge.

   "The preceding qualities will be of little avail if not accompa-
nied by self-control on the Christian's part."—SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 7, p. 597.

  "For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you
that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful" (2 Peter 1:8).
The Greek word for barren in this verse means "lazy" or "idle."
A person who, with God's help, has developed the graces Peter
mentions in 2 Peter 1:4-7 will be compelled to work for others
and for their Saviour.

  How does the Christian grace of self-control compel a per-
son to work for Christ and others?


   Self-control is a safeguard against the creeping moral paraly-
sis and physical and mental decline of today's world. While
nations spend billions to erect and maintain strong defense sys-
tems, the goal of the Seventh-day Adventist Church is to safe-
guard the church and the world from intemperance, disease,
and premature death.

   How well do you think the church is doing regarding this
goal? What are you personally doing to help? Is there a need
for enlarging your temperance witness? If so, how?



                                                                 59
Thursday                                      February 18
RUNNING THE RACE; RECEIVING THE PRIZE (1 Cor.
9:24-27).

   What background lies behind the motif of running a race
in 1 Corinthians 9:24-27, and how does it apply to self-control?


   To make his point about using self-denial in order to help
others, Paul refers to the famous athletic games of Greece. These
games consisted of contests in foot racing, boxing, wrestling,
and throwing the discus.
    In order to be victorious, athletes of these games needed to
have their appetites and passions under control. They needed to
abstain from stimulants and excitement that would weaken not
only their bodies but their minds. And even those things that
were good for them they could use or do only in moderation.
   Those seeking the prize of eternal life must follow a similar
program. God will not grant us eternal life if we believe our
present life is merely an opportunity to get and do everything
we want.
    Instead, eternal life belongs "to those who use this present
life as an opportunity to gain the victory over everything that
would interfere with mental, physical, and spiritual health, thus
demonstrating their true love for, and obedience to, the Saviour,
who endured so much for them."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol.
6, pp. 736, 737.

  How does the ministry of health reform and exercising self-
denial promote the salvation of others?


   "The Lord has presented before me that many, many will be
rescued from physical, mental, and moral degeneracy through
the practical influence of health reform. Health talks will be
given, publications will be multiplied. The principles of health
reform will be received with favor, and many will be enlight-
ened."—Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 378, 379.

   Many think our church standards are going by the wayside,
and we are losing our distinctiveness. Is health reform a
standard of the church? If so, in what way? How does the
church hold up this standard if the members are at different
levels of growth and we are not to judge them?

FURTHER STUDY: Meditate upon 2 Peter 1:4-10; 2 Corinthi-
ans 5:14; and 2 John 5:6 in conjunction with John 15:4-10. What
similarities do you find in these passages? How do these rela-
tionships enlarge your understanding of self-control as part of
the Christian lifestyle? Also read "Ministers to Teach Health
Reform" in Testimonies, vol. 6, pp. 376, 377; "Christian
Temperance" and "Extremes in Health Reforms," in Testimo-
nies, vol. 2, pp. 354-390; or "A Higher Standard" in The Acts of
the Apostles, pp. 309-322.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How has this lesson changed your view of temperance?

  2. After studying this week's lesson, how would you explain
     the Christian concept of self-control to a curious neighbor?

SUMMARY: True temperance is refusing to use or do any-
thing harmful and using or doing in moderation those things
which are good. It is motivated by our love for God and fellow
human beings. And we receive the strength for it from our
heavenly Father.

Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Prov. 20:13; 23:1, 29-35;
25:27; Eccl. 3:17; 12:12; Mark 4:19.
     MEMORY TEXT: "Thy hands have made me and fash-
     ioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy
     commandments" (Psalm 119:73).
   KEY THOUGHT: Temperance stands on a broad platform of
self-control (Lesson 8). These principles of self-control enable us
to deal with the specifics of moderation and abstinence as we
strive, with God's help, to reach the goal of temperance, which
is having clear minds so we can better discern God's will.
   MADE AND FASHIONED. What Old Testament verse
could the psalmist have had in mind when he wrote this week's
Memory Text? (See Genesis 2:7.) Because God created human-
kind, David asked God to give him understanding so he could
learn God's commandments. We can ask God for the same
favor in relationship to our health and His laws regarding self-
control. Since He created us, He knows what is best for us phys-
ically, mentally, and spiritually. We will look at some areas of
temperance most apt to touch our lives. For now, review the
steps in Lessons 4 and 8 for making changes and becoming
temperate. (You might outline these steps on a separate paper
to keep with you as you study.) Be ready to apply these steps to
any of the areas in the lesson where you feel you need help.

EXCESSES (Prov. 20:13; Eccl. 3:17; 12:12; Mark 4:19).

   Underline the specific aspect of self-control that each of the
following quotations discusses. Perhaps some of them will
surprise you.
   1. "Excessive indulgence in eating, drinking, sleeping or see-
ing, is sin. The harmonious healthy action of all the powers of
body and mind results in happiness."—Temperance, p. 138.
   2. "We should practice temperance in our labor. It is not our
duty to place ourselves where we shall be overworked. . . .
   "As a rule, the labor of the day should not be prolonged into
the evening. . . . I have been shown that those who do this, often
lose much more than they gain, for their energies are exhausted,
and they labor on nervous excitement."—Temperance, pp. 139,
140.
   3. "Intemperance in study is a species of intoxication, and
those who indulge in it, like the drunkard, wander from safe
paths, and stumble and fall in the darkness."—Temperance, p.
140.
   4. "One of the most fruitful sources of shattered constitutions
among men is a devotion to the getting of money, an inordinate
desire for wealth. They narrow their lives to the single pursuit
of money, sacrifice rest, sleep, and the comforts of life to this
one object."—Temperance, p. 140.

  What aspects of modern life could we classify under
"seeing" (number one in the list above)?


  In what ways are riches deceitful? What is meant by the
"word," and how does the "deceitfulness of riches" choke it?
Mark 4:19.


  In what way were the individuals in Luke 12:16-21 and
18:18-23 out of control, and how did it affect their lives? In
what way do their stories shed meaning on Mark 4:19?


  Both men were so obsessed with making money that they
overlooked the greatest treasure of all—eternal life with their
Saviour. Intemperance choked the gospel from their hearts and
prevented them from bearing godly fruit.


                                                                63
Monday                                       February 22
YET ANOTHER EXCESS! (Prov. 23:1, 2, 21).
   If someone were to ask you what is the "prevailing sin of
this age," how would you answer? Would you be surprised
by the following quotation?

   "Gluttony is the prevailing sin of this age. Lustful appetite
makes slaves of men and women, and beclouds their intel-
lects and stupefies their moral sensibilities to such a degree
that the sacred, elevated truths of God's word are not appre-
ciated."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 486.
   Thus overeating directly thwarts the goal of self-control--to
have clear minds in order to discern better God's will for our
lives.
   "The energies of the soul are more effectually prostrated by
intemperate eating than by intemperate working. . . .
   "All that is taken into the stomach, above what the system
can use to convert into good blood, clogs the machinery; for it
cannot be made into either flesh or blood and its presence bur-
dens the liver, and produces a morbid condition of the sys-
tem."—Counsels on Diet and Foods, pp. 102, 103.
   Habitual overeating can cause obesity, which in turn can in-
crease the risk of contracting certain types of cancer. Obesity
can also be a factor in type H diabetes, hypertension, high blood
glucose, and high cholesterol.
   Other problems caused by overeating include headaches, in-
digestion, and abdominal pain.
    Paraphrase the advice given in Proverbs 23:1, 2, 21. How is
it that a glutton can "come to poverty"?

  "Control yourself if you have a big appetite" (Prov. 23:2,
New Century Version).
   Certainly verse 2 is not advocating suicide. It uses exaggera-
tion as a literary device to emphasize the seriousness of the
point: Overeating is such an important matter that we should
take whatever steps necessary to resist the temptation.
   Since overeating "beclouds" the intellect and "stupefies"
one's "moral sensibilities," how should we eat, especially on
the Sabbath, and why?

CLOUDED BRAINS; COMMON DRUG (Prov. 25:27; 1 Cor.
10:31).

  What advice does the first part of Proverbs 25:27 give?
What "modern" word could we substitute for the word
honey?


   Clouded brains. Sugar "causes fermentation, and this clouds
the brain and brings peevishness into the disposition. . . .
   "From the light given me, sugar, when largely used, is more
injurious than meat."—Counsels on Diet and Foods, pp. 327, 328.

   An excess of sugar can be responsible for many health prob-
lems. First of all, the acid formed by sugar and bacteria in the
mouth causes tooth decay. Children are especially susceptible
to this problem. An excess of sugar (as well as fat) can also
cause obesity. To the problems of obesity mentioned in
yesterday's lesson, we can add that early death increases as the
degree of obesity increases.
   There is also a relationship between sugar and diabetes. A
diabetic-prone individual may defer this disease by eating a
diet high in complex carbohydrates and low in refined sugar.
   And finally, sugar decreases white-cell activity. These cells
are instrumental in helping the body fight disease and infection.

   A common drug. What do coffee, tea, some pain relievers,
and some soft drinks have in common? Caffeine. And because
caffeine is a drug, it will cause side effects.
   Caffeine raises your blood sugar, blood pressure, and heart
rate. It can cause ulcers, an acid stomach, and heartburn. It also
increases the risk of heart disease.
   Caffeine also can cause anxiety, depression, and birth de-
fects. Animal studies have shown that high amounts of this
drug can cause skeletal birth defects, retarded fetal growth, re-
duced birth weights, and increased stillbirths. Just 2 cups of
coffee per day may retard bone growth.
   The physiological effects of caffeine can be achieved with
only 1-3 cups of coffee. A child who drinks only one caffeinated
soda drinks the equivalent of 4 cups of coffee for an adult.

   Review 1 Corinthians 10:31. Could either caffeine or an ex-

"WHO HATH REDNESS OF EYES?" (Prov. 23:29-35).
   What is responsible in one country alone for 30 percent of
all suicides; 55 percent of all auto deaths; 60 percent of all
child abuse; 85 percent of all home violence? Prov. 23:29-35.
(Figures from Kathleen Whalen Fitzgerald, Alcoholism [New
York: Doubleday, 19881, p. x11.)

   Just one or two alcoholic drinks decreases the brain's ability
to gather information from more than one source at a time. The
same amount also impairs memory, perception, and judgment.
Alcohol also affects the following bodily systems:
   1. The immune system—Alcohol decreases the white cells'
ability to fight disease, thus increasing the risks of pneumonia,
tuberculosis, hepatitis, and several cancers.
   2. The endocrine system—Only 2 or 3 alcoholic drinks per
day increase the risks of miscarriages, stillbirths, and premature
births.
   3. The circulatory system—The use of alcohol increases the
risk of coronary heart disease, reduces blood sugar, and el-
evates blood fats and blood pressure, thus increasing hyperten-
sion.
   4. The digestive system—Alcohol irritates the stomach,
thereby causing gastric ulcers and bleeding. Perhaps the organ
most affected by alcohol is the liver, the primary site of metabo-
lism. Habitual use of alcohol raises the risk of fatty liver,
hepatitis, and cirrhosis of the liver.
  How does Leviticus 10:1-11 demonstrate the effect alcohol
can have on a person's judgment?

   Strange fire (verse 1). This is ordinary fire not taken from the
altar of burnt offering, whose fire God Himself had started.
   Do not drink (verse 9). "This prohibition suggests the cause
of the transgression. . . .
   "Wine and strong drink can so benumb the faculties that
man fails to make a clear distinction between right and wrong,
between holy and unholy, between clean and unclean. This had
led the two sons to take common fire as they entered the sanc-
tuary; in their condition they could see no difference."—SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 749.

BUT IT'S IN THE BIBLE! (Deut. 14:22-26; 1 Tim. 5:23).
   Yesterday we discussed the effects alcohol has on the body
and what the Bible has to say against the use of this drug.
Today we will study two major passages Christians use to jus-
tify their moderate use of alcohol.
   Deuteronomy 14:22-26. The Hebrew words in verse 26 for
"wine" and "strong drink" were used generically to denote
either a fermented or unfermented drink. Also, the source of the
Hebrew word for "strong drink" never included the concept of
"strong." Originally the word referred to any sweet beverage
that could turn bitter once it fermented.
   That "wine" and "strong drink" in verse 26 refer to unfer-
mented and sweet beverages make even more sense when we
consider the context of the verse. Verses 22-26 instructed the
Israelites on how to prepare for the yearly harvest festival when
they brought their tithes to God to celebrate His goodness. Dur-
ing this celebration the priests instructed the people in several
aspects of their lives, including sacred fellowship with God and
the strengthening of family ties. How could the Israelites re-
ceive such instructions while under the influence of alcohol?
   1 Timothy 5:23. Here Paul gives Timothy some advice to
help alleviate a medical problem. But once again, the Greek
word for "wine" was used generically to signify either fer-
mented or unfermented grape juice.
   Furthermore, the practice of using unfermented grape juice
for medicinal purposes is well documented. Aristotle (384-322
B.C.), Athenaeus (A.D. 280), and Pliny (A.D. 24-79; a contempo-
rary of Paul's), each advised the use of sweet grape juice, or
sweet wine, either mixed with water or warmed to alleviate
stomach disorders.
   Does Paul's advice in 1 Timothy 6:11, 12 seem unrealistic if
he were actually advising Timothy to use alcohol for medici-
nal purposes? Would it be possible for Timothy to "follow
after righteousness" and to "fight the good fight of faith" if
he were clouding his mind with even a small bit of alcohol for
medicinal purposes?

  (For more detail concerning these verses, see Wine in the Bible,
by Samuele Bacchiocchi, published by Biblical Perspectives,

                                                               67
Friday                                         February 26
FURTHER STUDY: How can we apply 2 Corinthians 5:10 and
James 2:26 to what we have studied this week? Also read
Counsels on Health, pp. 71, 157, 160 (on gluttony); 81-90 (to-
bacco and drugs); 98-100 (moderation, temperance); "Gain
That Is Loss" in Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 252-259; and "One
Thing Thou Lackest" in The Desire of Ages, pp. 518-523.
   What will kill more than 3 million people worldwide this
year? What will kill nearly 1 million people worldwide every
month by the year 2020? The answer is tobacco-related diseases.
   Generally speaking, tobacco damages every part of the
human body with which it comes in contact. From cancer of the
lip, mouth, tongue, and lungs, to heart and circulatory damage,
tobacco stands condemned as one of the most ruthless killers of
our age. Furthermore, while tobacco does not intoxicate, it does
contain nicotine, a dependency-producing drug. Nicotine
reaches the brain within 7 seconds. That's twice as fast as heroin
shot into the veins.
   The Bible doesn't mention tobacco specifically. In fact, it was
unknown in biblical times. But what general verses relating to
health can you think of that denounce the use of tobacco in any
form?

     DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
     1. The tobacco industry is concentrating much of its market-
        ing effort in Third World countries. In most of these
        places, tobacco products carry no warning labels and are
        often distributed free, even to children. How can Chris-
        tians hinder such activities? Is it enough simply to work
        against the tobacco giants?

     2. As you read Revelation 22:14, 15 from the King James
        Version, notice the word sorcerers. The Greek word is phar-
        makos or "poisoner." The related word pharmakon means
        "drug." Ancient sorcery involved the use of drugs. Think
        about modern drug problems and the "sorcerers" who
        promote the use of drugs. What relationship do you see
        between them and their Revelation counterparts?

SUMMARY: Because God created us, we can ask Him for
understanding regarding His laws of health. Then we can
apply these laws to specific aspects of our lives in order to
attain the goal of temperance—clear minds that readily per-
ceive God's will.

            "The Very Best
              Medicine"




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 5:38-47; 6:1-13, 25-
34; 7:12.
  MEMORY TEXT: "For God hath not given us the spirit of
  fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind"
  (2 Timothy 1:7).
   KEY THOUGHT: "The religion of the Bible is not detrimen-
tal to the health of either body or mind. The influence of the
Spirit of God is the very best medicine for disease. Heaven is all
health; and the more deeply heavenly influences are realized,
the more sure will be the recovery of the believing invalid. The
true principles of Christianity open before all a source of inesti-
mable happiness."—Counsels on Health, p. 28.
   THE URGE TO SCREAM. Military war breaks out in yet
another part of the world as you continue to fight your own
wars at home. A friend betrays you. There are so many people
around you who really need help in some form or other. Econo-
mies fluctuate on almost a daily basis. People lose their jobs.
And you begin to experience a feeling that more bad things are
going to happen. So you begin to worry. The anxiety wears
down your immunity. You catch a cold. The urge to scream
wells up in your throat.
   But stop! What is this about heavenly influences and health?
Yes, even medical research is beginning to prove what Christ
has been telling us all along—the principles of Christianity pro-
vide vigor to soul and body.
                                                                69

WHITE ANTS (Matt. 6:25-34).
   A multitude. That's how many came to hear Jesus speak.
And even though they lived in a different time and place, they
worried about their lives just as we do. As you read Matthew
6:25-34, remember that you are a member of a modern multi-
tude also in need of faith, security, peace, and hope.
   Worry and our immune system. Life can be a stressful state
of affairs. And such stress can cause illness. A team of research-
ers studied 34 family caregivers of Alzheimer's-disease patients.
The stress these 34 people experienced was ongoing and op-
pressive. The results showed that their immune systems had
lower percentages of cells that help fight viruses than had other
comparable persons. Caregivers who attended support groups,
even though they had been caregivers for a long time, had
higher percentages of these desirable killer cells. (Adapted from
Norman Cousins, Head First: The Biology of Hope [New York: E.
P. Dutton, 19891, p. 39.)

  Prescription for worry. "If you will seek the Lord and be
converted every day . . . all your murmurings will be stilled, all
your difficulties will be removed, all the perplexing problems
that now confront you will be solved."—Thoughts From the
Mount of Blessing, p. 101.

   How did Paul and Daniel manage to keep their faith
strong? 2 Cor. 11:24-28; Phil. 4:13; Dan. 6:10.


  What other means exist for keeping our faith alive and
well? Isa. 26:3; 48:18; Phil 4:4, 8.


   "The immune system is a mirror to life, responding to its joy
and anguish, its exuberance and boredom, its laughter and
tears, its excitement and depression, its problems and pros-
pects. Scarcely anything that enters the mind doesn't find its
way into the workings of the body."—Head First: The Biology of
Hope, pp. 35-37.

  "White ants pick a carcass cleaner than a lion." How are
worries like white ants? How can you administer the above
prescription this very moment to cure your worries?

SHARE YOUR BLESSINGS (Matt. 6:1-4; Isa. 58:7).
   Imagine again that you are part of the multitude listening to
Jesus as He describes the principles of His kingdom. You are so
fraught with the urge to get as much as you can that when you
have the opportunity to share, your first concern is What's in it
for me?
   What does Jesus say about this in Matthew 6:1-4? (Doing or
giving alms can be translated as giving to the needy.)

   "We are to give in sincerity, not to make a show of our good
deeds, but from pity and love to the suffering ones. Sincerity of
purpose, real kindness of heart, is the motive that Heaven val-
ues."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 81.
  Review this week's Key Thought. How does giving in "sin-
cerity of purpose" and "real kindness of heart" help us to
realize more deeply the "heavenly influences"?

   How does Isaiah 58:5-11 describe this principle of religion?
What does this passage say is the reward of living this princi-
ple?

    "Every ray of light shed upon others will be reflected upon
our own hearts. Every kind and sympathizing word spoken to
the sorrowful, every act to relieve the oppressed, and every gift
to supply the necessities of our fellow beings, given or done
with an eye to God's glory, will result in blessings to the giver.
. . . The pleasure of doing good to others imparts a glow to the
feelings which flashes through the nerves, quickens the circula-
tion of the blood, and induces mental and physical health."
—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 56.
   How can sharing our blessings with others be a remedy for
selfishness and covetousness?

   Read James 1:27. How can you help someone today?



                                                               71

A HOLIER ATMOSPHERE (Matt. 6:5-13).
 What third health-producing principle of Christianity does
Matthew 6:5-13 tell us about?


  Communion with God through prayer keeps us in touch
with the "heavenly influences" mentioned in this week's Key
Thought. When we take our anxieties to Him and leave them
there, we clear the muddied channels of our lives so His peace
and love can flow through us unhindered. "We may close every
door to impure imaginings and unholy thoughts by lifting the
soul into the presence of God through sincere prayer. Those
whose hearts are open to receive the support and blessing of
God will walk in a holier atmosphere than that of earth and will
have constant communion with heaven."—Steps to Christ, p. 99.

   What conditions must we meet in order for God to hear our
prayers? Matt. 6:7, 11, 12; Heb. 11:6; 1 Thess. 5:17; 2 Citron.
7:14; Ps. 66:18, 19.


   When Jesus prayed in Gethsemane, He begged God to re-
lease Him from His mission. Yet at the same time, He was able
to pray, "Not my will, but yours." How difficult it is for us to
reach beyond our meager, stubborn will in order to claim God's
loftier desires. So often our prayers are demands for God to do
things our way. When this is the case our tensions mount. Only
when we are willing to "let go and let God" can we rise from
prayer filled with healing.

   What aspects of prayer do we often forget? Col. 4:2; Job
42:10; Ps. 46:10; 95:6.


   When we pray only for ourselves, it is easy to remain selfish.
Only when Job began praying for others did his situation begin
to change. When we praise God and worship Him through
prayer, we soar above our anxieties and remember that He is in
control, that He will answer our prayers according to what is
best for us.

   How can your prayer life improve? How can prayer relieve
any tension you may be experiencing now? Can you share a
time when prayer made a difference in your life?

GOODWILL TOWARD MEN (Matt. 5:38-47).
   Summarize the principle of Christianity that Jesus de-
scribes in Matthew 5:38-47.

   How many times have you determined, I'll get even with that
person if it's the last thing I ever do! Such concerns for justice are
never pure. Nor are they healthy, because they foster such nega-
tive emotions as hate and bitterness.
   Dr. James R. Averill divided 54 students into three groups:
(1) a sadness group, (2) a happy group, and (3) a control group.
The sad group watched a sad film. The happy group watched a
funny film, and the control group viewed a boring documen-
tary.
   While each person in each group watched their particular
film, his or her blood pressure, heart rate, and respiration were
taken. Averill discovered that positive emotions caused respira-
tory changes, while sadness caused changes in blood pressure.
These results persuaded Averill that emotions do indeed affect
our physical well-being. (Adapted from Head First: A Biology of
Hope, p. 133.)
   So what is the Christian alternative to the negative emotions
that seeking vengeance produces? God's children must, with no
ulterior motives, exhibit goodwill toward others. When an in-
jured person exhibits such goodwill to his or her oppressor,
both are directed toward God.
   "The demand of Christ is not that we 'resolve to like every-
body,' but rather that we act in good will from God toward
those we like and those we do not like."—The Interpreter's Bible,
vol. 7, pp. 302, 303.
   Such is the love of God, "which Christ diffuses through the
whole being. . . . Every vital part—the brain, the heart, the
 nerves—it touches with healing. By it the highest energies of the
being are roused to activity. It frees the soul from the guilt and
sorrow, the anxiety and care, that crush the life forces. With it
 come serenity and composure. It implants in the soul, joy . . .
 health-giving, life-giving joy."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 115.
  What Bible stories illustrate the principle of Matthew 5:38-
47? After studying today's lesson, how might you interpret
Psalm 18:48?



                                                                   73

"ONE COMPREHENSIVE PRINCIPLE" (Matt. 7:12).

   How is the principle expressed in Matthew 7:12 related to
each section of this week's lesson? In what ways do you think
this principle can be health-producing?


   "On the assurance of the love of God toward us, Jesus en-
joins love to one another, in one comprehensive principle cover-
ing all the relations of human fellowship.
   "The Jews had been concerned about what they should re-
ceive; the burden of their anxiety was to secure what they
thought their due of power and respect and service. But Christ
teaches that our anxiety should not be, How much are we to re-
ceive? but, How much can we give? The standard of our obliga-
tion to others is found in what we ourselves would regard as their
obligation to us."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 134.

   "We need to be treated as if there were something in us that
is beyond price despite our brokenness."—The Interpreter's Bible,
vol. 7, p. 330.

  Judging by the principle expressed in Matthew 7:12, could
we also say that we need to treat others "as if there were
something in them that is beyond price" despite their broken-
ness? What is that "something"? What will happen when
Christians begin taking Matthew 7:12 seriously?


   Matthew 7:12 "is the truth as it is in Jesus. When those who
profess the name of Christ shall practice the principles of the
golden rule, the same power will attend the gospel as in apos-
tolic times."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessings, p. 137.

   How can the people in the following situations apply Mat-
thew 7:12?
   • Deborah is the head of her department at work. One of the
men working for her resents "answering" to a woman. How
should Deborah treat this person? (Yes, Deborah is a Christian.)
   • On your way to Sabbath School you notice a woman
struggling with two small children and a flat tire. If you stop to
help her, you'll be late. But then it's Sabbath. Should you even
think about stopping?

FURTHER STUDY: Read the Beatitudes in Matthew 5:3-12.
Then decide with which area of this week's lesson each beati-
tude belongs. Also read The Desire of Ages, "The Sermon on the
Mount," pp. 298-314; The Ministry of Healing, "Mind Cure,"
pp. 241-259.
   "Courage, hope, faith, sympathy, love, promote health and
prolong life. A contented mind, a cheerful spirit, is health to the
body and strength to the soul. . . ."
   "When temptations assail you, when care, perplexity, and
darkness seem to surround your soul, look to the place where
you last saw the light. Rest in Christ's love and under His pro-
tecting care. . . . Entering into communion with the Saviour, we
enter the region of peace. . . .
   "Nothing tends more to promote health of body and of soul
than does a spirit of gratitude and praise. It is a positive duty to
resist melancholy, discontented thoughts and feelings—as
much a duty as it is to pray. If we are heaven-bound, how can
we go as a band of mourners, groaning and complaining all
along the way to our Father's house?"—The Ministry of Healing,
pp. 241, 250, 251.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. In what area of this week's lesson do you feel you need
     the most help? Review the steps for change in Lesson 4.
   2. Review this week's Memory Text. How does following the
      principles discussed in this week's lesson give us a spirit
      of power, love, and a sound mind?
   3. How can following Christ's advice in Matthew 7:1-5 im-
      prove our life?

       Belief and Cleansing




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 18:21, 22; John 5:1-
16; Eph. 4:32; James 5:14, 15; 1 John 3:4.


     MEMORY TEXT: "Blessed is he whose transgression is
     forgiven, whose sin is covered" (Psalm 32:1).

   KEY THOUGHT: Often before we can realize physical
health, "Christ must bring relief to the mind, and cleanse the
soul from sin."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 77.

   THE WORST PROBLEM. Irene was a young widow, incon-
solable over the loss of her husband. His premature death left
her with financial difficulties, which didn't help her feelings of
rebelliousness against God. As if these obstacles weren't
enough, Irene suffered from an illness, making it difficult for
her to find work. But Irene's worst problem was feeling that
God was punishing her for a specific sin she had committed.
   When Irene discovered and began to experience the certainty
of forgiveness in Christ, it wasn't long before she was able to
work and smile again. (Adapted from Paul Tournier, The Heal-
ing of Persons [New York: Harper and Row, 1965], p. 150.)
   Last week we discussed certain principles of Christianity and
how they contribute to our physical health. This week we con-
tinue that discussion by looking at the most basic principle of
all—forgiveness.

Sunday                                               March 7
THE GREATEST DESIRE (1 John 3:4; Luke 5:17-26).
  What is sin, and how does it relate to disease? 1 John 3:4.

    Because the laws of nature are as divine as the Decalogue,
failure to observe them is as much a sin as failure to observe the
Decalogue. And the result of this failure often manifests itself in
illness. (See The Ministry of Healing, p. 113.)
   Many of the people who flocked to Christ were sick be-
cause they had not obeyed nature's laws. Read about one such
person in Luke 5:17-26. What significance is there in Jesus'
forgiving him first and healing him second?

   To Christ, "body and soul were bound up together in a liv-
ing unity. There could be no wholeness of life unless the soul
was at peace with God. Therefore he spoke directly to this
man's first and most important need: Your sins are forgiven
you, he said. When that was true, then strength and healing of
the body could follow."—The Interpreter's Bible, vol. 8, p. 106.
   "He [the sick man] longed to see Jesus, and receive the assur-
ance of forgiveness and peace with heaven."—The Ministry of
Healing, p. 74.
  How does the palsied man's desire to see Jesus contrast with
that of the Pharisees and doctors of the law (verses 17, 21)?

   In this verse doctors of the law were teachers of Jewish law
who received special schooling and passed certain examina-
tions. The Pharisees were the conservative religious sect of Ju-
daism known for their strict adherence to all religious duties
found in tradition and the Torah. Together with the doctors of
law, they interpreted and applied the law to every tiny detail
and situation in life. They had come as spies to quibble and find
fault with Jesus. The palsied man's faith shone clear and bright
against the concept of righteousness by human works.
   Think about your own life. Are you as eager to seek for-
giveness as was the palsied man? Could there be a sin in your
life that is preventing you from enjoying good health?


                                                                 77
Monday                                               March 8
"RISE AND WALK" (John 5:1-16).

   In what ways is the story in John 5:1-16 similar to the story
in Luke 5:17-26?


  Jesus "saw one case of supreme wretchedness. It was that of
a man who had been a helpless cripple for thirty-eight years.
His disease was in a great degree the result of his own evil
habits."—The Ministry of Healing, pp. 81, 82.

   Why do you think Jesus asked the invalid such an obvious
question (verse 6)? What does the invalid's reply tell us about
his situation (verse 7)?


    "It was obvious that the man desired release from his dis-
ease, but it [the question] served to turn the sufferer's attention
immediately to Jesus and to the problem of healing from his
affliction."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 949.
    The invalid's reply reflects a pathetic tale of desertion, self-
ishness, unfulfilled hope, and despair. He had no one to help
him. Others waiting to reach the pool first were apparently less
ill than he. Yet in their desire to be made well, they kicked him
aside like an old useless rag. Maybe next time. On and on. For
38 years.
    We don't know whether he knew who was standing before
him. But something about Jesus must have affected him as the
rippling waters never did, for when Jesus told him to rise and
walk, he did so immediately.
    "Every nerve and muscle thrills with new life, and healthful
action comes to his crippled limbs. Springing to his feet, he goes
on his way with firm, free step, praising God, and rejoicing in
his new-found strength."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 84.
    Before encountering Jesus, he was a "case of supreme
wretchedness." Afterward, his body thrilled with new life and
healthy action. Such is the nature of God's forgiveness.

as recorded in John 5:14?


  "Wilt thou be made whole?" is a question Jesus asks each
one of us. What story does your reply tell?

THREE STRANDS; ONE ROPE
   This week we are studying the effect forgiveness has on
one's health. In light of the two scripture passages we've stud-
ied so far (Luke 5:17-26; John 5:1-16), what can we say about
the relationship between forgiveness and faith? Must we have
faith before God can forgive us?

   Of the paralytic, Ellen White wrote, "It was Christ who had
brought conviction to his conscience when he was yet at home.
When he repented of his sins and believed in the power of Jesus to
make him whole, the mercy of the Saviour had blessed his
heart. Jesus had watched the first glimmer of faith grow into a
conviction that He was the sinner's only helper, and had seen it
grow stronger with every effort to come into His presence."
—The Ministry of Healing, p. 75 (italics supplied).
   Of the man by the pool, she says, "He might have stopped to
doubt, and thus have lost his one chance of healing. But no, he
believed Christ's word, believed that he was made whole; im-
mediately he made the effort, and God gave him the power. . . .
Acting on the word of Christ, he was made whole."—The Minis-
try of Healing, p. 84 (italics supplied).
  Note the italicized words in the quotations above. Then
write a definition of faith based on those words.

   Faith, forgiveness, and action are three strands that braid to
make one strong rope. Because of our faith, we take whatever
action is appropriate and necessary to find Christ. Faith com-
pels us to reach across the sin-eroded chasm that separates us
from God. It urges us to grasp His hand outstretched in forgive-
ness. It grants us our desire to be made whole. Faith claims
Christ's salvation now.
   "The sense of sin has poisoned the springs of life. But Christ
says, 'I will take your sins; I will give you peace.' . . . His grace
is sufficient to subdue sin. Place your hand in His, and let Him
guide you."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 85.
  Has sin poisoned the springs of your life, breaking your
health and your heart? Place your hand in Christ's now.



                                                                  79

THE GREATEST MIRACLE OF ALL (James 5:14, 15).
   How does James 5:14, 15 illustrate the hand-in-hand rela-
tionship of health and forgiveness?

    In the name of the Lord. We can be the instruments of God's
grace. God alone has the power to heal and forgive.
    "Prayer offered for any purpose is a serious undertaking, for
it implies that a man is sincerely willing to cooperate with God
and to obey all of His commandments. . . . Consequently, the
sick member cannot expect God's blessing apart from a sincere
purpose to abandon practices which may, in part at least, have
caused his illness."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 540.
    Save. In verse 15, the word save means "to rescue from de-
struction," "to heal." In answer to the prayer of faith, healing
may come about instantly or over a period of time. It may come
as a divine act of intervention transcending natural law, or as
treatment is applied. But no matter when or how healing oc-
curs, it is an answer.
    Sins. "That is, most particularly, sins which may . . . have
caused the sickness. . . . To be sincere the prayer must be accom-
panied by the confession of known sins and by the conscious
purpose, untrammeled by reservations, to align the life with the
will of God. When this is done the past departures from known
principles of healthful living are freely forgiven on the basis of
divine mercy and the sick man's determination henceforth to
live in harmony with known health principles."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 7, p. 541.
   How should we view the cases of people who followed the
instructions in James 5:14, 15 but did not recover?

   In the miracle accounts we studied this week, both people
were searching for forgiveness more than for health. And is not
forgiveness the greatest miracle of all? Perhaps, too, we could
interpret James 5:14, 15 this way: The prayer of faith will save
the sick from his or her sins. And all whose sins are forgiven
will surely be raised by the Lord in the resurrection of the just.
  How do the following verses help with this problem?
James 4:13-15; Matt. 6:10; Rom. 8:28; Luke 22:42.

INFINITE FORGIVENESS (Matt. 18:21, 22; Eph 4:32).
   Before Leonardo da Vinci began painting The Last Supper, he
had a raging confrontation with another artist. Da Vinci re-
mained so angry that he painted Judas' face to look like the
person with whom he had quarreled. But when he proceeded to
paint Christ's face, he discovered he could not do so. After sev-
eral attempts, he concluded his trouble was grounded in his
unforgiving spirit toward the model he had used for Judas.
Thus he redid the betrayer's face, after which he was able to
complete Christ's portrait. Likewise, the Holy Spirit cannot
paint the features of Christ into our lives while we are coloring
the face of another with hatred and bitterness.
   In what way do the following texts enlarge upon this prin-
ciple? Mark 11:25, 26; Eph. 4:32.

   Based on what we've learned about how positive and nega-
tive emotions influence our immune system, describe below
how forgiveness can assist us in being healthy.

   What therapeutic principle does Jesus offer in Matthew
18:21-35?

   Some Bible scholars believe that the rabbis limited the number
of times one person should forgive another to three, based on a
false interpretation of Amos 1:3. Perhaps knowing this, and being
aware that Christ always gave broader meaning to the law, Peter
asked Him how often a person should forgive another.
   Christ's answer came in two forms: (1) a symbolic number
signifying infinity, and (2) a parable that elaborates on the true
spirit of forgiveness.
   "The great lesson of the parable lies in the contrast between
God's compassion and man's hardheartedness; in the fact that
God's forgiving mercy is to be the measure of our own.
'Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy
fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?' "—Christ's Object
Lessons, p. 251.
  Are you quick to forgive? Or are you better at holding a
grudge? Is there someone you need to forgive?

                                                               81
Friday                                                March 12
FURTHER STUDY: Read 2 Chronicles 7:14; 1 John 1:9; Mat-
thew 5:39-45; Luke 6:37; 17:3, 4; Colossians 3:12, 13. Also read

   "Prayer for the sick should be offered in trust and submis-
sion, with quiet confidence in a wise heavenly Father who
knows what is best and who never makes a mistake. Every
intelligent Christian prayer of request, therefore, will include
the submissive thought, 'Thy will be done.' "—SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 7, p. 541.
   "The paralytic found in Christ healing for both the soul and
the body. He needed health of soul before he could appreciate
health of body."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 77.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. After studying this week's lesson, how would you define
     forgiveness?

     2. Can you share an experience in which you forgave some-
        one who had mistreated you? How did it make you feel?
        What did it do for the other person?

     3. What about forgiveness have you learned from this
        week's lesson?

     4. "Forgiveness is . . . a beneficent invasion. It is alert and
        patient and creative. Nor should we forget what forgive-
        ness accomplishes in the life of the forgiver."—The
        Interpreter's Bible, vol. 7, p. 476. How is forgiveness a "be-
        neficent invasion?" How is it alert, patient, and creative?
        What does it accomplish in the life of the forgiver?

     5. Forgiveness is essential to a person's health just as are
        water, fresh air, exercise, etc. Therefore, how could you
        use the steps in Lesson 4 to help yourself be more forgiv-
        ing?

SUMMARY: Forgiveness is a two-pronged principle that pre-
vents negative attitudes and emotions from ruining our health.
God's forgiveness releases us from the guilt of sin, while for-
giving others releases us from bitterness and enmity.

         A Living Offering




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ps. 8:6; 1 Cor. 9:25; Matt.
25:21.
   MEMORY TEXT: "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by
   the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living
   sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reason-
   able service" (Romans 12:1).

   KEY THOUGHT: Being healthy plays an important role in
our ability to help spread the gospel of salvation in Christ.
Therefore, managing our health is as much a part of God's
stewardship plan as managing our money, time, and talents.
   A TALE OF TWO DRINKING GLASSES. Suppose you re-
ceive as a gift a beautiful crystal glass. Despite its fragility, this
glass is quite usable. And if you care for it gently, it will last
indefinitely. However, if you're careless with it, it could easily
shatter.
   Now suppose someone gives you an equally elegant drink-
ing glass made of silver. It can endure quite a bit of abuse with-
out breaking.
   These two glasses represent two types of physical health,
either of which a person can inherit. Some may have a more
fragile constitution than others. Most of us are somewhere in
between. But all of us benefit when, in God's strength, we take
care of whatever type of health we have.
   Stewardship is the management of life. This week we'll study
how such management includes taking care of our health.
                                                                   83

GOD'S MANAGERS (Ps. 8:6; 24:1, 2).
  What two basic principles of stewardship do we find in
Genesis 1:1, 26?

  Because God created the earth, He owns it. But when He
gave dominion of the earth to Adam and Eve, He gave their
dependents the responsibility of managing it and caring for it.
Thus, we became God's stewards.
   How does Scripture affirm the Owner-steward relation-
ship? Gen. 9:2; Ps. 8:6; 24:1, 2; 50:10-12.


   After the Fall, in what new way did God lay claim to His
creation? Isa. 43:1. How did the Fall affect the purpose of
stewardship? Matt. 28:19, 20.


  After the Fall, fulfilling Christ's gospel commission became
one of the goals of stewardship.

   What areas of life does stewardship involve? How does
stewardship in each area help to spread the gospel?

     Haggai 2:8; Prov. 3:9, 10

     Ps. 90:10-12

     Matt. 25:14, 15
     Gen. 2:7; 1 Cor. 6:19, 20

  Time and talents; wealth and health. These resources that
God has entrusted to us are the stuff of which life is made. Note
how we are to recognize God's ownership of these resources.

     Deut. 5:12-14

     Mal. 3:8-10

     Rom. 12:1

     1 Cor. 12:27-31

TO THE GLORY OF HIS NAME ( 1 Cor. 9:25).
  Summarize the principles of stewardship discussed in
Sunday's lesson.

   "There are many who in their hearts charge God with being
a hard master because He claims their possessions and their
service. But we can bring to God nothing that is not already His.
'All things come of thee,' said King David; 'and of thine own
have we given thee.' 1 Chron. 29:14. All things are God's, not
only by creation, but by redemption. All the blessings of this life
and of the life to come are delivered to us stamped with the
cross of Calvary."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 362.
   What an exciting responsibility it is to manage faithfully all
the blessings God has given us! And one of these blessings is a
healthy body, the only medium through which God can com-
municate with us.
   Recognition of God's ownership of our bodies by creation
and by redemption calls for what kind of response? 1 Cor.
9:25.

   Maintaining physical health is a serious stewardship respon-
sibility. Christians are obligated to live mentally, physically,
and spiritually as their Creator and Redeemer directs, to the
glory of His name, not to the gratification of fleshly desires.
Good health contributes to clear thinking for the correct dis-
cernment of truth, and helps a person to be more effective in
working for the Lord.
   Good health is partly a result of knowing what causes illness
and of realizing that we should live according to that knowl-
edge. "The light God has given on health reform is for our
salvation and the salvation of the world. Men and women
should be informed in regard to the human habitation, fitted up
by our Creator as His dwelling place, and over which He de-
sires us to be faithful stewards."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 136.
  The two great principles of stewardship are God's owner-
ship and our management. What effect will these principles
have when you apply them to managing your health?



                                                                85
Tuesday                                          March 16
"YE SHALL WALK" (Deut. 5:33).

   How does God's promise in Deuteronomy 5:33 relate to our
stewardship responsibilities? What laws are included in the
phrase "ye shall walk in all the ways"? (Review Lesson 2,
Sunday.)


  "Prolong your days. The blessing of God is conditional upon
obedience to His precepts . . . because cooperation with eternal
principles naturally tends to 'prolong' life. Furthermore, occu-
pation of the Promised Land was conditional upon their contin-
ued loyalty. Their right to Canaan was based exclusively on the
provisions of the covenant. Should they violate its require-
ments, they would forfeit their right to that land."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 1, p. 973.

   In what way does proper management of our health ex-
press "continued loyalty" to God? How does improper stew-
ardship regarding health jeopardize our right to citizenship in
the heavenly Canaan?


   Preserving length of life. Treating the body unwisely short-
ens the time in which God means for us to work for Him. Form-
ing wrong habits, keeping late hours, and gratifying the appetite
at the expense of one's health robs us of the stamina we need to
participate in fulfillment of the gospel commission. "Those who
thus shorten their lives by disregarding nature's laws are guilty
of robbery toward God. We have no right to neglect or misuse the
body, the mind, or the strength, which should be used to offer
God consecrated service."—Counsels on Health, p. 41.

    God's amazing creation. Although the body can be com-
pared to a machine, it is far more amazing. Each day the body
wears out and replaces approximately 2 billion cells. Every 15
to 30 days, the body replaces the outer layer of skin.
    The heart and kidneys work continuously. The heart of a
70-year-old has pumped at least 46 million gallons (174 million
liters) of blood.

  What are you doing to help prolong the days of God's
amazing creation? Is there anything you would like to be
doing but are not? Ask God to help you follow the steps in
Lesson 4.

A GOOD AND FAITHFUL SERVANT (Matt. 25:14-30).

  What does God require of us as managers of life's re-
sources? What does He require regarding stewardship of the
body? Luke 12:47, 48; 1 Cor. 4:2; 10:31; Rom. 12:1; 14:12.


   Careful management of life's resources—including health—
is one way of honoring our Creator and Redeemer. As we share
our wealth—be it money, possessions, ability, or enabling
health—others will see Christ's love in action.

  What does Jesus teach about stewardship accountability in
Matthew 25:14-30? What does this parable teach us about the
purpose of stewardship?


   Jesus makes it clear that we are not to neglect, abandon, or
waste God's gifts. We are to use them wisely, applying good
judgment about His intentions whenever specific instructions
are lacking. When we do this, we will not fear being called to
account.

   "Enter thou into the joy of thy lord." We can experience the
joy of service in this world. But our joy will be complete when
in heaven we meet those who, because of our faithful steward-
ship, were impressed to commit their lives to Christ. (See
Christ's Object Lessons, p. 361.)

  List ways you believe health stewardship can impress
others to follow Christ.


   "The misuse of our physical powers . . . unfits us to accom-
plish the work God has given us to do. . . .
   "The physical life is to be carefully preserved and developed
that through humanity the divine nature may be revealed in its
fullness."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 346-348.

   Are you a good steward concerning weight control, exer-
cise, sleep, etc.? How would better health help you to be a
better steward in other areas?

"YOUR REASONABLE SERVICE" (Rom. 12:1, 2).

   To conclude our lesson on this topic, let's take an in-depth
look at our Memory Text.

  According to Paul, what is it that motivates us to practice
health stewardship? Rom. 12:1.


  God's mercies are abundant. But we witness His most tender
mercy in Christ, as He hangs upon our cross, suffering for and
because of our sins.

   Why does Paul first urge us to consecrate our bodies to the
Lord before he calls us to dedicate our intellectual and spir-
itual faculties to Him (verse 2)?


   "To a large degree the condition of the mind and soul de-
pends upon the condition of the body. Therefore, it is essential
that the physical powers be kept in the best possible health and
vigor. Any harmful practice or selfish indulgence that lessens
physical strength makes it more difficult for us to develop men-
tally and spiritually."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 615.

   What does Paul mean in verse 1 by "your reasonable
service"?


   Proper money management enables us to worship God with
our tithes and offerings. Likewise, proper health management
enables us to perform "an act of spiritual worship by offering to
God a holy and healthy body, along with a consecrated mind
and heart. . . . It is an act of religious service to preserve the
physical powers in the best possible condition. The reason is
that the Christian glorifies God in his body (1 Cor. 6:20; cf.
1 Cor. 10:31) by serving as a living example of God's saving
grace and by participating with increased strength and vigor in
the work of spreading the gospel."—SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 6, p. 616.

   In the quotation directly above, underline the phrase that
states why Christians desire to manage well all of life's re-
sources, including health.

FURTHER STUDY: Read Proverbs 9:10, 11; Romans 6:13.
Read Christ's Object Lessons, "Talents," pp. 325-365. As you do
so, relate what you read to health stewardship.
   'Those who will keep themselves from the defilement of ap-
petite and passion may become partakers of the divine nature.
Their perceptions will be clear. . . . The Lord can use them: for
they understand the words of the great apostle, 'I beseech you,
therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your
bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is
your reasonable service.' "—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 1105, on Ex. 20:3.
   "Consider God's gift of health. As stewards, we are expected
to preserve that gift with every resource available to us. Health
is always subject to assault by factors over which we have no
control. Yet we can control most of the influences that today
cause degenerative disease and premature death. Responsible
stewardship of health means choosing to exercise that con-
trol."—Richard E. Ecker, Staying Well (Downers Grove, Ill.:
InterVarsity Press, 1984), p. 27.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. As Christians, we are stewards of the earth and our bod-
     ies. What environmental conditions in your part of the
     world might affect health? How can Christians work to
     remedy these conditions?
   2. Review the tale of two drinking glasses in Sabbath's les-
      son. To which glass is your health most similar? If it is
      similar to the crystal glass, what can you do, with God's
      help, to improve it?
   3. If your health is poor through no fault of your own, does
      this mean you cannot be a good steward of your body?
      Does it mean your witness for God might not be as effec-
      tive as that of someone who is healthier?
SUMMARY: Managing our health is as much a part of Chris-
tian stewardship as managing life's other resources. One of the
goals of proper stewardship in any area of life is to spread the
gospel. A healthy body enables us to spread the gospel in two
ways: (1) A healthy body reflects Christ's glory; (2) A healthy
body gives us the strength to use our other talents for God.

                     "Go Ye"




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Rev. 14:9-12; Acts 8:5-8;
Matt. 9:35; 25:31-40; Luke 10:30-37; Ps. 67:1, 2.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations,
     baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
     and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all
     things whatsoever I have commanded you" (Matthew
     28:19, 20).

   KEY THOUGHT: "It is the Lord's design that the restoring in-
fluence of health reform shall be a part of the last great effort to
proclaim the gospel message."—Counsels on Diet and Foods, p. 75.

   ALL ABOARD! This quarter we have taken a tour, so to
speak, of the unique health message God offers. We began by
viewing this message as part of God's plan of restoration, and
from there we toured through the Bible to see how God im-
plemented the message anew for both the Israelites and the
Seventh-day Adventist Church. As our tour progressed, we
studied the natural remedies God gives in order that we may be
healthier. We also observed certain principles of Christianity
that foster a healthy immune system.
   Because we have received a special message to be shared
with the world, it is fitting that we end our tour with a lesson
on sharing this message. We will do so in the setting of the
gospel commission (Matt. 28:19, 20) and the three angels' mes-
sages (Rev. 14:6-12). As you study, be thinking of ways you
personally can help spread the good news.

"HERE ARE THEY" (Rev. 14:9-12).

  Because the body is the only medium through which God
can communicate with us, Satan has devised carefully studied
methods to weaken it. Then we will not be able to discern God's
will for our lives and live accordingly. That is why God is so
eager for us to follow, with His help, the laws that govern
health. And that is why the third angel's message includes the
message of health reform.

  Review the three angels' messages in Revelation 14:6-12.
Summarize the third angel's message below.


   The pioneers of the Seventh-day Adventist Church called the
three angels' messages "present truth," that is, truth for the
present time—the last and final times of the world. (See 2 Peter
1:12.) Reduced to its simplest form, the third angel's message
becomes "the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus."
This is the expression that represents the life and substance of
the message committed to Seventh-day Adventists.
   "The proclamation of the third angel's message . . . is the
burden of our work. The message is to be proclaimed with a
loud cry, and is to go to the whole world. The presentation of
health principles must be united with this message."—Counsels
on Diet and Foods, p. 75.
   The health-reform message is associated with the third
angel's message because it equips God's children with strength
of mind and body to live and preach the truth in times of great
stress. It is also a message that will attract others to Christ and
prepare them for His second coming. As such, it focuses upon
Christ's work of redemption of the whole person. While we
wait for the full redemption of all creation, Christians may on
this earth enjoy blessings of improved physical and emotional
health through careful attention to biblical instruction on
health.

   How does Matthew 10:7, 8 define the gospel commission?


   Matthew, Mark, Luke, and the other disciples live only

ples. How can you personalize and apply Matthew 10:7, 8?

OUTSTRETCHED HANDS, OUTSTRETCHED LIVES (Matt.
9:35; 20:34).

   How did Christ utilize a ministry of healing in His "effort
to proclaim the gospel message" (Counsels on Diet and Foods,
p. 75)? Matt. 9:35.


   "Where He [Jesus] had passed, the objects of His compassion
were rejoicing in health, and making trial of their new-found
powers. Crowds were collecting around them to hear from their
lips the works that the Lord had wrought."—The Ministry of
Healing, p. 19.

   How can we make "the restoring influence of health
reform" a part of our individual and corporate "effort to pro-
claim the gospel message"? If we are just as interested in the
welfare of others as Jesus is, what problems concerning
church growth would we eliminate? How can we develop this
concern? (See James 4:7, 8.)


   What motivated Christ in His ministry of healing? Matt.
20:34; Mark 1:41.


   He touched him. "This action was an expression of Jesus'
spontaneous sympathy and compassion. It is also an expression
of what we meet again and again in the gospel narratives, the
fact that nothing less than a personal touch with the person in
need would satisfy Jesus. . . . It was the physical expression and
accompaniment of the giving of his heart and mind and power
in personal contact. . . .
   "There is no adequate substitute for outstretched hands and
outstretched lives. No committee or organization can supplant
them. Without them, the nerve of compassion atrophies. The
word of love, which was in Jesus, must become flesh and dwell
among men."—The Interpreter's Bible, vol. 7, p. 667.

  Has your nerve of compassion become numb from disuse?
How can you begin sharing the good news about Jesus? How
can the truths you understand about health help you to share
Christianity? to share the Christ-centered truths given to
Seventh-day Adventists?

USE IT! (Luke 10:30-37).
  What can we learn about the "restoring influence" of
health ministry from Luke 10:30-37?

   The good Samaritan undoubtedly did not have Luke's medi-
cal training. Nevertheless Luke wrote his story approvingly. He
used the simple healing means within his reach and in-
convenienced himself to help a person in need. What was his
motive? Luke does not say it was to convert the Jewish man to
Samaritanism. And the story plainly shows that he was not
looking for reward or even for repayment. It tells us only that
he acted from his compassion.
   Go, and do thou likewise. Jesus clearly believed this man's
actions are an example He wants all His disciples of all ages to
follow. Actually, He commands it: You go and do the same.
   "The good Samaritan is not trying to do his duty. The point
is that he is not aware of duty at all—any more than we are
aware of duty when we act generously toward ourselves. We
act so toward ourselves because we want to; so the Samaritan
acts toward the stranger. He loves his neighbor as he loves
himself."—The Interpreter's Bible, vol. 8, p. 197.
  How does a personal or corporate health ministry fulfill the
command to love your neighbor as yourself?

  Read 2 Kings 4:32-35; 5:1-4, 10; Acts 3:4-8; 28:8, 9; Colossians
4:14. Who are these verses telling us about, and what was
unique about each person's health ministry? What did these
persons have in common regarding their health ministry?

   The little maid "did not hide her faith in God; she used it.
And let anyone today, however humble he may be, have faith
in God and declare it to one in physical or moral need and he
too may bring like miracles to pass."—The Interpreter's Bible, vol.
3, p. 210.
  In what ways have you fulfilled the command "Go, and do
thou likewise"?

                                                                93

IN CHRIST'S FOOTSTEPS (Matt. 25:31-40).

  What does Matthew 25:3140 suggest about the relationship
between fulfilling the needs of others and God's final judg-
ment?


  The basis of God's judgment may be a shock to some of us
who have settled comfortably into myopic rituals or routines.
He will not ask us about our creed, worship, or position in the
church community. Instead, He will want to know how well
our lives exemplified the aspects of true religion as James 1:27
describes it.

   Sick and ye visited me. The word translated "visited" also
implies "to care for" or "to look after." This implies a true
sacrifice of our time and self-pleasure.

   List ways you can think of to look after someone who is
sick, handicapped, or widowed. Consider the time involved
with each idea and the fact that spending time this way will
keep you from doing something else.


   "Those whom Christ commends in the judgment may have
known little of theology, but they have cherished His princi-
ples. Through the influence of the divine Spirit they have been
a blessing to those about them. . . .
   "Many feel that it would be a great privilege to visit the
scenes of Christ's life on earth. . . . But we need not go to
Nazareth, to Capernaum, or to Bethany, in order to walk in the
steps of Jesus. We shall find His footprints beside the sickbed, in
the hovels of poverty, in the crowded alleys of the great city,
and in every place where there are human hearts in need of
consolation. In doing as Jesus did when on earth, we shall walk
in His steps. . . .
   "To every soul a trust is given. Of everyone the Chief Shep-
herd will demand, 'Where is the flock that was given thee, thy
beautiful flock?' "—The Desire of Ages, pp. 638-641.

   How well does your life exemplify the aspects of true reli-
gion described in James 1:27? If you desire to do more for
others, ask God to open your heart to the needs around you
and give to you the power to make a difference in someone's
life.

THE RIGHT ARM (Ps. 67:1, 2; Luke 10:1, 8, 9; Acts 8:5-8).

   With what words does the psalmist express the calling of
all Christians? Ps. 67:1, 2.


  Saving health. "Usually translated 'salvation'; but also ren-
dered 'welfare' (Job 30:15); 'help' (Ps. 3:2; 42:5); 'deliverance'
(Ps. 18:50 . . .); 'helping' (Ps. 22:1); and 'health' (Ps. 41.11)."
—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 787.

   Among all nations. In essence, Psalm 67:1, 2 is the Old Testa-
ment counterpart of Matthew 28:19, 20. The church's responsibility
is to bring the knowledge of salvation to all nations. Part of that
knowledge indudes the answer to the question Why be healthy?

   Read Luke 10:1, 8, 9. Why did Christ instruct these 70 dis-
ciples to tell the healed that the kingdom of God had come?
(See Isa. 42:6, 7; Luke 4:16-20.)


  Imagine the scenes described in Acts 8:5-8. Do you think
the people were joyful for reasons other than that they were
healed physically?


   "It is the divine plan that we shall work as the disciples
worked. Physical healing is bound up with the gospel commis-
sion."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 141.

   Why do you suppose "the medical missionary work is to be
to the work of the church as the right arm to the body?"—Tes-
timonies, vol. 8, p. 77.


   There are many people who never consider going to church
or listening to religious services on the radio or television. Often
assistance with the relief of their physical needs is the only way
we can approach them as messengers and servants of God.

  How can you personally approach such persons? What
methods or programs has the Seventh-day Adventist Church
developed to reach them? How long has it been since you or
your church has participated in such efforts?

                                                                 95
Friday                                            March 26
FURTHER STUDY: Read Isaiah 35:1-6 and Psalm 146. Also
read "The Least of These My Brethren" in The Desire of Ages,
pp. 637-641; and "Teaching and Healing" in The Ministry of
Healing, pp. 139-160.
   "Medical missionary work brings to humanity the gospel of
release from suffering. It is the pioneer work of the gospel. It is
the gospel practiced, the compassion of Christ revealed. . . .
   "Read the Scriptures carefully, and you will find that
Christ spent the largest part of His ministry in restoring the
suffering and afflicted to health. Thus He threw back upon
Satan the reproach of the evil which the enemy of all good
had originated. Satan is the destroyer; Christ is the restorer.
And in our work as Christ's colaborers, we shall have suc-
cess if we work on practical lines. Ministers, do not confine
your work to giving Bible instruction. Do practical work.
Seek to restore the sick to health. This is true ministry. Re-
member that the restoration of the body prepares the way for
the restoration of the soul."—Medical Ministry, pp. 239, 240.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. After studying this quarter about the unique Seventh-day
     Adventist approach to living a more healthy life, would
     you be able to summarize the main points to an interested
     friend?

     2. Other religions, including the New Age, promote health-
        ful lifestyles. What makes the Seventh-day Adventist
        health message more appealing, and how could you pres-
        ent the Adventist viewpoint to a member of one of these
        religions?

     3. Your neighbor has made a point of telling you that she
        wants nothing to do with religion. Just about the same
        time that she expresses a desire to quit smoking, your
        church decides to conduct its next stop-smoking clinic.
        Should you tell her about it? How?

SUMMARY: Our greatest privilege is to share the gospel with
others. Sharing a healing ministry is the commission and high
calling of us all. At this time in history, when the near arrival
of the kingdom of glory is announced, such a ministry should
again characterize Christ's missionaries at home and abroad.

      Lessons for Second Quarter, 1993
   Sabbath School members who have not received a copy of the adult
Sabbath School lessons for the second quarter of 1993 will be helped by
the following outline in studying the first two lessons. This quarter's
lessons cover the book of Job.

First Lesson: Why Blame God?
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Job 1:1-5, 13-22; 2:7-13;
42:10-17.
MEMORY TEXT: Job 1:21
   KEY THOUGHT: How should believers in God relate to the problem
of suffering? The book of Job helps us find God's answer to this universal
question.
   FURTHER STUDY: What do the following Bible passages teach
regarding the attitude we should adopt in times of suffering and trial?
Deut. 8:5; Prov. 3:11, 12; Isa. 48:10; 1 Peter 1:7; 1 Peter 4:12, 13. Read from
The Ministry of Healing, "Mind Cure," pp. 241-259.

Second Lesson: The Adversary
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Job 1:6-12, 21, 22; 2:1-7, 10.
MEMORY TEXT: 1 Peter 5:8
   KEY THOUGHT: Evil and misery exist in a universe controlled by
a God of love, because an enemy has arisen who is the cause of all that
is wrong.
   FURTHER STUDY: What is the relationship between Revelation
12:7-9 and the rest of chapter 12? Why did John introduce the casting of
Satan out of heaven in the context of a discussion of the work of the
"dragon" in the Christian Era? What has Satan been given permission
to do to God's people throughout the ages? Has the Lord imposed
restraints upon him? In what ways will Satan's attack on the last-day
church be similar to his attack on Job? Read "The Origin of Evil" in The
Great Controversy, pp. 492-504.
