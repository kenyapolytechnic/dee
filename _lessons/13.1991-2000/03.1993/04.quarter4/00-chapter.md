The Sabbath School Lesson Video
          See what you've been missing!
   Educators have long known the power of visual aids. Jesus Himself often
used the objects of the visual world to teach His spiritual lessons effectively.
   Now this tremendous combination of the word spoken and the word seen is
available through the new adult Sabbath School theme videos.
   Professionally produced by the Church Ministries department, these videos
are a special blessing to Sabbath School students, shut-ins, small groups, and
isolated members.

    Available each quarter from your Adventist Book Center.

              God's Builders
 Messages from Ezra and Nehemiah
   Political plots, social and economic unrest. Headlines from
today's newspaper? Yes. But they also describe events in the
books of Ezra and Nehemiah. These books also tell of brave
Jewish patriots who faced huge obstacles. Through prayer and
grace they reestablished the remnant of Israel as a group dedi-
cated to fulfilling God's will for them. Their courage and re-
solve have a message for the "remnant" church today.
   The common theme that runs through Ezra and Nehemiah
(considered one book by the Jews) is "building." Zerubbabel
labored to build a temple. Nehemiah restored a city's walls and
gates. Ezra and Nehemiah reestablished Israel as a theocracy.
This common theme of "building" touches upon other themes,
including revival, obedience to God's law, prayer, church unity,
and leadership.
   During the times of Ezra and Nehemiah the political struc-
tures of the Near East tumbled; Babylonian might crumbled
before the victorious armies of Cyrus. The bonds of exile sud-
denly dropped away as Persian kings permitted God's people
to return to Jerusalem and rebuild their temple, capital, and
political economy.
    "Although the double book Ezra-Nehemiah does not claim
to have been written in its entirety by Ezra, there is nothing in it
which could not have been written by him."—SDA Bible Com-
 mentary, vol. 3, p. 319. Because Ezra was a scribe, it would not
 have been unusual for him to preserve for posterity the far-
 reaching events of his time.

Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ezra 2:1, 2; 3:8; 7:6, 11;
Neh. 1:11; 5:14; 8:1, 2; Dan. 8:2-4, 20; Haggai 1:1.
    MEMORY TEXT: "I heard the voice of the Lord, saying,
    Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I,
    Here am I; send me" (Isaiah 6:8).

  KEY QUESTIONS: Who is a builder for God? Why can
ordinary persons do great deeds for God and others?

   TRUE BUILDERS. In 1976, an earthquake devastated Gua-
temala City, leaving thousands of children without families.
At the request of Elder Robert Folkenberg, then president of
the Adventist work in Central America, Ken and Alcyon Fleck
organized an orphanage. "After visiting Guatemala, . . . Alcyon
Fleck concluded that 'there were so many starving, lonely
children, I just couldn't leave them all there with no hope for
the future.' "—Mission (first quarter, 1992), p. 19. Since then,
the Flecks' organization, International Children's Care, has
established orphanages in the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica,
Honduras, Mexico, and Romania. The Flecks are true builders
for God.
   In our lesson this week we will study the characteristics of
several persons who were great builders for God—persons
who led captive Israel out of Babylonian captivity, then as-
sisted in the reconstruction of God's remnant people.

PANORAMA OF THE PERSIAN PERIOD (Dan. 8:2-4, 20).

   Read the visions recorded in Daniel 2:32, 37-39; 7:5; and
8:2-4. These visions indicated that the kingdom succeeding
Babylon would be a combination of two political powers: the
Medes and the Persians. The bear, raising itself on one side,
and the two horns of the ram, one higher than the other,
symbolized this dual nature. The prophecy forecast the even-
tual dominance of Persia. Read in Daniel 5:1, 5, 24-28, 30 how
Belshazzar was informed about the collapse of Babylon to the
Medes and Persians.
   "In that last night of mad folly, Belshazzar and his lords
had filled up the measure of their guilt and the guilt of the
Chaldean kingdom."—Prophets and Kings, p. 530.

   What remarkable prophecy, written 150 years earlier, was
fulfilled on the night Babylon fell, thus preparing the way
for the revival of the Jewish nation? Isa. 44:27, 28; 45:1-5; see
also Jer. 51:30-32.


    The Greek historians Herodotus and Xenophon state that
the armies of Cyrus changed the flow of the Euphrates River
so that his troops could enter Babylon on the old river bed.
The river gates, being open because of the night's festivities,
permitted the attackers to enter the city without opposition.
    Seven books of the Bible either refer to the first five or six
emperors of the Persian Empire or focus on the experience of
God's people during their rule (Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther,
Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi). While these scriptures cover the
experiences of Israel during the 100 years following their
return from captivity, the Persian Empire itself lasted for a
little over 200 years. Surely this empire had an important part
in God's plan to prepare the world for the Messiah's coming.

  What similarities for the spread of the gospel do you see
between the fall of ancient Babylon and the present politi-
cal climate of Eastern Europe and China?


  When world affairs seem out of control, why is it good to
recall such prophecies as Daniel 8:2-4 and Jeremiah 51:30,
31?



                                                                 7
Monday                                    September 27
ZERUBBABEL: TEMPLE BUILDER (Ezra 3:8).
  Old Testament prophets compared the exodus from Babylon
with the Exodus from Egypt (Isa. 11:11, 12, 16). Look for these
similarities as you continue your study.
  Whom did Cyrus, the Persian king, appoint as governor
over the Jews, charging him to rebuild the temple? Ezra
5:13-16. Why might the king have chosen him?
   Most Bible references acknowledge Zerubbabel as gover-
nor and builder of the temple (Haggai 1:1; 2:21). The name
Sheshbazzar is probably a name by which he was known to
the Babylonians and Persians. Remember that Daniel's cap-
tors gave him and his companions other names (Dan. 1:7). A
"prince of Judah," Zerubbabel was a grandson of Jehoiachin
(Jeconiah), the king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar took
into captivity after only three months on the throne in 597
B.C. (1 Chron. 3:17-19; 2 Kings 24:8-16).
   Cyrus probably chose Zerubbabel with the thought that the
Jews would rally around a "prince of the blood." But we have
no reason to think that he was a man of great wealth or
extraordinary ability. After all, he was an exile of a defunct
nation. Yet he must have enjoyed the confidence of his kins-
men in captivity. They would have respected him as a descen-
dant of the old Jewish nobility and the Davidic house.
   What major tasks did Cyrus give to Zerubbabel? Ezra
5:13-16.
    God appointed Moses, Aaron, and Miriam (Micah 6:4) to
lead Israel from Egypt to Canaan. In Israel's second exodus
(from Babylon), Zerubbabel, the governor, and Joshua, the
high priest, led out in a similar manner. Assisted by 10 others
(Ezra 2:2), Zerubbabel organized nearly 50,000 persons and
more than 8,000 animals to travel from Babylon to Judah (Ezra
2:64-67), a trek that took four months. And just as Moses and
the Israelites built the sanctuary, so did Zerubbabel and the
exiles from Babylon rebuild the temple.
   How are you a prince or princess of the blood? (See Eph
1:3-5.) Can God depend upon you as He depended upon
Zerubbabel?

Tuesday                                  September 28
JOSHUA: HIGH PRIEST AND INTERCESSOR (Ezra 2:2;
Haggai 1:1).
  Joshua, Zerubbabel's associate, was another of God's timely
"builders." What claim did he have to his position? Ezra 3:2;
Haggai 1:1; 1 Chron. 6:3-15.

   Joshua traced his lineage back to Aaron through Aaron's
son Eleazar. Cyrus evidently chose Joshua to be the high
priest of the new temple, since he was the legitimate person
for the office according to Mosaic law.
   What assurance did God give Joshua and the returned
exiles in response to Joshua's prayers on behalf of the na-
tion? Zech. 3:1-7.

   "As the intercession of Joshua is accepted, the command is
given, 'Take away the filthy garments from him;' and to Joshua
the Angel says, 'Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass
from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.' So
they set a fair miter upon his head, and clothed him with
garments.' . . . His own sins and those of his people were
pardoned. Israel was clothed with 'change of raiment'—the
righteousness of Christ imputed to them. The miter placed
upon Joshua's head was such as were worn by the priests, and
bore the inscription, 'Holiness to the Lord,' signifying that
notwithstanding his former transgressions, he was now quali-
fied to minister before God in His sanctuary."—Prophets and
Kings, p. 584.
   Local opposition from the Samaritans and political opposi-
tion in the empire hindered the work on the temple until it
stopped altogether. In discouragement the people turned to
their own interests for sixteen years (Haggai 1:2-4).
  What finally aroused Joshua and Zerubbabel to encour-
age the people to return to their work on the Lord's temple?
Ezra 5:1, 2 (compare Haggai 1:1-8, 12; Zech. 4:1-10).

   Joshua and Zerubbabel willingly responded to the coun-
sels of the prophets. Likewise, God has given us counsels and
encouragement through the prophet Ellen White. How has
this gift assisted you in your relationship with the Saviour?

EZRA: PRIEST AND SCRIBE OF THE LAW (Ezra 7:6, 11).

   About 80 years after the first group of Jews had returned to
Judah under the leadership of Zerubbabel and Joshua, Ezra
led a second migration estimated to have numbered about
8,000.

   How does Ezra identify himself and his work? Ezra 7:1-5,
11.


   "Born of the sons of Aaron, Ezra had been given a priestly
training; and in addition to this he had acquired a familiarity
with the writings of the magicians, the astrologers, and the
wise men of the Medo-Persian realm. But he was not satisfied
with his spiritual condition. He longed to be in full harmony
with God; he longed for wisdom to carry out the divine will.
And so he 'prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord, and
to do it.'. . . Ezra's heart was stirred. He experienced a new
and thorough conversion, and determined to master the records
of sacred history that he might use this knowledge to bring
blessing and light to his people."—Prophets and Kings, p. 608.

  How did Ezra begin to make the Word of God a promi-
nent force in the life of the emerging nation? Neh. 8:1-3.


    "What is strikingly apparent is the royal reception given to
the Word of God. This day was to prove a turning-point.
From now on the Israelites would be predominantly 'the people
of a book.' At the dedication of Solomon's Temple there had
been glory and beauty, natural and supernatural, to over-
whelm the worshippers. Here the focus, apart from a wooden
platform, was a scroll—or more exactly, what was written in
it. Its opening brought the people to their feet."—Derek Kidner,
Ezra & Nehemiah, Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries
(Downers Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press, 1979), pp. 105, 106.

   The greatness of Ezra's influence lay in his passion foi
studying God's Word so he would know his Lord. List some
factors that help us develop a hunger for Bible study. Iden-
tify some things that take away our desire for the Word.

NEHEMIAH: GOVERNOR AND KING'S HELPER (Neh. 1:11;
5:14).

   Twelve or 13 years after Ezra arrived in Jerusalem, the new
Persian king, Artaxerxes I, appointed Nehemiah as governor
of Judah (Neh. 5:14).

  What did Nehemiah do in the king's court? Neh. 1:11.


   According to Herodotus, the Greek historian, the office of
cupbearer was a great honor. It was the responsibility of this
officer to protect the monarch from being poisoned. That
Nehemiah was the king's cupbearer indicates that he was a
man of integrity. In God's providence, both Ezra and Nehemiah
were trained in the court of Persia for their major roles in
reestablishing God's people in Judah.

   What admirable characteristics of Nehemiah can you iden-
tify? Neh. 1:3, 4, 11; 2:17.


    Nehemiah was a man of deep piety who grieved for the
plight of God's people in Jerusalem. But this grief did not
cause him to act without thinking. Having considered all the
options, he carefully laid his plans."
   "As important as the news itself is the manner of Nehemiah's
reaction to it. Despite having the ear of the king, and the fact
that . . . he himself is by disposition a man of action, he turns
first to God and to prayer."—J. G. McConville, Ezra, Nehemiah,
and Esther (Edinburgh, Scotland: The Saint Andrew Press,
1985), p. 75.

  How do you react to troubling news or situations? Do you
pray immediately? Of what advantage would prayer be in
such circumstances?


   "To pray as Nehemiah prayed in his hour of need is a
resource at the command of the Christian. . . . In every cir-
cumstance, under every condition, the soul weighed down
with grief and care, or fiercely assailed by temptation, may
find assurance, support, and succor in the unfailing love and
power of a covenant-keeping God."—Prophets and Kings, pp.
631, 632.

                                                              11
Friday                                            October 1
FURTHER STUDY: This week we saw that God has builders
to match the times. Read Genesis 6:13, 14, 22; Luke 1:26-38;
Acts 8:26-40. (1) In each set of texts, who is the "builder"? (2)
What made him/her a "builder" for God? (3) What traits of
Zerubbabel, Joshua, Ezra, and Nehemiah did each display?
   Read "Not by Might, nor by Power" in Prophets and Kings,
pp. 593-597.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Do you see things that need to change in your church?
     How can you accomplish this as Nehemiah did without
     being abrasive and harsh?

     2. Recite this week's Memory Text. When the Lord asks,
        "Whom shall I send?" are you quick to respond, "Send
        me"? How can you be a builder for God?

SUMMARY: God has His "builders." Humble, sensitive to
the counsels of the prophetic gift, deep students of the Word,
persons of faith, earnest prayer, and action, God's builders
from all walks of life hear His call in the great needs of His
people and give of themselves wholeheartedly to meet the
challenges.

               Going Home




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ezra 1, 2.

  MEMORY TEXT: "When the Lord turned again the cap-
  tivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. Then was
  our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with sing-
  ing" (Psalm 126:1, 2).

   KEY QUESTION: Permission to return to Judah surprised
and excited the exiles, yet only a minority actually went home.
Likewise, God's people will be delirious with happiness when
Jesus appears in glory. What preparation is necessary for you
to take part in heaven's homecoming?

   A DREAM COME TRUE. On November 12, 1989, a crane
yanked sections of concrete out of the Berlin Wall as a dentist
extracts decayed teeth. Minutes later, Bernd and Cornelia
Platt from East Germany walked through the gap. "It's like
realizing a dream," Bernd said. Yet with the freedom to move
now a real choice, these young professionals decided to con-
tinue living where they had been. The security of home and
jobs kept them from moving.
   When the winds of strife brought immense changes in the
Near East in 539 B.C., the Jewish exiles suddenly found them-
selves able to return to Judah. Most, however, chose to re-
main in Babylon because they had grown comfortable in their

to make the dream of returning home come true.

PRAYER PREPARATION (Dan. 9:1-19).

   Daniel's name does not appear in the books of Ezra and
Nehemiah, but therein we may trace his fingerprints. Above
all, his earnest, intercessory prayers pervade the records of
Ezra 1.

  How did the onset of the Medo-Persian kingdom affect
Daniel? Dan. 9:1-3 (see also Jer. 29:10-14).


   Daniel and his Hebrew friends often must have pondered
Israel's destiny. How could they tell others about the Messiah
while those others were still apostatizing? How could Jerusa-
lem become their missionary center while they were still in
captivity? Daniel himself was in the first group of captives
taken to Babylon (605 B.C.), and the ascension of Darius the
Mede to the former throne of Babylon prompted him to restudy
Jeremiah's prophecies.

   What was the substance of Daniel's prayer? Dan. 9:4-15,
20.


   Daniel was not a priest, "but it is one of the glories of
Scripture that no special permission is required for interces-
sion on behalf of others. . . . Thanks to the study of 'the books'
and the habit of prayer three times a day, . . . the instructed
Jew was not at a loss when he came to put his prayer into
words."—Joyce G. Baldwin, Daniel, Tyndale Old Testament
Commentaries (Downers Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press, 1978),
p. 165.

   Why did Daniel earnestly desire God to honor His prom-
ise to restore Israel after 70 years? Dan. 9:18, 19.


   Daniel expresses no selfish interest in his prayer. His con-
cern is for the honor of God. Even though the sinful people of
Israel have brought reproach and embarrassment upon the
nation, it is really the true God they have dishonored before
the pagan world.

  Are you in a situation that is holding you captive? How
can Israel's captivity and release help you?

PERSIAN PERMISSION (Ezra 1:1-4).
   Although Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon in 539 B.C.,
he remained the power behind the throne of Darius the Mede
for more than a year. He issued his decree for the Jews to
rebuild the temple at Jerusalem in the summer of 537 B.C.
  What motivated Cyrus to issue this proclamation? What
evidence is there that someone had shown Isaiah's proph-
ecy to the king? Ezra 1:1, 2; Isa. 44:24-28; 45:1-5, 13.

   In his proclamation, Cyrus acknowledged that Yahweh had
charged him to build His temple at Jerusalem. Such a charge
appears only in the prophecy of Isaiah. A person who had a
scroll of Isaiah and who had intimate access to the king prob-
ably showed Cyrus the divine message. Thus in Cyrus' decree
we may see the traces of Daniel's influence.
  What event during the reign of Darius the Mede opened a
door for Daniel to reach Cyrus? Daniel 6.

   "The deliverance of Daniel from the den of lions had been
used of God to create a favorable impression upon the mind
of Cyrus the Great. The sterling qualities of the man of God as
a statesman of farseeing ability led the Persian ruler to show
him marked respect and to honor his judgment."—Prophets
and Kings, p. 557.
   Scholars used to question the validity of Cyrus' decree.
They found it difficult to believe that he would take such an
interest in an insignificant captive nation. But an archeologi-
cal discovery tells us this in Cyrus' own words: "I returned to
these sacred cities on the other side of the Tigris, the sanctu-
aries of which have been in ruins for a long time, the images
which used to live in them, and I established for them perma-
nent sanctuaries. I also gathered all their former inhabitants
and returned to them their habitations."—"Cyrus Cylinder,"
The Biblical World (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Book House,
166), p. 178.
  The second temple was financed largely by a pagan gov-
ernment. Is it proper for the church today to accept govern-
ment money for its institutions?

READY RESPONSE (Ezra 1:5, 6).
  Who in particular responded to Cyrus' decree? What was
the driving force behind their decision? Ezra 1:5.

  Ezra lifts the veil so that we may see the operation of the
unseen heavenly realm. It was God who "stirred" up Cyrus
(Ezra 1:1), and God who "raised" His people to respond.
   How did the Jews and their non-Jewish acquaintances in
their communities respond in a material way to this chal-
lenging venture? Ezra 1:6.

   The time of departure from Babylon was probably the spring
of 536 B.C. This gave the leaders and the people who would
join the great migration to Palestine approximately a year to
prepare for the trek. During these months, they received gifts
of gold, silver, and other necessities in addition to the horses,
mules, asses, and camels for transportation.
   What special treasures did Cyrus order his treasurer,
Mithredath, to entrust to Zerubbabel (Sheshbazzar)? Ezra
1:7-11. Under what circumstances had some of these same
treasures been used only two years earlier? Dan. 5:1-4, 23.

   The meaning of the Hebrew words that designate some of
these items is not clear, nor is it certain just how they arrived
at the total figures (see SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 329).
But how quickly a situation can change! As they praised their
idols, Belshazzar of Babylon and his lords, wives, and concu-
bines drank wine from sacred vessels once used in services
that pointed to the Lamb of God. Only two years later, Persia
was returning these vessels to the temple that the government
would help to build!
  The Holy Spirit is moving in the earth today, preparing
people of all nationalities for Christ's coming. Led by the
Spirit, approximately 1,500 persons are joining the Advent
people every day. Are you aware of the Spirit's presence,
and do you desire Him to prepare you for your spiritual
journey to Zion? What can you do this week to be more
involved in preparing others for the journey?

MIGRATING MULTITUDES (Ezra 2:1-67).
   Read Ezra 2:1, 64. Between these two verses is a record of
the first group of exiles from Babylon. Why did Ezra com-
pile such an extensive list?

  These people are the living "roots" of what was to be. Such
details seem dry to us, but at that point in Israel's history they
were essential. God had originally separated Israel from the
nations for a holy purpose: to be "an holy people unto the
Lord thy God" (Deut. 7:6). So Ezra needed to determine from
the records who were "the holy seed" (Ezra 9:2) who would
replant the nation.
   These basic groups are evident in the list:
   (1) The leadership (Ezra 2:2; Neh. 7:7), representing "the
       men of the people of Israel."
   (2) Descendants from a pre-captivity ancestor (Ezra 2:3-
       19).
   (3) Descendants from pre-captivity cities (2:20-35).
   (4) Priests descended from pre-captive families (2:36-39).
   (5) Levites descended from pre-captive families (2:40-42).
   (6) Nethinim and Solomon's servants (2:43-58). The ances-
       tors of these temple servants were apparently captives
       (such as the Gibeonites) or remnants of the Canaanites
       whom Moses, Joshua, David, and Solomon dedicated
       to the temple to perform menial tasks under the direc-
       tion of the priests and Levites. The word Nethinim means
       "the given ones."
  What happened to those groups who couldn't prove they
were of Israelite or priestly stock? Ezra 2:59-63.

   More than 600 persons could not identify themselves as
Israelites of the blood. It is possible they were attracted to
God's people like the mixed multitude who joined Israel in
the Exodus from Egypt (Ex. 12:38). Those claiming to be priests
were not permitted to serve until God gave permission.
  Read Revelation 21:26, 27. What similarities exist between
these verses and our lesson for today? (See also John 5:24;
Heb. 12:22, 23; Rev. 3:5.)



                                                                17

CHEERFUL GIVERS (Ezra 2:68-70).

  Ezra lists the returning Israelites by family, city, or office,
but he is silent on character and motive. What kinds of
people were likely to come on this journey and why?


   If a Jewish captive were 20 years of age in 605, 597, or 586
B.C. (the dates of the three major deportations), he or she
would be 88, 80, and 69, respectively, in 537 B.C., the year of
release. It is not likely that many of the elderly from the first
deportation would be physically able to make the return trip.
Some of the older persons from the third deportation might
have returned. Those persons who were strongly religious
(young or old) and/or nationalist in spirit would return. The
priests, Levites, and temple servants were naturally attracted,
since the new temple would allow them to work at their
ancestral careers. Finally, the poor—who had nothing to lose—
were also likely attracted.

   Before separating to their respective ancestral towns, this
diverse group assembled at the ruins of Solomon's temple
(Ezra 2:68, 70). In their joy upon a safe arrival, what did
they do? Ezra 2:68, 69.


   While this large sum of gold, silver, and priestly garments
was a freewill offering, it probably reflects some of the gifts
given by the Jews and their friends in Babylon and elsewhere.
Cyrus' grant to finance the construction of the temple created
a generous spirit in these patriots.
   Furthermore, while suffering the reproach of captivity, it
appears that the Israelites took Jeremiah's counsel to heart to
settle into the land of their sojourn (Jer. 29:4-7). Excavations at
Nippur, the area of Ezekiel's home during the exile, have
uncovered the archives of a large banking firm, "Murashu
Sons." Thousands of tablets contain more than one hundred
Jewish names, indicating that some Israelites became a wealthy,
influential minority in Persia. Their success is reflected in the
grand freewill offering they gave for the new temple in Jerusalem.

  Why would God prefer that we give little with a cheerful
heart than much with complaining? (Compare 2 Cor. 9:6, 7.)

FURTHER STUDY: This week we learned that the Holy Spirit
motivated the return to Jerusalem. Read more about the work
of the Holy Spirit in Isaiah 59:19; John 6:63; 14:18, 23, 26; 16:8,
14; Romans 8:26, 27.

551-560, and "Pray for the Latter Rain" in Testimonies to Minis-
ters, pp. 506-512.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How can you contribute to a spiritual revival among
     God's people?

   2. How "pure" should a Christian congregation keep its
      books? What are the functions of discipline and
      disfellowshiping?

SUMMARY: Multitudes headed home from Babylonian exile.
Seventh-day Adventist Christians are heading home too. Doors
long shut are opening in all the world, providing the gospel
with new avenues of access. This is the hour to fall to our
knees and plead for an outpouring of the Holy Spirit to em-
power us to fulfill our mission and prepare for the great
homecoming in the heavenly Jerusalem!

Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ezra 3, 4; Daniel 10.

     MEMORY TEXT: "And they sang together by course in
     praising and giving thanks unto the Lord; because he is
     good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel" (Ezra
     3:11).

   KEY QUESTIONS: Why is it true that many endeavors for
the Lord meet with obstacles? How should we confront chal-
lenges that threaten the progress of His cause?

   GOD IS WITH US ALWAYS. When Chip was a boy, it
seemed that sickness would be his way of life. He remembers
how fever, pneumonia, or other serious illness plagued his
childhood. In the long, restless nights he would awaken from
a half-sleep to see his mother in the soft glow of the night-
light, sitting in a rocking chair beside his bed, ready for any
emergency, always available.
   A mother's availability in time of need reflects one of the
great truths Israel learned from the altar of burnt offering. Its
morning and evening offerings were arranged to provide a
continuously burning sacrifice (Lev. 6:9-13). This sacrifice as-
sured the Israelites that God's grace is constantly available
any time, day or night. Thus, the first task of the returning
exiles was to restore the services of the altar of burnt offering.
As you study this week's lesson, remember that God is al-
ways available to you too.

FIRST THINGS FIRST (Ezra 3:1-6).

   When the first migration of Jews from Babylon reached
Judah, they scattered to their ancestral cities (Ezra 2:70). We
can only imagine the problems they faced in establishing their
claims to land and houses vacated by their ancestors 50 to 60
years earlier. The anger of the local people at this "invasion"
of Israelites may be reflected in the statement made a month
or two later when the people assembled at the site of the
temple ruins: "Fear was upon them because of the people of
those countries" (Ezra 3:3).

 When did the people reassemble at Jerusalem? Ezra 3:1, 6.
What was significant about this date? Lev. 23:24, 27, 34, 36.


    "The 7th month (Tishri) was one of the most sacred months
of the entire Jewish religious year. The 1st day of that month
was New Year's Day of the civil calendar [Rosh Hashanah].
. . . The month began with a blowing of trumpets and a holy
convocation (Lev. 23:24). . . . Ten days later came the solemn
Day of Atonement (Lev. 23:27), followed almost immediately
by the Feast of Tabernacles, from the 15th to the 22nd day of
the same month (Lev. 23:34-36)."—SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 3, pp. 338, 339.

   Even before the leaders made arrangements for rebuild-
ing the temple, what did they construct and put into opera-
tion? Ezra 3:2, 3. Why did they not wait until the temple was
completed before starting this aspect of the temple's ritual
service?


  There was always a sacrifice on the altar of burnt offering
(Lev. 6:9-13), symbolically providing forgiveness through a
Substitute to anyone who might seek the Lord. Even though it
might take years to build the temple, the essential element of
atonement by a Substitute and the assurance of God's forgive-
ness could be kept continuously before the people.

   Your Sabbath School class decides to conduct a Revela-
tion Seminar. Apply the principles of building an altar first.
(For example, dedication and devotion are the only reasons
to reach out; seek the assurance of the Holy Spirit's pres-
ence before you begin.)

BUILDING PREPARATIONS (Ezra 3:7-9).

  With whom did Joshua and Zerubbabel contract to work
on the temple? Ezra 3:7, first half.


  Joshua and Zerubbabel contracted with the skilled builders
among their own people, agreeing to pay them wages in money.
Most likely, the Babylonians had employed these craftsmen to
build their government and religious buildings.

   With whom did the leaders contract for cedar? Ezra 3:7,
last half.


   The cedar of the Lebanon mountains attains a height of 80
feet (24 meters) and a girth of 40 feet (12 meters) at its full
growth. Its fragrant wood was rot-resistant and knot-free,
making it ideal for building purposes. The Phoenicians cut the
trees in the mountains east of Sidon and transported the logs
down the slopes to the Mediterranean Sea. Here workmen
assembled the logs into rafts and floated them approximately
120 miles (192 kilometers) southward to Joppa (the modern
Jaffa-Tel Aviv), Judah's port city 35 to 40 miles (56 to 64
kilometers) west of Jerusalem (see 2 Chron. 2:16). From Joppa,
the Jews had an uphill task to move the logs inland to Jerusa-
lem, which is approximately 2,500 feet (750 meters) above sea
level at its highest point. It took seven months to collect the
building materials needed for the temple (Ezra 3:1, 6, 8).

   "The work was quickly begun, but it was not hurriedly and
slovenly dispatched. Each part was wrought by those who
were specially adapted for it. No amount of zeal in the cause
of God will make up for lack of intelligence and adaptation.
We must build up the spiritual house of the Lord—the Church
of Christ—not only inspired by consecration of spirit, but
guided by a wise and intelligent adoption of the best means
and appliances."—Homily on Ezra 3:7-13, Pulpit Commentary
(Chicago: Wilcox & Follett Co., n.d.), vol. 15, p. 40.

   Consider the extensive plans and organization involved
in the construction of the temple as a witness for Christ.
How do your local church facilities reflect such principles?

CORNERSTONE CELEBRATION (Ezra 3:10-13).
   For what great event did the leadership prepare a celebra-
tion? Ezra 3:10 (compare 1 Chron. 15:16).

   Since Joshua followed "the ordinance of David" in this
celebration, what psalm did the people probably sing? Ezra
3:11; 1 Chron. 16:7-36, especially note verse 34.

  Note how Psalms 106 and 107 open with the same call to
worship and praise. We are motivated to do so because of the
Lord's mercy and goodness in redeeming us from our en-
emies (107:2). From what enemy has He redeemed you, and
how has He done so?
  "Through sin men have sold themselves to the adversary,
but Heaven paid an infinite price to buy them back. . . . The
redeemed, of all people, have most reason to say that God is
good and that His mercy is everlasting. Far more than we do,
we should relate what Christ has done for us, and our love for
Him will deepen as we give expression to it."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 3, p. 873.
   At this climax of their fondest dreams, how did the people
respond? Ezra 3:11. How did the elderly react to this scene
of national rejoicing? Ezra 3:12, 13.

   If the older generation had formerly repented of their sins,
Solomon's temple would not have been destroyed, nor would
the exile have been necessary. Now, they had abundant evi-
dence that God miraculously had restored them to their home-
land and provided for the rebuilding process. It was nothing
less than disdain for God to wail their opinion of the new
temple so loudly that it drowned out the voices of praise.
   "The murmuring and complaining, and the unfavorable
comparisons made, had a depressing influence on the minds
of many, and weakened the hands of the builders."—Prophets
and Kings, p. 564.
   In what way does your attitude about certain situations
in your local church and the church at large impact upon
others? How is your life testifying to others that Jesus is

SAMARITAN CONFRONTATION (Ezra 4:1-5).

   When God works, Satan counters. After the workers laid
the cornerstone, Satan attempted to stall and make of no
effect God's purpose in restoring Israel and the temple.

  Who approached Zerubbabel, supposedly with the pur-
pose of helping to rebuild the temple? Ezra 4:1, 2. From
where had they originated? 2 Kings 17:24-41.


   The deportation of whole nations within the Near East was
Assyrian state policy. Three Assyrian rulers ordered the set-
tlement of nationalities in the territory of the northern king-
doms of Israel: Sargon (2 Kings 17:24-29, 33); Esarhaddon
(Ezra 4:2); and Ashurbanipal, "the great and noble Asnapper"
(Ezra 4:10). A Levitical priest was ordered to teach these
people about Jehovah (2 Kings 17:28). The result was a mixed
worship of truth and error. Thus the Samaritan nation was a
people of mixed nationality and mixed religion.

   Not just a friendly offer. The return of God's people had,
in effect, created a new province in an area abandoned for 50
years. Those who returned were thus subject to the control of
the nearest local government such as that of the Samaritans.
The offer to assist the Jews in rebuilding the temple possibly
hid a motive to secure political control of the area now gov-
erned by the newly restored Israel.

  After Zerubbabel declined their offer for help, how did
the Samaritans show their true colors? Ezra 4:4, 5.


   "Had the Jewish leaders accepted this offer of assistance,
they would have opened a door for the entrance of idolatry.
They discerned the insincerity of the Samaritans. They real-
ized that help gained through an alliance with these men
would be as nothing in comparison with the blessing they
might expect to receive by following the plain commands of
Jehovah."—Prophets and Kings, p. 568.

   As Christians, to what extent can we enter into close
commitments or alliances with those who do not share our
faith? What are the dangers? (See 2 Cor. 6:14-18.)

PREVAILING PRAYER (Daniel 10).
  In the third year of Cyrus (536/535 B.C.), how did Daniel
react to the news of the Samaritan opposition? Dan. 10:2, 3.

   "Daniel's period of mourning seems to have been contem-
porary with the serious threat that Cyrus' decree [to rebuild
the temple] might not be carried to completion after all, be-
cause of the false reports sent by the Samaritans to the court
of Persia, in an attempt to stop the building operations. The
significant fact that during these three weeks the angel was
struggling to influence Cyrus (vs. 12, 13) indicates that a vital
decision of the king was at stake. While praying for further
light . . . the prophet doubtless engaged in another period of
intensive intercession . . . that the work of the adversary
might be checked and that God's promises of restoration
might be fulfilled to His chosen people."—SDA Bible Commen-
tary, vol. 4, pp. 857, 858.
   What did Daniel learn while he was in vision? Dan.
10:13.

   The Hebrew word for "prince" can refer either to Cyrus or
to a supernatural evil personage attempting to control Cyrus,
even as Michael (likewise a Prince) also sought to persuade
him. The former urged the king to cancel his decree favoring
the Jews, while Michael appealed through his conscience to
confirm it. Two supernatural powers tried to influence Cyrus,
but the choice was his to make. For 21 days the fate of Judah
hung in the balance as Daniel—unaware of the supernatural
wrestling—prayed for Israel's deliverance from Samaritan
opposition.
  What insight does this experience give us regarding the
great controversy between Christ and Satan? Eph. 6:12.

   What place does intercessory prayer have in your spir-
itual experience? Why are affirmative answers to such prayers
often a long time in coming? What attitude should we adopt,
and what should we do while waiting for answers?

FURTHER STUDY: The apostle Paul's experience makes clear
that serious endeavors for the Lord often run into obstacles.
How did Paul describe some of these obstacles in 2 Corinthians
11:23-27? What motivated Paul to continue despite the hard-
ship? 1 Cor. 2:2.
   Read the portions of "The Return of the Exiles" and "The
Prophets of God Helping Them" in Prophets and Kings on
pages 560-572.

   God "permits us to encounter obstacles, persecution, and
hardships, not as a curse, but as the greatest blessing of our
lives. Every temptation resisted, every trial bravely borne,
gives us a new experience and advances us in the work of
character building. The soul that through divine power resists
temptation reveals to the world and to the heavenly universe
the efficiency of the grace of Christ."—Thoughts From the Mount
of Blessing, p. 117.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Your church is planning evangelistic meetings. But a
     faction suddenly brings the board to vote that no money
     can be spent on evangelism until a new organ is pur-
     chased for the church. As personal-ministries director,
     should you (a) enter into intercessory prayer; (b) ask the
     board to allow you to present your case, and ask board
     members to reconsider their decision; (c) visit key board
     members and ask them to reconsider prayerfully; (d)
     other?

     2. The altar of burnt offering teaches that God is always
        present. Can you think of instances when it would be
        helpful to remember this?

     3. How can you make your devotional life more meaning-
        ful? How do you pray about circumstances that concern
        the church, as well as yourself? Do you think that, be-
        cause God already knows everything, there is no need to
        pray?

SUMMARY: The first priority of the returned Jews was to build
the altar with its constantly burning sacrifice; then followed the
rebuilding of the temple. Just so, the Christian first establishes
and maintains a union with Christ through daily prayer and
Bible study. Then one can face life's varied challenges with
confidence, knowing that the Lord is present to help.

        A Second Attempt




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ezra 5, 6.

  MEMORY TEXT: "Believe in the Lord your God, so shall
  ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye pros-
  per" (2 Chronicles 20:20).

   KEY QUESTIONS: What is the force that resides in the
prophetic Word? Why does obedience to its direction result in
a revival of faith and action despite opposition?

   SECOND CHANCES. One day teenaged Shannon com-
peted in the long jump at a track meet; the next day the junior
high school student battled to stay alive. A victim of
meningococcemia, she was expected to die within hours after
she was admitted to the hospital, but Shannon refused to give
up. Although her left leg and right foot were amputated,
Shannon survived. Today she plans to be a teacher. Her in-
credible will to live helped her get a second chance at life.
   Like Shannon, the returned Jews faced an enormous, life-
threatening obstacle. The local Samaritans vigorously sought
to prevent their endeavors. During the next 15 years, Jewish
hopes dimmed. And a usurper to the Persian throne ordered
the builders to stop. Then prophetic voices began to sound.
Israel was given a second chance.
   As you study, ask yourself what prophetic voices say to us,
and particularly to you, in 1993.

HELPING HANDS (Ezra 5:1, 2).
   How did the Samaritans specifically prevent the Jews
from reconstructing the temple in the period between Cyrus
and Darius I, in the reign of Ahasuerus, and at one point
during the later reign of Artaxerxes I? Ezra 4:1-23.

   "It is generally held today that the incidents described in
ch. 4 are not given in their chronological order; specifically,
that the events of vs. 6-23 took place at a later time than those
of vs. 1-5, 24. Accordingly, v. 24 and the narrative in ch. 5
about the work of Haggai and Zechariah, who were active in
the 2d year of Darius I, are held to be a continuation of the
order of events that was interrupted at ch. 4:5."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 4, p. 347.
   The Persian kings were as follows:
   Ezra 4:1-5: Cyrus the Great (c. 553-530 B.C.), Cambyses
(530-522 B.C.), False Smerdis (522 B.C), Darius I (522-486 B.C.).
   Ezra 4:6: Xerxes (Ahasuerus; 486-465 B.C.).
   Ezra 4:7-23: Artaxerxes I (465-423 B.C.).
   Ezra 4:24 refers to verse 5, the second year of Darius I.
  Who challenged the dispirited and apathetic Jews to re-
sume work on the temple? Ezra 5:1. How had the Jews
reacted to the Samaritan threat? Haggai 1:2-4. Read the mes-
sage God gave to them in Haggai 1:5-13.

   "Spiritually as well as temporally, the Israelites were in a
pitiable state. So long had they murmured and doubted; so
long had they chosen to make personal interests first, while
viewing with apathy the Lord's temple in ruins, that many
had lost sight of God's purpose in restoring them to Judea. . . .
The lack of temporal prosperity was the result of a neglect to
put God's interests first."—Prophets and Kings, p. 573.
   Zerubbabel, Joshua, and the builders responded to God's
message with eager willingness. According to the figures in
Haggai 1:1 and 1:12-15, construction began anew 23 days after
the prophet's appeal. Read also Ezra 5:1, 2.
   How eagerly and quickly do you respond when the Lord
calls you to action? Can you testify to the special blessings
involved in following divine instruction? What personal
interests are hindering us from putting God first?

OFFICIAL MISGIVINGS (Ezra 5:3-17).

   On one side of the Behistun mountain that lies on the main
route between Iran and Iraq, Darius I ordered a sculptured
relief to be made of his conquest of the False Smerdis and nine
other contenders for the Persian throne. Cut into the rock
along with the figures (345 feet above ground level) is the
account of his victories written in three different languages.
With such a spirit of revolt in the air, it was only natural that
Persian officials would check out news of vigorous building
activities in Judah. And that is exactly what happened. Read
Ezra 5:3, 4.

   "On this side of the river" is better translated beyond the river.
The river referred to is the Euphrates, while Beyond the River
was the official name of that particular division of the Persian
Empire composed of Syria and Palestine. Tatnai was governor
of that region, and Shethar-boznai was most likely the royal
secretary.

   The King James Version suggests that the Persian delega-
tion wanted the building stopped until they could know
Darius' decision on the matter. But what kept the builders
steadfastly pursuing their task? Ezra 5:5.


   In the diplomatic manner of the elders, but especially in
their steadfast determination to erect the temple, we see the
striking influence of the prophetic witness of Haggai and
Zechariah. God's direct and pointed message lifted the Jews
above all fear of human authorities. They were toiling in
response to the very instruction of the Almighty, "the God of
heaven and earth" (verse 11), carrying out His specific direc-
tions. They refused to be intimidated.

   Summarize the letter Tatnai sent to Darius I. Ezra 5:6-17.
Notice especially what impressed him about the building
project (verse 8). Also notice how the Jewish elders ex-
plained the reason for the destruction of the temple (verses
11, 12).


  Is it good news or bad news that the "eye of God is upon
me"? Why?


                                                                   29
Tuesday                                       October 19
DARIUS' DECREE (Ezra 6:1-12).
  What evidence does Ezra 6:1, 2 give that Darius I was
willing to be fair with his Jewish subjects in Palestine?


  The king could have ordered the Jews to stop their work
when he could not find a record of Cyrus' decree in Babylon.
Instead, he continued searching until he found the decree.

   Contrast the decree that Darius found (Ezra 6:3-5) with
the decree Cyrus published throughout the empire (Ezra
1:2-4). Why was it providential that Darius discovered the
official decree?


   The decree that Darius found was for official use only. It
served as a directive to realm officials and stated that the
royal treasury would pay to rebuild the temple. The decree
that Cyrus published contained a permit to return to Judah, to
rebuild the temple, and to collect money to assist with the
rebuilding project. It stated nothing about the treasury paying
for expenses.
   Cyrus was the revered founder of the Persian Empire. Thus
his decrees carried considerable weight with later Persian
rulers. His statements regarding the size of the temple, its
manner of building, and the plans for financing it would
influence Darius I to reaffirm Cyrus' decree.

   The Samaritans suppressed. In his response (Ezra 6:6-12),
Darius placed accountability for building the temple on the
"desk" of Tatnai. He authorized Tatnai to finance the building
from Tatnai's tax funds. Darius also empowered Tatnai to
sentence with capital punishment and confiscation of prop-
erty any who dared interfere with the temple project. This
action effectively stopped Samaritan hindrance to the temple's
erection.

   Darius expressed a measure of faith in the Jews' God by
requesting that they pray for his life and the lives of his
sons (Ezra 6:10). Why do you feel it was right for the Jews to
do so? See 1 Timothy 2:1-4. What reasons do we have to pray
for government officials?

Wednesday                                     October 20
THE TEMPLE IS FINISHED (Ezra 6:13-15).

  How do these verses characterize the Jews' second at-
tempt to rebuild the temple? Ezra 5:8; 6:12, 13.


   The account of the Jews' second attempt to erect the temple
is characterized by a Hebrew word that appears several times.
The word highlights the scene with intense activity ("with
diligence," NIV).
   "When God opens the way for the accomplishment of a
certain work, and gives assurance of success, the chosen in-
strumentality must do all in his power to bring about the
promised result. In proportion to the enthusiasm and perse-
verance with which the work is carried forward, will be the
success given."—Prophets and Kings, p. 263.

  What specific promises given by God through Zechariah
did the builders see fulfilled? Zech. 1:16; 4:6-10.


  The Jews began their second attempt at building the temple
on September 21, 520 B.C. (Haggai 1:14, 15) and completed
the task on March 12, 515 B.C. (Ezra 6:15), a period of ap-
proximately 4 1/2 years. The previous temple had taken seven
years to build (see 1 Kings 6:37, 38).

   Thank-you notes. In Ezra 6:14, Ezra acknowledges that
apart from God's providence nothing would have been ac-
complished. He also recognizes the agents through whom
God worked: Cyrus, Darius I, and Artaxerxes I.
   The mention of Artaxerxes indicates that Ezra probably
wrote this account during the time of Artaxerxes (465-423
B.C.). Why would Ezra list Artaxerxes I when he came to the
throne 50 years after the temple was completed? Since Artaxerxes
was the third king "to beautify the house of the Lord" (Ezra
7:27) and to forward the work of restoring Jerusalem, it was
fitting for Ezra to mention him.

   People often begin projects for God with enthusiasm but
become discouraged when obstacles arise. How does the
story of Ezra and Nehemiah help with this problem? (1) It
shows the effects of hard work and prayer. (2) It tells exactly
how things should be done today. (3) It demonstrates how
God accomplishes the impossible. (4) Other.

                                                              31
Thursday                                       October 21
DEDICATION AND PASSOVER (Ezra 6:16-22).
   In what spirit did the former exiles celebrate the dedica-
tion of the finished temple? What is the significance of the
expressions, "the children of Israel," and "a sin offering for
all Israel"? Ezra 6:16, 17.

   Twenty-one years had elapsed since the returned exiles
first began work on the temple. Now they realized with great
joy that God had never abandoned them or His cause.
   Ezra's emphasis on "Israel" testifies that the restored na-
tion—with representatives from all 12 tribes—was the true
spiritual descendant of the two Jewish kingdoms that had
gone into Assyrian-Babylonian captivity.
  Compare the sacrifices of this second dedication service
with those offered at the consecration of Solomon's temple.
Ezra 6:17; 1 Kings 8:63.

   While the total number of offerings for the dedication of
Zerubbabel's temple was considerably smaller, we still won-
der how it was done and why. It should be noted that the bulk
of the sacrifices at Solomon's dedication were "peace offer-
ings" (see 1 Kings 8:63). Only the fat of these animals was
burned; their flesh provided food for the festive meal—or
meals—for the masses who attended the celebration. Thus the
number attending may well have determined the number of
peace offerings sacrificed.
   Sharing the good news. A few weeks later the Israelites
celebrated the Passover (Ezra 6:19). There is evidence that
they were "evangelizing" in the fact that those who "had
separated themselves . . . from the filthiness of the heathen of
the land" ate the Passover with them (Ezra 6:21).
   Do you see your faith as being strong enough to keep you
through the 21 years it took Israel to rebuild the temple? If
not, how can your faith be strengthened?
   "When our prayers seem not to be answered, we are to
cling to the promise; for the time of answering will surely
come, and we shall receive the blessing we need most."
—Steps to Christ, p. 96.
   What promises are you clinging to today?

FURTHER STUDY: Read Isaiah 1:1, 11-20 and Zechariah 7:1,
9, 10. What underlying principle is basic to prophetic mes-
sages, and how can you apply it to your life?
   Read portions of "The Prophets of God Helping Them,"
"Joshua and the Angel," and "Not by Might nor by Power" in
Prophets and Kings, pp. 573-597, and "Decision and Prompt-
ness" in Gospel Workers, pp. 133-135.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:

  1. What can we learn about intercessory prayer from Ezra's
     experience?

  2. In Thursday's lesson we learned that the Israelites' love
     for God attracted others to the faith. What does your
     attitude and behavior tell others about the God you
     profess to serve?

SUMMARY: Samaritans harassed the Jews into idleness. But
the prophetic witness of Haggai and Zechariah led to a strik-
ing revival of faith, enabling the Jews to succeed. Responding
to the appeals of God through Scripture and the prophetic gift
of Ellen White will bring a revival to God's end-time people,
enabling them to keep pace with His opening providences in
preparing a people for Christ's return.

    got angry about that because it was Everybody's job.
     nycdy would have done it, but Nobody realized that
             y wouldn't do it. It ended up that Everybody
  blamed Somebody when actually Nobody asked Anybody.

Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ezra 7, 8.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Ezra had prepared his heart to seek
     the law of the Lord, and to do it, and to teach in Israel
     statutes and judgments" (Ezra 7:10).

   KEY QUESTIONS: Why is understanding Scripture so es-
sential to a vibrant Christian experience? What efforts are you
willing to make to obtain such an understanding?

   REGAINING OUR HEALTH. More than 1,100 strangers
responded to a New Year's Eve call and braved a winter
storm to help save the life of Joanne, a 19-year-old victim of
leukemia. The young woman required a donation of bone
marrow compatible with hers. Nearly 40 relatives had tested
negative, and now the family appealed to the public for help.
   As bone marrow is essential for physical life, so is the
Word of God essential for spiritual life (John 6:63). Joanne's
chances of finding compatible marrow were only one in 20,000
in the general populace and one in 10,000 in her community of
black persons. But for millions of people, the life-giving Scrip-
tures are at their fingertips, and many ongoing programs
make them available to previously unreached language groups.
Vigorous spiritual health comes only as the Word of God is
implanted in our hearts (James 1:21). This week we study how
God's Word was implanted in Ezra's heart and in the hearts
of his people.

BACK TO THE BIBLE (Ezra 7:1-6, 10).
  Nearly 60 years elapsed between the completion of the
temple under Zerubbabel and Joshua and the arrival of Ezra
with a second migration of Jews from Babylon.
  Although Ezra was a priest by descent and training, what
was his special interest? Ezra 7:6.

   The Hebrew word torah is translated "law." In Ezra and
Nehemiah, the word torah appears 24 times. Torah refers to
God's revealed will or any part of it. The term denotes God's
"instructions" as given to His people in Scripture. Torah often
designates the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible
written by Moses. It also applies to all of Old Testament
Scripture as Ezra assembled it.
    Ezra's two desires: (1) He wanted to know, understand,
and obey God's will (Ezra 7:10). (2) He also desired to know
why Israel had gone into captivity (Ezra 9:7). With daily,
patient study of the Scriptures, especially the Pentateuch,
Ezra became "skilled in the law of Moses" (Ezra 7:6, RSV).
As he "searched the historical and poetical books of the Bible
. . . [he learned] why the Lord had permitted Jerusalem to be
destroyed, and His people carried captive into a heathen
land."—Prophets and Kings, p. 608.
   To what important facts about themselves would Ezra's
study and teaching have called the people's attention? Ezra
7:6, 10; Deut. 4:6-8 (compare Rom. 3:1, 2).

   "It is the first and highest duty of every rational being to
learn from the Scriptures what is truth, and then to walk in
the light, and encourage others to follow his example. We
should day by day study the Bible diligently, weighing every
thought, and comparing scripture with scripture. With divine
help, we are to form our opinions for ourselves, as we are to
answer for ourselves before God."—The Great Controversy, p.
598.
  According to the quotation above and Ezra 7:10, what
three-pronged approach should you take as you study the
Bible if you would truly know God's will for your life?

AUTHORITY FROM ARTAXERXES I (Ezra 7:11-26).

   The Persian kings evidently had commissioners, drawn
from the ranks of the subject nations, who functioned as ad-
visers on the affairs of their respective peoples (see Neh.
11:24). Studies have shown that Ezra's title, "a scribe of the
law of the God of heaven" (Ezra 7:12), indicates he was a
commissioner in charge of Jewish affairs. Such an appoint-
ment gave him a great deal of influence in the court and
brought him in contact with Artaxerxes the king. (See SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 366.)

   What wide-sweeping permission did Artaxerxes I give
the Jews at this time? Ezra 7:13, 14.


   The Lord made it evident that He wanted His people to
resettle in their homeland. Just as His servant Daniel influ-
enced Cyrus, now Ezra appealed to Artaxerxes.

   Who else beside the king wanted Ezra to organize the
province of Judah? Ezra 7:14. How did Artaxerxes ask Ezra
to organize the province? Ezra 7:25, 26.


   The fact that the king's seven counselors endorsed Judah as
a functioning national entity in the Persian Empire suggests
certain political motives. A few years earlier Egypt revolted
from Persian domination. In 456 B.C. (the year after Ezra's
return) Megabyzos, Artaxerxes' brother-in-law, entered Egypt
at the head of a Persian army and in a successful two-year
campaign restored Persian authority. The establishment of
Judah in 457 B.C. as a viable, subject nation would give Per-
sian forces a loyal Palestinian base from which to launch their
military excursions into Egypt.
   "In the word of God the curtain is drawn aside, and we
behold, behind, above, and through all the play and counterplay
of human interests and power and passions, the agencies of
the all-merciful One, silently, patiently working out the coun-
sels of His own will."—Education, p. 173.

  What in this lesson encourages you to believe that God is
always active to accomplish His purpose in your life and in
your church?

A TIME FOR THANKSGIVING (Ezra 7:27, 28).

  Ezra 7:6, 28 suggests that Ezra appeared in person before
the king to request the provisions embodied in the written
decree. What enabled this humble man to exercise such
holy boldness? Compare Romans 10:17.


   Ezra studied the Scriptures diligently in order to know
God's will. Thus he developed both a steadfast faith in God
and courage to use his position to benefit God's people. Holy
boldness springs from intimate communion with the heavenly
King of kings.
   "The weak man may become strong, the timid may become
brave, and the irresolute and undecided may become men of
quick and firm decision, when they feel that God considers
them of sufficient consequence to accept their labors."—Tes-
timonies, vol. 4, p. 614.

   Summarize Ezra's reaction to the generosity of the Per-
sian court. Notice to whom Ezra gives the credit. Ezra 7:27,
28 (compare Proverbs 21:1).


   There is no self-glorifying on Ezra's part. He freely ac-
knowledges that it was God who prompted the Persians, and
that it was God's grace that enabled him to make a persuasive
presentation.

  How sensitive are you to the evidences of God's overrul-
ing providences in your personal affairs? in the church? in
the world? Is the attitude of praise and thanksgiving a nor-
mal part of your life? Why or why not?

   "Difficulties will arise that will try your faith and patience.
Face them bravely. Look on the bright side. If the work is
hindered, be sure that it is not your fault, and then go for-
ward, rejoicing in the Lord. Heaven is full of joy. It resounds
with the praises of Him who made so wonderful a sacrifice
for the redemption of the human race. Should not the church
on earth be full of praise? Should not Christians publish through-
out the world the joy of serving Christ? Those who in heaven
join with the angelic choir in their anthem of praise must learn
on earth the song of heaven, the keynote of which is thanks-
giving."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 244.

                                                               37

EXODUS UNDER EZRA (Ezra 8:1-30).

  Nearly 150 years had elapsed since the first captives had
been taken to Babylon. And it was now 80 years since Zerubbabel
had led the initial migration back home.
   Ezra addressed his appeal to return to Judah to the "chief"
men, the heads of family groups. If they agreed to leave
Babylon, they would have an important influence in urging
"clan" members to return also.

   At the staging area, Ezra discovered that no one from the
tribe of Levi had decided to return. How did he remedy the
situation? Ezra 8:15-20.


   Levitical families would be reluctant to leave their estab-
lished homes and gainful employment in Babylon, because
unlike those of other tribes, they had no hereditary lands
awaiting them in Palestine. The Levites were dependent on
Israel's tithe (Num. 18:20, 21). Thus, the return to Palestine
meant they would have to exchange their economic security
for the seeming uncertainties of a tithing system that varied
with the spiritual and material condition of Judah. But the
Levites were the centerpiece in Ezra's plan to instruct the
people in the statutes and judgments of the law of God.

   God's protection, not man's. Next, Ezra led the people in a
season of fasting and prayer, asking that God would honor
their trust in Him and bring them safely through the perils of
the journey (Ezra 8:21-23). Ezra had spoken so openly of the
true God before the king that he was embarrassed to ask for
military protection along the way.

   Describe Ezra's plan for the transportation of the gold,
silver, and costly vessels. Why was this a good plan? Ezra
8:24-29.


  Although Ezra led the people in several days of fasting
and prayer, it is evident that he also made careful plans to
assure success. If we commit our lives to Christ, why is it
necessary to make plans? Why is it not a lack of faith to
exercise prudent thought and set goals for life's journey?
How can you balance your human plans with total trust in
God's control and guidance of your affairs?

HOME AT LAST (Ezra 7:7-9; 8:31-36).
  In what year of the reign of Artaxerxes I did Ezra's group
arrive in Jerusalem? Ezra 7:7.

   Because Ezra and Nehemiah appeared as one book in He-
brew manuscripts until A.D. 1448, we may presume that a
similar dating system undergirds both. Evidence from Nehemiah
1:1; 2:1, and archeological findings from a fifth-century-B.C.
Jewish garrison in southern Egypt indicate that the Jews at the
time of Ezra were using an autumn-to-autumn calendar. Thus,
Ezra's migration began and ended in 457 B.C., the seventh
year of Artaxerxes' reign according to Jewish reckoning. Since
it would have taken some time to put into operation the king's
directives, the decree that fully restored Judah as a nation
would not have become effective before the autumn of 457
B.C.
   Why was 457 B.C. a crucial year for God's people? Dan.
9:25.

   According to Daniel 9:25 the Messiah would appear 69
prophetic weeks after "the going forth of the commandment
to restore and to build Jerusalem." A day in prophetic time is
equivalent to a literal year (Num. 14:34; Eze. 4:6). Therefore,
69 weeks x 7 days per week = 483 days/years. The books of
Ezra and Nehemiah list four "decrees": (1) 537 B.C., to rebuild
the temple (Ezra 1:1-4); (2) 519 B.C., to reactivate the first
decree to rebuild the temple (Ezra 6:1-12); (3) 457 B.C., to
restore the autonomy of the Jewish nation under Persian lord-
ship (Ezra 7:11-26; this is one of the most significant dates in
human history); (4) 444 B.C., to restore recently burned gates
and partially destroyed walls of Jerusalem (Neh. 2:3-5; 6:15).
   Since the third decree is the only one that truly restored
Judah as a functioning state, it is reasonable to begin Daniel's
prophecy with the time when that decree became effective—
the autumn of 457 B.C. (Compare Ezra 6:14.) On this basis of
reckoning the Messiah would appear in the fall of A.D. 27, the
year in which Jesus was baptized. (See Luke 3:1, 2, 21.)
  Why do you think God told is Old Testament church
when the Messiah would come? Why is He not as specific
regarding the Second Coming?

FURTHER STUDY: Read Daniel 8:13, 14; 9:21-26.
   The year 457 B.C. is critical to us, as well, because it is the
starting point of the 2300-day prophecy of Daniel 8:14. In
Daniel 9:24, the angel "tells Daniel that 490 years [remember
the year-day principle] were to be cut off from the longer
period of 2300 years. As the starting point for the 490 years,
Gabriel points to 'the going forth of the command to restore
and build Jerusalem' (Dan. 9:25), which took place in 457
B.C. . . .
   "The 490 years ended in A.D. 34 [when Stephen was stoned].
When we cut off 490 years from the 2300 years, we are left
with 1810 years. Since the 2300 years were to extend 1810
years beyond A.D. 34, they reach to the year 1844.
   "In 1844, Christ came to the Ancient of Days and began the
final phase of His high-priestly ministry in the heavenly sanc-
tuary. This ministry was the antitype of the Day of Atonement
cleansing of the sanctuary that Daniel 7 depicts as the pre-
Advent investigative judgment."—Seventh-day Adventists Be-
lieve, p. 324.

  Read "Ezra, the Priest and Scribe" in Prophets and Kings, pp.
607-617; SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, pp. 100-109, 326, 327;
vol. 2, pp. 110, 116; Seventh-day Adventists Believe, pp. 312-327.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Does the thought of an investigative judgment cause you
     to be fearful or joyful? Why? Might some fear be essen-
     tial to growth in sanctification?

     2. What assurance do we find in the process of the investi-
        gative judgment? 1 John 2:1.

     3. Upon what does the investigative judgment encourag(
        us to depend? Matt. 22:11-14; 2 Cor. 12:9; Rev. 3:5.

     4. List two reasons for the investigative judgment.

SUMMARY: The driving force of Ezra's migration was a
back-to-the-Bible movement. A similar earnest searching of
the Scriptures will result in spiritual strength for believers
today, inspiring them to daring exploits of witnessing.

          Mixed Marriages




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ezra 9, 10.
  MEMORY TEXT: "Be ye not unequally yoked together
  with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness
  with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light
  with darkness?" (2 Corinthians 6:14).
  KEY QUESTION: Why are religiously mixed marriages
quite often a detriment to spiritual development?
   "WHAT ARE YOUR CHANCES?" The series' title was an
attention-getter for college students: "Love, Courtship, and
Marriage"! All eyes were fixed on the speaker and the young
couple. "Marilyn," the speaker said, "I want you to stand up
here with me and face the audience. You represent a Chris-
tian. Ned, you stand one step lower facing Marilyn and take
her hand. You represent a non-Christian suitor.
   "You want to marry, but you do not have the same spir-
itual values. Marilyn, what are your chances of bringing Ned
to where you stand?" Marilyn seized Ned's hand with both of
hers and pulled, but the husky Ned didn't budge. "Ned, try to
bring Marilyn to you." With one quick yank, Marilyn tumbled
down. Few missed the point: In a mixed marriage, it is easier
for the believer to compromise faith than to lift the unbeliev-
ing spouse to a higher spiritual level. Mixed marriages were
one of the great issues that faced Ezra.

Sunday                                          October 31
PROBLEM AND PRAYER (Ezra 9:1-15).

   Like yeast in bread dough, Ezra's spiritual influence began
to penetrate the earlier settlers. Once in their homeland, Ezra
was able to arouse some consciences in less than five months.

   What problem was thus presented to Ezra? Why was it so
serious an issue? Ezra 9:1, 2 (compare Deut. 7:6).

   No one is authorized to mount the judgment seat to criti-
cize persons in religiously mixed marriages. Not all mixed
marriages have harmed godly believers. Nevertheless, it is
often true that a religiously mixed marriage leads the believer
to compromise his or her faith. The possibility was that Jewish
intermarriage with pagans would lead to the extinction of the
true religion. Since even the priests and Levites were involved
in this trend, the practice would eventually become wide-
spread.
   Last week we learned that Ezra was an earnest student of
Scripture. Surely he must have known about the counsel God
gave to Israel after He led them out of Egypt. He also must
have known that the problem of believers marrying unbe-
lievers was one reason for the Flood. (See Gen. 6:1, 2, 4, 5; Ex.
34:14-16; Deut. 7:1-4; Joshua 23:11-13.)

  How did Ezra react after becoming aware of the problem?
Ezra 9:3-15.


   "In his study of the causes leading to the Babylonian cap-
tivity, Ezra had learned that Israel's apostasy was largely
traceable to their mingling with heathen nations. He had seen
that if they had obeyed God's command to keep separate
from the nations surrounding them, they would have been
spared many sad and humiliating experiences. Now when he
learned that notwithstanding the lessons of the past, men of
prominence had dared transgress the laws given as a safe-
guard against apostasy, his heart was stirred within him."
—Prophets and Kings, p. 620.

   Why does the counsel against believers marrying unbe-
lievers still apply to Christians today? How should we com-
municate concern to those about to enter a mixed marriage?
How should we relate to the couple after the marriage has
been entered into? Why?

SEVERING MIXED TIES (Ezra 10).

   As the priests and Levites, along with the men, women,
and children, witnessed Ezra's anguish over their mixed mar-
riages, they themselves burst into tears. In his prayer, Ezra
proposed no solution; he feared there was none.

  What solution did Shechaniah propose? Ezra 10:2-4.


   The remedy to divorce their foreign wives and put them
and their children away came from one of the leading men
and was sworn to, and thus endorsed, by both the leadership
and the people (Ezra 10:5). This tragic solution, resulting as it
did in great trauma for the families involved, was evidently
felt to be the lesser of two evils. We may assume that the plan
involved the return of the wives and children to their parental
homes beyond the borders of Judah.

   An urgent proclamation. Ezra 10:7 tells us that a proclama-
tion then went throughout the entire land, calling for "all the
children of the captivity" to meet in Jerusalem. Any who
would not come would be separated from the congregation
and his property appropriated to the sacred use of the temple
(Ezra 10:8).

   Summarize the appeal Ezra made to the people, and their
response. Ezra 10:10-14.


   Although Ezra had not proposed the solution, he evidently
endorsed it. He plainly laid before the national assembly the
nature of their trespass and called on them to respond in
harmony with the solution covenanted a few days earlier by
the leaders and congregation at Jerusalem.
   The ninth month in the Jewish calendar is the time of heavy
winter rains. The weather, plus the extent of the problem,
contributed to the decision that those involved should appear
before suitable panels of elders and judges in each city to have
their cases reviewed and settled.

   Although God freely forgives, why is it so difficult to
retrace our steps once we've sinned? Remember, it is better
to heed the fence at the top of the cliff than to have an
ambulance waiting for us at the foot.

                                                               43

DANGERS OF A PERSISTENT BAD PRACTICE (Neh. 13:23-
29).

   Thirteen years after the first recorded instance of mixed
marriages, Nehemiah, as governor, faced it again. Nehemiah
served two terms as governor of Judah. After the initial stint
of 12 years (Neh. 5:14), he returned to the court of Artaxerxes
(13:6), probably for several years. When he returned to Judah,
he was once again confronted with the problem of mixed
marriages (13:23, 24). Now he perceived a new danger, "namely
the corruption of the next generation. The babble of languages
among the children (13:24) was not only a symptom but a
threat: it meant a steady erosion of Israelite identity at the
level of all thinking and expression, and a loss of access to the
Word of God."—Kidner, Ezra & Nehemiah, p. 131.

  What did the people vow during a service in which they
renewed their covenant loyalty to God? Neh. 10:29, 30.


   The renewal of Israel's commitment to God and the subse-
quent years under Nehemiah's governorship (Neh. 5:14) were
high points in the nation's post-exilic experience.
   "Every true turning to the Lord brings abiding joy into the
life. . . . It is God's glory to encircle sinful, repentant human
beings in the arms of His love, to bind up their wounds, to
cleanse them from sin, and to clothe them with the garments
of salvation."—Prophets and Kings, p. 668.

  In his appeal to the people, Nehemiah referred to Solomon
(Neh. 13:26). How did this king, despite his wisdom, even-
tually apostatize? 1 Kings 3:1; 11:1-8.


   "Solomon flattered himself that his wisdom and the power
of his example would lead his wives from idolatry to the
worship of the true God, and also that the alliances thus
formed would draw the nations round about into close touch
with Israel."—Prophets and Kings, p. 54.

   Why does the influence of evil seem to exert itself in a
stronger, more effective manner than does the influence of
good?

INTERMARRIAGE AND INTRIGUE (Neh. 6:17, 18; 13:4-9, 28).

   How did Tobiah the Ammonite and Sanballat the Horonite
secure influence over the affairs of Judah? Neh. 13:4, 5 (com-
pare 6:17, 18; 13:28).


   It is generally recognized that Eliashib, the high priest, was
"allied" or "connected" to Tobiah, probably through the mar-
riages of Tobiah and his son with two prominent families in
Judah (Neh. 6:17-19). The high priest was also linked with
Sanballat through the marriage of his grandson with Sanballat's
daughter (Neh. 13:4, 28). Marriage with the enemy influenced
Eliashib the high priest and other leading families to betray
their nation. The high priest even allowed Tobiah to live in the
temple complex while Nehemiah was back at the Persian
court (Neh. 13:4-7).

   What vigorous action did Nehemiah take against these
mixed marriages, especially those at the priestly level? Neh.
13:8, 9, 28-30.


   "A grandson of the high priest, having married a daughter
of the notorious Sanballat, was not only removed from office,
but promptly banished from Israel. . . .
   "Many who had married idolaters chose to go with them
into exile; and these, with those who had been expelled from
the congregation, joined the Samaritans. Hither some who
had occupied high positions in the work of God found their
way, and after a time cast in their lot fully with them. Desiring
to strengthen this alliance, the Samaritans promised to adopt
more fully the Jewish faith and customs; and the apostates,
determined to outdo their former brethren, erected a temple
on Mount Gerizim, in opposition to the house of God at
Jerusalem. Their religion continued to be a mixture of Juda-
ism and heathenism; and their claim to be the people of God
was the source of schism, emulation, and enmity between the
two nations, from generation to generation."—Prophets and
Kings, pp. 674, 675.

   How could Israel separate herself from strangers, yet still
attract others to God? What implications does your answer
have for the Seventh-day Adventist Church today?


                                                               45

DIVORCE FOR THE WRONG REASONS (Mal. 2:11, 14-16).
   God also directed Malachi to speak to the issue of mixed
marriages. How did divorce figure into the matter? How did
the Lord regard such divorces? Mal. 2:11, 14-16.

   The "daughter of a strange [or foreign] god" (Mal. 2:11)
was an idolatress who served a foreign deity just as the Israel-
ites were sons of Yahweh because they served the true God
(Deut. 14:1, RSV). Malachi speaks about God's hatred of di-
vorce in the context of both leaders and people divorcing their
Jewish spouses so they could marry pagan women.
   What New Testament principle continues to advise Chris-
tians against mixed marital unions? 2 Cor. 6:14-16.

   What counsels regarding marriage did the apostles Paul
and Peter give to persons who became Christians? 1 Cor.
7:12-16; 1 Peter 3:1.

   Why did Ezra and Nehemiah insist on dissolving the mixed
marriages in Judah, while Paul and Peter encouraged new
Christians to keep their nonbelieving spouses? In the time of
Ezra and Nehemiah, national existence was at stake—not so
in Christian times. Paul and Peter gave their counsel when the
church was young and growing rapidly. Thus it often oc-
curred that a husband or wife would become a Christian, but
his or her spouse would choose to continue with the belief
they both held at the time of their marriage. The apostles
advised that in such cases it would not be right for the Chris-
tian spouse to divorce the nonbelieving spouse. This counsel
indicates God's will today for those who find themselves in a
spiritually divided home. God will guide a believer in adopt-
ing winning ways toward the nonbelieving spouse. While no
one is required to submit to abusive behavior from a spouse, a
believer is encouraged to stay with the nonbelieving spouse
because there is always the possibility that the believer's wit-
ness will attract the nonbeliever to Christ.
  Neither Beth nor Jim was a Christian when they married.
Recently Beth became a Seventh-day Adventist, and she
wonders how she should regard Jim. How would you advise
her?

FURTHER STUDY: How does Genesis 24:1-4 assist in your
understanding of this week's lesson? Why was it so important
for Isaac to have a spouse of like religious faith?
   Read also "A Spiritual Revival" in Prophets and Kings, pp.
618-627; "Unscriptural Marriages" in Testimonies, vol. 4, pp.
503-508; "Marriage With Unbelievers" in Testimonies, vol. 5,
pp. 361-368.

   "Since marriage itself is by divine plan, it follows that one's
attitude toward marriage may be colored by his attitude to-
ward God. Where neither party of a marriage reveres God,
neither may honor highly his marriage vow.
   "If one party is a Christian and the other is not, there may
be serious trouble. The non-Christian may be jealous that his
mate has given God first place. He may desire to do things or
to go to places that the Christian cannot conscionably go. Such
things as religious offerings, church attendance, family wor-
ship, may cause deep friction in a divided home."—Raymond
H. Woolsey, Planning the Ideal Home (Hagerstown, Md.: Re-
view and Herald Publishing Association, 1975), p. 30.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Malachi 2:11, 14-16 speaks about divorce on two levels: a
     believer's "divorce" from God (apostasy) and divorce in
     human marriage. When is equating apostasy with di-
     vorce an appropriate comparison? (Compare 1 Cor. 7:10,
     11.)

   2. In biblical times there were only two classes: Israelites
      and non-Israelites. But today, apart from the large num-
      ber of non-Christians, there is a great variety of Chris-
      tian denominations. Is it wise for a Christian from one
      denomination to marry someone from another denomi-
      nation? Why?

   3. After studying this week's lesson, how would you an-
      swer the Key Question on page 41?

SUMMARY: The strength of society and the church lies in the
strength of homes. Mixed marriages have never been God's
ideal. The practice threatened the existence of Judah in the
time of Ezra and Nehemiah. We are always counseled against
forming such marriages. But we should do everything pos-
sible to hold an established home together and to bring the
nonbelieving spouse into the true Christian faith.

           A Patriot's Vision




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Neh. 1:1-2:18.
     MEMORY TEXT: "Neither told I any man what my God
     had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem" (Nehemiah 2:12).
  KEY QUESTIONS: Why is it essential for a leader to be a
person of vision? How does a leader in God's cause learn to
understand God's will for leaders and those who follow?
   VISION DRIVEN. Will Steger, age 45, had a dream. He
and Jean-Louis Etienne formed a team that would tramp across
Antarctica. Initially pinned down by a 60-day storm with 100
mph (160 kph) winds and -45° (F) temperatures, their five-
member group gradually ticked off the sections of the 4,000-
mile (6,400 kilometer) trek. On February 20, 1990, the men
with their three sleds and 40 dogs began the last leg of their
great crossing. Their desire to call people's attention to the
environmental fragility of the Antarctic and the need for glo-
bal cooperation to protect it had lifted them above the intense
hardship they had endured for 6 1/2 months.
   Like Steger, all good leaders are visionaries. They see a
need, form a purpose, and inspire others to help fulfill the
vision. Nehemiah was a Hebrew patriot with a vision. He
envisioned delivering God's people from their enemies and
bringing about spiritual renewal. As you study this week, ask
yourself, What vision for the church has God put in my heart?

BROKEN WALLS—BURNED GATES (Neh. 1:1-3).
  The book of Nehemiah opens with Nehemiah living in
Shushan, the winter capital of the Persian Empire (Neh. 1:1).
Shushan lay 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the Persian
Gulf and is the setting for the prophecy of Daniel 8:2 (compare
Esther 1:2). As the king's cupbearer, Nehemiah was in close
contact with King Artaxerxes (Neh. 1:11, last part).
  What news about conditions in Jerusalem and the nation
did Hanani bring to Nehemiah? Neh. 1:2, 3.

  The Hebrew words for "father," "son," and "brother" des-
ignate distant relatives, as well as immediate kinship. Hanani
may have been a more distant relative, but it is possible that
he was Nehemiah's blood brother (compare Neh. 7:2).
  Summarize the evidence that Hanani's report referred,
not to the devastation rendered by Nebuchadnezzar in 586
B.C., but to recent destruction. Ezra 4:7, 11-23.

   The Jews completed the temple under Zerubbabel in 515
B.C., the sixth year of Darius I (Ezra 6:15). Nearly 60 years
elapsed before Ezra arrived in the late summer of 457 B.C.
with a decree from Artaxerxes I directing him to organize the
nation along the lines of the Mosaic code (Ezra 7:14, 24-26).
Twelve years later, probably in December 445 B.C., Nehemiah
received news about conditions in the city. During at least a
portion of those 12 years Ezra and his associates started to
rebuild the walls and gates of Jerusalem (Ezra 4:7, 12, 13, 16).
   Hanani's report to Nehemiah most likely refers to Ezra 4:7-
23, "in which a bid to rebuild the walls had been reported to
King Artaxerxes and promptly crushed 'by force and power.'
It was an ominous development, for the ring of hostile
neighbours round Jerusalem could now claim royal back-
ing."—Kidner, Ezra & Nehemiah, p. 78.
  Was Hanani talebearing by reporting bad news? To whom
and how do you report bad news you hear about your de-
nomination and local church? What are your motives for
repeating it? How should we react when we read and hear
reports of spiritual decline and backward steps in the church?


                                                              49

A PATRIOT PRAYS—A VISION IS BORN (Neh. 1:4-11).

   Briefly review yesterday's lesson. We might well ask the
question, Why would Artaxerxes suddenly reverse his good-
will toward Ezra and favor the Samaritans (Ezra 4:21-23)? The
political situation in the Persian Empire helps to answer this
question. Mega Byzus, Artaxerxes' brother-in-law, reconquered
Egypt in a campaign that lasted from 456 to 454 B.C. Mega
Byzus also ruled over the large territory lying between the
Euphrates and Egypt. This territory included Judah. When
Artaxerxes ordered the execution of Inarus, the Egyptian ruler
who surrendered to Mega Byzus on the latter's promise that
his life would be spared, Mega Byzus led a revolt against
Artaxerxes. This revolt occurred about 450 B.C. Mega Byzus
defeated the two armies Artaxerxes sent, making the revolt an
even greater threat to the Medo-Persia Kingdom. It is prob-
ably during the time of this revolt that the Samaritans and
Artaxerxes dealt directly with each other, bypassing the higher
levels of administration to embarrass Mega Byzus at the ex-
pense of the Jews.

   Describe Nehemiah's reaction to Hanani's news. Neh.
1:4. Study his prayer according to the following:


     The substance of his prayer (Neh. 1:6, 7)


     The promise he claimed (verses 8, 9)


   The plan he was formulating for which he desired God's
blessing (verse 11)


   Answered prayer. As Nehemiah prayed over the next few
months, a vision began to grow within him. Maybe the Lord
could use him to answer his own prayer. Later he was to say
that God had put the answer to his prayer in his heart (Neh.
2:12).

  Can you share a time when God used you to answer your
own prayers? How did this strengthen your relationship
with Him? What does Nehemiah's prayer teach us about the
principles of active prayer?

A DIPLOMATIC APPEAL (Neh. 2:1-6).
  How long did Nehemiah pray and plan before he actually
approached the king about his concern for Jerusalem? Com-
pare Neh. 1:1 with 2:1.

   Nehemiah heard the bad news about Jerusalem in the month
of Chisleu, the ninth month of the Jewish religious year. Chisleu
began at the new moon of November or December. But he did
not mention his concern to Artaxerxes until the month of
Nisan, the first month of the Jewish religious year, which
began with the new moon of March or April. For four months
Nehemiah prayed, planned, and waited for a favorable op-
portunity.
   Describe the circumstances under which Nehemiah in-
formed the king of his anguish over Jerusalem's condition.
Neh. 2:1. How did Nehemiah explain the reason for his
sadness? Neh. 2:2, 3.

   "Nehemiah, like Esther, had the wisdom to present the
matter first as news of a personal blow, not as a political issue.
At whatever stage in the conversation the city, the place of my
fathers' sepulchres, was revealed to be Jerusalem, the king's
sympathy had been already enlisted, and his readiness to help
already made clear."—Kidner, Ezra & Nehemiah, p. 80.
   The next step. Nehemiah 2:4 brings us to the critical point
of the scene. Tension mounts as Artaxerxes asks Nehemiah,
"What is it you want?" (NIV). We expect an immediate an-
swer, but Nehemiah keeps us waiting as he pauses to offer a
quick prayer. Finally he answers, "If it pleases the king and if
your servant has found favor in his sight, let him send me to
the city in Judah where my fathers are buried so that I can
rebuild it" (verse 5, NIV). Verse 6 records the king's answer.
At last, the king's answer enables a vision to become reality.
   Spontaneous moments of prayer can result from impul-
siveness or from a continual habit of turning to God. Which
is the better motivation? Why? What does it mean to you to
"pray without ceasing" (1 Thess. 5:17)?



                                                                51

PRUDENT PLANNING (Neh. 2:7-9).
   Because the biblical accounts are so action-packed, we tend
to think of Nehemiah as a person of vigorous action and little
thought. Nehemiah 2:7-9 tells us differently.
  What evidence do we have that during his months of
praying Nehemiah also laid careful plans? Neh. 2:6-8.

   A lesson to all Christians. "This example of wise fore-
thought and resolute action should be a lesson to all Chris-
tians. God's children are not only to pray in faith, but to work
with diligent and provident care. They encounter many diffi-
culties, and often hinder the working of Providence in their
behalf, because they regard prudence and painstaking effort
as having little to do with religion. . . . Careful consideration
and well-matured plans are as essential to the carrying for-
ward of sacred enterprises today as in the time of the rebuild-
ing of Jerusalem's walls."—Prophets and Kings, pp. 633, 634.
   Nehemiah took a big chance when he, the king's cupbearer,
asked the king whether he could leave his employ. His
success could have made him self-centered and proud. But
to whom did Nehemiah credit his success? Neh. 2:8.

   What value is there in visiting in the community to report
on God's work and to invite others to assist? How do you
think Nehemiah would regard Ingatherng?

   "Some may question the propriety of receiving gifts from
unbelievers. Let such ask themselves: 'Who is the real owner
of our world? . . .' God has an abundance in our world, and
He has placed His goods in the hands of all, both the obedient
and the disobedient. He is ready to move upon the hearts of
worldly men, even idolaters, to give of their abundance for
the support of His work; and He will do this as soon as His
people learn to approach these men wisely and to call their
attention to that which it is their privilege to do."—Southern
Watchman, March 15, 1904. [Quotations from Southern Watch-
man are reprinted in a booklet titled Lessons From the Life of
Nehemiah, available from the E. G. White Estate at the General
Conference for $1.50.1

WILLING COOPERATION (Neh. 2:9-18).
   Once in Jerusalem, Nehemiah worked swiftly. On the third
night after his arrival, he and a few select persons toured the
devastated areas (Neh. 2:11-16). After his tour, he could better
plan just how to execute the needed repairs as quickly as
possible.
   "Mounted on his mule, he moved about by moonlight sur-
veying the ruined walls and broken gates of the city of his
fathers. . . . Memories of Israel's past glory stood out in sharp
contrast with the evidence of her present degradation."
   "With sorrow-stricken heart, the visitor from afar gazed
upon the ruined defenses of his loved Jerusalem. And is it not
thus that angels of heaven survey the condition of the church
of Christ? Like the dwellers at Jerusalem, we become accus-
tomed to existing evils, and often are content while making no
effort to remedy them. But how are these evils regarded by
beings divinely illuminated? Do not they, like Nehemiah, look
with sorrow-burdened heart upon ruined walls, and gates
burned with fire?"—Southern Watchman, March 22, 1904.
   How tactfully did Nehemiah motivate the leaders and
people to respond to the opportunity God had given them to
restore the nation? Neh. 2:17, 18.

   Although a newcomer, Nehemiah identified with the people:
"The distress that we are in" (Neh. 2:17, italics supplied). That
"distress" was not the city's insecurity, but the disgrace that
rested on both God and His people (verse 17). He suggested
that they renew the building program. But before they could
object, Nehemiah went on to explain how God had opened a
door of opportunity and that Artaxerxes had authorized him
to restore the city's walls and gates. The announcement stirred
the people into action.
   "The holy energy and high hope of Nehemiah were com-
municated to the people. As they caught the spirit, they rose
for a time to the moral level of their leader. Each, in his own
sphere, was a sort of Nehemiah; and each strengthened and
upheld his brother in the work."—Southern Watchman, March
29, 1904.
  What principles for witnessing can we learn from
Nehemiah's experience?


                                                               53

FURTHER STUDY: Nehemiah's faith and courage grew as he
continued to pray. How might prayer have benefited the people
we read about in the following passages? Mark 14:32-41, 66-
72; Gen. 12:11-20.
  Read "A Man of Opportunity" and "The Builders on the
Wall" in Prophets and Kings, pp. 628-638.

   "There is need of Nehemiahs in the church today—not men
who can pray and preach only, but men whose prayers and
sermons are braced with firm and eager purpose. The course
pursued by this Hebrew patriot in the accomplishment of his
plans is one that should still be adopted by ministers and
leading men. When they have laid their plans, they should
present them to the church in such a manner as to win their
interest and co-operation. Let the people understand the plans
and share in the work, and they will have a personal interest
in its prosperity. . . . The spirit manifested by the leader will
be, to a great extent, reflected by the people."—Southern Watch-
man, March 29, 1904.

  1. What in this lesson should encourage us to believe that
     God can change people's hearts and lead them to do His
     bidding?

     2. What is the relationship between prayer and action that
        God would have us see in this lesson?

     3. After this week's lesson, how would you answer the
        questions in Sabbath's Key Question?

          Building in Faith


          ad'
Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Nehemiah 3, 4, 6.
  MEMORY TEXT: "I sent messengers to them with this
  reply: 'I am carrying on a great project and cannot go
  down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and go
  down to you?" (Nehemiah 6:3, NIV).
   KEY QUESTIONS: Why is it that, when working for God,
we often face opposition? How should we react to opposition
if our course is correct?
   A SENSE OF DIRECTION. Teenager Tonia Valleta lives
by dreams and goals. These provide direction to her develop-
ing abilities. Tonia lost both her eyes to cancer at the age of
two. But this tragedy has not suppressed her spirit. The sports-
minded youngster presently holds six national swimming
records for blind persons; she was a member of two relay
teams that set world records.
   "The biggest problem I've had," Tonia says, "has been
learning to swim straight. I had to develop a sense of direc-
tion."—Washington Post, January 25, 1990.
   In effect, Tonia churns through the water by faith, not by
sight. It is the goal she sees in her mind that drives her down
the swimming lanes to success.
   The people of Judah caught the vision of a restored Jerusa-
lem. By faith they saw what the city would become. As you
study this lesson, ask yourself, What vision does faith help me to
see?
                                                               55

BUILDERS ON THE WALL (Nehemiah 3).
   Since part of ancient Jerusalem lies beneath the present
city, it is impossible to determine the exact location of its
walls in Nehemiah's time. Their length is variously estimated
to have been from two to three miles (3.2 to 4.8 kilometers; see
SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 408; Prophets and Kings, p.
639). No information is given about their height. For an ex-
ample of the teamwork it took to rebuild the walls, read
Nehemiah 3:6-8. The entire chapter reads much the same way.
   Concerted effort. Nehemiah 3 contains an intriguing list of
names and places that reveal a highly organized effort en-
gaged in by people from all areas of life. Merchants (verses 31,
32), craftsmen (verse 8), family units (verse 12), temple serv-
ants (verse 26), and others, all combined their strength to
finish the task.
   Such organization is an outline for successful church growth.
(Compare Luke 9:13, 14; 10:20.) People of all talents organized
into groups, and each group performed a specific work. Team
effort brought the building project to a successful completion.
   Which group led the way? Neh. 3:1. Why was it important
for this group to show such leadership?

   Which group willingly repaired two sections of the wall?
Neh. 3:5, 27. What indicates that resistance to Nehemiah's
leadership was beginning to grow?

   "In every religious movement there are some who, while
they cannot deny that the cause is God's, still hold themselves
aloof. . . . It is well for such ones to remember the record kept
on high—that book in which . . . every neglected opportunity
to do service for God is recorded; and there, too, every deed
of faith and love is held in everlasting remembrance."—Prophets
and Kings, p. 639.
  When calls are made in your church for cooperative ef-
fort, do you respond as willingly as the Tekoites, or do you
hang back like their nobles? How can you tap the source of
Nehemiah's enthusiasm?

FACING CONTEMPT AND RIDICULE (Neh. 4:1-6).

  How did Israel's enemies react to the rebuilding of the
walls? Neh. 2:9, 10, 19; 4:1-3.


   Archeological discoveries have clarified the positions and
influence of Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem. Sanballat was the
governor of Samaria. Tobiah was an Ammonite official, of
noble family and possibly of half-Jewish descent. Geshem was
the king of Qedar in Arabia, controlling also at that time the
territories of Moab, Edom, and the approaches to Egypt. Al-
though subject to the Persian Empire, Judah was encircled on
the north, east, and south by people hostile to her existence,
people who could resort to a "war of nerves" even though
they could not openly violate Artaxerxes' authorization to
Nehemiah.

   A feeble attempt. Sanballat's mockery of God's people in
the presence of his troops might have frightened a lesser
leader. In reality, this rage was only a cover. Sanballat had no
official authority to change the king's authorization and com-
mission to Nehemiah. He could only hope that such ridicule
would weaken Nehemiah's determination.

  Summarize Nehemiah's response to Sanballat's and
Tobiah's insults. Neh. 4:4, 5. Do you see his reaction as a
model for Christians? How did Christ respond to mockery?
Matt. 26:47-50, 67; 27:27-31, 37-44; Luke 23:46.


   Such insults and contempt could not but sting Nehemiah's
feelings. Yet the patriot does not reply in kind. Once again, he
finds courage by talking to God in prayer. The honor of God
and of the builders is being besmirched. Nehemiah's prayer is
similar to the plea of the martyrs of later centuries: "How
long, 0 Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge
our blood on them that dwell on the earth?" (Rev. 6:10).

   Why weren't the workers discouraged? Neh. 4:6.


   How does having a noble purpose help us to bear criti-
cism and opposition? What happens to people when they
are not focused?

                                                              57

THWARTING THREATS OF INVASION (Neh. 4:7-23).
   The war of words turns into a war of nerves when rem-
nants of the Philistine nation (the Ashdodites) join the alli-
ance. Now the Jews are completely encircled by enemies:
Samaritans to the north; Ammonites to the east; Arabians to
the south; and Philistines to the west.
   What did this alliance propose to do? Neh. 4:7, 8, 11.
Summarize Nehemiah's reaction to this new threat. Verses
9, 13, 14.

   Ten different times, Nehemiah heard rumors concerning
this impending attack (verse 12). But his prayers helped him
maintain his courage (verse 9). Momentarily, he halted the
building program and armed the people, deploying them in
family groups at the weakest points in the city's defenses
(4:13). He charged them to remember that their strength was
in the Lord and to fight for their brethren, sons and daugh-
ters, their wives and homes (verse 14). Nehemiah's decisive
action robbed the alliance of the element of surprise, and they
did not press their plan to invade (verse 15).
   How did Nehemiah once again show his ability to plan
and organize when he realized that armed invasion would
remain a threat until they had reconstructed the city's de-
fenses? Neh. 4:15-21.

   "God shall fight for us. Nehemiah's confidence in divine
help was contagious. He himself set a noble example, not only
for his own people, but also for us in our mortal combat with
the powers of evil. We can be confident that God will fight
for us when we labor earnestly to build up His cause, when
we attempt to overcome Satan, sin, and self, and when our
motives are pure, our trust strong, and our weapons
untarnished."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 411.
   Discouragement is one of Satan's fiery darts (Eph. 6:16).
Nehemiah's vigorous action prevented the builders from
slipping into such a state. What can you learn from his
experience that will keep you from becoming a despondent
Christian?

HIGH-LEVEL ACCUSATIONS OF TREASON (Neh. 6:1-14).

  Nehemiah 6 portrays three attempts of sabotage and trea-
son aimed at the very life of Nehemiah. Realizing Nehemiah
was the driving force behind the campaign to restore Jerusalem's
walls, his enemies sought to destroy him and his work.

    Attempt No. 1: Neh. 6:1-4. Ono was about 27 miles north-
west of Jerusalem. Perhaps Sanballat and Gesham were im-
plying that this city's pleasant climate would give the patriot
a chance to relax as he conferred with his fellow "governors."
Perhaps a conference that discussed the mutual needs of their
respective districts could defuse the hostility. The invitation
appeared gracious. But Nehemiah was quick to read "between
the lines" and respond with the words of this week's Memory
Text. The "conference" would have cost him precious days.
Furthermore, because Ono was in the border area of the
Ashdodites and the Samaritans, the patriot perceived that
these men intended "to do me mischief"—perhaps kidnap-
ping or even murdering him. Sanballat's insistence exposed
his intent.
    Attempt No. 2: Neh. 6:5-9. Geshem (Gashmu) alleged to
have heard a rumor that Nehemiah was building the defenses
of Jerusalem so he could make himself king. Sanballat sug-
gested that Artaxerxes would soon hear of such a report. No
one was better aware of the capricious monarch than Nehemiah,
his cupbearer. If the king were to receive such a report, Judah
would fall under the royal wrath.
    Attempt No. 3: Neh. 6:10-14. Shemaiah's confinement may
have been a symbolic act to underscore his alleged oracle that
Nehemiah was about to be assassinated and should take ref-
uge within the holy place. Because Nehemiah was not a priest,
such an act would have been a desecration worthy of death.
    "The least indication of fear on Nehemiah's part at this
critical time would have been fatal to the morale of the people.
. . . One false step, and he would have been lost, his influence
would have been gone, and the work on which his heart was
set would have come to nought."—SDA Bible Commentary,
 vol. 3, p. 419.

  The enemy attempts to stop us, just as he tried to stop
Nehemiah. What are some of the diversions that prevent
you from functioning as a church builder? What enabled
Nehemiah to remain firm? Neh. 6:9. Make Nehemiah's prayer
you own.

                                                              59
Thursday                                   November 18
DIVIDED LOYALTIES (Neh. 6:15-19).

   The month of Elul (Neh. 6:15), the sixth month of the Jew-
ish religious year (August or September), marked a period of
six months since Nehemiah made his request to the king for
permission to repair the city of his fathers' sepulchers (Neh.
2:3). The last two months had been a time of intense activity,
opposition, and radiant faith.
   Nehemiah and his builders completed their building on
three miles of wall in 52 days—less than two months (Neh.
6:15). Such a feat crowned at last the patient toil of Ezra and
the people who some years earlier had evidently accomplished
a large portion of the work before the Samaritans and Artaxerxes
stopped them (Neh. 1:3; 4:7-23).

   How did the Jews' enemies react, and what did they
specifically acknowledge when they heard that the con-
struction at Jerusalem was completed? Neh. 6:16 (compare
2:19, 20).


   Although unity appeared to prevail among God's people,
what picture of divided loyalties does Nehemiah disclose
that made building difficult and sadly influenced the na-
tion in the years to come? Neh. 6:17-19.


   "The advocates of unpopular truth must expect opposition
from its open enemies; this is often fierce and cruel, but it is
far less dangerous than the secret enmity of those who profess
to be serving God while at heart they are servants of Satan.
While apparently uniting in the work of God, many are con-
nected with His foes; and if in any way crossed in their plans
or reproved for their sins, they court the favor of the enemies
of truth, and open to them all the plans of God's servants and
the workings of His cause. . . . Thus these men of two minds
and two purposes pretend to serve God, and then go over to
the enemy and serve him, as best suits their inclination."
—Ellen G. White, Southern Watchman, May 24, 1904.

   In what ways might you be tempted to lend your support
to persons or agencies that bring division and confusion to
God's cause, although you sincerely profess loyalty and
support of your church? How would you suggest divisions
within the church can be corrected? How can you be sure
you know who is causing disunity?

Friday                                    November 19
FURTHER STUDY: The Israelites needed faith to sustain them
against their enemies' threats. What do the following texts
teach about faith? How do these texts affect your relationship
with God? Rom. 10:17; 1 Cor. 2:5; 2 Cor. 5:7; Eph. 6:13-16;
Heb. 11:1; James 1:3; 2:17.
   Read in Prophets and Kings the last half of "The Builders on
the Wall," pp. 639-645, and "Heathen Plots," pp. 653-660.

   "Bring faith into your experience. Faith lightens every bur-
den, relieves every weariness. Providences that are now mys-
terious you may solve by continued trust in God. Walk by
faith in the path He marks out. Trials will come, but go for-
ward. This will strengthen your faith and fit you for service.
The records of sacred history are written, not merely that we
may read and wonder, but that the same faith which wrought
in God's servants of old may work in us. In no less marked
manner will the Lord work now, wherever there are hearts of
faith to be channels of His power."—Prophets and Kings, p.
175.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Personal attacks on Nehemiah came just as he was about
     to complete his objective (Neh. 6:1). In what twofold
     manner did he meet them? How do you relate to per-
     sonal attacks on your work and character?

   2. Nehemiah influenced others positively. How can your
      words and actions encourage others to do their best for
      Christ? In your congregation, how can you influence
      others to work for Christ in a positive way? How can
      you counteract the divisions that appear?

   3. Nehemiah's prayers helped him maintain his courage.
      How did prayer help Christ maintain His courage? Luke
      6:12; Matt. 14:23; 26:36-46. Contrast Christ's strength
      with the disciples' weakness in Gethsemane. How car
      prayer strengthen your courage?

SUMMARY: Nehemiah and his builders met a determined
array of opponents as they sought to restore the walls and
gates of Jerusalem. Nevertheless, they succeeded in complet-
ing their task. Their secret? Continual prayer, persistence, and
a refusal to be intimidated. They built with vigor because they
believed God would honor their faith.

           Ruthless Religion




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Nehemiah 5.

     MEMORY TEXT: "He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth
     unto the Lord; and that which he hath given will he pay
     him again" (Proverbs 19:17).
   KEY QUESTIONS: Why does the apostle Paul say that
"the love of money is the root of all evil" (1 Tim. 6:10)? What
prompts some Christians at times to make material gain from
the misfortunes of others?
   FLEECING THE FLOCK. Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807-1882)
actively sought to free Italy from foreign rule. He owned a
small farm on the island of Caprera in the Mediterranean Sea,
where he would retire after periods of active duty.
   One evening he sent his men to search for a lost sheep.
About midnight, when they requested permission to call off
the search, Garibaldi decided to look for the lamb himself.
The next morning, his servants discovered him asleep, his
arms clutching the lost sheep to his bosom!
   One of the crimes that brought on the Babylonian captivity
of Judah was shameless exploitation of the people by their
leaders (see Eze. 34:2-6; Micah 3:1-3). Instead of shepherding
with concern and compassion, they "fleeced" the Lord's flock,
taking advantage of their helplessness. To Nehemiah's aston-
ishment, a similar oppression suddenly surfaced among his
workers. As you study this week's lesson, ask yourself how
you can be extricated from the grip of materialism.

ECONOMIC DISTRESS (Neh. 5:1-5).

   Summarize the cry of outrage that occurred among God's
people during the national effort to build the wall. Neh. 5:1-
4. What made this a particularly dangerous situation?


   The situation was especially serious because it divided Jew
against Jew at a time when their enemies were attempting to
crush their resolve to rehabilitate the capital.
   "One class of people complained of families so large that it
was impossible to provide them with food, another of having
mortgaged their property because of famine, a third of having
to resort to the moneylenders in order to pay their taxes, and
a fourth of having fallen into the hands of usurious money-
lenders. These people were suffering, not from the oppression
of foreign tyrants, but from the exactions of their brethren."
—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 413.

  What did the poor have to do to ease their poverty? Why
would this make them bitter? Neh. 5:5.


   Within the law, the rich were practicing a ruthless, pitiless
religion by lending money to their needy fellow citizens, but
taking interest on their loans or securing their lands and pos-
sessions as security. They even took the children of their
debtors as slaves.
   "There appeared no hope of improving their condition, no
way to regain either their lands or their children, no prospect
before them but that of perpetual slavery. And yet they were
of the same nation, children of the covenant equally with their
more favored brethren. They had the same affection for their
children as had the others. Their distress had not been caused
by indolence or prodigality. They had been compelled to con-
tract debts because of the failure of crops, and to pay heavy
taxes."—Ellen G. White, Southern Watchman, May 3, 1904.

   How do you relate to poverty in your family? in the lives
of others? Why didn't the Jews of Ezra's and Nehemiah's
time react to the poverty that existed among them as did the
early Jewish Christians? Acts 4:32-37.




                                                              63

GOD'S PLAN TO HELP THE POOR (Deut. 15:11).

  Ezra's plan—endorsed by the Persian king—was to restore
the civil system of the Mosaic theocracy (Ezra 7:14, 25, 26). In
unsettled times, however, central authority apparently was
not yet strong enough to enforce the law.

   Describe the general command of the Mosaic system that
served as a springboard for more specific laws concerning
care of the poor. Deut. 15:7-11.


  What specific laws enabled the poor to have food on their
tables during hard times? Lev. 19:9, 10 (Deut. 24:19-22; Ex.
23:10, 11).


   How did the Mosaic system provide the poor with finan-
cial assistance? Lev. 25:35-40, 47, 48.


   "The very fact that they were regarded by God as being
members of a holy nation involved the Israelites in a sense of
responsibility towards their fellows, especially the under-
privileged. . . . Thus it was forbidden for an Israelite to ad-
vance a loan at interest to another member of the holy people
(Dt. 23:20), since a loan would normally only be needed in an
emergency of a kind that would make the payment of interest
a difficult and embarrassing matter. . . . The taking of pledges
was governed by strict rules (Dt. 24:10-13; cf. Ex. 22:26-27).
Exploitation of needy persons was prohibited (Dt. 24:14-22)
because it violated the principle of brotherhood which, in a
holy nation, meant that all persons were equal before God,
whatever their social status. Thus members of the body cor-
porate must be treated in a just and humane manner."—R. K.
Harrison, Leviticus, Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries
(Downers Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press, 1980), p. 197.

   How might you be taking advantage of another Christian
in difficult circumstances? Who are the poor persons of
today? (1) The man carrying a sign "I will work for food." (2)
Children born in poverty. (3) Large Adventist families pay-
ing tuition. (4) A single parent struggling to make it on one

SUGGESTED SOLUTION (Neh. 5:6-11).
  What was Nehemiah's reaction to the outcry from the
families who had gathered around him? Neh. 5:6, 7.

  Nehemiah knew that condemnation and censure seldom, if
ever, move people to do right. Some scholars have noted that
the word translated "usury" or "interest" (Neh. 5:7, 10) is
peculiar to Nehemiah and, although related, is not the com-
mon word used elsewhere for "usury." They suggest that the
people's complaint was, not over high interest rates, but over
the lending of money upon the security of their lands and
houses with forfeiture of these basic possessions when cir-
cumstances prevented their making payments.
  Outline the reasoning Nehemiah used to show the nobles
how shabbily they were treating their poorer brethren. Neh.
5:8-10. What solution did he suggest? Verse 11.

   The patriot's first argument shamed the nobles into silence.
Nehemiah said in effect, "We, as far as we have been able,
have been buying the release of our brethren in slavery among
the Gentiles; but you, by contrast, are selling them into slav-
ery! Shouldn't you set a higher example before our Gentile
enemies?" Finally, he identified himself with the rulers and
nobles. Verse 10 reads literally, "I also, my brethren and serv-
ants are lending them silver and grain." He and his party
probably did not charge interest, but now he felt the depths of
the distress many were undergoing.
   The expression "the hundredth part" (Neh. 5:11) is under-
stood by some commentators to refer to the interest charged
on the loans, perhaps 12 percent a year. Others think it refers
to the income that the creditors derived from the property
they held in pledge.
   "It was shown me that those who preside over our insti-
tutions should ever bear in mind that there is a chief direc-
tor, who is the God of heaven. There should be strict hon-
esty in all business transactions in every department of the
work. There must be firmness in preserving order, but com-
passion, mercy, and forbearance should be mingled with
the firmness."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 559.


                                                              65

A NOBLE RESPONSE (Neh. 5:12, 13).
  In what forthright manner did the rulers and nobles re-
spond to Nehemiah's plea? Neh. 5:12.

   When the Spirit of God moves on the heart, it releases one's
selfish grasp and urges the sharing of resources with those
who are less fortunate. It will also prompt a retracing of steps
to right previous wrongs. The actions of Zacchaeus (Luke
19:8) are similar to the actions of the rulers and nobles in
Nehemiah's day who publicly promised to restore, without
further charge, the lands and homes of their brethren that
they had taken as security.
   "The Christian in his business life is to represent to the
world the manner in which our Lord would conduct business
enterprises. In every transaction he is to make it manifest that
God is his teacher. 'Holiness unto the Lord' is to be written
upon daybooks and ledgers, on deeds, receipts, and bills of
exchange. . . .
   "If we have injured others through any unjust business
transaction, if we have overreached in trade, or defrauded
any man, even though it be within the pale of the law, we
should confess our wrong, and make restitution as far as lies
in our power. It is right for us to restore not only that which
we have taken, but all that it would have accumulated if put
to a right and wise use during the time it has been in our
possession."—The Desire of Ages, p. 556.
   What visual aid did Nehemiah use to underscore the
seriousness of the oath that the nobles and rulers had taken?
How did the congregation respond? Neh. 5:13.

   A crisis was averted that could have shattered the nation
and left the people open to ridicule by their enemies. If Nehemiah
had waited for the problem to go away, a civil war might have
ensued. His willingness to right terrible wrongs and promote
a spirit of charity and brotherly love helped save the day.
  Why do some persons claim that it is impossible for a
Christian to practice Christian principles in the business
world? How would you refute their logic? How can you
practice Christian principles more thoroughly in your busi-
ness dealings?

EXAMPLE LEADERSHIP (Neh. 5:14-19).
   There is truth in the old saying: "Power corrupts, and
absolute power corrupts absolutely." Not many—even within
the church—can properly relate to the authority, power, and
privilege that comes with high position. So Jewish nobles and
rulers gave in to greedy practices that their position made
possible. The example of Nehemiah's leadership appears in
marked contrast.
   To what position did the king evidently appoint Nehemiah
when he gave him permission to restore Jerusalem? Neh.
5:14. Perceiving the condition of the people, what privileges
of his position did he willingly forego? Neh. 5:14-16.

   Nehemiah had a shepherd's heart. His arms of compassion
embraced his distressed flock. He would not, could not take
advantage of them. He spent and was spent with a willing
heart for the well-being of his people. His example was lead-
ership at its best, self-sacrificing, forceful, and successful. Re-
flect upon how the same can be said of Christ.
  Although Nehemiah did not accept the revenue of a gov-
ernor, what evidence is there that he maintained a hospi-
table court at his own expense? Was he being boastful in
recalling before God the years of his self-denying rule? Can
you identify a higher motivation? Neh. 5:17-19.

   Hospitality and sharing are means in our hands to attract
others to the Saviour we love.
   "We are near the close of time, when Satan has come down,
having great wrath, knowing that his time is short. . . . The
warfare has been left in our hands by our great Leader for us
to carry forward with vigor. We are not doing a twentieth
part of what we might do if we were awake. The work is
retarded by love of ease and a lack of the self-denying spirit of
which our Saviour has given us an example in His life."
—Testimonies, vol. 3, p. 407.
   Many today are sensitive about personal rights. But little
is said about responsible self-denial. What motivates a life
of self-denial such as Nehemiah lived? What kind of leader-
ship do you display in your church and neighborhood?

                                                                 67

FURTHER STUDY: While the Israelites were rebuilding the
walls of Jerusalem, the serious matter of the rich oppressing
the poor arose. What similar situation occurred in the New
Testament, and how did the people resolve it? Acts 6:1-7.
How do the following texts help us to understand the impor-
tance of caring for the poor? Matt. 19:16-22; 25:31-46; Isa. 58:1-
11
   Read "A Rebuke Against Extortion" in Prophets and Kings,
pp. 646-652.

   "The customs of the world are no criterion for the Chris-
tian. He is not to imitate their sharp practise, overreaching,
and extortion, even in small matters. Every unjust act toward
a fellow mortal, though he be the veriest sinner, is a violation
of the golden rule. Every wrong done to the children of God is
done to Christ Himself in the person of His saints. Every
attempt to advantage one's self by the ignorance, weakness,
or misfortune of another, is registered as fraud in the ledger
of heaven."—Ellen G. White, Southern Watchman, May 10,
1904.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How might the laws studied in Monday's lesson relieve
     poverty conditions existing today? In areas where there
     is little farming, what can people do to assist the pow
     with their need for food?

     2. How is Deuteronomy 15:7-11 similar to the golden rule?
        See Leviticus 19:18; Matthew 7:12.

     3. Nehemiah did not condemn those he wished to change.
        How might following his example increase church mem-
        bership and prevent some from leaving through the back
        door?

     4. What did Nehemiah do to avert a crisis? Would these
        steps work in our churches today?

   SUMMARY: Unjust and oppressive financial transactions
threatened the success of Nehemiah's building program and
the well-being of the nation. The experience underlines the
truth that our business dealings do not lie outside our reli-
gious beliefs. Religion and morality are to operate in the
marketplace six days a week as well as in the house of God
on Sabbath. The golden rule is the Christian guide.

Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Nehemiah 8-10.

  MEMORY TEXT: "They clave to their brethren, their nobles,
  and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in
  God's law, which was given by Moses the servant of
  God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the
  Lord our Lord, and his judgments and his statutes"
  (Nehemiah 10:29).

   KEY QUESTION: Why is it necessary for a Christian to
take stock occasionally of his or her spiritual experience?

   REHABILITATION. In 1989 a medical team in Sweden
successfully grafted several thousand fetal brain cells—enough
to fill a large teardrop—into the brain of a patient with
Parkinson's disease. Implanted fetal tissue grows easily and
provokes no rejection by the body. In this instance, the cells
generate and release dopamine, a chemical essential for nor-
mal muscle movement. Previously unable to walk, the patient
has since personally renovated his home. (Washington Post,
March 27, 1990.)
   Under the influence of the Holy Spirit, the "implanted word"
(James 1:21, RSV) can in like manner bring about a new spir-
itual life. This is what occurred in the early months of Nehemiah's
governorship. While the builders labored to rehabilitate Jerusa-
lem, God's Spirit worked to rehabilitate the builders! Ask
yourself in what way your spiritual life needs renewing.

                                                                69
Sunday                                      November 28
NEW YEAR'S DAY, 444 B.C. (Neh. 8:1-12).

   Immediately after the people finished constructing Jerusalem's
walls, they assembled in the city to celebrate the new year. In
less than a week they would observe the Day of Atonement and
the harvest Feast of Tabernacles. These events were the most
spiritually moving occasions of Nehemiah's governorship.

  Describe how the Jews celebrated the new year. On this
occasion in particular, how did they celebrate it? Lev. 23:24,
25; Neh. 8:1-5.


   Ezra's quiet teaching of the Scriptures during the previous
13 years was beginning to have its effect. The people them-
selves requested their spiritual leader to read to them from
the Pentateuch (Neh. 8:1).
   New Year's Day was also referred to as the Blowing of
Trumpets. The sound of these instruments alerted the people
to the solemn events of the approaching Day of Atonement.
   The 13 men who stood with Ezra (verse 4), probably priests,
took turns with him in reading. The 13 additional men (verse
7) were probably Levites who stood level with the people and
may have moved among them to explain the readings. Since
the meeting lasted about five or six hours (verse 3), it is
doubtful that Ezra and his associates read without a break or
that the people continually stood. More likely, the reading
alternated with explanations by the Levites, during which the
congregation was seated.

  How did this public study of the Scriptures affect the
people? What did Nehemiah, Ezra, and the Levites encour-
age the people to do? Neh. 8:5, 6, 9-12.


   Sorrow for our sins has its proper place and time, but the
center of biblical religion is God's graciousness. Nehemiah
declared, "Let there be no sadness, for joy in the Lord is your
strength" (Neh. 8:10, NEB).
   "Those who abide in Jesus will be happy, cheerful, and
joyful in God."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 626.

   What kind of Bible study makes your heart tender and
repentant? Why can your spiritual rehabilitation not take
place without a contrite heart? (See Ps. 51:17.)

Monday                                    November 29
A TIME FOR REJOICING (Neh. 8:13-18).

   The day after New Year's, only the heads of families
reassembled to listen to the reading of Scripture (Neh. 8:13).
The people had dispersed to their homes after the service of
the previous day. Scripture omits reference to the observance
of the Day of Atonement, but "at the time appointed—on the
tenth day of the seventh month—the solemn services of the
Day of Atonement were performed, according to the com-
mand of God."—Prophets and Kings, p. 665.

  As these leaders continued their Bible study, what festi-
val did they determine to observe, and what preparations
did they make for it? Neh. 8:14, 15.


   During their continued study, the "chief of the fathers"
realized that they had lost sight of the Feast of Tabernacles.
The Jews in the first migration celebrated it more than 90
years earlier (Ezra 3:11). But perhaps they had observed it
only in a general way.

   What evidence is there that the people entered heartily
into the celebration of the Feast of Tabernacles? Neh. 8:16,
17. How did they spend the seven days of this festival? Neh.
8:18.


   The study of the Scriptures began on New Year's Day and
continued daily throughout the Feast of Tabernacles. It must
have been like a giant camp meeting, with the people living in
booths made from branches (tents) and attending services at
which priests and Levites read and explained the Word of the
Lord. Reoriented to the compass of God's Word, the families
of Israel—parents and children—were becoming a Bible-
centered people. Ezra and Nehemiah did not intend the people
to become worshipers of a book, but to be keen followers of
their Creator and Redeemer revealed therein. As Jesus later
said: "The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and
they are life" (John 6:63). So the Word of God—studied and
assimilated—promotes vigorous spiritual life.

   How can we obtain that hungering for God's Word that
Israel had under the guidance of Ezra and Nehemiah? How
can we help someone else love it?

Tuesday                                     November 30
REPENTANCE, CONFESSION, AND PRAISE (Neh. 9:1-6).
  Two days after the Feast of Tabernacles, the Jews separated
themselves from their pagan friends, donned sackcloth, and
appeared before the wooden platform that Ezra had used.
Here they wished to confess and repent of their sins. This
meeting was a special time for Israel to be alone with God.
Pagan friends would not have understood. And their pres-
ence would have distracted the people from their self-
examination and confession.
  How was God's Word involved in this meeting? After
their study, what did the people do? Neh. 9:2, 3.

   "Why confess the sins of their fathers? It is to be remem-
bered that this was a national gathering for national humilia-
tion, introductory to a better national life. In such an assembly
a review of the nation's sins would be very appropriate and
profitable. It recalled the great cause of past national suffer-
ing, and of present degradation and subjection. It brought
into light what must be avoided if better times were to arise. It
produced the personal conviction of participation in the sins
of those gone before, and the necessity of abandoning them. It
enhanced the feeling of the great forbearance and mercy of
God towards their nation."—"Homiletics," on Nehemiah 1:1-3,
Pulpit Commentary (Chicago: Wilcox & Follett Company, n.d.),
vol. 15, p. 97.
   Two groups of Levites were involved in this special serv-
ice. Describe what both groups did. Neh. 9:4, 5. Summarize
the content of the people's song. Verses 5, 6.

   Since the first group of Levites are said to have "cried with
a loud voice unto the Lord," they may have closed the season
of public confession and prayer from the platform with prayer
while the people remained kneeling. When their praying ceased,
the second band of Levites called the people to stand and
praise the Lord in singing.
   How do you express appreciation and gratitude for what
the Creator-Redeemer has done for you? What should par-
ticipation in congregational hymn singing mean to you?

RECALLING GOD'S GRACIOUS ACTS (Neh. 9:7-35).
   Most commentators regard Ezra 9:7-35 as a prayer by Ezra
because in Nehemiah 9:6 the Septuagint (the Greek translation
of the Hebrew Bible) inserts the phrase "and Ezra said." Ellen
White writes that in these verses the leaders relate Israel's
history. (See Prophets and Kings, p. 666.) These verses are both
a historical recital and a prayer. Ezra 9:7-35 divides into the
following two parts.
   Part 1: Verses 7-25 describe how God guided in the forma-
tion of their nation. Recalling God's guidance in the past is a
healthy corrective against the self-centeredness of human na-
ture. Wrote Ellen White, "We have nothing to fear for the
future except as we shall forget the way the Lord has led
us."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 31.
   Verses 15-25 record God's blessing to Israel during the
Exodus and their 40 years in the wilderness. But it also lists
Israel's failures. Note below some of each.

    "Throughout this miraculous pilgrimage, 'they lacked nothing'
. . . and appreciated nothing. . . . This part of their history ends
with an undeserved and unstinted inheritance, 'full of all
good things.' "—Kidner, Ezra & Nehemiah, p. 112.
  Part 2: Verses 26-35 focus on the judges, the monarchy, and
how Israel slew the prophets who sought to turn them back to
God (verses 26, 30). Verse 32 mentions that God permitted
Assyria to rule over the nation.
  The Israelites did not blame God for their past. In clos-
ing, what did they admit and confess? Neh. 9:33.

  Just as the rocky coastline continually throws back the
ocean's waves, so Israel had vigorously rejected the great
surges of divine love. The people to whom Ezra and Nehemiah
ministered were not present when their ancestors sinned, but,
without genuine repentance, the tendencies of their own lives
would have led them in the same direction.
  What is wrong with your repentance and confession when
you blame God or others for your unfortunate condition?

                                                                  73
Thursday                                      December 2
COVENANT RELATIONSHIPS RENEWED (Neh. 9:36-
10:29).
   As the people ended their time of confession, they admit-
ted the despicable state of their nation. They were now serv-
ants in a land they once possessed.
  What did the assembly determine to draw up and sign?
Neh. 9:36-38; 10:1. Summarize the document. Neh. 10:29.

   Tirshatha (Neh. 10:1) is a Persian loan-word meaning "gov-
ernor." Zidkijah was most likely Nehemiah's secretary. The
people were so determined to serve God that a simple oral
commitment would not suffice. They wanted to express the
intent of their sacred vow through a written document they
could sign. Eighty-four leading citizens attached their names
by seal. Twenty-one heads of priestly families (verses 2-8)
together with 17 heads of Levitical families (verses 9-13) signed
the covenant. The remaining 44 names belonged to heads of
important families.
   How did the others signify their intention to enter into
this solemn covenant with God? Neh. 10:28, 29.

   Wives and mature children (verse 28) participated with
the men in the oral oath and curse of their covenant, thus
making it a family affair as well as a national one.
   "Nehemiah's efforts to restore the worship of the true God
had been crowned with success. As long as the people were
true to the oath they had taken, as long as they were obedient
to God's word, so long would the Lord fulfill His promise by
pouring rich blessings upon them. . . .
   "Every true turning to the Lord brings abiding joy into the
life. When a sinner yields to the influence of the Holy Spirit,
he sees his own guilt and defilement in contrast with the
holiness of the great Searcher of hearts. . . . He may rejoice in
the sense of sins forgiven, in the love of a pardoning heavenly
Father."—Prophets and Kings, p. 668.
  If you were to recall your past life, what would it show
about your relationship to God? What are your priorities? If
you were to draw up a written covenant with God, what
would you include?

74
Friday                                       December 3
FURTHER STUDY: What do the following verses say about
the necessity of confession and repentance? Prov. 28:13;
1 John 1:9; Luke 13:5; Acts 3:19. How willing is God to accept
our confession and repentance? Luke 15:11-24.
   Read "Instructed in the Law of God" in Prophets and Kings,
pp. 661-668.

   "How mistaken are those who imagine that confession of
sin will detract from their dignity, and lessen their influence
among their fellow men. Clinging to this erroneous idea, though
seeing their faults, many fail to confess them, but rather pass
by the wrongs they have done others, so embittering their
own lives, and shadowing the lives of others. It will not hurt
your dignity to confess your sins. Away with this false dig-
nity. Fall on the Rock and be broken, and Christ will give you
the true and heavenly dignity. Let not pride, self-esteem, or
self-righteousness keep anyone from confessing his sin. . . .
Keep nothing back from God, and neglect not the confession
of your faults to your brethren."—Selected Messages, book 1,
pp. 326, 327.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1.In the experience of spiritual renewal, how specific should
     an individual's repentance, confession, and commitment
     be?

   2. In Nehemiah 9:5-37, the Jews listened reverently to a
      recital of their history. How often do you recall the
      Lord's leading in your life? In what major events or
      decisions was He directly involved? Why is such an
      exercise a helpful work of grace?

   3. What value do you see in corporately admitting the
      failures of our spiritual ancestors, confessing the sins
      and tendencies of our lives, and entering into a new
      covenant with God to live entirely for Him and to finish
      the work He has committed to us?

SUMMARY: All Israel participated in the special services of
the seventh month: New Year's Day, the Day of Atonement,
and the Feast of Tabernacles. At this time, several days of
intense Scripture study led to recalling Israel's historical ex-
perience. A revival resulted as people confessed their sins and
renewed their covenant with God. Prayerful study of the
Scriptures by today's church and putting away sinful prac-
tices will bring like results for us.

Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Nehemiah 7:1-73; 10:30-
39; 11:1-36; 12:1-47; 13:1-31.
     MEMORY TEXT: "We will not forsake the house of our
     God" (Nehemiah 10:39).
  KEY QUESTIONS: What is the difference between a re-
vival and a reformation? Can a reformation succeed without
revival? Does a revival amount to anything without reform?
How can both be obtained and maintained?
   REAL REFORM. A 40-year-old woman declared to a well-
known counselor after a devastating experience and heart
attack, "My life has taken a 180-degree turn." She quit smok-
ing, joined a Weight Watchers Club, and lost 58 pounds. She
also limited her dietary intake of salt, fat, and cholesterol, and
adopted a daily exercise program. "For the first time in my
life," she wrote, "I know what good health is."
   Unwittingly, this woman became a "reformer." She chose
to adopt certain reforms in her lifestyle. To her amazement
she has discovered a degree of health she never knew before.
Most persons shy away from the idea of "reform." To them
the word seems to fit a sickly asceticism that "enjoys" depre-
ciating the good life. In reality, the reforms that bring us
physically, mentally, or spiritually into harmony with God's
will always result in true happiness. As you study this week's
lesson, ask yourself how you can reform and renew your life.

KEEPING OUR PROMISES TO GOD (Neh. 10:30-39).

   Lesson 10 closed with Jewish leaders and people renewing
their covenant relationship with God. We will now study the
particular pledges made publicly on that solemn occasion.

  List the first four pledges made in connection with the
oath to be loyal to God's will (verse 29). Neh. 10:30, 31.


   These reforms in marriage practices, Sabbath observance,
land management, and business might seem to deny Judah
both wealth and happiness. But "peace is the reward of those
who love thy law," the psalmist affirms (Ps. 119:165, NEB).
   "God does not require us to give up anything that it is for
our best interest to retain. In all that He does, He has the well-
being of His children in view. Would that all who have not
chosen Christ might realize that He has something vastly
better to offer them than they are seeking for themselves. Man
is doing the greatest injury and injustice to his own soul when
he thinks and acts contrary to the will of God. No real joy can
be found in the path forbidden by Him who knows what is
best and who plans for the good of His creatures."—Steps to
Christ, p. 46.

   What provision did the leaders and people agree to make
for supporting the temple services, and how did they decide
to support the priests and Levites? Neh. 10:32-38.


   This promise to pay temple expenses is a healthy sign of
growing spiritual maturity. As the ancient priests were sup-
ported by tithe, so are the church's pastors today. (See 1 Cor.
9:8-14.) Loyalty to the Lord and to His church involves bring-
ing "all the tithes into the storehouse" (Mal. 3:10).

  Summarize the general promise that concluded the
assembly's covenant. Neh. 10:39.


   To what extent are you shouldering the expenses of the
church? Can you truthfully say, "I will not forsake the house
of my God"?

REORGANIZATION OF CITY AND COMMUNITY
(Nehemiah 7, 11).
  Describe the security arrangements Nehemiah made for
the temple and city. Neh. 7:1-3.

   Nehemiah fully realized that prominent families had inter-
married with some of the nation's worst enemies (Neh. 6:17-
19). An appointee from such a family might turn traitor.
Nehemiah knew he could count on Hanani's loyalty.
   Normally, gates were opened at sunrise and closed at sun-
set. But in their present state of insecurity, Nehemiah's order
seems to have meant: open late; close early. Furthermore,
selected civilians were organized into a security force so that
the city was always under guard.
  Palace (verse 2). This probably refers to the temple fortress
on the north side of the sacred area.
   Every one in his watch (verse 3). "The guards were di-
vided into watches, being on duty a certain number of hours
each day and during the night."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol.
3, p. 422.
   What other problem did Nehemiah face, and how did he
solve it? Neh. 7:4, 5; 11:1, 2.

   God's people who returned from Babylon chose to live
near their fields rather than among the ruins of Jerusalem. But
the restored defenses now gave the capital a future and a
function. The national administrators (Neh. 11:1), many from
the tribes of Judah and Benjamin (verse 4), numerous priestly
and Levitical families, as well as the porters and their families
(verses 10, 15, 19), volunteered to live in the city. Nehemiah
evidently used the old registry that Zerubbabel had drawn up
(Ezra 2:1-70) to estimate the current population, a tenth of
whom he now asked to resettle in the capital.
   The names of Christians are written in the "registry" of
the New Jerusalem (see Heb. 12:22-24). What does that fact
mean to you personally (see Luke 10:20)? How may you
have the continuing assurance that your name is retained
there (see Rev. 3:5)?

PROVISIONS FOR TEMPLE WORSHIP (Neh. 12:1-26, 44-47;
13:1-3).
  After the people dedicated themselves to the support of the
temple and its workers, Nehemiah established a system to
channel this support.
   Priestly lists (Neh. 12:1-7, 12-21). It is possible that he used
these lists as a basis upon which he could determine the
distribution of the tithe (see Neh. 10:38). Also, because the
lists have either 21 or 22 family names, he may have wanted
to arrange the priests in the 24 courses of service David had
established for the temple (see 1 Chron. 24:1-24; Luke 1:5).
  How did the leaders carry out the provisions of the cov-
enant to support temple personnel? Neh. 12:44-47.

   Technical aspects of the support system were now in place.
Next, personnel were appointed to oversee the storing and
distribution of tithes and offerings to be divided among the
priests, singers, and the porters of the temple gates.
   What attempt was made to stand free from the surround-
ing pagan influences? Neh. 13:1-3. How can you reconcile
the command that the Ammonites and Moabites "should
not come into the congregation of God for ever" with God's
statement that His house shall be "an house of prayer for all
people" (Isa. 56:7)?

   You will recall that the Israelites were intermarrying with
unconverted Ammonites and Moabites and that the children
of these marriages were forgetting the Jewish language and
thus were unable to read or understand Hebrew Scripture
(Neh. 13:23, 24). Yet, should any Ammonite or Moabite come
as a convert, as Ruth the Moabitess did, that person would
discover that God's house is indeed "an house of prayer for
all people."
   Personal revival and reformation include separating one-
self from sin. This the Israelites did in separating them-
selves from the mixed multitude. To experience revival in
your spiritual life, from what sins do you need to separate
yourself? Ask God now to help you do so.

                                                                 79

DEDICATION OF THE WALL (Neh. 12:27-43).
  After you read Nehemiah 12:27, list words or phrases that
express or imply joy.

   Reformation and revival lead to joy. The priests and Levites
gathered to purify themselves, the people, the gates, and the
walls. The ceremony symbolized the purifying of one's life
from sin—a needed step in any true reformation and revival.
     Describe the great event that occurred next. Neh. 12:31-40.

   Imagine being a member of the congregation that is observ-
ing the grand march of secular and ecclesiastical leaders.
Their lines along the wall encompass you as one group marches
in one direction while the other group marches in the oppo-
site direction. Over your head, musical fanfares pierce the air.
When the two groups meet on the eastern wall opposite the
temple, they descend into the temple courts, where they con-
tinue to praise the Lord and offer sacrifices of thanksgiving
(verses 40-43). What a difference from when the temple cor-
nerstone was laid more than 90 years earlier (Ezra 3:11-13)!
  Compare Nehemiah 12:43 with 12:27. The passage de-
scribing the dedication ends as it began. Notice the words
and phrases in verse 43 that denote joy.

   Does the joy in Nehemiah's Jerusalem seem strange? Per-
haps it is because we subscribe to the theory that the person
who acquires and succeeds is the happiest. But Nehemiah and
Paul knew that joy is spiritual.
   "'Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice' [Phil.
4:41. If we would guard our words, so that nothing but kind-
ness shall escape our lips, we will give evidence that we are
preparing to become members of the heavenly family."—Medical
Ministry, p. 213.
   We usually dedicate lifeless objects, such as churches
and walls, only once. Why is it necessary for us continually
to rededicate ourselves?

NEHEMIAH'S SECOND TERM (Neh. 13:1-31).
   For 12 years Nehemiah governed the province of Judah
(Neh. 5:14; 13:6). But in Artaxerxes' 32nd year (433/432 B.C.),
he returned for a time to the royal court. In his absence, the
promises of the people tragically crumbled like ropes of sand.
   When Nehemiah returned, he found unfaithfulness in four
different areas: (1) priestly behavior; (2) tithing; (3) Sabbath-
keeping; and (4) marriage.
   1. Priestly behavior (Neh. 13:4-9). In Nehemiah's absence
the high priest, Eliashib, provided living quarters in the temple
complex for the God-defying Ammonite, Tobiah.
  Do you think Nehemiah's reaction to this situation was
justified? Why or why not? Neh. 13:8, 9.

   2. Tithing (Neh. 13:10-13). "While the guilt of profaning
the Temple lay especially with the priestly class, that of with-
holding the tithes was mainly chargeable to the rulers and
nobles. As the leaders they had apparently set a bad example
to the people, and were especially to be blamed for the de-
plorable conditions."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 450.
  The tithes were important because the temple services
pointed to the Messiah. Without these services, the Jews
would be in greater danger of forgetting about His coming.
   3. Sabbathkeeping (Neh. 13:15-22). In verse 18, Nehemiah
reminds them that previous violations of the fourth com-
mandment resulted in the Babylon captivity. Compare Jer.
17:21-27; Eze. 22:8, 26; 23:38.
   4. Marriage (Neh. 13:23-26). Concerning mixed marriages,
Nehemiah refers the people to Solomon (verse 26), an ex-
ample "more likely than any other to move the Jews. What
the author of 1 Kings 11:3 had euphemistically referred to as
turning aside of the heart, Nehemiah bluntly and openly calls
'sin.' "—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 452.
   Are there discrepancies in your life regarding any of these
four areas? If so, how can you experience a revival and
reformation? The Lord, through His Holy Spirit, invites and
will empower you to dedicate your all to Him.

                                                               81
Friday                                       December 10
FURTHER STUDY: First Samuel 7:1-6 and 1 Kings 18:17-40
record instances of revival. What major elements are present
in these accounts that are similar to the revival account we
studied this week?
   Read "Reformation," Prophets and Kings, pp. 669-678.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. This week we learned about the importance of God's
     tithe in supporting temple services. How is tithe just as
     important today? In what ways are tithes and offerings a
     sign of our loyalty to God?

     2. Even after Jerusalem's walls were completed, God's people
        still needed to guard against enemies. What enemies
        does the church need to guard against today? What
        enemies do you personally need to guard against? What
        is our best defense?

SUMMARY: Revival and reformation cannot be maintained
if faith is compromised. Apostasy in leadership quickly leads
to apostasy in the ranks. Individual renewal on a daily basis,
resulting in commitment to God and His will, is the only way
we can maintain a consistent, growing Christian life.

          Behind the Story




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ezra 1:1; 9:8; 6:15-18;
Neh. 1:11; 8:1.
  MEMORY TEXT: "The God of heaven, he will prosper
  us; therefore we his servants will arise and build"
  (Nehemiah 2:20).
   KEY QUESTION: "What experience and history teach is
this—that people and governments never have learned any-
thing from history, or acted on principles deduced from it"
(Georg Hegel). While this may be true of secular history, it
need not be true of sacred history. What truths may we learn
from the accounts of Ezra and Nehemiah?
   LIFE SUPPORT. In 1986 Jacqueline Cole suffered a mas-
sive stroke. For 41 days, life-support systems kept her alive.
Her prognosis? "A persistent vegetative state." Mrs. Cole's
husband requested the removal of all life supports. But a
judge refused. Six days later Mrs. Cole awoke! Now, after
four years, she is almost fully recovered.
   The "stroke" of sin rendered the Jews unconscious to God's
love. But because He is merciful, He granted them a reprieve.
The accounts of Ezra and Nehemiah do not merely inform us
about Jewish history. They also awaken in us a deeper under-
standing of the God we love and worship. Behind the history
are truths about God that are important to modern Christians
and the spiritual challenges we face.

GOD'S ACTIVE PRESENCE (Ezra 1:1).

   Today, millions of persons deny the existence of God as the
Bible reveals Him. Even many Christians entertain false views
about Him. But not Ezra and Nehemiah. Their inspired records
breathe His very presence as they trace His guidance in behalf
of Judah.

   How did Ezra and Nehemiah interpret the favor shown to
the Jews by the Persian kings? Ezra 1:1; 6:22; 7:27, 28. In
their activities for Judah, of what were Ezra and Nehemiah
conscious? Ezra 5:5; Neh. 2:8 (compare Ezra 7:6, 9, 28; 8:18,
22, 31; Neh. 2:18).


   While in the midst of tragedy we may cry out, "Where is
God?" the Scriptures disclose a Deity who is not forgetful of
His people or His promises. This is one of the first truths we
learn from the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.

   Discernment and inward conviction. Neither Ezra nor
Nehemiah viewed the events of their lives as subject to chance.
The eye of their God was upon them, and they affirmed that
the hand of the Lord was likewise upon them. This they knew
because of an inward conviction by the Holy Spirit, and espe-
cially by their discernment of God's providences in opening
doors, in resolving overwhelming difficulties, and in deliver-
ing them from their enemies. Their spiritual insight was quick
to recognize God's leading in the events that favored Judah's
restoration.

   What do these historical books teach about the union of
divine and human effort to accomplish God's mission? Neh.
2:18, 20; 4:9, 17, 20 (compare Matt. 28:18, 19).


   "All heaven is waiting for men and women through whom
God can reveal the power of Christianity. The church is God's
agency for the proclamation of truth, empowered by Him to
do a special work; and if she is loyal to Him, obedient to all
His commandments, there will dwell within her the excel-
lency of divine grace."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 600.

  As a Christian, how can you develop and maintain a
sense of God's presence in your life? Ps. 16:8; Heb. 11:27.

Monday                                    December 13
GOD'S REMNANT PEOPLE (Ezra 9:8).

   In Ezra 9:2, 8, the words seed and remnant describe those
who returned to Judah from Babylonian captivity. The "rem-
nant" was as small as a seed compared to the number of
people who could have returned. Less than 50,000 returned in
the first migration and scarcely a sixth of that figure in the
second.

  What inspired policy was essential to the remnant if it
was to succeed in its mission? Ezra 4:3; 10:2, 3, 19; Neh.
10:30; 13:3, 30. What counsel does the New Testament give
regarding this same problem? 2 Cor. 6:14-18.


   The true remnant in Israel was always those who placed
their trust in God and lived in harmony with His will. Such a
people were not only small in numbers, but at God's direc-
tion, separate from the world lest godless cultures engulf
them. The concept of separateness commits God's people to
watchfulness and an unending struggle. Worldly philosophies
and evils always pressured Israel (as they do the church to-
day) and at times succeeded in penetrating her defenses and
marring her spiritual purity.
   "There is constant danger that professing Christians will
come to think that in order to have influence with woridlings,
they must to a certain extent conform to the world. But though
such a course may appear to afford great advantages, it al-
ways ends in spiritual loss."—Prophets and Kings, p. 570.

   Related to the word remnant is the word reform. Into what
reforms did Ezra and Nehemiah lead the remnant of Israel?
Neh. 10:30-39; 13:15-22; 5:7-12. On what does the end-time
"remnant" base its reforms? Rev. 12:17.


   "God's remnant people, standing before the world as re-
formers, are to show that the law of God is the foundation of
all enduring reform."—Prophets and Kings, p. 678.

  As a member of the end-time remnant, how can you be
separate from the world, yet function as "the salt of the
earth" (Matt. 5:13)? How did Jesus mingle with sinners (Luke
19:7) and yet remain separate from them?

GOD'S RESTORED WORSHIP (Ezra 6:15, 16).

  The books of Ezra and Nehemiah emphasize rebuilding the
temple and restoring its worship services.
   Why was temple worship so essential to Israel that the
altar of burnt offering was functioning within a few weeks
after the first group of immigrants arrived in Jerusalem?
Ezra 3:1-3.

  The sacrifices offered in the temple pointed clearly to Jesus,
the Messiah about whom Israel was to tell the world. The
temple "provided the means of grace whereby Israel could
continue to be kept in the bond of [the] covenant. . . . Through
the sanctuary cultus mercy could be obtained for the truly
repentant. Here the confessing Israelite could receive forgive-
ness of sin and release from his guilt. The blessings of the
covenant could be retained, and spiritual growth—restoring
the image of God in his life—could continue."—Frank B.
Holbrook, "The Israelite Sanctuary," The Sanctuary and the
Atonement, A. V. Wallenkampf and W. R. Lesher, eds. (Gen-
eral Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, 1981), p. 13.
   One of the striking features of Ezra and Nehemiah is the
record of the festivals and dedications in which the people
participated. (Review Ezra 3:4, 10; 6:15-17, 19-22; Neh. 8:2, 9,
10, 14-17; 12:27.)
   What would you say was the purpose of the festivals and
dedications? Why is the worship of God important? What
has the Lord asked Christians to remember? Ex. 20:8-11;
1 Cor. 11:24, 25; Rev. 14:6, 7.

  The Sabbath and the Lord's Supper prompt us to "remem-
ber" who the Lord is, what He has done for us, and what He
will do for us in the future. Remembering and praising our
God keeps us resting in peace upon His gracious promises.
  Analyze how you personally observe the Sabbath and the
Lord's Supper. What basic principles should govern the
manner in which we observe these special occasions foi
worship? How can you make them occasions of praise and
joy for yourself, your family, and your friends?

GOD'S RESPONSE TO PRAYER (Neh. 1:11).

  We have seen how the active presence of God pervades the
books of Ezra and Nehemiah. Today we will study how these
records are filled with earnest prayers and God's gracious
answers.

  Describe intercessory prayer. How do we limit a favor-
able answer to this kind of prayer? What examples of inter-
cessory prayer do we read in Ezra and Nehemiah? Ezra 9:5-
15; Neh. 1:4-11.


   Scripture teaches us that we should pray one for another
(Job 42:10; Matt. 5:44; James 5:13-16). Such prayer better en-
ables the Holy Spirit to move upon the hearts of those we pray
for, although God will not violate the will of any person.
Moses and other prophets are known for their intercessions in
behalf of their people. Jesus' great prayer of intercession in-
cluded the apostles and all Christians down to the end of time
(John 17). Prayer changes things, and Ezra was privileged to
see an immediate response in the penitential tears of his people
and their determination to correct their behavior (Ezra 10:1-4).

  Review the types of prayer request in Ezra and Nehemiah.
What are some things these requests teach us about prayer?
Which parts of these prayers can you adapt to your life? (1)
Ezra 8:21-23, 31; (2) Neh. 1:11; (3) Neh. 4:9; (4) Neh. 6:9; (5)
Neh. 13:29; (6) Neh. 13:14.


   "There is no time or place in which it is inappropriate to
offer up a petition to God. . . . In the crowds of the street, in
the midst of a business engagement, we may send up a peti-
tion to God and plead for divine guidance, as did Nehemiah
when he made his request before King Artaxerxes. A closet of
communion may be found wherever we are."—Steps to Christ,
p. 99.

   It is evident that Ezra and Nehemiah lived in an at-
mosphere of prayer. What can you do this week to obtain
a reverent-but-intimate acquaintance with your heavenly
Father and with Jesus, your Saviour and Redeemer? How
can you adjust your daily program so that you and your
family have more time for communion with God?

                                                               87
Thursday                                   December 16
GOD'S WRITTEN WORD (Neh. 8:1).
   A major source of spiritual life is the Word of God studied
under the influence of the Holy Spirit. The Scriptures played a
central role in the revival and reformation of the "remnant" of
Israel in the days of Ezra and Nehemiah. And they are central
to that experience for the remnant today. The life of Christ,
our Redeemer, is in His Word.
  Whom did the Jews recognize as speaking to them in the
written "law of Moses"—the Scriptures? Ezra 7:6; Neh. 8:1.

   Although the people recognized that Moses was God's
penman, it was Yahweh who "had commanded" or "ordered"
His people through the prophet (Neh. 8:1). It was one of
Israel's greatest privileges to be entrusted with the written
Scriptures (Rom. 3:1, 2).
   What evidence is there that the people hungered to hear
the Word of God preached and explained? Neh. 8:1, 2, 13, 18
(compare Matt. 5:6).

  Four characteristics of Israel's remnant stand out in these
accounts: (1) Their smallness. Theirs was not a popular cause
even among their fellow Jews, the majority of whom chose to
remain in their adopted lands. (2) Their separateness. They
knew that compromising their faith would extinguish their
witness. (3) The Scriptures. They accepted the Bible as their
rule of faith and practice. (4) Their success. Repentance, evi-
denced in obedience (active faith), resulted in reformation,
revival, and a successful building program.

  From this point on, the Jews became a "people of the
Book." But they overlooked Christ—the Book's central fo-
cus (John 5:39, 40). How can you become knowledgeable in
God's Word, yet have more than a mere theory of truth?

   "Without the Spirit of God a knowledge of His word is of
no avail. . . . One may be familiar with the commands and
promises of the Bible; but unless the Spirit of God sets the
truth home, the character will not be transformed."—Christ's
Object Lessons, p. 408.

FURTHER STUDY: This week we studied how beneficial it
was for the Israelites to remember their history. The psalmist
also was aware of this benefit. Read Psalm 105. Write a short
psalm of your own, recounting how the Lord has guided in
your life and what Jesus means to you.
   Read "God's Presence a Reality" in Testimonies, vol. 5, pp.
651-654; "The Scriptures a Safeguard" in The Great Contro-
versy, pp. 593-602.

   The value of remembering. "The plan of salvation is glori-
fied before us, and the thought of Calvary awakens living and
sacred emotions in our hearts. Praise to God and the Lamb
will be in our hearts and on our lips; for pride and self-
worship cannot flourish in the soul that keeps fresh in memory
the scenes of Calvary."—The Desire of Ages, p. 661.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How would you summarize the truths we can learn from
     the books of Ezra and Nehemiah? In what way can you
     share these truths with a neighbor, family member, or
     friend?

  2. God's law was the basis of revival and reformation for
     the Israelites who returned from Babylon captivity. In
     what way does God's law serve as the basis of revival
     and reformation in your personal life? Can one experi-
     ence these without following God's law?

SUMMARY: When we look behind Ezra's and Nehemiah's
recital of historical facts, we see God, actively present with
His people. In spite of the tendency for Israel's remnant to
stray, God's eye was upon them, and His providences opened
doors that enabled them to restore His worship. He gra-
ciously heard their prayers and sought to edify them through
the Scriptures, His revealed will.
   All systems are still "Go" in God's plan to revive, restore,
and enable His present-day remnant to fulfill His redemptive
plan through Jesus Christ.

  KEY QUESTIONS: What is the purpose of Bible proph-

   THE CHRISTIAN'S TELESCOPE. On April 25, 1990, the
space shuttle Discovery released the Hubble telescope to begin
a 15-year study of the stars. When fully functional, this great-
est of all telescopes could transmit data equivalent to a 30-
volume encyclopedia in 42 minutes!
   Christians also have a great telescope—the telescope of
Bible prophecy, which focuses on the Star of Jacob "of whom
Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write" (John 1:45).
And just as the space shuttle launched the Hubble telescope,
so God chose Israel to proclaim His prophecies concerning
the Messiah. As a student of Moses' law (Ezra 7:6, 10), Ezra
no doubt peered through the prophetic telescope many times
to discern Israel's exact role. This week we will peer through
this telescope to study the prophecies that inspired the re-
building of Jerusalem. Look for similarities between Israel's
role in announcing the Messiah's first coming and the role of
the Christian church in announcing His second.

PATRIARCHAL EXPECTATIONS (Gen. 3:15).
  In Genesis 3:15 we find one of the earliest prophecies avail-
able to Ezra and to us.
   Write in your own words the meaning of this prophecy
that brought courage to the sorrowing hearts of Adam and
Eve. Who would be the ultimate Seed of the woman? Rev.
12:1-5; Gal. 4:4.

   "Adam and Eve stood as criminals before the righteous
Judge, awaiting the sentence which transgression had incurred;
but before they heard of the life of toil and sorrow which
must be their portion, or of the decree that they must return
to dust, they listened to words that could not fail to give them
hope. Though they must suffer from the power of their mighty
foe, they could look forward to final victory."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, p. 66.
   On his way to offer Isaac as a burnt offering, how did
Abraham answer Isaac's question about the absence of a
sacrificial animal? Gen. 22:8. According to Jesus, what did
Abraham see symbolized in the ram he offered in the place
of Isaac? Gen. 22:13; compare John 8:56.

   In the bleeding ram, dying in Isaac's place, he understood
with gratitude the reality of the future Saviour's atoning death.
"Light was shed upon the mystery of redemption, and even the
angels understood more clearly the wonderful provision that
God had made for man's salvation."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
p. 155.
   According to the books of Moses (which Ezra diligently
taught the people) the Saviour would also be a peace giver
who would rule in the royal line of Judah (Gen. 49:8-11) and a
prophet who would be God's spokesperson (Deut. 18:15-18).
  The patriarchs lived by hope (Rom. 8:24, 25). They could
not look back to Calvary; their prophetic telescope fixed on
a Star that seemed light-years away (Heb. 11:13). As you
look forward to Christ's second coming, how can you keep
your hope bright and meaningful?


                                                               91

LIGHT IN THE SHADOWS (Lev. 17:11, 14; John 1:29).
  From his study of the books of Moses, Ezra learned that
God established the sacrifices as a means to teach His people
about the nature of sin and about the coming Redeemer.
   What was the significance of the sacrificial blood by which
the priests made atonement for sin? Lev. 17:11, 14; John 1:29;
Heb. 9:13, 14.

   Since the blood literally and symbolically stood for the life,
shed blood represented a "life given." The sacrificial animal,
as it were, laid down its life for another: substitution. But
since it was "not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats
should take away sins" (Heb. 10:4), we know that these sacri-
fices foreshadowed the Saviour and His atoning death for the
sins of the world (Dan. 9:24; Heb. 9:26). God forgave the
patriarchs, the Israelites, and all others on the basis of their
faith in the promised Redeemer.
   "Sacrifices were explicitly planned by God Himself to teach
this great and momentous truth, that through the blood of
Christ alone there is forgiveness of sins."—Selected Messages,
book 1, p. 107.
   What did the Israelites learn during the years they lived
in the wilderness? Heb. 4:1, 2. What did the sanctuary insti-
tution foreshadow? Heb. 8:4, 5; 9:24; Col. 2:13-17.

   The New Testament plainly states that Israel learned the
same saving gospel before the advent of the Messiah as Chris-
tians learn today. This fact points to the Israelite sanctuary of
symbols and types as God's visual aid to teach His saving
truths during the pre-Christian ages. The sacrifices and priestly
ministry foreshadowed the Redeemer's atoning death and
priestly ministration of His merits in the heavenly sanctuary.
In this sense, the shadow-types were a kind of prophecy that
focused the faith of the believer on the coming Saviour.
  The visible symbols and rituals of the sacrificial system
helped to make the truths of the gospel real. How can the
saving truths of the gospel be a reality to us, who worshif
without a visual sacrificial system?

PROPHETIC PORTRAYALS (Isa. 53:1-12).

  With the development of the monarchy and the dividing of
the nation into northern and southern kingdoms came the
period of the major and minor prophets. Their combined
oracles compose a colorful portrait of the coming Redeemer.

   According to Micah, one of the earliest prophets, where
would the Messiah be born? Micah 5:2; compare Luke 2:1-
11.


  Isaiah, a contemporary of Micah, is called the gospel
prophet because of his Messianic predictions. Summarize
the roles he attributes to the Messiah. Isa. 9:6, 7.


   "The names [of the Messiah] begin in the past, advance to
the present, and end in the far future. They first bespeak our
reverence and awe, the foundations of religious feeling. They
then call forth our trust, showing Christ to us all-wise, al-
mighty. They end by eliciting our love towards him as a
protecting 'Father,' who will at last conduct us to perfect
peace."—Homiletics on Isaiah 9:6, Pulpit Commentary, vol. 23,
p. 171.

   The most detailed of all Messianic portrayals is Isaiah
52:13-53:12. What two roles in the plan of salvation does
this passage ascribe to the Messiah?


   Isaiah 53 is referred to several times in the New Testament
(Matt. 8:17; John 12:38; 1 Peter 2:23-25, etc.).
    "God designs that men shall not decide from impulse, but
from weight of evidence, carefully comparing scripture with
scripture. Had Israel laid by their prejudice and compared
written prophecy with the facts characterizing the life of Jesus,
they would have perceived a beautiful harmony between the
prophecies and their fulfillment in the life and ministry of the
lowly Galilean."—The Desire of Ages, p. 458.

   Ezra learned much about the coming Saviour from his
study of Scripture. What does God design for you to learn
from Bible prophecy, since so much of Scripture is written
in this form? (See John 14:29.)

                                                              93

"FULLNESS OF TIME" (Ezra 7:1-26; Dan. 9:24-27).

  Ezra 7 establishes the date for "the going forth of the com-
mandment to restore and to build Jerusalem" as 457 B.C.
(Compare Ezra 6:14.) It was not until God's people were in
the closing years of their captivity that God disclosed the
actual time of the Messiah's appearing in one of the most
remarkable prophecies of Scripture.

   What period of time did Gabriel inform Daniel would be
allotted to Israel to accomplish certain objectives? Dan. 9:24.
What were those objectives?


   All Bible scholars are agreed that the time period of 70
weeks cannot be taken as literal time (approximately one
year, four months, and two weeks). In context, a period of less
than a year and one half would make no sense. Since the
vision of Daniel 9 is in reality a continuation of the symbolic
vision of Daniel 8 (see 9:21-23; 8:16, 17, 27), it is appropriate to
apply the year-day principle that is implicit here. A day in
symbolic prophecy represents a literal year (see Num. 14:34;
Eze. 4:6). A period of 490 years (70 weeks x 7 days per week =
490 days = 490 years) was thus allotted to the Jews.
   This could have been Israel's finest hour because it in-
volved the coming of the long awaited, long hoped-for Mes-
siah, who was to come through the line of Abraham, Judah,
and David (Rom. 9:4, 5).

   When would the Messiah make His appearance? Dan.
9:25. Review lesson 5, Thursday's lesson. What happened in
A.D. 27 in Judah? Luke 3:1, 2, 15, 21, 22. How did Jesus
regard this Messianic time prophecy of Daniel? Mark 1:14,
15.


   What would happen to the Messiah in the midst of the
last prophetic week of the prophecy? Dan. 9:26 (first part),
27; Matt. 27:50, 51.


   Why was the Daniel 9 prophecy so important to the Jews
at that point in their history? Why is it important to us? Are
you able to explain it to someone who doesn't understand it
or who has little faith in such matters?

Thursday                                    December 23
THE SILENT YEARS (Mal. 3:1; 4:5).
   Malachi prophesied either just before Nehemiah's second
term as governor or shortly after his second term began.
   Whom did Malachi foretell would bring a reformation in
Israel to prepare for the Messiah's advent? Mal. 3:1; 4:5, 6.
How were these prophecies fulfilled? Luke 1:13-17.

   Chronologically, the books Ezra-Nehemiah and Malachi
close the Old Testament. Approximately four centuries elapsed
between them and the New Testament. During this time there
developed a complex body of traditions and interpretations
that obscured the truths of revelation.
   A little less than 100 years after Nehemiah, the Persian
Empire fell to Grecia and its king, Alexander the Great (331
B.C.). He determined to fuse the East and West through Greek
civilization—a process called hellenization. This process caused
division and confusion in Judah. The Jewish sects known as
the Pharisees, Essenes, and Sadducees developed as reactions
against Greek culture.
   In the name of hellenization, Antiochus IV Epiphanes at-
tempted to obliterate the Jewish faith in 168 B.C. by closing
the temple and ordering the Jews to sacrifice pigs to the Greek
gods Zeus and Dionysus. He also forbade circumcision and
Sabbath observance. Such oppression led to armed revolt by
the Hasmonaeans, better known as the Maccabeans, after Ju-
das Maccabaeus, who took this surname when he assumed
leadership of the rebellion. By 141 B.C., the Jewish state had
become politically independent.
    However, internal strife eventually opened the door to Ro-
man expansion. In 63 B.C. the Roman general Pompey suc-
ceeded in conquering Judah and Jerusalem, annexing them to
the Roman state. In 40 B.C. the Roman senate voted Herod
 ruler of Judah. With the arms of Roman legions, it took Herod
("Herod the Great") three years to suppress the Jews. Jesus
was born in the closing years of this despot's reign (Matt. 2:1).
Thus God would speak again to His people, not through
 prophet, priest, or ruler, but through His Son (Heb. 1:1, 2). For
a more detailed exposition, see "The Period Between the Tes-
 taments," SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, pp. 17-43.
  What is it about Christ that attracts you to Him? How can
you attract your neighbors to Him?

FURTHER STUDY: Through a study of Scripture, Ezra learned
about the First Advent and Israel's role regarding it. Review
the following scriptures concerning the Second Advent and
the part we play regarding it: Matt. 24:5-31; 28:19, 20; Rev.
14:6-12.
    Read "The Coming of a Deliverer" in Prophets and Kings,
pp. 681-702, and the last half of "The Remnant and Its Mis-
sion" in Seventh-day Adventists Believe, pp. 163-168.

   "While the angels hold the four winds, we are to work with
all our capabilities. We must bear our message without any
delay. We must give evidence to the heavenly universe, and
to men in this degenerate age, that our religion is a faith and a
power of which Christ is the Author and His word the divine
oracle. . . . There are souls ready to perish because of the
theoretical errors which are prevailing, and which are calcu-
lated to counterwork the gospel message. Who will now fully
consecrate themselves to become laborers together with God?"
—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 21.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How would you personally answer the question in the
     last sentence of the above paragraph?

     2. How did the prophecy in Isaiah 52:13-53:12 affect an
        Ethiopian official in the days of the apostles? Acts 8:26-
        39. Can you share with your Sabbath School class how
        these verses affect you?

SUMMARY: Bible prophecy gives the believer confidence
that God is in control of the affairs of this earth and is work-
ing out His plan toward a glorious triumph. Rightly under-
stood, it keeps our focus on the Saviour, our Star of hope.

      Truth Uncovered
   The Bible is basically a collection of fairy tales. At least
that was the verdict handed down by scholarly "higher
critics" toward the end of the early 1800s.
   Their allegations soon evaporated into desert air as new
archaeological discoveries validated the biblical record.
   Treasures in the Sand, by Orley Berg, unearths the hidden
treasures that amazed archaeologists then and will fascinate
readers today. If your faith in Scripture needs firming, you'll
find rock-solid evidence for your beliefs in these once-buried
treasures in the sand.
