    At a time when technology has brought the world's popu-
lations together in a "global community," the forces of sepa-
ratism, tribal warfare, ethnic rivalry, and racism seem to be
                                out of control. Sadly, the church
                                of Christ—and that includes the
                                Seventh-day Adventist Church—

                                get back to the cross, where all
                                men and women are made "one
                                in Christ Jesus" (Galatians 3:28)?
                                  The answer is Yes. The time is

                            Judges
               Deterioration and Deliverance

   The book of Judges recounts the up-and-down experience of the
Israelites during the centuries between Joshua and Samuel (about
1400-1050 B.C.). The author of the book is unknown, but the date of
writing was probably between the institution of the monarchy under
Saul and David's capture of Jerusalem from the Jebusites (Judg.
1:21; 2 Sam. 5:6-9).
    The name of the book comes from its title for the leaders after
Joshua (Judg. 2:16-19). It appears that their "judging" primarily
involved gaining justice for the Israelites by delivering them from
oppression (verse 16).
    Under Joshua, the Lord defeated powerful forces opposing the
Israelites. Following generations had the task of completing the con-
quest through faith in God's power. But their military momentum
ground to a halt and went into reverse in proportion to their disloyalty
to Him.
    Because the Israelites broke the Lord's covenant by mixing with
the inhabitants of the land and worshiping their gods, He could not
complete the fulfillment of His promises to them. He allowed the
inhabitants of the region to harass and oppress them. This is one way
the Lord sometimes punishes His unfaithful people; He withdraws
His protection so that their enemies prevail against them-. In their
misery, the Israelites would return to the Lord, whereupon He would
raise up a "judge" to deliver them. When this leader was gone, they
 would fall into worse apostasy than before. Thus, the period of the
"judges" was characterized by downward spiraling cycles of apos-
tasy, repentance, deliverance, and worse apostasy.
    While the book of Judges provides many negative examples, there
 were those, such as Deborah, Barak, and Gideon, who were faithful
 to the Lord and stood out like bright lights amid the prevailing
 darkness. Risking everything, from a human point of view, they
 placed their lives in the hands of God and were victorious against
 seemingly impossible odds. These courageous individuals, "who through
 faith conquered kingdoms, administered justice, obtained promises"
 (Heb. 11:33, NRSV), teach us that there are no limits to what we can
 accomplish for God and for His people when we trust in Him and
 allow His Spirit to move us (Judg. 3:10; 6:34; 11:29).
    The most positive message of the book of Judges is the persistence
 and patience of God's love. His people abandoned Him time after
 time, but He was always ready to receive them back. The struggles of
 God's people at that time are typical of their struggles in every era
 and especially in our era, immediately prior to the final overthrow of
 the united forces of evil.

                                                                       5

Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Judg. 1:1-2:5.

     MEMORY TEXT: "I said, I will never break my covenant with
     you" (Judges 2:1).

   KEY THOUGHT: Since God was always faithful in keeping His
covenant promises to His people, the Israelites continued to be suc-
cessful in occupying the Promised Land as long as they relied upon
Him. But as they neglected their covenant with God and disobeyed
Him, they failed to make headway against their enemies.

   DISCONNECTED AND DISSONANT. A teenage student of clas-
sical piano discovered what it means to be disconnected and dissonant.
He learned the first movement of Schumann' s Piano Concerto in A
Minor. His first performance of the work was memorable—too memo-
rable for comfort. As always, he prayed before the recital that God
would be with him. And He was. It was going well. Enjoying success,
he forgot about God and began thinking about how good a pianist he
was. Mistakes began happening, which led to insecurity, nervousness,
and finally, sheer panic. The final arpeggio consisted of wrong notes
all the way up the piano! Instead of bowing, he wanted to crawl
underneath the Steinway grand piano and hide behind the pedals.
   What went wrong? He had disconnected from God, forgetting that
success depended upon Him. For the ancient Israelites, it was far more
serious. They knew that God had covenanted to give them victory if
they trusted in Him. The scale was much larger, and the consequences
were tragic.

SUCCESS THROUGH FOLLOWING GOD (Judg. 1:1-10, 16-18,
22-26).

    The book of Judges begins with the statement that after the death of
Joshua, the Israelites asked the Lord who would lead them into battle
against the Canaanites (Judg. 1:1). Joshua was their leader during his
lifetime, just as Moses had led them earlier. But no single individual
was named as Joshua's successor.

   Whom did God intend to be Israel's leader after Joshua? Judg.
8:23.


   God had promised that the Israelites would occupy the Promised
Land completely (Exod. 23:31; Joshua 1:2-4). Now they took Him at
His word and asked Him for direction, just as they previously would
have asked direction from Joshua, who also received his orders from
God (verses 1-9). The Lord had been Israel's real leader all along, but
now the tribal leaders were directly under His command.
   It appears that the Israelites inquired of the Lord at this time by the
Urim and Thummim, precious stones in the breastplate worn by the
high priest. (See Exod. 28:30; Num. 27:21; 1 Sam. 28:6; Patriarchs
and Prophets, p. 351.) At the end of the book of Judges, the Israelites
again inquired of the Lord as to who should lead them into battle and,
again, the answer was, "Judah" (Judg. 20:18; compare 1:2). Judges
20:27, 28 makes it clear that inquiry from God at this time was
connected with the role of the high priest, who wore the Urim and
Thummim (Exod. 28:30). Even if the Urim and Thummim could only
reply "yes" or "no," answers such as "Judah" could be arrived at by a
process of elimination. (Compare Joshua 7:14-18; 1 Sam. 10:20-22.)

  Why was additional conquest necessary after the death of Joshua?
Judg. 1:21, 27-33. Had the Israelites already conquered the land?
Joshua 21:43-45.


   God had fulfilled His promise of giving the land to the Israelites.
Under Joshua, they had broken Canaanite opposition to their perma-
nent residence in Palestine. However, the tribes had not yet fully
occupied all the areas allotted to them. They needed to trust in the
leadership of their divine King and move forward courageously. When
they did so, their efforts were rewarded with success.

   Are we following God's leading in our lives? What are the
 means by which we know His will?

                                                                        7

PROMISES KEPT (Judg. 1:11-15, 20).

   Caleb motivated Israelite soldiers by offering Achsah, his daughter,
in marriage to the man who would conquer Kiriath-sepher. Othniel, a
relative of Caleb, took the town, so Caleb gave her to him and granted
her request for springs of water in addition to land in the Negeb, the
arid southern part of Palestine.

   In Judges 1, which primarily describes conquests by tribes, why
should private matters of an individual family (verses 12-15) be
significant? In other words, why is this story about Caleb and his
family here in the book of Judges?

   Which of the following answers are the most likely?
1. The story is here because it explains the conquest and distribution
   of part of the Promised Land.
2. Caleb is significant because he had been one of the 12 spies sent by
   Moses to spy out the land of Canaan (Num. 13:6). Only he and
   Joshua had faithfully brought back a good report of the land and
   encouraged the people to take it (Num. 13:30-33; 14:6-9). The
   story in Judges 1 shows that after the death of Joshua, Caleb was
   still working to take over the land.
3. Othniel is important because he later became the first judge to
   deliver Israel (Judg. 3:7-11).
4. The story illustrates the theme of faithfulness in keeping promises.
   Just as God kept His covenant promise by giving victory to His
   people when they kept their promise to serve and follow Him,
   Caleb kept a promise to his fellow Israelites by giving Achsah to
   Othniel. The theme of keeping promises is further illustrated in
   Judges 1:20, which states that Caleb received Hebron as Moses had
   said (Deut. 1:36; compare Joshua 14:9-14). Judges 1:24, 25 de-
   scribes how the Israelites kept their promise to deal kindly with a
   man who showed them the way into the city of Luz.
5. The story describes good and honorable treatment of a woman, in
   contrast to later episodes in the book of Judges. (Compare Judg.
   11:34-40; 16:1, 4; 19:22-30.)
6. Another answer:

7. All the above.

   Do we keep our promises? (See Num. 30:2; Eccl. 5:4, 5.) Do we
trust others to keep theirs? Do we pray as though we believe that
God is willing to give good things to us, His children (Luke 11:9-
13), just as Caleb was willing to give good gifts to his daughter?

FAILURE TO KEEP PROMISES (Judg. 1:19, 21, 27-36).

   Judges 1:19, summarizing the conquests of the tribe of Judah,
introduces a disturbing note: Although God was with Judah so that it
succeeded in taking possession of the hill country, it failed to take the
plain, where chariots of iron gave the Canaanites an advantage. Verse
21 gives a similar notice regarding the tribe of Benjamin: It could not
drive out the Jebusites. While the northern tribes had some success
(verses 22-26), they had a lot of failure, too (verses 27-36). The tribe
of Dan had a particularly rough time (verse 34), to the extent that it
later had to relocate (Joshua 19:40-48; Judges 18).

  Why did the Israelites fail to drive out all the Canaanites?
Judg. 1:19, 21, 27-36. What went wrong?


    Judges 1:19 refers to chariots of iron as the reason for Judah's
failure. But this was only a superficial reason. Deborah and Barak later
led the Israelites to victory against an army that had 900 chariots of
iron (Judges 4), showing that when the Israelites offered themselves
willingly and wholeheartedly to God's service (Judg. 5:2, 9), nothing
could stand in their way! The deeper reason for Judah's failure must
have been a limited supply of commitment: They trusted God to give
them victory as long as the enemy was not too intimidating and as long
as the task did not require too much sacrifice.
    Caleb was exceptional, as he had been years before when he spied
out the land (Numbers 13, 14). Because he wholly followed the Lord
(Num. 32:12), not even the sons of Anak, who were giants, could
intimidate him. He asked for the territory of the giants so that he could
drive them out of Hebron (Joshua 14:11-15; Judg. 1:20), thereby
showing that the 10 unfaithful spies had been wrong in regarding them
as an insurmountable obstacle.
    The northern tribes failed not only because of the power of the
Canaanites; in some cases, the Israelites were strong enough to drive
them out but chose to benefit from their forced labor instead (Judg.
1:28, 30, 33, 35). These Israelites lacked sufficient commitment to
cooperate with God so that His promise regarding the land could be
 fulfilled; they actually disregarded His promise and allowed Canaanites
 to dwell among them.

     In our daily, individual battles with evil, are there "chariots
 of iron" or "giants" that intimidate us? How can we increase our
 commitment and courage? Mark 9:14-29.



                                                                       9

PROMISES BROKEN (Judg. 2:1,2).

   The Israelites failed to occupy all the Promised Land. They lacked
commitment and attempted to profit from Canaanite labor. In Judges
2:1, 2, the Angel of the Lord states a more serious reason. Although
God had kept His covenant promise to give the land to the Israelites,
they had not kept their part, which involved their making no covenant
with the Canaanites and their breaking down the heathen altars. (See
Exod. 23:23-33.) The Israelites had been commissioned to drive out
and destroy all the Canaanites, without pity (Deut. 7:16).

  Why did God call for such harsh treatment of the Canaanites?
See, for example, Gen. 15:16; Exod. 23:33.


   Which of the following best answers the above question?
1. The Israelites could not have covenants with God and with the
   Canaanites at the same time. Tolerance of Canaanite worship of
   other gods defiled God's sanctuary and profaned His holy name
   (Lev. 20:3). This was disloyalty to God and a breach of His cov-
   enant.
2. The Canaanites had progressively rejected God, who had been
   revealed to them by His created works, as well as by people such as
   Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Melchizedek. Romans 1:20-32 de-
   scribes what happens to people when they turn away from God.
   This is an apt description of what we know about the Canaanites
   from the Bible (see, for example, Leviticus 18, 20) and from ar-
   chaeological evidence. They emulated the immorality of their gods.
   They worshiped the creature rather than the Creator, engaged in
   sexual immorality, including homosexuality, and practiced all kinds
   of other sin. By the time of Joshua, the iniquity of the Canaanites
   was complete. (See Gen. 15:16.) Their probation had closed, and
   they deserved to die (see Rom. 1:32), just as surely as did the
   inhabitants of Sodom or the people who lived at the time of the
   Flood. God's sentence on the Canaanites was just. (See Judg. 1:7.)
3. The Israelites could not handle having idolatry in their midst, be-
   cause they were likely to be attracted to it and to serve other gods
   themselves (Exod. 23:33).
4. Another answer:

5. All the above.

   Are the covenants/partnerships that we make acceptable to
God? (See Amos 3:3.) What is their influence upon us? (See
2 Cor. 6:14-7:1.)

LOST OPPORTUNITY (Judg. 2:3-5).

   Having indicted the Israelites for failing to keep God's covenant,
the Angel of the Lord pronounced their punishment: God would not
fulfill His promise to drive the Canaanites out before them. (Compare
Exod. 23:28.) The Canaanites would remain to cause them trouble,
and the gods of the Canaanites would be snares to them. (See Num.
33:55.)

   Since God did not want the Israelites to fall into false worship,
why did He punish them by allowing the gods of the Canaanites to
be snares to them? Judg. 2:3.


   Having the Canaanites and their gods in their midst was the punish-
ment for the Israelites, but it was also the natural result of the course
that they had chosen. God was simply saying: "You refused to listen to
Me when I warned you about the dangers of allowing the Canaanites to
stay, so now you're going to have to learn the hard way."
   In life, time is of the essence. An opportunity does not last forever,
whether it is a clearance sale on clothes, an unusually low home
mortgage rate, a friendship that could blossom into a marriage, a call
to accept Christ, or something else. When the Israelites under Joshua
entered the land and broke the main Canaanite resistance, the remain-
ing pockets of Canaanite resistance were at their weakest. If they had
kept up their momentum, they could have finished the job. But the
Israelites lost their opportunity because, as time went by, they let their
power deteriorate as the Canaanites recovered theirs.

  Why should we now take full advantage of the opportunities
God is giving us? Eccl. 9:10; Matt. 24:14.


   God has called us, not to conquer human beings, but through fel-
lowship with Christ to overcome the power of Satan in our lives (Eph.
6:10-18). We are to tell the world the good news of salvation through
Jesus (Matt. 28:18-20). Time is of the essence. Today's decisions
influence later decisions. Victories won make future victories easier.
Cherished sins grow stronger. Conversations in which Christ can be
introduced come to an end. Minds and countries open and close to the
gospel message.

    What kind of personal and corporate trouble do we avoid b
 following God's instructions?

FURTHER STUDY: The early failure of the Israelites resulted in
long-lasting difficulties: Ps. 106:34-43.
   Read Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, "The Earlier Judges,"
pp. 543, 544.

   "It is not safe for Christians to choose the society of those who have
no connection with God, and whose course is displeasing to Him. Yet
how many professed Christians venture upon the forbidden ground.
Many invite to their homes relatives who are vain, trifling, and un-
godly; and often the example and influence of these irreligious visitors
produce lasting impressions upon the minds of the children in the
household. The influence thus exerted is similar to that which resulted
from the association of the Hebrews with the godless Canaanites.
   "God holds the parents accountable for disregarding His command
to separate themselves and their families from these unholy influences.
While we must live in the world, we are not to be of the world. We are
forbidden to conform to its practices and fashions. The friendship of
the ungodly is more dangerous than their enmity."—Ellen G. White
Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2, p. 1001.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How can we shield ourselves and our children from evil
     influences and at the same time be a good influence on
     others? If we are to spread the gospel to those who are
     perishing, what kind of contact should we have with them?

   2. Both the period of the judges and the period of the kings
      began with high hopes and covenant promises, but both
      deteriorated into faithlessness and idolatry. Can you find
      other parallels between the two periods? Why did history
      repeat itself in this way?

   3. Have some characteristics of the period of the judges been
      repeated in the Christian Era? Are some of these still present
      in our time and in our lives? (See Revelation 2, 3.) If so,
      what should we do?

SUMMARY: The success and well-being of the Israelites depended
upon the health of their covenant relationship with God. He was eager
to bless them in every way, but they neglected to cooperate with Him
and chose to disregard His promises. He offers a covenant to us, as
well, and our ultimate success depends upon the way we treat it.

       Eig7                     James H. Zachary

          One day, while working in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Atres Sreja
       purchased a book from a literature evangelist. Through that book
       he found Jesus as his Saviour.
           As he studied his Bible, he was challenged by Ezekiel 3:18:
       "When I say to a wicked man, You will surely die, and you do not
       warn him or speak out to dissuade him from his evil ways in order
       to save his life, that wicked man will die for his sin, and I will hold
       you accountable for his blood" (NIV). Sreja thought of the people
       in his village. He realized that he must warn them of Jesus' soon
       return or be responsible for their blood. He resigned his position at
       the Addis Ababa Adventist hospital, sold his bed, and set out for
       his home village.
           Members of his tribe, the Guragie people, practiced a fanatical
       mixture of Christianity and spiritualism. They opposed Atres'
       efforts to witness for the Lord. They even cast him into prison.
           One day as he was leaving his mother's home, where he was
       staying, a voice commanded him, "Burn it." He was puzzled. Burn
       what? That evening as he entered his mother's yard, he saw the
       spirit tree. "That's it! I must burn that tree."
           He set the tree on fire. A draft pulled the flames through the
       hollow trunk, and in moments the tree was a flaming torch. Villag-
       ers saw the flames and rushed to see what was happening. When
       they realized their sacred tree was burning, they knew Atres had
       burned it. The angry mob tried to set fire to his home and kill
       Atres. But his brother stepped forward, saying, "Leave him alone.
       If he has done wrong, the spirits will take his life."
           The mob pulled back and watched as the fire they had set went
        out. Sparks from the burning spirit tree that fell on the grass roof
        of his house also smoldered and went out. Even the dry grass
        around the base of the tree did not burn. The God of Atres was
                                  stronger than the spirit gods! The crowd
                                  stayed by the remains of their destroyed
                                  spirit tree all night. But they knew that
                                  Atres' God was the true God.
                                                                 (Continued)

                Ups and Downs




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Judg. 2:6-3:6.

   MEMORY TEXT: "Nevertheless the Lord raised up judges,
   which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled
   them. And yet they would not hearken unto their judges" (Judges
   2:16, 17).

   KEY THOUGHT: During the period of the "judges," God's people
fell into a repeated pattern of apostasy, suffering at the hands of their
enemies, deliverance through a "judge" sent by their merciful Lord,
followed by worse apostasy.

    ROLLER-COASTER RELIGION. (Some countries do not have
roller coasters. A roller coaster is a miniature train with open cars. It
runs up and down huge man-made hills on rail tracks. In some coun-
tries they are common in many recreation parks.)
    The beginning of a roller-coaster ride isn't bad. There's a gentle
clickety-clack as the mechanism pulls you smoothly up. The view
becomes better. Soon you can see the whole park, and then the whole
surrounding countryside. You can see just about everything—every-
thing, that is, except the track. Where's the track? Oh no! There it
is . . . wayyyyy down there! Before you can decide whether to have a
cardiac arrest or to sink into a deep coma, down you go. You won't
remember any thoughts after that, because there aren't any; just a
long, horrifying feeling as you go down, up, down, up, down.
     "Roller-coaster religion" has a lot of ups and downs, but it always
ends on the down side. A roller-coaster ride takes only a few minutes,
but "roller-coaster religion" lasts a lot longer. The Israelites had a
chronic case of it for hundreds of years. (See Judg. 2:6-23.)

THE FAITHFUL GENERATION (Judg. 2:6-9).

   The book of Judges begins with the words "after the death of
Joshua" (Judg. 1:1), but Judges 2:6 goes back to the time when Joshua
was still alive.

  Why isn't the information given in Judges 2:6-9 placed at the
beginning of the book, according to the order in which events
happened?


   Since the book of Judges is about the time after Joshua's death, it is
appropriate for it to begin where it does. The account of military
events in chapter 1 leads up to the pronouncement of the Angel of the
Lord in Judges 2:1-5, which may be regarded as the overall theme of
the book: By breaking God's covenant, the Israelites forfeited com-
plete fulfillment of the covenant promises. They were in the Land of
Promise but often ignored God's covenant terms. Judges 2:6-3:6
provides additional background to the pronouncement of the Angel of
the Lord and shows how these words were subsequently fulfilled.
Before describing the faithlessness of the generations after Joshua
(2:10-3:6), it is fitting to mention Joshua and the faithful who entered
Canaan with him (2:6-9).

  Why was the generation of Joshua faithful? Judg. 2:7; compare
verse 10.


   Those who entered Canaan with Joshua saw special miracles wrought
by the Lord, such as the parting of the Jordan River (Joshua 3:14-17)
and the fall of Jericho's walls (Joshua 6:20). But of those who entered
the Promised Land, only Caleb and Joshua belonged to the older
generation who had witnessed the plagues of Egypt (Exodus 7-12),
the crossing of the Red Sea (Exodus 14), and the giving of the Law on
Mt. Sinai (Exodus 19, 20). Most of the older generation had died in the
wilderness (Num. 26:63-65). Those who entered the land were faith-
ful, not simply because they saw what the Lord did for them, but
because they chose to trust Him wholly. (See Joshua 14:8, 9, 14.)
   The same motivation applies to us. We follow Jesus because of
what He did for us (Phil. 2:5-8). If we, like Israel, forget the provisions
of the new covenant and the gift of victory in Jesus, God cannot
provide us with the complete blessing He wishes to give.

    Have you seen God work for you? How did this experience
 affect you?

                                                                       15

THE UNFAITHFUL GENERATION (Judg. 2:10-13).

   In Judges 2:10, the words "another generation grew up after them,
who did not know the Lord" (NRSV) remind us of Exodus 1:8: "Now a
new king arose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph" (NRSV). God
had delivered the Israelites from Pharaoh, and now they had become
like their old master! Just as Pharaoh recognized no need for loyalty to
the family of Joseph, so the Israelites after Joshua saw no need for
loyalty to God. We can hear them saying with Pharaoh: "Who is the
Lord, that I should obey him?" (Exod. 5:2; NIV). Ignorance is often
the basis for foolish behavior.

   Why didn't the new generation of Israelites, who were enjoying
the Promised Land, recognize God, who had given them the land?
Deut. 6:10-12.


   When the Israelites were comfortable in the land and occupied with
their material well-being, they took their blessings for granted and
forgot about God, turning to the gods of the Canaanites (Judg. 2:11-
13), the snare of which the Angel of the Lord had spoken (verse 3).
   Forgetting has various meanings and consequences, depending upon
the situation. It may be a small matter, involving minor inconvenience,
or it may be disastrous. Where relationships are concerned, forgetting
can be a symptom of lack of concern for someone. That is what a wife
fears when her husband forgets their anniversary. Is he beginning to
forget about her?
   Forgetting God shows lack of concern for Him, in spite of the fact
that He is the Creator and Redeemer. There is evidence of His power
and love all around (Ps. 19:1-10), so there is no excuse for forgetting
Him (Rom. 1:20). Forgetting God is not simply an involuntary memory
lapse of no consequence; it shows a break in the divine-human cov-
enant relationship. In fact, God commands His people to remember
Him on His Sabbath day once a week (Exod. 20:8-11), so forgetting
Him is in itself an act of disobedience!

   What provisions had God made to prevent the people from
forgetting about Him? Deut. 4:9, 10; 6:4-9. Why did God's plan to
carry faithfulness from one generation to another fail?


   What are we doing to educate our children to follow God?
What are we teaching them by our example? (See Deut. 6:4-9;
Joshua 4:20-24.) What negative influences must we counteract to
ensure that they will constantly be encouraged to serve the Lord?

FROM DISOBEDIENCE TO DISTRESS (Judg. 2:14, 15).

   When the Israelites forsook the Lord and worshiped the gods of the
Canaanites, they not only could not drive the Canaanites out of the
land; the balance of power shifted in favor of the Canaanites and other
enemies, who plundered and oppressed the Israelites.
   At the beginning of the book of Judges, the Lord gave the enemies
of the Israelites into their hands (Judg. 1:4). Now "the hand of the Lord
was against them to bring misfortune, as the Lord had warned them
and sworn to them" (Judg. 2:15, NRSV). Before the Israelites had
entered the land, God had promised blessings for obedience and warned
of punishments for disobedience. Among the blessings was military
success (Lev. 26:6-8), and among the punishments was the withdrawal
of God's support of their attempts to subdue their enemies (Lev.
26:16, 17).

   Why were the Israelites miserable when they disobeyed God? If
they didn't want to serve Him, why didn't He respect their choice
and just leave them alone? Heb. 12:5-11.


   Which of the following provides the best answer?
1. When the Israelites sinned, God was completely just in punishing
   them.
2. God wanted them to see the connection between blessing and
   obedience.
3. God's punishment involved withholding His protection, which was
   conditional upon obedience. Without Him, the Israelites suffered
   the consequences of their choices.
4. The Israelites belonged to God in a special way because of His
   covenant with them at Sinai (Exod. 24:3-8) and His earlier cov-
   enant with their ancestor, Abraham (Genesis 15, 17). His discipline
   demonstrated that He loved them as His children (Heb. 12:5-11).
5. God did not immediately take "no" for an answer, because He knew
   that they did not understand the full implications of what they were
   doing. He respected their freedom of choice but gave them an
   opportunity to taste the consequences of their decisions so they
   could choose more wisely in the future.
6. Another answer:

7. All the above.

   How do you react to what you think might be discipline from
 God? Do you accept it as given in love for your own good, or do
 you become angry with God?

                                                                      17

NOT LEARNING FROM MISTAKES (Judg. 2:16-19).

   Why did the Lord raise up judges to save the Israelites from
their distress (Judg. 2:16)? Judg. 2:18; 3:9, 15.


   Discipline does not go on forever, or it becomes destruction. Disci-
pline is not merely punishment; discipline is designed to redeem and
transform. God wanted to rehabilitate His people, not to destroy them.
So when they realized the folly of what they had done, He sent
deliverers. But their repentance did not last. Like the proverbial dog
(Prov. 26:11), they repeated their foolishness by turning to other gods
(Judg. 2:17, 19).
   Before the Israelites entered the land, God promised that while they
followed Him, they would be upwardly mobile—as we may be if we
allow Christ to rule in our hearts (2 Cor. 3:18). They would excel and
be the head rather than the tail (Deut. 28:13, 14). This implies that
disobedience would result in going down and being the tail. The
Israelites went up and down through cycle after cycle of faithfulness
and disobedience, with each period of disobedience taking them lower
than the preceding one (Judg. 2:19). This was "roller-coaster religion."

  Why didn't the Israelites learn from their mistakes? Judg. 2:19.
How could the downward trend have been stopped? Jude 24.


   When Peter was walking on water, he became distracted by his
surroundings and lost his focus upon Christ. Beginning to sink, "he
cried out, 'Lord, save me!' Jesus immediately reached out His hand
and caught him, saying to him, 'You of little faith, why did you
doubt?' " (Matt. 14:30, 31, NRSV). Peter was aware when he began to
sink. Maintaining a connection with upward power is the key to pre-
venting a spiritual downturn. Jesus made it clear to Peter that faith in
Him was that connection (Matt. 14:31).
   God lovingly picks us up and forgives us when we fall (Micah 7:8,
19; 1 John 1:9), but His ideal for us is to prevent us from falling (Jude
24; compare 1 John 2:1). If we do begin to go down, the sooner we are
aware of our condition, the better. Once downward momentum de-
velops, it is hard to stop it.

     Are you having an up-and-down religious experience in your
 life? What causes you to slip? (See 2 Cor. 13:5.) What can you do
 to maintain a constant pattern of spiritual growth? What is the
 relationship between your efforts and Christ's power in the
 process of overcoming?

FAILING GOD'S TEST (Judg. 2:20-3:6).

   As announced by the Angel of the Lord, because of the disobedi-
ence of the Israelites, God did not give them the ability to drive out the
Canaanites who were left (Judg. 2:3).

  Why hadn't God given the faithful Israelites under Joshua the
ability to drive out all the Canaanites at once? Exod. 23:29, 30.


   The remaining Canaanites became a means by which God could test
the faithfulness of the Israelites (Judg. 2:22; 3:4). Total dependence
upon the Lord in conflict with the wicked Canaanites was an important
part of the test (Judg. 3:1, 2). Would the Israelites trust in God to
overcome their enemies, or would they seek to avoid conflict by
making covenants with them?
   The Israelites failed the test (Judg. 3:5, 6). They intermarried with
the Canaanites, against God's specific command (Deut. 7:3), and
worshiped their gods. Thus, the Israelites became like the evil people
whom they were supposed to dispossess and like the pharaoh who had
not recognized the Lord (Exod. 5:1, 2). Later, the degradation of some
Israelites reached the point at which they became like the people of
Sodom (Judg. 19:22-25; compare Gen. 19:4-11), whom God destroyed
by fire (Gen. 19:24, 25).

  Why had God forbidden intermarriage with the Canaanites?
Exod. 34:15, 16. How does this apply to us? See 2 Cor. 6:14-18.


   Jesus said: "You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its
saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for
anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men" (Matt. 5:13,
NIV). Salt is valuable for its flavor enhancement and as a preservative.
When it comes in contact with food, it is a positive influence because it
improves the flavor of that with which it is mixed. If it loses that
characteristic, it is worthless. Just so, God's people make a contribu-
tion when they are spiritually distinct and influential—in the world but
not of the world (John 15:19). When they assimilate worldly ways and
attitudes, they have nothing to offer.

    How can we maintain our distinctness and influence as Chris-
 tians, rather than being absorbed into the environment of unbe-
 lievers? Should we withdraw from the company of unbelievers?
 How can we be part of our society, yet spiritually apart?


                                                                       19

FURTHER STUDY: To illustrate the lesson, study in Scripture the
up-and-down experience of the following people: Solomon, Peter,
Judas, Mary Magdalene.
  On the beginning of the period of the judges, read Ellen G. White,
Patriarchs and Prophets, "The Earlier Judges" (chapter 53), p. 545.
On depending upon Christ, read Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages,
"A Night on the Lake," pp. 381, 382.

   "At the present day, as in ancient times, the people of God plead
their own ease or convenience as an excuse for neglecting divine
service. They will devise means to preserve the Christian name with-
out making any sacrifice of time or means. God requires his people to
maintain his worship. And those who are burdened with care and
responsibility, should be the last to excuse themselves from religious
privileges. They need wisdom from above. They need to be constantly
reaching upward to lay hold on the divine arm, lest they stumble and
fall. They can walk safely, only as they fear God, and obey his voice."
—Ellen G. White, Signs of the Times, July 28, 1881.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Review Judges 1:19-3:6, and list as many explanations as
     you can for the failure of the Israelites. Then answer the
     following questions: Are there connections between these
     explanations? Which appear to be the most important? Which
     are surface factors, and which are underlying causes? How
     could each of these factors have been prevented?

   2. Review your own life, and list reasons for your successes
      and your failures. Then answer the four questions given
      above under 1. With regard to the last question, consider
      especially the role of your daily devotional life. How could
      your personal Bible study and prayer be a more influential
      part of your life?

   3. How can we tactfully help others in our religious communi-
      ties to progress upward spiritually?

SUMMARY: The Israelites had an up-and-down experience because
they failed to maintain a steady relationship with God, to learn from
their mistakes, and to learn from God's leading in the past. In spite of
their failures, God mercifully delivered them from the distresses that
they had brought upon themselves. We can learn from their story and
have a steady experience by maintaining our faith connection with
Christ each day.

                           The Spirit Tree, Part 2
                                James H. Zachary

           Aires was not welcomed home to his village in Ethiopia when he
        returned to preach the gospel. But after the miracle at the burning
        spirit tree, people in his village knew Atres' God was more powerful
        than their own. He began preaching with new courage. His mother
        was his first convert, and soon his brothers followed.
           Although Atres has only a sixth-grade education, the Holy
        Spirit has used his willingness to witness among his people of the
        soon-coming Jesus. Recently a large baptism was celebrated among
        the Guragie tribe. Most of the baptismal candidates are Atres'
        converts. They lovingly call him Pastor Large.
           Today Atres serves as an ordained pastor. God continues to do
        great things through him. Pastor Large has planted 19 churches
        and companies, and built three elementary schools and a clinic.
        Currently he is working on developing a secondary school to
        serve the needs of 24 villages of his tribe.
           God is blessing Pastor Large, and he is respected for his work,
        even by Christians of other faiths. Because of his outstanding
        communicty leadership he was asked to chair the Catholic Relief
        Agency one year. Working with that program, he supervises the
        feeding of 3,000 malnourished children. He has built roads for his
        people and has improved many aspects of the community life.
        The Ethiopian government regularly takes foreign guests to see
        his development projects.
            During recent evangelistic meetings held in Addis Ababa, the

                      Deliverers




Sabbath Afternoon

READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Judg. 3:7-31; 10:1-5; 12:8-
15.

  MEMORY TEXT: "And when the children of Israel cried unto
  the Lord, the Lord raised up a deliverer to the children of
  Israel. .. . And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him" (Judges
  3:9, 10).

   KEY THOUGHT: The "judges" were deliverers, impelled and
empowered by the Spirit of God. These individuals gained justice for
the Israelites by defeating their enemies, who were oppressing them.

    HELP FOR THE HELPLESS: Little Johnny runs to his mother,
complaining that big Bobby is picking on him. Mother investigates
and discovers that the accusation is true. She sends Bobby to his room
for a while to help him remember how to treat Johnny in the future.
    A woman is harassed by an employer, who ignores her pleas to
leave her alone. In desperation, she seeks and obtains a legal injunc-
tion to protect her.
    A small country, attacked by a larger one, requests protection from
United Nations peacekeeping forces. The request is granted, and the
aggression is repelled.
    In each of these cases, the stronger oppresses the weaker until the
latter obtains help from a higher power. Such a power acts according
to standards of fairness, which can be called "law," and enforces these
standards.
    When the Israelites disobeyed God, He allowed them to be op-
pressed by their enemies. But when they repented and cried to Him for
help, He delivered them from oppression and gave them justice.

OTHNIEL (Judg. 3:7-11).

   In summarizing the history of God's dealings with the Israelites
after the death of Joshua, Judges 2:14 speaks of the Lord's giving them
over to plunderers when they turned from Him. The first of these
oppressors mentioned in the book of Judges is Cushan-rishathaim,
king of Aram of the Two Rivers (Judg. 3:8), the land to the northeast
of Palestine, which we call Mesopotamia (from the Greek meaning
"between rivers," namely, the Tigris and the Euphrates).
   The name of this king as it is given in the Hebrew text means
"Cushan of two wickednesses." The latter part of the name, which
seems to play on the fact that the king was from Aram of the Two
Rivers, "was probably added by the Israelites to show their aversion
for him."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2, p. 324.
   The Bible does not say whether Cushan-rishathaim was allied with
the Canaanites or whether he oppressed them, as well as the Israelites.
The important thing is that the Lord "sold" the Israelites into his power
because they turned to other gods (Judg. 3:7, 8).

   What does Judges 3:8 mean by saying that the Lord "sold" the
Israelites? Compare Judg. 2:14; Deut. 32:30.


   God had ransomed, or redeemed, the Israelites from slavery to
Pharaoh (Deut. 7:8; compare Micah 6:4). They no longer belonged to
Pharaoh but to Him. But when they ungratefully rejected the Lord, He
temporarily allowed them to be oppressed by another cruel master.
   After eight years of oppression, the Israelites finally got around to
turning in the right direction for help (Judg. 3:7, 9). When they re-
turned to the Lord, He delivered them under the leadership of the first
of the "judges": "Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother"
(verse 9).
   Depending upon whether the words "Caleb's younger brother" de-
scribe Othniel or Kenaz, Othniel was either Caleb's younger half
brother (or full brother if Jephunneh, the father of Caleb, is another
name for Kenaz; compare Num. 13:6; 14:6, 30) or Caleb's nephew. In
any case, Othniel was also related to Caleb by marriage, having won
his daughter by taking Kiriath-sepher (Judg. 1:12, 13). It is significant
that Othniel was closely related to Caleb. Like Caleb, he was a coura-
geous hero who won victories for the Israelites because he wholeheart-
edly followed the Lord.

   Have you personally experienced deliverance by God from
 another master? (See John 12:31; 1 Cor. 7:23; Titus 3:3-7.)


                                                                      23

JUDGES MEANS "DELIVERERS" (Judg. 3:9).

    When we think of a "judge," we think of a person who sits in a
courthouse and makes decisions on legal cases. Closest to this idea in
the book of Judges is Deborah, a prophetess (Judg. 4:4, 5).
    Aside from Deborah, the "judges" in the book of Judges may have
engaged in some judicial activity, but they were primarily known as
military leaders who delivered the Israelites from their enemies (Judg.
2:16). Thus, Judges 3:9, 10 refers to Othniel as "a deliverer [saviour]
to the children of Israel, who delivered [saved] them." In these verses,
judge means "deliverer."

   In the book of Judges, why are deliverers referred to as "judges"?
Ps. 82:3.


   Which of the following best answers the above question?
1. The Hebrew word that is translated "judge" has a broader meaning
   than the English word. It can refer to a deliverer, as well as to a
   person who decides legal cases.
2. "Judging," that is, "making decisions," was an important function
   of a political organizer such as a king (1 Kings 3:9; compare 2 Sam.
   15:2-4). Thus, before the Israelites had kings (Judg. 17:6), they
   referred to their organizers and decision makers as "judges."
   Understood in this way, Judges 3:10 can mean: The Spirit of the
   Lord came upon Othniel, so that he assumed leadership of Israel as
   its organizer, following which he went to war and defeated the
   enemy.
3. A "judge" in a court of law has the power to make a decision that
   vindicates an oppressed person, thereby freeing him or her from an
   oppressor (Ps. 82:3; Prov. 29:14). Likewise, when the Israelites
   returned to God, the protection of His covenant then went into
   effect again. Their enemies were no longer instruments of God's
   justice but, rather, unjust oppressors. Then "judges" acted for God
   in carrying out His sentences of judgment (compare Deut. 17:11)
   upon the enemies of the Israelites, freeing His people from oppres-
   sion.
4. Another answer:

5. All the above.

   What are the advantages of having God as your judge? Ps.
7:8; 26:1; Dan. 7:22.

IMPELLED BY THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD (Judg. 3:10).

   Othniel did not appoint himself as Israel's judge-deliverer; the
Lord raised him up (Judg. 3:9). "The spirit of the Lord came upon him,
and he judged Israel" (verse 10, NRSV). Likewise, the other "judges"
were raised up by the Lord (Judg. 2:16; compare 3:15). In the cases of
several of these people, the book of Judges states explicitly that the
Spirit of the Lord played a major role in raising them up for special
work. The Spirit of the Lord "took possession of Gideon" (Judg. 6:34,
NRSV), "came upon Jephthah" (Judg. 11:29, NRSV), "began to stir"
Samson (Judg. 13:25, NRSV), and "rushed on" Samson (Judg. 14:6,
19; 15:14, NRSV). These expressions give the impression that in
various ways God's Spirit took control of certain individuals at crucial
times, motivating and empowering them to do things that they other-
wise would not or could not do.

  What occurred in other instances when the Spirit of the Lord
came upon believers? See 1 Sam. 11:6; 16:13; Acts 2:1-4.


   The Spirit of the Lord (Holy Spirit) came upon people earlier,
during the wilderness wandering of the Israelites (Num. 11:25-29),
and later, in the time of the first kings of Israel (see the verses in
1 Samuel given above). In the book of Judges, activity motivated by
the Holy Spirit's control was primarily military in nature. (Compare
1 Sam. 11:6-11.)

   It is clear why God's Spirit would control a person in a military
situation: to deliver God's people. Why was the Spirit poured
upon people in other situations? Num. 11:25-29; Acts 2:1-4.


   The Holy Spirit inspires and empowers special communication
between God and human beings. The fact that there is a supernatural
element involved means that people are likely to pay attention and gain
the benefit of God's communication. Because such manifestations can
be so influential, it is vital to test them "to see whether they are from
God" (1 John 4:1, NRSV).

    Are you willing for God's Spirit to control you? (See Joel
2:28, 29.) To which actions of the Spirit should we continually
 yield control? Gal. 5:22-25; John 16:13.




                                                                     25

RETRIBUTION FOR AFFLICTING GOD'S PEOPLE (Judg. 3:12-
30).

   Again, the Israelites turned from the Lord, who this time gave them
into the power of Eglon, king of Moab, who defeated Israel with the
help of the Ammonites and the Amalekites (Judg. 3:12, 13). After 18
years of serving Eglon, the Israelites concluded that they would rather
serve the Lord, so they cried to Him, and He raised up Ehud to deliver
them (verses 14, 15).
   Whereas Othniel had been from Judah, the largest tribe, Ehud's
leadership ability was handicapped by the fact that he was from Ben-
jamin, the smallest tribe. Moreover, his right hand was "restricted"
(verse 15, Hebrew), meaning that he was left-handed.

  Why does God at times choose as leaders people who seem
unfitted? 1 Sam. 16:7; 1 Cor. 1:25-31.


    Ehud's physical difference was an important factor in his success!
In order to deliver Israel, he first needed to assassinate the leader of
the oppressing power, Eglon. To kill Eglon, he had to be within
striking distance with a weapon. He could come close by taking him
tribute on behalf of the Israelites and then saying that he had a secret
message from God (Judg. 3:15, 17-20). But how could he pass the
Moabite guards with a weapon? Because he was left-handed, Ehud
carried a concealed dagger on the right side (verse 16) rather than the
usual left side. So the guards did not detect the weapon.

   Ehud's assassination of Eglon is recounted in particularly gory
detail (Judg. 3:21, 22). Why?


   The Israelites deplored the cruelty of their oppressors. This ex-
plains why the king defeated by Othniel is called in Hebrew: Cushan-
rishathaim, which means "Cushan of two wickednesses" (Judg. 3:8;
see Sunday's lesson). Compare treatment of Haman in the book of
Esther. Eglon's body resembled his character: repulsive. His name
means "calf." As one who had filled up the cup of his iniquity, he was
subject to the judgment of God.

   Why was such retribution meted out by a servant of God
appropriate in that setting but very wrong in our setting? (See
Matt. 5:43-48; Luke 23:34.) What differences do you see be-
tween Israel under a theocracy and the social and political situa-
tions in which we find ourselves today?

GOADING ON TO VICTORY (Judg. 3:31; 10:1-5; 12:8-15).

   After Ehud, Shamgar delivered Israel by killing 600 Philistines
with an ox-goad (Judg. 3:31; compare 5:6). We are told in these verses
that Shamgar was the son of Anath, but that is all we know about him.
The book of Judges mentions five additional "minor" judges: Tola,
Jair, Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon. We are told nothing more than where
they were from, some information about their families, and how long
they judged Israel.

   Why are the "minor" judges (Judg. 3:31; 10:1-5; 12:8-15) men-
tioned in the book of Judges at all?


   Which of the following best answers the question?
1. The author wanted to present a complete list of deliverers.
2. The author wanted to acknowledge the contributions of people of
   various tribes and parts of the country.
3. Counting the minor judges, there are 12 judgeships mentioned in
   the book of Judges, just as there were 12 tribes of Israel: Othniel,
   Ehud, Shamgar, Deborah and Barak together, Gideon, Tola, Jair,
   Jephthah, Ibzan, Elon, Abdon, and Samson.
4. The brief notices about the minor judges (names in italics below)
   contribute to the book's structure:
      I. Introduction to the Period of the "Judges" (Judg. 1:1-3:6).
          A. Historical preface (1:1-2:5).
          B. Summary with interpretation (2:6-3:6).
     11. Accounts of the "Judges" (3:7-16:31).
          A. Othniel (3:7-11).
          B. Ehud (3:12-30).
          C. Shamgar (3:31).

6. All the above.

FURTHER STUDY: Study the structure of the book of Judges (see
outline in Thursday's lesson) in relation to its content. Consider the
possible significance of structural features—such as the increase of
minor judges toward the end of the book—for the book's meaning.
   Note the double beginning of the book and its double ending. The
historical preface at the beginning of the book (Judg. 1:1-2:5) is tied
to the end of the book, which deals with the war with Benjamin (19:1-
21:25). In both sections, military coordination between the tribes is
governed by the Lord's instruction that the tribe of Judah should lead
the way (1:1, 2; 20:18). Furthermore, the second and second-last
sections of the book (2:6-3:6; 17:1-18:31) both emphasize idolatry.
Thus, the outer framework of the book is unified by a pattern of
inversion that can be called "chiastic," after the Greek letter chi, which
looks like an X:

   Judah first (1:1-2:5)             Idolatry (2:6-3:6).
                             X
   Idolatry (17:1-18:31)             Judah first (19:1-21:25).

   In addition to unity, this pattern emphasizes tragic, ironic shifts that
occurred during the period of the "judges." At the beginning of the
book, Judah leads the battle against Canaanites, and the Israelites
become ensnared by Canaanite gods. At the end of the book, Israelites
make gods of their own, and Judah leads the battle against fellow
Israelites. So the Israelites become their own enemies.
   On the background, theme, and structure of the book of Judges,
read the SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2, pp. 301-306.
   "When Othniel was designated as the man whom God had chosen to
lead and deliver Israel, he did not refuse to take the responsibility. In
the strength of God he at once commenced to repress idolatry as the
Lord had commanded, to administer justice, and to elevate the stand-
ard of morality and religion. As Israel repented of their sins, the Lord
manifested His great mercy toward them, and wrought for their deliv-
erance."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2,
p. 1002.

   DISCUSSION QUESTION: What parallels do you see between
     the way God delivered Israel and the way Jesus delivers us?
     What similarities and differences are there between the
     "judges" and the spiritual leaders of our church?

SUMMARY: Through the leadership of "judges" such as Othniel,
Ehud, and Shamgar, the Lord won justice and deliverance for His
people. These leaders were designated, motivated, and empowered by
the Spirit of the Lord.

                                  My Miracle
                                 Maria Sae Yang

           My minister husband and I live in Thailand. We were called to a
        district far from our friends and colleagues. After much prayer, we
        accepted this new assignment. It was difficult for me to move to this
        small village where I didn't know anyone, and had no work.
           I prayed for a ministry in my new village, and felt impressed to
        begin a child-care center as an outreach in this small town. I could
        meet adults by caring for their children. I hoped this would lead to
        Bible studies with some of them. I found a place to operate the
        child care center, and the first day I registered 10 children.
           Then trouble started. Caterpillars invaded the center. They
        came from everywhere. They secreted a poison that made the
        children's skin break out in a rash. I couldn't keep the caterpillars
        off the children. Because of them, some of the children dropped
        out.
           Then mosquitoes swarmed us without mercy. The children
        were being eaten alive. The parents threatened to keep the chil-
        dren home if the problem did not stop. I prayed. "Lord, this is
        Your work. If it is Your will that I continue this child-care
        program, please get rid of these mosquitoes."
            The next day I returned to the child-care center and stuck out
        my arm to test for mosquitoes. I waited a minute—no mosquitoes.
        Five minutes. Ten minutes. Twenty minutes. Still no mosquitoes.
        It was an answer to prayer! A few children came. At nap time,
        they asked me why I didn't cover them with mosquito netting.
        "The mosquitoes are gone," I replied. Then I told them how I
        prayed to my Jesus and He had taken the mosquitoes away. "They
         will not be back ever to bother us again."
            That evening, the children told their parents. One mother could
        not believe the mosquitoes were gone. I told her about my prayer.
         She stayed all day to see if it was really true. Then she told the
         entire village—no more mosquitoes! The next week 20 children
         came to the child-care center. In a couple of weeks our numbers
         grew to 40, then to 60. Many cried when I had no more room in
         the program.
            I can minister to these people because Jesus honored my prayer
         and my desire to serve Him. The Lord is waiting to pour out
         blessings to those who claim His promises to do His work.

           Coming to the Help
              of the Lord




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Judges 4, 5.

   MEMORY TEXT: "My heart goes out to the commanders of
   Israel who offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless
   the Lord" (Judges 5:9, NRSV).

   KEY THOUGHT: God gives victory to His people when they and
their leaders willingly unite in worship, obedience, trust, and service,
whatever the personal risks involved. Those who choose not to take
part in this effort lose their share in the blessing of victory.

   EVERY SPIRITUAL ATHLETE IN THE CHURCH IS IM-
PORTANT. The smallest high school in the district wants to win the
track-and-field trophies. This is possible only with a high level of
participation, commitment, and effort on the part of the students.
Every student who has ability in running, jumping, or throwing pre-
pares for months in advance for the yearly event. The big day arrives.
Muscles strain. Sweat flows. Voices grow hoarse from cheering. The
small school wins!
   There are many situations in which full participation is needed. A
sports team needs all its members in order to be competitive. An
orchestra needs every player. A church needs every member.
   In the church's mission to the world, full participation and coopera-
tion can mean the difference between victory and defeat. The same
principle was true in the time of Deborah and Barak, when their
makeshift Israelite army took on the powerful Canaanite forces of
Jabin and Sisera.

DEBORAH AND BARAK (Judg. 4:1-10).

   The apostasies of the Israelites became continually worse (Judg.
2:19), and their punishments became worse. Whereas they served
Cushan-rishathaim for eight years (Judg. 3:8) and were subjugated by
Eglon for 18 years (verse 14), they were cruelly oppressed by King
Jabin of northern Canaan for 20 years (Judg. 4:3). Enemies were
coming from places ever closer to home: Mesopotamia (northeast of
Canaan), Moab (close by Canaan to the southeast), and then from the
north of Canaan itself.
   Whereas Othniel and Ehud were apparently called directly by God
(Judg. 3:10, 15), Barak was called through Deborah, a prophetess
(Judg. 4:4-7). Because of her prophetic gift, the Israelites submitted
their legal cases to her for judgment (verses 4, 5; compare Lev. 24:13,
14; Num. 36:5).

   Can you think of other women in the Bible who were specially
inspired by God?

Exod. 15:20, 21

2 Kings 22:12-20

Luke 2:36

Acts 21:9

   Barak accepted Deborah's prophetic gift and believed that God
would use him to deliver Israel (Heb. 11:32, 33). But he insisted that
she go with him (Judg. 4:8). Asking a woman to put herself in mortal
danger by going into a battle situation was highly unusual. Even more
surprising is the fact that she agreed to go (verse 9). Her courage,
based upon absolute trust in the word of God, is astounding.

   Why did Barak want Deborah to go with him? Judg. 4:4-7; 5:7.


   Deborah, an established leader (Judg. 4:4), had initiated the action.
Her presence would inspire soldiers with confidence in the reliability
of God's message of victory. She would go where she had told others
to go. Also, if a woman could go to the battle, any able-bodied man
who did not go would risk the humiliation of cowardice!

    Are we willing to accept messages from God that are de-

GENERAL IN TENT TO KILL (Judg. 4:11-22).

   When Barak asked Deborah to go with him, she said: "I will surely
go with you; nevertheless, the road on which you are going will not
lead to your glory, for the Lord will sell Sisera into the hand of a
woman" (Judg. 4:9, NRSV). It is natural to assume that Deborah was
referring to herself as overcoming Sisera.
   Surprise! Another woman enters the story. She is Jael (pronounced
Ya-ale), a tent dweller of the Kenites, who were related to the Israel-
ites through Moses (verses 11, 17).
   While most Kenites remained in the south (Judg. 1:16), the family
of Jael had moved to the north, where they were on peaceful terms with
Jabin (Judg. 4:17).

   In what predicament did General Sisera find himself? Judg.
4:12-17.


   Sisera's fearsome iron chariots and army were gone, destroyed by
the Lord through Barak's army. Footsore and weary, he finally found a
place of refuge and rest in a Kenite camp. Jael went out of her way to
be helpful, inviting him into her tent and hiding him there (verse 18).
She went out of her way to be hospitable, giving him milk to drink
instead of water (verse 19). And when he fell asleep, she went out of
her way to be helpful to the Israelites! Her real loyalties were with
them and with the Lord. She could have waited until Barak arrived to
deal with Sisera (verse 22), but instead, she was courageous enough to
dispose of the general herself (verse 21).

   Compare the role of Jael (Judg. 4:17-22) to that of Ehud (Judg.
3:15-25) in terms of the way they acted and the results that they
achieved for the Israelites.


   Ehud had acted alone in assassinating Eglon and leading the Israel-
ites against the Moabites (Judg. 3:15-30), but God used a team against
Jabin: Deborah, Barak, and Jael. Jael was to Sisera what Ehud was to
Eglon. Both Ehud and Jael acted in response to God's command to
destroy His enemies. Their acts were not murder; they were punitive
acts, capital punishment, commanded by God, of those whose proba-
tion had closed. (See Judg. 5:24-27; Acts 5:1-11; Heb. 10:26-31.)

   In our setting, what are the results when we, as a team,
cooperate with Christ in the spiritual battle of delivering sinners
from the power of Satan? Acts 2:43-47.

VICTORY SONG (Judg. 4:23-5:31).

   The name Deborah means "bee," and Barak means "lightning."
Their forces struck like lightning and stung like a bee. After the main
battle, King Jabin was still alive in Hazor (Judg. 4:2), one of the
largest cities of ancient Palestine. But the Israelites went on to destroy
him too (verse 24).
   At the end of the climactic day of battle ("on that day," Judg. 5:1;
compare 4:14, 23), Deborah and Barak sang a victory song, a national
anthem of praise to God (Judges 5).

  What are the main themes of Deborah and Barak's song?
Judges 5.


   Since the Hebrew song preserves many ancient poetic features and
words, it is among the most difficult passages in the Bible to translate.
Nevertheless, the poem clearly emphasizes the same overall idea as
the preceding narrative: deliverance by God through human beings
who fully cooperated with Him and trusted in His strength. Compare
Judges 4:14: "Then Deborah said to Barak, 'Up! For this is the day on
which the Lord has given Sisera into your hand. The Lord is indeed
going out before you" (NRSV).
   The song begins with a reminder that God was with the Israelites at
the time of their journey toward Canaan in the time of Moses (Judg.
5:2-5; compare Deut. 33:1, 2). Then the song describes the situation in
Israel before the battle (Judg. 5:6-8), tells of the call to battle and its
success (verses 9-13), and lists tribes who answered the call and those
who failed to do so (verses 14-18). The remainder of the song vividly
recounts the battle itself (verses 19-22), curses the inhabitants of
Meroz for not helping when their assistance was of vital importance
(verse 23), and portrays the death of Sisera (verses 24-31).

   Why do you think a conversation between Sisera's mother and
the wisest of her ladies is included? Judg. 5:28-30.


   How ironic that the wisest of the Canaanite ladies imagined that
Sisera was delayed by victory! Their "wisdom" was completely wrong
because they did not take the God of Israel into account.

    What different results do we experience when we rely on
 God's wisdom rather than our own? (Compare Gen. 3:6 with
1 Cor. 1:18-31.)


                                                                       33

WILLINGLY COMING TO THE HELP OF THE LORD (Judg. 5:2,
9, 13-18, 23).

   The song of Deborah and Barak praises the Lord for the Israel-
ites who volunteered to go into battle (Judg. 5:2, 9). What is the
effect of willingly contributing to the service of God?

Exod. 32:26-29

Exod. 35:4-9, 21-29; 36:2-7

1 Chron. 29:5-9, 14-18

Neh. 11:1, 2

2 Cor. 9:6-15

   When Jesus sent out His disciples to preach and heal, He said to
them: "Freely you have received, freely give" (Matt. 10:8, NIV).
When we acknowledge that we have received freely from God, we are
ready to give freely to His service. Through Christ and His sacrifice,
God gives us salvation as a gift (Rom. 3:24; Titus 3:4-7) because He
loves us (John 3:16). If we respond with gratitude and love for Him,
we will happily give of ourselves to His cause, which is the salvation
of others like ourselves. God can use wholehearted, enthusiastic serv-
ice to achieve great results, as the stories of Caleb, Othniel, and the
other heroes of the book of Judges demonstrate.
   Many Israelites rushed forth to battle at the heels of Barak (Judg.
5:15), risking their lives (verse 18). But others hesitated, not contribut-
ing what they could have (verses 15-17). Singled out for a terrible
curse were the people of the town of Meroz (verse 23).

   What was so wrong about what the people of Meroz did, or
rather, failed to do? Judg. 5:23.


   "The Israelite inhabitants of Meroz, on the path of the retreating
hosts of Sisera, refused to render assistance in any form. With the aid
of these men the pursuing Israelites could probably have prevented
any of the Canaanites, perhaps even Sisera, from escaping the field of
battle."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2, p. 336.

RETELL THE TRIUMPHS OF THE LORD (J udg. 5:11).

   In their song, Deborah and Barak spoke of retelling the victories of
the Lord (Judg. 5:11), which He had won on behalf of His people.

  Compare Judges 5 with other songs of deliverance by God that
are recorded in the Bible. Exod. 15:1-21; Psalm 107; Isaiah 12;
Rev. 15:3, 4. What is the effect of such triumphant celebration?


   The song of Deborah and Barak begins with a reminder of God's
presence when the Israelites journeyed toward Canaan (Judg. 5:2-5).
The rest of the song, telling of deliverance from King Jabin and Sisera,
shows that God was again with His people in the time of Deborah and
Barak. They could trust God completely in the present and in the
future because He had demonstrated His trustworthiness time and
again.
   "We have nothing to fear for the future, except as we shall forget
the way the Lord has led us, and His teaching in our past history."
—Ellen G. White, Life Sketches, p. 196.

  What did God's greatest triumph accomplish? Col. 1:13, 14;
Rev. 15:2-4.


    Oppression by Pharaoh, Jabin, and Sisera is nothing compared with
subjection to Satan, who through deceit usurped the dominion that
God gave to Adam and Eve (Gen. 3:1-24). But at the price of incred-
ible self-sacrifice, the Lord has delivered from the power of Satan all
who have believed in Him and has made them citizens of His kingdom,
under His protection.
    Just before His crucifixion, Jesus said, "Now is the judgment of this
world, now the ruler of this world will be driven out. And I, when I am
lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself" (John 12:31,
32, NRSV). Jesus is the ultimate Judge-Deliverer. By dying the death
of the wicked in place of human beings, He delivered His willing ones
by casting out Satan as having any claim to authority over human
beings. At His second coming, Christ will take over the world, exercis-
ing the right that He bought with His blood (Rev. 19:11-20:3).

    Why are personal testimonies to the triumphs of the Lord in
 individual lives so powerful? Mark 5:18-20.




                                                                     35

FURTHER STUDY: Reconsider the relationship between faith and
the punitive work performed by Deborah and Barak (Heb. 11:32-34).
Read the SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2, pp. 333-337, on Judges 5,
the song of Deborah and Barak.

   "True Christian character is marked by a singleness of purpose, an
indomitable determination, which refuses to yield to worldly influ-
ences, which will aim at nothing short of the Bible standard. If men
will permit themselves to become discouraged in the service of God,
the great adversary will present abundant reasons to turn them from the
plain path of duty to one of ease and irresponsibility. Those who can
be bribed or seduced, discouraged or terrified, will be of no service in
the Christian warfare. Those who set their affections on worldly treas-
ures or worldly honors, will not push the battle against principalities
and powers, and spiritual wickedness in high places."—Ellen G. White,
"A Test of Faith," Signs of the Times, June 30, 1881.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How single-minded and determined are you to overcome
     the power of Satan, by Christ's strength, in your own life
     and in your ministry for others? If you lack such determi-
     nation, how do you get it? (See Acts 4:12, 23-31.)

   2. How can we have an "indomitable determination, which
      refuses to yield to worldly influences," and "push the battle
      against principalities and powers" and at the same time be
      sensitive to the needs of those with whom we come in con-
      tact? Study this question in the context of Jesus' life. For
      example, compare John 2:13-17 and Matt. 23:13-36 with
      Matt. 23:37; 12:20. See also Ellen G. White, Steps to Christ,
      p. 12: "Tears were in His voice as He uttered His scathing
      rebukes."

   3. Even though we are never called today to perform the kind
      of work to which God directed Ehud and Jael, are Chris-
      tians today sometimes called to unpleasant duties? (See Matt.
      18:15-20; 1 Corinthians 5.)

SUMMARY: Under Deborah and Barak, the Israelites were victori-
ous because they trusted in God's power to deliver them from superior
forces. Their faith was shown by their actions. Without works resulting
from our faith, our faith is dead (James 2:26).

           South Sudan has been caught in a civil war for years. In spite of
        the hardships of war, Adventist congregations are springing up in
        many places.
            It was Sabbath morning. We had flown into Akobo, a village
        near the Ethiopian border of Sudan, with a United Nations relief
        mission. It had rained heavily all night, and the dirt roads were
        sloppy mud. We sloshed through the mud toward the church. At
        one place it was so deep that I lost my balance and landed in the
        mud. After a quick clean-up we entered the church, built of sticks,
        mud, and grass. As our eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, we
        counted 20 people gathered for worship. The rains had kept away
        many members who walk great distances to church.
            The little church, we learned, had been established by Chot
        Thich Dok, an evangelist from another denomination who had
        heard the Adventist message while in a refugee camp in Ethiopia.
        The message convicted his heart, and he joined the church in 1987.
        When he returned to Sudan he was tempted to settle with other
        Adventist refugees in the border town of Maiwut. But he felt the
        burden to share his new faith with his own people in Akobo.
            When he arrived in Akobo in 1992 and began witnessing to
        colleagues from his former church, he met great opposition. They
        tried to convince government authorities to forbid the Adventist
        presence in Akobo, but they were told not to interfere with Adventists.
        Chot, his wife, and another young man built the church. In the
         past two years Chot has brought many into the church. Some still
         wait for a pastor to come and baptize them.
            The church building is already too small. Chot wants to build a
         bigger church, closer to the river so more people can come by boat.
         He has only three years of education and wants to establish an
         Adventist school to teach the adults and children of the growing
         Adventist church.
             Chot works full time in construction. He hopes that soon a lay
         preacher will come to teach the many who are ready to accept the
         Adventist message. He sees a great potential for raising up new
         companies in the nearby villages along the river.
             Our members can build churches with their own hands, but they
         need education and trained pastors and lay preachers. Pray that the
         work in this region will expand to every town and village.

              Signs of Security




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Judges 6.

   MEMORY TEXT: "When Gideon realized that it was the angel
   of the Lord, he exclaimed, `Ah, Sovereign Lord! I have seen the
   angel of the Lord face to face!' But the Lord said to him,
   `Peace! Do not be afraid. You are not going to die' " (Judges
   6:22, 23, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: When God calls people to work for Him, He
gives them the assurance that He will be with them. At times, He may
reinforce this assurance with miraculous or providential signs.

   THE FATHER'S HAND. A tiger pads softly along a pathway
toward a two-year-old girl. She watches intently through the bushes as
the large animal approaches. Stepping into the pathway a few feet in
front of the tiger, she says, "Rarrrrrrr!" Little Sarah roars at the tiger
without fear, not because she notices the thick chain around the tiger's
neck, held by a trainer of Marine World, Africa U.S.A., but because
she firmly clutches her father's hand. As far as she is concerned,
Daddy is big and strong enough to take care of any situation.
   Adults need security too. We saw in the last lesson that Barak
needed Deborah, the prophetess, to provide him with security by
accompanying him into danger. When God called Gideon to deliver
Israel, he was insecure about the whole idea, but he had nobody like
Deborah to help him. He had to rely upon God directly, making sure
that his heavenly Father was with him.

OPPRESSED AND DEPRESSED AGAIN (Judg. 6:1-10).

   After the deliverance from Jabin and Sisera, "the land had rest forty
years" (Judg. 5:31, NRSV). But after a while, the people no longer
guided their lives by the Lord and His triumphs, and they fell back into
idolatry. The result was depression, not merely emotional but eco-
nomic, as well. Whereas the Israelites had survived 20 years of oppres-
sion under Jabin and Sisera, they were driven to desperation after only
seven years of plundering by the Midianites (Judg. 6:1).

   What was so devastating about what the Midianites did? Judg.
6:2-6.


   "Inasmuch as the Midianites were nomadic tribes, they did not
conquer the land and settle down permanently. . . . They preferred that
the settled peoples should do the work of sowing. Then in a series of
raids they would sweep over the land, confiscating the crops and
driving off all the farm animals they could find. According to custom,
they left the houses undestroyed in order that the farmers would be
tempted to return and sow the fields once more."—SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 2, pp. 339, 341.
   The Midianites, along with the Amalekites and other "people of the
East," were like locusts in terms of their numbers, and also in terms of
their effect on the land (Judg. 6:3-5; compare Joel 2:4-10). After
losing their crops for seven years in a row, the Israelites were starving.
When they were "greatly impoverished" (Judg. 6:6), they were ready
for the Lord again. But the Lord did not respond to their cry for help by
immediately promising to deliver them. While He had their attention,
He sent them an unnamed prophet to explain the cause of their distress
(Judg. 6:7-10) so that they would be wiser in the future.

  Compare the words of the prophet (Judg. 6:8-10) to the earlier
message of the Angel of the Lord at Bochim (Judg. 2:1-3).


   The prophet reiterated the overall theme of the book of Judges: In
spite of God's faithfulness, the Israelites persisted in faithless disobedi-
ence. By breaking God's covenant, they forfeited complete fulfillment
of the covenant promises.

    Do you tend to rely on God most when you are "brought very
 low"? Why, or why not? Why do we tend to blame God for trials
 that we have brought upon ourselves?


                                                                        39

THE CALL OF GIDEON (Judg. 6:11-16).

   The "judges" were called by God in various ways. Ehud was simply
raised up by the Lord (Judg. 3:15), Othniel was designated as Israel's
deliverer by the Spirit of the Lord coming upon him (verse 10), and
Barak was called through the prophetess Deborah (Judg. 4:6, 7).
Gideon's call was special. The Angel of the Lord appeared to him in
person.

   Read Judges 6:11-16 carefully, looking for the significance of
(1) the circumstances in which the conversation between Gideon
and the Angel took place and (2) the ideas that were expressed in
the course of the conversation.


   Wheat was normally threshed on a threshing floor, but Gideon was
threshing wheat in a wine press, where the Midianites would not look
for it. At this low point in his life, as he was hiding his food for fear of
the Midianites, the Angel of the Lord appeared to him.
   The first words of the Angel were: "The Lord is with thee, thou
mighty man of valour" (Judg. 6:12). Gideon questioned this statement.
He had heard of the past triumphs of the Lord for the Israelites, but he
did not see how He could be with them at the present time. "Then the
Lord turned to him and said, 'Go in this might of yours and deliver
Israel from the hand of Midian; I hereby commission you' " (verse 14,
NRSV). So the Angel was the Lord Himself, and Gideon was to be the
deliverer!
   The Angel had twice referred to Gideon's might. It was true that
Gideon's brothers, and probably Gideon himself, had been involved in
military action against Midian (Judg. 8:18, 19), but he did not regard
himself as qualified to lead Israel. He claimed to have less power than
anyone else in the tribe of Manasseh. "The Lord said to him, 'But I
will be with you"' (Judg. 6:16, NRSV). The Lord Himself would be
with Gideon! That was all the power he needed!

   Compare the call of Gideon with that of Moses (Exod.
3:1-4:17) and Jeremiah (Jer. 1:4-10).


   God could use people like Moses, Gideon, and Jeremiah because
they recognized their own inadequacy and relied upon His strength
rather than their own.

   Is it a lack of faith to request evidence from God? How would
 you support your point of view?

THE ANGEL OF THE LORD (Judg. 6:11-16).

  How is the identity of the "angel of the Lord" revealed in
Judges 6:11-16?


   Whereas the Being who spoke with Gideon is first called the "angel
of the Lord" (Judg. 6:11, 12), He is subsequently identified as "the
Lord" (verses 14, 16). Thus, the initial words, "The Lord is with thee"
(verse 12), mean the same thing as the later statement, "I will be with
thee" (verse 16). Note that "the Lord" in these verses translates the
Hebrew word Yahweh, which means "Jehovah."
   Compare the Gideon story with the story of the "angel of the Lord"
appearing to Samson's parents (Judges 13). The Angel appeared in
human form (verse 6), but He was the Lord (verses 21-23).

  In the Gideon and Samson stories (Judges 6, 13), why is the
Lord called "the angel of the Lord"?


   In the Old and New Testaments, the Hebrew and Greek words
translated "angel" mean "messenger." We associate this term with
created beings sent forth by God. (See Heb. 1:6, 7, 13, 14; Dan. 9:21;
Luke 1:26.) But sometimes the Lord has appeared to deliver messages
in person (Genesis 18).
    In Exodus 23:20, 21, God spoke of "an angel" whom He sent to
bring the Israelites to the Promised Land. "Be attentive to him . . . for
my name is in him" (verse 21, NRSV). Ellen G. White comments:
"Christ was not only the leader of the Hebrews in the wilderness—the
Angel in whom was the name of Jehovah, and who, veiled in the
cloudy pillar, went before the host—but it was He who gave the law to
Israel. Amid the awful glory of Sinai, Christ declared in the hearing of
all the people the ten precepts of His Father's law."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, p. 366.
    It appears that occasions such as those mentioned above must be
included among the "goings forth from of old" of the divine Messiah
born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2). This birth has brought to humankind
the ultimate manifestation of the Lord in human form: Jesus Christ,
"God with us" (Matt. 1:23). In John 1:1-5, 9-14, Jesus is not only
 identified as the divine Creator, who has become human in order to
communicate with us; He is called "the Word," the content of the
 message itself.

   In view of the personal care that the Lord has invested in His
 messages to us, how should we demonstrate our respect for them?

                                                                     41

SIGNS FROM GOD (Judg. 6:17-24, 36-40).

   Gideon asked for a sign confirming the divine identity of the One
who was speaking with him (Judg. 6:17). Since the encounter was so
unusual and so much depended upon it, this request was reasonable
enough. Keep in mind that Gideon did not have in front of him the
words of the Bible, which identify his Visitor as "the Lord" (verses 11,
12, 14, 16). What he saw and heard was a Being, presumably in human
form, sitting under an oak tree (verse 11).

   Why did Gideon's sign take the form of a food offering? Judg.
6:18, 19.


   Gideon might have thought that if his Visitor were the divine Angel
of the Lord, He would not consume food as a human being would.
Israelite sanctuary sacrifices were called "food" for the Lord (Num.
28:2), but He did not consume them in a human manner because He
does not need human food at all (Ps. 50:12, 13).
   The "angel of the Lord" identified Himself by not eating the food
but miraculously burning it. Then He vanished (Judg. 6:20, 21; com-
pare Judg. 13:15-20). Whether or not Gideon had thought that some-
thing like this could happen, when it did, he was amazed and afraid
because he had "seen the angel of the Lord face to face" (verse 22,
NRSV; compare Judg. 13:21, 22). Reassured by the Lord, he built an
altar to commemorate His appearance there (Judg. 6:23, 24; compare
Gen. 28:17, 18, 22).
   Feeling insecure, Gideon later sought miraculous confirmation from
the Lord that He would deliver Israel as He had promised (Judg. 6:36,
37)

   Why did Gideon request a second test with the fleece? Judg.
6:38-40.


   "The first sign that Gideon asked was granted. The fleece gathered
water, and the ground around it was dry. After thinking it over, Gideon
felt that this was, after all, what one would expect, since wool naturally
draws water. Hence it might not be a sign at all. He may thus have felt
as uncertain as before. . . . Recognizing Gideon's limited faith, the
Lord condescended to work a miracle to give him the sign for which he
asked."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2, p. 345.

    What dangers do you see in placing undue reliance on signs
 that we have stipulated? (See Heb. 11:1.)

FIRST THINGS FIRST (Judg. 6:25-35).

   Before the Lord could use Gideon, He required him to purge idola-
try from his family (Judg. 6:25, 26). "Gideon must declare war upon
idolatry before going out to battle with the enemies of his people."
—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 547.
   Destroying the Baal altar and the Asherah, which may have been a
sacred pole or tree trunk, plus building an altar to the Lord and
offering a sacrifice, was a big job, but Gideon did it in one night (Judg.
6:27). The next morning, idolatrous Israelites wanted to put Gideon to
death for insulting Baal (verses 28-30), but his father defended him on
the ground that if Baal were really a god, he could punish Gideon
himself (verse 31; compare 1 Kings 18:20-29). Gideon's father pre-
vailed. It appears that he was turning to faith in the God of Israel, who
had appeared to his son.
   Can you think of other cases in which reform preceded deliverance
by God?

Gen. 35:1-5

Exod. 4:21-26

Judg. 10:16

2 Chron. 17:3-6

2 Kings 18:1-7

   God cannot accept the prayers of those who cherish iniquity in their
hearts (Ps. 66:18). When sin is cherished, confidence is false and turns
to defeat (Joshua 7:1). The quickest way to destroy God's people is to
entice them into disobedience, thereby driving a wedge between them
and their God (Num. 25:1-3). The greatest evidence that sin separates
one from God is found in the death of Christ, who was separated from
His Father (Matt. 27:46) because He became sin for us (2 Cor. 5:21).
   On the other hand, the Lord is eager "to give repentance" (Acts
5:31). As soon as His people put away those things that come between
Him and them, He is ready to help them (Judg. 10:16). After Gideon's
reform, the next time the Midianites and their allies crossed the Jor-
dan, the Spirit of the Lord took possession of Gideon, and he sum-
moned the Israelites to a war of liberation (Judg. 6:33-35).

   How can we rid ourselves of the idols that separate us from
 God?


                                                                      43

FURTHER STUDY: Review what Jesus said about trusting Him
even when there are no outward signs: John 20:29. Read Ellen G.
White, Patriarchs and Prophets, "The Earlier Judges," pp. 546-548.

   "The Lord does not always choose for his work men of the greatest
talents, but he selects those whom he can best use. Individuals who
might do good service for God, may for a time be left in obscurity,
apparently unnoticed and unemployed by their Master. But if they
faithfully perform the duties of their humble position, cherishing a
willingness to labor and to sacrifice for him, he will in his own time
intrust them with greater responsibilities."—Ellen G. White, Signs of
the Times, June 23, 1881.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. God gave signs to Gideon, and Jesus performed many miracles,
     which were signs of His divinity. Why did Jesus refuse to
     grant the request of scribes and Pharisees for a sign, except
     for "the sign of the prophet Jonah" (Matt. 12:38-41; 16:1-4,
     NRSV)? Compare Jesus' refusal to give Satan a sign of His
     divinity (Matt. 4:3, 4). Do you sometimes look for miracu-
     lous signs for wrong reasons?

  2. God required Gideon to do something that offended some
     Israelites by attacking their form of worship. Did these
     people have a just basis for being offended? Does God ever
     ask us to do or say things that result in offending people? If
     so, how do we know that it is God who is behind this, and
     not our own emotions or prejudices? Does our own tactless-
     ness cause problems in these situations? Does fear that we
     may offend someone keep us from saying things that should
     be said?

SUMMARY: Gideon's confidence in God needed to grow, but God
could use him because he was not self-confident. He needed repeated
assurances that God was with him, but then he went ahead and faith-
fully did what God asked him to do, beginning with reform in his own
family. As by faith we accept God's assurances, He imparts to us the
strength and wisdom to carry out His will.

             While living in Guanare, in central Venezuela, I served as
         treasurer of a school. One day I entered a shop and began talking
         with the manager. He invited me to buy some of his fresh cheese.
             "I would like to, but I have no money with me," I said.
             "You have money; you are the school treasurer," he accused.
             "But the school's money is not mine," I countered.
             "All that one has in his pocket belongs to him," he answered.
             "I'm sorry, I don't agree with you," I said. "The school's money
         is not mine. If you want to audit my books, I am ready."
             A young man in the shop heard our conversation. He asked,
         "Do you belong to a religion?" I smelled alcohol on his breath.
             "Yes, I am a Seventh-day Adventist."
             He said he was impressed with my honesty. Then he told me, "I
         want my family to go to a church like the one you go 10. Would you
         visit my family?" He gave me directions to a poor section of town.
             I promised to visit the family the following Tuesday. At the
         appointed time my pastor husband and I went to visit the man's
         home. This time the man was not drunk.
             We enjoyed visiting and getting acquainted with the family.
         Before we left we made arrangements to begin studying the Bible
         together. The family had no religious training, but the children,
         ages 8 to 14, enjoyed the Bible stories, and the adults studied the
          Bible eagerly and accepted the truths we presented.
             About two months later we invited the family to attend church
         with us. The man's wife and children went, but the man was not
          ready. He was still struggling with alcohol. We loved and prayed
         for him. The Bible study group grew as the family invited their
          friends. Eventually we had about 15 people in this group study.
             The girls, ages 13 and 14, were baptized first. A few months
          later the boys, 8 and 10, and their mother were baptized. The
                                   husband struggled for several more months
     I                             before he gained victory over alcohol and
                                   was baptized.
                                      The little group now meets in a hall and
                                   continues to grow. All this happened be-
                                   cause of a conversation over a piece of

          A Few Good People




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Judg. 7:1-8:21.

   MEMORY TEXT: "And the Lord said to Gideon, 'The people
   who are with you are too many for Me to give the Midianites
   into their hands, lest Israel claim glory for itself against Me,
   saying, "My own hand has saved me" ' " (Judges 7:2, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: For the benefit of His people, God wants them
to cooperate with Him in achieving His purposes. But they should
keep in mind that it is God who gives success; they are only instru-
ments in His hands.

   BEATING THE ODDS. God loves to show who He is by over-
coming obstacles that are, humanly speaking, insurmountable. Three
hundred Israelites battling 135,000 Midianites and their allies? Un-
thinkable! (See Judg. 7:12; 8:10.) Five loaves and two fish to feed
5,000 men, besides women and children? Absurd! (See Matt. 14:15-
21.) A handful of people to shake up an empire with "good news"
about an executed Carpenter? Preposterous! (See the book of Acts.) A
Jewish girl to give birth to God's Son without losing her virginity?
Impossible! (See Luke 1:37, 38—Gabriel said, " 'For nothing will be
impossible with God.' Then Mary said, 'Here am I, the servant of the
Lord; let it be with me according to your word' "[NRSV].)
   When you feel alone and powerless, overwhelmed by unfavorable
odds (1 Kings 19:9, 10), remember the words of Gabriel to Mary and
her response. God often demonstrates His love for His children by
doing that which, to them, seems impossible. If our eyes could be
opened, we would see invincible heavenly forces guarding and guid-
ing our lives.

LESS IS BETTER (Judg. 7:1-8).

   For an initial strike force against the Midianites and their allies, all
God needed was a few good men. Thirty-two thousand Israelites
answered Gideon's trumpet call (Judg. 6:34, 35; 7:3). By a two-stage
process of elimination, God sent 31,700 of them home!

   Why did God choose only 300 men? Judg. 7:7, 8.


   Which of the following best answers the question?
1. God did not want to use too many Israelites, lest they attribute their
   success to their own power (Judg. 7:2).
2. God could not use the 22,000 who admitted their fear by returning
   home at the first opportunity (verse 3; compare Deut. 20:5-8).
   Except for 300 men, even the 10,000 who remained after the proc-
   lamation lacked sufficient courage, so God could not use an army
   of 10,000, as He had in Barak's day (Judg. 4:10).
3. God wanted only the 300 who were eager to fight. When they went
   to a stream, expecting to cross it and keep marching to the enemy
   camp, they drank by scooping up water in their hands as they went
   (Judg. 7:4-6).
4. Another answer:

5. All the above.

   What did the actions of the 300 chosen warriors, even before
they went into battle, indicate regarding their relationship with
God? Judg. 7:3-7.


   The enemy hordes appeared innumerable (Judg. 7:12; 8:10). Israel-
ites who were eager to attack such a force must have wholeheartedly
believed in the Lord and the message of victory that He had given to
Gideon (Judg. 6:16). From a human point of view, their venture was
foolhardy, but "God's foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and
God's weakness is stronger than human strength" (1 Cor. 1:25, NRSV).
As Jonathan put it, "Nothing can hinder the Lord from saving by many
or by few" (1 Sam. 14:6, NRSV). For those who are willing to follow
the Lord into spiritual battle, courage is not optional. He commands it
because He provides it (Deut. 20:1-4; Joshua 1:6, 7, 9).

   How does the presence of Christ with us affect our courage as
 we carry God's love into territory claimed by Satan? (See Matt.
28:18-20.)

                                                                        47

DREAM TEAM (Judg. 7:9-15).

   Gideon was still afraid. The Angel of the Lord had appeared to him
and performed a miraculous sign (Judg. 6:21), and God had granted
him a double sign with fleece (verses 36-40). Now the time for battle
had almost arrived, and he had only 300 men. He had scarcely dared to
ask God for the second sign with the fleece (verse 39), so requesting
another sign was out of the question. Recognizing his insecurity, God
took the initiative and offered him the sign he needed (Judg. 7:9-11).

   What is the relationship between the Midianite's dream and its
interpretation? Judg. 7:13, 14.


   The dream was symbolic. The enemy soldier dreamed that a piece
of barley bread, food of people such as the impoverished Israelites,
tumbled into the Midianite camp and did something ordinarily impos-
sible: it knocked a tent over. Just so, Gideon and his team would carry
out a miracle of God by destroying the Midianite forces.
   The dream was also ironic. The Midianites had stolen Israelite
food. In the dream, a piece of food out of control by the Midianites
knocked their tent over, bringing their wickedness down upon their
own heads. (Compare Judg. 9:57.) They had also taken the lives of
Israelites, including Gideon's brothers (Judg. 8:18, 19). Now Gideon,
who had escaped the control of the Midianites, would punish them,
not only for taking Israelite food but also for killing his brothers.
   When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he did not
delay thanking God, but worshiped Him on the spot. Filled with
courage, he returned to the Israelite camp with a triumphant battle cry
(Judg. 7:15).

   What knowledge did Gideon have of the validity of dreams
given by God? Gen. 37:5-10; 40:1-8; 41:1, 16.


   Spoken by enemies, who would not make up stories about Israelite
victory, the dream and its interpretation must be genuine. Dreams from
God were known by the Israelites to predict the future accurately. So
when Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, which agreed with
the words of the Angel of the Lord (Judg. 6:16), his doubts fled.

   In what ways does God give us evidence to strengthen our
faith, even when we do not ask for it? How can we be sure that
"signs" indicating a certain course of action are from God?

SOUND-AND-LIGHT SHOW (Judg. 7:16-25).

   In the night, Gideon divided his 300 men into three groups, sta-
tioned at the outskirts of the Midianite camp.

   How did 300 Israelites defeat a force of 135,000 Midianites and
their allies (Judg. 8:10)? Judg. 7:19-25.


   The sleeping Midianites were awakened by the din of crashing
pottery, the blasting of trumpets, and the sudden appearance of torch
light all around them. It appeared as though they were surrounded by a
large, attacking army. They panicked, each thinking only of his own
safety. Assuming that the attackers had entered the camp, and not
being able to identify one another in the darkness, the Midianites
defended themselves by killing one another: "The Lord set every
man's sword against his fellow and against all the army" (Judg. 7:22,
NRSV). As the Midianites fled, Gideon called the rest of the Israelites
to help pursue the enemy. It appears that when Gideon sent home the
31,700 men, he told them to be ready for action.
   Compare the sound-and-light show that God will provide when He
delivers His end-time people from overwhelming forces of opposition.
(See 1 Thess. 4:16, 17; Matt. 24:27.)

  Since it was God who defeated the Midianites, why did Gideon
need to use strategy (Judg. 7:16-24)?


   This story is a classic case of divine-human cooperation. God won
the battle by optimizing the efficiency of human effort and blessing the
results of that effort. Without the Lord's direction, Gideon would have
attacked the 135,000 enemy soldiers with all 32,000 Israelites who
initially volunteered. God could have brought victory out of such
unfavorable odds, but He had a better way: make the army of 135,000
attack itself! To do this, He needed a small group of daring men who
could serve as a catalyst for panic by sneaking up on the enemy
without being detected and surprising them with a sound-and-light
show. He multiplied the results of the human effort, making sure that
confusion reigned in the camp of the enemy.
   This was not the first time that God had used a small number of
dedicated people to win a great victory. (See Gen. 14:14-16.)

   In our spiritual warfare, in what ways does God ask us to
 cooperate with Him?


                                                                    49

NONSUPPORTIVE FRIENDS (Judg. 8:1-9).

   To destroy the fleeing Midianites, Gideon needed the cooperation
of as many Israelites as possible, but some of his countrymen caused
him trouble.

   Why did the Ephraimites react as they did? Judg. 8:1.


   The Ephraimites helped by cutting off the Midianites at river cross-
ings (Judg. 7:24) but then berated Gideon for not having called them
before the battle when he called other northern tribes (Judg. 6:35).
   Ephraim was the most powerful northern Israelite tribe. It appears
that they were envious of Gideon and insulted by his not consulting
them before attacking the Midianites.
   "In common with the others, they were brave enough to join in the
fray only after the enemy was in flight. Similarly, there are many today
who criticize the one who courageously launches a laudable project.
They hold back any support until it is apparent that the venture will
succeed. Then they attempt to take credit to themselves or to edge in
on the leadership of the enterprise."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2,
p. 351.

   How did Gideon successfully deal with the Ephraimites? Judg.
8:2, 3.


    Gideon had borne the responsibility and risk of the initial attack
upon the enemy. As the divinely appointed leader of the Israelites, he
could have rebuked the Ephraimites. But then, he probably would
have had to fight them as well as the foreigners (compare Judg. 12:
1-6), and there was no time for that. The wise, courteous, and humble
diplomacy of Gideon, praising the success of Ephraim, was just right
for the situation. The book of Proverbs was not yet written, but Gideon
knew that "a soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up
anger" (Prov. 15:1, NRSV).
    Gideon and his 300 men, faint with hunger, were still pursuing the
Midianites, but the men of Succoth (pronounced Soo-cote) and Penuel
were like the people of Meroz earlier: they selfishly refused to help at
all (Judg. 8:4-6, 8; compare 5:23). Gideon regarded them, unlike the
Ephraimites, as traitors and threatened to punish them (Judg. 8:7, 9).

    What are your motives for supporting good causes? Because
 they are good? Or do you support them only when they will
 clearly succeed, so that you can take some credit?

RETRIBUTION FOR DISLOYALTY (Judg. 8:10-21).

   About 15,000 Midianites were left. Gideon and his men surprised
them, threw them into panic, and defeated them, capturing Zebah and
Zalmunna, the kings of Midian (Judg. 8:10-12). The short war was
over. The terribly swift sword of the Lord and of Gideon had prevailed
against overwhelming odds. But Gideon did not immediately go back
to his farming. The "judge" had some judging to do first.

   Why did Gideon take Zebah and Zalmunna to Succoth? Judg.
8:15.


   The men of Succoth and Penuel had ridiculed Gideon for thinking
that he could defeat the thousands of Midianites who were left. They
had refused to help him, because he had not already won the battle and
captured the Midianite kings (Judg. 8:6), and probably because they
expected him to lose and did not want to suffer retaliation from the
Midianites for helping him. Gideon had replied that when (not if!) the
Lord gave the kings to him, he would return and punish them (verses
7, 9).
   When he did capture the kings, Gideon showed them to the people
of Succoth and Penuel to prove that God had, indeed, made him the
judge-deliverer of Israel. But the judgment he gave Succoth and Penuel
was not deliverance; it was divine retribution for disloyalty and un-
faithfulness (verses 13-17).

   What is the significance of the fact that the Midianite kings had
killed Gideon's full brothers? Judg. 8:18-21.


   We expect Gideon, the leader of the Israelite army, to put the
Midianite kings to death. They had opposed Israel's God. Moreover,
Gideon had reason to seek personal justice. In a previous battle at
Tabor, not further described, the kings had shown Gideon's brothers
no mercy. Consequently, they received none.
   This story may partly explain why the Lord chose Gideon. Not only
was he a man of faith; he had a strong personal interest in bringing the
Midianites to justice. He was reticent at first to fight the Midianites,
because he knew firsthand their strength and the risk of battle, but
when God encouraged and motivated him, he was highly motivated!

  Why was it right for Gideon to bring justice upon his enemies,
but it is not right for us? Rom. 12:17-21.

FURTHER STUDY: Read the following passages, which establish
that God forbids us to retaliate against our enemies: Lev. 19:18; Prov.
20:22; 24:29; Matt. 5:39; 1 Peter 3:9. Read Ellen G. White, Patriarchs
and Prophets, "The Earlier Judges," pp. 549-555.

   "Act promptly. God would have you minute men, as were the men
who composed Gideon's army. Many times ministers are too precise,
too calculating. While they are getting ready to do a great work, the
opportunity for doing a good work passes unimproved. The minister
moves as though the whole burden rested on himself, a poor finite
man, when Jesus is carrying him and his burden too. Brethren, trust
self less, and Jesus more. He is willing to save the souls for whom we
labor. Because he lives to intercede for us, we shall see of his great
power. He 'is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or
think.' Jesus wants us to ask for help; he wants us to cast our helpless
souls on him; and he will give us according to our faith."—Ellen G.
White, Advent Review and Sabbath Herald, July 1, 1884.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Do you miss opportunities to serve the Lord? If so, why? Is
     it because you fail to see them until it is too late, or are you
     too inflexible or timid? What can you do to improve your
     ability or desire to take advantage of opportunities for serv-
     ice?

   2. Gideon's venture was successful because he cooperated with
      God. Look for other Bible passages that speak of, or illus-
      trate, divine-human cooperation. (See, for example, John
      6:5-14; 11:39, 41-44; Phil. 2:12, 13. On John 11:39, Ellen
      White wrote: "Christ could have commanded the stone [cov-
      ering Lazarus's tomb] to remove. . . . What human power
      can do divine power is not summoned to do. God does not
      dispense with man's aid. He strengthens him, cooperating
      with him as he uses the powers and capabilities given him."
      —The Desire of Ages, p. 535.)

   3. How can this lesson be used to illustrate the ultimate tri-
      umph of God's faithful remnant who will be opposed by
      apparently superior forces? (See Rev. 6:10, 15-17.)

SUMMARY: Gideon and his men were God's instruments to deliver
Israel. Success depended upon God. Without Him, human efforts
would have failed. But human efforts were important because God
chose to use them. God can use people today who are willing to risk all
in carrying out His will.

      5111.7    The Miracle of the Dagushan Church
                                   David Lin

           About 3,000 Adventist believers in Jilin Province, China, gath-
       ered to dedicate the 600-seat Dagushan Adventist Church recently.
       A series of miracles marked the completion of this church.
           The young lay pastor told how God blessed at every stage of
       construction. After the foundation was laid, the pastor had only
       170 yuan ($20) cash left. He managed to purchase bricks on credit,
       and then borrowed some money to buy lumber. He estimated that
       he needed about $825 worth of wood to make the triangular cross
       beams for the roof. But he had less than $50. With this meager
       sum, he set out on his bike, praying that the Lord would lead him
       to lumber he could afford.
           The pastor was so weary from working day and night that he
       stopped beside the road and slept. When he awoke he got on his
       bicycle and began riding. Soon he met a man walking on the road.
       The pastor stopped and asked the man if he knew where he could
       find some lumber. The man answered, "I have some." The pastor
       followed the man to his farm, where a large grove of trees stood. It
       was enough to build the cross beams, so the pastor offered the man
       800 yuan, about $95 for it. He paid the man the 400 yuan he had
       with him, and pedaled back to town to borrow the remaining 400
       yuan and a tractor and trailer to haul the logs. Thus the lumber,
       which would have cost $825 at a lumber yard, cost less than $100.
           A carpenter and a mason were the only two skilled laborers
       hired to work on the church. Every evening they kidded the pastor
       with the question, "Out of cash again?" And every time the pastor
       replied, "Yes, out of cash." But the next day there was always
        work to keep the construction going, and somehow, cash to pay
       these men. Surely God was in charge.
           Using the skills of church members, the church was finished in
       4 months at a total cost of about $10,000. On the day of the
       dedication, the church still owed about $4,700. Offerings that day
       raised more than $1,500, and a generous gift by a brother in
        Beijing cleared the remaining deficit.
           A baptism held the day after the dedication brought church
        membership to 1,000. The work in China is growing rapidly under
        the leadership of dedicated laymen and women. Pray that God will
        strengthen and unite the work and the workers there.

      Royalty and Disloyalty




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Judg. 8:22-9:57.

   MEMORY TEXT: "And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule
   over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the Lord shall rule
   over you" (Judges 8:23).

   KEY THOUGHT: A person's relationship with God is reflected in
the way he or she treats other human beings. Thus, loyalty to God as
Lord leads to human kindness, but rejection of God as Lord leads to
ingratitude, selfish pride, and cruel ruthlessness.

   THE COST OF KINGSHIP. Ever since Lucifer came up with the
idea of being like the Most High (Isa. 14:14) and deceived the human
race into accepting his philosophy (see Gen. 3:5—"you shall be as
gods"), people have played God and lorded it over others. From
earliest times, kingship has been likened to and associated with divine
power. The Egyptian pharaohs, Mesopotamian kings, and Hittite em-
perors, to name a few, even demanded and received worship as gods.
With their awesome authority, ancient kings claimed to be the "shep-
herds" of their people, providing for their protection and well-being.
But the price was high (1 Sam. 8:10-18).
   When Gideon was offered the kingship of Israel, he was not offered
the kind of constitutional monarchy that many nations have today. He
recognized that to take that position would be to substitute despotic
human rule for God's authority, to play God (Judg. 8:23). But his son,
who did not respect God or people, wanted to be king at all costs. The
price to others was high, and in the end, so was the price to him.

"THE LORD WILL RULE OVER YOU" (Judg. 8:22, 23, MV).

   Gideon had led Israel to victory over kings, and he looked like a
king (Judg. 8:18). The Israelites were so grateful that they asked him
to be their king (verse 22).

   What do the words of the Israelites to Gideon reveal about
their attitude toward God? Judg. 8:22.


   Where was the Israelites' gratitude to God? They clearly wanted a
permanent leadership institution to unite and organize their tribes for
protection against their enemies. Their oppressors were ruled by kings,
so they wanted a king too. How quickly they had forgotten that the
kings who oppressed them had been defeated by divine-human co-
operation!
   The offer of a dynastic kingship ("and your son and your grandson
also," Judg. 8:22, NRSV) must have been attractive. Once again, as at
the time of the crisis with Ephraim (verses 1-3), Gideon showed
restraint, wisdom, and humility. Refusing the offer, he exalted the
kingship of the Lord as the ideal for Israelite leadership (verse 23).

  Since Israel later had kings, what was wrong with Gideon's
becoming king? 1 Sam. 8:7.


   The tribes of Israel were supposed to be united by the Lord, who
dwelt in the tabernacle and raised up leaders like Joshua and Gideon.
But that plan required too much faith. The people wanted a person who
was more permanent, more powerful—someone to whom they could
pay taxes. They misread God's power. Instead of seeing God as deliv-
erer, they saw those whom He raised up as the key to freedom and
independence. God later let them have a king, but it was a concession
because of their lack of faith in Him (1 Samuel 8). After the disastrous
reign of Saul, the Lord made the best of kingship by choosing David,
"a man after his own heart" (1 Sam. 13:14), with whom He made a
special covenant (2 Samuel 7; Psalm 89). But the kings who descended
from David destroyed the spiritual life of the nation. The only hope
was a return to the Lord's leadership. He is the divine "root and the
offspring of David" (Rev. 22:16) to whom the kingdom rightfully
belongs (Gen. 49:10). His power does not originate in this world (John
18:36).

   Do you enjoy having power or influence over people? If so,
 why? Are the results positive or negative?

                                                                    57

GIDEON'S MISTAKE (Judg. 8:24-28).

   Just after nobly refusing to become king (Judg. 8:23), Gideon made
the biggest mistake of his career. He asked for earrings taken from the
Midianites (called Ishmaelites in verse 24; compare Gen. 37:25, 27,
28), and from this gold he made an "ephod," a priestly shoulder cape
or mantle (verses 24-27).

   Why did Gideon do this?

   Which of the following best answers the above question?
1. Gideon coveted the gold and realized that the Israelites could make
   him rich.
2. So that Gideon could have the gold and at the same time acknowl-
   edge the Lord's role in the deliverance, he made the gold into a
   sacred object dedicated to the Lord.
3. Since the Angel of the Lord had appeared to him at Ophrah (Judg.
   6:11-24), Gideon thought that he should establish a center of wor-
   ship there (Judg 8:27).
4. Gideon wanted to establish a worship center in his tribe of Manasseh
   to make sure that Manasseh would retain a leading political role.
5. Another answer:

6. All the above.

   What was wrong with what Gideon did, as recorded in Judges
8:24-27?


   By making an ephod containing a lot of gold, like the ephod worn
by the Israelite high priest (Exod. 28:6-14), Gideon intended to wor-
ship the Lord. But it was wrong for him to set up priestly worship
functions that the Lord had not authorized, in competition with the
sanctuary. Because the Lord was not present with Gideon's ephod, the
ephod itself came to represent God and be worshiped (Judg. 8:27).
Compare 1 Kings 12:25-33, which describes how Jeroboam set up
unauthorized golden calves at Bethel and Dan, in competition with the
temple in Jerusalem. It appears that these were supposed to represent
the Lord, who had brought the Israelites out of Egypt (1 Kings 12:28;
see Exod. 32:4, 5). But these material representations were, in fact,
idols. (See Exod. 20:4-6; Deut. 4:15-18.)

   Does our form of worship follow principles established by
 God? If not, how should we go about making changes?

INGRATITUDE (Judg. 8:29-35).

   When Gideon made a golden ephod, his intentions were probably
not too bad. But, whereas he had formerly followed God's direction,
on this occasion he trusted only in his own reasoning. The results were
disastrous, both for his family and for the nation.

  Why did the people turn so quickly to Baal worship as soon as
Gideon died? Judg. 8:33.


   Gideon's ephod was originally supposed to be used to worship the
Lord. But more and more importance was attached to the object itself,
so that it came to be worshiped. (Compare 2 Kings 18:4.) Once the
object was worshiped in place of the Lord Himself, the Lord was
forgotten. Then it was a fairly short step for the Israelites to reconnect
their worship with Baal, against whom Gideon (Jerubbaal) had con-
tended (Judg. 8:33-35; compare 6:25-32).

   Was there a connection between the fact that the Israelites did
not remember the Lord after Gideon's death and the ingratitude
that they showed to Gideon's family? Judg. 8:33-35.


    Deliverance from the Midianites was accomplished by the Lord,
working through Gideon. They were a team. When the people of Israel
ungratefully "did not remember the Lord their God" (Judg. 8:34,
NRSV) and the deliverances He had wrought for Israel, they simulta-
neously lost sight of the good that deliverers such as Gideon had done
to them. Thus, ironically, the apostasy into which Gideon led the
people contributed greatly to their subsequent lack of kindness to his
family.
    When Judges 8:34, NIV, says that the people "did not remember,"
it does not mean that they had amnesia for which they were not
responsible. They were, indeed, responsible for not remembering, that
is, not cherishing or guarding as precious the significance of what the
Lord had done for them. This meaning of the word remember also
appears in Exodus 20:8: "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy."
Compare the parallel statement of the same commandment in
Deuteronomy 5:12: "Observe [literally "guard" or "keep"] the Sabbath
day, to keep it holy" (NIV).

   Do we cherish the memory of what God and His people have
 done for us?


                                                                       59

EXPERIMENT WITH KINGSHIP (Judg. 9:1-22).

   Gideon said, "I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over
you" (Judg. 8:23, NRSV). But after Gideon died, Abimelech per-
suaded the citizens of Shechem to make him king.
   The name Abimelech, apparently given by Gideon (Judg. 8:31),
means "my father is king." This name probably referred to the divine
heavenly Father as king, in harmony with Gideon's words "the Lord
will rule over you" (verse 23, NRSV). But Abimelech ignored the
significance of his own name!

   Why did the citizens of Shechem support Abimelech? Judg.
9:1-6.


   Which of the following best answers the question?
1. Abimelech gave the impression, which may have had some basis in
   reality, that the 70 legitimate sons of Gideon were ruling over the
   people of Shechem. Abimelech would help to remove this undesir-
   able external authority (Judg. 9:2).
2. Gideon's other sons were born to wives who lived at Ophrah.
   Abimelech was born to a concubine from Shechem. Thus, he claimed
   to be a Shechemite.
3. Whereas Gideon and the people of Ophrah belonged to the tribe of
   Manasseh, the Israelites of Shechem were of the tribe of Ephraim.
   The proud Ephraimites had earlier chafed under Gideon's leader-
   ship (Judg. 8:1-3). Now they had an opportunity to become the
   dominant northern tribe by appointing as their leader a son of
   Gideon who was also from their territory.
4. Another answer:

5. All the above.

  What is the point of Jotham's parable, recorded in Judges 9:7-
20?


   Jotham's parable is both a searing commentary on the disloyalty
and treachery of Abimelech and the Shechemites (Judg. 9:1-6) and a
prophecy that they would destroy each other. (See verses 23-57.)

  What dangers are involved in manipulating others to achieve
our personal goals? How can we avoid hurting people in our
quest for success?

DEPRAVITY AND GRAVITY (Judg. 9:23-57).

   Abimelech ruled for three years (Judg. 9:22). But the Lord allowed
him and the Shechemites to destroy each other (verses 23-57), as
foreseen by Jotham (verse 20). The story demonstrates God's justice
in making punishment fit a crime. "What goes around comes around"
or "what goes up must come down." (See Judg. 9:57—"fall back on
their heads," NRSV.)
   Study the coincidences in this story. Where does coincidence cease
and divine intervention begin? What evidence is there that God was in
control of these "coincidences"?

Judg. 9:23, 24

Compare Judg. 9:23 with Judg. 7:22

Compare Judg. 9:26-29 with verses 1-3

Compare Judg. 9:32, 34 with verse 25

Compare Judg. 9:34, 43 with Judg. 7:16

Compare Judg. 9:48, 49 with verse 20

Compare Judg. 9:53 with verse 57

   Like his father, Abimelech was a courageous and effective military
leader (Judg. 9:34-49). But his story shows what tragedy can result
when (1) people are disloyal and ungrateful to God and to one another,
(2) actions are guided by ruthless human ambition rather than by God
and His principles, and (3) a leader is chosen for the wrong reasons.
   Abimelech was the "bramble" Jotham depicted him to be (Judg.
9:14, 15). An illegitimate son, he was an illegitimate king as far as God
was concerned. The first legitimate king of Israel was Saul, whom God
rejected because of his disobedience. Like Saul, Abimelech was af-
flicted by an "evil spirit" from God (Judg. 9:23; compare 1 Sam.
16:14). Also like Saul, Abimelech asked his armor-bearer to kill him
when he was mortally wounded. Abimelech's armor-bearer complied,
but Saul's did not (Judg. 9:54; compare 1 Sam. 31:4).

    Can you find other biblical examples of punishments fitting
 crimes? (See Gen. 4:10-12; Num. 14:26-35.) How have you seen
 God's justice at work during your lifetime? Why are some wrongs
 not paid for in this life?


                                                                     6I

FURTHER STUDY: On God's ultimate punishment of the wicked at
the end of time, read: 2 Thess. 1:7-10; Rev. 20:7-10, 14, 15. Read
Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, "The Earlier Judges,"             I
pp. 555-557.

   "God had manifested special favor to Gideon, in selecting him as
the instrument through whom to deliver Israel. While great responsi-
bilities rested upon him in this important crisis, Gideon's course was
marked with humility and faithful obedience. God accepted his work,
and crowned his efforts with success. But now Gideon was assailed by
temptation in a new form. When the reprover of wrong has done his
work, in obedience to God's commands, the period of inactivity which
succeeds the struggle, is often the most dangerous. This danger Gideon
now experienced. A spirit of unrest was upon him. Hitherto he had
been content to execute the commands given him of God; but now,
instead of calmly waiting for divine instruction, he began to devise and
execute plans for himself."—Ellen G. White, Signs of the Times, July
28, 1881.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. The above quotation refers to the danger of periods of
     inactivity following struggles. Have you found this to be
     true? (Compare 2 Sam. 7:1; 11:1-3.) Explain your answer.

   2. Consider how this lesson can be used to illustrate the con-
      trast between the kingship of sin in our lives and the rulership
      of Christ and His righteousness. (See Rom. 6:14-22; Col.
      1:13, 14.)

   3. What does gratitude do to relationships? How do you feel
      when someone expresses gratitude to you, or fails to do so?
      Do you express gratitude to other people and to God as
      much as you could?

   4. Do you see a connection between a person's loyalty to God
      and his or her loyalty to other human beings? (See Ruth
      1:16, 17.) What are the implications of this idea for your
      relationships with others, especially if you are married?

SUMMARY: Gideon was loyal to God when he refused royal honors,
but he was disloyal when he set up unauthorized worship. This disloy-
alty led many Israelites astray, preparing the way for worship of other
gods and for disloyalty to his own family. The story of Gideon's son
Abimelech illustrates the self-destructiveness of disregard for proper
relationships with God and other people.

            As Rupelin Gorospe and her three children boarded the air-
        craft, she turned to those who stood watching. "I will return and
        carry on the work that my husband and I started," she promised.
            Rupelin and Art Gorospe had served as nurses in a remote
        clinic in Ethiopia before they transferred to Ethiopian Adventist
        College to serve the medical needs of students and staff. The
        hours at the clinic were long; they needed time to relax.
            The couple loaded their camping gear and their family into the
        little car and drove out of town. As the car turned off the main
        road, a man with a gun blocked their way. He raised the gun and
        began firing into the car. Art and the family's maid died instantly.
        The gunman fired again, but did not hit Rupelin and the children.
            Anger and rage filled the hearts of friends and co-workers

        two innocent people, and got only the family's picnic lunch.
            Rupelin went to the police, not to demand justice, but to plead
        for the life of the killer. "Please, when you find this man, spare
        his life. Tell him I forgive him." The killer, a man named Kabato,
        was eventually arrested, and sent to prison. A friend of Art Gorospe,
        fellow missionary Chris Howell, visited Kabato and told him of
        Rupelin's plea for his life. Howell studied with Kabato, who
        eventually accepted Jesus as his Saviour and was baptized.
            After several weeks of mourning in the Philippines, Rupelin
        Gorospe returned to her duties as the college nurse, meeting the
        medical needs of the sick in the community as well as the college.
            Life is hard in the college community. Two years ago another
        teacher was murdered. Recently angry people from the commu-
        nity attempted to burn the house of the college treasurer.
            But Rupelin is a courageous young woman; she is staying on.
        The people need her help. Hers is the spirit that will carry the
        gospel to the world in spite of challenges and difficulties.
                                                 Pray earnestly for the mis-
                                             sionaries like Rupelin who min-
                                             ister for Jesus on the front lines.

                                                Rupelin Gorospe and her
                                              children have returned to
                                              Ethiopia to serve God and the
                                              people there.

  Repentance and Rashness




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Judg. 10:6-12:7.

   MEMORY TEXT: "So they put away the foreign gods from
   among them and worshiped the Lord; and he could no longer
   bear to see Israel suffer" (Judges 10:16, NRSV).

    KEY THOUGHT: When God's people repent and return to His
covenant, He can provide for them as He has wanted to do all along.
Zeal for God's cause is an inspiring and motivating force, but rashness
is destructive.

    PROMISES, PROMISES. A father promises his son an outing
but does not mark the promise in his appointment book. Responsibil-
ities come up. The father forgets his promise. But the son does not.
    A bride vows to "love, honor, and cherish" until death. But down
deep, she knows that if things don't go as well as she hopes, she can be
divorced and marry someone else.
    While he is partying, a king promises with an oath to give his
daughter whatever she wishes. Prompted by her mother, she asks for
the head of a preacher on a platter. "The king was distressed, but
because of his oaths and his dinner guests, he ordered that her request
be granted and had John beheaded in the prison" (Matt. 14:9, 10,
NIV).
    Promises are a problem! We are in trouble if we don't keep them,
but sometimes we are also in trouble if we do keep them. Making a
rash promise, which should not have been made in the first place, can
result in a no-win situation. This was the predicament in which Jephthah
found himself. He vowed, but it never occurred to him that his daughter's
future was at stake!

REPENTANCE (Judg. 10:6-16).

   They did it again! The Israelites forsook the Lord. Their worship
turned into a veritable United Nations of pagan gods from Syria,
Sidon, Moab, Ammon, and Philistia (Judg. 10:6). So the Lord "sold
them" into the power of the Philistines and the Ammonites (verse 7,
NRSV).

  Why do you think the Lord permitted the Philistines and Am-
monites to oppress Israel?


   Which of the following best answers the question?
1. The Philistines were from the west, and the Ammonites were from
   the east, so the Israelites would get a double dose of oppression,
   from both sides.
2. Allowing the Israelites to suffer at the hands of the Philistines and
   Ammonites, whose gods they worshiped, is another example of the
   Lord's tailoring punishment to fit a crime.
3. By this means, the Lord could make the gods of the Philistines and
   Ammonites odious to the Israelites.
4. Another answer:

5. All the above.

   In Judges 10:10-16, the Lord directly confronts the Israelites
with their apostasy. Compare this with earlier passages that are
similar: Judg. 2:1-5; 6:7-10. What similarities and differences do
you notice regarding (1) the identity of the one speaking to the
people, (2) the indictment, referring to past history and present
disloyalty, (3) opportunity for hope (or lack of it), and (4) the
reaction of the people?


   In Judges 10:14, the Lord made it clear that because the people had
abandoned Him, He had justly abandoned them: "Go and cry to the
gods whom you have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your
distress" (NRSV). But the people did not give up. They fully admitted
their guilt and the right of God to punish them (verse 15). And they did
something to demonstrate their sincerity: They rid themselves of their
foreign gods and began to serve the Lord. Because they had responded
positively, the Lord was able to help them (verse 16).

   How can you rid yourself of those things that stand between
 you and the Lord?

                                                                     65

JEPHTHAH (Judg. 10:17-11:11).

   After the Israelites had turned again to the Lord, the Ammonite
oppressors showed up again. The Israelites were now looking for a
deliverer to lead the battle. Who could do it? The book of Judges
leaves that question hanging and moves on to some apparently unre-
lated background information regarding Jephthah (Judg. 11:1-3). But
when the Ammonite threat is mentioned again, it becomes clear that
Jephthah is to be the deliverer (verses 4-11).

   Jephthah was an illegitimate son of a prostitute (Judg. 11:1).
How did circumstances arising from this social handicap result in
his being chosen as leader? Judg. 11:2, 3.


   Like Ehud, who was left-handed (Judg. 3:15), and Gideon, who was
the least important member of the weakest clan in Manasseh (Judg.
6:15), Jephthah had what would have been regarded as a disadvantage.
But this resulted in his having an advantage, as was also true in the
case of Ehud (Judg. 3:16, 21).
   The legitimate sons of Jephthah's father forced him into exile so
that they could keep any share he may have had in his father's inherit-
ance (Judg. 11:2). Fending for himself in the land of Tob, he became a
leader of a raiding party (verse 3). Thus, when an experienced military
leader was needed for the impending battle against the Ammonites,
Jephthah was the logical candidate (verses 4-6).

   How did the elders of Gilead persuade Jephthah to lead the
Israelites into battle? Judg. 11:6-11.


   Jephthah had been exiled from Gilead, so he was not prepared to
risk his life on behalf of the Gileadites without a substantial reward
(Judg. 11:7). So they offered not only to make him leader of an army to
fight the Ammonites (verse 6); they also promised to make him the
administrative chief of their territory (verse 8). He agreed to those
terms and made a covenant with them, which was solemnized before
the Lord at Mizpah (verses 9-11), where the Israelites had gathered
(Judg. 10:17).

    Consider other Bible characters for whom God turned disad-
 vantages into advantages. In what ways has God done this for
 you? Reviewing your experience, why do you think the Lord
 blessed you in this manner?

WORDS BEFORE WAR (Judg. 11:12-27).

   Rather than immediately rushing into battle, Jephthah tried to avoid
war through diplomacy. The Ammonite king argued that when the
Israelites came out of Egypt, they took the land between the Arnon and
Jabbok rivers from the Ammonites. He demanded it back.

  What elements of truth and inaccuracy were contained in the
demand of the king of Ammon? Judg. 11:13-22; Num. 21:21-30.


   The Israelites had taken this territory from Sihon, king of the
Amorites, who had earlier taken it from Moab (Num. 21:21-30). It
appears that in the time of Jephthah, the Ammonite king claimed to
represent Moab. The Moabites had been weakened by their defeat at
the hands of Ehud and his fellow Israelites (Judg. 3:28-30), so perhaps
for a time they were allied to the Ammonites, who were related to them
through Lot, the nephew of Abraham (Gen. 19:36-38).
   Even if the Ammonite king could legitimately represent the Moabites,
who at one time had owned the land, Jephthah argued that the Israel-
ites had taken it from Sihon, king of the Amorites, not from the
Ammonites (Judg. 11:14-23).

  What did Jephthah mean by saying, "Should you not possess
what your god Chemosh gives you to possess? And should we not
be the ones to possess everything that the Lord our God has
conquered for our benefit" (Judg. 11:24, NRSV)?


   There was no United Nations to arbitrate such disputes, so Jephthah
appealed to divine justice (verse 27) in accordance with the principle
that God had established the boundaries of the Israelites in relation to
other nations (Deut. 32:8). When they came out of Egypt, God had
guided them by that principle when He forbade them to fight against
their relatives, the Moabites and Ammonites (Deut. 2:9, 19).
   Jephthah may or may not have understood the sovereignty of God
over all nations, but in any case, he stated his case in a way that the
foreign ruler could understand. Chemosh was the god of the Moabites
(Num. 21:29), so Jephthah was addressing the Ammonite king as the
ruler of Moab.

    What efforts does Satan continually make to reclaim "terri-
 tory" in our lives that has been taken over by the Holy Spirit?
 What is the answer to Satan's claims?


                                                                    67

VOW FOR VICTORY (Judg. 11:28-40).

   Since the Ammonite king did not accept Jephthah's reasoning,
Jephthah went into action, motivated by the Spirit of the Lord. Like
Gideon, he attacked the enemy before they attacked him.

   Why did Jephthah make the vow that he did? Judg. 11:30, 31.


   Jephthah valued the security of promises made before God. Perhaps
his unstable background had made him particularly sensitive to human
unreliability and the need for security that only God could provide. In
any case, his willingness to lead the Israelites had been based upon
promises witnessed by the Lord (Judg. 11:10, 11).
   Jephthah felt a need for security. Rather than seeking signs, he
vowed that if the Lord would give him victory, he would offer as a
burnt offering whoever or whatever should meet him when he returned
home.

   What was the result of his vow? Judg. 11:34-40.


   To his dismay, Jephthah was met by his only child, a daughter. God
had fulfilled his condition by giving him victory. Now he felt obligated
to fulfill his vow. Heroically, his daughter did not protest (compare
Gen. 22:9), but she asked to live for two more months. Then, he "did
with her according to the vow he had made" (Judg. 11:39, NRSV). At
this point, perhaps out of a sense of horror, the biblical text avoids
stating directly what happened: he offered her as a burnt offering
(verse 31). This does not mean, of course, that he burned her alive; he
would have slain her with a knife first. (Compare Gen. 22:10.)
   What went wrong? The Lord was already with Jephthah. He did not
need to make his rash vow; God would have given him victory any-
way. The vow showed insufficient faith. Furthermore, once the vow
was made and the daughter designated, Jephthah should have offered
an animal as a substitute, just as Abraham offered in place of Isaac a
ram provided by the Lord (Gen. 22:13, 14). God did not demand or
approve of human sacrifice (Deut. 12:31), which was practiced by
Jephthah's enemies, the Ammonites (Lev. 18:21; compare 1 Kings
11:7) and Moabites (2 Kings 3:26, 27).

    When is an oath rash, and when is it a commitment to display
 the victories faith has wrought in our lives? Matt. 5:33-37.

FRIENDS WHO BECAME ENEMIES (Judg. 12:1-7).

   Just as the Ephraimites had given Gideon trouble after he defeated
the Midianites (Judg. 8:1), so a later generation of these fellow Israel-
ites harassed Jephthah after he defeated the Ammonites.

   Compare the trouble the Ephraimites gave Gideon and the
trouble they gave Jephthah. What similarities and what differ-
ences do you see between the two situations?


   In both situations, "the tribe of Ephraim is presented in an unfavor-
able light. They were passive in time of oppression, and arrogant when
others had taken the initiative and won the victory."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 2, p. 379. Whereas the Ephraimites answered Gideon's
call once the Midianites were on the run (Judg. 7:24, 25), they did not
help Jephthah at all (12:2). The Ephraimites disputed with Gideon
(8:1), but they assembled their troops against Jephthah (12:1). The
Ephraimites backed off when Gideon spoke to them (8:3), but they
taunted Jephthah (12:4).

   Why did Jephthah fight? Judg. 12:4-6.


   Which of the following best answers the above question?
1. The provocation was too severe to go unpunished.
2. Jephthah had just suffered an intense personal tragedy owing to his
   vow regarding his daughter. Aside from losing her, which was
   terrible enough, he would be deprived of descendants. His toler-
   ance for nonsense from the Ephraimites would be at an all-time low.
3. Since the Ephraimites were about to attack him and his fellow
   Gileadites, Jephthah led an effective defense.
4. Another answer:

5. All the above.

   Civil war! The book of Judges begins with Israelite tribes cooperat-
ing together (Judg. 1:1-3, 22, NRSV—"house of Joseph" = Ephraim
and Manasseh). They also cooperated under Barak (Judg. 5:14, 15, 18)
and Gideon (Judg. 7:23-25). But intertribal problems grew from apa-
thy (Judg. 5:15-17) to contention (Judg. 8:1-3) and finally, to war
(Judg. 12:1-6). The Israelites had become their own enemies!

   How can we avoid strife among ourselves?


                                                                      69
Friday                                                      May 24
FURTHER STUDY: On the topic of respect for oaths, read Joshua 9,
describing the circumstances surrounding a treaty that the Israelites
made with the Gibeonites. Read Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets,
"The Earlier Judges," pp. 557-559.

   "The Gibeonites had pledged themselves to renounce idolatry, and
accept the worship of Jehovah; and the preservation of their lives was
not a violation of God's command to destroy the idolatrous Canaanites.
Hence the Hebrews had not by their oath pledged themselves to com-
mit sin. And though the oath had been secured by deception, it was not
to be disregarded. The obligation to which one's word is pledged—if it
does not bind him to perform a wrong act—should be held sacred. No
consideration of gain, of revenge, or of self-interest, can in any way
affect the inviolability of an oath or pledge. 'Lying lips are abomina-
tion to the Lord.' Proverbs 12:22. He that 'shall ascend into the hill of
the Lord,' and 'stand in His holy place,' is 'he that sweareth to his own
hurt, and changeth not.' Psalms 24:3; 15:4."—Patriarchs and
Prophets, p. 506.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What are the implications of the above statement (espe-
     cially "if it does not bind him to perform a wrong act") for
     Jephthah's decision to sacrifice his daughter (Judg. 11:35)?

   2. Do "moral dilemmas" really exist? In other words, is it ever
      true that keeping one of God's requirements necessarily
      results in breaking another of His requirements?

   3. Do you keep your promises faithfully? What is the differ-
      ence between ordinary promises on the one hand and vows,
      oaths, or pledges on the other hand?

   4. What issues regarding vows are addressed in Numbers 30?

SUMMARY: When the Israelites turned again to God, putting away
those things that came between themselves and Him, He forgave them
and mercifully turned again to help them. To deliver them from the
Ammonites, God raised up Jephthah as their leader. Jephthah was
zealous for the Lord, but at a highly stressful time, he sought assurance
from God in an unwise way, which was not consistent with faith. Rash
vows that dishonor God should not be kept.

          Night after night Louis attended the evangelistic meetings in
       Mexico City alone. He seemed intensely interested in the topics on
       the home that were presented each evening. One night after the
       meeting, he stopped me. "I wish I had known what you are present-
       ing before I got married, and now I don't know if it is possible to
       save our marriage. But I would like you to talk with my wife," he
       pleaded. I usually do not counsel someone who has not come to me
       for help, and she had not attended the meetings, so I felt I had little
       influence over her. But the pastor and I went to visit Louis' wife,
       and she agreed to talk with me. She was a fragile soul, wounded by
       misunderstanding, jealousy, and mistrust. This was her second
       marriage; the first one failed because of her husband's infidelity.
       Louis did not realize the trauma she had suffered in her first
       marriage and did not know how to treat her tenderly.
          As we talked, tears flowed down her face, but after the storm of
       emotions, she began to realize that with Jesus, there was hope for
       their marriage. Mariela was willing to talk with her husband and
       receive marriage counseling. The next day Louis and Mariela came
       together to talk. The atmosphere was full of sincerity, recognition
       and acceptance. The couple asked pardon of each other, held hands,
       embraced, and finally decided to stop the divorce process.
           Louis had attended a church but had never surrendered his life
       to the Lord. Mariela had been a Christian, but had abandoned her
       faith long ago. I explained the importance of inviting Jesus into the
       home. But Mariela was reluctant to be rebaptized.
           Louis and Mariela began coming to the meetings together. They
       looked like a newly married couple. On Sabbath Louis stood to
        request baptism, and to his surprise and ours, Mariela suddenly
       appeared beside him; they were baptized together. Following their
       baptism Louis and Mariela reconsecrated their marriage to God at
                                the close of the series of meetings. Louis
                                and Mariela are good examples of what
                                Jesus can do to create a happy home!

Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Judges 13.

   MEMORY TEXT: "And the Angel of the Lord appeared to the
   woman and said to her, 'Indeed now, you are barren and have
   borne no children, but you shall conceive and bear a son' "
   (Judges 13:3, NKJV).

  KEY THOUGHT: Samson was a special deliverer, whom God
chose before his birth. All who are privileged to be chosen by God
have a responsibility to live holy lives.

   CHILD OF PROMISE. Infertility is a major problem today. Many
couples spend thousands of dollars on medical procedures that in-
crease their chances of having children. In many cases, of course,
success by such means is not guaranteed.
   In ancient times, couples were just as anxious to have children, but
modern technology was not available to them. The kind of stress that
could result from infertility is apparent in this exchange between
Rachel and Jacob: Rachel "said to Jacob, 'Give me children, or I'll
die!' Jacob became angry with her and said, 'Am I in the place of God,
who has kept you from having children?' " (Gen. 30:1, 2, NIV).
   Why did God allow Rachel to be childless? So that when she did
have a child, she would recognize him to be a special gift from the
Lord (Gen. 30:22, 23). Earlier, God had taught the same lesson to
Sarah (Gen. 18:9-14; 21:1-7) and Rebekah (Gen. 25:21).
   In the time of the "judges," Mrs. Manoah was infertile. But the Lord
gave her a child who would grow up to become big and strong. Yes,
strong indeed!

MIRACLE CHILD (Judg. 13:1-5).

   After the short career of Jephthah (Judg. 12:7), followed by three
minor judges (verses 8-15), the Israelites turned from God again. So
He gave them to the Philistines for a long time: 40 years (Judg. 13:1).
   There is no indication that the Israelites were repentant at this time.
Neither was there a living deliverer. But in His great mercy, God had
not given up on the Israelites. So He raised up a deliverer, giving him
as a baby to faithful parents. Like the wives of the patriarchs (Sarah,
Rebekah, and Rachel), the wife of Manoah had been infertile. Thus,
the baby announced was a miracle child, a special gift from God.

  What similarities were there between the circumstances of
Samson's conception and birth and those surrounding special cases
mentioned in the New Testament?

Luke 1:5-22

Luke 1:26-38

    With regard to the circumstances of his birth, Samson had some
illustrious company: Isaac, John the Baptist, and Jesus Christ. The
mothers of Isaac and John the Baptist were beyond childbearing age
(Gen. 18:11; Luke 1:7, 36, 37), and the mother of Jesus was a virgin
(Luke 1:27, 34, 35).
    The earlier judges decisively subdued Israel's enemies (Judg. 3:30;
4:23, 24). But the Angel of the Lord predicted that Samson would only
begin to deliver Israel from the Philistines (Judg. 13:5).

   Why would Samson only begin to deliver Israel?


   Choose the best answer to the above question:
1. Because of the poor spiritual condition of the Israelites, God could
   do only a limited work for them.
2. Samson would carry on a personal struggle with the Philistines
   rather than leading an army against them.
3. The Philistines were an especially tough enemy.
4. Samson's life would fall short of God's ideal for him.
5. Another answer:

6. All the above.

   Why should every child be valued as a gift from God? (See Ps.
127:3-5.)

NAZIRITE (Judg. 13:4, 5, 7, 13, 14).

   Before his birth, Samson was designated by the Lord as a Nazirite,
that is, a person dedicated or "separated" to God. As a physical sign of
this dedication, he was never to have a haircut (Judg. 13:5). His
mother was not to drink "wine or strong drink" or eat unclean meat
(verses 4, 7, 14).

  What was the relationship between Nazirites and priests, who
were also dedicated to God? Numbers 6; compare Lev. 10:6-9;
21:1-15.


   While only priests were permitted to officiate in the sanctuary, any
Israelite could consecrate himself to the Lord by becoming a Nazirite.
Numbers 6 regulates Nazirites, whether men or women, who voluntar-
ily dedicated themselves to God for limited periods of time. During a
time of dedication, a Nazirite was to indicate outwardly his or her
special, holy relationship with the Lord (verse 8) by abstaining from
(1) wine, "strong drink," and all grape products (Num. 6:3, 4), (2)
haircuts (verse 5), and (3) corpse contamination (verses 6, 7).
   The restrictions for Nazirites were similar to those for priests, who
were also holy to the Lord. Priests were forbidden to drink wine or
strong drink when they went into the sanctuary (Lev. 10:9), and they
were restricted with regard to corpse contamination. Nazirites were
like the high priest, who was forbidden to defile himself even for his
closest relatives (Lev. 21:11). Priests were allowed haircuts, but they
were forbidden to let their hair hang loose in mourning for the dead
(Lev. 10:6; 21:10).
   Samson, Samuel, and John the Baptist were lifelong Nazirites.
Samson and John the Baptist were designated as such by the Lord
(Judg. 13:5; Luke 1:15). Samuel, who was born to a barren mother in
response to her prayer of faith, was dedicated to God by her (1 Sam.
1:11, 28). It appears that lifelong Nazirites were not prohibited from
contact with corpses. In fact, on several occasions Samson came in
contact with dead Philistines whom he had killed. (See, for example,
Judg. 15:15.) However, Samson and Samuel were prohibited from
having their hair cut (Judg. 13:5; 1 Sam. 1:11). John the Baptist was
not to drink wine or strong drink (Luke 1:15).

    Have you dedicated your life to God in a special way? What
 connection does your lifestyle have to your inner commitment?
 Do you think that the Christian lifestyle should be in all respects
 identical for all believers?

RESPONSIBLE PARENTS (Judg. 13:2-14).

   The name of Manoah's wife is not given, but it was to her that the
Angel of the Lord appeared (Judg. 13:3). When Manoah prayed that
the Lord would send the Angel to them again, He appeared a second
time to the woman, who then brought her husband to talk to Him
(verses 9-11).

   Why did the Angel appear primarily to Manoah's wife, rather
than to Manoah? Judg. 13:3, 9.


   Which of the following best answers the above question?
1. Manoah's wife had been infertile (verse 2). She needed special
   evidence to believe that she would have a child. (Compare Gen.
   18:12—Sarah laughed.)
2. Manoah's wife would nourish the baby during pregnancy. Also,
   after his birth and before he would be weaned, she was responsible
   for observing dietary restrictions in keeping with his Nazirite status
   (Judg. 13:4, 7, 14).
3. It appears that Manoah's wife was more perceptive than her hus-
   band regarding the Lord and the way He deals with human beings
   (Judg. 13:22, 23).
4. Another answer:

5. All the above.

  How seriously did Manoah and his wife take the words of the
Angel? Judg. 13:6-12.


    Manoah's words make it clear that he believed the message of the
Angel of the Lord as related by his wife. Unlike Zecharias, the father
of John the Baptist, he did not ask for confirmation of the prediction
that he would have a son (compare Luke 1:18), but rather for further
instruction regarding the child's life and mission (Judg. 13:8, 12).
   Manoah and his wife took their responsibility seriously, and God
answered Manoah's prayer for guidance (verses 8, 9). But when the
Angel of the Lord returned and spoke to Manoah directly, He reiter-
ated the dietary guidelines that He had stated earlier (verses 13, 14).

    Do we take seriously enough our responsibility to safeguard
 the physical, moral, and spiritual well-being of our children? Do
 we ask God for counsel in these matters? What is so important
 about diet? How do prenatal factors affect children?

                                                                     75

HIS NAME IS WONDERFUL (Judg. 13:15-23).

  How did Manoah's wife describe the Angel of the Lord to her
husband? Judg. 13:6.


   Manoah and his wife did not know that the man they saw (verses 6,
10, 11) was "the angel of the Lord" (verse 16). Like Gideon, they
offered Him food. (Compare Judg. 6:19.) The Angel said that He
would not eat the food, but they could offer a burnt offering to the
Lord (Judg. 13:16).
   With aroused curiosity, Manoah asked the Angel who He was
(verse 17). Without stating His name, the Angel described His name as
"wonderful" (verse 18, NRSV). The word translated "wonderful" here
means something like "beyond human understanding." (Compare Ps.
139:6; see also NIV of Judg. 13:18.)
   When Manoah offered a burnt offering and cereal offering to the
Lord, the Angel ascended in the flame (Judg. 13:20). Manoah and his
wife now understood the man to be "the angel of the Lord," that is,
"God," "the Lord" (verses 21-23). Like Gideon, Manoah was afraid.
(Compare Judg. 6:22.) Whereas the Lord had reassured Gideon (verse
23), it was Manoah's wife who reassured Manoah on the basis of the
Angel's favorable treatment of them (Judg. 13:23).
   In an earlier lesson (lesson 5, Tuesday, on Judg. 6:11-16), we
identified "the angel of the Lord" with Christ. Further support for this
identification can be found by comparing the description of the Angel's
name as "wonderful" (Judg. 13:18) with the description of the Messiah
in Isaiah 9:6: "For a child has been born for us, a son given to us;
authority rests upon his shoulders; and he is named Wonderful Coun-
selor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace" (NRSV). The
word translated "wonderful" here means literally "wonder" (wonder or
marvel of a counselor). This noun is from the same Hebrew root as the
adjective "wonderful" in Judges 13:18.
   An important aspect of the Lord's "wonderfulness" is the fact that
He performs wonders of deliverance on behalf of His people (Exod.
15:11; Ps. 77:14). The wonder that He performed before Manoah and
his wife (Judg. 13:19, 20) by ascending in the flame of the burnt-
offering sacrifice (verse 20) pointed forward with amazing clarity to
His greatest act of deliverance: the wondrous sacrifice of Himself on
behalf of human beings (see John 1:29; compare John 20:17—"I have
not yet ascended to the Father").

   Describe your feelings of awe when you contemplate what the
 Lord has done and is continuing to do for His people.

SAMSON (Judg. 13:24, 25).

   God had high hopes for Samson, as shown by the marvelous way in
which He had announced his birth. As the boy grew, the Lord blessed
him, and when he was still young, "the Spirit of the Lord began to stir
[impel] him" (Judg. 13:25, NIV; compare Luke 1:15, 80; Luke 2:52).

  What did God want to do with Samson? Did he Ike up to the
Lord's ideal for his life? Judg. 13:5.


   Which of the following best answers the above question?
1. In spite of his failures, Samson did fulfill the prediction that he
   would begin to deliver Israel from the Philistines (Judg. 13:5;
   compare Judg. 16:30, 31). It is not clear, however, whether the
   prediction expressed the full extent of God's ideal or reflected the
   reality of what God could do with him, given constraints imposed
   by Samson's own failures.
2. If he had lived a life of wholehearted devotion to God, Samson
   could have eliminated the Philistine threat.
3. Had Samson been a spiritual man, in keeping with his special
   dedication to God, he could have been a great religious leader like
   Joshua, Samuel, and David. He could have led the Israelites to
   repentance and reformation, to love and respect the One whose
   name and works are wonderful (Judg. 13:18, 19).
4. Another answer:

5. All the above.

   Who were the Philistines, and who finally delivered Israel from
them? 2 Sam. 5:17-25; 8:1.


   The Philistines were a problem to the Israelites before the time of
Samson (Judg. 3:31; 10:7) and continued to cause serious trouble until
David overcame them. "They were, like the Hebrews, invaders and
settlers in Palestine. Philistines, in limited numbers, were in the land as
early as the time of Abraham (Gen. 21:32). But their major wave of
migration into Palestine probably occurred at the beginning of the 12th
century B.C. along with that of other non-Semitic tribes from Asia
Minor and the Aegean Islands."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2,
p. 382.

   What is your part in avoiding Samson's failure and allowing
 God to achieve His ideal for your life?

                                                                       77

FURTHER STUDY: Read Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets,
"Samson," pp. 560-562.

   "He who will observe simplicity in all his habits, restricting the
appetite and controlling the passions, may preserve his mental powers
strong, active, and vigorous, quick to perceive everything which de-
mands thought or action, keen to discriminate between the holy and the
unholy, and ready to engage in every enterprise for the glory of God
and the benefit of humanity."—Ellen G. White, Signs of the Times,
September 29, 1881.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. The Angel of the Lord called Samson through his parents.
     Study the relationships between the various times and ways
     in which God communicated with His people during the
     period of the "judges":
     a. Angel of the Lord rebukes (Judg. 2:1-5).
     b. prophetess called (Judg. 4:4-7).
     c. prophet rebukes (Judg. 6:7-10).
     d. Angel of the Lord calls (Judg. 6:11-16).
     e. Lord rebukes (Judg. 10:10-16).
     f. Angel of the Lord calls (Judges 13).

   2. What is the relationship between holiness and effectiveness
      in service for Christ? If Samson had been genuinely holy by
      virtue of fellowship with God, what difference would there
      have been in his effectiveness?

   3. Why was David ultimately more successful in subduing the
      Philistines than was Samson? Are solitary champions or
      group leaders more effective in God's work today?

SUMMARY: Samson was a miracle child, announced by the "won-
derful" Angel of the Lord Himself and born to a barren mother. His
entire life, even before birth, was to be holy, dedicated to God. His
mission was to begin delivering Israel from the Philistines. God chooses
leaders whom He has carefully trained for the particular challenges
with which they will be confronted.

                                 James H. Zachary

           Young Lica had problems. His father was a drunkard. His
        mother lived a life of sin. Lica soon became a problem boy in his
        village. Then one day a young Christian couple invited him to
        attend a Revelation Seminar, and his life began to change.
           Lica made the long trip from his village to Pitesti, a city in
        Romania, to attend the seminar. His heart thrilled as he studied
        the Bible and began to realize that Jesus loved him. Week after
        week he traveled to Pitesti to hear more of Jesus. He longed to
        share this message with the people in his own village.
            He visited the village mayor. "I would like to use the town hall
        to hold a Revelation Seminar," he said. But the mayor refused to
        rent the building to someone who wanted to give Bible studies.
        The high school principal also refused to rent a classroom.
           The only other building large enough for a Revelation Seminar
        was the town's saloon. He went to talk to the man who owned the
        saloon, a man affectionately known as Uncle Elijah. "Uncle, I
        would like to rent your saloon for a Revelation Seminar."
            "What is that"" Elijah asked.
            "It is a meeting where many people can come to study the book
        of Revelation." Elijah caught the phrase "many people." Perhaps
        this was a way to increase business, he thought. He gladly agreed.
            Eagerly Lica found the pastor. "I have rented a hall. I will invite
        the people. Please come and teach a Revelation Seminar in my
        village." Pastor Titi Gadea was delighted.
            On the evening of the first meeting, Uncle Elijah set up extra
        chairs in his saloon. As the people arrived, he stood behind the
        counter, ready to dispense drinks. And many people came to the
        meeting in the saloon. While he waited to take orders, Uncle
                                      Elijah listened to the interesting semi-
                                      nar. But no one bought drinks.
                                                                   (continued)

                                        Lica's life changed when h
                                      found Jesus Christ.

           The Ungolden Rule




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Judges 14 and 15.

   MEMORY TEXT: "And what more shall I say? For the time
   would fail me to tell of Gideon and Barak and Samson and
   Jephthah, also of David and Samuel and the prophets: who
   through faith subdued kingdoms, worked righteousness, ob-
   tained promises, stopped the mouths of lions" (Heb. 11:32, 33,
   NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Even though Samson's life was far from exem-
plary, God overruled human attitudes and circumstances in order to
carry out His will, the deliverance of His people.

    SECOND STRIKE. "He hit me first!" "No! He hit me first—
purposely!" Sound familiar? The underlying assumption is that hitting
is justifiable if it is done in retaliation. This logic is appealing not only
to children but to adults and entire nations, as well. A military strike or
war is "just" if it responds to provocation by the other side. Of course,
the other side is sure that it was also provoked. Resulting cycles of
aggression can go on for years, or even centuries, causing untold
suffering.
    Jesus said: "Do not resist an evildoer. But if anyone strikes you on
the right cheek, turn the other also" (Matt. 5:39, NRSV; compare
verse 44). Love and forgiveness break cycles of aggression caused by
hatred.
    Why did Samson not turn the other cheek to the Philistines? The
situation was special in that the Lord had commissioned Samson to
carry out His judgments upon the enemies of His people. Because
these enemies had filled up the cup of their iniquity, the Lord brought
retribution upon them.

PROVIDENTIAL PROVOCATION (Judg. 14:1-4).

   "Once Samson went down to Timnah, and at Timnah he saw a
Philistine woman" (Judg. 14:1, NRSV). Thus his troubles began. Eve
had a similar experience: "The woman saw that the tree was good for
food, and that it was a delight to the eyes" (Gen. 3:6, NRSV). Liking
what she saw, and trusting her own perceptions, Eve made a foolish
decision. Samson's parents tried to keep him from an unwise decision,
but to no avail.

   On what basis did Samson's parents try to persuade him to
reconsider? Judg. 14:3; compare Exod. 34:16; Deut. 7:3.

   Because of the danger of falling into idolatry, the Israelites were
expressly forbidden to intermarry with the idolatrous inhabitants of the
land (Deut. 7:3, 4). Before this command was given to Israel, Abraham
and Isaac recognized the importance of not taking wives from among
the inhabitants of Canaan (Gen. 24:3; compare 27:46-28:5).
   In spite of God's command, examples from the lives of the patri-
archs, and the wishes of his parents, Samson wanted a Philistine girl.
He was supposed to be dedicated to God for life as a holy person,
which gave him all the more responsibility to choose a wife of whom
God could approve. (Compare Lev. 21:7, regulating marriages of
priests.)

   What is meant in Judges 14:4 by the words: "His father and
mother did not know that this was from the Lord; for he was
seeking a pretext to act against the Philistines" (NRSV)?


   Did the Lord really want Samson to break His own command
regarding marrying non-Israelite women? Before we try to answer that
question, let's ask another one: Did the Lord want Joseph's brothers to
sell him into slavery (Gen. 37:25-28)? But see how Joseph later inter-
preted the event to his brothers: "And now do not be distressed, or
angry with yourselves, because you sold me here; for God sent me
before you to preserve life" (Gen. 45:5, NRSV; compare 50:20). So
the Lord even uses human mistakes to accomplish His purposes. (Compare
Rom. 8:28.)

   Have you seen human mistakes overruled by God? Are there
 aspects of God's overruling providence that you will never
 understand in this life? How can we reconcile ourselves to
 hurtful experiences that the Lord has permitted?


                                                                     81

A MARRIAGE RIDDLED WITH PROBLEMS (Judg. 14:5-20).

   Against the wishes of his parents, Samson insisted on marrying a
Philistine woman (Judg. 14:3). So his parents went with him to Timnah
(verse 5), undoubtedly to make arrangements for the marriage. At
some point along the way, Samson was traveling alone when a lion
roared at him.

   Why did the Spirit of the Lord rush upon Samson so that he
tore the lion apart with his bare hands (Judg. 14:6)? He was to
deliver Israel from Philistines, not from lions.


   Which of the following best answers the above question?
1. If the Spirit of the Lord had not empowered him to kill the lion, the
   lion would have killed him, and then he could not have delivered
   anyone.
2. The Lord let him see what he could do to a lion, so that he would
   have no fear of human beings.
3. In this way the Lord set up the circumstances for Samson's riddle
   (verse 14), which was to carry out His purpose by causing conflict
   between Samson and the Philistines (verses 15-20; compare verse
   4—"for he was seeking a pretext," NRSV).
4. When Samson told his wife the meaning of the riddle (verse 17), he
   may well have included some description of the circumstances
   behind it, which she may have passed on to the Philistines. If so,
   this would explain why the Philistines apparently did not attempt to
   apprehend Samson after he killed 30 men in their city of Ashkelon
   (verse 19). Thus, the awesome feat that Samson had performed
   against the lion would have furthered God's purpose by intimidat-
   ing the Philistines. Verse 11 suggests that they may have been
   impressed with his strong appearance even before they knew the
   riddle: When they saw him, "they brought thirty companions to be
   with him," perhaps partly to keep him under control.
5. Another answer:

6. All the above.

   What does this story (Judg. 14:5-20) reveal about the character
of Samson, his wife (verses 16, 17), and the Philistines (verse 15)?


    Illustrate how God sometimes uses situations existing in our
 lives to fulfill His purposes.

"JUDGE" WITH A GRUDGE (Judg. 15:1-8).

    Mr. and Mrs. Samson had gotten off to a rocky start. Rather than
telling her new husband about the threat of her ruthless, cruel country-
men to burn her and her father's house, she showed disloyalty to
Samson by betraying his secret (Judg. 16:15-17). Ironically, she ended
up suffering the very fate that she had tried to avoid.

  What chain of circumstances led to the death of Samson's wife?
Judg. 15:5, 6.


   One thing led to another, in a series of "cascading consequences"
shaped by human choices in accordance with the characters of the
individuals involved. Killing the lion and eating the honey led Samson,
who was clever, as well as strong, to invent a riddle and challenge the
Philistines with a wager. To solve the riddle and win the wager, they
intimidated his wife into betraying him, which infuriated him so that
he abandoned her. Thinking that the abandonment was permanent, her
father betrothed her to the best man at Samson's wedding. When his
anger abated and he again felt desire for his wife, Samson returned to
take up marital relations. But because she was now betrothed to
someone else, her father could not give her to Samson. So Samson
took revenge by arson on a grand scale. Their crops gone, the Philis-
tines blamed Samson's father-in-law for provoking him and burned
the father-in-law along with his daughter, Samson's now ex-wife.

   If Samson were angry with his wife and father-in-law, why did
he want revenge on the Philistines when they burned them? Judg.
15:7, 8.


   Which of the following best answers the above question?
1. Samson was appalled by this excessively brutal act.
2. Samson was angry with the Philistines anyway and was ready for
   any excuse to do them more damage.
3. It appears that Samson still had some loyalty to the woman he had
   loved.
4. Another answer:

5. All the above.

    Have you experienced "cascading consequences" (one thing
 leading to another) in your life, including your spiritual life?
 How have you related to these consequences?

COUNTERREVENGE COUNTERED (Judg. 15:7-15).

   To avenge the death of his wife, Samson wiped out a group of
Philistines, perhaps the same ones who had burned his wife. "He
struck them down hip and thigh" (Judg. 15:8, NRSV), that is, he
destroyed them completely.
   The Philistines had not retaliated directly against Samson, most
likely because they were afraid of him. Now they could no longer
tolerate his being on the loose. So he chose to live in an isolated place,
where he could defend himself against capture.

  What was the principle on which the Philistines and Samson
were operating? Judg. 15:10, 11.


   Both sides were trying to do to the other what the other side had
done to them. This principle of retaliation is the "ungolden rule," in
contrast to Jesus' "golden rule": "Do to others what you would have
them do to you" (Matt. 7:12, NIV).

  How did the men of Judah help Samson, and how did he dem-
onstrate his faith in God? Judg. 15:12-15.


    Samson's 3,000 fellow Israelites did not intend to help him. Had
they fought with him, who knows what deliverance could have been
wrought. But their fear overshadowed any faith in God. Nevertheless,
the cowardly Judahites unwittingly helped Samson by setting up a
situation in which the Philistines were surprised. Thinking that he was
theirs, the Philistines rushed upon him, but the Spirit of the Lord
rushed upon Samson, and he wiped them out.
   The fact that Samson had allowed himself to be bound shows his
great confidence in the strength given him by the Spirit of the Lord. He
was a hero of faith (Heb. 11:32).
    Samson must have been remarkably muscular, but he was not muscle-
bound. He was fast enough to kill a lion (Judg. 14:6), to catch 300
jackals (Judg. 15:4), and to do hand-to-hand combat against an entire
army (Judg. 15:15). His physical prowess was superhuman. With God's
Spirit working through him, he was invincible.
    Barak had led 10,000 brave volunteers (Judg. 4:10); Samson now
fought alone. The spiritual deterioration of the Israelites was reflected
in their shortage of courageous individuals.

    What can we accomplish when we have confidence in what
 the Holy Spirit can do through us? (See Acts 1:8.)

MIRACLE WATER (Judg. 15:16-19).

   After Samson killed 1,000 Philistines, he celebrated in the same
way that Deborah and Barak had: with a poem (Judg. 15:16; compare
Judges 5). His poem is short, but like his riddle, it is clever. (See Judg.
14:14.) It includes a wordplay on donkey and heap, which sound
identical in Hebrew: Bilchi hachchamor, chamor chamoratayim ("With
the jawbone of a donkey, a heap, two heaps").

   In what predicament did Samson find himself? Judg. 15:18.


   Killing 1,000 men with the jawbone of a donkey (Judg. 15:15) was
hard work, even for Samson. So after his deliverance and his poem,
Samson was dehydrated, in a hot country without water. He was in real
trouble.
   Compare the situation of the Israelites after their deliverance from
Pharaoh at the Red Sea (Exod. 14:21-31): they celebrated with a song
(Exod. 15:1-21), after which they found themselves in the wilderness
without water (verse 22).

  What did Samson's prayer (Judg. 15:18) reveal about his de-
pendence upon God?


   The Lord had given Samson superhuman strength, but He did not
keep him from becoming weary and dehydrated. Samson had won, but
without divine help, he would have died right there. He was com-
pletely dependent upon his heavenly Father, an important thing for
him to understand.
   Jesus demonstrated the importance of recognizing dependence upon
the heavenly Father. The Spirit led Him into the wilderness, and after
40 days of fasting, He was hungry (Matt 4:1, 2). Then Satan tempted
Him to neglect dependence upon His Father for physical needs (verses
3, 4). When the defeated foe departed, angels came and ministered to
Jesus, who was weak and exhausted (Matt. 4:11).
   Just as angels ministered to Jesus after His victory, and just as God
provided water for the Israelites in the wilderness (Exod. 15:25), even
bringing water for them out of rocks (Exod. 17:6; Num. 20:10, 11), so
God miraculously provided for Samson in answer to his prayer (Judg.
15:19).

   Do you live and pray in harmony with the fact that you are
 dependent upon God? (See Dan. 5:23.) How can we learn to have
 greater dependence upon Him?

                                                                        85

FURTHER STUDY: On the need of total dependence upon God,
read: Ps. 127:1; Jer. 10:23; John 3:27; 15:5; 2 Cor. 3:5. Read Ellen G.
White, Patriarchs and Prophets, "Samson," pp. 563, 564.

   "Thousands of Israelites witnessed Samson's defeat of the Philis-
tines, yet no voice was raised in triumph, till the hero, elated at his
marvelous success, celebrated his own victory. But he praised himself,
instead of ascribing the glory to God. No sooner had he ceased than he
was reminded of his weakness by a most intense and painful thirst. He
had become exhausted by his prodigious labors, and no means of
supplying his need was at hand. He began to feel his utter dependence
upon God, and to be convinced that he had not triumphed by his own
power, but in the strength of the Omnipotent One.
     "He then gave God the praise for his deliverance, and offered an
earnest prayer for relief from his present suffering. The Lord
hearkened to his petition and opened for him a spring of water. In
token of his gratitude Samson called the name of the place En-hakkore,
or 'the well of him that cried.' "—Ellen G. White, Signs of the Times,
October 6, 1881.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. In Wednesday's lesson, we mentioned Samson's faith in the
     strength given him by the Spirit of the Lord, as shown by
     the fact that he allowed himself to be bound. How does this
     idea relate to the quotation given above? Have you, like
     Samson, had experiences that taught you not to rely on your
     own abilities, but on those given to you by God?

   2. What kinds of problems are caused today by marriages of
      believers with nonbelievers? How far should parents go in
      trying to prevent such marriages? Can two Seventh-day
      Adventists marry and then experience problems of a mixed
      marriage due to differing leve f s iritual commitment?

SUMMARY: Samson was a one-man army for the Lord. To use him
effectively, in spite of his failures, God allowed a chain of circum-
stances in which he and the Philistines provoked each other. At crucial
times, the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him and enabled him to
wreak havoc upon them. As Samson was dependent upon God's power,
so are we. Only by complete trust in Him can we fulfill our mission in
life.

                        The Saloon Church, Part 2
                                James H. Zachary

           Uncle Elijah stood behind the bar ready to serve drinks. As he
        waited, he listened to the interesting seminar being taught in his
        saloon. But no one bought a drink all evening.
           Young Lica' s life had been changed when he attended a Rev-
        elation Seminar. He wanted to share his new faith with people in
        his hometown in Romania. When he could not rent the town hall
        or a school classroom, he offered to rent the saloon. Uncle Elijah,
        the bartender, accepted the offer, hoping for more business.
           Lica invited everyone he could find to the meetings. He saw a
        young woman weeding her garden and asked what she was doing.
           "Can't you see? I am pulling weeds," she said.
           "You need to be pulling some other weeds," he responded.
        Surprised, she asked him what he meant. "The weeds of sin in
        your heart," he replied. "Come to the Revelation Seminar and
        learn for yourself." The young woman and her sister came every
        night. When they took their stand to be baptized, a great storm of
        anger swept over their family. Pastor Titi Gadea, seminar leader,
        visited the parents, who were impressed by his Christlike de-
        meanor. Reluctantly they accepted their daughters' decisions.
           Two other women decided to be baptized, but when their hus-
        bands learned of their plans they drove the women from their
        homes. The new believers prayed for them and for their husbands.
        Alone now, the men talked about how their wives had changed.
        They seemed more loving since they attended the meetings. The
        husbands found their wives and begged them to come home.
           Uncle Elijah's saloon was filled with people, but no one drank
        his liquor. He went bankrupt and closed the saloon. He tried to sell
        the business, but no one wanted an old saloon. However, the little
        group of believers needed a church home. So they pooled their
        meager resources and purchased the building. Now if you were to
                                           walk by the old saloon on Sab-
                                           bath morning, instead of rowdy
                                           conversation, you would hear
                                           songs of praise.

                                             James H. Zachary recently
                                          retired from the Ministerial

             Strong and Weak




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Judg. 15:20-16:31.

  MEMORY TEXT: "He did not know that the Lord had de-
  parted from him" (Judges 16:20, NKJV).

  KEY THOUGHT: Samson was physically strong but morally
weak. By surrendering his special relationship to God, he lost God's
power, the secret of his success.

   THE WEAKEST POINT. The Great Wall of China, stretching for
thousands of miles across northern China, is the longest structure built
by human beings. It stands about 25 feet high and has thousands of
watchtowers. Construction of the wall, done entirely by hand, took
centuries and required hundreds of thousands of laborers, working
under tremendous hardship, with the loss of many lives.
   According to Chinese historical sources, the wall was begun by
Shih-huang-ti, a ruler of the Ch'in dynasty, who ruled from 221-210
B.C. His intention was to defend China's border against warlike tribesmen
who lived in the Mongolian plains to the north. But there have been
many occasions when the wall has failed to protect China. The north-
ern enemies have simply found the weakest, most lightly guarded
points, and poured through. Because some of China's governments
were weak and corrupt, the massive walls were not always well de-
fended. China's northern enemies were often able to surmount them.
   A wall, a chain, or a person is only as strong as the weakest point.
Physically, Samson was the strongest man who ever lived, as far as we
know. But he had a weak point. Once his enemies found it, he soon
became history.

IRRESISTIBLE FORCE (Judg. 15:20-16:3).

   Coming immediately after the story of Samson's great victory with
the jawbone of a donkey, the notice that he judged Israel for 20 years
(Judg. 15:20) implies that the Philistines did not again successfully
trouble the Israelites for several years.
   Before Samson's victory, the Philistines had felt free to raid the
Israelites. That is how they had tried to capture him: They made a raid,
intimidating the Judahites into helping them (Judg. 15:9-13). But after
Samson's victory, the book of Judges does not record another battle
between him and the Philistines. Fear must have kept them from
attempting to capture him. As long as he remained free, the Philistines
would not dare risk arousing him to retaliatory action by attacking his
people.

  How did Samson foolishly jeopardize his safety and that of his
people? Judg. 16:1, 2.


   As Israel's deliverer, Samson had a great responsibility. But he
made a foolhardy excursion to indulge his sexual appetite. Fascinated
by foreign women, he had married a Philistine. (Compare 1 Kings
11:1-8.) Now he sought a liaison that was not only out of bounds
owing to the fact that the woman was a Philistine; it was outside the
bounds of marriage altogether.
   The prostitute was also outside the bounds of safe territory; she was
in Gaza, a strongly fortified, walled Philistine city. Thirsting for re-
venge, the Philistines surrounded Samson and laid an ambush at the
city gate where he would go out in the morning.
   "At midnight, Samson was aroused. The accusing voice of con-
science filled him with remorse, as he remembered that he had broken
his vow as a Nazarite. But notwithstanding his sin, God's mercy had
not forsaken him. His prodigious strength again served to deliver
him."—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 565.
   The Philistine soldiers did not stop Samson. Nor did the heavy city
gate, which was attached to the ground: "Samson seized the bar that
was locked through gateposts and, exerting his magnificent strength,
uprooted the posts. . . . Samson carried away the whole mass in one
piece, the doors and the entire framework."—SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 2, p. 396.

   Why does God sometimes deliver people who are presumptu-
 ous and overconfident, but He does not deliver others? Illustrate

SAMSON'S WEAKNESS (Judg. 16:4, 5).

   Samson "fell in love with a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose
name was Delilah" (Judg. 16:4, NRSV). She is not called a Philistine
or a harlot. Perhaps Samson had learned his lesson regarding Philis-
tines and prostitutes. Delilah lived near Zorah, which was Samson's
home (Judg. 13:2), so she may have been an Israelite. The fact that she
was free to be alone with Samson suggests that she was an unattached
woman not under the control of male relatives.

  Why did the Philistines think they could use Delilah to trap
Samson? Judg. 16:5.


   Whatever Delilah's nationality, Samson was not married to her. So
she did not have the commitment to him that a wife would have had.
Recognizing an opportunity to accomplish what force had failed to do,
the rulers of the Philistine city-states offered her an enormous bribe to
betray Samson-1,100 pieces of silver from each of them. If the rulers
of all five Philistine cities were involved, the total amount was 5,500
shekels, equivalent to the value of 183 slaves at 30 shekels each. (See
Exod. 21:32.)
   This was not the first time the Philistines had used a woman to pry a
secret out of Samson. (Compare Judg. 14:15-17.) His wife gave in to
the threat of burning. A threat would not work with Delilah; she knew
that Samson could protect her.

   What made Samson so vulnerable where women were con-
cerned? Judg. 14:1-3, 15-17; 16:1, 2, 4.


   Which of the following best answers the above question?
1. Samson had a strong need for affection, but since his marriage had
   failed, he had serious emotional hang-ups.
2. Seeking intimacy outside the safety of marriage to an Israelite
   woman, he came under the influence of women who had little
   vested interest in him.
3. He couldn't bear to see a woman he loved unhappy day after day.
   So an unhappy woman could put a lot of pressure on him.
4. Another answer:

5. All the above.

   What can you do if your relationships make you spiritually
 vulnerable?

ATTEMPTS AT BETRAYAL (Judg. 16:5-14).

   The Philistines assessed Delilah's character accurately enough. Perhaps
her love of money was known to them. In any case, their bribe out-
weighed her loyalty to Samson. Of course, she only agreed to betray
Samson into the control of the Philistines; they said nothing about
killing him (Judg. 16:5).

  How did the Philistines get the idea that there was some secret
behind Samson's strength? Judg. 16:5.


   The magnitude of Samson's achievements made it clear that his
strength had a supernatural aspect. For example, David and Benaiah
also killed lions (1 Sam. 17:34-37; 2 Sam. 23:20), almost certainly
using weapons, but Samson ripped a lion apart with his bare hands
(Judg. 14:6). When Samson uprooted the city gate of Gaza and carried
the entire structure to the top of a hill (Judg. 16:3), the Philistines must
have been speechless with amazement. The Philistines "imagined that
he probably possessed some magic charm that was the secret of his
power. Perhaps Samson at some time had boasted that there was a
secret source of his strength."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 2,
p. 397.

   What do Samson's responses to Delilah reveal about his level of
trust in her? Judg. 16:7, 11, 13.


   Delilah could not betray Samson without his betraying himself first.
She was not subtle in the way she asked him about his strength; she
basically used the same words with which the Philistines had ap-
proached her. (Compare verses 5 and 6.) Although she was his mis-
tress, he avoided telling her his secret, which was not only a personal
matter; it was a matter of survival. He did not trust her completely, just
as he had not completely trusted his Philistine wife (Judg. 14:16). In
order to satisfy Delilah, he made up strategies for binding him that
sounded as if they revealed his secret.
   If Samson's suspicions were not aroused by Delilah's question, it is
hard to imagine that they were not aroused by the sudden appearance
of the Philistines each time Delilah bound him (Judg. 16:9, 12, 14).

   How does Delilah's approach compare to Satan's? How does
 Satan try to get us to betray ourselves into his power? How
 could Samson have found deliverance, and how can we?


                                                                        91
Wednesday                                                  June 12
THE SECRET OF SUCCESS (Judg. 16:13-20).

    The Philistines asked Delilah to find a way to bind Samson suc-
cessfully (Judg. 16:5), so she asked him how he could be bound (verse
6). Thus, he told her how to bind him, first with seven fresh bow-
strings (verse 7) and then with new ropes (verse 11). Since the secret
of his strength had nothing to do with how he could be bound, these
things were no more effective than the new ropes with which the
Judahites had bound him earlier (Judg. 15:13, 14).

   How did the third strategy for binding Samson (Judg. 16:13,
14) come dangerously close to the true secret of his strength?


   Like the first two, the third strategy had to do with binding, but it
also involved Samson's hair, which was the real secret. It appears that
he was beginning to weaken in his resolve not to betray himself to
Delilah.

  What was the connection between Samson's hair and his strength?
Judg. 16:17-20.


   There was nothing magical about Samson's hair. But the Lord had
made it a sign of Naziriteship, a special, holy relationship with Him-
self (Judg. 13:5). The gift of superhuman strength from the Spirit of
the Lord was not simply for Samson; it was for Samson the Nazirite.
When his hair was cut off (Judg. 16:19), his Nazirite status was cut off.
Since he was no longer Samson the Nazirite, he was also cut off from
the Source of his strength.
   Samson's life reflects dynamics that characterized the experience
of the Israelites during the period of the Judges. God chose him for a
privileged covenant relationship, as He had chosen them. His special
relationship with God, and theirs also, was conditional upon obedi-
ence, which included the maintenance of a distinct lifestyle. As long as
Samson and the Israelites kept God's covenant, they were invincible.
When they formed liaisons with unbelievers, they gave in to evil
influences and gave up their special relationship with God. Then they
were powerless. They were like worthless salt, which has lost its
distinctiveness (Matt. 5:13), and like dead branches disconnected from
their trunk (John 15:6).

   What is the secret of your spiritual success? Do you need to
 keep it a secret?

CARNIVAL AND CARNAGE (Judg. 16:21-31).

   Samson awoke, thinking he could win as usual. But he didn't know
that the Lord had left him (Judg. 16:20). As far as the Philistines were
concerned, death was too good for Samson; their revenge demanded
lingering suffering. Blind and grinding at a Philistine mill, his physical
condition reflected what he had been spiritually all along: a blind slave
to sin (verse 21).

  What happened to other people in the Bible who were forsaken
by God because they rejected Him?

1 Sam. 28:5-7; 31:2-10

2 Chron. 36:15-21

Matt. 27:3-5

   The overjoyed Philistines proclaimed a joyous religious festival
and brought out Samson for all to gaze upon. Samson decided to get
the final revenge. His hair had begun to grow again, but more impor-
tant, he realized his dependence upon God and remembered how to
pray, as he had when he nearly died of thirst (Judg. 15:18). This time,
his prayer was not for self-preservation but for revenge (16:28).
Nevertheless, as before, God used Samson's revenge to further His
plan: partial deliverance of the Israelites from the Philistines (13:5).
By bringing a crowded building down upon his own head, he de-
stroyed more Philistines than he had during the rest of his life (16:30).
Samson, the lone avenger, was a great deliverer.

  Did Samson commit suicide or perform self-sacrifice? Judg.
16:28-30.


   God helped Samson to do what he did. Since God does not approve
of murder (Exod. 20:13), would He have helped Samson to commit
suicide, which is self-murder? Hardly. Samson's goal was not the
destruction of himself but the destruction of his enemies, who were
Israel's enemies. He helped Israel by sacrificing his own life.
   Divine retribution, which God used His people to dispense, at
various stages of their history, to the incurably lost, was not murder; it
was execution, capital punishment. In our much different social set-
ting, the execution of unrepentant unbelievers is not our work. God
administers punishment. (See Heb. 10:26-31.)

teaching to God's plan to use Samson to deliver Israel from the
Philistines? Read Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, "Samson,"
pp. 565-568.

   "Samson in his peril had the same source of strength as had Joseph.
He could choose the right or the wrong as he pleased. But instead of
taking hold of the strength of God, he permitted the wild passions of
his nature to have full sway. The reasoning powers were perverted, the
morals corrupted. God had called Samson to a position of great re-
sponsibility, honor, and usefulness; but he must first learn to govern by
first learning to obey the laws of God. Joseph was a free moral agent.
Good and evil were before him. He could choose the path of purity,
holiness, and honor, or the path of immorality and degradation. He
chose the right way, and God approved. Samson, under similar tempta-
tions, which he had brought upon himself, gave loose rein to passion.
The path which he entered upon he found to end in shame, disaster,
and death. What a contrast to the history of Joseph!"—Ellen G. White,
Signs of the Times, October 13, 1881.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Like Solomon (1 Kings 11:1-8), Samson was fascinated by
     foreign women. Can you think of some reasons why "grass
     is greener on the other side of the fence"?

   2. What similarities and differences can you see between the
      life of Samson and that of Jesus?

   3. Samson's hair was a sign of his special relationship with
      God. What is the sign of our relationship with God? (See
      Exod. 31:12-17; Ezek. 20:12, 20.) How does studying the
      importance of Samson's sign in his life affect your view of
      the place of God's sign in your life?

SUMMARY: Seeking sinful pleasure and trusting in his own strength,
Samson made himself vulnerable. But his strength was not ultimately
his own. It was a gift from God. When he gave up his relationship with
God, he was easily overcome by his enemies. Nevertheless, God
answered Samson's final prayer in order to help His people. Even so
today, God works through weak instruments who seek His help.

    ‘:;111111/.                   The Unsung Hero
                                   Wendell M. Serrano

             Felipe de Ramos lived in a mountainous village in the Philip-
         pines. He married a faithful Adventist woman, but showed no
         interest in religion. One morning, Felipe heard his wife pray:
         "How long, Lord, shall I serve You alone? What more can I do to
         help my husband accept You? Have I not been a good Christian
         wife? Have I kept him from following You?"
             Felipe was touched and hugged his wife, expressing sadness for
         resisting God. He studied the Bible with her and soon was baptized.
         He was impressed by the urgency of God's message, and he prom-
         ised God he would share his new-found faith with others.
              Felipe wanted to share the gospel with every non-Adventist in
         his village. He set out with his Bible and a picture roll, and gave
         Bible studies to anyone who would listen.
             Some members of the Villabito family began studying the
         Bible. This family followed a strange religious cult. One son,
         Marcelino, feared that the family charms would become power-
         less if the family continued studying the Bible. He warned Felipe
         to stop coming.
             But Felipe was not afraid. He arrived for the Bible study,
         unfolded his picture roll, and opened his Bible. Marcelino slipped
         into the room holding a 24-inch knife. He challenged Felipe's
         God to protect him and plunged the knife into Felipe's body,
         killing him.
             I conducted Felipe's funeral service. I wanted to help the fam-
         ily seek justice for their father's death, but Felipe's children told
         me that they had visited Marcelino's cell and told him, "Our
          father is dead, but he will receive his reward of everlasting life.
          He would want you to be set free from the chain of sin, so we will
          set you free from this prison cell. But remember, only God can set
          you free from eternal punishment. Go from here, and search for
          the way to eternal life."
             I moved to another area and lost contact with Felipe's family.
          Six years later, I returned to speak at a camp meeting in their area.
          While sitting on the platform, the pastor pointed to a man seated at
          a corner. It was Marcelino, Felipe's killer!
             "Marcelino is a Seventh-day Adventist, and a delegate to this
          seminar," the pastor said. "Felipe's killer is now his brother, saved
          from eternal punishment and living in the hope of eternal life."

          Misguided Devotion




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Judges 17, 18.

   MEMORY TEXT: "You shall not make for yourself any carved
   image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or
   that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the
   earth; you shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I,
   the Lord your God, am a jealous God" (Exodus 20:4, 5, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: God accepts worship that is offered according
to His instructions, which leads to a proper understanding of Him. A
blend of true and false worship may be appealing to human beings, but
God does not accept it.

   ROYAL RULES. If you wish to speak with the queen of England,
you cannot simply knock on the door of Buckingham Palace and
expect her to come to the door. She is a queen. You are a common
stranger. Even if you are granted a meeting with her, you must ap-
proach her through a protocol established by the queen and her assist-
ants. She makes the rules. You follow them.
   Like the queen of England, the Lord is a monarch. Not only that,
He is Deity, greater than any earthly monarch. He is the King of kings,
who "is sovereign over the kingdom of mortals; he gives it to whom he
will" (Dan. 4:17, NRSV). Therefore, human beings must approach
Him on His terms. He makes the rules. Those who approach Him in
worship on their own terms rather than His do not honor Him; they
insult Him. That is what the ancient Israelites did when they used idols
to worship the Lord; they insulted Him.

IMAGE WORSHIP (Judg. 17:1-4).

   Samson is the last in a series of "judges," deliverers whose stories
are recounted in the core portion of the book of Judges (Judg. 3:7-
16:31). This part of the book shows how the history of the Israelites in
this period was characterized by apostasy, oppression, and deliver-
ance.
   The end of the book describes two events that show how lawless the
Israelites were during the period of the "judges." That lawlessness is
the theme of this section is clear from the words found near its begin-
ning and at its end: "In those days there was no king in Israel; all the
people did what was right in their own eyes" (Judg. 17:6; 21:25,
NRSV; compare 18:1; 19:1).
   The two events were (1) the idolatry of Micah and the transfer of
this form of worship to the city of Dan (Judges 17, 18) and (2) a crime
committed by Benjaminites and the civil war that resulted (Judges 19,
21). Judges 18:30 and 20:28 indicate that these events occurred in the
time of Moses' and Aaron's grandchildren, before events related ear-
lier in the book.

  What is the significance of the story about Micah and his mother
that is told in Judges 17:1-5?


   The story provides background to Micah's idolatrous worship, ex-
plaining how he came to own images. He had taken silver that be-
longed to his mother. When she discovered it missing, she uttered a
curse, apparently upon whoever had taken it. Hearing the curse, Micah
was apparently afraid and confessed to her, whereupon she promptly
forgave him.
   A problem remained: the curse could not be taken back. It appears
that Micah's mother had inadvertently cursed her son, just as Jephthah
had inadvertently vowed to offer his daughter as a sacrifice (Judg.
11:30, 34, 35). Her subsequent words and actions seem to indicate that
she attempted to neutralize the curse by providing her son with a
blessing. She dedicated the silver to the Lord by having it made into
images for the worship of the Lord, against the Lord's command
(Exod. 20:4), and gave the images to her son.
   Unlike Samson's mother, Micah's mother did not rely on instruc-
tions from God. She had 1,100 pieces of silver, the same amount
promised to Delilah by each of the Philistine rulers for her contribu-
tion to Samson's physical downfall (Judg. 16:5). In the way Micah's
mother used her silver, she contributed to her son's spiritual downfall.

   How would you evaluate your spiritual influence upon others?

                                                                     97

PRIEST FOR HIRE (Judg. 17:5-13).

   Because of his mother's strategy, Micah had a shrine, to which he
added an ephod (a priestly mantle; Exod. 28:6-8) and teraphim (house-
hold idols; Gen. 31:19, 34). He installed (literally "filled the hand of")
one of his sons as his priest. This was blatant idolatry. Gideon had
made an unauthorized ephod to worship the Lord, and it subsequently
came to be worshiped (Judg. 8:27), but Micah and his mother blatantly
set up idolatry from the start. Recognizing the illegitimacy of Micah's
cult in the sight of God, the book of Judges makes the observation at
this point that "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (Judg.
17:6, NKJV).

   Why did Micah seize upon the opportunity to have a Levite as
his priest? Judges 17:13.


   God had chosen the tribe of Levi to serve Him in a special way at
His sanctuary (Exod. 32:26-29). From this tribe, Aaron and his de-
scendants were consecrated to function as priests (Exod. 28:1; Num.
3:2, 3), who were authorized to perform rituals in the sanctuary. Other
members of the tribe of Levi were designated to perform nonritual
labor connected with the sanctuary (Num. 3:5-39; 4:1-33).
   Jonathan, Micah's Levite, was descended from Levi through Moses
and his son Gershom rather than Aaron (Judg. 18:30; compare Exod.
2:21, 22). Note that if your translation of Judges 18:30 reads "Manasseh"
rather than "Moses," it is because the Hebrew text shows the addition
of a Hebrew letter to the name "Moses," thereby changing it. Jonathan
was not qualified to serve as a legitimate priest. But Micah's shrine
was not legitimate, and the Levite would make it seem more legiti-
mate.
   Micah's statement after the installation of the Levite reveals his
motive: "Now I know that the Lord will prosper me" (Judg. 17:13,
NRSV). His underlying goal was not to honor the Lord through a
relationship of love with Him but through material prosperity. He
thought that the presence of ritual objects would ensure God's blessing
and his well-being. (See 1 Sam. 4:3-11.)

   Worship is an offering to God. Is it more important that we
own our worship and can relate to it or that God wants to own and
accept it? Gen. 4:2-5; Exod. 32:1-10.

SPIES (Judg. 18:1-10).

   Following the story of Micah and his idolatry in Judges 17, chapter
18 seems at first to begin a new story about the Israelites of the tribe of
Dan. But the reader soon becomes aware of contact between the
Danites and Micah; the two stories are interlinked.

   Why were the Danites looking for a place to live? Had not
territory been allocated to them, along with the other tribes, in the
time of Joshua? Joshua 19:40-48.


   The original inheritance of the tribe of Dan was in the southwestern
part of Palestine, just north of Judah. This territory included Zorah and
Eshtaol, where Samson lived (Joshua 19:41; compare Judg. 13:2, 25).
The problem with this area was the fact that it was next to the land of
the Philistines, who were not inclined to mind their own business and
respect Israelite borders. Although Joshua 19:47 does not say who
took the territory of the Danites away from them, it was probably the
Philistines.
   Judges 18:30 indicates that the events of Judges 18 occurred at the
beginning of the period of the "judges," but some Danites still lived in
part of their original homeland as late as the time of Samson (Judg.
13:2, 25).
   Before attempting to conquer territory, the Danites sent spies to
find a good place. (Compare Numbers 13 and Joshua 2.) As the spies
passed through the territory of Ephraim, they stayed at Micah's house.
This is important for what happens later.

   How valid was the prediction of the young Levite (Judg. 18:6)
regarding the success of the Danites?


   The Danite spies wanted the security of knowing that their endeavor
would succeed. Since the young priest had ritual objects, they thought
that he could use them to inquire of the Lord. He gave them an answer,
but since he was disobeying God by his form of worship (Exod. 20:4,
5), God would not have spoken through him. (Compare 1 Sam. 28:6;
Ps. 66:18.) The Danites went on their way with false security, thinking
that God was with them. The only kind of people they could conquer
were the weak and unsuspecting, who, like themselves, had false
security (Judg. 18:7).

   Is your spiritual security genuine? On what is it based? What
 could threaten it?

                                                                        99

STOLEN GODS (Judg. 18:11-26).

   The Danites sent soldiers from Zorah and Eshtaol to take the terri-
tory that the spies had found. The place of one of their first encamp-
ments came to be called "Mahaneh-dan" (meaning "camp of Dan")
because they were there. Compare Judges 13:25, speaking of Samson's
being "in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol" (NRSV). If this
were the same Mahaneh-dan, and if it had received its name by the
time of Samson, then the story of Micah and the Danites took place
earlier than the story of Samson. (Compare Judg. 18:30; see Sunday's
lesson.)
   We have found several links between the story of Samson and that
of Micah and the Danites: (1) mothers are prominent; (2) 1,100 pieces
of silver are mentioned (Judg. 16:5; 17:2; see Sunday's lesson); (3)
Samson was a Danite (Judg. 13:2); and (4) the Danites in Judges 18
originated from the same places as Samson.

  Why did the Danites take Micah's ritual objects? Judg. 18:14-
20?


   The spies showed the soldiers the way. As before, they came to
Micah's house. This time, however, they stole the valuable ritual
objects, which, they thought, would give them access to the Lord.
They not only wanted to be able to inquire of the Lord; they wanted a
worship center of their own (Judg. 18:19, 30, 31). Their thinking must
have been similar to Micah's: having a shrine would bring prosperity
(Judg. 17:13). What hypocrisy! They wanted to worship the Lord with
stolen idols!

   How did the Danites persuade the young Levite to cooperate
with them? Judg. 18:18-20.


   The Danites promised the Levite a promotion: he could become
priest of their tribe. Micah pursued the Danites, just as Laban had tried
to recover his household gods when Rachel took them (Gen. 31:19,
22-25, 30-35), but the threats and obvious strength of the Danites
intimidated him (Judg. 18:22-26).

    The silver that Micah had taken (Judg. 17:2) was taken from
 him, illustrating the principle that we reap what we sow (Gal.
6:7, 8). Have you seen this principle operate? Is it God's way of
 giving people what they deserve, or is there another reason for
 it? (See Judg. 1:7; 9:56, 57.)

THE CITY OF DAN AND ITS IDOLATRY (Judg. 18:27-31).

   The Danites succeeded in conquering the northern city of Laish,
which they rebuilt and named "Dan." Because the Danites were suc-
cessful, it might appear that they were people of faith, like the Israel-
ites whose continuation of the conquest of the land is described in
Judges 1. In fact, they succeeded only against "a people quiet and
unsuspecting" (Judg. 18:27, NRSV), a people with faith in a false god
(verse 30, 31).

   Can you find indications that the Danites lacked the faith pos-
sessed by the successful Israelites at the beginning of the period of
the "judges"?

Compare Judg. 1:1 with 18:5

Compare Judg. 1:4-7, 20 with 18:7, 10, 27, 28

   At the beginning of the book, the Israelites did not question whether
they should fight the Canaanites or whether they would succeed. God
had already told them those things (Joshua 1:1-9). Their question was
how the Lord wanted them to go about taking the rest of the land
(Judg. 1:1). The Danites, on the other hand, inquired of what they
thought was the Lord as to whether they would succeed, because they
were unsure of the Lord's presence with them (Judg. 18:5, 6). The
assurance that they received (verse 6; compare verse 10) was a false
assurance; the Lord was not with them.
   At the beginning of the book, the Israelites fought formidable
enemies with large armies, such as Adoni-bezek, who was a conqueror
himself (Judg. 1:5-7), and giants (verse 20). They succeeded because
God was with them. The Danites, on the other hand, succeeded be-
cause their enemy was weak; they simply overpowered them.

  What influence did Micah's idolatry have on the Israelites?
Judg. 18:30, 31.


   The false worship of an individual was accepted by an entire tribe
and region. Not only was this idolatry wrong; it kept Israelites from
participating in the true worship of the Lord's sanctuary at Shiloh, just
as Jeroboam's calf images at Bethel and Dan later kept the Israelites
from going to the temple in Jerusalem (1 Kings 12:26-33).

    Are you successful because the Lord is blessing you, or
 spite of His not blessing you?

                                                                     101

FURTHER STUDY: Read Isa. 40:18-20; 44:6-20; 46:1-9.

  "The second commandment forbids the worship of the true God by
images or similitudes. Many heathen nations claimed that their images
were mere figures or symbols by which the Deity was worshiped; but
God has declared such worship to be sin. The attempt to represent the
Eternal One by material objects would lower man's conception of
God. The mind, turned away from the infinite perfection of Jehovah,
would be attracted to the creature rather than to the Creator. And as his
conceptions of God were lowered, so would man become degraded."
—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 306.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What points made by Isaiah regarding idolatry are relevant
     to the story of Micah and the Danites? (See Isa. 44:9, 10;
     46:1, 2, 7.) Of what relevance is this counsel for us?

   2. What is the significance of the reference to "the captivity of
      the land" in Judges 18:30? (See Lev. 26:33-39; Ps. 73:1-20.)
      Note that Judges 18:30 probably refers to a captivity not
      mentioned elsewhere in the Bible. (See verse 31; the sanctu-
      ary was removed from Shiloh long before the Assyrian
      captivity described in 2 Kings 17.)

   3. Compare the inquiries of the Israelites (Judg. 1:1) and the
      Danites (Judg. 18:5) with the questions of Zechariah (Luke
      1:18) and Mary (Luke 1:34) to Gabriel. Why was Zechariah
      rebuked (Luke 1:20), but Mary was not? What kinds of
      questions do you ask the Lord?

   4. How can we avoid false assurance (Judg. 18:5, 6, 10; Jer.
      6:14; 8:11) and at the same time have true assurance that a
      saving relationship with our Lord is ours now? (See Rom.
      10:9-13; 1 John 5:11-13.)

SUMMARY: Disregarding God's law, Micah's mother made idols,
which Micah used for worship of the Lord. Micah involved his family
and then a young Levite in this idolatry. When the idols were stolen by
greedy Danites and used for a religious center in the newly conquered
northern city of Dan, many Israelites were subjected to this evil influ-
ence.
   One person's disobedience of God often sets in motion a chain of
circumstances that results in many being led into spiritual defeat.

          Olek smelled bad. He talked loudly, and was slow to catch on.
       Poor, simple, and dirty, he smoked, and often was seen staggering
       drunk down the streets. No one thought he would ever amount to
       anything. When he first came to our church, our members tried to
       accept him, but he was so different.
          Fatherless and poor, he was raised by a simple-minded mother
       in a two-room house with no bathroom. An Adventist neighbor
       visited them and encouraged Olek to read the Bible. When Olek
       asked the local priest questions about the Sabbath, the priest
       became angry. That is when Olek began to attend our church.
          Olek had tried repeatedly to stop smoking, but with encourage-
       ment and many prayers, Olek successfully beat the habit. He began
       using a bathtub, and soon smelled better. As he read the Bible, he
       made other changes in his life. He began to wear the clean clothes
       we gave him, and washed his hair more often. He became quieter,
       and more reasonable. He quit drinking coffee, eating unclean meats,
       and finally, after a difficult struggle, he gave up his beloved beer.
          He began preaching the gospel to anyone who would listen. One
       day he saw a priest sitting on a bench reading a book. Olek thought
       the priest was reading the Bible. He greeted him and said, "I see
       you are interested in the Bible." The priest said "Yes I am, but let's
       not talk about it here; come to my house."
          Although Poland is a "Christian" country, people who dare to
       change religions meet with opposition. In some areas people are
       pressured to refuse to rent rooms for religious meetings.
          But Olek dared; he shared his simple knowledge of the Bible
       with the priest. Now he takes more knowledgeable members with
       him. The priest, hungering for truth, asks many questions. He has
       requested to meet the pastor. And Olek, in his simple, childlike
                                  way, shares the gospel, afraid of no one,
                                  because Jesus is with him.

Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Judges 19-21.

  MEMORY TEXT: "In those days there was no king in Israel;
  everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (Judges 21:25,
  NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Abandoning God and His covenant led to moral
depravity comparable to that of Sodom. Purging this evil from Israel
took tremendous effort, pain, and sacrifice, but God ultimately made
the operation successful.

   RETURN TO THE LAW OF THE JUNGLE. The jungle is ruled
by claws and fangs. All creatures are not created equal in the food
chain. The strong prey upon the weak. Vigilance and speed of escape
are crucial for survival; there are two kinds of animals: the quick and
the dead.
   Human society has laws that differ from "the law of the jungle,"
laws that protect people from one another. But these laws are only as
effective as the authorities behind them, authorities that enforce the
law by punishing lawbreakers.
   In ancient Near Eastern societies, human kings were usually the
authorities behind the laws. Israel was different: laws were established
by God, the divine King. But during the period of the "judges," the
Israelites rejected God. Without God and without a human king, their
laws lacked a recognized authority to back them up. "All the people
did what was right in their own eyes" (Judg. 17:6; 21:25, NRSV). The
strong preyed upon the weak according to the only law that was really
in effect, the law of the jungle.

LIKE SODOM (Judg. 19:1-26).

   Judges 19:1 begins a new story that, like the story of Micah and the
Danites, took place "when there was no king in Israel" to keep order.
(Compare Judg. 17:6; 18:1.) Also like the previous story, chapters 19-
21 involve (1) a Levite resident alien in the hill country of Ephraim
(19:1; compare 17:1, 7-12); (2) Bethlehem in Judah (19:1-3; compare
17:7-9); (3) a trip to get something or someone back (19:3; compare
18:22); (4) crime (19:22-26; compare 18:17-20); (5) unfaithfulness by
an Israelite tribe (20:12-16; compare 18:30, 31); and (6) an attempt to
help a tribe survive (21:6-23; compare 18:1, 2, 27-29).

  How did a Levite come to encounter danger in Gibeah? Judg.
19:1-24.


   A Levite traveled to Bethlehem to retrieve his concubine, who had
been unfaithful to him (following the Hebrew rather than some ancient
versions, which read "became angry with him"). Her father detained
him for several days, until he became frustrated and left with his
concubine later in the day than he should have. He found himself
spending the night in Gibeah, which belonged to Benjaminites. Only
an elderly Ephraimite would take him in, along with his servant and
concubine.
   The men of Gibeah were not only inhospitable; they were sexual
perverts like the men of Sodom and, like them, wanted to commit
homosexual rape. (Compare Gen. 19:4, 5.) Israelites had sunk so low
that they were like Sodomites! Like Lot, the old Ephraimite recog-
nized the extreme severity of the situation and his responsibility to
protect a guest. (See Lev. 18:22; 20:13.) Also like Lot, he offered
women to the attackers to satisfy their lust. (Compare Gen. 19:6-8.) It
is horrifying to see what a low value was placed upon women, even by
the more righteous individuals in these stories!

   What finally satisfied the men of Gibeah? Judg. 19:25, 26.


   Whereas the two angels staying with Lot prevented the men of
Sodom from carrying out their intention (Gen. 19:10, 11), the Levite
took his emergency into his own hands by shoving his concubine out to
the men, whereupon they raped her all night literally to death (Judg.
19:28; 20:5).

    What is the true value of a woman? (See, for example, Gen.
2:23, 24; Gal. 3:28, 29; Phil. 4:3.)

                                                                   105

FROM A CRIME TO A CIVIL WAR (Judg. 19:27-20:17).

   In the morning, the Levite found his concubine lying with her hands
on the threshold, clutching to the hope of protection. But he had not
protected her. Now he callously ordered her to get up. No wonder she
had left him in the first place (Judg. 19:2)! There was no answer. She
was dead.

   Why did the Levite send pieces of his concubine throughout
Israelite territory? Judg. 19:29, 30.


   Even if he had not been sympathetic to the feelings of this woman,
the Levite was outraged by what the men of Gibeah did. He was
powerless against them, but his horrifying, gory "correspondence" was
an effective strategy to marshal wide support for justice. (Compare
1 Sam. 11:5-7.)
   Even "the law of the jungle" had its limits! Perhaps the Israelites
were afraid of God's retribution against them collectively if they did
not destroy the evil from among them. (Compare the story of Achan,
Joshua 7.) Something had to be done, but what? The problem was so
serious that the Israelites spontaneously gathered together at Mizpah.
Upon hearing the testimony of the Levite, the people resolved to attack
Gibeah to punish its inhabitants for their deed.
   Resolution of the matter was more difficult than the Israelites had
imagined at first. Rather than cooperating by giving up the criminals of
Gibeah, the Benjaminites mustered their forces to protect Gibeah.

   Why is the story of the Levite and his concubine (Judges 19) in
the Bible?


    Since the Bible contains a record of God's dealings with sinners,
and since sin is ugly, there are parts of the Bible that are not pretty. If
the story of Judges 19 shocks us by showing the depths of depravity to
which God's professed people can sink when they turn from Him, then
it has gone a long way toward accomplishing its purpose. The positive
point is: by cherishing our relationship with the Lord and His law,
which is the divine plan for our well-being based upon loving relation-
ships with Him and with other human beings, we can avoid an other-
wise inevitable slide to moral degradation.

    Does collective moral responsibility operate within the church
 today? If so, how?

ANGUISH AND AMBUSH (Judg. 20:18-48).

  As at the beginning of the book of Judges, where events close to the
same time are described (Judg. 20:28), the Israelites inquired of the
Lord who should lead the battle against the Benjaminites. The answer
was the same: Judah (Judg. 20:18; compare 1:1, 2). But this time they
were going to war against fellow Israelites rather than Canaanites.

  Why did the Lord let the Israelites lose two battles against the
Benjaminites? Judg. 20:19-25.


   The defending Benjaminites had some advantages over the other
Israelites: (1) superior military skill (Judg. 20:16; compare 3:15—
Ehud was also an effective left-handed Benjaminite warrior); (2) a
smaller, more cohesive force to coordinate; (3) a better strategic posi-
tion, since Gibeah was situated on a small hill; and (4) knowledge that
they were fighting for the survival of their fellow tribesmen. But had
not the Lord directed Judah to lead the way? (verse 18). When the
people inquired of the Lord after the first battle, He told them to go up
a second time (verse 23).
   "The Israelites were not allowed to win a victory until after a
preparatory period. The setbacks effectively drove them to fasting and
prayer and to an earnest inquiry as to the cause of their failure. The
delay was God's opportunity to point them to their own defects of
character that needed correction as much as to the faults of others, of
which they were so forcefully aware. The Israelites were far too ready
to set out upon the work of correcting their brethren without being
conscious of their own shortcomings."—SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 2, p. 416.
   When, in the theocracy, God commanded the application of capital
punishment, He wanted those implementing it to be right with Him.

  How did the Israelites finally defeat the Benjaminites? Judg.
20:26-48.


   After their second defeat, the Israelites wept, fasted, prayed, and
offered sacrifices (Judg. 20:26). Then the next day the Lord "defeated
Benjamin before Israel" (verse 35, NRSV). This victory, like Gideon's
(Judges 7), was not won without human effort, but it was the Lord who
gave success.

    What should be our personal reaction to our spiritual de-11
 feats? (See Matt. 17:14-21.)

                                                                    107

WIVES FOR SURVIVORS (Judg. 21:1-24).

  In what dilemma did the victorious Israelites find themselves?
Judg. 21:1-4, 6, 7.


   The original intention of the Israelites was to punish the men of
Gibeah (Judg. 20:10). Once they put the Benjaminites to flight, they
could quite easily have accomplished this objective. But in the heat of
battle, they did not think about when to stop (Judg. 20:48). Conse-
quently, they almost entirely wiped out the tribe of Benjamin. All the
women were destroyed, and only some men who had fled during the
battle remained.
   Without wives, the remaining Benjaminite men could not repopu-
late their tribe. The Israelites had earlier sworn that they would not
give their daughters in marriage to Benjaminites. As in the case of
Jephthah's rash vow (Judg. 11:30, 34, 35) and the curse of Micah's
mother (Judg. 17:2), the consequences of what was thought to be an
irrevocable utterance were unforeseen.

   What solutions did the Israelites find for their dilemma? Judg.
21:5, 8-24.


    A second oath solved part of the problem caused by the first oath!
The Israelites had sworn to put to death anyone who did not participate
with them against the Benjaminites. Because the men of Jabesh-gilead
had not come, the Israelites destroyed all the inhabitants of that town
except for the virgin women, whom they gave as wives to the remain-
ing Benjaminites. To maintain the inviolability of a rash oath and to
show compassion to the tribe of Benjamin, they massacred innocent
married women and their children!
   More women were needed. So a second solution was devised.
When maidens danced at the yearly feast of the Lord at Shiloh, they
would be somewhat separated from their family members. The
Benjaminites would have a chance to abduct some of them as wives. In
this way, the Israelites could provide the Benjaminites with wives
without the direct consent that would violate the wording of their oath.
   Drastic remedies were employed to solve a drastic problem, which
the Israelites themselves had caused. What a tragedy that they had not
shown compassion to the Benjaminites a little earlier, before they
killed their families!

   How can we avoid solving problems without causing larger
 problems?

"WHAT WAS RIGHT IN THEIR OWN EYES" (Judg. 21:25,
NRSV).

   Is the statement that "in those days there was no king in Israel;
all the people did what was right in their own eyes" (Judg. 21:25;
NRSV) positive or negative?


    Taken by itself, this observation repeated at the very end of the
book (see also Judg. 17:6) could be neutral or even positive: In the
absence of a central human governing authority, everyone followed
the dictates of his or her own moral judgment. But it is clear that the
moral judgment of the Israelites was faulty because they failed to stay
close to the Lord. He was their King, the authority behind the law that
they should have been keeping. Such observance would have unified
and protected them from themselves and from one another.
    During the period of the "judges," the Israelites enjoyed some
successes when they sought the Lord. But had they followed the
Lord's direction more often, rather than relying upon their instincts
and logic, they could have avoided terrible problems and atrocities.
    The end of the book of Judges points forward to the books of
1 Samuel and Ruth. Samuel was the last of the "judges." Near the
close of his leadership, the Israelites demanded a king (1 Samuel 8).
They recognized their need for continuing leadership, but rather than
seeking renewed commitment to the Lord, they sought a human ruler.
In the end, human kingship would fail as miserably as the earlier tribal
leadership. But ultimate success comes through Jesus, our divine De-
liverer, Judge, and King. (See Rev. 5:9-14.) Jesus was a descendant of
Ruth (Matt. 1:5), the Moabite woman who kept covenant loyalty to
God and human beings during the period of the "judges," in striking
contrast to the covenant disloyalty of the period.
    Like the Israelites, we not only need a legal authority; we need
 forgiveness and the power to keep God's law in spite of our tendencies
 (Rom. 7:14-20). God gives us both through faith in Him! He cleanses
 us from our sins through the blood of Jesus (Rom. 3:21-26) and pours
 true, unselfish love into our hearts through the Holy Spirit (Rom. 5:5).
 With the motivation of love, we come into harmony with God's law of
 love (Matt. 22:36-40), which reflects His character (1 John 4:8).
 Obedience to God requires human cooperation with Him, as did Gideon's
 victory, but success in obedience is a gift of God through the Holy
 Spirit.

   How would you explain to someone else the means bPkvhich
 we can receive God's gifts of forgiveness and obedience?


                                                                    109

FURTHER STUDY: Why did the Lord tell Samuel to appoint a king
over Israel, even though the people's request indicated that they had
rejected the Lord? 1 Sam. 8:7, 22. Read Ellen G. White, Patriarchs
and Prophets, "The First King of Israel," pp. 603-608, on the institu-
tion of kingship in Israel.

   "The days of Israel's greatest prosperity had been those in which
they acknowledged Jehovah as their king—when the laws and the
government which He had established were regarded as superior to
those of all other nations. Moses had declared to Israel concerning the
commandments of the Lord: 'This is your wisdom and your under-
standing in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes,
and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.'
Deuteronomy 4:6."—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets,
p. 605.
   "God desired His people to look to Him alone as their Lawgiver and
their Source of strength. Feeling their dependence upon God, they
would be constantly drawn nearer to Him. They would become el-
evated and ennobled, fitted for the high destiny to which He had called
them as His chosen people."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 606.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Do you value God's law sufficiently? Do you regard it as
     something positive, for your benefit, or as something nega-
     tive? Why do you answer as you do?

   2. How does acceptance of the Lord as your King affect your
      life and worship?

   3. Jeremiah looked forward to the time when God would make
      a "new covenant" (a "new testament") with His people,
      which they would keep because they would allow God to put
      His law within them and write it upon their hearts (Jer.
      31:31-34). When is this prophecy fulfilled, and how do God's
      people internalize His law? What is the relationship be-
      tween the "new-covenant" and the "new-birth" experience
      (John 3:5-8; Heb. 8:10-13)?

SUMMARY: As illustrated in the story of Micah and the Danite and
the story of a Levite, his concubine, and the civil war that followed,
lawlessness during the period of the "judges" showed itself in the form
of wrongs done to God and to human beings, including idolatry, theft,
rape, and murder. When individuals and societies depart from the
Lord, they fall prey to evil inclinations. The result is often tragedy for
multitudes.

                              A Word in Season
     31*-13;7'                     Hannah Moses

            No one can estimate how far reaching an act of kindness or a
        word spoken in season will be.
            On Sabbath afternoons students at Spicer Memorial College go
        into surrounding villages and communities to conduct Branch Sab-
        bath Schools. They teach villagers to sing Sabbath songs, and
        share with them the Sabbath School lesson. The students prepare
        special lessons and songs for the children. Sometimes it is years
        before the full fruits of these Branch Sabbath Schools become
        known.
             In the village of Kirkee, a large group of children met the Spicer
        Memorial students as we entered the village each Sabbath. One of
        the boys who attended the story hour every week was Rajan. We
        looked forward to seeing this bright young man who was learning
        to love Jesus. As our friendship grew, Rajan told us how much he
        wanted to attend a Christian school. With his parents' permission,
        we arranged for him to attend our Adventist boarding school in
        Lasalgaon, India.
             Rajan was thrilled to study in a Christian school, even though he
        missed his family and friends. As he studied his Bible, he accepted
         whole-heartedly the truths of the church and was baptized.
             When he finished high school, Rajan went to Spicer Memorial
        College. On Sabbath afternoons he joined Spicer students at Branch
         Sabbath Schools nearby. After graduation he became an evange-
         list. He never forgot the happy times and the positive influence of a
         Christian education. Eventually he opened up a small school in
         Kohlapur, India. The school has grown until now it has an enroll-
         ment of 1,000 students.
             We never know what will come from our actions when we
         witness for Jesus, but we praise God for the zeal of teachers and
         students at our Christian schools who go out each week to witness
         to their faith in villages Sabbath after Sabbath. We praise God for
         young people like Rajan, who accept the message and become
         witnesses themselves for the Lord.
