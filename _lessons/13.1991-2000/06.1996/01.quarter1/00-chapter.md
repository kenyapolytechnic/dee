               Let's Begin: How to
                Study Your Bible
    Jesus Christ explained why it is so important for everyone to study
the Bible: So that they may have "eternal life: that they may know
you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent" (John
17:3, NIV). As we present various methods of Bible study this
quarter, we first wish to emphasize that the Bible, the infallible Word
of God, is its own interpreter. By this we mean that the Holy Spirit
enables Christ's true followers to see the relationships between Bible
passages, interpreting the message of one passage in the light of all
other Bible truth on the same subject.
    Never before in the history of the world has the Bible been more
available to the general population. Versions of the sacred Scriptures
abound, which are targeted at and marketed for children, youth, and
adults. But at the same time, there seems to be a famine of God's
Word. We have Bibles everywhere—in motels, doctors' offices,
libraries, and most homes in some countries. Yet research indicates
that many are ignorant of what the Bible has to say, and still others
seldom apply Bible truths to the practice of their religion.
    The Bible teaches us that being a disciple of Jesus Christ involves
becoming acquainted with His Word. Ellen G. White suggests: "Through
the study of the Bible, converse is held with patriarchs and prophets.
The truth is clothed in elevated language, which exerts a fascinating
power over the mind; the thought is lifted up from the things of earth,
 and brought to contemplate the glory of the future immortal life.
 What wisdom of man can compare with the grandeur of the revela-
 tion of God?"—Fundamentals of Christian Education, p. 130.
     On a typical evening, the average Christian may watch television
 for two hours or more but only spend minutes reading his or her
 Bible before bedtime. The Valuegenesis research in the North Ameri-
 can Division of Seventh-day Adventists hints that less than one-third
 of families practice a regular worship, using the Bible as their source
 and textbook. How can one know the will of God if there is only a
 brief encounter with His words? Thus this quarter's lessons direct us
 to a new understanding and application of skills in Bible study.
     The goals of this quarter's lesson study are: (1) to underline the
 reason we study the Bible and (2) to put into practice various study
 methods. We want you to try new approaches in order to understand
 and apply significant Bible truth. Special attention will be given to
 the topic of Christian worship. But some study methods lend them-
 selves better to other topics.
     Jesus said: " 'If you abide in My word, you are My disciples
 indeed. And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you
  free' " (John 8:31, 32, NKJV).

The Centrality of the Bible




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Tim. 3:14-17; John 8:31,
32; Prov. 2:1-15.

    MEMORY TEXT: "If you look for it as for silver and search
    for it as for hidden treasure, then you will understand the fear
    of the Lord and find the knowledge of God" (Proverbs 2:4, 5,
    NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: "The Holy Scriptures, Old and New Testa-
ments, are the written Word of God, given by divine inspiration
through holy men of God who spoke and wrote as they were moved
by the Holy Spirit. In this Word, God has committed to man the
knowledge necessary for salvation. The Holy Scriptures are the infal-
lible revelation of His will. They are the standard of character, the
test of experience, the authoritative revealer of doctrines, and the
trustworthy record of God's acts in history."—Seventh-day Adventist
Yearbook 1994, p. 5.

   THE BIBLE IS CENTRAL. Often we avoid deep, detailed, and
thorough study. Unless something captures our imagination or we
sense its deep importance, we can have a difficult time learning it.
   There seem to be three stages of attitudes toward Bible study:
(1) the "Medicine Stage," in which we study because we suspect it
should be good for us to do so; (2) the "Nurture Stage," in which we
recognize that the Bible is important and can help us, but it is often
seen as dry and difficult to understand; (3) the "Garden Stage," in
which we discover the central importance of the message for our
personal spiritual growth. Study becomes exciting and more focused.

THE BIBLE AS TEACHER (2 Tim. 3:14-17; John 8:31, 32).

   How does the study of the Word of God help us to grow? How
can the Bible provide the basis for our beliefs and practices?
2 Tim. 3:14-17.


   The apostle Paul gives us a number of reasons why we should
spend time studying the Scriptures. The first reason is that, as we
search the Scriptures, we come to know Jesus Christ and experience
His salvation (2 Tim. 3:15).
    The second purpose of Bible study is that it assists us in growing
spiritually so that we might be "equipped" for the service of God
(2 Tim. 3:17, NIV). Too often we find that we have knowledge but
are not equipped to cope with our problems. The Bible provides the
means by which we can be ready for problems and provides the
answers when those problems arise.
     Third, verse 16 suggests that the Scriptures are to teach us. Here
is the basis for doctrinal, truth-filled study. We cannot make useful
applications of truth without knowledge. The means of spiritual
growth are teaching, rebuking, correcting, and training in righteous-
ness (2 Tim. 3:16). The Bible is our "guidebook" for living.

   What kinds of information in the Bible help us in our Chris-
tian walk? John 8:31, 32. Reflect on when the Bible has been
most influential in your personal life.


   "In order to exercise intelligent faith, we should study the Word of
God. The Bible, and the Bible alone, communicates a correct knowl-
edge of the character of God, and of his will concerning us. The duty
and the destiny of man are defined in its pages. The conditions on
which we may hope for eternal life are explicitly stated."—Ellen G.
White, Review and Herald, Sept. 22, 1910.
   "The Bible is the only rule of faith and doctrine. And there is
nothing more calculated to energize the mind, and strengthen the
intellect, than the study of the word of God. No other book is so
potent to elevate the thoughts, to give vigor to the faculties, as the
broad, ennobling truths of the Bible. If God's word were studied as it
should be, men would have a breadth of mind, a nobility of character,
and a stability of purpose, that is rarely seen in these times."—Ellen
G. White, Review and Herald, July 17, 1888.

    Can Christians be disciples of Jesus if they do not regularly
 study the Word of God? Explain.

                                                                      7

MADE FREE BY THE WORD OF GOD (John 8:31-47; 2 Cor.
3:17, 18).

  What is the freedom in Christ that is explored in John 8:31-
47? How does one become free from sin?


   In the New Testament the Greek adjective meaning "free"
(eleutheros) occurs 23 times. It is not used in the sense of political
freedom, for Jesus was not a political messiah. The New Testament
does not associate itself with the idea of freedom as some kind of
power to do whatever one wants. Freedom is always seen as what
occurs when we are involved in the "glorious freedom [eleutheria] of
the children of God" (Rom. 8:21, NIV). The believer enjoys freedom
whenever the Spirit of the Lord is present (2 Cor. 3:17, 18).

   According to John 8:31-47, what is the relationship between
freedom and Bible study? Explain, "He who belongs to God
hears what God says" (verse 47, NIV).


   "Let everyone study the Bible, knowing that the word of God is as
enduring as the eternal throne. If you come to the study of the
Scriptures in humility, with earnest prayer for guidance, angels of
God will open to you its living realities; and if you cherish the
precepts of truth, they will be to you as a wall of fire against the
temptations, delusions, and enchantments of Satan."—Ellen G. White,
The Signs of the Times, Sept. 18, 1893.

  What experiences can you share illustrating the freedom in
Christ that has come through your study of the Word?


   "Through the study of the Scriptures we obtain a correct knowl-
edge of how to live so as to enjoy the greatest amount of unalloyed
happiness. The Bible student is also furnished with Scripture argu-
ments so that he can meet the doubts of unbelievers and remove them
by the clear light of truth. Those who have searched the Scriptures
may ever be fortified against the temptations of Satan; they may be
thoroughly furnished to all good works and prepared to give to every
man that asketh them a reason of the hope that is in them."
—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3, p. 374.

   What practical suggestions about reading and studying the
 Bible can you give to struggling Christians?

Tuesday                                                January 2
THE NATURE OF THE SCRIPTURES (Prov. 2:1-15).

   What attitude should we have when looking to Scripture for
answers? According to Proverbs 2:1-15, what are the rewards of
searching God's Word? (Compare 2 Tim. 3:16, 17.)


    Throughout the history of the Christian church most have under-
stood the Bible in much the same way as they have understood the
person of Christ. The incarnation principle that is applied to the
person of Jesus applies to our Bible, as well. The Bible is at the same
time both human and divine. On the one hand, it is the infallible
Word of God, inspired by the Holy Spirit. On the other hand, this
inspired Word was put into imperfect human language by fallen
human beings. This blending of humanity and divinity is sometimes
difficult to understand. Because the Word of God is inspired, it has
deep, eternal relevance and speaks to everyone at any time in the
history of the world.
    "The Bible, and the Bible alone, is to be our creed, the sole bond
of union; all who bow to this Holy Word will be in harmony. Our
own views and ideas must not control our efforts. Man is fallible, but
God's Word is infallible."
    "The Bible is not given to us in grand superhuman language.
Jesus, in order to reach man where he is, took humanity. The Bible
must be given in the language of men. Everything that is human is
imperfect. Different meanings are expressed by the same word; there
is not one word for each distinct idea. The Bible was given for
practical purposes."
    "The Bible is written by inspired men, but it is not God's mode of
thought and expression. It is that of humanity. God, as a writer, is not
represented. Men will often say such an expression is not like God.
But God has not put Himself in words, in logic, in rhetoric, on trial in
the Bible. The writers of the Bible were God's penmen, not His pen.
 Look at the different writers.
    "It is not the words of the Bible that are inspired, but the men that
 were inspired. Inspiration acts not on the man's words or his expres-
 sions but on the man himself, who, under the influence of the Holy
 Ghost, is imbued with thoughts. But the words receive the impress of
 the individual mind. The divine mind is diffused. The divine mind
 and will is combined with the human mind and will; thus the utter-
 ances of the man are the word of God."—Selected Messages, book 1,
 pp. 416, 20, 21.

    Why can we have complete confidence in the Word of God,
 even though human instruments were involved in its production?

                                                                        9

THE BIBLE AS GOD'S REVELATION (2 Peter 1:16-21; Eph.
3:1-6).

   Are there concerns and problems we face that are different
from those of the first-century Christians? What does 2 Peter
1:16-21 tell us about how God reveals Himself to us today?


   God speaks to us through the Bible in a number of ways: First, it
is God's revelation, a collection of accounts of God's revealing
Himself to us and to His people through the centuries. And it records
in detail the greatest revelation of all, Jesus.
   Second, the Bible is a present-day revelation. The Bible says that
"men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God" (verse 21, NASB).
The source of the revelation is God. This fact makes the writings of
Bible authors vitally relevant for every era, including our day.
    Third, the Bible brings truth and conviction to us personally.
Sometimes this is most direct, through the prompting of our thoughts
as we read. The same Spirit of God who inspired the writers often
reveals living messages from God to us.
   Fourth, the Bible's messages have universal application. The
Word of God is for everyone. "All Scripture is God-breathed"
(2 Tim. 3:16, NIV), Paul says, and through it we all can hear what
God hopes for the world and for each individual.

   What does Ephesians 3:1-6 suggest is the relationship between
the written Word and the person of Jesus?


   "When you read this you can perceive my insight into the mystery
of Christ" (Eph. 3:4, RSV). God has revealed Himself to us in at least
four unique ways—nature, Jesus, His Spirit, His Word (including the
prophetic Word; see 2 Peter 1:19). Jesus comes directly to us through
the Holy Spirit.
   "The Holy Spirit has been given us as an aid in the study of the
Bible. . . . When the Bible is made the study book, with earnest
supplication for the Spirit's guidance, and with a full surrender of the
heart to be sanctified through the truth, all that Christ has promised
will be accomplished."—Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Stu-
dents, p. 357.

   What does the Bible teach us about the character of God?
 What do we learn about God and His will through the lives of
 Bible characters?

THE RICHNESS OF GOD'S WORD (James 1:22-25; Ps. 119:96-
105).

  What attitudes toward God's Word are we instructed to adopt?
James 1:22-25.


   The Bible provides a rich texture of comments that are to guide
our lives and help us in the choices we make each day. In Bible times
hearing and doing were closely related. In fact, hearing implied
doing. That is why Jesus often said, "He who has ears to hear, let him
hear" (Luke 14:35, NIV). He meant that since everyone has ears, all
are expected to comply and do what He suggested or commanded.
   Obedience is always implied if the revelation of God in the Scrip-
tures is our authority. James suggests that doers of the Word are the
true believers and are blessed for their response to the revelation of
God.

   What keeps us from becoming a doer of God's Word? Gal.
5:17. What makes the Bible alive in our lives? James 1:25.


   David poetically described his love for the Word of God in Psalm
119. Three qualities are evident in David's experience that helped
him appreciate the wisdom of God in the laws and commandments.
First, he had a deep love for God's will. Second, David knew how to
contemplate the words of God. Through meditation on God's direc-
tions, David claimed that he grew in wisdom. Third, the shepherd-
king found that through obedience to the words of God, he could live
victoriously.
   "If all would make the Bible their study, we should see a people
who were better developed, who were capable of thinking more
deeply, who would manifest greater intelligence than those who have
earnestly studied the sciences and histories of the world, apart from
the Bible. The Bible gives the true seeker for truth an advanced
mental discipline, and he comes from contemplation of divine things
with his faculties enriched; self is humbled, while God and his
revealed truth are exalted."—Bible Echo and Signs of the Times,
October 1, 1892.

    What benefits does Psalm 119:96-105 suggest are in store for
 the diligent Bible student? Why does contemplation of God's
 law have a positive influence on one's spiritual life? When is
 this contemplation legalism, and when is it not? (See The Desire

FURTHER STUDY: Read Genesis 32:22-26. Jacob provides a unique
model for those who wish to grow in their appreciation for God's
Word. For example, when he met God that night, he wrestled with
Him until morning. God said, "Let me go, for the day is breaking"
(RSV). But Jacob said, "I will not let you go, unless you bless me"
(RSV). Jacob provides us with a significant principle for both our
Christian living and our study of the sacred Text. There is no limit to
the number of questions you can ask of your Bible. And with consis-
tent application and careful understanding of the text itself, a number
of personal applications can be drawn. Perseverance is important for
us, just as it was for Jacob when he met God that dark night.

   Read the introduction to The Great Controversy to explore how
the Bible was written. Read also Fundamentals of Christian Edu-
cation, pp. 450, 451, to discover the relationship of Bible study to
the education of youth.

   In our Bible study, we must first find out what the text actually
says; next, we want to learn what it meant to those who lived in Bible
times; and finally, we want to make personal application for our own
spiritual growth.
   Ellen White says that the Bible "is the bread of life and the water
of salvation to all who make it their study. What it means to be a
Christian can be understood only by a careful and prayerful study of
the Word of God."—Manuscript Releases, vol. 18, p. 145.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What goals do you have for personal Bible study?

     2. What are the purposes of Bible study for the members of
        your family or for your own devotions? How do you estab-
        lish regular Bible study in your setting?

     3. What must happen in your spiritual search in order for
        you to find Bible study as fascinating and important as
        noted in Proverbs 2:4, 5 and Psalm 119:96?

SUMMARY: The divine-human encounter that resulted in the Word
of God provides a specific revelation of God's will for humanity.
Without it, we would find it difficult to interpret the purposes of God
in this world. Because we have God's revelation in written form, we
have a Word to follow that is "more sure" than the witness of our
own senses. With the written revelation, we have an objective text to
explore.

                  The Church's Challenge in Rwanda
                             J. J. Nortey
            The Adventist church in Rwanda is picking itself up and start-
        ing to rebuild. But it must build far more than structures; it must
        rebuild itsfaith—faith in God and in one another.
            Rwanda claims that 95 percent of its population is Christian.
        Adventists are the second-largest Protestant denomination, with
        some 300,000 members. During the massive slaughter that con-
        vulsed the country for several months in 1994, an estimated
        10,000 Adventists lost their lives. Thousands more fled the rav-
        aged country for refugee camps in neighboring Zaire.
            Most Adventist believers in Rwanda are Hutus, the majority
        tribe. But pockets of Tutsi members were virtually wiped out. In
        one predominantly Tutsi area, where we had a hospital and mis-
        sion, virtually every church worker was killed-100 pastors, hos-
        pital workers, mission employees, all killed in one spot. One
        report indicates that some 3,000 people were killed on the Mugonero
        hospital grounds. Mass graves cover the ground. Some 2,500
        l ikely were killed in one church building where they had come for
        refuge. This was the largest massacre in the entire country.
            But now Rwandans are beginning to return home, to rebuild
        their faith and their lives. On one Sabbath following the fighting I
         visited four churches in Kigali and found them filled to overflow-
         ing, with people standing outside. Two of these churches hold
        500 to 600 people. At least 2,000 people were worshiping in the
        largest church in Kigali.
            Stories of heartbreak and heroism continue to surface. Two of
        our pastors, who were away from home when the violence began,
         lost their entire families. One man lost his wife and nine chil-
         dren; the other pastor lost his wife, three children, and seven
         grandchildren. The pastors were saved only because members of
                                  the other tribe sheltered them at the risk of
                                  their own lives.
                                     I pray that our believers will put aside
                                  tribal animosities and unite under the ban-
                                  ner of Christ. We are not Hutu or Tutsi;
                                   we are Christians, followers of the Man
                                   who told us to "love one another."

                                 Indian Ocean Division of Seventh-day

The Purpose of Bible Study




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ps. 119:1-18; Matt. 4:1-11;
7:24-27; 28:19, 20; 1 Corinthians 8.

     MEMORY TEXT: "The rain came down, the streams rose,
     and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not
     fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. But everyone
     who hears these words of mine and does not put them into
     practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand"
     (Matthew 7:25, 26, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Among other things, the Bible challenges us
to discover God's will for our lives and to learn how to grow in grace
as we prepare for His soon-coming kingdom.

   PREPARATION FOR BIBLE STUDY. When people gather to
study the Word of God, they bring their personal problems, definite
spiritual challenges, and deep emotional needs to the task. Too often
we leave the exploration of Scripture to scholars. But should Bible
study be left only to those with special knowledge? The answer to
this question is found in the purpose of Bible study.
   In order to be a careful interpreter of Scripture, there is one
primary challenge. We must seek to understand what God is saying
to us. This involves asking the right questions of the Bible text—
questions that the Holy Spirit brings to our minds as we study and
meditate upon particular passages. Thus we can find specific answers
for our individual needs.
   Prayer for divine enlightenment is the first step. (See The Great
Controversy, p. 521.) As we speak and listen to God, our hearts are
prepared to understand His written Word.

BUILDING OF STRONG FOOTINGS (Matt. 7:24-27; Rom. 2:13).

   What are the results in people's lives of the learning that
involves both hearing and doing? Matt. 7:25-27. What does
obedience have to do with hearing God's Word? Rom. 2:13.


    The story of the two builders who chose different building sites
provides the context for us to look at the types of hearers of God's
Word. There is a contrast here between those who hear and do
nothing and those who both hear and do. The people who practice
what they hear are called "wise." These people are not satisfied with
listening passively. They not only hear the call of God to repent and
to believe in Jesus; they both hear and do. They actually believe and
actually repent. Those who do so find that their religion does not fail
them. When "storms" attack, there is safety and shelter. The Bible
challenges us to apply learning to every situation of life.

   What causes people to feel that they cannot follow the instruc-
tion and counsel from God in Scripture? What other types of
hearers are there in the Bible? Matt. 13:1-13, 18-23. How many
of the hearers of Matthew 13 are active hearers, open to learn
about God's truth? What reasons are given for this commend-
able attitude?


   The Bible suggests that people hear the Word of God in different
ways. The story of the soils presents us with a rural illustration.
Farmers regularly had to face the problem of making sure that the
seed planted fell on rich soil containing proper nutrients to make
growth possible. Too often we are impressed with the truth of God's
Word but fail to grow spiritually. Most of the hearers in Matthew 13
found all kinds of reasons not to respond to the teachings concerning
Jesus' kingdom. They allowed present problems, personal lethargy,
lack of individual commitment, and secular influences to choke the
gospel seed.
   The challenge for Christians today is to understand that Bible
truths are designed to move us closer to the kingdom in our attitudes,
beliefs, and actions. The power of Bible seed lies in the power of the
Sower. Christ Himself is the Sower of the seed that is found in the
Bible.

    What do the types of soil referred to in the parable of the
 sower represent in your world? Give a practical application to
 the attitudes depicted in the parable.

                                                                     15

STUDY SYSTEMATICALLY (Acts 17:10-14).

   "The Bible presents a perfect standard of character. This sacred
book, inspired by God, and written by holy men, is a perfect guide
under all circumstances of life. It sets forth distinctly the duties of
both young and old. If made the guide of life, its teachings will lead
the soul upward. It will elevate the mind, improve the character, and
give peace and joy to the heart."—Messages to Young People,
p. 444.

   The book of Acts gives special praise to the Bereans. Using the
chart below, identify what made these people unique. As you explore
Acts 17:10-14, write down their actions or attitudes and their results.

         Description:           Action or Attitude: .      Result:

     1. The people of Berea.

     2. Jewish leaders.

   Haphazard study of the Word of God may very well be an insult to
the sanctity of the Bible. If we use the Bible as a means of occasion-
ally receiving a few inspirational morsels, eventually we will be
disappointed in the results. People who benefit most are those who
study the Bible diligently and eagerly seek God's will.

   What methods would enrich your study of the Bible? How is
studying the Bible like being a good detective? Compare John
5:39 with Luke 24:27, 44.


     Listed below are the steps in basic Bible study:
     1. Observing—seeing the basic facts contained in the passage
        we are studying.
     2. Asking—learning the kind of questions to ask of the text we
        wish to examine and thereby discovering more information.
     3. Interpreting—finding out what the text actually means.
     4. Cross-referencing—comparing scripture with scripture, al-
        lowing the Bible to be its own expositor.
     5. Applying—making life applications.

    What other processes have you found to be helpful in under-
 standing Scripture? Read your favorite passage in the Bible,
 and apply the above five simple steps.

HEARING TO UNDERSTAND (Matt. 22:23-33).

   What skills used in mastery of one's profession can come to
bear in learning to explore the Bible? What are the two reasons
stated in Matthew 22:23-33 that cause people to believe false
doctrine?


    If we are to be disciples of Jesus, a certain commitment is neces-
sary. Men and women must learn to follow God in the deepest sense.
When we ask how people grow, we recognize that various nutrients
are necessary if any of us are to thrive. If we are to grow in any
secular sense, we must understand what nurtures us. For example,
perhaps someone in your congregation is a real-estate salesperson. In
order to represent correctly the client who wishes to purchase a
home, competence demands that the agent master the vocabulary,
process, laws, and formulas with which all must work in order to buy
or sell property. One would expect the "expert" in sales to be an
authority in all that constitutes competence.
    Why not expect that same type of expertise in the Christian? The
source of power, information, values, and knowledge of the future is
revealed in Scripture. In order to explore this rich resource, Bible
study must take priority.
    Jesus taught that study of the Scriptures provides a resource to
combat error in our lives. Matthew 22 shows that near the end of
Jesus' ministry, the Jewish leaders tried to trick Him with compli-
cated questions about their law. Answering one question, which the
Sadducees had designed to entrap Him, Jesus emphasized the impor-
tance of Scripture as the model of truth.
    "The Old and the New Testament Scriptures need to be studied
daily. The knowledge of God and the wisdom of God come to the
student who is a constant learner of His ways and works."
    "Bible reading, the critical examination of Bible subjects, essays
written upon topics which would improve the mind and impart knowl-
edge, the study of the prophecies or the precious lessons of Christ—
these will have an influence to strengthen the mental powers and
 increase spirituality. A familiar acquaintance with the Scriptures
sharpens the discerning powers, and fortifies the soul against the
 attacks of Satan."—Messages to Young People, pp. 189, 397.

    How many times have you determined that you should study
 the Bible but have found that your busy schedule interferes
 with your best intentions? What must you do with your priori-
 ties to focus anew on personal Bible study? What is the best
 time of day for you to spend with God's Word?

                                                                    17
Wednesday                                           January 10
STUDY FOR LIFE APPLICATION (Matt. 28:18-20).

   Even though understanding the meaning of the text is important,
another goal of personal Bible study is application. Our final purpose
of study must be the practical application of biblical principles to our
daily living.
   Dwight L. Moody, the evangelist, asserted that the Bible was
given, not to increase our knowledge, "but to change our lives." The
Bible's purpose is to make us very different people. It can mold our
characters, enabling us to conform in lifestyle to the ultimate model
of love and grace, Jesus Christ. When we recognize this purpose, we
are better equipped to fulfill Jesus' great commission to win others
for His kingdom.
   Often we study to find proof for our own positions. Our motiva-
tion in this may not be deeply Christian. The Bible is not a club to be
used to correct others, even though through our study we may come
to know Bible truth and stand corrected. Nor should the Bible be
used solely as a means of formulating theological propositions, even
though it contains many gems of truth that can be categorized. We do
not study the Bible to impress others with our knowledge. We study
to find direction and purpose from God, as well as to learn God's
plans for the world. This means that Bible study must involve not
only deep, accurate scholarship, but it must move us to live balanced,
practical Christian lives.

  Ask yourself, Which of my attitudes should be changed by
Bible study? What do I need to begin to do or to stop doing if my
Bible study is to be practical? In what ministry for others should
my study of Scripture motivate me to engage?

  Look at the gospel commission found in Matthew 28:19, 20,
and complete the following exercise:
  I . List all the action words found in the passage.
  2. How do you do the things implied by the action words in the
      passage?


   There are multiple purposes for the study of Scripture: to under-
stand what the text actually says; to see how it informed the early
church or the people of the Old Testament; to understand how it
informs the life of the church; to grasp how it instructs and empowers
the individual who is struggling with life's problems. "We must
search the Scriptures . . . which will enrich the mind, and fortify the
soul against the wiles and temptations of the archdeceiver."—Coun-
sels on Sabbath School Work, p. 19.

DEFENSE AGAINST FALSEHOOD (Matt. 25:1-13).

   In these last days of earth's history, the Bible provides insight into
correct thinking and living. "There are practical lessons in the Word
of God. . . . That Word teaches living, holy principles, which prompt
men to do unto others as they would have others do unto them."
—The Upward Look, p. 215.
   The parable of the 10 virgins focuses on faithfulness and wisdom
by contrast with carelessness and foolishness. The emphasis is on
preparation. At the end of earth's history, we will meet God with or
without the Holy Spirit in charge of our lives—we will be either wise
or foolish.

   What preparation can the Christian make in order to be ready
for Christ's return? Matt. 25:1-13.


   All the bridesmaids had lamps containing oil. But the wise brides-
maids had thought to bring flasks containing extra oil. The foolish
ones had no reserves. In making a practical, personal application of
this passage, one might ask the following questions:
   1. What is the major issue in the story?
   2. Contrast the wise with the foolish bridesmaids. Why are they
      different?
   3. Is the moral of this story perseverance in the faith, or is it the
      accumulation of spiritual reserves?

   "Satan is well aware that the weakest soul who abides in Christ is
more than a match for the hosts of darkness, and that, should he
reveal himself openly, he would be met and resisted. Therefore he
seeks to draw away the soldiers of the -cross from their strong fortifi-
cation, while he lies in ambush with his forces, ready to destroy all
who venture upon his ground. No man is safe for a day or an hour
without prayer. Especially should we entreat the Lord for wisdom to
understand his word. Satan is an expert in quoting Scripture, placing
his own interpretation upon passages by which he hopes to cause us
to stumble. We should study the Bible with humility of heart, never
losing sight of our dependence upon God. While we must constantly
guard against the devices of Satan, we should pray in faith continu-
ally, 'Lead us not into temptation.' "—Spirit of Prophecy, 'vol. 4,
p. 350.

    How does Bible study qualify us to distinguish between truth
 and error? What makes us sure that we have a correct under-
 standing of Scripture? What is the Holy Spirit's part in this?

                                                                       19
Friday                                             January 12
FURTHER STUDY: The many parables and stories of Christ's life
teach us that when we trust God, we can withstand the attacks of the
devil. Christ relied on the study of the Scriptures (Old Testament) in
order to gain spiritual victory. How many instances can you remem-
ber in which Jesus allowed God's Word to direct His actions? Read
Matthew 4:1-11. What model of overcoming does this story suggest?
   Study these passages to see the importance of Bible study for your
spiritual growth: Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students,
pp. 166, 167; My We Today, p. 62.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Do you agree with the following assessment? Explain your
     answer. "It's quite clear from the Bible itself that God is
     not concerned merely with our knowing about his people,
     or even, about him. In fact, we might go so far as to say
     that the Bible writers were not interested in knowledge for
     the sake of knowledge . .. they were much more concerned
     about living."—John F. Balchin, David H. Field, Tremper
     Longmann III, eds., The Complete Bible Study Tool Kit
     (Downers Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press, 1991), p. 73.

     2. What is the result when the people of God fail to under-
        stand the Bible for themselves?

     3. What do you believe is the root cause of failure to study the
        Bible on a regular basis?

     4. How would you summarize the practical lessons we can
        learn from Satan's temptation of Jesus in the wilderness?

     5. What is the purpose of your Bible study? What is the
        purpose of Bible study for your family? Do these purposes
        differ? If so, how?

     6. What are some of the challenges we face in developing a
        systematic plan for Bible study?

SUMMARY: The purpose of Bible study includes both systematic
discovery of God's will and application of biblical principles for our
spiritual growth and development. This twofold process of under-
standing and application provides the basis for Christian living. God
needs individuals who are committed to personal study, discovery,
and application to life.

                                     J. H. Zachary

            "I cannot stop talking about Jesus!" says Chung Hyun Hee.
            Mrs. Chung wanted to follow God's will, but was confused by
         so many denominations. One day as she prayed for guidance, a
         knock at the door interrupted her prayer. Opening the door, she
         found several people standing there—Adventists who had come
         to invite her to church. Mrs. Chung attended their church, but
         hesitated to join the Adventist Church.
             However, she felt no peace; her life seemed empty and mean-
         ingless. One night, feeling she had reached a new low point, she
         confessed her sins and promised to follow the Lord wherever He
         led. At dawn she went to the Adventist church to pray. There she
         found assurance that God had accepted her. She began attending
         the Adventist church regularly, and was baptized in May 1993.
             Her one goal became to share Jesus with others. She started
         giving Bible studies to a neighbor couple. What a joy she felt
         when these friends were baptized!
             But her greatest burdens were for her husband and her mother.
         Her husband never attended church and had some unhealthful
         habits. She prayed for him, and God answered her prayers. Her
         husband is now a faithful Christian.
             Her mother, a Jehovah's Witness, resisted her daughter's invi-
         tations to study the Bible. Finally she joined a Revelation Semi-
         nar, but she seemed cold and distant. Mrs. Chung begged God to
         touch her heart. Her joy knew no bounds when her mother ac-
         cepted God's call and was baptized last year—along with two of
         her friends.
             Mrs. Chung's mother is now an active soulwinner. Because
         her husband owns several businesses, she has friends among the
          affluent people in her community. She conducts several Bible
          studies, cooking classes in her home, and regular Revelation
          Seminars. Her motto is "To work for souls until Jesus comes."
                               She has won 17 persons to the Lord in the
                               first year since her baptism.

        Learning to Interpret
           the Bible Text




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Tim. 2:14, 15; Luke
18:18-27; 1 Sam. 8:1-9.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Study to shew thyself approved unto God,
     a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing
     the word of truth" (2 Timothy 2:15).

   KEY THOUGHT: To know the will of God for their lives and to
be equipped for service, Christians must spend time studying their
Bibles. The challenge is to interpret correctly a text that was written
so long ago in the "then and there" and to see its relevance to the
"here and now."

   WHY DO I NEED TO KNOW HOW TO STUDY? When you
open your Bible, you are immediately struck with the varied styles in
which God's written revelation is presented. There are history les-
sons and poetry, laws and psalms, Gospels and epistles (letters),
direct teaching and hundreds of illustrations. The Bible comes to us
through the various forms (genres) chosen by the inspired writers to
frame God's message to us. To understand Scripture, we must spend
time sorting out the styles in which God's counsel to us is presented.
For example, we need to know how we can understand a piece of
poetry, a psalm, or a message of praise directed to God by a writer in
antiquity. We need to understand how the cultural circumstances in
which the Bible authors wrote are reflected in the language and
images they used to express God's thoughts. We will be rewarded as
we recognize the relevance for us of truth written so long ago.

LEARNING WHAT THE TEXT SAYS (Luke 18:18-27).

   When we want to discover what a text says, we use a process
called "exegesis." This is carefully organized study of a Bible pas-
sage to find out what the text meant in the original setting and what it
means to us. We first seek to discover what the text meant to those
who originally heard it.

   Read Luke 18:18-27, and answer the following logical ques-
tions:
   1. What question does the ruler ask?
   2. What answers does Jesus give?
   3. What does Jesus mean when He says, "How hard it is for
      the rich to enter the Kingdom of God! Indeed, it is easier
      for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich
      man to enter the kingdom of God" (Luke 18:24, 25, NIV)?


   We begin interpreting after reading the whole text. Next, we ask
what the text says. For example, in our passage under study today,
we note that Jesus presents an impossibility for us to consider. "How
hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God." He concludes that
a camel can enter the eye of a needle easier than a rich person can
enter heaven. It is said that there was a gate in Jerusalem called the
"Needle's Eye," which animals could enter only by crouching down
and sliding through. The earliest evidence for this idea comes from
an eleventh-century commentary by a Greek churchman named
Theophylact, who had trouble understanding the text as it read. But
the text does state the impossible. Jesus' point is that it is impossible
for a camel to go through the eye of a needle. It is impossible for
those who give priority to riches to have access to the kingdom of
heaven (Mark 10:24). It is impossible, except for God, who can
change the human heart. A materialistic woridview is incompatible
with a Spirit-filled life.
   Learning to read and to think about the text is the first step in
understanding it. The next step is to ask good questions about the
text. There are two kinds of questions we can ask: (1) Those that
relate to the context (the setting of a passage in the biblical account)
and (2) those that relate to the content. We should also discover the
"occasion" or purpose for the text.

    List three other questions you would like to ask the text for
 today's study (Luke 18:18-27). Make sure you ask questions
 about the context and the content of the passage.


                                                                      23

THE HISTORICAL SETTING OF A PASSAGE (1 Sam. 8:1-9).

   Let's begin by asking the first kind of question that we discovered
in the previous daily lesson topic. What is the context of 1 Samuel
8:1-9?
   There are various contexts out of which Bible writers inform us of
God's will. First, there is the actual historical setting in which the
Bible passage was written.
   To understand this setting of a text, we must first try to discover
the time when the text was written and the culture and society out of
which the story arose. For example, 1 Samuel 8:1-9 is set at the time
when Israel wanted a king. The surrounding countries all had mon-
archs who ruled them. The children of Israel pressed Samuel to
appoint for them a ruler who would give them standing with other
nations and fight their battles for them.

   "A great deal of research into the nature of kingship has been
carried out in recent years. It is now recognized that in the ancient
world generally, kingship was sacral—a sacred, cultic office as well
as a political position. The king was, in fact, universally acknowl-
edged as a mediator between god(s) and people. This inevitably led
to his being considered at least a semidivine person. In Egypt, in-
deed, the king was accorded full divine honors; he was a god in
human form. In Babylonia, on the other hand, the king was recog-
nized as a human being, elevated to near-divine status. . . . Despite
the differences, in both areas the king was pivotal in the cultic beliefs
and practices. No doubt the Canaanites followed a similar pattern; in
the Ras Shamrah tablets the Canaanite king Keret (Kirta, Kirtu) is
styled both the 'servant of [the deity] El' and the 'son of El.'. . . It is
specifically stated in 1 S. 8:5 that when the Israelites felt they should
have a king, they were influenced by the practices of neighboring
peoples."—D. F. Payne, The International Standard Bible Encyclo-
pedia (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1986), vol. 3, p. 21.

   Historical information helps us to understand what the text
said to those who read it. What do you think it would have been
like living without a king in the time of the prophets?


   Books that assist us in determining the historical setting of a
passage include: Bible commentaries, dictionaries, encyclopedias,
concordances, and introductions to the Old and New Testaments.
Some Bibles have introductions to each book that give helpful back-
ground information.

LEARNING HOW TO ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS (1 Cor.
2:14-3:4).

   Learning to ask the right questions is crucial. A learned professor
of theology grew up with his mother and father asking him each
evening before mealtime what he had learned in school that day.
When the professor became an adult and had his own family, he
decided this question was inappropriate because it encouraged chil-
dren to respond simply, "Oh, nothing." Instead, he decided to ask his
children, "What good questions did you ask today?" This allowed
them to develop analytical thinking skills that would help them
understand their world. There is a high correlation between spiritual
maturity and the ability to think logically about one's faith.
   Adventist youth are sometimes critical of the church because they
sense a lack of openness to question and to analytical thinking. But
we know that a strong thinking climate is correlated positively with a
warm church climate. Most members want to be challenged to think
about religious issues and ideas, and they want to examine their faith
carefully in order to learn and to grow in understanding. Learning to
ask deep, thoughtful questions helps in this process.

   After reading 1 Corinthians 2:14-3:4, write out two ques-
tions, the answers to which would help you understand the pas-
sage.

Question 1:


Question 2:



  Here are some suggested questions about the passage that,
when answered, will help you to understand it:

   1. To what four types of people does Paul introduce us in this
      passage?

   2. What kind of understanding is "spiritual" understanding?

   3. Can infants in Christ instantly become spiritual by asking the
      Spirit to fill them? What of the "solid" food that is required of
      mature Christians?

   4. Can we be spiritually disabled? If so, how?

                                                                     25
Wednesday                                          January 17
LEARNING TO USE THE IMMEDIATE CONTEXT (John 3:1-
21).

    Another step in understanding Scripture is to become sensitive to
the immediate context, the setting of the passage in the scriptural
material. This concern may not appear to be much of a problem for
some texts. For example, passages like the following seem quite
clear: "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Rom.
3:23, NIV); "Live by the Spirit" (Gal. 5:16, NIV). But even simple
passages can be understood more clearly if we become sensitive to
immediate context. Here the tools for Bible study can become impor-
tant.
   Read several times the verses in front of and after the passage
being studied to grasp the immediate setting or context.

   Using John 3 as the basis for your study today, ask the follow-
ing contextual questions about the passage. If you don't know
the answers, use one of your reference tools to help you under-
stand:
   1. What was the occasion of the story?
   2. Who was the man coming to Jesus at night? What did he think
      of Jesus? What questions did he ask, and why did he want to
      know the answers? What were his concerns? What was he
      failing to recognize?
   3. What attitude did Jesus show toward the questioner?
   4. What are the logical sections in the story?
   5. What is the main point of the story? (John 3:16). Why is this
      an answer to the question of new birth?

  Some principles that help us to understand the "context" of a
Bible passage are as follows:
  1. Always try to discover what the historical and cultural setting
     of the text was.
  2. Learn to think in paragraphs. These are natural units of thought.
     You need to understand the content of the paragraph and why
     this particular thing is said at this particular time and place.
  3. See whether the context supports your understanding of the
     passage.
  4. Notice the literary style of the passage—poetry, history, psalm,
     parable, prophecy, etc. How does this help your understanding
     of the passage?

   Exercise in context: read Romans 10:4 in various transla-
tions. How does the context (Rom. 9:30-10:10) help us to
understand this passage?

TOOLS FOR BIBLE STUDY (1 Sam. 8:16; 1 Cor. 11:29).

   The Bible was originally written in three different languages:
Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. While most of the Old Testament was
written in Hebrew and a small portion in Aramaic, all of the New
Testament was written in Greek. Most of us do not know these
languages, and so we must rely upon someone else's translation of
the original. To some extent, reading a translation is like reading an
interpretation, and that is not all bad in itself.
   Using only one translation has the disadvantage that one's under-
standing of God's Word is limited to the meanings in that one
translation. The version you are using may translate some passages
well but others less well. That is why using more than one translation
may be a great help in understanding the Bible. Of course, you must
select quality translations.
   If you have them available, use a number of translations to
compare important Bible passages, such as Genesis 1:1-10, John 3:16,
and Revelation 14:1-5, and the two texts listed above, 1 Samuel 8:16
and 1 Corinthians 11:29. We suggest that English readers use the
New International Version (NIV), the Revised Standard Version
(RSV), the King James Version (KJV), and the New King James
Version (NKJV) as examples. Note that the message is clearer in
some translations than in others.
   Discuss the relative benefits of using a newer translation. Note
that scholarship often has improved over the years and that more
modern Bibles contain more accurate information based on his-
torical and archaeological research.

   Some rules for selecting a good translation:
   1. Pick a translation rather than a paraphrase. Translations
      reflect the original text and are more accurate representations
      of the actual language.
   2. Avoid translations that present a prejudiced viewpoint.
      Some translations present a denominational bias rather than
      reliance on original manuscripts.
   3. Try to use a version prepared by a committee. Such ver-
      sions are usually less biased and more faithful to the original.
      A more literal translation is useful for serious study.
   4. Try to use a Bible that involves the latest scholarship. This
      will give you information that older versions do not have. For
      example, the Dead Sea Scrolls material was discovered in the
      late 1940s, and only versions that were published after that
      date make use of this early biblical material.
   5. Use a Bible that nurtures your spiritual life. For devotional
      purposes, one can use a modern translation that is easy to read.

                                                                    27
Friday                                              January 19
FURTHER STUDY: There are many New Testament stories that
provide spiritual insight concerning the nature of God's kingdom but
are best understood when they are seen in their Middle Eastern
context. For example, the story of Zacchaeus the tax collector in
Luke 19:1-9. To understand this passage, it is useful to learn about
the tax collector's profession in New Testament times. In addition, to
understand the story itself, it is necessary to see the double meaning
in verse 9. Salvation refers both to Jesus in person and to the experi-
ence Zacchaeus was to have that would change his behavior.
   It is also important to note that this story occurred near the end of
Jesus' ministry. What stories precede and follow it? The next part in
the story is Jesus' ascent to Jerusalem, where His ministry ended
when He provided for the salvation of the whole world by dying on
the cross.

   If you have a Bible commentary and dictionary, look up the
following terms: tax collector, Jericho, salvation. Try to under-
stand Zacchaeus better after learning about these terms.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How can the cultural issues of the first century (i.e., politi-
     cal groups, Sabbath laws, rabbinical practices, etc.) influ-
     ence one's understanding of a text?

     2. How does understanding the geography of the Bible times
        improve our understanding of a text?

     3. What was going on in Corinth that caused Paul to write to
        the church in this city? What was going on in Rome that
        led Paul to write the Epistle to the Romans? How does
        knowing these things enhance our understanding of Paul's
        letters to Corinth and Rome?

     4. Why do God's messages to first-century Christians have
        definite relevance to you?

SUMMARY: A contextual approach to Bible passages we are en-
deavoring to understand involves: (1) seeking an understanding of
the cultural setting in which the passage was written; (2) considering
the larger context of the passage within the book in which it occurs;
(3) determining the true meaning of a passage in its immediate
context; (4) learning something of the mood of a passage or a book.
By thinking about the context of a passage under study, we catch a
glimpse of the feelings and motivations of the biblical authors or
characters.

                 Breakthrough in Pakistan

              Reinder Bruinsma and Andrea Steele


    More than 100 new Adventists were baptized in Karachi, Paki-
stan, on a single Sabbath last year. Most of the new believers
traced their new faith to evangelistic meetings held in several
towns and villages near Karachi. Local pastors followed up the
interests of the evangelistic meetings and prepared the candidates
for baptism. The group gathered at the open-air baptistry behind
Karachi Adventist Hospital to witness their faith.
    In a country in which 98 percent of the population is Muslim,
the 100 baptisms represent a significant increase in membership.
Since 1985 the church in Pakisitan has doubled in size, from 5,000
to 10,000 members.
    Public evangelism in Pakistan is restricted to the "Christian"
community, which comprises only two to three percent of the total
population. Many of these nominal Christians live in the poorest
areas of Pakistan. Plans are being laid to reach as many of these
areas as possible through evangelism.
    One pastor who joined in the baptismal celebration was Dr.
Borge Schantz, director of the Islamic Institute, located on the
campus of Newbold College. He had held an evangelistic series in
Thatta, a town a few hours' drive from Karachi, and several of the
new believers had come from that effort. Dr. Schantz was in
Pakistan to prepare for another evangelistic series.
    Recently Adventist World Radio has begun broadcasting one
hour a day in Urdu, the official language of Pakistan. Programs
 are produced in the Pakistan Union offices in Lahore.
    Studies by the British Broadcasting Company indicate that
 nearly half of all households in Pakistan have a radio, and most of
 these have short-wave capabilities. The study also indicates that
 radio owners in villages tend to share their radios with neighbors
 and friends. This, coupled with a low literacy rate in the country,
 makes radio the communication medium of choice for evange-
 lism.

   Reinder Bruinsma is communication director for the
Trans-European Division. Andrea Steele is public relations
director for Adventist World Radio.

  Discovery Through Study,
   Prayer, and Meditation




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Psalms 1; 86; 119:1-24;
2 Tim. 2:7.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Open my eyes that I may see wonderful
     things in your law" (Psalm 119:18, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Often as we work to learn the original situa-
tion and meaning of a text, we forget that the deepest understanding
comes as a gift from God. We are not finished with our study until we
have received a blessing from God and personal direction for our
lives. Therefore, we must immerse ourselves not only in the text of
the Bible but in meditation and prayer. Only then can we receive the
insights needed to apply Scripture to specific areas of our lives.

   WHY WE NEED PRAYER AND MEDITATION. "Those who
will put on the whole armor of God and devote some time every day
to meditation and prayer and to the study of the Scriptures will be
connected with heaven and will have a saving, transforming influ-
ence upon those around them. Great thoughts, noble aspirations,
clear perceptions of truth and duty to God, will be theirs. They will
be yearning for purity, for light, for love, for all the graces of
heavenly birth. . . .
   "Abstract meditation is not enough; busy action is not enough;
both are essential to the formation of Christian character."—Testimo-
nies for the Church, vol. 5, pp. 112, 113.
   "Let the student keep his Bible always with him and, as he has
opportunity, read a text and meditate upon it."—Counsels to Parents,
Teachers, and Students, p. 463.

PRAYER AND BIBLE STUDY (Psalms 1; 119:1-24).

    The Bible writers seem to have thrived on deep meditation on the
words of the Bible. For David the shepherd-king, meditation was a
regular practice (Ps. 1:1, 2). "Oh, how I love your law! I meditate on
it all day long. Your commands make me wiser than my enemies, for
they are ever with me. I have more insight than all my teachers, for I
meditate on your statutes" (Ps. 119:97-99, NIV).
    The text implies significant time commitment to the process of
prayer and meditation ("all day long"). If we are to receive the
biblical blessing of wisdom and insight as the psalm suggests, we
must begin to make considerable changes in our commitment to
prayer and meditation.

   What does 2 Timothy 2:7 suggest about the process of receiv-
ing insight into God's will? How does thinking over what God
says help us to understand His will for our lives?


   What happens when we think about what we read in the Bible?
First, as we begin to examine our lives, the problems and challenges
become clearer. This process allows the Word of God to make sense
for us. We can find answers to those areas of our lives that need
special help. Next, we can ask how the particular Bible truth we are
examining affects our relationship with God. How does the Bible
information make a difference in our lives?
   Here is a personal meditation exercise:
   1. Read Psalm 119:1-24 a few times. Ask yourself what direction
       the text suggests for your life.
   2. What information about God does this text suggest?
   3. Think how following the counsel in this passage might change
       your life or behavior.
   4. What insights did you receive into your life's needs? Finish
       the sentence "This text shows me that . . ."
   5. Memorize passages that are helpful to your spiritual life. (See
       Counsels on Sabbath School Work, p. 42.)

   "God bids us fill the mind with great thoughts, pure thoughts. He
desires us to meditate upon His love and mercy, to study His wonder-
ful work in the great plan of redemption. Then clearer and still clearer
will be our perception of truth, higher, holier our desire for purity of
heart and clearness of thought."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 60.

   Is meditation only one-way communication? How does God
 communicate with us through this process?

                                                                     31

PRAYER AND INSIGHT (Ps. 119:18).

   Understanding the meaning of a Bible passage requires prayer.
"Take the Bible as a study book, and see if you are not filled with the
love of God. Your heart may be barren, your intellect feeble; but if
you will prayerfully study the word of God, light will flash into your
mind."—Counsels to Parents, Teachers, and Students, pp. 455, 456.
   Without fellowship with God, our thinking may make us worldly-
minded secularists, skeptics, or atheists. We must learn to study the
Bible prayerfully. One purpose of prayer is to open us up to God's
direction. Prayer prepares our hearts for further dialogue with, and
insight from, God.

   What does Psalm 119:18 suggest will happen when we begin to
include God in our study?


   It is said, "Application begins on our knees." Prayer, in relation to
Bible study, enables us to see a natural connection between God's
Word and our quest for direction and growth in Christ:
  1. As we pray, we come to recognize the distance we are from
      God. Our prayers begin to focus on those things we must learn
      and do. Thus our appreciation of God's gift of grace is en-
      hanced. (See Ps. 34:4-7.)
  2. As we look at our problems, God helps us to see alternatives
      and provides strength to overcome in those areas of our lives
      in which His gifts are indispensable. (See Isa. 46:4; Jer. 1:8;
      2 Cor. 1:9, 10.)
  3. We ask God to show us our hardness and rebellion and to
      change us. (See Ps. 139:23, 24.)

   Another function of prayer is to return to God praise for His
goodness and love to us (Ps. 106:1, 2). Prayer is an act of worship.
Thoughtful prayer is the beginning of the meditation that leads to
spiritual growth.
   "The Bible should never be studied without prayer. The Holy
Spirit alone can cause us to feel the importance of those things easy
to be understood, or prevent us from wresting truths difficult of
comprehension. It is the office of heavenly angels to prepare the
heart so to comprehend God's word that we shall be charmed with its
beauty, admonished by its warnings, or animated and strengthened
by its promises."—Counsels on Sabbath School Work, pp. 38, 39.
   Deep meditation helps our faith development. God invites us all to
experience trust and fellowship and to meet Him at special moments
during the day. Meditation helps us to meet God in a personal way.

ILLUSTRATIONS OF MEDITATION (Dan. 9:1-23).

   Scripture speaks of many people who found insight into God's
will through proper meditation. Christian meditation prepares the
believer to participate in Christ's ministry of saving souls. Unchris-
tian meditation evacuates the mind of God-inspired thought and
makes it a slave to the destroyer of souls.
   Looking at the context of Daniel 9, we discover four major in-
sights: (1) Daniel had repeated visions of the rise and fall of nations
and of the sufferings of God's people (Daniel 7, 8); (2) Daniel had
been told of delay in God's action against evil in the world (2300
days of:years; Dan. 8:14); (3) Daniel was concerned about this delay.
He attempted to understand God's will for His people as outlined in
the prophecy (Dan. 8:27); (4) the 70 years of Israel's exile were
nearly over (Dan. 9:1, 2). Now Daniel turned to prayer, meditation,
information, insight, and relief.

   Read Daniel 9:1-19, and note how many times he talks about
understanding, insight, and prayer. What answers did God give
in response to Daniel's persistence? Dan. 9:20-24.


   The history of the church provides numerous case studies of the
power of prayer and meditation. One example is John Woolman, an
eighteenth-century Quaker, who through the study of the Bible be-
came convinced of the evils of slavery. His prayer and meditation on
the Word of God convinced him never to own slaves. Through his
devotion to Scripture, he became convicted of many biblical truths.
    Another deeply spiritual person is John Stott, the rector emeritus
of All Souls Church in London. Along with such spiritual giants as
H. M. S. Richards, Sr., in our own denomination, Dr. Stott provides a
contemporary model. Stott tells of doing as much of his sermon
preparation as possible on his knees with his Bible open before him.
He prays as he studies. He explains that this is not because he
worships the Bible, but because he worships the God of the Bible, and
he desires to humble himself before Him and His revelation. While he
is studying the text of Scripture, he is praying earnestly that his mind
will be enlightened with divine insights. (See John Stott, Between Two
Worlds [Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1982], p. 222.)

 on the Word of God have helped your church, your family, or
 you personally? Identify other Bible characters who thrived
 spiritually through prayer and meditation.

THE HOLY SPIRIT AND GROWTH (Psalms 66:18,19; 90).

   One of the Holy Spirit's functions in our lives is to guide us. God
wishes us to know His will and promises us wisdom when we ask
(James 1:5, 6). An additional function of the Holy Spirit is to convict
us to do right and to avoid wrong (John 16:8). The Holy Spirit
prepares and enlightens us and makes us open to what God is saying
to us through the Bible.
   As we begin to open our minds to God's messages in the Bible,
our manner of thinking is changed. Now that the Spirit is directing
us, we begin to see the world and others in an entirely different light.
Perhaps you have observed someone who has been struggling with
life's problems become changed through the power of the Holy
Spirit. A critical person is now gentle and sensitive; a rude person is
now courteous and tactful, a selfish person is now able to place
others first. This results from the power of the Spirit fulfilling the
promise in John 3: "The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its
sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going.
So it is with everyone born of the Spirit" (John 3:8, NIV). Positive
spiritual results indicate the Spirit's presence in our lives.

    According to Psalm 66:18, 19, what do we need in order to be
prepared to receive God? How do we know that the Spirit of God
is present in our lives? Rom. 8:16; 1 John 3:24; 4:12, 13; 5:10.
List ways in which the church might show evidence of the power
of the Spirit of God in its midst.


   "The diligent, humble student, seeking by earnest prayer and
study for the truth as it is in Jesus, will most assuredly be rewarded.
He seeks for help, not from ideas of human writers, but from the
Fountain of wisdom and knowledge; and under the guidance of holy
intelligences he gains a clear understanding of truth."—Gospel Workers,
p. 251.

  Study Psalm 90, and reflect on the following questions to
personalize the passage:
  1. What actions of God are found in this passage?

     2. What happens to us in God's presence?

     3. What qualities can be developed by communion with God?

     4. What understanding of God can we develop through fellow-
        ship with Him?

DISCOVERING TRUTH (Matt. 11:25, 26; John 7:17).

   Not only do Christians need to pray and meditate on the Word of
God; they must be actively involved in the pursuit of truth. While
prayer and meditation prepare our hearts to receive the blessings
from God's treasure store, there must also be a commitment to
discover truth. We must make personal decisions about the impor-
tance of God's Word in our lives, and we must take the necessary
steps toward an understanding of Scripture.
   There are some steps that the Bible suggests are important in this
process:
   1. We must approach the Bible with an open, teachable mind.
      (See Matt. 11:25, 26.) Jesus says that some things have been
      hidden from sophisticated learners. He upheld the model of
       the childlike learner to illustrate the appropriate attitude in
       Bible study.
   2. We must invite the Holy Spirit to actively assist our efforts to
       gain insights into God's will. (See John 16:13.)
   3. We must be willing to live consistently with what we learn in
       God's Word. This learning involves vital discovery of His
       will for our lives. (See John 7:17.)

   Jesus urged that one way to learn about prayer is to pray without
ceasing. (See Matt. 26:41; 1 Thess. 5:17.) Many people would rather
discuss the theory or theology of prayer than attempt to engage in it.
But Jesus taught that one way to learn about prayer is to immerse
oneself in it. The same is true for Bible study. We learn about study
only by trying it; we learn about the power of Christ only by living a
Christ-filled life.
   "How shall we search the Scriptures in order to understand what
they teach? We should come to the investigation of God's word with
a contrite heart, a teachable and prayerful spirit. We are not to think,
as did the Jews, that our own ideas and opinions are infallible. . . . We
should not study the Bible for the purpose of sustaining our precon-
ceived opinions, but with the single object of learning what God has
said."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 105.

    List the attitudes that should accompany the study of God's
 Word. Being aware of your fallen human nature, think about
 the hindrances that obscure your seeing and doing what God
 shows you in Scripture. What are some things that you need to
 do to discover God's truth for yourself? How willing are you to
 surrender your own preconceived ideas regarding the teach-
 ings of God's Word? (See Prov. 2:3-7; 14:12; John 17:17.)


                                                                      35
Friday                                               January 26
FURTHER STUDY: A close reliance on God's revelation regarding
Himself and conformity to the commands of His Word exemplified
by Old and New Testament characters provide us the means of
success in our religious lives. Study Hebrews 11. Look closely at the
following individuals, and explore the reasons for their spiritual
success: Enoch, Abraham, Moses, Rahab, and Joseph. How did each
of these characters relate to God? What attitudes helped them dis-
cover truth and learn God's will for their lives?
   Read "The Call of Abraham" and "Joseph in Egypt" in Patri-
archs and Prophets, pp. 125-131; 213-223; "John Wycliffe" in
The Great Controversy, pp. 79-96.

    "The character of Wycliffe is a testimony to the educating, trans-
forming power of the Holy Scriptures. It was the Bible that made him
what he was. The effort to grasp the great truths of revelation imparts
freshness and vigor to all the faculties. It expands the mind, sharpens
the perceptions, and ripens the judgment. The study of the Bible will
ennoble every thought, feeling, and aspiration as no other study can.
It gives stability of purpose, patience, courage, and fortitude; it
refines the character and sanctifies the soul."—The Great Contro-
versy, p. 94.
    "The Bible is like a fountain. The more you look into it, the deeper
it appears. The grand truths of sacred history possess amazing strength
and beauty, and are as far-reaching as eternity. No science is equal to
the science that reveals the character of God."—Fundamentals of
Christian Education, p. 393.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Does all truth lead us closer to Jesus? Explain.

     2. What do you believe is involved in changing your view-
        point? How does a deep study of God's Word assist you in
        this process?

     3. What characteristics possessed by the people mentioned in
        Hebrews 11 do many contemporary Christians lack? Which
        do you find lacking in your own life?

     4. What is more important, being right or being loving? Is
        either, one indispensable?

SUMMARY: The Holy Spirit enables us to discover truth in the
Scriptures as we pray, meditate, and study. God wishes us to be
committed to these spiritual disciplines as part of living by faith in
Him.

                    A God Stronger Than Idols-1
                                 Sven H. Jensen

           Biel and Majiok are Sudanese young men who have a burden to
       share the Adventist message with the people of their home town,
       many of whom are idol worshipers. They returned to their village
       of Waat in southern Sudan and began contacting the few Adventists
       living there. They organized the group and began building a simple
       church. Next the group laid plans for sharing the Adventist mes-
       sage with the local population.
           One day Biel and Majiok found a sick man resting outside their
       home. They asked how they could help him and offered to visit
       him. The man gladly told them where his toukel [home] was.
           The two young men visited the sick man. As their eyes became
       accustomed to the darkness, they noticed five idols placed in a
       corner of the room. The idol gods were made from decorated
       gourds, and each had a name: Kuoth Kier the river god, Koltok the
       god in the tree, Biel the stone god, Kolang the god in the gourd,
       and Garang, the powerful god of the heavens. These gods had
       been in the man's family for generations; they were venerated
       with sacrifices and used for fortune telling. The man feared the
       powerful spirits that inhabited the idols, for he believed they could
       bring disaster upon the family if their needs were not satisfied.
       Garang, the god of heaven, demanded the head of a cow on a stake
       for his sacrifice.
            Biel and Majiok smiled, opened their New Testament, and read
       of another God--the God who knew their names and who wanted
       only their love, not animal sacrifices. The sick man and his family
        listened attentively. Gatwich, the sick man's brother-in-law, was
       grateful that these two men had come to visit his sister's husband
       and bring the family hope.
            Biel and Majiok returned often and soon began studying the
        Bible with this family. Nyatuach, the man's wife, was especially
        interested. Slowly she began to give up her traditional beliefs. But
        before she had surrendered her life to Jesus, her husband died. Her
        mind was in a turmoil. According to custom, she must call the
        relatives together and sacrifice a bull. Then her husband's prop-
        erty could be divided, and she would be given to one of her
        husband's brothers. She hesitated to follow this tradition, but she
        knew that she would be accused of wrongdoing if she did not
        follow traditions to honor her late husband. What could she do?

         Understanding Types
          of Bible Literature




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Mark 4:10-12; Matthew
24.

     MEMORY TEXT: "You were taught, with regard to your
     former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being
     corrupted by its deceitful desires; to be made new in the
     attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to
     be like God in true righteousness and holiness" (Ephesians
     4:22-24, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: God has revealed Himself in the Bible through
various kinds of literature. In order to understand and to apply God's
messages, we need to know something about these kinds of literature.

    LEARNING ABOUT BIBLE LITERATURE. The sacred text
contains many kinds of material or types of writing. Sometimes the
Bible gives us insight into the history of God's people. At other times
it presents commands and laws. Many times, in the inspirational
words of the Old Testament poets, God's character comes to us in
beautiful words of symbol and praise. At other times the purpose of
the Bible words is direct spiritual instruction. Divine counsel may be
prophetic in nature and may seem somewhat obscure or hidden. At
other times this counsel is in the form of letters to a blossoming
young church learning to face the challenges of spiritual growth in
the face of cultural pressures, doctrinal divisions, and the need to
prepare for the Lord's coming.
    This week we will explore four types of literature in God's Word
and learn how better to understand and apply the text to our own
situations. We will look at parables, poetry, prophecy, and history.

Sunday                                              January 28
PARABLES—DO YOU GET THE POINT? (Luke 10:25-37).

  Why did Jesus teach in parables? Mark 4:10-12; Matt. 13:10-
13; Luke 8:9, 10.


   The Greek word translated "parable" (parabole, Mark 4:10) means
"comparison," "type," "figure." A New Testament parable is a short
discourse designed to illustrate spiritual truth by comparison with the
known world. A parable is something that is placed alongside some-
thing else for the purpose of comparison and edification. Jesus taught
in parables because spiritual things are "spiritually discerned"
(1 Cor. 2:14). God gave genuine seekers for truth an understanding
of Jesus' parables. Others "on the outside" (Mark 4:11, NIV) could
not understand, because they did not submit to the teaching ministry
of the Holy Spirit. Parables enable Spirit-directed Bible students to
understand complex issues in a practical, life-related way.

   Read the story of the good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37). Deter-
mine why Jesus told this story and to whom He addressed it.
Discover the story's major theme. Identify the people in the
story, and identify their spiritual problem or attribute. What in
this story shows you what the grace of God is like?


   The parable of the good Samaritan obviously has double mean-
ings. Throughout history this style of writing was considered impor-
tant in the teaching ministry of the church. There are differences
between true parables, such as the good Samaritan, and allegories,
which need some interpretive key in order to understand them. The
parable of the good Samaritan is a story, pure and simple, with a
beginning and an ending. (See The Desire of Ages, pp. 499, 503.) It
has a plot just like other story parables, such as the lost sheep, the
prodigal son, and the great supper.
   Here are some rules for understanding parables:
   1. Often understanding the audience helps us to understand the
      parable. (Here is contextual understanding again.)
   2. Read the parable aloud to get the full impact of the story.
      What catches your attention first?
   3. Often parables answer a question or a problem. What is the
      question Jesus is trying to answer? (Luke 10:25-29).
   4. Parables teach a truth to the hearer. What is the truth in the
       parable of the good Samaritan?
   5. Parables often confront us with our sinful self or clarify spir-
       itual truth for us.

                                                                     39
Monday                                              January 29
POETRY—HEARING GOD'S GRACE (Psalms 19, 86).

   The book of Psalms is a collection of inspired prayers, poetry, and
hymns. They are best understood when we recognize that they were
written by Hebrews in Hebrew. In Bible poetry the words are from
God to us or are spoken to God, or about God, by dedicated, inspired
people—men and women who burst forth in praise as they thought of
God. These inspired words bring hope and joy to our hearts and meet
our deepest spiritual needs.

    What is your favorite psalm? Why? How does it meet your
spiritual needs? Read Psalm 86, and describe the picture of God
it portrays. How does knowing God's character of love and grace
help us to identify our spiritual and personal needs?


   "Every part of the Bible is given by inspiration of God, and is
profitable. The Old Testament, no less than the New, should receive
attention. As we study the Old Testament, we shall find living springs
bubbling up where the careless reader discerns only a desert."—Lift
Him Up, p. 115.
   What to remember when studying the psalms or poetic books
of the Bible:
    1. Remember that these words are written as Hebrew poetry and
       addressed to God from the heart, through the mind. See, for
       example, Psalm 19:1 (NIV). Notice how the NIV has tried to
       help us see the parallels in this psalm by capitalizing only the
       first line in each and using a semicolon between the two lines.
       What is the poet's main point? The second line in Hebrew
       poetry often parallels the first line in meaning (Prov. 18:15).
       Sometimes the thought in the second line contrasts with the
       first (Prov. 10:19; 15:1).
   2. Most of the psalms were poetry set to music.
   3. The vocabulary of a poem often has double meanings upon
       which we can meditate. God's work is illustrated when the
       psalm discussing the Exodus says that the mountains "skipped
       like rams" (Ps. 114:4, NIV).
   4. There are many types of poetry in the Bible. These types may
       be laments, expressions of thanksgiving, appeals for help, or
       expressions of joy and praise. When reading a psalm, clarify
       the type, and your understanding will increase.

  Look up the following psalms, and try to identify their types:
Psalms 127, 139, 137. What pictures of God and His grace do
you see?

PROPHECY—LEARNING GOD'S PLAN (Rev. 3:14-21).

   Prophetic literature comprises a large portion of the Bible. Proph-
ecy may be general or apocalyptic. General prophecy (for example,
Joel, Isaiah, Jeremiah) speaks to a local historical situation, often
using this situation as a type or analogy of a similar situation that will
arise toward the end of time. (Note, for example, the dual application
of Jeremiah 4.) Apocalyptic prophecy (for example, Daniel and Rev-
elation) has three major characteristics: (1) It is based on visions and
dreams. (2) It makes a large use of symbolism. (3) It focuses on the
end time.
   Prophecy is often prediction. But it often involves understanding
the past, for many of the prophecies have been fulfilled already. So
the study of prophetic books often involves a study of world history.

  How do we know we have interpreted a prophecy correctly?
Consider the implication of these verses for our interpretation of
prophecy: Isa. 8:20; Jer. 28:9; 2 Peter 1:19-21; John 16:13.


   The books of Daniel and Revelation often present predictions of
the future in symbolic language. These prophetic messages have
undoubtedly been an encouragement to God's people throughout
history, but, because of their focus on the end-time, they contain a
special message for us. They have deep spiritual overtones, designed
to influence our spiritual preparation for Christ's second advent.
Note that each of the messages to the churches contained in Revela-
tion 2 and 3 applies, in a special sense, to God's last-day people.

  Some principles to remember when interpreting prophetic
passages of the Bible:
  1. Ask three questions of the passage: (1) Why was the prophecy
     given? (2) What did it mean to those who heard it at the time it
     was written? (3) What does it mean to us today? (What prin-
     ciples arise from the text that apply to our situation? See Rev.
     3:14-21.)
  2. See whether the text explains itself. Often if we would just
     read farther in the passage, we would find the interpretation
     to be self-evident. (See Dan. 7:23-25.)
  3. Consider whether there were historical events at the time the
     prophecy was written that explain its meaning. If not, look
     beyond that period of history for clues. (See Rev. 14:6-12.)
  4. Study the use of symbols elsewhere in Scripture,, and apply
     your findings to the prophecy.


                                                                        41
Wednesday                                            January 31
THE PROPHECY OF MATTHEW 24 (Matt. 24:1-31).

   Now let us apply the principles stated in Tuesday's lesson to
Jesus' prophecy of the fall of Jerusalem and the end of the world
(Matthew 24).

  Why was the prophecy given? What two questions was Jesus
addressing? Matt. 24:1-3.


   A correct interpretation of the prophecy depends on our under-
standing that Jesus was using the events leading up to and including
the fall of Jerusalem in A.D. 70 as a type or analogy of the events
leading up to and including His second advent. Consequently, Jesus'
description of the fall of Jerusalem is also a description of His second
coming. History will be repeated. The historical events prior to and
including the events of A.D. 70 illustrate what will happen at the end
of time.
   "Jesus did not answer His disciples by taking up separately the
destruction of Jerusalem and the great day of His coming. He mingled
the description of these two events. Had He opened to His disciples
future events as He beheld them, they would have been unable to
endure the sight. In mercy to them He blended the description of the
two great crises, leaving the disciples to study out the meaning for
themselves. When He referred to the destruction of Jerusalem, His
prophetic words reached beyond that event to the final conflagration
in that day when the Lord shall rise out of His place to punish the
world for their iniquity, when the earth shall disclose her blood, and
shall no more cover her slain. The entire discourse was given, not for
the disciples only, but for those who should live in the last scenes of
this earth's history."—The Desire of Ages, p. 628.

   Applying this principle of interpretation, what did the follow-
ing predictions mean to the disciples? How were they fulfilled
before and during A.D. 70? How may they apply to the events
prior to and during the second coming of Jesus?
   1. Matt. 24:4-7. False Christs, wars and rumors of wars,
      famines, earthquakes.
   2. Matt. 24:9-14. Persecution, apostasy and disloyalty, false
      prophets, the gospel preached in all the world.
   3. Matt. 24:15-31. "The abomination that causes desolation"
      (NIV), fleeing from the enemy, observance of the Sabbath
      (verse 20), the time of trouble, the dark day, and the falling
      stars (verse 29; compare Joel 2:30-32).

HISTORY, INFORMATION, AND INSIGHT (2 Chronicles 27;
Mark 7).

   Much of the Old Testament and some of the New Testament are
historical in nature. The challenge is to understand the historical
setting of the text and to transfer the Bible principles to our situation
today. God is revealed through the history of His people. Historical
books include Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and
2 Kings, the four Gospels, and Acts.

   What other books would you consider to be mainly historical
in nature? What are the main points in the historical account in
2 Chronicles 27?

   "Written in different ages, by men who differed widely in rank
and occupation, and in mental and spiritual endowments, the books
of the Bible present a wide contrast in style, as well as a diversity in
the nature of the subjects unfolded. Different forms of expression are
employed by different writers; often the same truth is more strikingly
presented by one than by another."—The Great Controversy, p. vi.

  What are the benefits of seeing the truth presented in different
ways by different authors in the Bible? (Read the introduction to
The Great Controversy, and identify Ellen G. White's position.)

  Biblical narratives describe what happened in the lives of God's
people. Does this mean that they suggest what should happen in the
church today?
  Here are some principles of interpretation that are helpful in
understanding Bible history:
   1. Ask, What is the general historical situation facing the author
      and the audience? Seek understanding of the political, eco-
      nomic, and social situations.
   2. Identify the customs of the times. (See Mark 7 and the word
      corban [verse 11]. How does an understanding of this expres-
      sion help us to understand the passage?)
   3. Is the passage giving us descriptive and prescriptive truth?
      Descriptive truth tells us what happened and what God said.
      Prescriptive truth states divine principles.
   4. Always seek God's guidance in understanding the history and
      in finding spiritual applications then and now.
   5. Remember, God does not approve everything the Bible records.
      God inspired the record of historical events, but He was not
      responsible for the bad things people did or the bad results
      from their actions.

                                                                       43
Friday                                             February 2
FURTHER STUDY: Study the following historical passages: Judges
7:1-8, Gideon defeats the Midianites; Num. 35:6-33, cities of refuge;
Acts 2:1-13, the Holy Spirit comes at Pentecost. Make the following
observations:
   1. Why is each passage in the Bible? What is its purpose?
   2. What are the religious characteristics of each person in the
      stories?
   3. What spiritual lessons apply to our lives today?
   4. What do you learn about the character of God?

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How can commands given by God to one people in one
     culture be translated into our culture?

     2. Can we make direct application from all the incidents that
        the Bible directly censures or approves?

     3. What do you think of this statement: "Express commands
        to individuals are not always the will of God for us"? (For
        example, Abraham was told to offer up his son.)

SUMMARY: The Bible was written in a number of literary forms.
Four of these are parables, poetry, prophecy, and history. Parables
elucidate truth for believers, poetry expresses eternal principles in
beautiful language, prophecy reveals the hand of God in history and
at the end of time, and history illustrates God's dealings with His
people.
   Since more than 40 percent of our Bible is historical, we are able
to consider the importance of biblical examples in our walk of faith.

Mabel Minim
                    A God Stronger than Idols-2
                                Sven H. Jensen

          Nyatuach is a widow in Sudan. When her husband died, custom
      demanded that she sacrifice a bull in her husband's honor. Then
      the family will divide her husband's possessions, and she will be
      given to one of her husband's brothers.
          But recently two young men have told her about the God of
      heaven, and she has begun to give up traditional beliefs, including
      faith in the demanding idols her husband kept in their home. But if
      she does not sacrifice the bull in her husband's honor, his family
      will blame her if anything bad happens to them. What should she
      do?
          She sought counsel from Biel and Majiok, who had taught her
      about Jesus. They challenged her to trust in Jesus and not follow
      the pagan customs of her relatives. They assured her that the idol
      gods had no power over her if she trusted in Jesus.
          Biel's family invited Widow Nyatuach and her children into
      their own home. When nothing bad happened to her husband's
      family, they left her alone. Her brother, Gatwich, was impressed
      by the love and kindness of these Adventist Christians and began
      regular Bible studies. One day Gatwich brought his family to the
      tiny church. "We want to follow Jesus," he said. He carried his
      own gods and the five that had belonged to his sister's husband. In
      the presence of church members Gatwich destroyed and buried the
       idols. His sister asked fearfully, "If we bury them, will they come
       back again and disturb us?"
          Biel answered, "If your heart is still with the idols, they will
       come back to trouble you. But if your heart is with Jesus the idols
       will never come back."
          Six months later I flew into Waat on a UN relief flight, the first
       time ever that a pastor had visited the village. I baptized the three
       former idol worshipers: Gatwich, his sister Nyatuach, and her 15-
       year-old son, Mayiar, and several others, in a small pool of water
       one hour's walk from the town. Mayiar said on the day of his
       baptism, "I couldn't sleep all night for joy."
          Biel and Majiok now have 70 more people ready for baptism,
       many of them former idol worshipers. Genuine friendship and
       Christian kindness won their hearts. Pray that the fighting in their
       area will cease so we can minister to these sincere people.

                 How to Study
                 a Bible Theme




 Sabbath Afternoon
 READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: John 1:14-16; Rom. 3:24;
 Gal. 3:18; Eph. 2:8-10.

     MEMORY TEXT: "They are now justified by his grace as a
     gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus" (Rom.
     3:24, NRSV).

     KEY THOUGHT: The thematic method of Bible study helps us
 to investigate the great themes of the Bible. We learn about the theme
 by approaching it with a set of questions, analyzing the passages,
 summarizing our conclusions, and then writing out a personal appli-
 cation. The purpose of this method of Bible study is to become
 acquainted with God's will as seen in major Bible passages.

     DISCOVERING GOD'S GRACE. To demonstrate the thematic
  approach to Bible study, this week we will study the theme "grace."
  The thematic approach is a type of topical study. Focusing on one
  theme, it explores the Bible's teaching and application of that theme
  to our lives. We discover what we can about a chosen theme by
  examining Bible passages that deal with it, allowing specific Bible
  passages to suggest questions for which we seek answers throughout
  Scripture. This method requires some tools for study (a concordance,
  Bible commentaries, and dictionaries), but we will provide all the
  information you need to understand the theme of grace in the Bible.
     One advantage of this method is that it is the easiest type of
  personal Bible study. It is a simple method that can result in a
. profound understanding of the Bible.

THEME: THE IMPORTANCE OF GRACE (John 1:14-16; Eph.
2:8-10).

  Steps in studying a Bible theme:
  1. Choose a theme to study that interests you.
  2. List all the biblical passages that you intend to study. Using
     your tools for Bible study, make a list of the verses that are
     related to the topical theme. You may wish to look up syno-
     nyms and other words and concepts that are related to your
     theme.
  3. Decide on the questions you want to ask. You may wish to use
     what, why, when, how, where, and who questions.
  4. Ask your questions of each passage that deals with the theme.
     Read the text first. Then ask your questions, and write down
     the answers you find on your question form.
  5. Draw a conclusion from your study. Ask, "What have I dis-
     covered about this theme?" Organize your answer into an
     outline.
  6. Ask and answer the question "So what?" Write out personal
     applications.

   Why is the topic of grace such an important topic for Chris-
tians to understand? Note how the following passages in context
address this question:

John 1:14-17
Rom. 3:24
Rom. 11:5, 6
1 Cor. 1:4-7
Eph. 2:8-10

   "We ourselves owe everything to God's free grace. Grace in the
covenant ordained our adoption. Grace in the Saviour effected our
redemption, our regeneration, and our exaltation to heirship with
Christ. Let this grace be revealed to others."—Christ's Object Les-
sons, p. 250.
   The importance of grace for Adventists is emphasized by Charles
Bradford, former North American Division president, who writes: "It
remains for those who drink deeply at grace's fountain to present
these living waters to all the people who dwell on earth. Seventh-day
Adventists must be in the vanguard, foremost exponents, stewards of
His matchless, saving grace. But this can only be as we become the
people in whom Yahweh's name dwells, fiercely loyal to Jesus
Christ."—Stuart Tyner, ed., Only by Grace (Riverside, Calif.: La
Sierra University Press, 1994), p. 24.

                                                                  47

ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS (Eph. 3:7, 8; Gal. 3:18).

   In the Greek New Testament, the word for "grace" (charis) is used
156 times. The Gospels of Luke and John use the word grace in the
sense of God's favor (Luke 1:30; 2:52), spiritual power (Luke 2:40;
John 1:14), and the gifts He bestows upon undeserving sinners (John
1:16, 17). Paul's Epistles use the word grace (charis) 99 times. We
will study grace only in Romans, Galatians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and
Ephesians. Below is a selection of texts we can use.

     Thematic Bible Study Sheet
     1. Theme: The apostle Paul's understanding of grace.
     2. List of Bible references:
        Rom. 1:5, 7            1 Cor. 1:3, 4         2 Cor. 13:14
        Rom. 3:24              1 Cor. 3:10           Gal. 1:3, 6, 15
        Rom. 4:16               1 Cor. 15:10         Gal. 2:9, 21
        Rom. 5:2               1 Cor. 16:23          Gal. 5:4
        Rom. 5:15, 17          2 Cor. 1:2, 12        Gal. 6:18
        Rom. 6:1, 14, 15       2 Cor. 4:15           Eph. 1:2, 6, 7
        Rom. 11:5, 6           2 Cor. 6:1            Eph. 2:5, 7, 8
        Rom. 12:3, 6           2 Cor. 8:1, 6, 7, 9   Eph. 3:2, 7, 8
        Rom. 15:15             2 Cor. 9:8, 14        Eph. 4:7
        Rom. 16:20             2 Cor. 12:9           Eph. 6:24

   The next step in thematic Bible study is to learn to ask the right
questions. This is a key activity in most personal Bible study. We are
admonished to study the Bible for ourselves. (See Christian Educa-
tion, p. 58.)

  Read Ephesians 3:7, 8 and Galatians 3:18, and write down two
additional questions implied in these texts.
  1. What are the benefits of grace that the text suggests?

     2.

     3

   Following are examples of questions on grace you may wish to
ask the texts. Or you may wish to use the questions you listed above.
   1. With what or with whom is grace associated?
   2. How are we involved in receiving and maintaining grace?
   3. What are the characteristics of grace?
   After establishing your questions, the next step in thematic Bible
study is to read through your references and ask your set of questions
of each verse, trying to be mindful of the context.

GETTING THE RIGHT ANSWERS (Rom. 11:5, 6).

    Use the form below to answer the questions about grace that you
asked. Ask your selected questions of each reference, and write the
answers in the appropriate space. You will need extra sheets of paper
to finish the study of grace in the Pauline letters because we have
listed only four biblical passages for today's study from the thirty
passages in our list in Monday's lesson. As you have time, you
should try to research all the texts listed. Answers to the questions for
the first passage are given here as an illustration of how you might
prepare your thematic study sheet.

   Questions we want to ask the text:
   A. With what or with whom is grace associated?
   B. How are we involved in receiving or maintaining grace?
   C. What are the characteristics of grace?
   Answers to questions:
   Scripture reference: Rom. 11:5, 6.
   A. Associated with the "remnant" chosen for salvation (verse 5).
   B. Grace given by God (verse 6).
   C. Grace comes by being chosen (verse 5). Grace is not earned
      by our works (verse 6).

   This section is the most critical of all your study. If you fail to
study thoroughly, you cannot draw accurate conclusions, and you
have the feeling that you will never know exactly what the Scriptures
say on a certain theme. You may be tempted to take only a brief time
to read the passage, trying to finish the assignment quickly. Take
your time! Study only a few texts at any one sitting, and pray about
their meaning before you try to answer any questions that you have
raised. During your study, you may find that your texts are answering
other questions. Take the time to jot down those answers, as well.


                                                                       49

DRAWING CONCLUSIONS (Rom. 5:17).

   The challenge in Bible study is to draw accurate conclusions. It is
easy to insert our own preconceived ideas into final evaluations. "In
your study of the word, lay at the door of investigation your precon-
ceived opinions and your hereditary and cultivated ideas. You will
never reach the truth if you study the Scriptures to vindicate your
own ideas. Leave these at the door, and with a contrite heart go in to
hear what the Lord has to say to you."—Ellen G. White, The Youth's
Instructor, July 24, 1902.

   After you have read through all the references and tried to
answer the questions you have asked of the Bible passages, orga-
nize and summarize the responses to each question. You might
try to build an outline or a summary paragraph, or you may
want to group the answers that seem to be alike into one section
of your outline.

   In developing your outline summary or in drawing conclusions,
you might begin like this: (Insights regarding grace from other texts
in the list in Monday's lesson have been added to illustrate the depth
of information the Bible provides.)
   Summary questions:
   A. With what or with whom is grace associated?
      With God, Jesus, and salvation.
      Set in contrast to righteousness by works.
      A gift that includes the gift of God's righteousness (Rom.
      5:17).
      Redemption (Rom. 3:24).
      Comes through faith (Eph. 2:8).
      Peace (Eph.1:2).
   B. How are we involved in getting and maintaining grace?
      From our "birth" and "rebirth" (Gal. 1:15).
      Comes by being chosen.
      Comes by the power of God.
   C. What are the characteristics of grace?
      Free to believers.
      Comes from Jesus because of His death.
      Empowers servants of Jesus.
      Keeps us true to Christ's true gospel (Gal. 1:6).
      Makes us alive in Christ and dead to sin (Eph. 2:5).

   We have listed only some of the passages from which we have
drawn conclusions about grace. See whether you can discover some
other texts that are the basis for the preceding conclusions.

APPLYING THE BIBLE TO OUR LIVES (1 Cor. 2:14-3:4).

   The Bible talks to us about various kinds of Christians. (See
1 Corinthians 2 and 3.) These types of people include those who are
without the Spirit (1 Cor. 2:14), those who are called spiritual (1 Cor.
2:15), and those who are worldly, "mere infants in Christ" (1 Cor.
3:1, NIV). Could it be that each of us might fall into one of these
categories? The text provides a clear understanding of each type of
person. Notice that those without the Spirit of God fail to accept the
things that come from the Spirit. And infants in Christ need a type of
food different from that needed by those considered spiritual. This
means that people internalize the Word of God differently. That is
why application is so personal.
   In order to implement what we have learned and to make it
important to our lives, we need to write out a personal application
that is practical and workable. In this last section, we will look at the
general theme and decide what we are going to do about the Bible
message. You may wish to look at each text, and ask it a personal
question. But for our purposes in this day's study, we will ask only
the general application questions:
   1. What does all this mean for me?
   2. In what way will my actions, attitudes, or decisions change,
       now that I know more about the grace of God?


   After studying the passages on grace provided with this week's
study, we might draw the following conclusion: (Use this as an
example of how to write an application response.)

   Application:
   Based on my study of grace in the Pauline letters, I will . . .
    a. Learn to accept grace as a gift on a daily basis.
     b. Be open to the workings of grace and salvation in my life
        today.
     c. Recognize that obedience to God's law is a response to
        grace, not a means of earning salvation.

  Use the space below to conclude your own study of grace in the
Pauline letters.

   Application:
   Based on my study of grace in the Pauline letters, I will . . .




                                                                       51
Friday                                               February 9
FURTHER STUDY: Read Evangelism, p. 190; Gospel Workers,
p. 315.
   As you have studied, you have probably seen that the apostle Paul
sees grace as a significant gift from God. In fact, it is the essence of
God's decisive saving act in Jesus Christ, which took place on the
cross. The consequences of this saving grace through Jesus dramati-
cally influence our lives in the here and now and in the future. The
term grace arises out of God's basic act of pardon for sinners. Paul
recognizes the whole Christian life as empowered by grace—guaran-
teed by it, anchored by it, and governed by it—because of God's
wonderful gift of love for us in Jesus' death on the cross.
   "The sacrifice of Christ as an atonement for sin is the great truth
around which all other truths cluster. In order to be rightly under-
stood and appreciated, every truth in the Word of God, from Genesis
to Revelation, must be studied in the light which streams from the
cross of Calvary, and in connection with the wondrous, central truth
of the Saviour's atonement. Those who study the Redeemer's won-
derful sacrifice grow in grace and knowledge."—Ellen G. White
Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1137.

  You may wish to study such Bible themes as: (1) how to know
God's will; (2) praising the Lord in the Psalms; (3) learning to
pray—great prayers in the Bible.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS ABOUT GRACE AND THEMATIC
 BIBLE STUDY:
  1. What other themes in Scripture would you like to under-
     stand?

     2. What is the value of thematic Bible study? How can the-
        matic Bible study be used in evangelism and personal wit-
        nessing? What creative uses can you find for this kind of
        study?

     3. How can one be saved by grace through faith and still be
        concerned about sinless living?

SUMMARY: Thematic Bible study is one helpful means of learning
more about grace. Grace, the love of God manifested in His infinite
saving work for humanity, has been available throughout history.
The cross was the supreme revelation of God's grace. His grace
continually comes to us through the compassionate ministry of the
Holy Spirit in our hearts.

              Faith Stronger Than Witchcraft
                    J. H. Joseph and Madan La11

     A layman who lives in North India found Christ and was eager
 to share God's love with others. As soon as he was baptized he
 began to give Bible studies to his family. One by one they ac-
 cepted God's love and became his first jewels for Jesus. Even
 some of the man's cousins were baptized. In all, the man brought
30 souls to Jesus.
     One of the man's neighbors, Satpal, was not a Christian. In
 fact, the man's father, Sohan, practiced witchcraft. He "helped"
 the people of the village who had any kind of trouble. Sohan
 organized large melas where people gathered to take part in the
 rituals of devil worship. People came long distances hoping to be
 healed. Others wanted to apease an angry god or have a curse
 removed.
     One day old Sohan died. Family members buried him in their
 own yard and built an altar over the grave on which to conduct
 worship daily.
     About this time the Christian layman met Satpal, old Sohan's
 son, and told him about the amazing love of Jesus. Satpal listened
 carefully, and eventually accepted Jesus as his personal Savior.
     Satpal's family members began harassing him; some stopped
 speaking to him. They threatened to cut him off from the family
  inheritance. But Satpal had found a faith stronger than his father's
  witchcraft; he did not yield to Satan. Satpal married and moved
  into a small one-room home. They were crowded, but he was
  happy in the Lord.
     Satpal's mother and brother continued to worship daily at the
  altar over his father's tomb. One night Satpal dreamed that God
  commanded him to demolish the altar on his father's grave. The
  altar was a reminder of Satan's work and power, so Satpal de-
  stroyed it. Many thought that Satpal and his family would be
  harmed or killed, but to everyone's amazement, the family did not
  seek revenge. In fact, Satpal's mother began to open to the love of
  God. Although she does not attend church, she sometimes opens
  her home to Christian meetings. Pray that Satpal's witness will
  one day unite his family at the altar of Christ.

    J. H. Joseph is a pastor, and Madan Lall is a layman in
  Northern India.

    At a time when technology has brought the world's popu-
lations together in a "global community," the forces of sepa-
ratism, tribal warfare, ethnic rivalry, and racism seem to be
                                out of control. Sadly, the church
                                of Christ—and that includes the
                                Seventh-day Adventist Church—
                                has not been immune to these
                                gospel-denying forces. Can we
                                get back to the cross, where all
                                men and women are made "one
                                in Christ Jesus" (Galatians 3:28)?
                                   The answer is Yes. The time is
                                now.

                                church, addresses the global
                                mission of Seventh-day

                                members to remove racial bar-
                                 riers and build bridges of under-
standing as the cross of Christ demands.

 Christians to love each other and reflect the image of God in
 the last days.

                  How to Study
                   Inductively




Sabbath Afternoon ---
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Eph. 2:1-22.

     MEMORY TEXT: "But because of his great love for us, God,
     who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we
     were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been
     saved" (Eph. 2:4, 5, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Inductive Bible study seeks to determine the
exact meaning of a passage on the basis of language and context. By
exploring a specific chapter or section of Scripture, we can learn
inductively more of God's will for our lives and the manner in which
He wishes to transform us. We learn about God's grace, the means of
reconciliation with Him.

   GRACE AND RECONCILIATION. The Bible explains how
God saves us. Through Bible study we discover the "how" of salvation,
as well as its personal results, the "so what." Inductive Bible study is
the process of letting the text speak to us, rather than bringing our own
agenda to the text. The primary purpose of this type of study is to find
out what the Bible says, and its secondary purpose is to determine what
the message means to us. We carefully observe the text, its content, and
context. We look at each paragraph, sentence, and word in an in-
tensely detailed and systematic manner. There are at least six steps in
this method: (1) Discover what the chapter is about; write a chapter title
and summary. (2) Make a list of everything you observe in the passage.
(3) Ask questions about the passage. (4) Relate your chapter to other
similar passages. (5) List some possible applications. (6) Write down
concluding thoughts and observations.

Sunday                                             February 11
FINDING OUT THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE TEXT (Eph.
2:1-22).

   Read Ephesians 2:1-22 in its entirety two or three times, and
reflect on its purpose, style, content, and message. What do you
think is the main theme of the chapter? Prepare for your study
by having a concordance, paper, and pen available.
   The first step in the inductive approach is to understand the big
picture. An artist, looking at a scene he or she wishes to paint, spends
time looking for patterns, colors, shapes, movement, and a point of
focus. Similarly, the Bible student carefully surveys the passage
under study:
   1. Write the message of the chapter in your own words. Ex-
      press it in such a way so that, when you read your version to
      others, they receive the gist of the passage.
   2. You may want to outline the chapter in detail. Look at all
      the paragraph divisions in Ephesians 2. Assign a title to each
      paragraph, and then place some subpoints under each one. For
      example:
      I. "We come alive through grace."
          A. We were trapped in sin.
          B. We are alive because of God's love.
          C. Our salvation proves how rich God's love is.
          D. We represent to the universe what Christ is like.
   3. Use your creativity to rewrite the passage, using only the
      subjects, verbs, and objects. For example, you might rewrite
      the first paragraph in Ephesians 2 this way: "We were dead
      when we followed worldly ways. We gratified sinful nature.
      By grace we are saved through faith. In the coming age, the
      richness of God's kindness is revealed." This approach high-
      lights the major thrust of the content.

   Read the following story, and reflect on how Ephesians 2 provides
the answer to the problem:
   A 16-year-old young woman named Leslie made three life-
changing decisions. She began sleeping with her boyfriend, she took up
smoking marijuana, and she stopped going to church. Her parents seemed
totally unaware of what was happening to their precious daughter.
    Her youth pastor was devastated. He could not understand why
Leslie was doing things that would hurt her and rejecting things that
could give her strength.
    Leslie's problems are not exclusive to teenagers. We need to ask
ourselves,. if we knew exactly what was required to live a healthier,
happier, and more prosperous life, would we do it? (Adapted from
Mark Gilroy, Group Magazine, September 1992, p. 58.)

                                                                      57

MAKING SENSE OUT OF YOUR OBSERVATIONS (Eph. 2:1-
22; Mark 4:35-41).

    The next part of the inductive method is careful observation. For
example, if you study the story of Jesus and the storm on the Sea of
Galilee in Mark 4:35-41, what do you notice first? You see Jesus, the
terrified disciples, the lake, the storm, and a sinking boat. But if you
observe more closely, you notice that some of these men were pro-
fessional fishermen. The storm was testing them at the point of their
greatest ability, but still they were afraid. The parallels in our own
lives are clear. We are often tested at the point of our greatest
strength. Our strengths often prove to be our chief areas of vulner-
ability.
    Careful observation is crucial if we are to understand the Bible. "It
is the first and highest duty of every rational being to learn from the
Scriptures what is truth, and then to walk in the light and encourage
others to follow his example. We should day by day study the Bible
diligently, weighing every thought and comparing scripture with
scripture. With divine help we are to form our opinions for ourselves
as we are to answer for ourselves before God."—The Great Contro-
versy, p. 598.

  Make a list of everything you observe in Ephesians 2. The
purpose is to become completely saturated with the content of the
passage, something that a cursory reading of the text will not do.
We want to answer the question What does the text say?


   Here is a list of observations on Ephesians 2:1-6. Compare this list
with yours, and complete the assignment by looking at each text in
chapter 2:
   1. Eph. 2:1. I was dead in sin; now I am alive because of Jesus.
   2. Eph. 2:2. The evil one works in people who are disobedient.
  3. Eph. 2:3. When we serve ourselves, we are just like those
      disobedient ones.
  4. Eph. 2:4. God has great mercy for us.
   5. Eph. 2:5. God's grace brings us alive spiritually.
   6. Eph. 2:5, 6. By grace we sit with Jesus in heaven.

    List key words in the chapter. Look for repeated words and
 phrases. Look for questions being asked that need answers.
 Look for commands, warnings, comparisons, and contrasts.
 Identify the illustrations. Look for lists of things and explana-
 tions. Notice the people, places, and situations involved.

HOW TO GLEAN INFORMATION AS YOU INTERPRET THE
PASSAGE (Eph. 2:1-22; Luke 15:11-31).

   Now that you have made detailed observations of your passage in
Ephesians 2 about grace and reconciliation, it is time to begin to ask
other questions of the text. Some call these "interpretative ques-
tions," because they focus on the meaning of the passage. The
answers provide the key to understanding the passage. Usually, inter-
pretative questions begin with words like what or why. For example,
we might ask, Why did Paul write this about grace? What is the
context out of which he wrote? What are the implications for our
lives in the sentence: "For it is by grace you have been saved,
through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of
God—not by works, so that no one can boast" (verse 8, NIV).

  Write down your questions and answers. That will help later,
when you try to draw conclusions about the passage.

   Do not forget to investigate difficult passages, things that you
simply do not understand. Note these in the section below:

Questions:




Difficulties in the passage:




    In order to understand the difficulties you have encoun-
 tered, you may wish to consult a dictionary, a concordance, the
 writings of Ellen G. White, or a Bible commentary. Now is a
 good time to compare other translations of the Bible with the
 one you are studying. See whether another version helps you in
 your understanding of the passage. You may also wish to look
 at related Bible passages. (See Luke 15:11-32; Prov. 3:34.)

                                                                    59

MAKING SENSE OF A CHAPTER (Eph. 2:1-22).

   Remember, our goal in Bible study is not only information and
direction; it is also application that motivates us to be recognizable
children of God.
   Study the significance of Ephesians 2:8, 9. Here we see a connec-
tion of a unique kind. It is almost a contrast of opposites. Paul says
that you have been saved "by grace . . . through faith . . . the gift of
God." This is in opposition to "not from yourselves . . . not by works,
so that no one can boast" (verses 8, 9, NIV).
   In verses 11-22, Paul adds a comforting picture of how Christ
brings peace. Christ tears down the walls of hostility that separate
people, and He restores a unity of love, friendliness, and hospitality
among all races and classes. Grace is the basis of all peacemaking.

   How could a knowledge of grace and salvation in Christ re-
lieve tensions in the world today in those areas where conflict
prevails? What walls of hostility are there in the church that
need to be torn down? According to Ephesians 2, how does
peacemaking occur?


   You may wish to begin an outline of the insights you have gleaned
from your study of Ephesians 2. For example, you might list the
following as possible insights: (1) Salvation by grace through faith
tears down barriers between groups. races, families, and individuals.
(2) Grace is the means by which we receive salvation. We cannot
work for salvation; we cannot do anything to deserve it. God gives it
as a gift. (3) Through Jesus' death we now have direct access to God.
(4) Grace from Jesus is the most empowering gift for our victorious
Christian walk.
   "No distinction on account of nationality, race, or caste, is recog-
nized by God. He is the Maker of all mankind. All men are of one
family by creation, and all are one through redemption. Christ came
to demolish every wall of partition, to throw open every compart-
ment of the temple, that every soul may have free access to God. His
love is so broad, so deep, so full, that it penetrates everywhere. It lifts
out of Satan's circle the poor souls who have been deluded by his
deceptions. It places them within reach of the throne of God, the
throne encircled by the rainbow of promise."—Christ's Object
Lessons, p. 386.

 in the Christian life?

APPLYING THE PASSAGE TO OUR LIVES (Eph. 2:1-22).

   We have asked what the text says and what the text means. We
have learned inductively what the Lord wants us to learn about grace
and hostility. Now we need to bring our study of the passage to a
conclusion.
   Review the main points we have learned about Ephesians 2, and
consider the implications of this textual study. Ask, "What am I
going to do about this now?"

   What is the relationship between works and Christ's gift of
salvation through grace? Eph. 2:8-10 (compare Rom. 2:13; 3:31;
Rev. 22:12).


   Certainly, works are important in Christian living, and God expects
obedience of His children. But Ephesians 2:8, 9 clearly says that
grace is the means of salvation, and we receive it through our faith
(commitment to what Jesus does for and in us), not by any activity of
our own. One conclusion we might draw is that we should endeavor,
through the power of Christ's grace, to reflect in our behavior the
wonderful message and gift given us through Christ's death on the
cross. (See Rom. 8:3, 4.) Our behavior may change in relation to our
experience of grace, rather than by our efforts to earn salvation.

   List three practical applications to your life of Ephesians 2:1-
22. Notice especially the implied action found in verses 19 and 20.


   Our study sheet for the inductive approach to Bible study has the
following divisions, plus enough room to answer the questions thor-
oughly:

we think the text says.

FURTHER STUDY: Select another chapter in your Bible, and be-
gin an inductive study. Try Ephesians 1, which is about finding
God's purpose in our lives; or Psalm 86, which deals with openness
to God's leading. These are excellent chapters with which to begin
using the inductive method of Bible study. The key to inductive
Bible study is to explore the text by using questions that arise out of
our understanding of the text itself. Look at style, people, places,
themes, theology, actions, interactions, counsel, commands, and any-
thing else the text provides. Go to the text with significant questions,
and watch the text come alive with meaning and personal applica-
tion.

    In studying the parables of Jesus, if possible, use a version of
the New Testament that has the Gospel accounts in parallel
columns. Compare the stories in each Gospel account, and see
how each writer emphasizes a different purpose for the story or
provides different information. Notice how this enhances your
understanding of the passages. See Mark 12:1-12, the parable of
the tenants. Compare the parallel passages, Matthew 21:33-46
and Luke 20:9-19. Explore the meaning of this parable for your
life, using the inductive method.

   For further study about grace, see Christ's Object Lessons, "Like
Unto Leaven," pp. 95-102. Learn from this chapter about the power
of sin in our lives and about God's love for us. Read The Great
Controversy, "God's People Delivered," pp. 635-652. Note the place
of faith and grace in the lives of God's end-time people.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How do you determine what questions to ask of a Bible
     passage so as to determine its meaning? How do you de-
     cide whether or not your questions are valid?

     2. What physical and spiritual preparations are needed for
        deep, thoughtful Bible study?

     3. What have you learned from this study of Ephesians 2?
        What difference will it make in your life?

SUMMARY: Using the inductive method (detailed study of content
and context), we can determine the meaning of Ephesians 2:1-22.
Christians who understand the depth of love revealed in Jesus' death
on our behalf are aware of the true motivation for abiding in
Christ—His infinite sacrifice for us. God's love in His gift of grace
enables us to live, learn, and serve according to His will.

                        Charlotte Ishkanian

   How do 14 people make an impact for God in a city in the
former Soviet Union? Everyone has a part to play.
   Nearly 100 children crowd into a plain hall in downtown Rezina,
Moldova, a city of 30,000. As the children enter, they give the
greeter their answer sheets for yesterday's Bible study quiz, then
take their seats. They wear their coats in the unheated room.
   A woman tells a Bible story, using felts donated by a church
overseas, to hold the children's attention.The children take turns
placing felts on the board as she tells the story. They wiggle in
anticipation of a turn holding the felts or answering a question.
   Only four of the children here are Adventists. The others come
from Orthodox homes or homes where religion is not a part of their
lives. So the familiar Bible stories are new to these children.
   Two young Adventist girls, 10-year-olds Lilia Maftei [MAWF-
tay] and Alona Yakovienko, sing a simple, unaccompanied duet
for the children, then help teach them a song that the children will
sing for their parents on Sunday night.
    After the meeting the children receive their next Bible study
quiz. I ask how so many children learned about the meetings. Lilia
Maftei, the pastor's daughter, smiles and says the whole church—
all 14 members—gave out invitations. "I went with two women,"
Lilia explained. "I did not know what to say, but the women said
they would do the talking. At the door, they forgot what to say, so I
invited the people to our meetings. The people came! Now I am
 not afraid to invite people to hear about God."
    Lilia has helped her father in his ministry for most of her life.
She and Alona will sing for the adults' meeting tonight. The girls
are eager to help win others to God.
    In a country that has few Adventists, everyone shares in the
                          work. Pastor Maftei has two churches and
                          14 small groups meeting in homes through-
                          out the area. He tries to visit each church
                          once every month. Even then, he often gets
                          home only one night a week. In a minister's
                          family in the Euro-Asia Division, every-
                          one has a part in the church's ministry,
                          even the children.

         The Text Speaks
      About Worship (Part 1)




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Exod. 4:29-31; 5; Isaiah 6;
John 4:1-38.

     MEMORY TEXT: " 'My food,' said Jesus, 'is to do the will of
     him who sent me and to finish his work' " (John 4:34, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Worship is a heart response to God's pres-
ence. Worship expresses our adoration, reverence, praise for God,
and commitment to Him. Like faith, it is a product of grace. Worship
extends beyond the formal service of the church each weekend. It
defines how we are to live in a world entrapped by evil and shaped by
a secular culture that has as its goal selfish exploitation and self-
aggrandizement. Worship enriches our personal spiritual lives and
provides motivation for corporate action.

   WORSHIP AND PRAISE. We will use the inductive method to
explore this theological and practical topic. We will review the method
and seek insight into the meaning and purpose of worship.
   Throughout the Bible the restoration of worship is presented as
the first step in returning to God. While the Israelites were still in
Egypt, God restored their sense of national identity through the
reestablishment of worship practices. In a meeting between Moses,
Aaron, and the elders of Israel, Moses outlined the process whereby
God would help His people leave Egypt. In that first meeting, wor-
ship was reinstituted. (See Exod. 4:29-31.)

THE PURPOSE OF WORSHIP (Isaiah 6).

   As you read and reread the sixth chapter of Isaiah, focus on
the purpose of the chapter. What is the writer saying? Who are
the characters involved?


   Notice this comment on Isaiah 6 from a Bible dictionary: "That
God was the Holy One was inscribed indelibly on Isaiah's heart as a
result of his inaugural vision (vi. 3). As Amos has been called the
prophet of righteousness and Hosea the prophet of lovingkindness,
so Isaiah has been called the prophet of holiness. . . . God is the Holy
One; that means He is so highly exalted above His creatures as to be
totally different from them, not only in His moral perfection (cf. vi.
5) but also in His power, His wrath, His love, His faithfulness, and all
His virtues (cf. also xxix. 16, xxxi. 3). Yahweh's holiness is the very
essence of His divine being, which causes men to tremble before
Him as they worship Him."—J. D. Douglas, ed., The New Bible
Dictionary (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1965), p. 574.
   Ellen White suggests, "The long reign of Uzziah [also known as
Azariah] in the land of Judah and Benjamin was characterized by a
prosperity greater than that of any other ruler since the death of
Solomon, nearly two centuries before. . . . This outward prosperity,
however, was not accompanied by a corresponding revival of spir-
itual power."—Prophets and Kings, p. 303.
   Too often, we look for some "experience" of worship that will
grip us in such a way that we will follow God because we can do no
other. We leave the presence of God, wondering why our expecta-
tions have not been fulfilled. We believe incorrectly that there is a
specific type of worship format, type, or style that God expects.

   Write a paraphrase of Isaiah 6:1-13, or outline it in detail as
you explore Isaiah's experience with God. What is the context of
Isaiah's experience of worship? Why did he have his unique
worship experience? What was Isaiah's response to the vision of
God that he received?

OBSERVING THE TEXT (Isa. 6:1-13).

   Today we want to examine in detail what the chapter says. To do
this we must ask clear questions that arise from our reading of the
passage under study. Here are some observations to make of the
passage regarding the vision. You may wish to write them in the
observation section of your own study guide, using the form in last
week's lesson.

  Observation: (What does the chapter say?)
  1. What was the attitude of the prophet to the vision of God?
     (verse 5).
  2. What does God's throne room look like? (verses 1, 4).
  3. How are the angels described? (verses 2, 6).
  4. What was the angel's message to Isaiah? (verses 3, 7).
  5. How did Isaiah respond? (verse 8).
  6. What was the essence of God's message for Isaiah? (verses 7,
     8, 10).
  7. What was the message Isaiah was to share with God's people?
     (verses 9, 10).
  8. What were God's stipulations for Isaiah about the message of
     warning? (verses 11-13).

  What other questions arise from this passage? Look up King
Uzziah and the prophet Isaiah in a Bible dictionary, and read
about the cultural setting. See Ellen G. White, Prophets and
Kings, "The Call of Isaiah," pp. 303-310.


   "This assurance of the final fulfillment of God's purpose brought
courage to the heart of Isaiah. What though earthly powers array
themselves against Judah? What though the Lord's messenger meet
with opposition and resistance? Isaiah had seen the King, the Lord of
hosts; he had heard the song of the seraphim, 'The whole earth is full
of His glory;' he had the promise that the messages of Jehovah to
backsliding Judah would be accompanied by the convicting power of
the Holy Spirit; and the prophet was nerved for the work before
him. . . . Throughout his long and arduous mission he carried with
him the memory of this vision. For sixty years or more he stood
before the children of Judah as a prophet of hope, waxing bolder and
still bolder in his predictions of the future triumph of the church."
—Prophets and Kings, p. 310.

   What are the results of meeting God in worship? What
 happens to our lives when we are confronted by the living God?

INFORMATION ABOUT WORSHIP (Isaiah 6).

  Notice the following about Isaiah 6 and the prophet's worship
experience. Fill in your own study sheet, based on the inductive
method of Bible study.

  Interpretation: (What does the chapter mean?)

  1. It was an encounter with the Holy God (verse 1). In personal
     and corporate worship, do we sense the presence of God? We
     may expect a God of our own making to grace our worship.
     Too often we expect a feeling to be present, some emotional
     or sensory experience to validate our need for God or to prove
     that we have been saved. "Do not wait to feel that you are
     made whole, but say, 'I believe it; it is so, not because I feel it,
     but because God has promised.' "—Steps to Christ, p. 51.
         Needing some emotional experience to validate God's ac-
     tions in Jesus is a subtle form of works-righteousness. Our
     need to prove that God is at work puts us in control of the
     experience, rather than allowing God to be the only source of
     the blessing.
  2. Isaiah's worship experience was designed to meet his needs
     and to direct him to greater challenges (verses 1, 7, 8). In this
     worship experience, Isaiah was called and inducted into the
     prophetic office. Worship at its best is a chance to meet God
     and to find direction for our lives. Most of the worship experi-
     ences recorded in sacred Scripture move the person beyond
     his or her petty concerns into the realm of God's concerns for
     the world. For example, as Daniel prayed for his people, he
      was moved to focus not only on the destroyed temple complex
      in Jerusalem but on the danger that the "chosen" people of
     God might reject the Messiah Himself. Worship stretches us
      beyond our present concerns to eternal priorities.

  What were the priorities God had in mind for Isaiah? How
can those priorities be translated into our day and time?


   3. Worship for Isaiah included a command to act. We sometimes
      forget that worship is not a passive activity. We are not only to
      watch and wait, but we are to be inspired to act in God's
      behalf. Passive worship may be too introspective to be helpful.

   Are your responses to God as positive and spontaneous as
 were Isaiah's? Can you describe your past responses?

                                                                        67

APPLICATIONS OF WORSHIP (Isaiah 6; John 4:1-38).

    John 4:1-38 provides a look at worship from Jesus' perspective as
He sat at the foot of Mount Gerizim speaking with a Samaritan
woman. As Isaiah does, Jesus gives a model for worship that moves
to direct action and thereby explains the nature of true spiritual
worship.
    At Sychar Jesus visited Jacob's well. From that spot you can view
the famous Old Testament mountains of blessing and cursing. On
Mount Gerizim the Samaritans had erected an alternative worship
site from that of the temple in Jerusalem. After giving "living" water
to the woman, a discussion ensued about the proper "place" for
worship. Jesus suggested that the place is not as crucial as the spir-
itual nature of worship itself. He wants us all to have God's living
water, the proper refreshment for our lives. "Worship in spirit and in
truth" (John 4:24, NIV) is crucial, Jesus declares. This raises the
question of Spirit-filled worship and truth-filled worship practice.

   What does it mean to worship in Spirit and in truth? Did
Isaiah worship in this way? What is spiritual worship? What is
truth-filled worship? Explain what Jesus meant by spiritual wor-
ship.


   Our passages in Isaiah and John provide ample opportunity to
draw applications that can influence our lives. Study Isaiah 6:8-13;
then draw some applications for your life from each verse. Below we
have tried to identify some obvious applications of Isaiah 6:1-8.

and from Jesus' discussion in John 4. What elements of worship
do these texts illustrate? How can our worship in public and
private be enriched as a result of our study of these passages?

CONCLUSIONS ABOUT WORSHIP (2 Sam. 6:5, 14; Isaiah 6;
Matt. 6:5-18).

    Worship has two aspects: private and public. As we read in the
Bible about private worship, we are directed to Jesus' counsel on
prayer in the Sermon on the Mount (Matt. 6:5-18). Here Jesus indi-
cates that private worship is very personal. It is not to bolster private
egos or to separate people who are more spiritual from those who are
less spiritual. Prayer is to be uniquely individualistic.
   The Old Testament pictures public worship using many Middle
Eastern forms. We see David singing before the Lord when He
delivered him from the hand of all his enemies. He sang, "The Lord
is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer; my God is my rock, in
whom I take refuge, my shield and the horn of my salvation" (2 Sam.
22:2, 3, NIV). Again, we see David bringing the ark back to Jerusa-
lem with great celebration, involving singing, instruments, and danc-
ing. "David and the whole house of Israel were celebrating with all
their might before the Lord. . . . David, wearing a linen ephod,
danced before the Lord with all his might" (2 Samuel 6:5, 14, NIV).
From this example, we learn that worship forms are sometimes
influenced by circumstances, cultures, and needs.

  How do these biblical examples of worship enhance our own
worship practices? What conclusions can you draw from Isaiah
about the type of worship that is Spirit-filled and truth-directed?
What makes us comfortable in our worship style and method?
What are some of the cultural and generational differences in
worship practices that fall within the Spirit and truth model?


   The words used in the Bible in connection with worship point to
the qualities of worship that God desires for His people. For ex-
ample, the words to serve and deacon imply either voluntary or
compulsory work done for another person. In other places in the
Bible, worship is an "inner attitude." We should come from any
worship experience inspired to serve others.
   Use the last section of the inductive-study sheet to write conclu-
sions to your study of Isaiah 6:

   Conclusion: (What did I learn?)


   Be as practical as possible, and identify one thing that you
 want to see happen in your own public and/or private worship
 experience.

FURTHER STUDY: Read Steps to Christ, "Faith and Acceptance,"
pp. 49-55; Prophets and Kings, " 'Behold Your God,' " pp. 311-321;
The Desire of Ages, "At Jacob's Well," pp. 188-190. Study also the
following Bible references about worship: Psalm 89 about praise;
Psalm 66 about joy; Psalm 102 about prayer.

   When Jesus was visiting with the woman at the well outside
Sychar, He endeavored to have her focus on true worship of God, not
on controversial issues. "He desired to lift the thoughts of His hearer
above matters of form and ceremony, and questions of controversy.
`The hour cometh,' He said, 'and now is, when the true worshipers
shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh
such to worship Him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship Him must
worship Him in spirit and in truth.' "—The Desire of Ages, p. 189.

   How does this story help us to understand aspects of our
worship service and how to identify those elements that benefit
individuals in our congregations?

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Is religion confined to external forms and ceremonies?
     Explain.

     2. If you could plan the "ideal" worship service for your
        church, what would you include? Why?

     3. How would you change your private worship practices, in
        light of what you have studied in Isaiah and John?

     4. What do you think of this quotation? "Wherever a soul
        reaches out after God, there the Spirit's working is mani-
        fest, and God will reveal Himself to that soul. For such
        worshipers He is seeking. He waits to receive them, and to
        make them His sons and daughters."—The Desire of Ages,
        p. 189.

SUMMARY: Through the inductive method of Bible study, we
learned this week that Isaiah's experience (Isaiah 6) provides a won-
derful example of the worship experiences that God's people might
have. The condition is that they come to Him with open hearts and a
willingness to listen to His voice. By beholding the glory of the Holy
One, Isaiah found purpose for his life and motivation to respond to
God's call. True worship provides the basis of understanding our
relationship with God and our mission in the world.

                                  Sandy Birdsong

           I never knew about Jesus until in my late teens. In my young
        adult life I attended a church and sang in their choir, but I never
        understood phrases like "Washed in the blood." I did not know
        what it meant to be a Christian. For all these years I was nothing
        more than a secular humanist. But during the last few months a
        whole new joyous life has opened to me.
           My dear friend Brenda suffered from a terminal illness, and I
        spent a lot of time with her. For almost four months a group of
        kind people who didn't even know Brenda brought meals to her
        home every day. I noticed something different about these people.
        They lived like real Christians. Brenda's husband, Nick, services
        computers, and one of his clients is the General Conference of-
        fices. As Nick became acquainted with some workers at the church's
        headquarters, he told them about Brenda's illness, and those people
        began praying with him. Some of them began bringing food by for
        the family. Nick started studying the Bible with them, searching
        for answers to his deepest questions.
            After Brenda's death I continued to visit Nick and his daughter
        Doreen to help them through their grief. Sometimes we had strong
        discussions about religion. One day Nick challenged me, "Have
        you ever read the Bible?" I accepted Nick's challenge and started
        reading the Bible. Then Nick loaned me a book on Daniel. The
        Bible became real to me. I read the Christian literature hungrily.
            Nick invited me to one of the Bible studies at his house. I went,
        but I resisted some ideas and had lots of questions about what we
        were studying. Through it all Dr. Erwin Gane, the teacher, was so
        patient and accepting. I kept coming. For most of my life I seemed
        to be looking into a mirror of self reliance; now I seemed to be
        climbing a ladder, reaching out to Jesus.
            Finally I surrendered my life to Jesus and was baptized. It was
        the most joyful day of my life. I have met wonderful new friends
        in Christ. Now I want to share Jesus with my two sons and my
        friends.
            I thank God that He reached out to me, and I pray that every
        Christian will find ways to reach out to others. It changed my life
         and it will change many others.

READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Acts 2:1-21; 9:1-18;
Titus 2.

     MEMORY TEXT: "He it is who gave himself for us that he
     might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a
     people of his own who are zealous for good deeds. Declare
     these things" (Titus 2:14, 15, NRSV).

   KEY THOUGHT: The New Testament describes corporate and
personal worship experiences that are rich in meaning. This week we
will study inductively three worship passages recorded in the New
Testament.

PENTECOST AND THE HOLY SPIRIT (Acts 2:1-21).

   The next step in our inductive-study plan is to summarize the
content of the Scripture passage. Either write a paraphrase or outline
the passage in detail. You may wish to use the space below as you
summarize the story of the unique worship experience on the Day of
Pentecost.

   Chapter Summary:




   Below is a list of questions about the Pentecost experience in the
early church (Acts 2).

   Observation: (What does the text say?)
   1. What purpose brought the believers together in the room?
   2. Name three audiovisual signs of the Spirit's coming.
   3. What caused the crowd to gather?
   4. How did the people respond to the signs they witnessed?
   5. What does the passage tell us about how God worked in that
      worship situation?
   6. How many language groups heard the gospel?
   7. What was the result of this worship experience?

  What other questions would you like to ask of Acts 2? Can you
draw any conclusions from this passage about how the Holy
Spirit works in congregational life? Should the Pentecost experi-
ence become a norm for our church worship?


   Pentecost, the Feast of Weeks (Exod. 34:22), of First Fruits (Num.
28:26), or of Harvest (Exod. 23:16), was established fifteen centuries
before Christ and became one of the three pilgrim festivals of the
Jews (Exod. 23:14-17). The New Testament name was derived from
the fact that it was celebrated on the fiftieth day after the Passover.
   "The disciples prayed with intense earnestness for a fitness to
meet men and in their daily intercourse to speak words that would
lead sinners to Christ. Putting away all differences, all desire for the
supremacy, they came close together in Christian fellowship. They
drew nearer and nearer to God, and as they did this they realized what
a privilege had been theirs in being permitted to associate so closely
with Christ."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 37.

                                                                     73

THE CONVERSION OF PAUL AND PERSONAL WORSHIP
(Acts 9:1-18; 22:1-16; 26:4-19).

   Compare and contrast the three accounts of Paul's conver-
sion. Review the personal struggles involved in his initial worship
experiences as a Christian.


    Personal religious experience is a type of worship. Throughout the
Bible are descriptions of people whose devotion to God was manifest
in their encounters with Him. The Greek verb translated "to convert"
(epistrepho) means "to turn," "to turn around," "to turn back." Other
terms in the New Testament reinforce the concept of return and
regeneration for responding sinners. These terms include such phrases
as born again, born from above, newness of life, made alive in
Christ, a new creation. The New Testament records instances of
change from one way of life to another.
   The apostles were called to follow Jesus. Those who accepted
Jesus, either before or after His death, were healed in spirit and were
called to follow a new way of life. In these Bible stories, worship
produced a change of heart and life. Paul's conversion was a highly
personal worship experience involving a crisis of faith.

     Ask the following questions of Acts 9:1-18:

     Observation: (What does the text say?)
     1. After reading this passage, describe Paul's character.

     2. What did Paul call the early Christians?

     3. What signs accompanied his worship experience?

     4. What was the reason for Christ's appearance?

     5. What was the result of the roadside encounter?

     6. What role did others perform in Paul's character change?

     7. What was the result of Paul's encounter with God?

   There are other questions that you can ask of the passage.
Since we are emphasizing personal worship experience, frame
questions that relate to the personal nature of this experience.
What conclusions can you draw about your own encounters
with God in the light of Paul's experience?

WORSHIP AND TEACHING (Titus 2).

   The early church had a number of functions. It saw as one of its
major purposes the continued upbuilding of the believers' faith.
Worship for the early church was both personal and corporate. It
included an outward teaching ministry, the purpose of which was to
win new converts and to establish firmly the faith of all believers in
Christ as the church's one foundation. The truth that Christ is the
cornerstone of God's spiritual temple is essential for us to remember
(Eph. 2:20; 1 Cor. 3:11).
   Paul addressed the teaching ministry of the church. "You must
teach what is in accord with sound doctrine" (Titus 2:1, NIV). Cor-
rect teaching was central to the worship experience of early Chris-
tians. (See Gal. 1:6, 7.)
   Use the study guide below to answer the questions about Titus 2:

   Observation: (What does the text say?)
   1. What topics were to be taught in the early church?

   2. What specific counsel was to be given to men and women?

   3. What were youth in the church to be taught?

   4. According to Titus, what does grace teach?

   5. What is the motivation for teaching truth?

   6. How can the church know it is teaching correctly?

   7. How should people feel about you as a church member?

    What activities in your worship service fulfill this teaching
 ministry? How could the teaching aspect of your worship serv-
 ices be improved? How do you know whether doctrine is "sound"?


   "It is the privilege of the watchmen on the walls of Zion to live so
near to God, and to be so susceptible to the impressions of His Spirit,
that He can work through them to tell men and women of their peril
and point them to the place of safety."—The Acts of the Apostles,
p. 361.

    How can we adapt Paul's curriculum for our church? What
 information does Titus 2 give for the content and practice of
 your worship services?

                                                                    75

MAKING SENSE OUT OF WORSHIP (Isa. 1:10-20).

   We have studied three passages that relate to worship. The Pente-
cost experience was a dramatic outpouring of the Holy Spirit to
empower the disciples for preaching the gospel to unbelievers. This
was a corporate worship experience that empowered the disciples for
their mission.
   Paul's conversion was dramatically individual. Though some-
times presented as a normative conversion experience, Paul's con-
version was unique. God called an unbeliever for a specific task by
giving him a direct revelation of Himself. The experience left Paul
both physically and spiritually shaken. His calling was secured and
his life changed.
   Titus 2 provides a basis for the teaching ministry of God's people.
Complete the inductive study of these passages:

     Interpretation: (What does the text mean?)
     1. Pentecost: Acts 2.
        Should we expect the same kind of experiences to happen
        now?

       What was the purpose of the outpouring of the Spirit?

     2. Paul's conversion: Acts 9.
        Can we always expect such a dramatic change in our lives?

       How was Paul treated by members of the early church?

     3. Titus's teaching: Titus 2.
        What should be taught to the church?

       What changes should good teaching produce?

   A number of other Bible passages improve our understanding of
corporate and individual worship. In the writings of the prophets,
righteous conduct and obedience are contrasted with empty ritual
(Isa. 1:10-20; Hosea 6:6; Micah 6:6-8; Jer. 6:20; 7:21-23). Jeremiah
was not opposed to the temple services as such, but he was concerned
with the attitudes of those who had made ritual a substitute for
obedience and righteousness. (Compare 1 Sam. 15:22, NRSV.)

   What is the relevance of Isaiah 1:10-20 to our worship prac-
tices today? Do we offer to God "meaningless offerings"? If so,
what are they? According to the passages you have studied this
week, what should be the focus of genuine worship?

APPLYING BIBLICAL PRINCIPLES OF WORSHIP (Rom. 12:1).

   Regarding Saul's conversion, Ellen G. White writes: "Important
principles are given us, which we should ever bear in mind. Saul was
brought directly into the presence of Christ      He arrested him in
his course and convicted him of sin; but when Saul asked, 'What wilt
thou have me to do?' the Saviour placed the inquiring Jew in connec-
tion with His church, there to obtain a knowledge of God's will."
—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 120.
   The church had a role to play in Paul's instruction and nurture.
Through the worship, study, and prayer of God's people, Paul was to
learn the mission, purpose, and power of the Holy Spirit. As the early
church fulfilled its role in the experience of Paul, so also we are to
nurture new members.

   Using the passages you have been studying this week, make
two applications for each that give direction for your life and for
the life of your church.

   Application: (What does the text mean to me?)
   1. Pentecost: Acts 2.
      For my spiritual life.

      For my congregation.

   2. Paul's conversion: Acts 9.
      For my spiritual life.

      For my congregation.

   3. Titus's teaching: Titus 2.
      For my spiritual life.

      For my congregation.

   Paul suggests that even life itself is a type of worship (Rom. 12:1).
The word therefore implies that the act of total commitment is a
response to all that has gone before. Life, not ritual, is part of the true
sacrifice of God's people. Christians believe that lifestyle issues are
important, but it is in the context of worship that these are best taught.

    Could choices about health, entertainment, and other lifestyle
 issues be regarded as part of our worship? If so, how would
 understanding worship in this intimate way be helpful in mak-
 ing choices about what is right or wrong?

                                                                        77
Friday                                                  March 1
FURTHER STUDY: See the following chapters in The Acts of the
Apostles: "Pentecost," pp. 35-46; "From Persecutor to Disciple,"
pp. 112-122; "A Consecrated Ministry," pp. 359-371. In connection
with worship, study also Ephesians 5; Matthew 9:13; 12:7.

    In the early church, problems about worship were common. Some
of the problems included: (1) the tone of worship and the confusion
that ensued when individual worship styles impeded the teaching
ministry of the church (1 Corinthians 14); (2) concerns that love was
not at the center of the church (1 Corinthians 13); (3) Gentiles
bringing their "Gentile" ways into the congregational life (Acts 15:19-
21). With each challenge, the early church focused on the true moti-
vation for worship—the death and resurrection of Jesus.
   "The apostle's [Paul's] earnest words of entreaty were not fruit-
less. The Holy Spirit wrought with mighty power, and many whose
feet had wandered into strange paths, returned to their former faith in
the gospel. . . . The name of God was glorified, and many were added
to the number of believers throughout that region."—The Acts of the
Apostles, p. 388.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. In what ways would your congregational life be different if
     the church heeded the biblical counsel about worship that
     you have discovered this week?

     2. What rituals of the Seventh-day Adventist Church need
        renewal of purpose or practice?

     3. What personal aspects of the worship experience do we
        need in order to understand God's will for our lives?

     4. How should the church react to new ideas and worship
        practices?

SUMMARY: By using the inductive method of Bible study, we
learned that God encounters believers through worship and continues
to build up the church by empowering the faithful to learn of His
mission and purpose. The Pentecost experience provides a unique
model for understanding the power of the Holy Spirit in qualifying
the disciples to spread the gospel. Paul's conversion experience shows
us the power of God in the lives of individuals who are willing to be
taught God's ways by church members. The counsel to Titus gives us
a model of the types of content the church can share with its member-
ship.

     ;EFR          Adventists Win With New Vision
                             Carole Ferch-Johnson

           When someone mentions the Solomon Islands, Adventists of-
       ten remember exciting stories of the early work and great faith of
       the islanders. On some islands more than 30% of the population is
       Seventh-day Adventist, some third and fourth generation. But
       many no longer attend church.
           Recently a training program was run in the islands to encour-
       age the islanders to assume responsibility for leadership in the
       local church in both worship and outreach. This includes work-
       ing to reclaim missing members.
           To put their new skills into practice, the newly-trained leaders
       decided to begin visiting ex-Adventists. They usually know us
       and are friendly and easy to talk with. The group wrote the names
       of the former members on a black board—a total of 26 people. The
       new leaders formed pairs, and a name was delegated to each pair.
           Two women recognized the name of one young woman. Four
       years ago, this girl had left the village as a very happy, young
       bride. Her husband had a good job, which earned an excellent
       salary. They both enjoyed the benefits of their high income.
       When she saw how money benefitted them, she decided to take a
       job as well. In her absence her husband was attracted to another
        woman in the town; the bride decided to find a boyfriend also.
        When she became pregnant her husband chased her away. She
        turned to her father for support, but he was not prepared to help
        her. She had to go back to her village and her family.
           Disgraced and embarrassed, she would not attend church. Too
        ashamed to work in the garden, she stayed in her parents' house.
        In due time, a baby boy was born, but she did not take him to
        church for fear of criticism.
           The two Adventist women from the training group visited this
        young woman and told her, "We love you, and God loves you.
        We apologize for not being here to support you when you needed
        us. Please come to church with us on Sabbath. We will sit with
        you." The young mother responded and has never missed Sabbath
        School or church since. Her little boy loves Sabbath School and is
        learning that Jesus loves him too.
           Love and acceptance has helped this woman to renew her
        connection with the church.

   KEY THOUGHT: The-Bible contains numerous stories of men and
women who struggled to learn about God in the midst of the great
controversy between Christ and Satan. They were learning to live to-
gether in community. They had some of the same problems we have. The
biographical method of Bible study helps us to identify the successes of
Bible characters and allows us to apply to our lives what they learned
from God.

   LEARNING ABOUT THE PEOPLE OF THE BIBLE. Using the
biographical method of Bible study, we look closely at the character and
trials of a person's life. We try to become so acquainted with the
characters that we feel we are their friends. We learn something of their
problems and victories.
   Peter will be the focus of our study as we explore the biographical
method of Bible study. This method can provide years of enriched Bible
exploration. By studying Peter we get a chance to look into our own lives
through the eyes of this fisherman of Galilee.
   Review the calling of Peter in Matthew 4:16-21. In what order did
Jesus call the disciples? What do you think the personality of a fisherman
was like? Can we draw a picture of Peter's attitudes and style from this
brief description of his calling?

COLLECTING INFORMATION ABOUT PETER (Matt. 14:22-
32).

   The basic steps in a biographical study of a personality in the Bible are
as follows:
    1. Learn all you can about the person you wish to study:
       Select someone in whom you are interested. Start with a
       person who can be studied in a few hours. The attempt is to
       understand that individual in a personal way. Try to live in his
       or her shoes for a time. Investigate how that person thought
       and made decisions, and see what the Bible says motivated
       and directed his or her life.
    2. Make a list of your first impressions of the Bible charac-
       ter: Using the reference tools available to you, list all the
       references you can about the person. Discover as much as
       possible about his or her life. Note social background, parents,
       decisions, reactions, biases, personal gifts, and accomplish-
       ments. Note the events associated with the person's life.
    3. Examine the personality and character qualities that influ-
       enced the individual's relationship with God: Review the
       references you have found, making notes on each passage.
       Then draw conclusions about the person's character.
    4. Identify biblical truths exemplified by the life you are
       studying: For example, does the person live by the Bible truth
       that by "beholding" we are "changed" (2 Cor. 3:18)?
    5. Make a personal application of the information you have
       learned about the Bible character: The final step is discov-
       ering what you can learn from the person's life that can help
       you in your life of faith. You can ask, "Do I see myself in the
       life of the person I have selected?"

    Using a Bible concordance, look up all the references about Peter's
life as a disciple of Jesus. Some of the passages you will find are:
Matt. 14:22-36; 16:13-28; 17:1-8, 24-27; 18:21-35; 26:33-58, 69-75;
Acts 2:14-41. Begin to gather any other texts in the New Testament
that throw light on Peter's character development.


   "The Bible gives the true seeker an advanced mental discipline, and
he comes from contemplation of divine things with his faculties enriched;
self is humbled, while God and His revealed truth are exalted."—Sons
and Daughters of God, p. 108.

   What experiences in Peter's life provide a rich resource for
 understanding our own problems and victories?

                                                                          81

LISTING FIRST IMPRESSIONS (John 1:37-44).

   Peter's original name came from the Hebrew name translated
"Symeon" (Acts 15:14; 2 Peter 1:1), the Greek version of which trans-
lates as "Simon." We know little about Peter's home life except for the
fact that he was married (Mark 1:30) and that his wife accompanied him
on some of his missionary travels (1 Cor. 9:5). The Gospel of John
reveals that his hometown was Bethsaida Julias (John 1:44), situated on
the northeastern shore of the Sea of Galilee. During Jesus' ministry,
Peter's place of residence was Capernaum (Mark 1:21, 29). This is where
Jesus encountered him and called him to the ministry. At both locations
Peter had abundant opportunity to meet with Gentiles. Simon spoke
Aramaic with a strong north-country accent (Mark 14:70).

   How did Peter first hear about Jesus, and what were the circum-
stances of his call to be an apostle? John 1:37-42.


   It was at his call that Simon received from Jesus his new name Cephas
(Aramaic Kepha), meaning "rock" or "stone" (John 1:42; compare 1 Cor.
1:12; Gal. 2:9). The Greek translation of the name is "Petros," Peter.
Little did Peter know how significant his symbolic name would be later
on in his ministry.
   In the New Testament, forty-four chapters refer to the disciple Peter.
We will select certain major events in his life and explore their meaning,
using the biographical method of Bible study. We will look at Peter
mainly in the book of Matthew. You may wish to compare the stories
about Peter with those in the other Gospels.

   Review the following passages in Matthew that refer to Peter:
Matt. 4:18; 14:22-33; 16:13-23; 17:1-13, 24-27; 18:21-22; 26:33-58,
69-75. Begin to make some notes about Peter. Write out the first
impression you have of him. Then write down some basic observa-
tions and important information you discover about him. Are there
any problems, questions, or difficulties you wonder about as you
read these references? Be sure to note the events that were important
to Peter's faith development. Notice the discussion with Jesus at
Caesarea Philipi about Jesus' identity. Answer the following ques-
tions:
   1. During Jesus' ministry, what questions did He ask Peter?

     2. What difficulties did Peter have, learning to believe?

     3. What was the effect on Peter's faith of his experience of
        walking on the water?

GAINING INSIGHT AND MAKING A TIME LINE (Matt. 16:13-
23).

  Referring to passages mentioned in Monday's lesson, identify the
major events in Peter's life, and mark them on the time line below:



   After identifying the major events in Peter's life, make a list of any
personality traits or character qualities that helped or hurt Peter's
relationship with God.


    Peter was one of the first disciples called by Jesus to work in the new
kingdom of God that Jesus was announcing. He also belonged to the inner
circle of Jesus' disciples. He was close to Jesus and to the other dis-
ciples—especially James and John (Mark 5:37). One of Peter's most
prominent characteristics was his quick, impulsive nature. This produced
the best and worst in his life as he learned about Jesus' mission and future.
   "The eye of Christ rested upon him, reading his character and his life
history. His impulsive nature, his loving, sympathetic heart, his ambition
and self-confidence, the history of his fall, his repentance, his labors, and
his martyr death, the Saviour read it all."—The Desire of Ages, p. 139.

   Which of Peter's character qualities were helpful in building a
sense of community in a congregation? What qualities have you
discovered in Peter that might hinder the work of God in a commu-
nity?


   Use the study guide below to list what you see as Peter's identifying
characteristics. Your responses may be both positive and negative. Often
negative characteristics turn out to be positive when given to God to
develop.

LEARNING BIBLE TRUTHS THROUGH PETER'S LIFE (Matt.
26:31-35, 69-75).

   Next we will see how Bible truths are illustrated in Peter's life. We
will look at four of Peter's experiences and identify Bible truths that
seemed to guide him.

     1. Peter walks on water (Matt. 14:22-36). It seems inconceiv-
        able that Jesus would give the title rock to someone with the
        problems Peter exhibited. Jesus saw far beneath the surface
        and detected an inherent strength hidden by the inconsistent
        mannerisms that appeared externally. Peter's experience helps
        us to understand our own insecurities. We should learn to be
        secure in God's love, for in it we can be delivered from our
        fears. (See Prov. 3:23-26; 1 John 4:18, 19.)
     2. Peter identifies Jesus (Matt. 16:13-23). Peter's confession
        of Jesus' messiahship was followed immediately by a declara-
        tion revealing misunderstanding of His mission. Jesus said
        that the confession was a gift from God, "for this was not
        revealed to you by man" (verse 17, NIV). "The truth which
        Peter had confessed is the foundation of the believer's faith. It
        is that which Christ Himself has declared to be eternal life."
        —The Desire of Ages, p. 412. Later, when Peter thought to
        control Jesus' ministry according to his own understanding,
        he revealed his limited insight.
     3. Peter denies Jesus (Matt. 26:31-35, 69-75). Matthew 16
        records Peter's certainty that Jesus was the Son of God. But
        during Jesus' trial, another spirit manifested itself. Jesus knew
        who He was. When questioned whether He was the Christ,
        Jesus replied, "I am" (Mark 14:62). But not only did Peter
        deny Christ's identity, he made strenuous efforts to hide his
        own. Faith without works was truly dead in this instance! The
        crowing of the rooster awakened his faith.
     4. Peter preaches about Jesus (Acts 2:14-45). After the resur-
        rection, Peter's focus was singular, his faith secure. On the
        Day of Pentecost, the power of the Holy Spirit motivated him
        to present a carefully crafted review of Jesus' Lordship. Early
        church teaching was centered on this truth. Earlier in his
        ministry, Peter had difficulty focusing on Jesus' real mission
        and identity.

    What observations can you make, based on Peter's life, that will
 benefit church members in their search for faith? How can the
 community of believers find the same determination that Peter even-
 tually manifested? What role does the Holy Spirit play in this?

MAKING A PERSONAL APPLICATION (Acts 2:14-41).

   Frequently, Bible authors do not state whether an example is good or
bad. Certainly, there are many excellent examples of faithful living
(Enoch, Abel, and many others). But sometimes we are left in uncertainty
about what lessons we are to learn from the people about whom we read.
God allowed both positive and negative characteristics to be recorded in
the Bible in order to provide us realistic examples of life.
   For example, the story of Jonah depicts a prophet running away from
God, rather than facing possible failure in a foreign country. What are we
to learn from this brief, unusual, and often pathetic story of God's
prophet? The author of the story does not tell us very clearly. We are left
to interpret the information in the story—but always with the Holy
Spirit's guidance.
   Likewise, we look at Peter and try to draw conclusions that will assist
our personal and our community's faith. Where he failed, we can learn
about overcoming; where he was successful, we can learn to look to Jesus
as the helper and motivator of our faith. Studying Bible characters gives
us a realistic view of people struggling to live as God's children.

   Of the following passages about Peter, ask the questions listed
below in order to make a personal and community application of
their content: Matt. 4:18; 14:22-36; 16:13-23; 17:1-8, 24-27; 26:33-
58, 69-75; Acts 2:14-41.

   1. Did you see anything of yourself in Peter's life and ac-
      tions? Did Peter reveal any of your weaknesses? Did he
      reveal any of your strengths? If so, which ones?
   2. Did you see anything that could help members of your
      congregation in their lives of faith?
   3. Did you see any of the church's strengths in Peter's life?
   4. What do you intend to do about what you have learned
      concerning Peter's life, struggles, and victory?
   5. What happened in Peter's life that might happen in your
      life to make you a witness for Jesus? What must happen in
      the church for this to take place?


    "Peter was naturally forward and impulsive, and Satan had taken
advantage of these characteristics to overthrow him. Just before the fall of
Peter, Jesus had said to him, 'Satan hath desired to have you, that he may
sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and
when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.' Luke 22:31, 32."
—The Desire of Ages, p. 812.


                                                                         85
Friday                                                     March 8
FURTHER STUDY: Read The Desire of Ages, " 'We Have Found
the Messias,' " pp. 132-143 and "By the Sea Once More," pp. 809-
817. For more Bible references to Peter, see John 13:6-9, 24; 18:10-
27; 20:2-7; 21:15-22.

   During Peter's lifetime the church grew rapidly. Gentiles were incor-
porated into the life of the Christian community. The Jewish community
began to be isolated because of its rejection of the Messiah. Peter's
powerful witness broadened the arms of the church to enfold more than
the early Jewish congregations. His vision, recorded in Acts 10:9-23, is a
classic model of how God reveals His message for the church. Peter's
preaching had focused on the Jewish community. God recognized that
something dramatic must happen to convince Peter that he should open
his heart to other believers. After all, the missionary work of the apostle
Paul was beginning in Asia Minor, and soon the church would become
more Gentile than Jewish. God revealed to Peter that the good news is for
everyone, of whatever race, background, culture, or profession.
   Study Peter's vision and subsequent visit to the home of Cornelius
(Acts 10, 11). Note the baptism of the first Gentile converts to the
Christian church. Ask the following questions of the passage:

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Why was this such a dramatic vision for Peter?

     2. What did the church need to learn from this vision that it
        had not yet accepted?

     3. How does this vision help us to build a sense of community
        and openness to others within our church?

     4. What commands in this passage should all Christians heed?
        What have you learned about your openness to others?
        What will you do differently?

SUMMARY: A biographical study of Peter reveals the struggles of a
person growing in faith. Through his early life of trial, we catch
glimpses of an emerging, trusting relationship with Jesus. Peter's life
gained specific focus and direction after he was empowered and
enlightened by the Holy Spirit. Finally, he understood God's mes-
sage and purpose for the world. Peter's life provides insight into our
struggles to grow in understanding of, and fellowship with, Jesus.
The church will be blessed as more Peters enter into their final
commitment to Christ.

                                The Falling Idols
                                    Emmeline Liu

            Chia-yi is a large city in southern Taiwan known for its temples.
         Temples devoted to Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and many
         others dot the city. Nearly every family has at least one idol niche
         in its home. It is hard to find a Christian church in Chia-yi, and
         missionaries who have gone there have often left, disappointed.
             In 1993 a Global Mission team entered Chia-yi. We bought a
         four-story building to use as a church. Two big temples stand in
         front and back of our new church. A few Adventists moved to
         Chia-yi to strengthen the work there. And God blessed us. As a
         means to get acquainted with people, we held a health screening.
         Many people came, and some signed up for the Bible courses.
             Amy Chang was one who signed up. Amy, an elementary
         school teacher, studied the Bible course carefully. Soon she agreed
         to study the lessons with me. She fell in love with God and
         accepted Jesus as her Saviour. She accepted the Bible truths we
         presented and joined our small group worshiping on Sabbath.
             After studying several months, Amy decided to be baptized.
         But she worried about the ancestors' niche in her living room.
         Before she came to our church, she and her husband had wor-
         shiped at the niche every day. Now her husband worshiped at the
         ancestors' niche alone. Amy's husband loved her very much, but
         he made it clear that her Christian friends were not welcome to
         visit in their home. He refused to attend our programs, and would
         not attend Amy's baptism. But we all joined Amy in praying for
          her husband.
             Following her baptism, Amy went home from the church, and
          found that some sacred papers, which were kept in the wooden
          ancestors' niche, had fallen to the ground. When Amy's husband
          saw the papers, he picked them up and put in a drawer, not back
          into the niche. Amy wondered what her husband's action meant.
          Then not long ago, Amy discovered that her husband had taken
          the ancestors' niche off the wall. Her husband is giving up his
          ancestor worship!
             After two years in Chia-yi, we have 15 to 24 people worshiping
          in the little church every Sabbath. Some are new interests and
          students of the English Language School, pleasant, searching young
          people who are longing for the truth.
              Pray for the work in Chia-yi, for its new converts, and for those
          who are still searching.

             How to Do a Bible
                 Word Study
              '\\N




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Lev. 19:11-16; Psalm 12;
Prov. 30:5, 6; Matt. 5:13-16; 20:26; Luke 10:29-42; Rom. 6:15-
23.

     MEMORY TEXT: "And the King will answer and say to
     them, 'Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of
     the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me' " (Matthew
     25:40, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: This lesson seeks to demonstrate the effec-
tiveness of Bible word studies. The word we will study is service.
One way the gospel becomes real to others is by acts of kindness,
compassion, and unselfishness performed by those who value the gift
of salvation and fulfill their responsibility to the world.

    WHAT IS SERVICE ALL ABOUT? Service can take many
forms. It may be practical service to those in need, service of various
kinds for the church, witnessing to the centrality of Jesus in our lives,
or teaching others God's special message for the last days. Whatever
it is, we place ourselves at God's disposal to be His instruments.
Service is part of our sanctification; we are set apart to be used by
God. Service can bring peace to families, communities, churches,
and to our own lives through presenting Jesus as the answer to human
need. Service implements mercy and justice in our relationships with
others.

HOW TO DO A STUDY ON THE WORD SERVICE (Psalm 12;
Prov. 30:5, 6).

   This week we will explore the word-study method of Bible study.
The Bible was originally written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek,
languages that most Christians do not know. But we can still do word
studies using the various resources available today, which can clarify
the meanings of words and their use in the Bible.
   The word-study approach involves a close look at the meaning,
origin, and occurrences of a single word in the Bible. We try to find
out how a word is used, to learn what the word means in the particu-
lar Bible contexts in which it is found. The same word may have
different meanings in different contexts. Hence, it is important to
find out what the Bible writers meant when they used the word so
that we can accurately interpret each passage in which the word
occurs. Only then can we be correct in the application of each
passage to our lives, to the church, and to the world.

   What does Psalm 12 tell us about the importance of God's
words for our lives? Proverbs 30:5, 6 uses a metaphor about the
effectiveness of God's words. Interpret the meaning of this pas-
sage as it relates to the topic under consideration.


   The steps in this method of Bible study include:
   1. Choosing a word to study. You should choose words you
      have questions about, ones in which you are interested.
   2. Identifying its English meaning and then comparing Bible
      translations of passages in which the word is used. Write
      down the different meanings of the word to see whether there
      are any patterns of meaning that develop.
   3. Identifying the exact meaning of the word in each Bible
      passage in which it is used. How does the meaning of the
      word influence the meaning of the passage? You may wish to
      use other tools in your study at this point. For English readers,
      Strong's Exhaustive Concordance is an invaluable aid in do-
      ing word studies. Bible dictionaries and commentaries may
      also be helpful. With the help of such tools, determine how
      many times the word occurs in the Bible. What is its origin
      and its original meaning? In what books does it occur? Sort
      out the various meanings of the word throughout Scripture.
   4. Determining how the word has changed in meaning with
      the passing of time. What does it mean in different contexts
      or situations?
   5. Applying its meaning to your life.

                                                                     89

DEFINITIONS AND COMPARISONS (Lev. 19:11-16).

   The word we are focusing on this week is service. Our task is to
understand this term in the Bible and to make an application of its
meaning to the church and to our personal spiritual lives. According
to Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition, the word
service has various meanings: "the occupation or function of serv-
ing," "employment as a servant," "the work performed by one who
serves," "contribution to the welfare of others," "a form followed in
worship or in a religious ceremony," etc.
   When we think of serving or service, we usually think of volun-
tary or compulsory work done for another person. Various kinds of
service were expected of servants and slaves in Bible times. In
religious terms, we often think that service should be "faithful" and
"humble." Usually we do not think of the reward we might receive
after the work is performed. People who serve are in a position of
dependence. Their freedom is limited because of commitment to the
one being served.
   We think of service as having various categories or types, such as
voluntary service for the community, service as a just response to
God's calling for one's life, or simply personal help to someone else.
Service is often a part of our mission statements as we attempt to
make practical our understanding of God's actions in our lives.

   What are the usually accepted understandings of the term
service in your congregation? What are the ways that service is
seen in your family?


   "None need wait until called to some distant field before begin-
ning to help others. Doors of service are open everywhere. All around
us are those who need our help. The widow, the orphan, the sick and
the dying, the heartsick, the discouraged, the ignorant, and the out-
cast are on every hand.
   "We should feel it our special duty to work for those living in our
neighborhood. Study how you can best help those who take no
interest in religious things. . . . This is just as essential as to save the
benighted souls in foreign countries."—The Ministry of Healing,
p. 152.

    Using Leviticus 19, identify what it means to serve. In the
 laws of Moses, identify the concern for others the Lord wishes
 us to have. Using a concordance and other Bible translations,
 identify other meanings of the term service. What is the rela-
 tionship between service and love?

THE BIBLE MEANING OF SERVICE (Luke 10:29-42).

   Sometimes in the Old Testament the term for "service" refers to
the work of servants in the court, as seen in the book of Esther
(Esther 1:10-12; 2:2; 6:1-5). Sometimes it refers to service rendered
by one person for another (Gen. 29:18-20). Often the word for "serv-
ice" implies sacred service, work related to the worship of the Lord,
but not confined to the priesthood (Exod. 31:10; 2 Chron. 35:15, 16).
   In the New Testament, the English verb to serve translates three
different Greek words, which have the following meanings: (1) To
serve in the sense of carrying out religious duties (Greek latreuo:
Matt. 4:10; Luke 1:74; Heb. 9:14); (2) to serve in the sense of being
subjected to, or in bondage to someone; to obey; to be enslaved,
whether willingly or by force (Greek douleuo: Matt. 6:24; Rom. 6:6;
7:6, 25); (3) to serve in the sense of waiting on someone, to care for
someone, to help or support someone, to serve as a deacon or deacon-
ess (Greek diakoneo: Luke 10:40; 12:37; Acts 6:2).

   What conclusions do you reach about the biblical usage of the
concept of service in the following texts? Matt. 20:27; 25:44, 45;
Luke 4:39; 10:29-42; John 12:2; Rom. 15:30-33; 1 Cor. 11:17-34;
2 Cor. 8:3, 4; Phil. 2:5-11. How is the concept of slavery used in
the Bible?


   The Old Testament refers to the service of slaves. Freedom was
provided after six years of service. (See Exod. 21:2 and Deut. 15:12.)
God enacted laws to control the conduct of slave masters and to
render the lot of the slaves bearable. God was not responsible for
slavery, and His Word condemns the terrible cruelties of the modern
slave trade.
   In Bible times, God acted to bring a human institution in line with
His law of love. In the New Testament, slavery takes on a uniquely
Christian connotation. Slaves were given more status. In some of His
parables, Jesus put slaves in positions of responsibility and command
(Matt. 24:45). Paul's counsel to the slave owner Philemon provides a
new basis of relationship between servant and master.
   Jesus Himself took the form of a servant (Phil. 2; compare Gal.
3:13). Thus, Jesus taught that in order to be first in His kingdom,
one must be a servant to others (Matt. 20:27). By becoming one in
Christ, we learn how to serve as He did. (See The Desire of Ages,
p. 21.)

   How can you apply Jesus' concept of service in the setting in
 which you find yourself?

                                                                    91
Wednesday                                              March 13
THE BIBLICAL MEANING OF SERVICE (Matt. 20:26; Rom.
6:15-23; Gal. 5:13; 6:10).

   The Bible suggests that one way to define the church would be as
a servant. Jesus said, "Even the Son of Man did not come to be
served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many" (Mark
10:45, NKJV). Much of the church has failed to come to terms with
the basic principle behind those words. Even when the words have
become familiar, even when they are often cited, they are often
applied only to relationships between Christians. We miss the truth
that the church is to fill a servant role in the world, as Jesus did. We
are to serve, not only the brotherhood and sisterhood, but everyone.
(See Gal. 6:10, NKJV.)
   To say that the church is in the world as a servant is also to say
that we are here to give, not to get. We are here to give, with no
strings attached; to help people because they have a need and we
have the resources, not because we hope to gain something.

  What can your church do to serve the community? How are
you a part of this service model of ministry?


   "Again and again Jesus had tried to establish this principle among
His disciples. When James and John made their request for pre-
eminence, He had said, 'Whosoever will be great among you, let him
be your minister.' Matthew 20:26. In My kingdom the principle of
preference and supremacy has no place. The only greatness is the
greatness of humility. The only distinction is found in devotion to the
service of others."—The Desire of Ages, p. 650.
   Service is the most profound definition of the mission of Jesus'
kingdom in the Bible. Service is the primary function of the church.
This includes teaching others the truth, leading them to submit their
lives to Christ, and providing a place where hurting people can be
healed.
   Jesus did not extract a doctrinal statement from people before He
healed them. Nor did He go to them afterward and say, "Now you
owe Me one." He healed them because they were sick; He did so
knowing that some of them would never follow Him all the way. The
body of Jesus, His church, will continue the work He began.

    After reading in your Bible about service and servants, what
 can you conclude about your special God-given responsibilities
 in life? What steps can you now take to fulfill these responsi-
 bilities?

APPLICATIONS FOR OUR LIVES (Matt. 5:13-16; 6:1-4; 1 John
3:11-19).

   "We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love
our brothers. Anyone who does not love remains in death" (1 John
3:14, NIV). To understand service, we must understand love. The
words that point us to compassion for others also point to the motiva-
tion for that concern—the love of Jesus in our lives.

   Apply your understanding of service to your own life. Finish
the following sentence: "I think that I should . . ." What ideas do
you have to begin service activities and positive ministry for
members of your home? How can you begin to serve in your
church? Your community?


   According to 1 John 3, the evidence that we are children of God is
our love for others. This passage says that if love is lacking, we
"remain in death." Then we are not sons and daughters of God, no
matter what experiences we may have had in the past. We must put
love into action. Talking about the truth of love will not do; action is
needed. Service is evidenced by compassionate servanthood.
   Today the church needs to make a bold commitment to love
people and then dedicate itself to fulfilling that promise. The lifestyle
of the church should tell people that they are loved. All levels of the
church family need to experience it. God's love for us does not
merely amount to good feelings about us. He gave Himself for us in a
death in which we do not have to participate. This willing commit-
ment motivates us to act on His behalf.
    This kind of giving cannot be compensated. Christ's kind of love
is foreign to our culture. Most of the time we give to others only to
have our love reciprocated. In God's kingdom others are loved first,
in the spirit of Jesus.
    "To those who receive the spirit of this service, it can never
become a mere ceremonial. Its constant lesson will be, 'By love
serve one another.' Gal. 5:13."—The Desire of Ages, p. 651.
    It is the duty of church members, who have been set free from the
slavery of sin by Jesus' death and have experienced the freedom of
salvation, to assume the role of servants (Matt. 20:27). Sacrifice for
others becomes a pleasure, giving for their salvation not merely a
 duty but a genuine joy.

    Conclude this word study of service by writing applications
 of a practical nature for your life. What are you going to do
 about this concept of love and service?

                                                                      93
Friday                                                March 15
FURTHER STUDY: Read Eph. 6:5-9; The Desire of Ages, " 'The
Least of These My Brethren,' " pp. 637-641; "A Servant of Serv-
ants," pp. 642-651; The Acts of the Apostles, "The Gospel in Sa-
maria," pp. 110, 111.

   "Hundreds, yea, thousands, who have heard the message of salva-
tion are still idlers in the marketplace, when they might be engaged in
some line of active service. To these Christ is saying, 'Why stand ye
here all the day idle?' and He adds, 'Go ye also into the vineyard.'
Matthew 20:6, 7. Why is it that many more do not respond to the
call? Is it because they think themselves excused in that they do not
stand in the pulpit? Let them understand that there is a large work to
be done outside the pulpit by thousands of consecrated lay members.
   "Long has God waited for the spirit of service to take possession
of the whole church so that everyone shall be working for Him
according to his ability. When the members of the church of God do
their appointed work in the needy fields at home and abroad, in
fulfillment of the gospel commission, the whole world will soon be
warned, and the Lord Jesus will return to this earth with power and
great glory."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 110, 111.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What do you think of this saying: "To be a Christian is to
     have your heart broken by the things that break the heart
     of God"?

     2. Describe a person you know who exemplifies the biblical
        model of compassion.

     3. What ideas can you suggest that could be used in your own
        church to create a "servant" model of leadership and mis-
        sion?

     4. What kind of personal preparation do you need before you
        can be a witness in the world through acts of compassion
        and concern?

SUMMARY: This week, through the word-study method, we learned
that we can be so concerned about our own personal religious experi-
ence that, in the process, we forget about others. We become so self-
absorbed that we forget the biblical concept of servanthood. Jesus
died for us, not only to give us a way to heaven. He lived and died in
order to model how we might make a difference in the world. He
wants us to illustrate the nature of His kingdom by our attitudes and
actions.

                                       A Ministry of Love
                                         Charlotte Ishkanian

           Maria Drach is a woman with a mission—to reach out to others
       in the city of Sochi, Russia. She is constantly looking for ways to
       draw people to the love of Jesus and into the arms of the church.
           Since her husband died three years ago, Maria works as an
       accountant to provide for her three sons. "The Lord provides
       everything I need, so I gladly do what He wants me to do," she
       smiles.
           Today 20 people came to Maria's tiny apartment for dinner
       after church. They sat on the floor to sing and tell stories. One
       woman had never been to an Adventist church before. Maria
       invited her home for lunch, then to the afternoon evangelistic
       meeting in a rented movie house where the church meets.
           Maria often leads out in the afternoon evangelistic meetings.
       She presents flowers to those who are celebrating birthdays, their
       baptism, or other significant milestones. Today Maria invited
       people who would like to follow Jesus to come forward. The
       woman Maria had invited to the meeting joined the group at the
       front. "I have never had such a wonderful day in my life," she
       testified. Maria wondered if the woman felt pressured to come
       forward, but the woman said, "No, you did not pressure me to
       come. You invited me. I came because I wanted 10."
           Maria looks for people with needs that she can supply. During
        recent evangelistic meetings, Maria felt a burden for handicapped
        people. She wanted to invite them to the meetings but did not
        know where to find them. When she met a woman in a wheelchair,
        Maria asked her for names of other people confined to wheel-
       chairs. She made friends with them and invited them to the meet-
        ings. Many wanted to go, but they had no way to get there.
           Maria rented a bus and brought the people to the meetings.
                                About 30 handicapped people came, and
                                eight wheelchair-bound people were bap-
                                tized. The relatives were amazed that some-
                                one would do this for their loved one; no
                                one had ever cared for their spiritual needs
                                before.


                                             Maria Drach is an active laywoman in
                                          Sochi, Russia. Charlotte Ishkanian is editor
                                          of the Mission quarterlies.

     Study of Bible Teachings




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Gen. 2:1-3; Exod. 20:8-11;
Mark 2:28; Matt. 24:20; Isa. 58:13, 14; Rom. 15:4.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Pray that your flight may not be in winter
     or on a sabbath" (Matt. 24:20, NRSV).

   KEY THOUGHT: This week we discover the overall teaching of
the Bible on a particular doctrine (teaching). We will investigate the
Bible doctrine of the Sabbath.

    REPEAT JESUS' TEACHING AND PRACTICE. Jesus out-
lined the work of His followers until His second coming: "teaching
them to obey everything that I have commanded you" (Matt. 28:20,
NRSV). Jesus' teaching includes the entire Word of God (2 Tim.
3:16). Therefore, when we seek to discover Jesus' teaching on a
particular Bible doctrine, we investigate that doctrine throughout the
entire Bible.
    For example, on the doctrine of the Sabbath, the first step is to
look up every text in the Bible that mentions the Sabbath. With the
help of a concordance, study all the Sabbath passages. This is a time-
consuming but very rewarding process. Having listed and examined
all these passages, the next step is to organize them under subhead-
ings suggested by the Bible discussion of the Sabbath.
    In this lesson, we will assume that all Bible texts dealing with
the Sabbath have been examined. The subheadings that we will
consider are: (1) What is a Sabbath? (2) Which day is the Sabbath?
(3) Should we still keep the Sabbath? (4) How should we keep the
Sabbath? (5) How do we apply the Bible Sabbath doctrine to our
situation today?

WHAT IS A SABBATH? (Gen. 2:1-3).

    The theological method of Bible study is the process of discover-
ing what the Bible says about a topic or doctrine and then explaining
it in a systematic, well-organized way.
    Using this method, we will develop a "theology," or a doctrine, of
the Sabbath. This kind of theology is called "systematic" because
you systematically search for all the texts in the entire Bible that deal
with a topic and then group them into natural units of thought.
    There are five steps in theological study: (1) deciding on a doc-
trine or subject to study; (2) collecting the Bible information;
(3) organizing the material in a systematic way; (4) writing a theo-
logical statement based on the Bible information; (5) drawing con-
clusions, including applications to your personal and spiritual life.

   Note how the following passages answer the question What is
a Sabbath?
Gen. 2:1-3: God rested on and "sanctified" (KJV) or "hallowed"
   (NRSV) the seventh day of Creation week. Thus God set the
   Sabbath apart for a holy use.

Exod. 16:4, 5, 22-26: The seventh day was observed before Sinai as
  "a day of solemn rest, a holy sabbath to the Lord" (verse 23,
  NRSV).

Exod. 20:8-11: Sabbath keeping is commanded as a memorial of the
  six days of Creation.

Deut. 5:12-15: The Sabbath is a memorial of Israel's deliverance
  from Egyptian bondage.

Luke 4:16; Acts 16:12-15: A day of worship and witnessing.

   God gave us the weekly Sabbath as a day of rest and worship for
the specific purpose of reminding humanity that He is the Creator
and the Redeemer. As He delivered Israel from slavery in Egypt, so,
through Christ, He delivers us from the slavery of sin (Col. 1:13, 14).
The Sabbath is a perpetual memorial of both Creation and redemp-
tion, and these two purposes of the Sabbath will continue until the
end of time and throughout eternity. In describing Jesus' Sabbath
observance and that of the apostles, the Bible writers never suggest
that the seventh-day Sabbath has now been abolished or replaced.

   Does your Sabbath observance reflect the two purposes for
 which God instituted the Sabbath?

                                                                       97
Monday                                                March 18
WHICH DAY IS THE SABBATH? (MARK 2:28).

   Is God particular about which day we should keep? Why can't we
observe one day in seven, irrespective of which day it is? How do we
know that the seventh day of the week in our era is the same seventh
day that Jesus and the, apostles kept? How do we know that it is the
day on which God rested at the end of Creation week?

  Note how the Bible addresses these questions:
Rev. 1:10: The Lord has a day. This was the day on which John was
  in vision on the island of Patmos (compare Isa. 58:13; God calls it
  "my holy day").

Mark 2:28: The Lord's day is the Sabbath day that was observed by
  the Jews.

Gen. 2:1-3; Exod. 20:8-11: The Sabbath day is the seventh day, the
  day on which God rested and the day that the fourth command-
  ment stipulates as "holy."

Luke 23:54-24:3, 7 (compare Mark 16:9): The seventh day is the day
  after crucifixion Friday and before resurrection Sunday.

    The seventh-day Sabbath, observed by Jesus' disciples after His
death, was the day after the "preparation" day on which Jesus was
crucified. We know that Jesus was crucified on Friday because He
"rose again the third day" (1 Cor. 15:4; compare Luke 24:7), and He
rose on Sunday. The word preparation used in Luke 23:54 is a
translation of the word that in modern Greek means the sixth day or
Friday. Arndt and Gingrich's Greek lexicon comments that the word
for "preparation" means "Friday, on which day everything had to be
prepared for the Sabbath, when no work was permitted."—p. 627.
(Note: The Passover preparation day and the preparation day for the
weekly Sabbath were the same day in the year on which Jesus was
crucified.)
    The next day after crucifixion Friday, Jesus' followers "rested the
sabbath day according to the commandment" (Luke 23:56). Follow-
ing that, Jesus rose early on the first day of the week (Luke 24:1-3;
compare Mark 16:9).
    So the Sabbath is the day after Friday and the day before Sunday.
No calendar changes have ever modified the weekly cycle. From the
beginning of time, the same seventh day has been observed by those
loyal to God's law. The seventh-day Sabbath in the twentieth century
is the same day of the week as the seventh-day Sabbath in Jesus' day
and throughout the Old Testament period.

SHOULD WE STILL KEEP THE SABBATH? (MATT. 24:20).

   Does the fourth commandment apply to Christian believers after
the cross? Did Jesus' apostles keep the Sabbath after His resurrec-
tion? Did Jesus command His followers to observe the Sabbath until
His second advent? Does God's last-day message to the world in-
clude instruction regarding Sabbath observance?

   The following Bible passages we have discovered dealing with
the Sabbath enable us to answer these questions:
Compare Exodus 20:8-11 with New Testament passages that speak
   of the continuing obligation of Christians to obey the Ten Com-
   mandments: Rom. 3:31; 7:7, 12, 14; 8:3, 4; James 2:10-12; 1 John
   2:4; Rev. 12:17; 14:12.

Acts 13:14, 15, 42-44. Paul and Barnabas met with the people and
  preached on two Sabbath days.

Acts 16:12-15. Paul held a religious service by the riverside on the
  Sabbath day.

Acts 17:1, 2. According to his custom, Paul went to the synagogue on
  three Sabbaths of which we have record.

Acts 18:1, 4, 11. Paul preached every Sabbath for eighteen months;
  he observed 78 Sabbaths.

Matt. 24:20. Jesus instructed His disciples to observe the Sabbath
 through the great tribulation involved in the destruction of Jerusa-
 lem, approximately 40 years after His resurrection. The same
 instruction applies to God's people at the end of time, who will be
 pursued by their enemies. This text is part of Jesus' interpretation
  of Daniel's prophecy regarding the "little horn" power (Matt.
  24:15; Dan. 8:13, 14, 25; 9:27; 11:31; 12:11). The little horn
  functions until the end of time. As the Christians fled from pagan
  Rome in A.D. 70 and observed the Sabbath, so God's last-day
  people will flee from their enemies and observe the Sabbath.

Rev. 14:6, 7. The first angel's message is the "everlasting" (KJV), or
  "eternal" (NRSV), gospel. It includes the instruction that we "wor-
  ship him who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of
  water" (verse 7, NRSV, last part). This is an obvious allusion to
  the fourth commandment: "For in six days the Lord made heaven
  and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but rested the seventh
  day" (Exod. 20:11, NRSV).

                                                                   99
Wednesday                                               March 20
HOW SHOULD WE KEEP THE SABBATH? (Isa. 58:13, 14).

  The following scriptures answer the question:
Exod. 20:8-11; Deut. 5:12-15: Neither believers, their relatives, their
  servants, their visitors, nor their cattle are to work on the Sabbath
  day. All are to rest and remember the Creator and Redeemer.

Exod. 31:12-17: The Sabbath is to be observed as a memorial of
  God's work of creation and sanctification (making His people
  holy). Such observance of the Sabbath involves worship. Since
  Israel was a theocracy (ruled directly by God), God's direct com-
  mand for the punishment of Sabbath breakers could then be ap-
  plied. In modern times, living under secular governments, we
  leave the punishment of Sabbath violators to God. (See Heb.
  10:26-31.)

Lev. 23:32: "From even unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath."
  "Even" is sunset. (See Mark 1:21, 32; Neh. 13:19.)

Isaiah 58:13, 14: We are to regard the Sabbath as a "delight"; we are
   to honor the Lord's holy day; "not doing thine own ways, nor
   finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words" (verse
   13). The Sabbath is to be a day of communion with God and with
   other believers. It is not a day for secular work, selfish pleasure, or
   conversation about everyday matters.

Jer. 17:19-27: Writing shortly before the Babylonian invasions, Jer-
   emiah warned that Sabbath breaking, conducting secular business
   on the Sabbath, would result in the destruction of Jerusalem and
   captivity. Sabbath violation was one of the main reasons that the
   Lord allowed His people to be taken captive by Nebuchadnezzar's
   armies (605, 597, 586 B.C.).

Ezek. 20:10-24: Ezekiel warned that failure to observe the Sabbath
  would lead to rejection by God.

Neh. 13:15-22: Nehemiah refused to allow any secular business on
  the Sabbath day.

Matt. 12:1-8; Mark 3:1-6; Luke 13:10-17; 14:1-6; John 9: Jesus
 taught and demonstrated that it is God's will for believers to
 supply human need and relieve suffering on the Sabbath day. But
 Jesus in no way contradicted the instruction regarding the Sabbath
 given by Old Testament prophets. (See Matt. 5:17-19.)

APPLYING THE BIBLE SABBATH DOCTRINE TO OUR-
SELVES (Rom. 15:4).

   Every method of Bible study concludes with a summary of the
teaching discovered in the Word of God and direct application of that
teaching to our lives.

  How does this week's study of the Bible Sabbath doctrine
apply to the situations in which Seventh-day Adventist believers
around the world are living?


   Each believer must study the Bible instruction and apply it to his
or her own heart and life. We offer the following suggestions that
grow out of the Bible counsel:
   1. Our Sabbath worship services should exalt our Creator and
      Redeemer as the Lord of our lives (Exod. 31:13).
   2. All our activities on the Sabbath day should contribute to our
      fellowship with God and with one another (Mark 2:27, 28).
      The Sabbath is an excellent time for evangelistic outreach
      (Acts 16:13-15).
   4. Relief of human need and suffering is appropriate activity for
      the Sabbath day (Matt. 12:1-14).
   5. No secular business (buying or selling) or work is to be per-
      formed on the Sabbath day. Working to make a living is to be
      done on the six other days of the week (Neh. 13:15-22).
   6. The Sabbath is not a time for the pursuit of personal pleasure
      and secular conversation, unrelated to spiritual fellowship with
      God (Isa. 58:13, 14).
   7. Secular studies should not be engaged in on Sabbath (Exod.
      20:8-11; Isa. 58:13, 14).

   "God has given us His commandments, not only to be believed in,
but to be obeyed. . . . The Sabbath was made for man, and God would
have him put by his labor on that day, as He Himself rested after His
six days' work of creation. Those who reverence the commandments
of Jehovah will, after light has been given them in reference to the
fourth precept of the Decalogue, obey it without questioning the
feasibility or convenience of such obedience. God made man in His
own image and then gave him an example of observing the seventh
day, which He sanctified and made holy. He designed that upon that
day man should worship Him and engage in no secular pursuits. No
one who disregards the fourth commandment, after becoming en-
lightened concerning the claims of the Sabbath, can be held guiltless
in the sight of God."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, p. 247.

                                                                   101
Friday                                               March 22
FURTHER STUDY: On the question of Sabbath observance after
the second coming of Jesus, study Isaiah 66:22, 23. On the relation-
ship between Sabbath observance and reception of God's end-time
seal, compare: Exod. 31:13, 17; Ezek. 20:12, 20; Rom. 4:11; Rev.
7:1-3; 14:1-5.

   "Those who would have the seal of God in their foreheads must
keep the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. This is what distin-
guishes them from the disloyal, who have accepted a man-made
institution in the place of the true Sabbath. The observance of God's
rest day is the mark of distinction between him that serveth God and
him that serveth Him not."—Ellen G. White Comments, Seventh-day
Adventist Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 970.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. In the light of the Bible teaching regarding the Sabbath, if
     the state demands that we engage in activities that violate
     God's holy day, how should we respond?

   2 There are many borderline activities that some church
     members regard as Sabbath breaking and some regard as
     appropriate Sabbath activities. What are the Bible prin-
     ciples that should guide our decisions on such matters?

   3. A friend with whom you are studying the Bible complains
      that accepting and practicing the Sabbath truth would
      involve his losing his job. What counsel would you give
      him?

   4. In the light of your study this week, how would you explain
      the relationship between Sabbath observance and right-
      eousness by faith?

SUMMARY: Following the Bible-study method that seeks under-
standing of a Bible doctrine or teaching, we have discovered impor-
tant truth regarding the Sabbath. The Sabbath day is God's memorial
of His creative and redemptive work. The seventh-day Sabbath is to
be observed by God's faithful people until the end of time. We are to
observe the Sabbath as the Scriptures instruct; it is a day of worship
and fellowship, from which secular work and pleasure is excluded.
Sabbath observance is a crucial aspect of our righteousness-by-faith/
grace relationship with God, and it is an inseparable part of the
lifestyle of those who will receive the end-time seal of God.

                  New Life From Death-1
                            Mirta Vigna

   Sundar, a tall, dark-haired boy of 13, picked flowers from his
mother's garden in Kathmandu, Nepal. Tears ran down his cheeks.
Inside the house Sundar's mother cried with loud, sorrowful
wails. Nearby lay the still body of a small girl.
    It was time to prepare the funeral pyre. The family carried the
body to the funeral site. Sundar placed the flowers around his
sister's body. Then a torch touched the dry wood on the pyre, and
the body was burned.
    When Sundar's sister became ill, Father had called the witch
doctors to offer animal sacrifices to appease the gods and assure
that Little Sister would get well. But Little Sister died.
    Three weeks later Sundar's brother was dead. The family's
grief seemed endless. The gods in whom they had believed had
not answered their prayers. Desperate, Father and Mother began
searching for a god who would hear their prayers.
    Sundar's uncle had given Father a New Testament. It lay
forgotten in a corner. But now, with their gods no longer listening
to their prayers, Father began to read the Bible. Suddenly he
called his wife to listen. "Come to me, all you who are weary and
burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and
learn from me, for I am .gentle and humble in heart, and you will
find rest for your souls" (Matt. 11:28-30, NIV). As father read
these words his heart was comforted.
    Eagerly he searched for other words from the great God of the
Bible. One day he found this promise: "'Where, 0 death, is your
victory? Where, 0 death, is your sting?' The sting of death is
sin. . . But thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through our
Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Cor. 15:55-57, NIV).
    People asked Sundar's father why he read the Bible when he
had many other gods to worship. He answered, "When my chil-
                           dren were sick we prayed and sacrificed
                           to the gods. They did not hear our prayers.
                           They cannot heal the sick or bring peace.
                           But the God of the Bible can heal the sick.
                           He even raised the dead. His book helps
                           me to know Him."               (continued)

                            Sundar Thapa is chaplain, and Mirta
                         Vigna is a doctor at Scheer Memorial
                         Hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal.

      Study of Bible Prophecy




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Rev. 3:14-22.

   MEMORY TEXT: "Knowing this first, that no prophecy of
   the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the proph-
   ecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of
   God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost" (2 Peter
   1:20, 21).

   KEY THOUGHT: Bible prophecy strengthens our faith and en-
lightens us in regard to our Christian duty in the light of events
predicted to occur in the future.

   BIBLE PROPHECY IS OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE that God
exists and that the Bible is His inspired revelation. (See I Peter 1:16-
19.) It is often pointed out that it is not possible to prove the existence
of God or the inspiration of the Bible. The Christian faith is precisely
that, a religion of faith. Even so, the Lord has not left us without
strong supporting evidence to strengthen our faith. Fulfilled Bible
prophecy is one of the greatest evidences that our faith in God, our
confidence in the saving power of Jesus Christ, and our belief in the
messages of His Word are based on objective realities. (See Isa. 46:9,
10.)
   Study of Bible prophecy involves first identifying the kind of
prophecy being studied: prophecy with a local application only (Ezek.
26:7), prophecy with dual applications (Jeremiah 4), or apocalyptic
prophecy that focuses on the end-time (Daniel 2). In the study of
apocalyptic prophecy, it is important to interpret the symbolism by
the use of similar symbolism used elsewhere in Scripture. As in all
kinds of Bible study, the Bible is its own interpreter.

THE SPIRITUAL STATE OF THE CHURCH (Rev. 3:14-17).

    Daniel and Revelation are the Bible's two prime examples of
apocalyptic prophecy. This kind of prophecy focuses on the end of
human history, is based on visions and dreams, and makes a large use
of symbolism. Sometimes the symbols used in any one prophecy are
interpreted for us (Daniel 2, 7, 8). But the symbols in many proph-
ecies are not interpreted. For example, we are left to interpret the
symbolism in the prophecy of the trumpets (Revelation 8 and 9) on
the basis of Scripture and history.
    Seventh-day Adventists have consistently interpreted apocalyptic
prophecy by identifying, wherever possible, fulfillments in history.
Daniel gives the sweep of history, covering Babylon, Medo-Persia,
Greece, Rome, and the papacy, culminating in end-time events (Daniel
2-9). Because the futurist school of prophetic interpretation fails to
recognize historical fulfillments, it fails to identify accurately end-
time applications.
    Our purpose in this lesson is to study the prophecy regarding
Laodicea, the last-day church (Rev. 3:14-22). The seven churches
represent seven periods of church history. (Compare Rev. 1:1, 3, 19.)
The symbolism used within each church applies dramatically to a
particular period of history. Yet the message to each church is rel-
evant to every stage of history.
    The name Laodicea may mean "a people judged." It is a combina-
tion of two Greek words: laos, meaning "people," and dikaios,
meaning "righteous." Hence, Laodicea may also mean "a righteous
people." The name prefigures the pre-advent judgment and the
righteous condition of responsive believers, who are justified and
 vindicated by Jesus Christ.

   Compare other Bible passages that parallel John's description
of the last-day church: "Neither cold nor hot. . . . You are luke-
warm. . . . You are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked"
(Rev. 3:15-17, NRSV). Compare Lev. 18:24-30; Jer. 3:1-10; Hosea
10:1, 2; Amos 6:1; Matt. 22:11-13.


    "The Lord has shown me in vision some things concerning the
church in its present lukewarm state, which I will relate to you. . . .
Said the angel to the church: 'Jesus speaks to thee, "Be zealous and
repent.' " This work, I saw, should be taken hold of in earnest. There
is something to repent of. Worldly-mindedness, selfishness, and cov-
etousness have been eating out the spirituality and life of God's
people."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1, p. 141.


                                                                   105

"GOLD REFINED BY FIRE" (Rev. 3:18, NRSV).

   Why does the Lord counsel us "to buy" from Him (Rev. 3:18)?
Isa. 55:1-4; Matt. 13:44; 25:8, 9.


   "Christ is represented in the Scriptures as a gift. He is a gift, but
only to those who give themselves, soul, body, and spirit, to Him
without reserve. We are to give ourselves to Christ, to live a life of
willing obedience to all His requirements. All that we are, all the
talents and capabilities we possess, are the Lord's, to be consecrated
to His service. When we thus give ourselves wholly to Him, Christ,
with all the treasures of heaven, gives Himself to us. We obtain the
pearl of great price.
   "Salvation is a free gift, and yet it is to be bought and sold. In the
market of which divine mercy has the management, the precious
pearl is represented as being bought without money and without
price."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 116.

   How do the following passages interpret the phrase "gold
refined by fire so that you may be rich" (Rev. 3:18, NRSV)?

1 Peter 1:7-9

James 2:5, 14-17

Gal. 5:6

   Laodiceans think they are rich because they are "increased with
goods, and have need of nothing" (Rev. 3:17). They do not realize
that material possessions or even advanced knowledge are inad-
equate to supply the soul's need and qualify them for eternal life with
Christ. Jesus dramatized the pitiful Laodicean condition in the par-
able of the rich fool (Luke 12:16-21). His fields produced so abun-
dantly that he built larger barns to contain the grain. Then he regaled
himself with relaxation, drink, and merriment. But the Lord pro-
nounced sentence upon him. His life was about to end. "So it is with
those who store up treasures for themselves but are not rich toward
God" (Luke 12:21, NRSV).
   "The gold tried in the fire is faith that works by love. Only this can
bring us into harmony with God. We may be active, we may do much
work; but without love, such love as dwelt in the heart of Christ, we
can never be numbered with the family in heaven."—Christ's Object
Lessons, p. 158.

"WHITE ROBES TO CLOTHE YOU" (Rev. 3:18, NRSV).

  What do white robes represent in the book of Revelation?

Rev. 3:4, 5

Rev. 6:11

Rev. 7:9, 13, 14

Rev. 12:1

Rev. 19:7, 8

Rev. 22:14 (RSV)

    The symbol of white robes is common in Scripture. The earthly
high priest and his sons wore "holy garments" (Exod. 28:2), includ-
ing a linen robe (Lev. 16:4; Exod. 28:39, 40). Isaiah spoke of God's
gift of "the garments of salvation," "the robe of righteousness" (Isa.
61:10). Jesus explained that the individual not wearing a "wedding
garment" will be cast out of the kingdom of grace (Matt. 22:11-13).
He alluded to the pre-advent judgment, during which the final deci-
sions are made regarding who is clothed in His righteousness and
who is not. (See Dan. 7:9-14; 12:1.)
    The apostle Paul referred to believers in Christ as having "put on
Christ" (Gal. 3:27). The "new man" is "put on" (Eph. 4:24). We must
"put on the whole armour of God" (Eph. 6:11). Thus Paul gives the
unmistakable impression that the character of Christ is to be worn by
believers, in the sense that Christ's indwelling is their righteousness.
(See Rom. 8:9, 10; Gal. 2:20; Eph. 5:27.)
    In the book of Revelation, the white robes represent both vindica-
tion in the pre-advent judgment (Rev. 6:11) and Christ's character
bestowed upon His people and manifested in their good works (Rev.
3:5; 19:7, 8).
    "The white raiment is purity of character, the righteousness of
Christ imparted to the sinner. This is indeed a garment of heavenly
texture, that can be bought only of Christ for a life of willing obedi-
ence."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, p. 88.
    "By the wedding garment in the parable [Matt. 22:1-14] is repre-
sented the pure, spotless character which Christ's true followers will
 possess. . . . Righteousness is right doing, and it is by their deeds that
 all will be judged. Our characters are revealed by what we do. The
 works show whether the faith is genuine."—Christ's Object Lessons,
 pp. 310-312.

                                                                       107

"SALVE TO ANOINT YOUR EYES" (Rev. 3:18, NRSV).

   What light do the following passages throw on the meaning of
the "eyesalve" (KJV)?

Ps. 119:18, 105

John 14:26; 16:8-15

Eph. 1:18

Eph. 3:16-19

1 John 2:20, 27

   When our spiritual eyes are opened, we can discern between truth
and error, purity and impurity. But all our unaided efforts to increase
our spiritual discernment are doomed to failure. Spiritual eyesight
does not result from human knowledge, intellectual enlightenment,
or emotional excitement. Jesus taught that only as we are enlightened
by the Holy Spirit can we see as God would have us see. Knowledge
of the Word is indispensable to the Christian, but that knowledge is
spiritually impotent unless fashioned and activated by the teaching
ministry of the Holy Spirit.
   "Therefore we need to be exceedingly careful, and walk humbly
before God, that we may have spiritual eyesalve that we may distin-
guish the working of the Holy Spirit of God from the working of that
spirit that would bring in wild license and fanaticism. 'By their fruits
ye shall know them' (Matt. 7:20). Those who are really beholding
Christ will be changed into His image, even by the Spirit of the Lord,
and will grow up to the full stature of men and women in Christ
Jesus. The Holy Spirit of God will inspire men with love and purity;
and refinement will be manifest in their characters."—Selected Mes-
sages, book 1, p. 142.
   "The eyesalve is that wisdom and grace which enables us to discern
between the evil and the good, and to detect sin under any guise. God
has given His church eyes which He requires them to anoint with
wisdom, that they may see clearly; but many would put out the eyes
of the church if they could; for they would not have their deeds come
to the light, lest they should be reproved. The divine eyesalve will
impart clearness to the understanding. Christ is the depositary of all
graces."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 4, pp. 88, 89.

    How can you be sure to receive daily the gold, the white
 raiment, and the eyesalve of which Jesus spoke?

CHRIST IS KNOCKING AT YOUR HEART'S DOOR (Rev.3:19-
22).

   Study Bible passages that enable you to understand more fully
the following sentences:
"I reprove and discipline those whom I love" (Rev. 3:19, NRSV):
   Heb. 12:3-11.

"Be earnest, therefore, and repent" (Rev. 3:19, NRSV): Acts 5:31;
  Rom. 2:4; 2 Tim. 2:25.

"I am standing at the door, knocking" (Rev. 3:20, NRSV): Song of
   Sol. 5:2; Luke 12:36; 13:25.

"I will come in to you and eat with you, and you with me" (Rev. 3:20,
   NRSV): John 14:18, 23; 15:26; 16:13.

"To the one who conquers I will give a place with me on my throne,
  just as I myself conquered and sat down with my Father on his
  throne" (Rev. 3:21, NRSV): Rev. 2:7, 17, 26; 1 Peter 2:21, 22;
  1 John 3:3.

   The latter part of the message to Laodicea is one of the most
inspiring passages in the Bible. Here is hope for the hopeless, en-
couragement for the desponding, life for the dying. Jesus' love is
demonstrated by His rebuke and discipline (verse 19). He does not
discipline us in anger, as human parents sometimes do, but in tender
love and forgiveness for our human frailties. He pleads with us to
repent (verse 19), something we can do only through the empowering
ministry of the Holy Spirit. He alone can give us genuine sorrow for
sin and the power to turn away from it. Jesus' promise of the Spirit
(John 14-16) rings in our ears and engenders a grateful response.
   Jesus' standing without, knocking at our heart's door (verse 20),
arouses the most tender mental images of our caring Lord. Our sin
bars the door to His healing presence. But, through the power of His
imparted grace, we can remove the pile of rubbish that prevents us
from opening to Him. Then He enters and nourishes our fainting
souls. He communes with us through the gentle ministrations of the
Holy Spirit and empowers us to rise above the demands of our fallen
humanity. By this means we can conquer as He conquered (verse 21).
His presence in our hearts by the Holy Spirit enables us to live above
sin, to overcome as He did, and to reflect His goodness.

    Have you received the Saviour into your heart? Have you
 responded to His knocking?

                                                                  109
Friday                                                 March 29
FURTHER STUDY: In connection with the promise to the over-
comer in Laodicea, study the following passages: Matt. 19:28; 25:31;
Luke 1:32, 33; 1 Cor. 6:2; Heb. 8:1, 2; Rev. 5:10; 20:4. Read
Testimonies for the Church, vol. 1, pp. 141-146.

   "The mansions in glory are His, and the joy of that heavenly
abode; yet He humbles Himself to seek an entrance at the door of
your heart, that He may bless you with His light and make you to
rejoice in His glory. His work is to seek and to save that which is lost
and ready to perish. He wishes to redeem as many as He can from sin
and death, that He may elevate them to His throne and give them
everlasting life."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2, p. 224.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How can we determine whether the rebuke to Laodicea
     regarding spiritual lukewarmness applies to us individu-
     ally?

   2. What relationship do you see between this quarter's les-
      sons on Bible study and the message to Laodicea?

   3. What connection do you see between the counsel of Rev-
      elation 3:18 and the teaching of the Epistle to the Romans?

   4. A member of your church is often ready to point the finger
      of criticism at others, but apparently unaware of his own
      weaknesses. How can you help him without giving the
      impression that you are judgmental and self-righteous?
      How does the message to Laodicea suggest a tactful ap-
      proach to this man?

SUMMARY: Study of symbolic Bible prophecy involves careful
interpretation of each symbol by comparing other passages that em-
ploy the same symbolism. Using this method, we have discovered the
meaning of the symbols used in the message to the church of Laodi-
cea. The heart of the message is Christ's willingness to impart to us
faith that works by love, the gift of His indwelling righteousness, and
the spiritual enlightenment of the Holy Spirit, who clarifies the Word
for us. As we daily open our heart's door, Jesus comes in to dwell
with us and to empower us for vibrant Christian living.

                         New Life From Death-2
                                   Mirta Vigna

            After his brother and sister died, Sundar's family quit offering
        sacrifices to their idol gods. They realized that gods made by
        hands could not answer prayers. Father began searching for a god
        to believe in. He found a dusty New Testament and started reading
        it. There he discovered promises of a God who cares for humanity,
        who hears and answers prayers.
            One day Sundar saw his father go into the family temple behind
        the house and throw away the idols. Sundar knew his father had
        found hope in the God of heaven.
            A year passed, and as the family read the New Testament and
        learned more of the God of the Christians, they found joy and
        happiness that they had never known before.
            There was no Christian church or place to worship in the
        village, so Sundar's uncle and his parents started a fellowship
        group in their home. A few neighbors and relatives began to attend
        the group also. Even though they had no one to teach and guide
        them in their new faith, they read the Bible and prayed together.
        Then the group began praying for someone to teach them more
        about Christianity and God.
            In answer to their prayers they met an Adventist pastor. The
        little group invited the pastor to teach them the Bible. The pastor
        gladly studied with the group, and soon both Sundar and his father
        accepted Jesus Christ as their only God and personal Saviour.
        Now they understood the love of God for humanity. This wonder-
        ful God let His own Son die so that they could be free them from
        the bondage of sin.
            The pastor suggested that Sundar attend Spicer Memorial Col-

         barrier, but finally he decided to go. When he completed his

                                 about good health principles and about the
                                 Christian God who hears their prayers.
