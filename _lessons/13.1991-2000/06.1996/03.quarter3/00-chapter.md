             End-Time Landmarks
                   Good News for Our Day

    This quarter we will study some of the most important landmarks
of the faith taught in Scripture and believed by Seventh-day Adventists.
By landmarks we mean prominent Bible teachings that have direct
relevance to our salvation and that enable us to detect and avoid
religious errors and spiritual delusions.
    Writing in 1889, Ellen White endorsed the righteousness-by-faith
message that had been presented to the church at the Minneapolis
General Conference session the year before. She briefly outlined the
"old landmarks" to which the Adventist church is committed:
    "The passing of the time in 1844 was a period of great events,
opening to our astonished eyes the cleansing of the sanctuary tran-
spiring in heaven, and having decided relation to God's people upon
the earth, [also] the first and second angels' messages and the third,
unfurling the banner on which was inscribed, 'The commandments
of God and the faith of Jesus.' One of the landmarks under this
message was the temple of God, seen by His truth-loving people in
heaven, and the ark containing the law of God. The light of the
Sabbath of the fourth commandment flashed its strong rays in the
pathway of the transgressors of God's law. The nonimmortality of
the wicked is an old landmark. I can call to mind nothing more that
can come under the head of the old landmarks."—Counsels to
 Writers and Editors, pp. 30, 31.
    According to this passage, there are five "old landmarks": (1) the
pre-advent judgment; (2) the three angels' messages; (3) the law; (4)
the Sabbath; and (5) the mortality of the soul. The significant fact is
that the message preached in 1888 was intended to place each of
these landmarks in the context of righteousness and salvation by faith
in Jesus Christ. Christ and His saving grace are central to the Advent
message. The landmark truths have relevance to life only as Christ is
seen in them.
    We begin this quarter's lessons by reviewing Bible teaching re-
garding righteousness by faith in Christ. We then consider other
aspects of the first angel's message: the earthly sanctuary services as
 types or analogies of Christ's heavenly mediatorial and judgment
 ministries; the law; and the Sabbath. We study the second and third
 angels' messages in relation to last-day events and in relation to
 special counsel given to God's last-day people. The doctrine of the
 soul's mortality points us to the great truth of the resurrection at the
 second coming of Jesus.
    "Faith in God's word, prayerfully studied and practically applied,
 will be our shield from Satan's power and will bring us off conquer-
 ors through the blood of Christ."—Testimonies for the Church, vol.
1, p. 302.
                                                                        5
Lesson 1                                          June 30—July 6

              Christ the Focus
               of Scripture




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S LESSON: Luke 24:27, 44; Isa. 7:14;
9:6, 7; Ps. 2:1-12.

     MEMORY TEXT: "And beginning at Moses and all the
     prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the
     things concerning himself" (Luke 24:27).

  KEY THOUGHT: Because all Scripture focuses on Christ, all
Bible teaching is best understood in the light of the cross.

    CHRIST DEMONSTRATED THAT THE SCRIPTURES POINT
TO HIM. His crucifixion shattered the hopes of His disciples. In the
afternoon of His resurrection day, two of His followers walked the
seven miles from Jerusalem to the village of Emmaus (Luke 24:13).
Jesus demonstrated that His ministry is the central theme of the Old
Testament (Luke 24:27).
    Later in the evening, Jesus appeared to the eleven apostles (Luke
24:36). Again He explained that every section of the Hebrew Scrip-
tures points to His life and ministry. The Law of Moses (Luke 24:27)
is the Pentateuch, the five books of Moses. The prophets are the four
"former" prophets (Joshua, Judges, [1 and 2] Samuel, and [1 and 2]
Kings) and the four "latter" prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and
the Twelve Minor Prophets considered as one book). The Psalms, or
Writings, include the remaining 11 books, of which the book of
Psalms was regarded as the first. (See SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1,
p. 37.)
    Christ in all the Scriptures is the theme of this lesson.

CHRIST IN THE FIVE BOOKS OF MOSES (Luke 24:27, 44).

   What passages from the writings of Moses may Jesus have
referred to as He taught the two disciples on the way to Emmaus?
Study the Christ-centered significance of the following passages:

Gen. 3:15, 21

Exod. 12:1-14

Num. 21:4-9

Num. 24:17

Deut. 18:15

   Genesis 3:15 is the first gospel text. Even that first reference to
Christ speaks of His death. Christ is the true "seed" of the "woman"
(Gal. 3:16, 17). His death provided a mortal wound to Satan and his
pretensions (John 12:31; 1 John 3:8).
   "As soon as there was sin, there was a Saviour. Christ knew that He
would have to suffer, yet He became man's substitute."—Ellen G.
White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 1084.
   Before Israel left Egypt, God initiated the Passover service. The
blood of the slain lamb was placed on doorposts and lintels (Exod.
12:5-14) as a type of the blood of Christ (1 Cor. 5:7).
   The bronze snake (Num. 21:4-9), held up on a pole to which dying
Israelites were to look, symbolized Christ as our sin-bearer on Cal-
vary. He took our place. He became sin for us (2 Cor. 5:21; 1 Peter
2:24).
   Balaam's prophecy regarding a "star" that would "come forth out
of Jacob" (Num. 24:17, RSV) foreshadowed the birth of the Messiah
(Matt. 2:2).
   Christ met all the conditions of Moses' prophecy regarding "a
prophet" like himself (Deut. 18:15; compare John 6:14; 7:40). Moses
was a type of Christ.

   In the light of the Messianic prophecies in the five books of
 Moses, what impression do you think Jesus' words had on the
 two disciples who were walking to Emmaus? What impressions
 do the New Testament applications of Moses' predictions have
 on you? What relationship do you see between Revelation 13:8
 and the prophecies in the Pentateuch?



                                                                    7

CHRIST IN THE WRITINGS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT
PROPHETS (Isa. 7:14; 9:6, 7).

  What references from the prophets do you think Jesus could
have used during the walk to Emmaus?

Isa. 7:14

Isa. 9:6, 7

Isa. 42:1-7

Isa. 52:13-53:12

Micah 5:2

   Sometimes referred to as "the gospel prophet," Isaiah provided
many inspired forecasts of the Messiah's ministry and sacrificial
death. Isaiah foresaw the miraculous birth of "Immanuel, God with
us." (Compare Isa. 7:14 with Matt. 1:22, 23.) Isaiah predicted that the
Messiah would be the Deity (Isa. 9:6; compare John 14:8-11) and that
He would occupy David's throne for eternity (Isa. 9:7; compare Luke
1:32, 33). Filled with the Spirit, the Messiah would perform a loving
ministry of releasing sin-bound people from Satan's dominion (Isa.
42:1-7; compare Matt. 12:18-21). Isaiah forecast the Messiah's sacri-
fice for all human sin (Isa. 50:5, 6; 52:13-53:12; compare the Gos-
pels' accounts of Jesus' trial and death).

  Study the following passages that also speak of the Messiah's
ministry and death. Find applications of these passages in the New
Testament:

Jer. 23:5, 6

Zech. 9:9

Zech. 13:7

Isa. 50:4-11

Mal. 3:1

   Jesus directed attention to the Old Testament as a witness to Him-
self. He said, "These are the Scriptures that testify about me" (John
5:39, NIV). Peter reiterated the same point (1 Peter 1:11).

CHRIST IN THE PSALMS, THE WRITINGS (Ps. 2:1-12).

   The third section of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) to which
Jesus referred (Luke 24:44) was called the Writings (kethubim). Since
the book of Psalms was the first book of the Writings, the whole
section was often called the Psalms. The book of Daniel was included
in this section of the Hebrew Bible.

   What passages from the Psalms may Jesus have used during
the walk to Emmaus? Notice the New Testament application of the
following passages:

Ps. 2:1-12; compare Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:5

Ps. 16:8-11; compare Acts 2:25-28

Ps. 22:1, 8, 16, 18; compare Matt. 27:35, 43, 46

    The Bible study Jesus gave the two disciples on the way to Emmaus
must have been very comprehensive. "He interpreted to them in all
the scriptures the things concerning himself' (Luke 24:27, RSV).
They didn't complain that Jesus used too many texts! They testified,
 " 'Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road,
while he opened to us the scriptures?' " (verse 32). Undoubtedly He
referred to Daniel 9:24-27, which predicted the dates of the Messiah's
baptism and crucifixion.
    It was easy for Jesus to expound the Scriptures in this way. He had
inspired the Old Testament prophets to write their messages, and He
had led His people for centuries. "All the communion between heaven
and the fallen race has been through Christ. It was the Son of God that
gave to our first parents the promise of redemption. It was He who
revealed Himself to the patriarchs. Adam, Noah, Abraham, Isaac,
Jacob, and Moses understood the gospel. They looked for salvation
through man's Substitute and Surety. These holy men of old held
communion with the Saviour who was to come to our world in human
flesh; and some of them talked with Christ and heavenly angels face to
 face."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 366.
    How privileged we are to have New Testament interpretations of
the Old Testament messages. The Holy Spirit revealed to New Testa-
 ment prophets the Christ-centered significance of Old Testament pas-
sages.

   Have you found Christ in the Old Testament as well as in the
 New? As you have listened to Christ speak to you in His Word,
 how has your life been enriched?

                                                                     9

CHRIST IS CENTRAL TO THE NEW TESTAMENT (Eph. 4:21).

   How does Scripture compare Christ with the prophets? Heb.
1:1, 2.


   "In these last days [the gospel age] he has spoken to us by his Son"
(Heb. 1:2, NIV). The teachings of Christ were circulated orally for
some years after His resurrection. Then the writings of the New
Testament prophets (the apostles) began to appear. Every one of these
writings contains messages "spoken to us by his Son." The Gospels
record the life and teachings of Jesus. The epistles reiterate His teach-
ings, the messages He gave while on earth, and the same basic mes-
sage that was given in Old Testament times.
   "His sayings were to the disciples as a new revelation. . . . He was
but unfolding the old truths, long obscured. . . . He appealed to the Old
Testament Scriptures, laying open in a clear light the spiritual bear-
ings of truths that had become obscured through tradition and misin-
terpretation."—Signs of the Times, Feb. 29, 1892, p. 3.

   How is Christ depicted in the book of Revelation?

Rev. 1:1

Rev. 1:12-18

Rev. 5:6-10

Rev. 6:15, 16

Rev. 19:11-16

   The whole book of Revelation is Christ's testimony about Himself.
He is the heavenly High Priest, who, having won victory over sin and
death, is able to impart light, strength, and deliverance to His strug-
gling people. He is the victorious Lamb before the throne, the repre-
sentative of humanity, and the world's Saviour. He is also the Deity
who opens the records of the future. He is the coming King, who
translates His believing followers to the heavenly kingdom and de-
stroys those who have identified themselves with sin.

    As you study the New Testament, what do you see mainly—a
 set of theological propositions or a Saviour from sin? Why is it
 important that all our doctrinal understandings be shaped by
 our realization of their Christ-centered significance?

CALVARY, THE CENTER OF THE NEW TESTAMENT (Gal.
6:14).

   What is the central focus of the New Testament? Acts 4:8-12;
5:28-42.


    The records of Christ's death and resurrection occupy between a
quarter and a third of the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and
Luke) and half of John. These events constituted the heart of apostolic
preaching. Christ's death and resurrection made salvation available to
all humanity. They made possible His intercessory ministry in heaven,
His pre-advent judgment ministry, and the eternal reward to be be-
stowed upon the faithful at His return.

  What was the central focus of Paul's teaching? 1 Cor. 1:23; 2:2;
15:1-5; Gal. 3:1.


   After the brilliant young rabbi had found the Saviour, every Scrip-
tural truth took on new meaning. Paul now saw the Old Testament
sanctuary services as foreshadowing the sacrificial, mediatorial, and
judgment ministries of Jesus Christ. He saw salvation as God's gift,
not the believer's achievement. He realized that sinful human beings
can have the present assurance of salvation in Christ because of His
grace, counted and bestowed. He saw works of obedience to God's
law as flowing from hearts in tune with the Saviour, who bore the
penalty for their sin. Paul looked forward longingly to the consumma-
tion of all the believer's hopes when Jesus will come the second time.
   "The sacrifice of Christ as an atonement for sin is the great truth
around which all other truths cluster. In order to be rightly understood
and appreciated, every truth in the Word of God, from Genesis to
Revelation, must be studied in the light that streams from the cross of
Calvary."—Gospel Workers, p. 315.

   What is Christ's central role now that He has borne the penalty
for sin? John 12:32.


   Since every biblical truth must be studied in the light of the cross,
the most important focus in every sermon and Bible study should be
Christ and His saving work. As we study some of the landmark truths
of the Christian faith this quarter, we will discover Christ at the center
of every message.


                                                                      11

FURTHER STUDY: Read John 19:1-42 and "Calvary" in The Desire
of Ages, pp. 741-757.

    Allow your mind to grasp the glorious fact that Jesus died for you
because He loves you—not because you are good, but because He is
good. He treats you, not as you deserve, but according to your need. Is
there any greater good news than this? Is not this the very heart of the
gospel?
    Because we have the "everlasting gospel" to take to the world
(Rev. 14:6), our mission is to lift up Christ and Him crucified:
   "Christ crucified, Christ risen, Christ ascended into the heavens,
Christ coming again, should so soften, gladden, and fill the mind of
the minister that he will present these truths to the people in love and
deep earnestness. The minister will then be lost sight of, and Jesus will
be made manifest. Lift up Jesus, you that teach the people, lift Him up
in sermon, in song, in prayer. Let all your powers be directed to
pointing souls, confused, bewildered, lost, to 'the Lamb of God.' Lift
Him up, the risen Saviour, and say to all who hear, Come to Him who
`hath loved us, and hath given himself for us.' Let the science of
salvation be the burden of every sermon, the theme of every song. Let
it be poured forth in every supplication. Bring nothing into your
preaching to supplement Christ, the wisdom and power of God."
—Evangelism, p. 185.
   This entreaty is for every believer; all are ministers, or witnesses,
for Christ.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Because every teaching of the Bible is intended to be Christ-
     centered, how would you explain to a questioner the Christ-
     centered significance of tithing?

   2. How does emphasis on the Cross and the subsequent minis-
      try of Jesus Christ relate to a person's struggle to cope with
      life's challenges from day to day?

SUMMARY: Christ is the center of Scripture from Genesis to Rev-
elation. All Bible truth finds its center in the One who is "the truth"
(John 14:6). Just as spokes in a wheel meet in the hub, so the Bible
teachings we study this quarter find their center in Christ. These
doctrines tell us something about Jesus and draw us into closer union
with Him. Every Bible truth reveals a facet of Christ's character. As
we take our stand at Calvary, the Cross will open before our wonder-
ing gaze the deeper meaning of redemption through Christ.

                     The Closing Door
                            David Lin

   The Spirit of God is working in the hearts of people in China
to lead souls to Christ.
    Recently Brother Wong of Shanghai visited a group of
believers in a city in Honan Province and was asked to speak at
a Friday evening service. During the service someone noticed a
woman whom they had not seen before come into the meeting.
After the meeting he spoke to her and learned that she had been
invited to come before, but had never been interested enough to
attend. However, this evening she felt a strong inner urge that
forced her to come. She listened intently to the evening's
message.
    Later that same night this woman had a dream in which she
heard a voice saying, "Heaven's door is closing soon!" She did
not understand what that meant, so she went to her Christian
friend to enquire. Her friend told her that God had sent her that
warning because He wanted her to be saved. "The closing door
is the door of salvation," she explained. "Human probation will
soon close, so now is the time to come to Jesus, confess our
sins, and enter the door before it is closed forever."
    The woman was deeply impressed that God was so co-
 ncerned for her that He sent her a warning message. From that
day on she has attended our meetings regularly to learn more of
 the gospel of Jesus.
    Pray for our believers in China, that they will be faithful to
 witness to their friends, and for those who have never made a
 decision for Christ, that they will heed the Holy Spirit's
 warnings and commit their life to God.

   David Lin pastors an Adventist church in Shanghai that has
an average attendance of 800 each week.

   Christ Our Righteousness
         and Salvation




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: John 3:1-21.

   MEMORY TEXT: "For God so loved the world, that he gave
   his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should
   not perish, but have everlasting life" (John 3:16).

   KEY THOUGHT: The most important Bible landmark is the truth
of righteousness and salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.

   THE MESSAGE OF FAITH PERMEATES THE SCRIPTURES.
The first gospel promise (Gen. 3:14) implies that if the Seed of the
woman is accepted by faith, salvation will be readily available. Abraham
was saved by faith. Not only was his faith "reckoned [counted, im-
puted] . . . as righteousness" (Gen. 15:6, RSV), he became the father
of the faithful and the example of faith to all future generations.
   God repeatedly invited Israel to live by faith in Him and in the
coming Messiah. The New Testament teaching of the law written on
the heart reiterates Moses' message to his contemporaries. (Compare
Deut. 30:11-14 with Rom. 10:6-10.) The New Testament emphasis
upon circumcision of the heart was taught throughout the Old Testa-
ment period. (Compare Deut. 10:16; 30:6; Jer. 4:4; Rom. 2:28, 29.)
Paul's teaching of justification by faith reflects the injunction of
Habakkuk 2:4, "the righteous shall live by his faith" (RSV).
   This lesson follows the good news Jesus gave to Nicodemus. He
emphasized five important aspects of the life of faith: (1) the Cross;
(2) forgiveness; (3) righteousness counted; (4) righteousness bestowed;
(5) works.

THE CROSS (John 3:14-16).

   The cross was central to Jesus' message to Nicodemus. Those who
accept Christ's sacrifice for sin have the gift of eternal life. (Compare
John 3:16 with verse 36; 5:24.)

   Why does acceptance of Christ's sacrifice result in the immedi-
ate gift of eternal life? Isa. 53:6; 1 Peter 2:24.


   Jesus suffered the ultimate penalty for all human sin. There is only
one God (Deut. 6:4; Mal. 2:10; Eph. 4:5, 6), including the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Spirit. On the cross, infinite God the Son was
separated from infinite God the Father and infinite God the Holy
Spirit. The Deity was divided because of human sin. This is why
Jesus cried out in intense agony of spirit: "My God, my God, why hast
thou forsaken me?" (Matt. 27:46, RSV; The Desire of Ages, p. 753).
   The infinite suffering of the Deity on Calvary was sufficient to
atone for all human sin. We have freedom from guilt and the gift of
eternal life when we accept Jesus as Saviour and Lord.

   In the following passages, notice how the cross was central to
the teachings of the apostles:

1 Cor. 2:2

1 Cor. 15:1-4

Gal. 6:14

1 Peter 1:18-21

1 John 1:7; 2:2; 4:10

   Human philosophies are built on human reasoning, which, how-
ever logical, fails to answer the deepest human needs. By contrast, the
gospel speaks directly to the human dilemma and provides the ulti-
mate answer. On the cross, "God was in Christ, reconciling the world
unto himself' (2 Cor. 5:19). Paul was constrained (2 Cor. 5:14),
inspired, and motivated by the fact that Christ "died for all, that those
who live might live no longer for themselves but for him who for their
sake died and was raised" (2 Cor. 5:15, RSV).

   Is the story of the cross only a historic event for you, or does it
 have immediate relevance to your daily life?

                                                                      15
Monday                                                        July 8
FORGIVENESS (John 3:18).

  What important result of the cross did Jesus uphold to Nicodemus?
John 3:18.


   Freedom from condemnation implies forgiveness. Because Jesus
died for all human sin, He is justly able to forgive those who accept
His sacrifice and seek forgiveness. "There is therefore now no con-
demnation for those who are in Christ Jesus" (Rom. 8:1, RSV). Paul
proceeds to explain what it means to be "in Christ Jesus." It means to
be set free by the Holy Spirit from "the law of sin and death" (verse 2).
It means that "the just requirement of the law" is "fulfilled in us, who
walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit" (verse 4).
Forgiveness, resulting in freedom from condemnation, involves much
more than the elimination of guilt incurred by past sins.

   What definition of forgiveness would you deduce from the fol-
lowing passages? Luke 1:77; 4:18; Eph. 1:7; Col. 1:13, 14.


    The Greek word for forgiveness (aphesis) used in each of these
passages means more than a heavenly declaration of pardon. The
word means "release from captivity" (William F. Arndt and F. Wilbur
Gingrich, A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament). In Luke
4:18 the "deliverance" of the captives is forgiveness (aphesin). The
last phrase of the verse translates literally: "to send forth the crushed
in forgiveness (deliverance)." Divine forgiveness includes deliver-
ance from the dominion of sin. In the New Testament, forgiveness is
salvation, redemption, purification from sin. "God's forgiveness is
not merely a judicial act by which He sets us free from condemnation.
It is not only forgiveness for sin, but reclaiming from sin. It is the
outflow of redeeming love that transforms the heart."—Thoughts From
the Mount of Blessing, p. 114.
    "To be pardoned in the way that Christ pardons, is not only to be
forgiven, but to be renewed in the spirit of our mind."—Review and
Herald, Aug. 19, 1890.
    Forgiveness includes (1) Christ's taking away our guilt by virtue of
the fact that He bore it on the cross; (2) Christ's transforming our
hearts by the Holy Spirit. God's love is unconditional; He loves both
sinners and saints and works for the salvation of all. But forgiveness is
never unconditional. Forgiveness is granted on condition that we
accept Christ's sacrifice on the cross and ask for pardon of our sins.
(See John 3:18; 1 John 1:9.)

RIGHTEOUSNESS AND LIFE IMPUTED TO THE BELIEVER
(John 3:14, 15).

   What is the significance of the illustration Jesus used in John
3:14? Num. 21:4-9.


   As the Israelites were traveling toward the Promised Land, they
were attacked by venomous snakes. Many people died, and many
more were dying. God commanded Moses to make a snake of bronze
and place it on a pole. Whoever looked to the snake was healed, not
because there was any virtue in the snake, but because looking to it
demonstrated faith in God and in the Messiah, who was to suffer for
sin. The snake was a symbol of the sin borne by Christ (1 Peter 2:24).
   Life and healing were counted, reckoned, and imputed to those who
looked to the uplifted serpent. Life and healing came from God in
response to the faith of those who looked. They were healed and
reconciled to God by virtue of the merits of Christ, the coming Sav-
iour.
   "When we trust God fully, when we rely upon the merits of Jesus
as a sin-pardoning Saviour, we shall receive all the help that we can
desire. Let none look to self, as though they had power to save
themselves. Jesus died for us because we were helpless to do this. In
Him is our hope, our justification, our righteousness. When we see our
sinfulness, we should not despond, and fear that we have no Saviour,
or that He has no thoughts of mercy toward us. At this very time He is
inviting us to come to Him in our helplessness, and be saved."
—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 431.

    What relationship is there between the story of the bronze
serpent and Paul's message in Romans, chapter 4?


   1. Life from God was imputed to the dying Israelites who looked.
Life from God (the merits of Christ's righteousness) is imputed to us
when we believe (Rom. 4:3-8, 22-25).
   2. Life from God had a tangible effect on the Israelites who looked;
they were physically and spiritually healed. The imputation of Christ's
righteousness to the one who believes is a spiritually transforming
experience, not only a legal accounting. This imputation is identified
as forgiveness (Rom. 4:7). As we have seen, forgiveness includes
transformation.
   "Through faith in His name He imputes unto us His righteousness,
and it becomes a living principle in our life."—That I May Know Him,
p. 302.

                                                                   17

RIGHTEOUSNESS BESTOWED (John 3:3-8).

  In what terms did Jesus explain the transforming work of the
Holy Spirit in the life of the believer? John 3:3-8.


   As birth is the beginning of life, so rebirth is the beginning of a new
life with Christ. Jesus shattered the Pharisee's illusion of personal
holiness. Nicodemus needed heart transformation. He needed new life
from Christ.
   "When the Spirit of God takes possession of the heart, it transforms
the life. Sinful thoughts are put away, evil deeds are renounced; love,
humility, and peace take the place of anger, envy, and strife. Joy takes
the place of sadness, and the countenance reflects the light of heaven.
No one sees the hand that lifts the burden, or beholds the light descend
from the courts above. The blessing comes when by faith the soul
surrenders itself to God. Then that power which no human eye can see
creates a new being in the image of God."—The Desire of Ages,
p. 173.

  What special gift is bestowed upon the believer by the Holy
Spirit? Rom. 3:22-24; 8:9, 10; 10:6-10; Gal. 3:6, 14.


    The gift of the "righteousness of God" upon the believer (Rom.
3:22) is the gift of "grace" (verse 24). Grace is God's loving favor
bestowed upon the unworthy. But it is more. Paul speaks of the "grace
of God which was given you in Christ Jesus" (1 Cor. 1:4, RSV) as the
source of enrichment in "all speech and all knowledge" (verse 5). The
result of receiving God's grace is that "you are not lacking in any
spiritual gift, as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ"
(verse 7). Both the individual and the church are enriched by grace.
    This gift, righteousness (grace), is bestowed upon the heart of the
believer by the Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:9, 10). Romans 10:10 translates
literally: "For with the heart one believes unto righteousness." As
Abraham believed and received the gift of righteousness (Gal. 3:6), so
we' receive the same gift today by the bestowal of the Holy Spirit. We
receive "the blessing of Abraham" (righteousness), "the promise of
the Spirit through faith" (Gal. 3:14, RSV).
    "In order to meet the requirements of the law, our faith must grasp
the righteousness of Christ, accepting it as our righteousness. Through
union with Christ, through acceptance of His righteousness by faith,
we may be qualified to work the works of God, to be colaborers with
Christ."—Selected Messages, book 1, p. 374.

WORKS OF FAITH (John 3:20, 21).

   Jesus concluded His interview with Nicodemus by contrasting the
evil deeds of those who refuse to come to Him with the good deeds of
those who accept Him as Saviour and Lord. "For every one who does
evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds
should be exposed. But he who does what is true comes to the light,
that it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been wrought in God"
(John 3:20, 21, RSV). "Wrought in God" means that the good works
of Christian believers are performed only through the power of Christ.
Those whose sins are forgiven and who are experiencing the gift of
Christ's righteousness have the power of the Holy Spirit to do works
that are acceptable in the sight of God.

   Note the contrast in the New Testament Epistles between "works
of law" and "works of faith":

Rom. 3:20

James 1:22-25

James 2:14-26

   Paul doesn't oppose works of obedience to God's law, and James
doesn't oppose the truth of righteousness by faith alone. When Paul
speaks of "deeds of the law" (Rom 3:20, KJV) or "works of law"
(Rom. 3:20, RSV), he is referring to works performed apart from God
to earn His favor. James speaks of works that result from faith, works
that have been "done through God" (John 3:21, NIV).
   Like James, Paul praises works of faith (Rom. 2:13; 3:31; 8:4).
Like Paul, James believes in righteousness and salvation by faith
(grace) alone. James's point is not that we earn righteousness by
works but that living faith always results in works of obedience to
God's will. "So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead" (James 2:17,
RSV). Abraham was indeed justified by faith (grace) alone (Rom.
3:21-30; Gal. 2:16), but his faith led him to obedience to God's law
(Rom. 3:31; compare Gen. 26:5). James says: "Was not Abraham our
father justified by works, when he offered his son Isaac upon the
altar?" (James 2:21, RSV). James is not contradicting Paul. Abraham's
faith, which alone resulted in God's gift of righteousness to him, was
living faith because He was willing to obey God's commands. His
works demonstrated the faith by which he was justified.

   When do our works cease to be works of faith and become
 works of law? How can we solve the problem?

                                                                      19
Friday                                                     July 12
FURTHER STUDY: Compare Jesus' message to Nicodemus (John
3:1-21) with Paul's teaching regarding righteousness by faith (Ro-
mans 3; Galatians 3; Titus 3:5-7). Read "A Truth Bearing the Divine
Credentials" and "Christ the Way of Life," Selected Messages, book
1, pp. 359-368.

   "Genuine faith appropriates the righteousness of Christ, and the
sinner is made an overcomer with Christ; for he is made a partaker of
the divine nature, and thus divinity and humanity are combined."
—Selected Messages, book 1, pp. 363, 364.

   "In ourselves we are sinners; but in Christ we are righteous. Having
made us righteous through the imputed righteousness of Christ, God
pronounces us just, and treats us as just. He looks upon us as His dear
children. Christ works against the power of sin, and where sin abounded,
grace much more abounds. 'Therefore being justified by faith, we
have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.' "—Selected
Messages, book 1, p. 394.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. A work associate who is not a believer asks you to explain
     how you are saved. What would you say?

   2. A friend shows you a commentary he is reading that pre-
      sents Paul's doctrine of righteousness by faith as different
      from the teachings of Jesus. How would you establish that
      Jesus and Paul taught the same truth using different lan-
      guage and imagery?

   3. A youth in your church shares with you that, despite all his
      efforts, he finds it impossible to overcome certain sins in his
      life. How would you help him?

SUMMARY: Jesus presented Nicodemus with five points on right-
eousness and salvation by faith: (1) the cross makes salvation pos-
sible; (2) God forgives the sins of those who accept Jesus and seek
pardon; (3) the righteousness of Christ is counted, or reckoned, to
those who believe in Christ; (4) the righteousness of Christ is be-
stowed upon believers by the Holy Spirit; (5) works acceptable to God
are the result of faith in Christ and are empowered by the Holy Spirit.

                               ADRA is Our Mother
                                   James H. Zachary

           "ADRA saved us during the famine. During the malaria plague,
        the people of ADRA came to rescue us. Now ADRA is teaching
        us how to make a better life for our families and community."
        Farmers in the Abonsa township of Ethiopia call ADRA their
        mother, for a mother nurtures, teaches, then sets her child free to
        become independent.
            Samuel Bekalo, ADRA regional director, is the key to ADRA's
        success in Abonsa. How does Samuel help people make a better
        life for themselves without making them dependent on ADRA?
            Health Services—He has immunized more than 5,000 persons
        and developed 10 health centers, each with a midwife and a health
        educator, and each with a supply of basic medicines that are sold
        to patients. The money charged pays for restocking the clinic.
            Grain Mills—Before Bekalo began his work, women had to
        walk many kilometers to have their grain ground into flour. Eight
        local grain mills are now operating, and two more are planned.
        Each mill serves 40 to 50 families. The mills provide work for
        some village men. The profits from the mills support schools that
        have been built near the mills.
            Cottage Industries—Little income-producing work was avail-
        able for women in the area. ADRA provided cash loans to 108
         women to start small businesses in their homes. As these women
         repay their loans, other women benefit from the revolving fund.
            Bio-Intensive Gardening—Lack of water, insect pests, costly
         fertilizer, and lack of good seed made farming a challenge in
         Ethiopia. Bekalo is teaching families how to farm using inexpen-
         sive bio-intensive methods. A plot of land only 6 by 16 meters,
         farmed in this manner, can feed an average family for a year.
         Rotating crops, using botanical pest control, deep cultivation to
         conserve water, and developing fertilizers in compost heaps have
                                 transformed the community. Bekalo also
                                 teaches farmers to harvest seeds locally,
                                 eliminating the need to buy expensive seed
                                 or rely on subsidies.
                                     Thanks ADRA—The people of Abonsa
                                  are grateful, "ADRA is a good friend. ADRA
                                  is our mother."

  MEMORY TEXT: "And let them make me a sanctuary; that I
  may dwell among them" (Exodus 25:8).

    KEY THOUGHT: The ancient Israelite sanctuary and its services
illustrate Christ's sacrificial death, ministry of forgiveness, and minis-
try of judgment. His death and ministry of forgiveness make our
salvation possible.

   THE EARTHLY SANCTUARY WAS GOOD NEWS. Today
we look back to the life, ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus
Christ as the greatest good news this world has ever received. Because
of Calvary and Jesus' ministry as our High Priest, all our sins can be
forgiven and our lives transformed.
   Because God's people in ancient times were living before the time
of Christ, they did not have the historical reality that we have of
redemption accomplished at the cross. Yet their sins could be forgiven
and their lives changed by virtue of what the Messiah would do in the
future. God had Moses build an earthly sanctuary and institute its
services as a constant reminder to His people that, because the Mes-
siah was coming to suffer the penalty for all human sin, He could
forgive all their sins and qualify them for eternal life.
   In this lesson we will focus on the sacrifice and the ministry of
forgiveness taught by the earthly sanctuary services.

THE ANCIENT ISRAELITE SANCTUARY (Exod. 26:30).

  What two items of furniture were contained in the court of the
sanctuary, and what was their significance? Exod. 27:1-8 (com-
pare Lev. 4:27-31); Exod. 30:17-21.


   The altar of burnt offering was an outdoor fireplace or grill on
which the remains of animals were burned after being offered as
sacrifices. All animal sacrifices were offered near this altar in the
court of the sanctuary. Every morning and evening, burnt offerings
were offered on the altar of burnt offering (Lev. 6:8-13). Israelite
males offered sin-offerings for themselves and their families at the
altar of burnt offering at least three times a year (Exod. 23:17; Deut.
16:16, 17).
   The laver was a large washbasin at which the priests washed their
hands and feet before entering the Holy Place. Physical washing at the
laver illustrated the higher spiritual cleansing necessary for one who
was about to enter into the presence of God. (See Psalm 51:1, 2.)

  Briefly describe the two rooms of the sanctuary. What was the
purpose of the three items of furniture in the Holy Place? Exod.
26:31-35; 25:23-32; 30:1-8.


   The tabernacle (later Solomon's temple) consisted of two rooms,
the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place. The Holy Place was exactly
twice the size of the Most Holy Place. The Holy Place contained a
seven-branched candlestick (menorah), a table on which twelve loaves
of bread were placed each Sabbath (Lev. 24:5-9), and an altar of
incense. The seven lamps were trimmed morning and evening so that
the light never went out (Exod. 27:20, 21). Israel's light for the world,
which originated in God, was never to be extinguished. The bread on
the table was not food for God; it was food from God, representing
both His physical and spiritual provision for His people. Morning and
evening at the altar of incense a priest offered incense (Exod. 30:7, 8).
The smoke of the incense ascended over the top of the veil separating
the two apartments, entering the very presence of God in the Most
Holy Place. The incense represented the daily prayers of God's people
(Ps. 141:2).
   Before looking at the New Testament, what gospel parallels to the
ancient sanctuary can you immediately detect? The three parts of the
sanctuary (the court, the Holy Place, and the Most Holy Place) sym-
bolize the three phases of Christ's ministry: sacrifice, mediation, and
judgment. The sanctuary provided a preview of the gospel.

                                                                     23

THE MEANING OF THE SANCTUARY SACRIFICES (Heb. 10:
1-12).

   Whose sacrifice was represented by every animal sacrifice of-
fered in the court of the earthly sanctuary? John 1:29; Heb. 7:27.


    The sin offering for the regular Israelite citizen was a female goat
or a female lamb (Lev. 4:27, 28, 32). When John the Baptist hailed
Jesus as "the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world"
(NIV), he was pointing to the deep spiritual meaning of the sanctuary
sacrifices. The same imagery is used elsewhere in the New Testament,
most often in the book of Revelation. (Compare Acts 8:32; 1 Peter
1:19; Rev. 5:6.)
    The Epistle to the Hebrews consistently treats the earthly sanctuary
sacrifices as types or representations of Christ's once-for-all sacrifice.
"He has no need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices daily, first
for his own sins and then for those of the people; he did this once for
all when he offered up himself' (Heb. 7:27, RSV; compare Heb. 8:3;
9:12-14, 22, 28).

   According to Hebrews 10:1-12, what sanctuary sacrifices pointed
forward to and typified the sacrifice of Christ?


   The entire passage (Heb. 10:1-12) is referring to the sacrificial,
ceremonial aspects of the law, which met their fulfillment at Christ's
death. In Hebrews 10:1 the word law cannot refer to the Ten Com-
mandments. They remain the standard of righteousness for Christians
(Rom. 3:31; 7:7, 12, 14; 8:3, 4). "Year by year" translates the Greek
phrase Kat'eniauton, which does not refer only to the yearly sacri-
fices. (The same phrase is used in Hebrews 9:25; 10:3.) The sacrifices
that were offered "year after year" (Heb. 10:1, RSV) included "burnt
offerings and sin offerings" (verse 6), which were offered daily. Verse
11 also refers to the sacrifices offered "year after year": "And every
priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacri-
fices, which can never take away sins" (RSV).
   From God's perspective, animal sacrifices lost their significance at
the death of Christ; it was never God's intention that sin should be
expiated by the blood of animals (Heb. 10:1-4). Daily burnt offerings
and sin offerings foreshadowed the one true sacrifice for sin, that of
Jesus Christ our Lord (Heb. 10:5-12). Christ offered "for all time a
single sacrifice for sins" (verse 12, RSV).
   All sanctuary sacrifices, whether offered daily or annually, pointed
forward to the sacrifice of Christ on the cross.

ATONEMENT FOR SIN (Lev. 4:1-35).

   What two different processes were followed by the priests in
the ancient sanctuary as they provided "atonement" for sin?
(1) Lev. 4:5-7, 16-18, 20; (2) Lev. 4:25, 26, 30, 31; 6:24-30.


   In the case of sin offerings for a priest and for the whole congrega-
tion, the blood of the sacrifices was sprinkled in the Holy Place,
before the veil and on the horns of the altar of incense. In the case of
the sin offerings for a ruler and a common person, the blood of the
sacrifice was sprinkled on the horns of the altar of burnt offering in
the court, and some of the flesh was cooked and eaten in the court of
the sanctuary.
   The two services symbolized the same spiritual truth; namely, that
the sins of repentant sinners were transferred via the priest to the
sanctuary. (See Exod. 28:38; Lev. 10:16-18; Num. 18:1, 23.) In both
services, the officiating priest carried the iniquity of the penitent
sinner into the Holy Place. In the one case, the priest sprinkled the
blood of the sacrifice in the Holy Place. In the other case, the priest ate
some of the flesh and later ministered in the Holy Place. Thus, figura-
tively, the iniquity was transferred through the priest to the sanctuary.
The sanctuary was cleansed on the Day of Atonement (Lev. 16:33).

   What three main acts resulted in "atonement" for sinners who
brought their sacrifices to the earthly sanctuary? Lev. 4:29, 30,
31.


   "And he [the repenting sinner] shall lay his hand on the head of the
sin offering, and kill the sin offering in the place of burnt offering"
(Lev. 4:29, RSV). Confession and sacrifice preceded forgiveness.
Then the priest sprinkled some of the blood of the sacrifice in the
Holy Place or on the horns of the altar of burnt offering (Lev. 4:17,
18, 30). In the latter case, the priest ate some of the flesh of the
sacrifice (Lev. 6:26). "And the priest shall make atonement for him,
and he shall be forgiven" (Lev. 4:31, RSV). "Atonement," which
made forgiveness a reality, was preceded by confession and included
sacrifice and priestly mediation (sprinkling of blood). There was no
forgiveness unless these three acts were performed. The offering of
the animal sacrifice was not the only event that provided "atonement."
"Atonement" was provided by sacrifice and the priest's sprinkling of
blood. Thus the Old Testament establishes clearly that "atonement" is
more than sacrifice: What Christ accomplishes after the cross is also
important to our salvation.

                                                                       25

CHRIST'S MINISTRY OF FORGIVENESS (Heb. 9:11-14).

   On the basis of what three acts can our sins be forgiven today?
(1) 1 John 1:9; (2) 1 Peter 2:24; (3) 1 John 2:1; Heb. 8:11-14;
1 Tim. 2:5.


    For God to forgive our sins today, the same three steps are neces-
sary as those followed in the ancient sanctuary: (1) We confess our
sins; (2) Christ sacrificed Himself for us; (3) our heavenly High Priest
mediates for us, and we are forgiven.
    There is no forgiveness without confession. "Those who humble
their hearts and confess their sins will be pardoned."—Testimonies,
vol. 9, p. 266. "There needs to be a continual reaching out of the heart
after God, a constant, earnest confession of sin and humbling of the
soul before Him."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 455. Our sins were
not forgiven at the cross; we were not there. Our sins are forgiven
today when we confess them by virtue of Christ's provision on the
cross.
    Christ's sacrifice was perfect for all, for all time. The sacrificial
aspect of the "atonement" was provided once for all at the cross (Heb.
7:27; 9:28; 10:12). But, in the Old Testament sense, "atonement" is
not complete until our heavenly Mediator has applied the merits of
His blood on our behalf. As the priest's sprinkling of blood was
necessary in the earthly sanctuary, so Christ's heavenly mediation by
virtue of His shed blood is essential for our sins to be forgiven.
    "The intercession of Christ in man's behalf in the sanctuary above
is as essential to the plan of salvation as was His death upon the cross.
By His death He began that work which after His resurrection He
ascended to complete in heaven. We must by faith enter within the
veil, 'whither the forerunner is for us entered.' Hebrews 6:20. . . .
Jesus has opened the way to the Father's throne, and through His
mediation the sincere desire of all who come to Him in faith may be
presented before God."—The Great Controversy, p. 489.

   What are the counterparts in the Christian era of (1) the
shewbread, (2) the seven-branched candlestick, and (3) the altar
of incense? (1) John 6:32-40, 48-51, 63; (2) John 8:12; Matt. 5:14;
Rev. 1:20; (3) Rev. 8:2-4.


    Christ the bread of life, Christ the light of the world, Christ
 our heavenly high priest and mediator, is the source of our
 spiritual life, light, and salvation.

CHRIST'S MINISTRY IN THE SANCTUARY (1 Cor. 10:3, 4).

  Where was Christ in the ancient Israelite sanctuary? 1 Cor.
10:3, 4; Exod. 25:21, 22.


   First Corinthians 10:4 may be translated: "They drank from the
spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ" (NIV).
Christ accompanied the Israelites in their wilderness sojourn. He was
present in the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night.
When the cloud stopped, they stopped and erected the tabernacle.
Then the cloud descended upon the tabernacle, and Christ's presence
was manifested above the mercy seat in the Most Holy Place. "For
throughout all their journeys the cloud of the Lord was upon the
tabernacle by day, and fire was in it by night, in the sight of all the
house of Israel" (Exod. 40:38, RSV).
   "Christ was their instructor. As He had been with them in the
wilderness, so He was still to be their teacher and guide. In the
tabernacle and the temple His glory dwelt in the holy shekinah above
the mercy seat. In their behalf He constantly manifested the riches of
His love and patience."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 288.
   Christ was represented by every priest who ministered in the court
and the Holy Place during the daily service (Heb. 10:11, 12). But all
throughout the day-by-day services conducted in the court and the
Holy Place, Christ Himself was present in the glory above the mercy
seat in the Most Holy Place. He was present in the Most Holy Place
while His ministry was only in the Holy Place. His Most Holy Place
ministry, represented by the work of the earthly high priest, did not
take place until the Day of Atonement.

  Where did Christ go when He ascended to heaven after His
death and resurrection? Mark 16:19; Eph. 1:20; Heb. 8:1; 12:2.


   "We have such a high priest, one who is seated at the right hand of
the throne of the Majesty in heaven, a minister in the sanctuary and the
true tent which is set up not by man but by the Lord" (Heb. 8:1, 2,
RSV). The only throne in the wilderness tabernacle and in Solomon's
temple was in the Most Holy Place, where Christ dwelt continually.
As Christ's ministry was only Holy Place ministry until the Day of
Atonement, so His heavenly ministry was only Holy Place ministry
until the antitypical Day of Atonement, which began in 1844. Just as
Christ was present in the Most Holy Place during the daily service in
the ancient tabernacle, so He occupies the throne with His Father
during His Holy Place ministry prior to 1844.

                                                                     27

FURTHER STUDY: In relation to the subject of this lesson, study
Hebrews 9:1-14. Read "What Is the Sanctuary?" in The Great Contro-
versy, pp. 409-422.

   Hebrews 9:12 says that "he entered in once into the holy place"
(KJV). The RSV also translates the Greek by "Holy Place." The NIV
translates the same Greek by "the Most Holy Place." The Greek reads
to hagia (accusative, plural, neuter of hagios, meaning "holy" or
"what is holy"). In the Septuagint (the Greek Old Testament), when
some form of hagios is used in reference to the sanctuary, it usually
refers to the sanctuary as a whole. Hebrews 9:12 is correctly trans-
lated: "He entered once into the holy places," or "He entered once into
the sanctuary." It cannot be proved from Hebrews 9 that Christ en-
tered only one apartment of the heavenly sanctuary at His ascension,
nor can it be proved that His antitypical Day of Atonement ministry
began at that time.
   Hebrews 9:1-7 describes the ministries in the two apartments of the
earthly sanctuary. Verse 8 begins, "By this the Holy Spirit indicates"
(RSV). The antecedent of "this" is all that has gone before. The
purpose of the ministries in the two apartments of the earthly sanctu-
ary was to point to the ministries of Christ in the two apartments of the
heavenly sanctuary. The way into the heavenly sanctuary was not
opened as long as the earthly sanctuary ("first tabernacle") still had
significance (verse 8). This earthly sanctuary, "which is symbolic for
the present age" (verse 9, RSV), lost its significance when "Christ
appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come" (verse 11,
RSV). Christ entered "the greater and more perfect tent," the heavenly
sanctuary, to be our mediator and purifier (Heb. 9:11-14).

SUMMARY: The heavenly sanctuary is the original, from which the
earthly sanctuary was a miniature copy. The vast and glorious heav-
enly sanctuary is the dwelling place of the Trinity and is the great
control center of the universe. It is the place where Christ, as High
Priest, conducts His ministry of forgiveness.

                    Divine Appointment
                          Beverly Moody

   "Do you know where I might deliver a letter addressed to
`Mailing Band, Aleknagik, Alaska?'" the postmaster asked one
day. I replied that our church had once had an active mailing band
many years earlier, so he handed me the letter.
    That letter was the beginning of an amazing story that unfolded
in the months to come.
    Tim Lims is from Ghana. While standing in a line in Istanbul,
Turkey, waiting to get a visa for Greece, he noticed the man in
front of him reading a book whose title intrigued him: Bible Readings
for the Home. Tim asked the man about the book, and the man
showed it to him. As Tim thumbed through the book he noticed a
stamp in the back that read, "Mailing Band, Aleknagik, Alaska."
    The book's owner suggested that Tim could write to that ad-
dress to request other books if he was interested. He then named
several Adventist classics, such as the Conflict series. So now
Tim was asking for books.
    Campmeeting had just ended, and I had purchased a paperback
set of the Conflict series, though at the time I did not know why. I
wrapped them and mailed them to Tim in Athens, along with the
address of the mission office there in case he had questions.
    Soon I received a letter telling that Tim was studying the books
with the mission president! Letters crisscrossed the ocean, and we
learned that Tim was the son of a heathen and the grandson of a
fetish priest. But Tim gave his life to Jesus.
    Becoming an Adventist cost Tim his job in Athens, since he
refused to work on Sabbath. But this loss gave him more time to
study the Bible with those who would listen. This grandson of a
 fetish priest hopes to become a Gospel minister. And one of his
 Bible students later visited Pacific Union College, where he met a
 former member of the Alaskan mailing band!
    Only 1,000 copies of Bible Readings were sent out with the
                        "Mailing Band, Aleknagik, Alaska" stamp
                        in the back. Surely God guided that book to
                        the divine appointment in a waiting line thou-
                        sands of miles from its origin.

                          (Left) Tim Lims testifies wherever he can
                       of how Jesus saved him. Beverly Moody is a
                       member of the Aleknagik, Alaska Church.

             Christ Our Judge
              and Advocate




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Leviticus 16; Dan. 7:9-14;
8:14; 9:24-27; Rev. 3:5; 6:9-11.

   MEMORY TEXT: "Fear God, and give glory to him; for the
   hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made
   heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters"
   (Rev. 14:7).

   KEY THOUGHT: The purpose of the pre-advent judgment is that
the heavenly court might verify who among the dead and who among
the living are worthy of eternal life because they have willingly
received the free gift of Christ's righteousness.

   THE DAY OF ATONEMENT SYMBOLIZED THE PRE-
ADVENT JUDGMENT. The Day of Atonement was a judgment day.
It put a seal upon the forgiveness provided throughout the previous
year. It also resulted in God's rejection of individuals who had refused
to confess their sins.
   Since the people's sins had already been forgiven, why was the
Day of Atonement judgment necessary? This judgment was God's
way of demonstrating that He finally rejects professed believers who
refuse to maintain a relationship with Him. He finally provides a seal
of approval for those who, by His grace, have forsaken sin and main-
tained their heart union with Him.
   God mercifully gave one final day on which the individual whose
heart was not right could come into a covenant relationship with Him.
On this day, sinners were given opportunity to be forgiven and to enter
into a new and victorious heart union with their Lord.

THE DAY OF ATONEMENT MINISTRY (Leviticus 16).

  What were the main events of the Day of Atonement? Lev.
16:6-10, 15-22.


   Two goats were taken by the high priest on the Day of Atonement.
One represented Christ, and the other represented Satan. The one that
represented Christ was slain, symbolizing Christ's death on the cross.
"Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins" (Heb.
9:22, RSV). The high priest sprinkled some of the animal's blood on
the mercy seat and before the mercy seat in the Most Holy Place. He
also sprinkled the blood in the Holy Place and on the altar of burnt
offering in the court (Lev. 16:16, 18, 19, 33). Thus every part of the
sanctuary was symbolically cleansed of the record of pardoned sin.
   The sins of the people who had brought their sin offerings during
the year had been forgiven (Lev. 4:26, 31, 35). By the sprinkling of
blood in the daily service, the pardoned record had been symbolically
retained in the sanctuary. Because this record defiled the sanctuary, it
was necessary to cleanse it on the Day of Atonement.

   What was the purpose of the high priest's ministry in the Most
Holy Place of the sanctuary on the Day of Atonement? Lev. 16:30,
33.


   While the high priest was sprinkling the blood before God in the
Most Holy Place, the people were out in the court examining their
hearts to be sure that all their sins had been confessed and put away.
This was a time of self-examination. They were to "afflict" them-
selves (Lev. 16:29, RSV; compare Lev. 23:29). While a ministry was
going on in the sanctuary, a divine work was taking place in the hearts
of the people in the court.
   The Day of Atonement was an annual judgment day, on which both
the sanctuary and the people were cleansed. "For on this day shall
atonement be made for you, to cleanse you; from all your sins you
shall be clean before the Lord" (Lev. 16:30, RSV). In lesson 3, we
discovered that atonement provided forgiveness (Lev. 4:31). In Leviticus
16:30, atonement is said to provide cleansing. Verse 33 explains that,
on the Day of Atonement, atonement (cleansing) was provided for
each part of the sanctuary and "for the priests and for all the people of
the assembly" (RSV). Those whose sins were not previously forgiven
needed • cleansing, and those whose sins were previously forgiven
needed further cleansing. This was a day of spiritual revival.


                                                                     31

THE ANTITYPICAL DAY OF ATONEMENT (Dan. 8:14).

   How do we know that the cleansing of the sanctuary spoken of
in Daniel 8:14 is the end-time judgment typified by the Day of
Atonement?


    Daniel 8:14 translates literally from the Hebrew: "For evenings
(and) mornings two thousand and three hundred; then the sanctuary
will be justified (nitsdaq). The Septuagint translators who, before the
time of Christ, translated the Hebrew Bible into Greek, translated the
last phrase: kathapisthesetai ("and the sanctuary shall be cleansed").
"The Standard Jewish Bible for the English-speaking world," Tanakh-
The Holy Scriptures (1985), translates the Hebrew of Daniel 8:14:
"then the sanctuary shall be cleansed."
    Why is the Hebrew verb to justify translated by the verb "to cleanse"?
Because when God justifies, He cleanses. In the Old Testament the
verb to justify (tsadaq) is used synonymously with words meaning "to
cleanse." "Can mortal man be righteous [tsadaq: justified] before
God? Can a man be pure [taher: to be clean, pure] before his Maker?
(Job 4:17, RSV). Taher is the word used in Leviticus 16:30. In the
New Testament, justification is identified with forgiveness (Rom. 4:5-
8), which involves spiritual cleansing (Col. 1:13, 14). Justification
includes the cleansing work of the Holy Spirit (Titus 3:5-7).
      Daniel 8:14 speaks of a place, the sanctuary (qodesh: "what is
holy," "holy [place]"), being justified or cleansed. So does Leviticus
16:2, 16, 17, 33. And the cleansing of the people is inseparable from
the cleansing of the sanctuary. Ever since the cross, Christian be-
lievers have been forgiven (cleansed) as were Israelites in the daily
service (Lev. 4:31). Daniel 8:14 refers to the final atonement before
Jesus comes. As the sanctuary and the people were cleansed on the
literal Day of Atonement, so the heavenly sanctuary (Heb. 8:1, 2) and
God's end-time people are cleansed in the pre-advent judgment.
    The cleansing of the sanctuary (Dan. 8:14) is a work of judg-
ment. Daniel 7 and 8 outline the history of the world up to the pre-
advent judgment. The prophecies are parallel:

       Daniel 7                             Daniel 8
V. 5, Bear = Medo-Persia             V. 3, Ram = Medo-Persia
V. 6, Leopard = Greece               V. 5, He-goat = Greece
V. 7, Beast = Roman Empire           V. 9, Little horn = Roman Empire
V. 8, Little horn = Papacy           Vs. 9-12, Little horn = Papacy

THE PRE-ADVENT JUDGMENT SCENE (Dan. 7:9-14).

  What scene was Daniel shown after the vision of the little-horn
power? Dan. 7:8-10, 21, 22, 25, 26.


  What kind of session did Daniel say would be conducted in
heaven? How many angels would be present? Dan. 7:10.


   Who was presented before God the Father as the advocate or
attorney in this judgment? What was given to Him in this judg-
ment session? Dan. 7:13, 14.


    The period of papal ecclesiastical supremacy (Dan. 7:25) occupied
the period A.D. 538 to 1798. Shortly after 1798 the heavenly pre-
advent judgment began. What is the nature of this judgment? What
kinds of decisions does it make?
    1. Verse 9—This judgment is in heaven; God's throne is in heaven.
    2. Verse 10—The judgment involves a court session in which
books of record are examined or investigated. The Bible teaches that
God has records of every human life. The book of life contains the
names of those who have at any time accepted Christ (Luke 10:20;
Phil. 4:3; Heb. 12:23). Sins committed and pardoned are recorded
(Eccl. 12:14; Matt. 12:36, 37; Jer. 2:22; Rev. 22:12). Works of faith
are also recorded (Mal. 3:16, 17).
    3. Verse 13—The "Son of man" is the defense attorney in this
judgment. The title Son of man was Jesus' favorite name for Himself
(Matt. 8:20). The Son of man comes to God the Father in the heavenly
judgment.
    4. Verse 14—The Son of man, Christ, receives His kingdom in this
judgment. He receives the names of those who are His for eternity.
The book of life is edited. The names of born-again Christians are
always placed in the book of life (Heb. 12:23). But in the pre-advent
judgment the decision is made as to whose names can be kept there
and whose names should be taken out. The names of those who have
lost their born-again relationship with Jesus are removed (Rev. 3:5).
The end-time seal of God is placed upon those whose names are
 retained in the book of life (Rev. 7:1-3; 14:1-5).
    5. Verse 22—The pre-advent judgment is not convened merely to
condemn the little-horn power; it also vindicates those who have been
 forgiven and who are living in union with Christ. Daniel 7:22 says that
 in this judgment God gives "justice," or "vindication," to His people.


                                                                    33

THE TIME OF THE JUDGMENT (Dan. 8:14).

   Daniel 7:9-14 and 8:14 refer to the cleansing of the heavenly
sanctuary during the antitypical Day of Atonement. This cleansing of
both sanctuary and people is the pre-advent judgment.

  After what period of time would the cleansing of the heavenly
sanctuary begin? Dan. 8:14. What period was cut off from the
2300 days? Dan. 9:24. When did both the 70 weeks and the 2300
days begin in history? Dan. 9:25. How do you know that the 2300
days must represent years? Dan. 8:17, 19.


   The phrase translated "days" (KJV) means a 24-hour period.
The Hebrew phrase is ereb boqer. It means literally "evening-
morning." Some form of this phrase is used 22 times in the Hebrew
Old Testament. When a 24-hour period is intended, the phrase is
always "evening-morning," never "morning-evening." (See Gen. 1:5,
8, 13, 19, 23, 31.) In Daniel 8:14, 26 the phrase is "evening-morning,"
a 24-hour period. The reference in Daniel 8:14 is not to the morning
and evening sacrifices of the sanctuary, but to 2300 24-hour days that
are used as a prophetic symbol.
   The 2300 literal days of Daniel 8:14 are symbolic of 2300 years.
The prophet was told that the work of the little-horn power would
continue till the end of time (Dan. 8:17, 19, 25, 26). Twenty-three
hundred literal days (about 6 years and 4 months) would not reach to
the end of time.
   The relationship between Daniel 8 and 9 reveals that the 2300
days are years and provides us the beginning date for the period.
The vision of Daniel 9 was given in 538 B.C., 13 years after the vision
of Daniel 8 (551 B.C.). Gabriel told Daniel that "seventy weeks"
(Hebrew: "seventy sevens") were to be "cut off' (Hebrew: bathak)
from the 2300 days. These "seventy sevens" must refer to 490 years,
because they were to reach to the time of the Messiah. Because 490
years cannot be cut off from 2300 literal days, the days must be a
prophetic symbol of 2300 years.
   What was the beginning date for the 2300 years (Dan. 8:14) and
the 490 years (Dan. 9:24). Both periods were to begin with the going
forth of the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem (Dan. 9:25).
Ezra 6:14 indicates that three human decrees enacted God's decree.
The decree of Artaxerxes I was certainly put into operation in 457
B.C. Twenty-three hundred years later, in A.D. 1844, the cleansing of
the heavenly sanctuary, the antitypical Day of Atonement, the pre-
advent judgment, began.

WHY IS THE PRE-ADVENT JUDGMENT IMPORTANT TO YOU?
(Rev. 3:5).

   According to the following passages, what is the spiritual sig-
nificance to us of the pre-advent judgment?

Rev. 3:5

Rev. 6:9-11

Rev. 7:1-3

Rev. 14:5

Rev. 19:7, 8

   The Lord will not remove the names of overcomers from the book
of life (Rev. 3:5). The names of those who do not overcome will be
removed. The book of life is edited in the pre-advent judgment (Dan.
7:10; 12:1). During this time of judgment (1844 to the coming of
Jesus), the Lord is calling us to depend totally upon Him.
   The blood of the martyrs mentioned in Revelation 6:9 is crying out
from the ground to God for vindication. This is precisely the work of
the pre-advent judgment (Dan. 7:22). Revelation 6:11 may be trans-
lated: "And there was given to each of them a white robe, and it was
said to them that they should rest a little longer, until their fellow
servants and their brethren, who are about to be killed as they were,
might be made complete (perfect)." Those who at death were right
with Christ are vindicated in the pre-advent judgment. Their living
brethren are made complete in Christ prior to receiving the end-time
seal of God (Rev. 7:1-3). God's seal is given to those who live in close
union with Christ. The seal is "his name and his Father's name written
on their foreheads" (Rev. 14:1, RSV). Christ's name and the Father's
name are symbols of their character. (See Christ's Object Lessons,
p. 330.) Those who are sealed before the second coming of Jesus will
be spiritually "spotless" (Rev. 14:5, RSV). They will wear the white
robe of Christ's righteousness and will reflect His character in all they
do (Rev. 19:7, 8; compare 1 John 2:29; 3:7).
    "Only the covering which Christ Himself has provided can make us
meet to appear in God's presence. This covering, the robe of His own
righteousness, Christ will put upon every repenting, believing soul.
[Rev. 3:18 quoted]. . . . This robe, woven in the loom of heaven, has in
it not one thread of human devising. Christ in His humanity wrought
out a perfect character, and this character He offers to impart to us."
 —Christ's Object Lessons, p. 311.

                                                                     35

FURTHER STUDY: In connection with the topic of the pre-advent
judgment, study Matthew 22:11-14; Revelation 8:5; 10:8-11:1; 15:5-
8; 19:1-8.

   The pre-advent judgment declares irrevocably saved those who
have been consistently enjoying present salvation in Christ. The pre-
advent judgment eternally vindicates believers whose sins have previ-
ously been forgiven. In this judgment, approval is given to those who,
by constantly receiving the impartation of Christ's righteousness, are
experiencing victory over sin.
   "Everything that we of ourselves can do is defiled by sin. But the
Son of God 'was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no
sin.' Sin is defined to be 'the transgression of the law.' 1 John 3:5, 4.
But Christ was obedient to every requirement of the law. . . . By His
perfect obedience He has made it possible for every human being to
obey God's commandments. When we submit ourselves to Christ, the
heart is united with His heart, the will is merged in His will, the mind
becomes one with His mind, the thoughts are brought into captivity to
Him; we live His life. This is what it means to be clothed with the
garment of His righteousness. Then as the Lord looks upon us He sees,
not the fig-leaf garment, not the nakedness and deformity of sin, but
His own robe or righteousness, which is perfect obedience to the law
of Jehovah."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 311, 312.
   "Christ is waiting with longing desire for the manifestation of
Himself in His church. When the character of Christ shall be perfectly
reproduced in His people, then He will come to claim them as His
own."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 69.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. A friend in your church tells you that the guilt of your sins
     is not blotted out until the pre-advent judgment. What Bible
     answer can you give?

   2. Another friend argues that victory over sin means that
      everything we do is free from all human imperfection. How
      would you reply?

  3. Yet another friend says that, because all our sins were
     forgiven at the cross, there is no need for a pre-advent
     judgment. What answer would you give?

SUMMARY: The pre-advent judgment is the antitypical Day of Atone-
ment, involving the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary of the record
of pardoned sin and the spiritual cleansing of God's people on earth.

                            Many Times a Pastor
                                   Arlene Webb

             Tony Ampo lives on the island of Mindanao, in the Philip-
         pines. Even as a child he was drawn to God. Although his tribe
         were animists, Tony responded to the invitation of Protestant
         missionaries who came to his village when he was just 7 years
         old. Tony was fascinated by the stories and pictures, and went to
         church whenever he could. At the age of 10 he joined the Protes-
         tant church. His parents were so angry they forced Tony to leave
         home. He went to live with his uncle in a village 100 miles away.
         There he could worship God freely. When he was 18, his father
         sent word that his mother was near death. Tony took a minister
         with him to his parents' home. The pastor had a Bible study with
         Tony's parents, then he prayed for Tony's mother to be healed.
         His mother felt better immediately, and as a result the family
         agreed to join the church. Tony's father, an influential village
         leader, gave land for a church. When word spread of the wife's
         healing, the whole community joined the new church.
             After Tony finished high school, he was invited to become a
         pastor. He attended a field training school and was assigned to
         his first church. During the next ten years, Tony raised up ten
         churches, each having from 10 to 30 families.
             One day an Adventist pastor gave Tony a copy of The Great
         Controversy. As he read it, he was convicted of the Sabbath
         truth. Each Sunday he felt guilty knowing that Saturday was the
         real Sabbath, but for two years he kept this knowledge to him-
         self. Finally he shared his conviction with his wife and chal-
          lenged her to study some Bible texts on the Sabbath. A week
          later she agreed to join him in keeping the Sabbath. They knew
          they would lose their pastoral position, but they prayed that the
          Lord would provide for them.
             Tony resigned his pastorate and in 1993, he and his family
          were baptized into the Adventist church. In spite of pleas to
          reconsider, Tony remained steadfast. He became an Adventist
          lay pastor in the same village, sharing his new beliefs wherever
          he could. Soon 65 persons joined the Adventist church.
             He has just finished the ministerial course at Mountain View
          College in the Philippines, and now is a full-time pastor. Pray
          that Tony's zeal will win many more to God's remnant church.

          At the time of writing, Arlene Webb was a school teacher at
         Mountain View College school in South Philippines.

            Christ in the Law




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Exod. 19:16-25; 20:1-17;
Matt. 5:17-19.

  MEMORY TEXT: "If you love me, keep my commandments"
  (John 14:15, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: God's law of Ten Commandments is an ex-
pression of His holy and just character. When we are saved by Christ's
grace and filled with His love, we are willing and able to obey His
law.

   GOD'S LAW OF TEN COMMANDMENTS IS THE STAND-
ARD FOR ALL. Ann Landers once said to a group of college stu-
dents, "If God had not regarded it as important that we obey Him, He
would have given us ten suggestions." Many people treat the Ten
Commandments as a set of laws that do not have relevance to us
today. Some argue that the attempt to obey the Ten Commandments
amounts to legalism. They think the law of love demands that we
sometimes act contrary to the Ten Commandments.
   Some Christians declare that the Ten Commandments were nailed
to the cross. They assert that the Old Testament ten-commandment
law is no longer binding.
   Others believe that their works of obedience to the laws of God and
the policies of the church will somehow improve their standing with
God. They believe that God's grace and our faith are necessary, but
that our works are part of the means by which we are saved.
   Has God always had a law that He has required His created beings
to obey? What is the relationship between the Ten Commandments
and salvation by faith in Jesus Christ?

GOD'S LAW BEFORE SIN (Ps. 119:142).

   The Scriptures speak of God as perfectly righteous (Ps. 97:2; 119:137;
Jer. 23:6). "All unrighteousness is sin" (1 John 5:17). "Sin is lawless-
ness" (1 John 3:4, RSV). Because God is perfectly righteous, there is
no sin or lawlessness in Him. What is lawlessness? There would be no
way to define lawlessness, by contrast with righteousness, if there
were no law by which God chooses to live. Lawfulness is what God is.
Anything else is lawlessness.

   Of what relevance is the fact that God's character has never
changed? Mal. 3:6; Heb. 13:8; James 1:17. Have God's righteous-
ness and His law always existed? Will they always exist in the
future? Ps. 119:142, 152; 111:7, 8.


   God's character has never changed. In the eternal ages before our
world was created, God was always perfectly righteous. He was in
perfect conformity to the law of life, which He had established. His
law defined His way of life and that of the perfect beings He had
created. If God's law could be abolished or changed, the standard of
His character would change. Under those circumstances, He could not
be regarded as unchangeably righteous. God's law is just as immu-
table (unchanging) as His righteous character.
   Lucifer and one-third of the angels sinned against God (2 Peter 2:4;
Rev. 12:4, 7-10). "Where there is no law there is no transgression"
(Rom. 4:15, RSV). Therefore, God's law existed in heaven before our
world was created.

   What additional evidence do we have that God's law existed
before the fall of Adam and Eve? Rom. 5:12; Gal. 3:12; Isa. 43:27.


   If no law exists, there is no such thing as sin (Rom. 4:15). Adam
and Eve were created subject to the law of God. The fact that they
were not given a written law in the Garden of Eden does not imply
that no law existed. Their lives were in perfect conformity to the
principles of life that governed all God's creatures. In their perfect
state before the Fall, they lived by sight, not by faith. Their perfect
union with God made it possible for them to obey and live. They lost
their perfect• fellowship with God and righteous lives when they chose
to break God's law.

    Redemption is the restoration of the image of God in human-
 ity. What does this imply in regard to obedience to God's law?

                                                                      39

THE LAW BETWEEN CREATION AND SINAI (Gen. 26:5).

   In what form did sin exist in the centuries after the Fall? Gen.
4:8; 6:5, 17. Why were Sodom and Gomorrah destroyed? Gen.
18:24, 32; 19:24, 25.


   The world before the Flood had every opportunity to know God's
law. That world was destroyed because people chose to disobey and
live in sin. Likewise, Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed because
the people rejected the moral stipulations of the divine law. To assert
that early humans were so primitive that they could not know the
moral imperatives that exist in modern societies is to accuse God of
injustice in destroying the antediluvian world and the cities of Sodom
and Gomorrah. When Jesus compared the world immediately before
His second coming to the world before the Flood, he offered no
excuse for early humans on the grounds of their ignorance of His
moral law. (See Matt. 24:37-39.)

  How did the Lord preserve knowledge of His standard of right-
eousness prior to Sinai? Gen. 7:1; 26:5.


    The great men and women of faith who lived before the giving of
the written law at Sinai were sinners in need of the Saviour. Noah and
Abraham had lapses from faith. God focused on their spiritual victo-
ries attained by complete dependence upon Him. Not only was Noah a
preacher of righteousness (2 Peter 2:5), he practiced what he preached
by allowing the righteousness of God to be demonstrated in his life.
God could identify him as "righteous" (Gen. 7:1), because, by faith,
he lived by the righteous principles of the divine law. Although
Abraham is presented in Scripture as the great example of life by
faith, he had serious lapses from obedience by faith in God (Gen.
16:1-4; 20:2; Gal. 4:21-31). Even so, God praised and blessed Abraham's
consistent faith and obedience to His law (Gen. 15:6; 26:5).
   "Some few in every generation from Adam resisted his [Satan's]
every artifice and stood forth as noble representatives of what it was
in the power of man to do and to be—Christ working with human
efforts, helping man in overcoming the power of Satan. Enoch and
Elijah are the correct representatives of what the race might be through
faith in Jesus Christ if they chose to be."—Ellen G. White, Review and
Herald, March 3, 1874.

   What answer can you give to those today who assert that faith
 excludes the necessity of obedience?

THE GIVING OF THE LAW AT SINAI (Exod. 19:16-25).

   Before Sinai the sacred principles of God's law were handed down
from one generation of faithful believers to the next. Israel observed
the Sabbath of the fourth commandment before God gave the written
version of His law to Moses. (See Gen. 2:1-3; Exod. 16:4, 5, 23-30.)
The principles they were asked to live by prior to their arrival at Sinai
were the eternal principles of the Ten Commandments.
   As slaves in Egypt the children of Israel had to a considerable
degree forgotten the standard of righteousness that the Lord had given
to humanity at Creation. To dramatize His love for them, and to teach
them the sacredness of His requirements, the Lord proclaimed His law
in their hearing from Mt. Sinai.

  Briefly describe the circumstances under which the law was
proclaimed at Sinai. Exod. 19:16-20; 20:1, 18-21.


   The prophets wrote their inspired messages in their own languages
and literary styles. But the Ten Commandments were spoken and
written by God Himself (Exod. 24:12-14). Unlike the ceremonial
laws, the Ten Commandments have timeless application to the human
situation. God spoke and wrote this law to dramatize the eternal
significance of its principles.

   Where were the tables of stone containing the Ten Command-
ments placed? Exod. 25:16. Why is revival of obedience to this law
so important to end-time humanity? Dan. 8:14; Heb. 9:7; Rev.
11:19.


   The ark of the covenant was made of acacia wood. It was approxi-
mately 4 feet 4 inches long and 2 feet 7 inches wide and high. It was
overlaid with gold within and without. The "testimony," which was
God's law written on tables of stone, was placed inside the ark.
Hence, the ark was called the "ark of the testimony," and the sanctu-
ary was called "the tabernacle of testimony." (See Exod. 38:21.)
   On the Day of Atonement blood was sprinkled on the mercy seat
that covered the ark of the testimony (Lev. 16:15). Because God's
mercy is united with His justice, He is able, by virtue of Christ's
sacrifice, to forgive sin and blot out the record of pardoned sin.
Adventists have identified the antitypical Day of Atonement in the
books of Daniel and Revelation. They have shown from the Bible that
God's law contained in the heavenly "ark of his testament" is the
standard of the final judgment (Rev. 11:19).

                                                                      41

THE TEACHING OF THE TEN COMMANDMENTS (Exod. 20:1-
17).

   On the first table of the Ten Commandments are four laws that
govern our relationship with God. The second table records six laws
that instruct us in our relationships with our fellow human beings.

   Briefly summarize the first four commandments. Exod. 20:3-
11.


   Basic to Bible religion is the simple principle that there is only one
God. (See Deut. 6:4; Mark 12:28, 29.) Jesus did not claim to be
another god; He claimed to be One with the Father and the Holy
Spirit. Our one triune God is Creator and Redeemer. Jesus explained
this mysterious truth as simply as possible: "Anyone who has seen me
has seen the Father. . . . Don't you believe that I am in the Father, and
that the Father is in me?" (John 14:9, 10, NIV).
   The remaining nine commandments emerge logically from the
first. Because we are to revere the one true God, idolatry and blas-
phemy are ruled out. Because we love God, we respond to His appeal
for us to remember the Sabbath day as a memorial of His creative and
redemptive work.

   Briefly summarize the last six commandments. Exod. 20:12-17.


   Showing honor for father and mother is a reflection of our honor
for God, our heavenly Father. Entering into the spirit of the first
commandment enables us to love our earthly parents, unselfishly
forgiving their human weaknesses. If we accept Christ, we are de-
livered from the unholy impulses that result in murder, adultery, theft,
lying, and covetousness. Our fellowship with God, in response to the
full meaning of the first commandment, directs all our relationships.
   "There is not a commandment of the law that is not for the good
and happiness of man, both in this life and in the life to come. In
obedience to God's law, man is surrounded as with a hedge and kept
from the evil. He who breaks down this divinely erected barrier at one
point has destroyed its power to protect him; for he has opened a way
by which the enemy can enter to waste and ruin."—Thoughts From
the Mount of Blessing, p. 52.

   Considering your own Christian experience, when your rela-
tionship with God changes, do changes occur in your relation-
ship with other people? Explain.

CHRIST AND THE TEN COMMANDMENTS (Matt. 5:17-19).

   If God had intended the Ten Commandments to apply only to
Israel before the cross, and not to Christians, we would expect to find
some indication of this in the teachings of Jesus. Christians come to
Jesus for salvation and for direction in how they should live.

  What did Jesus teach about the continuing significance of the
Ten Commandments? Matt. 5:17-19.


    Jesus did not come to abolish the law of God, but to fill it full of
meaning. The word fulfil (Matt. 5:17) translates the Greek word that
means "to make full," "fill," "complete," "bring to an end." Because
the word has a variety of possible meanings, the antinomians (no-law
exponents) have assumed that Jesus was teaching that He came to
bring the law to an end. Thus they would have Matthew 5:17 read: "I
have not come to abolish them but to bring them to an end." The
contradiction is glaring.
    Jesus' subsequent explanation clarifies His meaning. He came to
fill the law full of significance. "Until heaven and earth disappear, not
the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means
disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished" (Matt.
5:18, NIV). A person who breaks a commandment and teaches others
to do so will be rejected by God (verse 19). Why? Because our
righteousness is to surpass the legalistic conformity of the scribes and
Pharisees (verse 20).

   Did Jesus weaken the Ten Commandments by giving them a
spiritual interpretation? Were His interpretations more or less
strict than those given traditionally? Matt. 5:21-30.


   The law that Jesus came to fill with meaning (Matt. 5:17) is the law
He cites in verses 21-28. Sinful anger breaks the sixth commandment.
Lustful thoughts break the seventh commandment. Obeying the spirit
of the law does not involve destroying the letter of the law. Obedience
in spirit goes beyond a mere literalistic attempt to obey the letter.
   When Jesus summarized the two tables of the law as teaching love
to God and love to humanity, He did not imply that love destroys the
law (Matt. 22:37-40). "Love is the fulfilling of the law" (Rom. 13:10)
in the sense that love enables conformity to the true spirit of the law.

    What part does love play in your Sabbath observance?

FURTHER STUDY: Study apostolic teaching regarding the impor-
tance of the Ten Commandments for Christians: Rom. 3:31; 7:7, 12,
14; 8:3, 4; James 2:10-18; 1 John 2:3, 4; 5:2-4; Rev. 12:17; 14:12.

   The law is never presented either in the Old or in the New Testa-
ment as the means of salvation. Salvation is the gift of God's grace to
the person who has faith (Eph. 2:8-10; Rom. 1:16, 17; Hab. 2:4). Such
faith will always result in obedience to God's law. Works of obedi-
ence do not save us or improve our salvation standing with God. But
they demonstrate that true faith is in our hearts and that we are
enjoying the born-again experience. The standard of righteousness is
God's law; the means by which we arrive at the standard is God's
grace given to us freely when we believe. For example, a husband
who enjoys a loving relationship with his wife does not wash the
dishes and help her in other home duties in order to earn her love. He
does these things because he already loves her and knows she loves
him. We do not earn Christ's love when we keep His commandments.
We keep them because we have His love and the gift of His saving
grace. Such obedience is a joy and a privilege. We love to do those
things that please our heavenly Father. (See John 8:29.)

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How would you answer a person who declares that, because
     of our fallen condition, it is impossible for us to obey God's
     law?

   2. Someone suggests to you that the attempt to obey God's law
      is legalism. How would you answer? When are our efforts
      legalism and when are they not?

   3. What is meant by Revelation 12:17?
      — God's end-time people keep some of the commandments
        some of the time.
      — They keep all the commandments some of the time.
      — They keep all the commandments all the time.

SUMMARY: The principles of God's great law of liberty have al-
ways existed and will exist eternally. If the law could have been
changed, Jesus need not have died for sin. The law of God is the
standard of righteousness now as it was before the cross. As salvation
was by faith before the cross, so it is now. The cross made possible
forgiveness for sin, and it made possible obedience to God's unchang-
ing law.

                  Tony Wins His Cousin
                          Arlene Webb


    Paul Aninohon is the cousin of Tony Ampo (see last week's
story). Although Paul and his mother were members of an indig-
enous church in the Philippines, they had not been truly con-
verted, and did not even own a Bible. At age 18 he began Bible
studies with a Protestant group. He gave his heart and life to the
Lord and was baptized. He attended a Bible institute and gradu-
ated with a theology degree. He was assigned as pastor. Two
years later he became an evangelist, and worked in one area for
eight years, conducting crusades and winning hundreds of souls
to his church.
    He met a young Bible worker, and the two married, but two
years later his wife died. Paul became so discouraged that he gave
up his faith in God. He joined an armed group of Communists in
the Philippines. Three years later he surrendered to police and
joined the military. During this time he married again.
    Paul's cousin, Tony Ampo, persuaded Paul to return to the
Lord and rejoin the Protestant church. Paul agreed, and when he
was discharged from the army, he was assigned to pastor a church.
    In the meantime, Tony had discovered the Sabbath truth and
was studying the Adventist doctrines. He again visited Paul, this
time to persuade him to study this new religion. Paul resisted but
Tony continued to pray for Paul. Later Paul found some literature
on the Sabbath from another group, and he joined them. He
resigned from his Protestant church and was assigned to pastor
for the Sabbathkeeping church in the same town.
    After Tony continued to talk to Paul about the Adventist
truths, and after a year of studies, Paul and his family were
convicted of the deeper meaning of the Sabbath and the Adventist
message.
    Paul and three of his daughters joined Tony at a youth con-
 gress held at Mountain View College in 1993, where they were
 baptized. Paul resigned his pastorate and became a lay pastor in
 the same area! In 1993 Paul and Tony studied theology at
 Mountain View College. They graduated in 1995, and now are
 full-time pastors in the Philippines.


  At the time of writing, Arlene Webb was a teacher at Mountain
View College school in South Philippines.

        Christ in the Sabbath




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S LESSON: Exod. 20:8-11; Heb. 4:1-
11.

   MEMORY TEXT: "For in six days the Lord made heaven and
   earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh
   day: wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed
   it" (Exodus 20:11).

   KEY THOUGHT: The Lord gradually unfolded the full meaning
of the Sabbath during the centuries before the cross. It is best under-
stood in the light of Calvary.

   GOD CREATED THE UNIVERSE (Heb. 1:1, 2). Consequently,
there is a "distinction between the Creator and His creatures."—The
Great Controversy, p. 438. This distinction lies at the very heart of the
meaning of the Sabbath. The Sabbath celebrates the difference be-
tween God and humanity, calling upon the creature to rest in the
Creator. (See Mark 2:27.)
   "God saw that a Sabbath was essential for man, even in Paradise.
He needed to lay aside his own interests and pursuits for one day of
the seven, that he might more fully contemplate the works of God, and
meditate upon His power and goodness. He needed a Sabbath, to
remind him more vividly of God, and to awaken gratitude because all
that he enjoyed and possessed came from the beneficent hand of the
Creator."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 48.
   "Had the Sabbath been universally kept, man's thoughts and affec-
tions would have been led to the Creator as the object of reverence
and worship, and there would never have been an idolater, an atheist,
or an infidel."—The Great Controversy, p. 438.

THE SABBATH AS A CREATION ORDINANCE (Gen. 2:1-3).

   How do we know that the Sabbath was instituted for all human-
ity in every age, not only for the Israelite nation? Gen. 2:1-3.


   In his Creation account Moses mentions that, after concluding His
six days of Creation, God rested on the Sabbath (Gen. 2:1-3). The
Lord repeats this fact in the fourth commandment (Exod. 20:8-11).
Gordon J. Wenham states: "The seventh day is the very first thing to
be hallowed in Scripture, to acquire that special status that properly
belongs to God alone. In this way Genesis emphasizes the sacredness
of the Sabbath. Coupled with the threefold reference to God resting
from all his work on that day, these verses give the clearest of hints of
how man created in the divine image should conduct himself on the
seventh day."—Word Biblical Commentary, Gen. 1-15 (Waco, Tex.:
Word Books, 1987), p. 36.

   What is different about the Genesis reference to the seventh
day in Creation and the references to the other six days? Gen. 1:5,
8, 13, 19, 23, 31; 2:2, 3.


   Unlike the other six, the seventh Creation day is not designated by
"evening and morning." Some scholars claim that the six days were
set periods, whereas the seventh was open-ended. Thus, they suggest
the Sabbath was pre-Fall time, to be restored when sin and sinners are
no more. This overlooks three important facts: (1) The seventh day is
called a day (Hebrew yom; Gen. 2:2), as are the previous six days
(Gen. 1:5-31). (2) The last day of Creation week is called the "sev-
enth." (3) The fourth commandment equates the seven as equal parts
of one week (Exod. 20:8-11). Therefore, Creation Sabbath was not an
extended period of time anymore than were the previous six Creation
days.
   The word for day in Hebrew (yom) always means a 24-hour period
when used with the adjectival numerals "first," "second," "third," etc.
Hence, Genesis 1 speaks of Creation in six literal days. The normal
linguistic meaning of "seventh day" in Genesis 2:2 is the same as the
meaning of the previous six days. Unlike the month and the year,
which are marked off respectively by the moon- and sun-rotation
cycles, there is no natural phenomenon to mark off the week. The
week originates from Creation week.

    What is the relevance for the Sabbath doctrine that the weekly
 cycle has never been changed?

                                                                      47

THE SABBATH AT SINAI (Exod. 20:8-11).

  What is the significance of the word remember in the fourth
commandment? Exod. 20:8.


   Remember suggests that the Sabbath must have preceded the writ-
ing of the Ten Commandments on stone at Sinai. Moreover, before
Sinai, God sent a double portion of manna on the sixth day so that
Israel could observe the seventh day as a Sabbath (Exod. 16:4, 5, 22-
30). As a Creation ordinance, the Sabbath had come down from
Paradise. It was observed by Israel in the wilderness during the three
months before Sinai (Exod. 19:1).

   Who wrote the Sabbath law at Sinai? Exod. 20:1, 2.


   "I am the Lord. Literally, 'I am Yahweh,' a name derived from the
verb 'to be,' to become'. . . . It means 'the Existing One,' the One
who causes to be'. . . . When, therefore, Jesus said to the Jews of His
day, 'Before Abraham was, I am' (John 8:58), they understood that
He was claiming to be 'the Lord' of the Old Testament. This explains
their hostility and their attempt to kill Him (John 8:59). It was Jesus
Christ, the second person of the Godhead, who was the 'God' of the
Israelites throughout their history (Exod. 32:34; John 1:1-3, 14; 6:46,
62; 17:5; 1 Cor. 10:4; Col. 1:13-18; Heb. 1:1-3; Rev. 1:17, 18; PP
[Patriarchs and Prophets], p. 366)."—SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 1, p. 601.

  Is the Sabbath rest spiritual or physical? Or is it both? Why?
Exod. 20:11; Gen. 2:2.


    The Sabbath is a time for us to come apart from the cares of the
week and come to the One who cares. "No unnecessary secular labor
is to be performed on that day. It is to be spent in religious reflection,
worship, and service for God. It provides, as well, an opportunity for
physical rest. This feature of the Sabbath is peculiarly important to
man in his sinful state, when he must earn his bread by the sweat of his
face (Gen. 3:17-19)."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, pp. 604, 605.

    What does it mean to us that Christ, who wrote the Sabbath
 law at Sinai, is also the Lord of the Sabbath (Mark 2:28)?

Tuesday                                               August 6
THE EXODUS AND THE SABBATH (Deut. 5:12-15).

   Why did the Lord introduce the Ten Commandments as He
did? Exod. 20:1, 2; Deut. 5:6.


   The one event that overshadows all the history of Israel is the
glorious Exodus deliverance. It was as the God of the Exodus, the One
who miraculously delivered Israel from slavery and certain death at
the hands of the pursuing Egyptian army, that Christ invited His
people to rest in Him. Trapped at the Red Sea, they were helplessly
unable to escape—for the sea before them seemed uncrossable, the
mountain to the side unscalable, and the army behind them unbeat-
able. All Israel could do was to rest in Christ and see His wonderful
salvation. He opened up a way on dry ground for them to cross over,
and He destroyed their enemies, as well. Christ had demonstrated that
resting in Him brings great blessing. The Exodus, therefore, became a
parable for the Sabbath. It illustrates that the Sabbath was made for
people (Mark 2:27)—for our benefit.

   What additional information on the fourth commandment is
recorded in Deuteronomy 5:15?


   Exodus 20 speaks of keeping the Sabbath in remembrance of
Creation. Deuteronomy 5 speaks of keeping the Sabbath in remem-
brance of the Exodus. Is this a contradiction? Or is a deeper perspec-
tive involved? Deuteronomy 5:15 presents a broader meaning of the
Sabbath. The Sabbath celebrates Christ's completed deliverance at the
Red Sea, as well as His completed Creation in Eden. Both completed
works of Christ reveal the distinction between the Creator and His
creatures. In both, Christ was the active agent, and people were the
recipients. In both, Christ gave, and people received the gift. This
opens up the very heart of the Sabbath, which is the very essence of
the gospel—that humanity is called to rest in Christ's gift.
   It is true that the Sabbath was given to Israel to celebrate the
Exodus (Deut. 5:15). But it is also true that the Sabbath preceded
Sinai (Exod. 16:22-30), that it is a Creation ordinance (Gen. 2:1, 2),
and, as such, was "made for man" (Mark 2:27).

    When a non-Christian friend asks you to explain the rel-
 evance the Sabbath has in your life, how do you reply? At what
 point would you begin in giving a Bible study on the Sabbath?
 How would you avoid giving the impression that you are a
 legalist?

                                                                  49

SABBATH AS A SIGN (Ezek. 20:9-12).

  In what way is the Sabbath experience of sanctification compa-
rable to the historical Exodus? Ezek. 20:9-12.


   Again the Exodus is in focus in Ezekiel 20. Israelites were enslaved
to false idols, as well as to the Egyptians. Christ longed to free them
from their spiritual slavery. As the Exodus was a self-revelation of
Christ to the freed slaves (verse 9), so He gave them Sabbaths "so they
would know that I the Lord made them holy" (Ezek. 20:12, NIV). The
word holy indicates a deeper meaning of the Sabbath. Holy in the
Hebrew (qadosh) and the Greek (hagios) means "set apart." In the
Exodus, Christ set His people apart from the Egyptians, with a view to
making them a separate nation. The Exodus therefore typified histori-
cally what Christ desired for His people experientially—separation
from the world to be one with Him. Just as He removed them from
slavery in Egypt to bring them into their own Promised Land, so He
sought to free them from the deeper slavery within, to bring them to
Himself, the Promised Redeemer.
   Christ gave Israel the Sabbath as the sign of their freedom. They
were set apart to be with Christ. Only in relationship with Him could
they be really set apart.

  What does it mean that the Sabbath is a sign of sanctification?
Ezek. 20:12.


   Ezekiel speaks of the re-creative work within that only the Creator
can actualize. As Christ created humanity, so only He re-creates.
Sanctification is God's work, not people's. The Sabbath is a sign of
sanctification, because it focuses on the distinction between the Crea-
tor, who alone makes holy, and the creature who receives His sanctifi-
cation.

  What part do God's people have in this sign of sanctification?
Exod. 31:13, 16, 17.


   "The Sabbath is the sign of obedience. He who from the heart
obeys the fourth commandment will obey the whole law. He is sancti-
fied through obedience."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, p. 350.

    Why do those who truly keep the Sabbath keep the whole
 law? Is this why the Sabbath is a test in the end time?

CHRIST AND THE SABBATH (Luke 4:16).

  What new Exodus did Christ face in His public ministry as the
God-man? Luke 4:18, 19 (compare Isa. 61:1, 2).


   Christ said He came to set the prisoners free. Israelites were in
worse slavery than that experienced under Egyptian taskmasters. Bound
by their traditional chains, they were attempting to work their way to
heaven. Two tractates of the Mishnah (which presents the traditional
laws of the Jews) are given over to Sabbath rules and regulations.

  What was one method Christ used to dramatize the good news
about the Sabbath? Luke 13:11-14; John 5:1-15.


   Christ often healed on the Sabbath to illustrate His desire to set
people free. He linked healing ministry with Sabbath observance. He
attempted to show that "the Sabbath was made for man, and not man
for the Sabbath" (Mark 2:27). The man at the pool of Bethesda had
been a captive there for thirty-eight years (John 5:5). Christ knew that
this man would ever afterward associate the Sabbath with the restora-
tive presence of the Saviour. To be what God intended it to be, the
Sabbath must open up to us how the presence of Christ makes a
radical difference in our lives. If we lack the divine presence in our
lives, the "Sabbath experience" remains incomplete, even if we are
attempting to observe the seventh day.

   Why did Christ die on a Friday? Luke 23:54-24:1.


   Two beginnings for the race took place on Creation and crucifixion
Fridays. These days also marked two ends—the end of Creation week
and of the re-creation sacrifice. The first full day following both
Fridays was a Sabbath celebration. At crucifixion weekend, the Sab-
bath took on additional meaning. Christ's death constituted the great-
est exodus ever. He died so that humanity could go free. Calvary is the
ultimate revelation that there is a radical distinction between the
Creator and the creature. He did for us that which we could never do
for ourselves. Crucifixion Sabbath celebrates ultimate spiritual free-
dom.

   How can we as a church more effectively celebrate on the
 Sabbath this greatest exodus?


                                                                    51
Friday                                                   August 9
FURTHER STUDY: Study the relationship of the following texts to
the Sabbath message: Rev. 1:10; 7:1-3; 9:4; 11:19; 14:7; 15:2; com-
pare Isa. 66:22, 23.

   "It is Satan's constant effort to misrepresent the character of God,
the nature of sin, and the real issues at stake in the great contro-
versy."—The Great Controversy, p. 569.
   "From the opening of the great controversy it has been Satan's
purpose to misrepresent God's character, and to excite rebellion against
His law."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 338.
   Because God's law is a transcript of His character, any attempt to
change the law is tantamount to an attempt to change Him. Therefore,
in heaven, Satan "denounced the divine statutes as a restriction of
their liberty and declared that it was his purpose to secure the aboli-
tion of law; that, freed from this restraint, the hosts of heaven might
enter upon a more exalted, more glorious state of existence."—The
Great Controversy, p. 499.
   In the end time, Satan will use the same strategy that was so
successful in heaven and in Eden. "Through spiritualism, Satan ap-
pears as a benefactor of the race, healing the diseases of the people,
and professing to present a new and more exalted system of religious
faith; but at the same time he works as a destroyer."—The Great
Controversy, p. 589.
   Though the discovery of God's law came to the angels as a surprise
(Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 109), they reverence the
law (Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 349). It is as unchangeable as God
(Spiritual Gifts, vol. 3, p. 46) and His throne (E. G. White Comments,
SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1166). Christ came to earth to exalt
the law (E. G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6,
p. 1097), and on the cross He demonstrated its immutability to the
entire universe (The Great Controversy, p. 503). It will be kept for-
ever (Isa. 66:22, 23).

 DISCUSSION QUESTION: One of your friends asks how you
  have enough time to get everything done when you take an
  entire day off for worship. How would you explain the benefits
 of the Sabbath?

SUMMARY: The Sabbath, as a part of God's eternal law, involves a
relationship between both God and humanity (Exod. 20:8-11). The
Sabbath declares the two principles of love for God and love for
humanity (Matt. 22:37-40). It reveals God's character of love. Both
the cross and the Sabbath are eternal gifts for humanity.

     EFR7    Women Lead Out in Western Pacific
                             Carole Ferch-Johnson

          In the islands of the South Pacific, the culture dictates that
      men carry leadership and power, and women follow and obey.
      But the culture is changing, and the church is changing as well.
      Ministers often have up to 15 churches in their district, and must
      rely on local leadership to carry on the church's outreach. At the
      same time, financial constraints have forced many men to leave
      their villages and seek work in the cities. They may be gone for
      months at a time. In some areas the church has been left with only
      a few men but many capable women to look after its affairs.
      Adventist women are assuming leadership roles in these churches
      to fill the vacuum.
          In the village of Sofura, Adventist women began learning
      church leadership and witnessing techniques by practicing with
      members of their own church. They learned to pray with people
      in their own homes, and decided to visit non-Adventists as well.
      The women began making social calls, and always tried to con-
      clude their visit with prayer.
          Two women visited an elderly couple and noticed that their
      house needed repair. The women discussed the problem and
      decided to help fix the house. They went into the bush, cut sago
      palm leaves for thatch, then dried it in the sun. They asked some
      Adventist men to help them repair the house for the elderly
      couple. The two old people were overjoyed, and said, "You
      Seven Day people are very good fella!"
          In another village a group of women walked several hours to
       visit a village where an Adventist teacher worked. There they
      taught the villagers hygiene and health principles. On another
       visit they taught the people how to prepare food that will not spoil
      quickly in the tropical heat. They took needed clothes to the
       people, and ministered to them.
          The women decided it was time to hold meetings. They asked
       the village elders for land for a church. Because of the women's
       kindness to the villagers, and the good services of the Adventist
       school teacher, the elders gave them land, and even cleared it for
       a church. Although the pastor for this district has 13 churches, the
       women's witnessing in this one village has enabled membership
       in this village to continue to grow.

           Christ or Babylon?




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Gen. 10:8-11; 11:1-9; Rev.
14:8; 17:1-6; 18:1-7, 24.

  MEMORY TEXT: "And there followed another angel, saying,
  Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all
  nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication"
  (Revelation 14:8).

   KEY THOUGHT: Modern "Babylon" consists of the false reli-
gious union that opposes God's truth and people. Because the charac-
teristics of Babylon are outlined in God's Word, we need not be
deceived.

   ANCIENT BABYLON TYPIFIES MODERN "BABYLON." At
the various stages of its existence, ancient Babylon was characterized
by religious confusion. One would think that after the Flood human-
kind would have wished to remain in the closest fellowship with the
true God and to avoid the kind of apostasy that led to the ruin of the
antediluvian world. But it was not so. Instead of learning from the
precedents of history, postdiluvian humanity sought to exalt human
achievement. By choosing their own gods and implementing their
own religious fantasies, they withdrew from the orbit of Jehovah's
love and protection. The result was the fragmentation of human soci-
ety and the abandonment of the patriarchs' spiritual ideals.
   Modern "Babylon" also involves a confusion of religious ideas and
spiritual commitments. Unity of religion on any other basis than Bible
truth constitutes Babylon. The issue confronting every human being
on earth will soon be, To whom should I give my loyalty, to Christ or
to Babylon?

ANCIENT BABYLON (Gen. 10:8-11).

   When was the city of Babylon first built? Who was the builder?
Gen. 10:8-11. What motivated the efforts of the earliest inhabi-
tants of ancient Babylon? Gen. 11:1-9.


   "Babel. . . . According to Gen. 11:9, the name means 'confusion,'
based, evidently, on the fact that the Hebrew verb balal means 'to
confuse.' . . . The temple tower of Babylon, mentioned in historical
records from the beginning of the 2d millennium B.C., which was the
highest and largest of all such structures which stood in historical
times in Mesopotamia, has completely vanished. Excavators found no
more of it than its foundations and a few steps of its stairway. How-
ever, an ancient cuneiform tablet describes this tower, and Herodotus
mentions it; hence it is possible to get a fairly accurate picture of this
famous structure. We know that it was about 300 ft. (c. 91 m.) square
at its base, and more than 300 ft. (c. 91 m.) high, and that it was built
in 7 stages, having on top as its 7th stage a shrine dedicated to the god
Marduk.
    "The tower was repaired from time to time, the last time by
Nebuchadnezzar, who said that he received a command from his god
Marduk to build it so that 'its top might rival heaven.' . . . It was
destroyed by Xerxes."—Seventh-day Adventist Bible Dictionary (re-
vised edition), pp. 108, 109.
    Nimrod and his successors fostered false religion, spiritual confu-
sion, moral and ethical decline.

   To what period of Babylon's history does the book of Revela-
tion allude in predicting the events of the last days? Rev. 7:2;
16:12, 19; 17:3-6; 18:1-4.


   The sealing angel mentioned in Revelation 7:2 and the kings who
destroy modern Babylon (Rev. 16:12) come from "the east" (KJV),
from "the rising of the sun" (Isa. 41:25, RSV; Greek anatoles heliou).
The background to this is that Cyrus, who destroyed ancient Babylon,
came from the east. The Lord said through Isaiah: "I stirred up one
from the north, and he has come, from the rising of the sun, and he
shall call on my name" (Isa. 41:25, RSV; compare Isa. 44:28-45:6).
Cyrus, who came from Persia, east of Babylon, entered Palestine from
the north, near Carchemish, at the bend of the Euphrates. As he and his
army destioyed ancient Babylon, making possible the return of God's
people to their own land, so Christ will destroy modern "Babylon" and
take His people to the heavenly Promised Land (John 14:1-3).

                                                                      57

WHAT IS ANTITYPICAL BABYLON? (1 Peter 5:13).

   To what place was Peter referring when he wrote in 1 Peter
5:13 of "Babylon"?


    "There is no evidence to support the idea that Peter ever labored in
literal Babylon. On the other hand, tradition locates his closing labors
and violent death at Rome. . . . It is known that early Christians often
used the cryptic title 'Babylon' when speaking of the Roman capital,
to avoid political reprisals. . . . There is general agreement among
commentators that Peter here uses the term Babylon for a veiled
reference to Rome."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 589.
    Significantly, the little horn of Daniel 7 grew on the head of the
fourth beast. That is, papal Rome grew out of the pagan Roman
Empire. The little-horn power of Daniel 8 is Rome in both its ancient
and medieval aspects.

  What power is represented by the woman named "Babylon"
depicted in Revelation 17:1-6?


   As the dragon with seven heads and ten horns (Rev. 12:3) "gave his
power and his throne and great authority" (Rev. 13:2, RSV) to the
leopardlike beast of Revelation 13, so the scarlet beast with seven
heads and ten horns of Revelation 17:3 provided support for the
woman Babylon (verses 4-6). The Roman Empire was succeeded by
the papal empire of the Middle Ages. The nations that succeeded the
Roman Empire gave secular support to the established church. In the
early Christian centuries, nonbiblical teachings were accepted by the
church until its theology became confused. This was the foundation of
modern "Babylon." From the second century through the Middle
Ages, errors crept into the Christian church. Paul speaks of the gradual
emergence of modern Babylon in 2 Thessalonians 2:3-7. (See The
Great Controversy, pp. 49, 50.)
   Some errors accepted by the established church in the Middle Ages
were Sunday sacredness, the doctrines of the immortality of the soul
and eternal torment, the teaching that tradition and the authority of the
church are above the Bible, infant baptism, the worship of Mary and
the saints, the doctrine of transubstantiation, the confession of sins to
a priest, penance, purgatory, the infallibility of the pope, and salvation
by faith plus works.
   The sixteenth-century Reformers—Luther, Calvin, Zwingli, Latimer,
and many others—rejected some aspects of papal teaching and re-
turned to the Bible.

HOW TO IDENTIFY MODERN "BABYLON"—Part 1 (Rev. 18:2,
3, 5-7, 24).

   In rejecting many of the teachings of the medieval established
church, the sixteenth-century Reformers accepted the Bible only as
the rule of their faith and practice. The church, they said, is not
superior to the Bible. Tradition is not authoritative in matters of
doctrine. Salvation is by grace alone, not by grace plus works. Good
works and obedience to God's law are the result of His saving grace in
the life. Confession of sin should be made to God, not to people. The
doctrine of transubstantiation is unbiblical. Penance, purgatory, the
worship of Mary and the saints, and the infallibility of the pope are
unscriptural teachings.
   The two main teachings of the medieval church that the Reformers
and their followers did not reject are the immortality of the soul and
Sunday sacredness.

   Since modern "Babylon" began with the false teachings that
came into the early Christian church and into the medieval church,
why do we believe that Revelation 14:8 applies especially to our
day? Wasn't Babylon spiritually fallen in the Middle Ages? Rev.
17:5, 15-18.


   Revelation 17 does not apply only to the medieval period. Babylon
has daughters. She is the "mother of harlots and of earth's abomina-
tions" (Rev. 17:5, RSV). The daughters of the medieval established
church are those modern churches that identify themselves with as-
pects of its teaching. Near the end of time, the powers represented by
the beast and its ten horns will hate Babylon and destroy her (Rev.
17:16, RSV). Babylon "is the great city which has dominion over the
kings of the earth" (verse 18, RSV). Babylon is destroyed at the end of
time along with her supporters (Rev. 18:21; 19:20).
   Any church is part of modern Babylon when it allies itself with
churches teaching nonbiblical doctrines.

  What are some of the unbiblical teachings of modern Babylon?
What positive truths does this religious union oppose? Dan. 7:25;
Rev. 13:16, 17 (compare 7:3); 1 Tim. 6:16; Mal. 4:1-3; Rom. 3:21.


   By contrast with Babylon, Christ offers the true Sabbath (Matt.
24:20), the sleep of death followed by the resurrection (1 Cor. 15:51-
54), the final destruction of the wicked (Rev. 20:9), and salvation by
faith/grace alone (Gal. 2:20).

                                                                   59

HOW TO IDENTIFY MODERN "BABYLON"—PART 2 (Matt.
16:18, 19).

   What unbiblical doctrines are the counterpart to the teachings
of the following passages?

Matt. 16:18, 19

1 John 1:9

James 2:10-12

Col. 2:9

1 Thess. 4:16-18

    Jesus did not teach that the church is built on Peter and the bishops
of Rome through the centuries. Matthew 16:18 contrasts Peter (Greek:
petros), a movable stone, with the immovable Rock (Greek: petra),
Christ, upon whom the church is established. "For no other foundation
can any one lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ" (1 Cor.
3:11, RSV). Peter himself taught that Christ is the foundation of the
church (1 Peter 2:6-8; compare Eph. 2:20). Moreover, He alone is the
Head of the church. No human bishop can usurp His divine authority.
(See Eph. 1:22, 23; 5:23.)
    There is no Bible support for confession of sins to a priest. Only
Christ is our Mediator (1 Tim. 2:5; 1 John 2:1; Heb. 9:15).
    Some churches have gone beyond the sixteenth-century reformers,
teaching that the doctrine of salvation by faith/grace alone releases
believers from the requirement of obeying God's law of Ten Com-
mandments. By contrast, the Bible teaching of obedient works of faith
is unmistakable. The Ten Commandments remain God's great stan-
dard of righteousness to which He asks us to conform by dependence
upon Christ (Rom. 3:31; 7:7, 12, 14; 8:3, 4; Rev. 12:17).
    Other churches deny the full deity of Jesus Christ, asserting that He
is either an inferior deity or merely a human being. The Bible teaches
that Christ is God, equal in authority and power with the Father and
the Holy Spirit (Col. 1:19; John 5:18; 8:58 [compare Exod. 3:14]).
    Yet other churches teach that the saints are secretly raptured to
heaven before Jesus comes. The Bible teaches that not until Jesus
appears with His angels are the saints taken to heaven (1 Thess. 4:13-
18; 1 Cor. 15:51-54).
    Because of their acceptance of the natural immortality of the soul,
many churches today are open to the influence of spiritism. (See Rev.
16:13, 14; 2 Thess. 2:8-12.)

CHRIST'S FINAL CALL (Rev. 18:1-5).

  Study Revelation 18:1-5, and answer these questions:

1. How widespread is Christ's final message?

2. How will the earth be "lightened with his glory" (Rev. 18:1)?

3. Why is the message of Revelation 14:8 repeated?

4. How is Revelation 18:3 being fulfilled?

5. Who are God's people in Babylon (verse 4)? When will they
   come out of Babylon?

   "The Bible declares that before the coming of the Lord, Satan will
work 'with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all
deceivableness of unrighteousness;' and they that 'received not the
love of the truth, that they might be saved,' will be left to receive
`strong delusion, that they should believe a lie.' 2 Thessalonians 2:9-
11. Not until this condition shall be reached, and the union of the
church with the world shall be fully accomplished throughout
Christendom, will the fall of Babylon be complete. The change is a
progressive one, and the perfect fulfillment of Revelation 14:8 is yet
future.
   "Notwithstanding the spiritual darkness and alienation from God
that exist in the churches which constitute Babylon, the great body of
Christ's true followers are still to be found in their communion. There
are many of these who have never seen the special truths for this time.
Not a few are dissatisfied with their present condition and are longing
for clearer light. They look in vain for the image of Christ in the
churches with which they are connected. As these bodies depart fur-
ther and further from the truth, and ally themselves more closely with
the world, the difference between the two classes will widen, and it
will finally result in separation. The time will come when those who
love God supremely can no longer remain in connection with such as
are 'lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of
godliness, but denying the power thereof.'
    "Revelation 18 points to the time when, as the result of rejecting
the threefold warning of Revelation 14:6-12, the church will have
 fully reached the condition foretold by the second angel, and the
 people of God still in Babylon will be called upon to separate from her
 communion. This message is the last that will ever be given to the
 world; and it will accomplish its work."—The Great Controversy,
 pp. 389, 390.

                                                                    61
Friday                                                 August 16
FURTHER STUDY: Study the passages in the book of Revelation
that point to the existence of a powerful anti-Christian religious union
in the last days: Rev. 13:11-17; 14:8-10; 15:2; 16:13, 14; 17:5, 6, 15-
18; 18:1-10; 19:20.

   "It is one of Satan's devices to combine with falsehood just enough
truth to give it plausibility. The leaders of the Sunday movement may
advocate reforms which the people need, principles which are in
harmony with the Bible; yet while there is with these a requirement
which is contrary to God's law, His servants cannot unite with them.
Nothing can justify them in setting aside the commandments of God
for the precepts of men.
   "Through the two great errors, the immortality of the soul and
Sunday sacredness, Satan will bring the people under his deceptions.
While the former lays the foundation of spiritualism, the latter creates
a bond of sympathy with Rome. The Protestants of the United States
will be foremost in stretching their hands across the gulf to grasp the
hand of spiritualism; they will reach over the abyss to clasp hands
with the Roman power; and under the influence of this threefold
union, this country will follow in the steps of Rome in trampling on
the rights of conscience."—The Great Controversy, pp. 587, 588.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Your next-door neighbor is critical of the Adventist church
     because our literature speaks of Sunday-keeping churches
     as part of Babylon. What explanations can you give to allay
     the criticism?

   2. Is it possible to present the second angel's message (Rev.
      14:8) without being critical of other religious denomina-
      tions? If so, how?

   3. Because "the great body of Christ's true followers are still
      to be found" "in the churches which constitute Babylon,"
      what great responsibility rests upon every Seventh-day
      Adventist?

SUMMARY: The book of Revelation employs the historical scenario
surrounding the ascendancy and fall of ancient Babylon to illustrate
the rise and fall of an end-time religious union that will oppose Bible
truth and the people who accept it. Only by knowing and accepting
Bible teaching and remaining in constant fellowship with Christ can
we be assured of His blessing now and eternal life at His coming.

    'C;i1i;Cr           Praise God, We Are Free
                                 J. H. Zachary
          A large crowd gathered on the edge of the community swim-
       ming pool in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to witness a baptism of nearly
       300 new Adventists. Pastor Truneh Wolde-Selassie, Ethiopian
       Union president, with eyes shining with tears, whispered an emo-
       tional, "It is wonderful, wonderful!"
          This baptism signaled a new day for the work in Ethiopia. It
       was the first public baptism held in the 86-year history of the
       Adventist church there. Opposition from the national church and
       the communist government prevented public meetings and bap-
       tisms.
          Pastor Truneh told how his village had been destroyed by a
       religious mob when he was 12 years old. He watched as two
       church leaders were shot; then the gun was pointed at his father.
       Suddenly a man leaped forward and pushed the gun aside shout-
       ing, "Two deaths are enough." Several months before, Truneh's
       father had saved this man's life when he was seriously ill.
          The mob set fire to the village, and the group of terrified
       Adventists fled to the mission office with only the clothes they
       wore. The fire lighted their path as they walked into the night.
          Restrictions and persecution made evangelism difficult. Bap-
       tisms were held secretly at night. A group of communists discov-
       ered one secret baptism and tried to "baptize" the pastor. But God
       protected him, and he escaped their plan to drown him.
          God richly blessed the Addis Ababa public meeting. Seventeen
       cottage meetings have been held under the direction of Filipino
        Pastor Edwin Gulfan, a Bible teacher at the Ethiopian Adventist
       College. The crowd in the open-air stadium grew each night from
       1,500 to 3,000. As the meeting closed, 596 persons were baptized
       and more than 700 joined the baptismal classes.
          Pastor Truneh commented, "At last we are free. We must work
       while we have the opportunity." Hundreds of small groups are
                            preparing the way for a great harvest of souls
                            in a nationwide evangelistic effort in 1996.
                            Pray for Ethiopia, the faithful workers, and
                            the new believers there.

       Christ or the Dragon?




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Rev. 12:17; 13:1-15.

   MEMORY TEXT: "For the Lamb which is in the midst of the
   throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living foun-
   tains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their
   eyes" (Revelation 7:17).

   KEY THOUGHT: Christ the Lamb offers present salvation and
future eternal life. The dragon, Satan, supported by earthly powers
that obey him, offers the pleasures of sin and eternal death.

   THE LAMB AND THE DRAGON. Chapters 4 and 5 of Revela-
tion describe the symbolic vision John received of the heavenly throne
room. He saw God upon the throne (Rev. 4:2-4) and before Him the
heavenly court. "And between the throne and the four living creatures
and among the elders, I saw a Lamb standing, as though it had been
slain" (Rev. 5:6, RSV). The Lamb represents Christ, who by His shed
blood "ransomed for God saints from every tribe and language and
people and nation" (verse 9, NRSV). All heaven rang with a mighty
chorus of praise: "Worthy is the Lamb that was slaughtered to receive
power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and
blessing!" (verse 12, NRSV).
   What a contrast is John's depiction of Satan as "a great red dragon"
(Rev. 12:3, RSV; compare verse 9). This demonic creature not only
caused the fall of one third of the angels (verses 4, 9), he tried to
destroy the infant Jesus and persecuted God's faithful people for
centuries (verses 6, 14). The same dragon will pursue end-time be-
lievers who follow the Lamb (Rev. 12:17).
   Whom will you serve, the dragon or the Lamb?

THE DRAGON OPPOSES THE TEN COMMANDMENTS (Rev.
12:17).

  Why does the dragon make war on those who "keep the com-
mandments of God" (Rev. 12:17)? Isa. 14:12-20; Ezek. 28:11-17.


   Isaiah 14 identifies the king of Babylon with his master, Lucifer, or
Satan, who was cast out of heaven because he coveted the authority
and power of God. Ezekiel 28 identifies the king of Tyre with the
same master, Satan, who was a perfect and blameless angel until
iniquity was found in him (verse 15). By cherishing pride of position,
pride of beauty, and covetousness of God's power, this prince of
demons forfeited his role in heaven. His desire to be "like the most
High" (Isa. 14:14) resulted in tragedy for himself and for one-third of
heaven's angels.
   Satan tries to usurp God's authority by destroying the very basis of
His government—the divine law of love. Hence his bitter antipathy to
those who love God, cherish His law, and depend upon Christ to
reflect His character.

   What did Jesus teach regarding the Ten Commandments? Matt.
5:17-19. What did Paul teach? Rom. 3:31; 7:7, 12, 14; 8:3, 4. What
did John teach? 1 John 2:4; 5:2-5.


   Those who tell you that any one of the Ten Commandments need
not be kept have identified themselves with the dragon. Anyone who
asserts that it is not possible, by God's grace, to obey the Ten Com-
mandments is proclaiming the message of the dragon. The Bible
presents Christ's true servants as "having been set free from sin" and
as "slaves of righteousness" (Rom. 6:18, RSV). Such spiritual victory
is consistent only with obedience to God's commandments.
   "Jesus, looking down to the last generation, saw the world involved
in a deception similar to that which caused the destruction of Jerusa-
lem. The great sin of the Jews was their rejection of Christ; the great
sin of the Christian world would be their rejection of the law of God,
the foundation of His government in heaven and earth. The precepts of
Jehovah would be despised and set at nought. Millions in bondage to
sin, slaves of Satan, doomed to suffer the second death, would refuse
to listen to the words of truth in their day of visitation. Terrible
blindness! strange infatuation!"—The Great Controversy, pp. 22, 23.
    "As the work of Sabbath reform extends, this rejection of the divine
law to avoid the claims of the fourth commandment will become well-
nigh universal."—The Great Controversy, p. 587.

                                                                    65

THE DRAGON OPPOSES THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS (Rev.
12:17).

  What is the "testimony of Jesus" (Rev. 12:17) that the dragon
opposes? Rev. 19:10; 22:8, 9.


    The dragon makes war with those who "have the testimony of Jesus
Christ" (Rev. 12:17). The phrase is translated in various ways: "bear
testimony to Jesus" (RSV); "hold the testimony of Jesus" (NRSV).
The verb to have (Greek: echo) means "to have," "hold," "keep,"
"preserve," "possess," "have at one's disposal," "hold in one's charge
or keeping," "have something in one's heart." The remnant have the
testimony of Jesus as their possession.
    For the meaning of the phrase "testimony of Jesus," study Revela-
tion 19:10. John was about to worship the angel who had been sent to
give him Jesus' testimony about Himself (Rev. 1:1, 2). The angel
identified himself with those who, like John, had received Jesus'
testimony. Who were these? The angel explained: "The testimony of
Jesus is the spirit of prophecy" (Rev. 19:10). Just as John and his
fellow prophets received Christ's testimony regarding Himself, so did
the angel. Because Christ was the source of the message, only He
should be worshiped.
   Revelation 22:8, 9 records that again John fell down to worship
the angel. The angel's response was: "You must not do that! I am a
fellow servant with you and your brethren the prophets" (Rev. 22:9,
RSV). Those who "have" [Greek: echo] the testimony of Jesus (Rev.
19:10) are "the prophets" (Rev. 22:9). The "spirit of prophecy," pos-
sessed by the angel, John, and his fellow prophets, is Jesus' testimony
to them about Himself. "The testimony of Jesus" (Rev. 12:17) is both
the prophetic gift and the messages that come from the prophets.
   The dragon tries to turn people away from the messages of the
prophets and from the truth that the prophetic gift has been manifested
in the last days. (See Joel 2:28-32; Eph. 4:11-14; Matt. 24:24.)
   Speaking of her gift, Ellen White wrote: "There will be a hatred
kindled against the testimonies which is satanic. The workings of
Satan will be to unsettle the faith of the churches in them, for this
reason: Satan cannot have so clear a track to bring in his deceptions
and bind up souls in his delusions if the warnings and reproofs and
counsels of the Spirit of God are heeded."—Selected Messages, bk. 1,
p. 48.
   "Those Seventh-day Adventists who take their stand under Satan's
banner will first give up their faith in the warnings and reproofs
contained in the Testimonies of God's Spirit."—Selected Messages,
bk. 3, p. 84.

THE DRAGON PROMOTES BLASPHEMY (Rev. 13:1-10).

   The first beast of Revelation 13 represents an earthly power that is
motivated, controlled, and directed by Satan, the dragon. "And to it
the dragon gave his power and his throne and great authority" (Rev.
13:2, RSV).

  What is involved in the sin of blasphemy of which this power is
guilty? Rev. 13:1, 5, 6; John 10:33; Luke 5:21.


   Jesus was accused of blasphemy because He claimed to be Deity
(John 10:33). Paul spoke of the rise of a "man of sin" some time after
Christ's death (2 Thess. 2:3, 4). This blasphemous power would op-
pose and exalt itself "above all that is called God, or that is wor-
shipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing
himself that he is God" (verse 4). This power will not be destroyed
until the coming of Jesus (verse 8).
   The first beast of Revelation 13 represents the same power of
which Paul wrote. It "was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two
months" (Rev. 13:5, RSV), 1260 days, or years (A.D. 538-1798)—the
same period during which the little horn of Daniel 7 would rule (Dan.
7:25).
    The medieval state church claimed for its human head the position
and prerogatives of Christ. These claims have been promoted in mod-
ern times. Pope Leo XIII wrote: "But the supreme teacher in the
Church is the Roman Pontiff. Union of minds, therefore, requires,
together with a perfect accord in the one faith, complete submission
and obedience of will to the Church and to the Roman Pontiff, as to
God Himself."—Pope Leo XIII, Encyclical Letter, "On the Chief
Duties of Christians as Citizens," Jan. 10, 1890, quoted in SDA Bible
Students' Source Book, 1962, pp. 683, 684. Leo also wrote: "We [the
pope] hold upon this earth the place of God Almighty."—Encyclical
 Letter, "The Reunion of Christendom," June 20, 1894, quoted in SDA
 Bible Students' Source Book, p. 684.
    The beast offers false gods. (See Matt. 24:26, 27; 2 Cor. 11:14,
15.) Christ, the Lamb, offers the one true God. (See Mark 12:28-
34.)
    Jesus was accused of blasphemy because He forgave sins. (See
 Luke 5:18-21.) The beast power (Rev. 13:1-10) claims the right to
 forgive sins. Canon IX of the Council of Trent (1545-1563) ruled that
 the sacramental absolution by the priest is a judicial statement of
 forgiveness. (See SDA Bible Students' Source Book, 1962, p. 214.)
    The beast cannot forgive. Christ offers true forgiveness and cleans-
 ing (1 John 1:9; Ps. 103:3, 12; Eph. 1:7).

                                                                    67

THE DRAGON INCITES THE BEAST TO PERSECUTE (Rev.
13:7).

   Revelation 12, verses 6 and 14, mentions the efforts of the dragon
to destroy God's true church for a period of 1260 years (represented
by 1260 prophetic days), A.D. 538-1798. This is the same period
spoken of in Revelation 13:5. Forty-two prophetic months of 30 days
each is 1260 days, representing years. During this period the dragon,
Satan, incited the established church of Western Europe to persecute
those who insisted on living by the Bible rather than by tradition.

   How widespread will be the authority of the beast and its power
to persecute? Rev. 13:7, 8.


    The prophecy is not referring only to the authority of the beast
power during the Middle Ages. John was shown its power "over all
kindreds, and tongues, and nations" so that "all that dwell upon the
earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of
life" (Rev. 13:7, 8).

  Describe the intense struggle through which God's faithful people
must pass shortly before the coming of Jesus. Dan. 11:44; 12:1;
Matt. 24:9, 10, 21, 22.


    Any church that practices or advocates intolerance toward those
who reject its teachings identifies itself with the beast power. The
medieval established church of Western Europe persecuted those who
chose to follow the Bible rather than the dictates of the church en-
forced by the state. Revelation 13 points to the revival of this kind of
intolerance. The teachings of the thirteenth-century theologian Tho-
mas Aquinas on this question have never been repudiated:
    "With regard to heretics two points must be observed: one, on their
own side, the other, on the side of the Church. On their own side there
is the sin, by which they deserve not only to be separated from the
Church by excommunication, but also to be severed from the world by
death. . . . Therefore if forgers of money and other evil-doers are
condemned to death at once by the secular authority, much more
reason is there for heretics, as soon as they are convicted of heresy, to
be not only excommunicated but even put to death."—Thomas Aquinas,
Summa Theologica, Part 2 of the 2nd Part, Question XI, Article 3.
    That is the voice of the dragon! You will hear that voice very
loudly proclaiming the same intolerant ideas in the days ahead. (See
The Great Controversy, pp. 605-608.)

THE DRAGON'S VOICE IN THE LAST DAYS (Rev. 13:11-18).

  What is meant by the lamblike beast arising "out of the earth"
(Rev. 13:11, RSV)? Rev. 12:16.


   The first beast rose out of the "sea" (Rev. 13:1). The sea represents
the mass of humanity out of which the nations have emerged. (See
Rev. 17:15; compare Dan. 7:2, 3.) The earth represents a region
relatively free from human population. In the Middle Ages and the
early modern period, the "woman," Christ's faithful believers, fled to
previously uninhabited territories to escape persecution (Rev. 12:14,
16). Thus the early American colonies were established.
   "It had two horns like a lamb" (Rev. 13:11, RSV). The Lamb
represents Christ (Rev. 5:6, 9). Because of their adherence to the
gospel, the early American colonists to some extent reflected the
purity of Christ. Roger Williams'little state, Rhode Island, became
the asylum of the oppressed, and it increased and prospered until its
foundation principles—civil and religious liberty—became the cor-
nerstones of the American Republic."—The Great Controversy,
p. 295.

  In what anti-Christian work will this second beast ultimately
engage? Rev. 13:11-18.


   The prophecy predicts that the United States will ultimately emu-
late and cooperate with the first beast power (Rev. 13:1) in establish-
ing a church-state union and in enforcing the kind of worship that
characterized the medieval church of Western Europe. The last phrase
of Revelation 13:12 ("whose mortal wound was healed," RSV) estab-
lishes that this second beast functions after 1798 when the first beast
received its deadly wound. The healing of the wound occurs when
papal religion is restored and the church-state union is again set up.
We can expect that this second beast will perform its prophetic role at
that time. In speaking "like a dragon" (Rev. 13:11, RSV), the once-
lamblike beast enforces apostate worship, performing deceptive miracles
to persuade everyone to support and "worship the image of the beast"
(verse 15). Apostate churches will persuade the government to pass
laws supporting an unbiblical kind of worship. "Satan determines to
unite them in one body and thus strengthen his cause by sweeping all
into the ranks of spiritualism."—The Great Controversy, p. 588. The
second beast power of Revelation 13 is the "false prophet" (Rev.
16:13; 19:20; 20:10); it represents the perversion of true Protestant-
ism.

                                                                    69
Friday                                                 August 23
FURTHER STUDY: In the book of Revelation, along with the beast
itself, the "image of the beast" is portrayed as the great end-time
enemy of the people of God. Study: Rev. 14:9, 11; 15:2; 16:2; 19:20;
20:4.
   Note how the "dragon" (Revelation 12), the "beast" (Rev. 13:1),
and the "false prophet" (Rev. 16:13) are the three great powers that
prepare the world for destruction at the second coming of Jesus. The
dragon, Satan, and his "demonic spirits" (Rev. 16:14, RSV) are the
evil forces inciting the "beast" and the "false prophet."

   "You know that Satan will come in to deceive if possible the very
elect. He claims to be Christ, and he is coming in, pretending to be the
great medical missionary. He will cause fire to come down from
heaven in the sight of men to prove that he is God. We must stand
barricaded by the truths of the Bible."—Medical Ministry, pp. 87, 88.
   "By thousands of voices, all over the earth, the warning will be
given. Miracles will be wrought, the sick will be healed, and signs and
wonders will follow the believers. Satan also works with lying won-
ders, even bringing down fire from heaven in the sight of men. Rev-
elation 13:13. Thus the inhabitants of the earth will be brought to take
their stand."—The Great Controversy, p. 612.
   "The time is coming when Satan will work miracles right in your
sight, claiming that he is Christ; and if your feet are not firmly
established upon the truth of God, then you will be led away from your
foundation. The only safety for you is to search for truth as for hid
treasures."—E. G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7,
p. 911.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What evidences of the influence of spiritism do you see in
     our world today?

   2. There is increasing pressure from some sources in the United
      States to lessen the separation between church and state.
      How do you react to this attempt?

SUMMARY: The dragon and his agents oppose God's law and offer
false prophets, a substitute god, human priests who claim to forgive
sins, and persecution for those who reject a church-state union. By
contrast, Christ offers the power to keep His law, true prophets who
teach His truth, worship of the only true God, a heavenly High Priest
and Mediator, and eternal life in His kingdom for those who trust Him.

     ‘C;41iF          Before You Pray I Will Answer
                                   Beatrice Buku
            I live in Kinshasa, the capital city of Zaire. I was not satisfied
         with the church I had grown up in, but I did not know which of
         the many churches to attend. Yet my heart was hungry to know
         God better. One Saturday morning I prayed, "God, there are so
         many churches, please choose the church that is best for me."
            I finished praying, and wondered how God would answer this
         prayer. Soon after, a messenger came to tell me that my sister
         had just given birth. I prepared some food to take to her and set
         off to see her.
            When I was on my way, I saw a group of people worshiping
         inside a tent. I stopped. These people were worshiping quietly,
         without beating drums or dancing as is common in many African
         churches. I stepped closer to the tent and listened. A pastor was
         preaching, telling the people how much Jesus loves us. I placed
         my package of food down by the door and went in and sat down
         to listen. I stayed for the entire worship service. I watched as the
         pastor walked out and began shaking everyone's hand. The members
         shook one another's hands too. When I reached the back, I asked
         someone which church this was. That person took me to the
         pastor and introduced me to him. He shook my hand and greeted
         me.
             I told him I liked the way he conducted his worship—quietly,
         without drums and dancing. I asked him if I could join his group.
         The pastor told me that we meet here every Sabbath morning,
         and again on Wednesday and Friday evenings.
             After I visited my sister, I returned home and told my husband
         about my prayer that morning, and how within an hour God had
         showed me the Adventist church. I said I wanted to return each
          week. My husband had never heard of the Adventists, but did not
                                 object to my attending. My husband is so
                                 good! He allows me to bring the children to
                                 the Adventist church and has not objected
                                 to the change in our family diet.
                                     I encourage others to pray, and be ready
                                 for God to answer, even as he answered my
                                 prayer.

               Christ's Seal
             or Satan's Mark?




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Rev. 6:11-17; 7:1-3; 13:11-
18; 14:1-5, 9-11.

   MEMORY TEXT: "And in their mouth was found no guile: for
   they are without fault before the throne of God" (Revelation
   14:5).

   KEY THOUGHT: At the end of time are two classes of people: those
who have the seal of God and those who have the mark of the beast. Only
those who have the seal of God will be ready to meet Jesus.

   THE GREAT CONTROVERSY between Christ and Satan cul-
minates in the final separation of lost and saved at Jesus' second
advent (Matt. 25:31-46). God's decision regarding who belongs in
which category is based on whether people have responded to the
voice of His Spirit or to the goading of evil spirits. The conflict
between the Holy Spirit and evil demons in the lives of human beings
becomes more intense as the end of time draws near. While "the Spirit
and the Bride say, 'Come' " (Rev. 22:17, RSV), "demonic spirits,
performing signs [miracles]" (Rev. 16:14, RSV) incite everyone to
reject the conviction of sin and to rebel against God.
   Those who respond to the Spirit's voice, accepting Christ as Sav-
iour and Lord and doing His will as revealed in Scripture, receive the
end-time seal of God. Those who accept the control of demons turn
away from Christ, reject His law, and receive the mark of the beast.
   Whom will we serve, Christ or Satan? Our response to the Sabbath/
Sunday issue will determine how we answer that question.

THE BEAST'S POWER WILL BE ACKNOWLEDGED (Rev. 13:
16-18).

   In our previous lesson we identified three great powers working at
the end of time to subvert God's truth and to destroy His people. They
are the dragon (Revelation 12), the leopardlike beast (Rev. 13:1-10),
and the lamblike beast (Rev. 13:11-18). Elsewhere in Revelation they
are called "the dragon," "the beast," and "the false prophet" (Rev.
16:13). The dragon is Satan (Rev. 12:9), who used the Roman Empire
(verse 4) and the medieval church (verses 6, 14, 15) in an attempt to
destroy Christ and His people. The leopardlike beast of Revelation
13:1-10 represents the papacy in both its medieval and end-time roles.
The lamblike beast (Rev. 13:11-18) represents apostate Protestantism,
which, in cooperation with the papacy, will provoke the government
of the United States to pass religious laws that undermine Bible truth.

   As you study Revelation 13:16-18, consider the following ques-
tions:
   How many of earth's inhabitants are obliged to receive the
mark of the beast?

  Why is there an alternative place for the mark ("on the right
hand or the forehead" [verse 16, RSV])?

   What is the mark of the beast?

   It is clear from Revelation 13:14 that the work of the lamblike
beast is worldwide: "it deceives those who dwell on earth" (RSV). All
classes of humanity around the world are confronted by the demand to
receive the mark of the beast (verse 16).
   The alternative to the mark of the beast is the seal of God (Rev. 7:1-
8; 14:1-5). The seal of God is placed only in the foreheads of commit-
ted believers. The "hand" by contrast with the "forehead" (Rev. 13:16)
implies that some people will be mentally committed to the legislation
enforcing the mark of the beast and some will not. Some will accept
the demands made upon them because they will fear reprisals if they
do not.
   In identifying the mark of the beast, we are looking for the mark or
sign of papal authority. We can expect this mark of religious power to
be accepted by other churches and enforced by government laws.

    What current trends do you see pointing to the fulfillment of
 this prophecy? Do you see any special significance in the move-
 ment in the United States to abolish the wall of separation be-
 tween church and state?

                                                                     73
Monday                                                 August 26
WHAT IS THE MARK OF THE BEAST? (Rev. 13:16, 17).

  What is the sign or seal of God's creative and redemptive
power? Exod. 31:13-17; Ezek. 20:12, 20; Matt. 24:20; Rev. 14:7.


    In Scripture the words sign and seal are sometimes used synony-
mously. For example, speaking of Abraham, Paul wrote: "He received
circumcision as a sign or seal of the righteousness which he had by
faith while he was still uncircumcised" (Rom. 4:11, RSV). Abraham
was not saved by circumcision; he was saved by grace, which he
accepted by faith. But circumcision was the sign, or seal, of the saving
experience. Of course, since the cross, circumcision as a religious rite
is no longer necessary (Rom. 2:28, 29).
   God's sign, or seal, of His creative and redemptive work is the
seventh-day Sabbath. The Sabbath is a sign that He is the Creator
(Gen. 2:1-3; Exod. 20:8-11).
   The Sabbath is also a sign of sanctification or holiness (Exod.
31:13; Ezek. 20:12). The gift of holiness was made possible by Christ's
death and His gift of the Holy Spirit (1 Peter 1:2). Thus the Sabbath
is a sign or seal of the righteousness- and salvation-by-faith experi-
ence.

   What sign or mark of its authority does the papacy claim?


    Satan chose a counterfeit day of worship as the sign, or mark, of his
authority. Sunday observance is claimed by the papacy as the mark of
its religious authority.
    "Roman Catholics acknowledge that the change of the Sabbath was
made by their church, and declare that Protestants by observing the
Sunday are recognizing her power. In the Catholic Catechism of
Christian Religion, in answer to a question as to the day to be ob-
served in obedience to the fourth commandment, this statement is
made: 'During the old law, Saturday was the day sanctified; but the
church, instructed by Jesus Christ, and directed by the Spirit of God,
has substituted Sunday for Saturday; so now we sanctify the first, not
the seventh day. Sunday means, and now is, the day of the Lord.'
    "As the sign of the authority of the Catholic Church, papist writers
cite 'the very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday, which Protes-
tants allow of. . . .'—Henry Tuberville, An Abridgment of the Chris-
tian Doctrine, page 58. What then is the change of the Sabbath, but
the sign, or mark, of the authority of the Roman Church—`the mark of
the beast'?"—The Great Controversy, p. 447, 448.

WHEN DO PEOPLE RECEIVE THE MARK OF THE BEAST?
(Rev. 13:12-17).

  The answer is found in Revelation 13:12-17:

   Has the lamblike beast as yet exercised "all the authority of the
first beast in its presence" (verse 12, RSV)?

   Has the lamblike beast as yet "[made] the earth and its inhabit-
ants worship the first beast, whose mortal wound was healed"
(verse 12)?

  Has the lamblike beast yet deceived the whole world "bidding
them make an image for the beast which was wounded by the
sword and yet lived" (verse 14)?

   Has the lamblike beast yet caused all to obey secular laws
enforcing a decree of the church (verse 16)?

  Has the lamblike beast applied an economic boycott to those
who refuse the mark of the beast (verse 17)?

    "Christians of past generations observed the Sunday, supposing
that in so doing they were keeping the Bible Sabbath; and there are
now true Christians in every church, not excepting the Roman Catho-
lic communion, who honestly believe that Sunday is the Sabbath of
divine appointment. God accepts their sincerity of purpose and their
integrity before Him. But when Sunday observance shall be enforced
by law, and the world shall be enlightened concerning the obligation
of the true Sabbath, then whoever shall transgress the command of
God, to obey a precept which has no higher authority than that of
Rome, will thereby honor popery above God. He is paying homage to
Rome and to the power which enforces the institution ordained by
Rome. He is worshiping the beast and his image. As men then reject
the institution which God has declared to be the sign of His authority,
and honor in its stead that which Rome has chosen as the token of her
supremacy, they will thereby accept the sign of allegiance to Rome—
 `the mark of the beast.' And it is not until the issue is thus plainly set
before the people, and they are brought to choose between the com-
mandments of God and the commandments of men, that those who
continue in transgression will receive 'the mark of the beast.' "—The
 Great Controversy, p. 449.

   What fearful punishment will those receive who worship the
 beast and its image and receive its mark? Rev. 14:9-11.

                                                                       75

SEALED BY CHRIST'S CHARACTER (Rev. 14:1).

  What is the seal in the foreheads of God's end-time people?
Rev. 7:1-3; Rev. 14:1.


   The Greek of Revelation 14:1 translates: "having His name and His
Father's name written upon their foreheads." (Compare Rev. 3:12;
22:4.) The Father's name and Christ's name are symbols of their
character.
   The psalmist wrote: "I will give to the Lord the thanks due to his
righteousness, and I will sing praise to the name of the Lord, the Most
High" (Ps. 7:17, RSV). The Lord's name is the symbol of His right-
eousness. When we praise the name of the Lord, we praise His holy
character. The psalmist also wrote: "Ascribe to the Lord the glory of
his name" (Ps. 29:2, RSV). The Lord's glory is His infinitely perfect
character.

   How does Christ give us His character? Eph. 1:13, 14; Rev. 3:5;
6:11; 19:7, 8.


   The Holy Spirit brings Christ's righteousness to the heart of every
true Christian (Rom. 8:9, 10). Enjoying the new-birth experience
(John 3:1-16), we have the initial seal of the Spirit, the "guarantee of
our inheritance until we acquire possession of it" (Eph. 1:14, RSV).
   The presence of the Spirit in our hearts enables spiritual growth
toward complete victory over sin, which is the prerequisite to recep-
tion of God's end-time seal. Those whose names are retained in the
book of life are overcomers through Christ's power (Rev. 3:5). Rev-
elation 6:11 translates literally: "And there was given to each of them
[the righteous dead] a white robe, and it was said to them that they
should rest a little longer, until their fellow servants and their breth-
ren, who are about to be killed as they were, might be made com-
plete." By the power of the Holy Spirit, God's end-time people are
made completely victorious in Christ during the "marriage of the
Lamb," the pre-advent judgment (Rev. 19:2, 7, 8). Then they are
sealed in their foreheads. Their names are eternally retained in the
book of life, and Satan has no more power over them. (See Early
Writings, pp. 270, 271.)
   God's name, His character, is revealed by His creative and redemp-
tive work, of which the Sabbath is the sign (Exod. 20:8-11; Exod.
31:13). Those who receive the bestowal of Christ's character by the
gift of the Holy Spirit observe the seventh-day Sabbath as the great
memorial of, and aid to, their spiritual victory in Christ.

WHEN DO CHRIST'S LAST-DAY PEOPLE RECEIVE THE
END-TIME SEAL? (Rev. 6:14-17; 7:1-3).

   What answer to this question can you draw from Revelation
6:11-7:3?


    Revelation 6:11 is fulfilled when the fifth seal is broken on the
little scroll that Christ has taken from the hand of the Father (Rev. 5:6,
7; 6:9). The dead are vindicated in the pre-advent judgment (Rev.
6:11). Their living brethren are made "complete," "perfect," in the
sense of victorious over sin, during the same pre-advent judgment.
Then Christ comes (Rev. 6:12-17). The question asked in verse 17 is
answered in Revelation 7:1-8. Those who are able to stand without
fear as Jesus comes in the clouds are those who are sealed in their
foreheads before the winds of strife are let loose, before the close of
probation.
    "Reference to our published works will show our belief that the
living righteous will receive the seal of God prior to the close of
probation."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 66.
    "The only hope for any man lies through Jesus Christ. . . . The pure
and holy garments are not prepared to be put on by any one after he
has entered the gate of the city. All who enter will have on the robe of
Christ's righteousness, and the name of God will be seen in their
foreheads. This name is the symbol which the apostle saw in vision,
and signifies the yielding of the mind to intelligent and loyal obedi-
ence to all of God's commandments."—Sons and Daughters of God,
p. 370.
    "Just before we entered it [the time of trouble], we all received the
seal of the living God. Then I saw the four angels cease to hold the
four winds. And I saw famine, pestilence and sword, nation rose
against nation, and the whole world was in confusion."—Ellen White
Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 968.

  What are the spiritual characteristics of living believers when
Christ comes? Rev. 14:4, 5; 15:2-4.


   Those who receive the end-time seal of God are the righteous
living on the earth when Jesus comes. They stand unafraid as Jesus
appears in the heavens (Rev. 6:17; 7:1-3). They are "redeemed from
the earth" (Rev. 14:3, RSV), "from mankind" (verse 4, RSV). "These,
having been translated from the earth, from among the living, are
counted as 'the first fruits unto God and to the Lamb.' "—The Great
Controversy, p. 649. (Compare Early Writings, p. 15.)

                                                                      77

FURTHER STUDY: Revelation 14:5 may be translated: "And in
their mouth no lie was found, for they are spotless" (RSV). The word
translated "spotless" or "without fault" (KJV) is used in the following
texts. How does the teaching of these passages support that of Revela-
tion 14:5? Eph. 1:4; 5:27; Col. 1:22; Jude 24.

   "None but those who have been overcoming by the blood of the
Lamb and the word of their testimony will be found with the loyal and
true, without spot or stain of sin, without guile in their mouths. We
must be divested of our self-righteousness and arrayed in the right-
eousness of Christ...
   "That which God required of Adam before his fall was perfect
obedience to His law. God requires now what He required of Adam,
perfect obedience, righteousness without a flaw, without shortcoming
in His sight. God help us to render to Him all His law requires. We
cannot do this without that faith that brings Christ's righteousness into
daily practice."—Selected Messages, bk. 2, pp. 380, 381.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Why is it vitally important that we do not assume that
     Sunday keepers at the present time have the mark of the
     beast?

   2. Because the sealing of believers is the work of the Holy
      Spirit, what part should we play in seeking the Spirit's
      outpouring upon the church and upon ourselves individu-
      ally?

   3. Why is it dangerous to postpone total commitment to Christ
      until the image to the beast is set up?

   4. How would you explain to a questioner the spiritual mean-
      ing of the Sabbath for you?

SUMMARY: The seal of God is the gift of the character of Christ to
thoroughly committed believers. Because the Sabbath is the sign, or
seal, of God's creative and redemptive authority, those who are sealed
are faithful Sabbath keepers. They will be the righteous living on the
earth when Jesus comes. The mark of the beast is the sign of papal
authority, the counterfeit Sabbath, Sunday observance. Those who
accept the image to the beast, obeying the government's decree en-
forcing Sunday keeping, will receive the mark of the beast.

                                    J. H. Zachary

            My wife and I bumped along the narrow path in our jeep as we
         headed into the rugged highland of central Mindanao, Philip-
         pines, to visit a primitive tribe. Tall grasses grew along the trail,
         blocking our view of the road ahead. As we rounded a sharp turn,
         I hit the brakes and stared, amazed at the sight ahead of us. We
         watched, transfixed, as a house crossed the road in front of us.
            As we waited for this unusual parade, we learned the story
         behind the "walking house." A man had built his family a home
         beside a nearby river. During the rainy season the river rose and
         flooded the home. The unhappy wife scolded her husband. "You
         must move this house," she demanded.
            The man visited the village chief, who summoned all avail-
         able villagers to help. Men and boys cut long, sturdy bamboo
         poles and placed them in even rows under the house. Then every
         able-bodied person placed a shoulder under one of the bamboo
         poles. When the chief gave the command, "Stand up," the house
         rose into the air. With the command to march, the house began to
         walk.
            We waited as the little house crossed the road and climbed the
         hill to higher ground, where it was set in its new location.
            The owner could not move the house by himself. It took
         every village member working together to move the house.
             As we waited that day I thought how a pastor or an evangelist
         cannot reach a city by himself. It takes every member working
         together to get the job done. All the Adventist pastors in the
         world cannot reach the more than 5 billion people on this planet.
         It will take every member, filled with the Holy Spirit, to move
         the world for God.
             The people of the Philippines have a word to describe moving
         a house, bayanihan [ba-yah-NEE-han], which means "we all
                                                       work together." If we
                                                       all work together, we
                                                       will get the job done.

      Christ's Counsel Before
      the Close of Probation




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Acts 2:14-24; 16:12-16; 18:1-
24.

   MEMORY TEXT: "And when these things begin to come to
   pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption
   draweth nigh" (Luke 21:28).

   KEY THOUGHT: As we consider the final events on Planet
Earth, we must focus on Who is coming, not merely on what is
coming. The final events are Christ-centered rather than crisis-
centered.

   FINAL EVENTS ON PLANET EARTH WILL TAKE PLACE
RAPIDLY. Concerning the effect of Sunday laws, we read: "This
national apostasy will speedily be followed by national ruin."—Last
Day Events, p. 134.
   "The agencies of evil are combining their forces and consolidating.
They are strengthening for the last great crisis. Great changes are soon
to take place in our world, and the final movements will be rapid
ones."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 11.
   "Thousands in the eleventh hour will see and acknowledge the
truth. . . . These conversions to truth will be made with a rapidity that
will surprise the church, and God's name alone will be glorified."
—Selected Messages, bk. 2, p. 16.
   "When probation ends, it will come suddenly, unexpectedly—at a
time when we are least expecting it. But we can have a clean record in
heaven today, and know that God accepts us."—Last Day Events,
p. 230.

Sunday                                                September 1
FOCUS ON CHRIST, NOT THE CRISIS (Ps. 16:8).

   In what way is Enoch a type of those to be translated at the
second coming? Gen. 5:22.


   "We can have what Enoch had. We can have Christ as our constant
companion. Enoch walked with God, and when assailed by the tempter,
he could talk with God about it. He had no 'It is written' as we have,
but he had a knowledge of his heavenly Companion. He made God his
Counsellor, and was closely bound up with Jesus. And Enoch was
honored in this course. He was translated to heaven without seeing
death. And those who will be translated at the close of time, will be
those who commune with God on earth."—Ellen G. White Comments,
SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 1087.
   After his son's birth, "the infinite, unfathomable love of God through
Christ became the subject of his meditations day and night. With all
the fervor of his soul he sought to reveal that love to the people among
whom he dwelt."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 8, p. 329.

   In what way is the experience of Moses instructive for the end-
time remnant? Heb. 11:27.


   The Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, led by Moses, is a type of
our final exodus from this world to the heavenly Canaan. "He looked
to God and trusted in Him for strength to carry him uncorrupted
through every form of temptation. He knew that a special work had
been assigned to him, and he desired as far as possible to make that
work thoroughly successful. But he knew that he could not do this
without divine aid, for he had a perverse people to deal with. The
presence of God carried him through the most trying situations.
   "Moses did not merely think of God; he saw Him. God was the
constant vision before him; he never lost sight of His face. He saw
Jesus as his Saviour, and he believed that the Saviour's merits would
be imputed to him. This faith was to Moses no guesswork; it was a
reality. This is the kind of faith we need, faith that will endure the test.
Oh, how often we yield to temptation because we do not keep our eye
upon Jesus!"—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 652. (See Ps.
16:8; 25:15; Acts 2:25.)

     From Ellen White's first vision in Early Writings, pages 13 to
20, (1) in what way alone are God's people safe? and (2) what is
 the fundamental difference between those who arrive safely to
 heaven and those who do not?

                                                                        81
Monday                                             September 2
THE CROSS AS CENTRAL TO FINAL EVENTS (Acts 2:14-24).

  What days did the first coming of Christ inaugurate? 1 Cor.
10:11; Heb. 1:2; 1 John 2:18.


   In the New Testament the final events of this earth's history are
presented in three dimensions—past, present, and future. The term
last day or last days has reference to past, present, and future time.
Christ launched the last days by His first advent (Heb. 1:2; 1 John
2:18). Those last days are present and about to culminate in the "last
day" (John 6:39, 40). Christ came as the "last Adam" (1 Cor. 15:45),
providing a new beginning for the race and launching the gospel age
that culminates in the new earth (Revelation 21).

   What does prophecy tell us will come in the last days? Acts
2:17-21; compare Joel 2:28-32.


   The Holy Spirit was bestowed at Pentecost (Acts 2). But the signs
in the sun, moon, and stars did not take place then. The signs in the
natural world were fulfilled for the first time in the past two centuries
(Matt. 24:29). These signs will be repeated just before Christ comes
(Joel 3:15; Isa. 13:9, 10; Rev. 6:12, 13; Ezek. 32:7, 8).
   The events of Pentecost and the end time, separated from each
other by nearly two millennia, are referred to as the "last days." Thus,
the "last days" are synonymous with the Christian Era, or the time of
the new covenant (Jer. 31:31; Heb. 8:8; 12:24).

  Why is this age called the "last days"? John 19:30. (See SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 974.)


   Christ's victorious cry, "It is finished," made eternally sure Satan's
ultimate destruction. Calvary means Satan, sin, and sinners are fin-
ished. Time lingers longer so the onlooking universe can understand
issues involved in the great controversy and so that others on earth can
come to Christ (2 Peter 3:9). But at the cross the decisive battle took
place. Events in the world, particularly final events, unmask the fury
of the defeated foe. He is causing havoc. But he has lost! "Finished!"
is written over all his evil schemes. They cause damage but cannot
change the outcome. As we look at final events, we must do so in the
light of the final event—Calvary.

      Describe the importance of Calvary for your spiritual life.

SPIRITUALISM (Rev. 16:12-16).

   Besides the Sunday law, what other avenue will Satan use to
take the world captive? Rev. 16:13, 14.


   Three "evil spirits," a triumvirate counterfeit of the three angels of
Revelation 14:6-13, work through three avenues to capture the world.
Those three avenues are (1) the dragon (paganism; note that the
dragon in Revelation 12 is primarily Satan [verse 9] and secondarily
pagan Rome [verse 4]), (2) the beast (Catholicism), and (3) the false
prophet (apostate Protestantism; see SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7,
p. 844). These three "spirits of demons" work "miraculous signs" to
deceive the world and to lead it into the final battle of Armageddon.
Here is presented a prophecy about the impact of spiritualism in the
end time. "Through the two great errors, the immortality of the soul
and Sunday sacredness, Satan will bring the people under his decep-
tions."—The Great Controversy, p. 588.

   How does the New Age movement fulfill Revelation 16:12-16?


   The New Age movement is a spiritistic phenomenon. Channeled
bibles, such as The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ (1907), The
Urantia Book (1955), and A Course in Miracles (1975) claim to fill in
the lost years of Christ, from age 12 to 30, with new revelations from
heaven. They present Jesus as a mere man who became a god; all
humans can become gods. They deny the need of the cross.
   The New Age movement calls for a global consciousness, involv-
ing all humans' thinking alike, and preparing for the coming of Christ,
who will teach a new, exalted religion. (Compare The Great Contro-
versy, pp. 499, 589; Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 56.) It is alleged that
He has developed beyond His teachings of two thousand years ago.
This idea denies the eternal validity of the Bible. Spiritualism appeals
to the miraculous just as Satan did in Eden. The philosophy is "seeing
is believing." Satan appeals to the senses to deny God's Word. (See
Gen. 3:2-6.)

   How does the charismatic movement fulfill Revelation 16:12-
16? Can tongues speakers focus on a phenomenon instead of
 upon God's Word? (See Last Day Events, pp. 159, 160.)


   How will miracles be a test to Adventists? 1 Tim. 4:1; Rev.
13:14. (See Selected Messages, bk. 2, p. 53.)

                                                                      83
Wednesday                                          September 4
THE COUNTERFEIT PRECEDES THE GENUINE (Rev. 13:11-
15).

   How will Satan's counterfeit religion even duplicate biblical
events in order to claim authenticity? Rev. 13:13; compare
1 Kings 18:24.


   The Mount Carmel test will be counterfeited. Satan will make it
appear that a biblical test establishes his deity.
   "Satan will come in to deceive if possible the very elect. He claims
to be Christ, and he is coming in, pretending to be the great medical
missionary. He will cause fire to come down from heaven in the sight
of men to prove that he is God."—Medical Ministry, pp. 87, 88.
   "It is impossible to give any idea of the experience of the people of
God who will be alive on the earth when past woes and celestial glory
will be blended. They will walk in the light proceeding from the
throne of God. By the means of the angels there will be constant
communication between heaven and earth. And Satan, surrounded by
evil angels, and claiming to be God, will work miracles of all kinds to
deceive, if possible, the very elect. God's people will not find their
safety in working miracles, for Satan would counterfeit any miracle
that might be worked."—Selected Messages, bk. 2, pp. 54, 55.

  What will precede the loud cry of Revelation 18:1-4? Matt.
24:11-14.


   "I saw that God has honest children among the nominal Adventists
and the fallen churches, and before the plagues shall be poured out,
ministers and people will be called out from these churches and will
gladly receive the truth. Satan knows this; and before the loud cry of
the third angel is given, he raises an excitement in these religious
bodies, that those who have rejected the truth may think that God is
with them."—Early Writings, p. 261.
   "Before the final visitation of God's judgments upon the earth there
will be among the people of the Lord such a revival of primitive
godliness as has not been witnessed since apostolic times. . . . The
enemy of souls desires to hinder this work; and before the time for
such a movement shall come, he will endeavor to prevent it by intro-
ducing a counterfeit. In those churches which he can bring under his
deceptive power he will make it appear that God's special blessing is
poured out; there will be manifest what is thought to be great religious
interest."—The Great Controversy, p. 464.

Thursday                                            September 5
THE FINAL INVITATION TO THE WORLD (Rev. 18:1-24).

   How do the three angels' messages relate to God's final appeal
to the world? Rev. 14:6-13; 18:1-4.


   The three angels' messages (Rev. 14:6-13) will climax in the "loud
cry," the final call for all humanity to come to Christ (Rev. 18:1-4).
This is the final invitation to come out of Babylon before the plagues
(Rev. 18:4, 8; compare 16:1-21). Just as Satan's counterfeit "three evil
spirits" go to the whole world (Rev. 16:12-16, NIV), so the three
angels' messages will reach their finale in the loud cry.

   Study the third angel's message, and give evidence for its par-
ticular relevance to the time after the Sunday law. Rev. 14:9
(compare Rev. 13:12-15).


   How will the Sunday law, to which the loud cry responds, be a
sign to us, indicating our method of giving the final message?
Luke 21:20, 21; Rev. 13:14-16.


   "The time is not far distant, when, like the early disciples, we shall
be forced to seek a refuge in desolate and solitary places. As the siege
of Jerusalem by the Roman armies was the signal for flight to the
Judean Christians, so the assumption of power on the part of our
nation in the decree enforcing the papal sabbath will be a warning to
us. It will then be time to leave the large cities, preparatory to leaving
the smaller ones for retired homes in secluded places among the
mountains."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, pp. 464, 465. (Com-
pare The Great Controversy, pp. 30, 31.)
   "As God's commandment-keeping people, we must leave the
cities. As did Enoch, we must work in the cities but not dwell in
them."—Evangelism, pp. 77, 78.
   "Study carefully in the book of Acts the experiences of Paul and the
other apostles, for God's people in our day must pass through similar
experiences."—Last Day Events, p. 148.

    Remind yourself of the wonderful assurances of Christ's pres-
 ence with His faithful people in the difficult experiences they
 must face before He comes. Matt. 10:19, 20; John 16:33; Rom.
8:38, 39; Rev. 7:14-17. "The true Christian will stand firm as a
 rock, his faith stronger, his hope brighter, than in days of pros-
 perity."—The Great Controversy, p. 602.

                                                                      85
Friday                                             September 6
FURTHER STUDY: Read Rev. 18:1-4; "The Loud Cry," "The Close
of Probation," Last Day Events, pp. 197-214; 227-230; "The Final
Warning," The Great Controversy, pp. 603-612; "The Seal of God,"
"The Impending Conflict," Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5,
pp. 207-216; 711-718.

   There is a double worldwide gathering under way. "Satan is mar-
shaling his hosts."—The Adventist Home, p. 186. He seeks to become
the leader of the world (Rev. 16:12-16). His "agents still claim to cure
disease. They attribute their power to electricity, magnetism, or the
so-called 'sympathetic remedies.' In truth they are but channels for
Satan's electric currents. By this means he casts his spell over the
bodies and souls of men."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 193.
Significantly, the New Age movement speaks of people's aligning
themselves with the cosmic energy flow for healing. "It is the lying
wonders of the devil that will take the world captive."—Selected
Messages, bk. 2, p. 51.
   At the same time, through meditation techniques, people are being
trained to open their minds to receive whatever comes. Evil spirits
enter and take over, bypassing the conscious mind. A generation is
being prepared to participate in this kind of mindless global con-
sciousness. Such routines are common in different parts of the world,
even in some grade schools. It is Satan's studied strategy to prepare
the world for his coming as the assumed Christ.
   Ellen G. White was given a vision of the modern development of
spiritualism. Read Early Writings, p. 263.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What encouraging events in the future will strengthen us to
     withstand the almost overwhelming deceptions of Satan?
     (See Joel 2:28, 29; Rev. 3:8-13.)

   2. What steps can we take to protect our children and youth
      from the insidious evils that are influencing their minds:
      morally degraded television programs, toys and games in-
      vented by demons, the influence of highly emotional,
      charismatic-style religious services.

SUMMARY: To cope successfully with the challenges of the future,
we must focus daily on Christ. By constant communion with Him, we
can be overcomers as was Enoch and can reflect His love to all around
us. When political and religious forces threaten to destroy us, we have
the wonderful assurance that nothing can separate us from Christ. His
love and companionship are ours for eternity.

                    Jeffry's Answered Prayer—Part 1
                               Joko Soewarso

             Twelve-year-old Jeffry Leo and his family moved to
         Pangkalang (PAHN-kah-lahng) Bum, a small city on the southern
         coast of Borneo, where Jeffry's parents managed a restaurant.
         Jeffry liked his new home, and was eager to make some Ad-
         ventist friends, but his family could not find the church. In
         fact, no one they talked to knew of Adventists.
             Jeffry felt lonely. He missed worshiping in his former church.
         He and his sister prayed that God would help them meet some
         Adventists, so they could worship together on Sabbath.
             Jeffry kept asking his friends at school if they knew anyone
         who kept the Sabbath, but no one knew. One day a classmate
         told him of a family that lived across the river who worshiped
         on Saturday instead of Sunday. He did not know the family's
         name or exactly where they lived.
             Jeffry was so excited that as soon as school ended that day
         he hurried down to the river, hired a boat, and crossed to the
         other part of town. He did not know what he would find, if he
         could even find anything, but he was determined to look.
             When Jeffry reached the riverbank, he began asking people
         if they knew someone who kept the Sabbath. Finally he met
         someone who remembered a family who worshiped on Sab-
         bath. The man directed Jeffry to a furniture company. Jeffry
         hurried in the direction the man pointed. The furniture com-
         pany was closed, but the manager was still there. Jeffry asked
         the man if he knew of any Sabbathkeepers in the area. The
         manager looked at Jeffry a long time, then directed him to the
         home of Mr. Fang.
             Jeffry almost ran to the Fangs' home. A Chinese man an-
                                 swered his knock and looked out at this
                                 young boy standing there. "Please, sir, are
                                 you Adventists?" Jeffry asked hopefully.
                                                    (continued next week)

                                Jeffry Leo (left) lives in Southern

           Christ's Care After
           Probation's Close




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S LESSON: Dan 12:1; Rev. 13:15, 16-
19.

  MEMORY TEXT: "In the world ye shall have tribulation: but
  be of good cheer; I have overcome the world" (John 16:33).

   KEY THOUGHT: Events after the close of probation demonstrate
the wickedness of Satan and the love and justice of God.

   THE PRE-ADVENT CLIMAX TO THE GREAT CONTRO-
VERSY COMES AFTER PROBATION'S CLOSE. "Just before
we entered it [the time of trouble], we all received the seal of the
living God. Then I saw the four angels cease to hold the four winds.
And I saw famine, pestilence and sword, nation rose against nation,
and the whole world was in confusion."—SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 7, p. 968.
   "An angel returning from the earth announces that his work is
done; the final test has been brought upon the world, and all who have
proved themselves loyal to the divine precepts have received 'the seal
of the living God.' Then Jesus ceases His intercession in the sanctuary
above. He lifts His hands and with a loud voice says, 'It is done.' "
—The Great Controversy, p. 613.
   When probation closes, God's remnant on earth will have been
sealed (Rev. 7:1-4); they have given the final message (Rev. 18:1-4)
and are almost ready for translation (1 Thess. 4:16-18). Then the great
time of trouble begins (Dan. 12:1). There will be trouble for both the
saved and the unsaved. What is that trouble, and what is its cause?

Sunday                                             September 8
SATAN HAS ENTIRE CONTROL OF THE IMPENITENT (Dan.
12:1).

   What is the difference between the time of trouble after probation's
close and the time of trouble during the period of papal supremacy
(A.D. 538-1798)? Compare Dan. 12:1 with Matt. 24:21, 22.


   The "great tribulation" (Matt. 24:21) of which Jesus spoke is the
same "time of trouble" (Dan. 12:1) of which Daniel wrote. The differ-
ence in the two passages is that Jesus was using historical events as
types of the ultimate end-time tribulation. Matthew 24:21, 22, in its
context, may refer to (1) the tribulation associated with the destruction
of Jerusalem in A.D. 70; (2) the tribulation during the period of papal
supremacy; (3) the ultimate tribulation just before Jesus comes, of
which the previous two times of trouble were types. (See The Great
Controversy, pp. 25, 36, 39, 266, 267.)

  Why will the end-time trouble be the worst ever? Rev. 7:1-3;
13:15.


   Revelation 7:1-3 indicates that the angels hold the winds of strife
only as long as the sealing of the saints is in process. Once the sealing
is completed, the angels loose the winds of strife. "Satan will then
plunge the inhabitants of the earth into one great, final trouble. As the
angels of God cease to hold in check the fierce winds of human
passion, all the elements of strife will be let loose. The whole world
will be involved in ruin more terrible than that which came upon
Jerusalem of old."—The Great Controversy, p. 614.
   Satan and his angels are powerful (Eph. 6:12; 1 Peter 5:8).
"The same destructive power exercised by holy angels when God
commands, will be exercised by evil angels when He permits. There
are forces now ready, and only waiting the divine permission, to
spread desolation everywhere."—The Great Controversy, p. 614.
   "Satan has entire control of the finally impenitent."—The Great
Controversy, p. 614. (See Rev. 22:11.)
    Satan says, " 'Our principal concern is to silence this sect of
Sabbathkeepers. . . . We will finally have a law to exterminate all who
will not submit to our authority.' "—Testimonies to Ministers,
pp. 472, 473. "It is the purpose of Satan to cause them to be blotted
from the earth in order that his supremacy of the world may not be
disputed."—Last Day Events, p. 255.



                                                                      89
Monday                                             September 9
THE SEVEN LAST PLAGUES (Rev. 16:1-21).

   Why was John given the vision of the saved in heaven (Rev.
15:2-4) after he was shown "seven angels with the seven last
plagues" (verse 1, NIV) and before the actual beginning of the
plagues (Rev. 15:5-16:1)?


   The vision of Revelation 15:2-4 was not given to demonstrate that
the saved will be in heaven during the pouring out of the plagues on
earth. The righteous living on the earth when Jesus comes in glory
"have come out of the great tribulation" (Rev. 7:14, RSV). The vision
of Revelation 15:2-4 depicts those upon whom the plagues did not fall
because, while on earth, they gained the victory over the beast, its
image, and its mark (verse 2). These victorious ones are presented in
shining contrast to unbelievers, who will suffer the plagues.
   "While the wicked are dying from hunger and pestilence, angels
will shield the righteous and supply their wants. To him that `walketh
righteously' is the promise: 'Bread shall be given him; his waters shall
be sure.'. . . Isaiah 33:15, 16, 41:17."—The Great Controversy,
p. 629.

   Will God send the plagues? Rev. 16:1, 5, 7, 19 (compare Exod.
7:1-5, 17; 8:2, 19, 21; 2 Peter 2:4-6, 9).


   God sent the plagues on Egypt, just before He delivered His people.
These plagues were a type of the final plagues God sends on the world
before He delivers His people to take them to the heavenly Canaan.
   "God's love is represented in our day as being of such a character
as would forbid His destroying the sinner. Men reason from their own
low standard of right and justice. . . . God is a moral governor as well
as a Father. He is the Lawgiver. He makes and executes His laws. Law
that has no penalty is of no force."
   "The plea may be made that a loving Father would not see His
children suffering the punishment of God by fire while He had the
power to relieve them. But God would, for the good of His subjects
and for their safety, punish the transgressor. God does not work on the
plan of man. He can do infinite justice that man has no right to do
before his fellow man. Noah would have displeased God to have
drowned one of the scoffers and mockers that harassed him, but God
drowned the vast world. Lot would have had no right to inflict punish-
ment on his sons-in-law, but God would do it in strict justice."—Last
Day Events, pp. 240, 241.

SATAN IMPERSONATES CHRIST (2 Cor. 11:14).

   What was Satan's original quest in heaven? Ezek. 28:11-17;
Isa. 14:12-14.


   "Little by little Lucifer came to indulge the desire for self-
exaltation. . . . Not content with his position, though honored above
the heavenly host, he ventured to covet homage due alone to the
Creator. . . . And coveting the glory with which the infinite Father had
invested His Son, this prince of angels aspired to power that was the
prerogative of Christ alone."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 35.

  Who are the central figures in the great controversy? Rev.
12:7-11. What will Satan dare to do in the end time? 2 Cor. 11:14.


   Michael is the name given to Christ. (Compare Dan. 10:13, 21;
12:1; Jude 9.) Revelation 12 gives a brief overview of the great
controversy in four different battles, in which Christ and Satan are the
principal contestants.

   "As the crowning act in the great drama of deception, Satan himself
will personate Christ. The church has long professed to look to the
Saviour's advent as the consummation of her hopes. Now the great
deceiver will make it appear that Christ has come. In different parts of
the earth, Satan will manifest himself among men as a majestic being
of dazzling brightness, resembling the description of the Son of God
given by John in the Revelation. Revelation 1:13-15. The glory that
surrounds him is unsurpassed by anything that mortal eyes have yet
beheld. The shout of triumph rings out upon the air: 'Christ has come!
Christ has come!' The people prostrate themselves in adoration before
him, while he lifts up his hands and pronounces a blessing upon them,
as Christ blessed His disciples when He was upon the earth. His voice
is soft and subdued, yet full of melody. In gentle, compassionate tones
he presents some of the same gracious, heavenly truths which the
Saviour uttered; he heals the diseases of the people, and then, in his
assumed character of Christ, he claims to have changed the Sabbath to
Sunday, and commands all to hallow the day which he has blessed. He
declares that those who persist in keeping holy the seventh day are
blaspheming his name by refusing to listen to his angels sent to them
with light and truth. This is the strong, almost overmastering delu-
sion."—The Great Controversy, p. 624.



                                                                     91
Wednesday                                           September 11
NO MEDIATOR (Rev. 8:2-5).

   What is meant by John's vision of Christ's casting the censer
into the earth? Rev. 8:2-5 (compare Rev. 22:11; 7:3; 15:5, 8).


   "I saw angels hurrying to and fro in heaven. An angel with a
writer's inkhorn by his side returned from the earth and reported to
Jesus that his work was done, and the saints were numbered and
sealed. Then I saw Jesus, who had been ministering before the ark
containing the ten commandments, throw down the censer. He raised
His hands, and with a loud voice said, 'It is done.' And all the angelic
host laid off their crowns as Jesus made the solemn declaration,
[Revelation 22:11 quoted]."—Early Writings, pp. 279, 280.
   Even though Christ's heavenly intercession for sinners will cease at
the close of probation, His sealed people will be kept from sin by the
indwelling Holy Spirit. "It is the latter rain which revives and strengthens
them to pass through the time of trouble."—Testimonies for the Church,
vol. 1, p. 353. "Evil angels still pressed around them, but could have
no power over them."—Early Writings, p. 271.

   What trouble did Jeremiah prophesy for Israel at the time of
the Babylonian invasion? Jer. 30:5-7. Apart from his fear of physical
harm, how is Jacob's night of wrestling a type of the trouble that
God's people will face after the close of probation? Gen. 32:24-26.


   "The people of God will then be plunged into those scenes of
affliction and distress described by the prophet as the time of Jacob's
trouble. . . . [Jer. 30:5-7 quoted]."—The Great Controversy, p. 616.
   "As Satan accuses the people of God on account of their sins, the
Lord permits him to try them to the uttermost. Their confidence in
God, their faith and firmness, will be severely tested. As they review
the past, their hopes sink; for in their whole lives they can see little
good. They are fully conscious of their weakness and unworthiness.
Satan endeavors to terrify them with the thought that their cases are
hopeless, that the stain of their defilement will never be washed away.
He hopes so to destroy their faith that they will yield to his tempta-
tions and turn from their allegiance to God. . . . But while they have a
deep sense of their unworthiness, they have no concealed wrongs to
reveal. Their sins have gone beforehand to judgment and have been
blotted out, and they cannot bring them to remembrance."—The Great
Controversy, pp. 618-620.

Thursday                                          September 12
HOW DO WE PREPARE FOR THE CLOSE OF PROBATION?
(2 Peter 3:8-18).

  As you study 2 Peter 3:8-18, ask yourself these questions:


   Why did Jesus not come as soon as some thought He would?
(verses 8, 9).

   In what sense will Jesus come "like a thief" (verse 10, NIV)?

   What biblical definitions can you give for "holiness" (verse
11, RSV), "godliness" (verse 11), "righteousness" (verse 13)?

   How can we be "without spot, and blameless" (verse 14)?

   How can we avoid "the error of lawless men" that causes us
to lose our spiritual "stability" (verse 17, RSV)?

    Many passages in Scripture indicate that the Lord wishes His people
to be spiritually blameless. (See 1 Cor. 1:8; Phil. 2:15; 1 Thess. 5:23; 2
Peter 3:14.)
    "God requires the homage of a sanctified soul, which has prepared
itself, by the exercise of the faith that works by love, to serve Him. He
holds up before us the highest ideal, even perfection. He asks us to be
absolutely and completely for Him in this world as He is for us in the
presence of God.
    " 'This is the will of God' concerning you, 'even your sanctifica-
tion.' 1 Thessalonians 4:3. Is it your will also? Your sins may be as
mountains before you; but if you humble your heart, and confess your
sins, trusting in the merits of a crucified and risen Saviour, He will
forgive, and will cleanse you from all unrighteousness. God demands
of you entire conformity to His law. This law is the echo of His voice
saying to you, Holier, yes, holier still. Desire the fullness of the grace
of Christ. Let your heart be filled with an intense longing for His
righteousness, the work of which God's word declares is peace, and its
effect quietness and assurance forever.
    "As your soul yearns after God, you will find more and still more of
 the unsearchable riches of His grace. As you contemplate these riches,
 you will come into possession of them, and will reveal the merits of
 the Saviour's sacrifice, the protection of his righteousness, the full-
 ness of His wisdom, and His power to present you before the Father
 `without spot, and blameless.' 2 Peter 3:14."—The Acts of the Apostles,
 pp. 566, 567.


                                                                      93
Friday                                            September 13
FURTHER STUDY: The message to Sardis has vital counsel for
those preparing for the seal of God and for the close of probation.
Study Revelation 3:1-6. Read "The Time of Trouble," The Great
Controversy, pp. 613-634.

   "The injunction to be blameless and harmless [Phil. 2:15] does not
teach that we may remain in a passive state. If Christians aspire no
higher than a mere negative virtue, we may well anxiously inquire,
what is to become of those who know not Christ nor the truth? Who
will reach out their hands to save them? 'Blameless' here means
unadulterated, sincere; it expresses an active piety. We are to let our
light shine upon others, that its bright beams may reflect glory to the
great Source of light. Our Heavenly Father is not a hard master; he
requires of no man more or less than he gives him ability to do. 'Unto
whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required.' Every
one has earnest work to do for God. Every one upon whom God has
bestowed the gift of reason has some influence over others. By the
blessing of God, that influence can be used to save souls. We shall
individually be held responsible for doing an iota less than God has
given us ability to do. He measures our strength; he gives us work
which we can do, and which we must do if we ever hear from his lips
the heavenly benediction, 'Well done, good and faithful servant.' "
—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, April 24, 1883.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What kind of material preparation can we make for the
     time of trouble after the close of probation?

   2. Why does the Lord allow His people to suffer the "time of
      Jacob's trouble" after the close of probation? (See The
      Great Controversy, pp. 621, 622.)

   3. What negative results can there be in allowing our minds to
      dwell too much on the time of trouble ahead for the people
      of God?

SUMMARY: The wicked suffer the seven last plagues after the close
of probation because they have finally rejected the loving appeals of
the Holy Spirit. The righteous suffer during the time of Jacob's trouble
because Satan is permitted to afflict them; even though, by the power
of the Holy Spirit, they are being kept from sinning, their characters
need further positive refinement before Jesus comes. Daily commun-
ion with Christ through prayer and through study of His Word, along
with willingness to share His love with others, is the means by which
we prepare for the close of probation.

                     Jeffry's Answered Prayer—Part 2
       U1.7                        Joko Soewarso
           Twelve-year-old Jeffry stood expectantly at the door of the
        Fang home. "Please, sir, are you Adventists?" he asked the man
        who answered his knock.
           "Yes, we are," the man answered. "Why do you ask?"
           "Our family is Adventist too!" Jeffry answered excitedly. The
        man invited Jeffry in to talk. Jeffry was disappointed to learn that
        there was no Adventist church in their town.
           "Please come and visit us this Sabbath," Jeffry pleaded. Mr.
        Fang promised to visit Jeffry's family as soon as possible. Jeffry
        was so happy! Now the family would not have to worship alone
        on Sabbath. It was getting dark as he hurried home.
           "Where have you been?" Jeffry's mother asked him sternly.
           "Oh, Mother! I found an Adventist family today!" Quickly
        Jeffry told his parents about his afternoon's adventure and the
        Fang family's promise to visit them. How could Jeffry's parents
        be angry when their son was so eager to worship with Adventists'?
           Jeffry's father had good news, too. He had met a woman, Mrs.
        Napit, who sold Adventist books. She stayed with the Irwan fam-
        ily, whom she had met earlier. They wanted to study the Bible.
           "Maybe we can study together this week," Mrs. Napit said. The
        two arranged to meet at the Irwan's home that week.
           Jeffry's family invited the Fang family to join them. The group
        enjoyed visiting and studying the Bible together. The Fang family
        had a daughter, and the Irwan family had several children. God
        had sent many new friends!
           The group worshiped together regularly. The Irwan family de-
        cided to become Adventists. A pastor came to study with the small
        group of believers, then they held evangelistic meetings in the
        Irwans' home. About 20 people came. Eight people wanted to
        become Adventists. The Irwan family and some of their relatives
        already have been baptized.
                                  Jeffry's prayer has been answered. God
                               sent him a special friend and a whole new
                               church family. Now his prayer is that they
                               can have a church to worship in.

      Christ the Resurrection
           and the Life




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Gen. 2:7; John 11:11; Rom.
5:12-18; 1 Cor. 15:12-23.

   MEMORY TEXT: "I am the resurrection, and the life: he that
   believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live" (John
   11:25).

   KEY THOUGHT: Christ's death and resurrection make possible
the resurrection of all the dead. Some will be raised for eternal life and
some for eternal death.

   SATAN COUCHED HIS LIE IN A VISUAL AID. (See Gen.
3:1-4). The first surprise to Eve was to hear a serpent talking in human
language. The second surprise was to see the serpent eating of the
forbidden fruit. The serpent said in effect: "Look, Eve, I am eating the
fruit. Am I dead? Look what the fruit has done for me. If this fruit did
so much for me, you as a human may become like God."
   The whole thrust of Satan's speech through the mouth of the ser-
pent was: "Look how much you could improve yourself if you were to
eat the fruit. God is keeping back marvelous advancement from you.
This is why He said you will die. He is a liar. Eat, and you will become
truly liberated and exalted." To Eve, seeing was believing. She be-
lieved her senses, made the decision, and ate. Ever since that fatal
temptation in Eden, Satan has promoted his first lie ("you shall not
die") by appealing to the senses.
   What is death? What hope is there beyond the grave? How does the
Bible unmask Satan's deceptions?

WHAT IS DEATH? (John 11:11).

  What did Christ's great miracle, the raising of Lazarus, reveal
about the state of man in death? To what did Jesus liken death?
John 11:6, 7, 11-14.


   Throughout Scripture death is represented as an unconscious state.
Consistently, death is compared to sleep. (See Deut. 31:16; Job 14:10-
12; Dan. 12:2; Matt. 27:52; Mark 5:39; Acts 7:60.) There is no indica-
tion in Scripture that part of a person sleeps in death while another
part remains alive and conscious.

  What do the following passages teach regarding the degree of
knowledge possessed by the dead?

Eccl. 9:5, 6, 10

Job. 14:21

Ps. 6:5

Ps. 115:17

   How does the Bible answer the question Where are the dead?
Isa. 26:19; Job 14:14; 17:13-16.


   The dead are not in heaven or hell in spirit form. They are resting in
their graves, waiting for the resurrection morning.
   The sleep of death is a blessing. If the dead were in heaven seeing
the struggles and suffering of their living loved ones, how could they
ever be happy? If the dead were in hell suffering the torture that
popular belief depicts for those who have not served Christ, how could
we ever accept the Bible message regarding the love of God?
   The concept of life immediately after death is never taught in the
Hebrew or Greek Scriptures. It originated with Greek philosophy and
came into Jewish thought in the Hellenistic period (the fourth through
the first centuries B.C.). The Pharisees borrowed the doctrine of the
immortality of the soul from Greek sources. This doctrine came into
the Christian church largely through the influence of the Jewish author
Philo and the Alexandrian Christian theologians Clement
(c. 150—c. 215) and Origen (c. 185—c. 254). The doctrine of the
 immortality of the soul is the basis of modern spiritism, including the
New Age philosophy.

                                                                     97

WHAT DOES THE BIBLE TEACH REGARDING THE SOUL?
(Gen. 2:7).

   Describe the process by which God created humanity? Gen.
2:7. Describe what happens when a person dies. Ps. 146:3, 4.


    The Bible does not teach that God created an immortal soul for
humans. A living soul consists of a body plus the breath of life. The
obvious implication is that, if the breath of life is withdrawn, the
individual would be a dead soul. If souls can die, they are not immor-
tal. Immortality is the capacity never to die.

   What do the following passages teach regarding the soul?

Ezek. 18:4

Rev. 16:3

Num. 6:6

Matt. 10:28

Gen. 1:20, 21, 30; 2:19

   "The soul that sins shall die" (Ezek. 18:4, RSV). "All have sinned
and fall short of the glory of God" (Rom. 3:23, RSV). Therefore,
every human soul is a sinner subject to death. Human souls can die;
they are not immortal. Revelation 16:3 uses the Greek word for "soul"
(psuche). The word body in the King James Version of Numbers 6:6
translates the Hebrew word for "soul" (nephesh). The word creature is
used to translate the Hebrew word for "soul" in the King James
Version of Genesis 1:20, 21, 30; 2:19. In these texts animals are
spoken of as souls. God made animals living souls just as He made
Adam a living soul. Like humans, when animals die, they become
dead souls. (See Eccl. 3:19-21.)
   The breath of life within humans and animals is never referred to in
the Bible as an immortal, conscious entity that survives the death of
the body. Ecclesiastes 12:7 teaches that the life principle God has
given to a person is taken back by God when the individual dies. If the
"spirit" (Eccl. 12:7, RSV) that returns to God is the immortal part of
humankind, all people, good and bad, would go to heaven at death.
   Only God has immortality (1 Tim. 6:15, 16).

HOW DID DEATH COME INTO OUR WORLD? (Rom. 5:12).

   What event introduced sin and death into our world? Rom.
5:12.


    The result of Adam's sin was death. Romans 5:12 has been inter-
preted in various ways:
1. Augustine (A.D. 354-430) interpreted the verse to mean that, be-
     cause all humanity sinned in Adam, all share in Adam's guilt and
     are, therefore, subject to death.
2. All die because, like Adam, they choose to sin. All become sinners
     at the point at which they choose to sin.
3. Sinfulness and mortality are the results of Adam's sin, shared by
     every human being.
    The first view, the doctrine of original sin, runs counter to the
justice of God spelled out in Scripture. "The son shall not suffer for
the iniquity of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the
son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the
wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself' (Ezek. 18:20, RSV).
We were not in Adam when he sinned; we do not share in his guilt.
Mortality for the entire race is a result of Adam's fall, not a punish-
ment for his guilt.
    The second view fails to recognize that all human beings are born
with fallen natures having tendencies to sin. The psalmist wrote,
"Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother
conceive me" (Ps. 51:5, RSV). He was a sinful human being at the
moment of conception.
    "The result of the eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil
is manifest in every man's experience. There is in his nature a bent to
evil, a force which, unaided, he cannot resist. To withstand this force,
to attain that ideal which in his inmost soul he accepts as alone
worthy, he can find help in but one power. That power is Christ.
Cooperation with that power is man's greatest need."—Education,
 p. 29.
    The third view is the scriptural position. The result of Adam's sin is
 that every human being is born sinful, in the sense that all are born
 with fallen natures and propensities to sin. Moreover, all are born
 mortal. "The living know that they will die" (Eccl. 9:5, RSV).
    In the light of the above, how can we explain Romans 5:18?
 Condemnation to death for all was the result of Adam's sin, not the
 punishment for it. Because the fallen Adam was mortal, he could only
 transmit mortality to his children. Thus, "death spread to all men"
 (Rom. 5:12, RSV). "All men sinned" when Adam sinned, but only in
 the sense that the results of his sin are suffered by all.

                                                                      99

WHAT DID CHRIST'S DEATH AND RESURRECTION ACCOM-
PLISH? (Rom. 5:17).

   Just as we were not in Adam when he sinned, so we were not in
Christ when He died. Christ died for us. His death was on our behalf.
We did not die when Christ died; we die to sin when we accept His
suffering and death as the punishment for our sins.

   What results of the cross are available to every human being?
1 Peter 2:24, 25; Rom. 5:17.


    It is when, in response to the conviction of the Holy Spirit, we
return "to the Shepherd and Guardian" of our souls (1 Peter 2:25,
RSV) that we "die to sin and live to righteousness" (verse 24, RSV).
The cross is absolutely central to our salvation, but we must accept
Christ now to experience the salvation made possible then.
     Romans 5:18 must be considered in relation to verse 17. Christ's
death makes "acquittal and life" available for all (verse 18, RSV). But
only "those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of
righteousness" will "reign in life through one man Jesus Christ" (verse
17, RSV).
    "It is peace that you need—Heaven's forgiveness and peace and
love in the soul. . . . It is yours if you will but reach out your hand and
grasp it. . . .
    "In like manner you are a sinner. You cannot atone for your past
sins, you cannot change your heart, and make yourself holy. But God
promises to do all this for you through Christ. You believe that prom-
ise. You confess your sins, and give yourself to God. You will to serve
Him. Just as surely as you do this, God will fulfill His word to you. If
you believe the promise—believe that you are forgiven and cleansed—
God supplies the fact; you are made whole, just as Christ gave the
paralytic power to walk when the man believed that he was healed. It
is so if you believe it."—Steps to Christ, pp. 49-51.
    "If through faith man becomes one with Christ, he can win life
everlasting."—Selected Messages, book 1, p. 300.

   When does Christ bestow everlasting life? John 3:36; 5:24;
1 John 5:11-13. When does He bestow immortality? 1 Cor. 15:51-
54.


    What does acceptance of the gift of eternal life do for your
 sense of security?

WHO WILL TRIUMPH OVER DEATH? (1 Cor. 15:23).

   What great event makes it certain that those who accept Christ
will triumph over death? 1 Cor. 15:12-22. Who at Christ's coming
will triumph over death? 1 Cor. 15:23.


   Christ's resurrection makes possible the resurrection of the right-
eous dead. If He had not risen from the dead, "those also who have
fallen asleep in Christ [would] have perished" (1 Cor. 15:18, RSV).
Believers before and after the cross would have no hope of life after
death if Jesus had not risen from the grave.

  Who are the ones "who belong to Christ" (1 Cor. 15:23, RSV)?
Rom. 8:9-17.


   The first seventeen verses in Romans 8 are alive with the love and
power of Christ—love and power bestowed upon every willing be-
liever by the indwelling Holy Spirit. "There is now no condemnation
for those who are in Christ Jesus (verse 1, NIV). The righteous re-
quirements of the law can be "fully met" in those "who do not live
according to the sinful nature but according to the Spirit" (verse 4,
NIV). Life and peace are experienced by those who are "controlled by
the Spirit" (verse 6, NIV). Only those belong to Christ in whose hearts
the Holy Spirit is living (Rom. 8:9, 10). If the Spirit is living in us, "he
who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal
bodies through his Spirit, who lives in you" (verse 11, NIV). The gift
of the Spirit brings the gift of eternal life now and the gift of immortal-
ity at Jesus' coming.

  Of what two resurrections does the Bible speak? John 5:29;
Acts 24:15 (compare 1 Thess. 4:13-18; Rev. 20:4-6).


   "Amid the reeling of the earth, the flash of lightning, and the roar
of thunder, the voice of the Son of God calls forth the sleeping saints.
He looks upon the graves of the righteous, then, raising His hands to
heaven, He cries: 'Awake, awake, awake, ye that sleep in the dust, and
arise!' Throughout the length and breadth of the earth the dead shall
hear that voice, and they that hear shall live. And the whole earth shall
ring with the tread of the exceeding great army of every nation,
kindred, tongue, and people. From the prison house of death they
come, clothed with immortal glory."—The Great Controversy, p. 644.


                                                                       101

FURTHER STUDY: What did Paul mean when he longed "to be
absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord" (2 Cor. 5:8)?
Compare Phil. 1:23.

    "From a superficial reading of vs. 6-8 some have concluded that at
death the soul of the Christian goes immediately to be 'present with
the Lord,' and that Paul, ardently desiring to be with the Lord (v. 2),
welcomed death. But in vs. 3, 4 Paul describes death as a state of being
`naked,' or 'unclothed.' He hopes, if at all possible, to avoid this
intermediate state, and ardently desires to be 'clothed' with his 'house
. . . from heaven.' In other words, he hopes to be translated without
seeing death. . . . Elsewhere (see on 1 Cor. 15:51-54; 1 Thess. 4:15-17;
2 Tim. 4:6-8, etc.) Paul makes it certain that men are not 'clothed'
with immortality individually at death, but simultaneously at the res-
urrection of the just."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6,
p. 863.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. The mother of a friend who believes in the natural immor-
     tality of the soul passes away. At the funeral your friend
     approaches you weeping and exclaims, "I know she is in
     heaven now!" In those particular circumstances, how would
     you respond?

   2. Why is it vital in these last days that everyone understands
      the Bible teaching on the state of the dead? What can the
      results be for those who do not understand the Bible truth?

   3. How could you use this week's lesson to comfort a person
      who is terminally ill?

SUMMARY: Death is a sleep, a state of unconsciousness. The Bible
teaches that a living person is a mortal soul; a dead person is a dead
soul. The soul is not immortal. Even though Adam's sin introduced sin
and death into our world, Christ's sacrificial death earned eternal life
for all. By accepting Him as Saviour and Lord, eternal life is ours now
and immortality at His second coming.

                     The Deadly Serpent
                            James Bahr


    This is war!
    When we arrived in Rupim*, India, to work among the Hindu
people as tentmaker missionaries, we prayed earnestly that God
would lead us to honest souls who were searching for truth. The
city's mayor and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Pol*, had encouraged us
to come to help the people there, and opened their home to us
until our apartment would be ready. While living with them we
learned valuable lessons that helped us adapt to our new home.
    Mrs. Pol is a Christian, and we enjoy studying the Bible and
The Great Controversy together. She expressed an eagerness to
translate the book so she could share it with others! We praised
God for this news!
    We talked as we walked across her veranda toward the dimly-
lit doorway of the house. Suddenly Mrs. Pol jerked her foot up
with a startled look. I swung my flashlight around and spotted a
snake slithering away. She held the flashlight on the snake while
I ran to get something to kill it.
    After killing the deadly viper, I put its still-writhing body in a
bag for identification while my wife, Carol, applied a charcoal
poultice to the wound. Then we raced toward the hospital, first
on bicycle, then rickshaw, then car. Every minute was precious!
    I stayed with Mrs. Pol while she was treated and then admit-
ted, praying and reading Scripture to comfort her. It was long
after midnight when I returned home, and I awakened often
throughout the night to pray for our dear friend.
    Doctors expected Mrs. Pol to die from the deadly venom, but
the next day she met them with a smile on her face, praising God
for delivering her from the serpent. Further blood tests revealed
no trace of venom in her bloodstream.
    Pray for Mr. and Mrs. Pol and the Hindus who are beginning
to come to our small group studies. The serpent, the devil has
many in his grasp, but Christ can save them from the venom of
Satan, for he is a defeated foe!

   *James and Carol Bahr are working as tentmaker missionaries
in a large city in India. Because their work is sensitive, they have
asked that we not use the real names of people or places.

    Christ's Second Coming




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Dan. 12:2; Matt. 24:31;
Rev. 1:7; 13:11-14; 14:1-5.

  MEMORY TEXT: "He which testifieth these things saith, Surely
  I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus" (Revelation
  22:20).

   KEY THOUGHT: The second coming of Jesus with all the holy
angels will be a glorious event witnessed by every person on earth. At
that time, believers will be translated to heaven, and unbelievers will
be put to death.

   COMPASSION FOR UNBELIEVERS should characterize God's
people as Jesus' second coming draws near. Two young men were
walking along a busy sidewalk in a large city. They stopped at an
intersection to wait for the red light to turn green. One of the young
men stepped off the sidewalk just as a car traveling quite rapidly came
around the corner. The other young man grabbed his friend and dragged
him back to safety. The whole crowd waiting there for the lights to
change gasped in relief as the young man narrowly missed being
killed. Suppose his friend had not been willing to act promptly. The
result would have been tragic.
   The Bible teaches that Jesus' coming is near. For us to remain
silent while people rush on heedless of the danger right ahead would
be unforgivable disregard for human life. Warning people of Jesus'
coming is a life-and-death issue.
    What kind of event is Jesus' second coming? What will Jesus do
when He comes? What happens after His coming? When will He
come? How do we prepare for this great event?

EVERYONE ON EARTH WILL WITNESS JESUS' SECOND
ADVENT (Rev. 1:7).

   What kind of event is Jesus' second coming, secret or public?
1 Thess. 4:13-18; 1 Cor. 15:51-54.


   Some influential contemporary Bible interpreters teach that believ-
ers will be taken to heaven in a "secret rapture" seven years before the
glorious appearing of Christ. The only rapture of the saved mentioned
in Scripture occurs at the glorious appearing of Christ and the holy
angels. First Thessalonians 4:14 does not mean that God brings the
righteous from heaven with Him when He comes. It means that He
brings the righteous from the grave as He brought Jesus from the
grave after His crucifixion. The "dead in Christ" rise from the grave
when the Lord descends "from heaven with a shout, with the voice of
the archangel, and with the trump of God" (verse 16). The righteous
do not come down with Christ in this great public coming. They rise to
be with Him for eternity.

   What will happen in the world of nature as Jesus is coming?
2 Peter 3:10; Rev. 16:18-21.


   At Jesus' coming, the upheaval in nature will be the most devastat-
ing worldwide cataclysm in history. There will occur the most terrible
universal earthquake, accompanied by the fiercest hurricane and hail-
storm our world has ever seen.
   "There is a mighty earthquake, 'such as was not since men were
upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.' Verses 17, 18.
The firmament appears to open and shut. The glory from the throne of
God seems flashing through. The mountains shake like a reed in the
wind, and ragged rocks are scattered on every side. There is a roar as
of a coming tempest. The sea is lashed into fury. There is heard the
shriek of a hurricane like the voice of demons upon a mission of
destruction. The whole earth heaves and swells like the waves of the
sea. . . . The proudest cities of the earth are laid low. The lordly
palaces, upon which the world's great men have lavished their wealth
in order to glorify themselves, are crumbling to ruin before their
eyes."—The Great Controversy, pp. 636, 637.

  How many people on earth will see Jesus come? Rev. 1:7;
 Matt. 24:27, 29-31.



                                                                   105

THE PARTIAL RESURRECTION (Dan. 12:2).

   At His trial, what did Jesus predict would eventually happen to
the high priest and the members of the council? Matt. 26:63, 64;
compare Rev. 1:7.


   Who are raised in this partial resurrection? Dan. 12:2.


   Jesus assured Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin that they would be raised
from the dead to see His coming in the clouds of heaven (Matt. 26:63,
64). All those who took part in His unjust trial and crucifixion will be
raised from the dead to witness this glorious event.
   Daniel 12:1 indicates that some righteous people, some who died
with faith in Jesus, will also be raised to witness the advent. This is a
wonderfully kind act on God's part. He wants to give a special reward
to some of the faithful saints because they believed and taught the
Bible truth about His advent. He wants them to see the fulfillment of
their hopes.
   "Graves are opened, and 'many of them that sleep in the dust of the
earth . . . awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and
everlasting contempt.' Daniel 12:2. All who have died in the faith of
the third angel's message come forth from the tomb glorified, to hear
God's covenant of peace with those who have kept His law. 'They
also which pierced him' (Revelation 1:7), those that mocked and
derided Christ's dying agonies, and the most violent opposers of His
truth and His people, are raised to behold Him in His glory and to see
the honor placed upon the loyal and obedient. . . .
   "Those who derided His claim to be the Son of God are speechless
now. There is the haughty Herod who jeered at His royal title and bade
the mocking soldiers crown Him king. There are the very men who
with impious hands placed upon His form the purple robe, upon His
sacred brow the thorny crown, and in His unresisting hand the mimic
scepter, and bowed before Him in blasphemous mockery. The men
who smote and spit upon the Prince of life now turn from His piercing
gaze and seek to flee from the overpowering glory of His presence.
Those who drove the nails through His hands and feet, the soldier who
pierced His side, behold these marks with terror and remorse. With
awful distinctness do priests and rulers recall the events of Calvary."—
The Great Controversy, pp. 637, 643.

   Why do you think God has a partial resurrection before the
 main resurrection?

WHAT DOES JESUS DO WHEN HE COMES? (Matt. 24:31).

   What happens to the living unbelievers, including those who
will be raised in the partial resurrection? Rev. 6:14-17; 14:19, 20;
19:19, 20; 2 Thess. 1:7-10.


   What happens to those who died as unbelievers before Jesus'
second advent? Rev. 20:5.


  What happens to the millions who died as believers? Matt.
24:31; 1 Thess. 4:13-18.


   What happens to the living believers, including those who have
just been raised in the partial resurrection? 1 Thess. 4:16-18.


   What happens to Satan and his demons? Rev. 20:1-3.


    When Jesus arrives with the hosts of His angels, He remains in the
sky above the earth. The saved will "meet the Lord in the air"
(1 Thess. 4:17). Jesus does not come down and walk on earth as He
did when He came the first time. This is why Satan's impersonation of
Christ before the advent will not deceive God's people. (See Matt.
24:23, 24; 2 Thess. 2:8-12.)
    Those who have neither believed in Jesus nor followed His truth as
it is taught in Scripture will be destroyed by the glory of His presence.
Those who crucified Him, who were raised shortly before His appear-
ing, will be put to death again with the hosts of the lost who have
received the mark of the beast. Those who had previously died in sin
will remain in their graves for another 1,000 years.
    When the heavenly trumpet sounds, the many who through the ages
of human history died believing in Jesus Christ are raised from their
graves and caught up into the sky to meet Jesus. Then the living
believers are caught up to be with them. They are not brought back to
this earth again. They are taken to heaven to be with Christ and the
angels for 1,000 years. (See John 14:1-3; Rev. 7:13-17; 20:4-6.)
    Satan and his demons are bound to this desolate earth ("the bottom-
less pit"—Rev. 20:1). The earth will be divested of its inhabitants. All
the saved will be in heaven; all the lost in their graves.



                                                                    107

PROPHETIC SIGNS THAT JESUS' COMING IS NEAR (Rev.
13:11-14).

   The books Daniel and Revelation, along with such chapters as
Matthew 24, focus on the second coming of Jesus. The prophets
predicted the sweep of human history culminating in Christ's estab-
lishment of His kingdom.

   According to the book of Daniel, where are we in the stream of
time? Dan. 2:44, 45; 7:24-27; 8:25; 11:44, 45; 12:1.


  What developing religious union points to the nearness of the
end? Rev. 13:11-14.


  Toward the end, what efforts will evil spirits make to deceive
and destroy humanity? Rev. 16:13, 14.


   The prophetic messages of the book of Daniel establish without
doubt that we are living in the time of the heavenly pre-advent judg-
ment (Dan. 7:9-14; 8:14). Daniel predicted that this judgment would
take place a short time before the second advent of Jesus.
   During this same time, according to the book of Revelation, there
will develop a union between apostate Protestantism and the papacy.
This religious union will eventually link up with pagan spiritist forces
and work miracles as a means of deceiving earth's inhabitants. The
image to the beast (Protestantism emulating the medieval papacy) will
pressure the governments of the United States and other countries to
pass laws that are acceptable to papal religion.
   Are we seeing any movements in the U.S. and other countries to
bring Protestant churches closer to the Roman Catholic church? Are
we seeing any attempts on the part of Protestantism to pressure the
government to pass laws favorable to religion? In fact, the religious
movements within America and some other countries are a remark-
able development toward the fulfillment of the prophecies of Revela-
tion.

    The nearness of Jesus' coming simply emphasizes the need
 for us to look into our hearts to be sure that we are ready to meet
 Him. Is He living within us by the Holy Spirit? Are we studying
 the Bible and praying daily? Are we growing in grace (2 Peter
3:18)? Are we keeping holy His seventh-day Sabbath? (See Matt.
24:20.)

Thursday                                        September 26
ARE YOU READY FOR JESUS TO COME? (Rev. 14:1, 5).

   This is the most important question. Let us briefly remind our-
selves why it is so vital.

   What essential qualification for heaven does God provide be-
lievers in the last days? Rev. 7:3; Rev. 14:1, 5.


   The book of Revelation teaches that we are living in the sealing
time, during which the Lord wishes to place His last-day seal upon
those who are receiving His character by the Holy Spirit and keeping
the seventh-day Sabbath. If we wish to be among the righteous living
when Jesus comes, we must receive His divine seal. This is the sign
that, because His character has been given to us, we have victory over
sin and are loyal to all His commandments. (See Rev. 12:17.)

   What kind of victory must last-day believers receive? Rev.
15:2. How only can we have this victory? 1 John 5:4; Matt. 24:42;
1 Thess. 5:1-11.


   If they seek Him, God will give His last-day people victory over
the beast, its image, and its mark (Rev. 15:2). We will not be deceived
by false religious movements. By faith in Jesus and conformity to His
Word, we will be able to discern error when we see it and hear it. By
watching unto prayer and earnest Bible study, we will always be in a
state of readiness to meet our Lord.

  How important is worship with fellow believers as we come
near to the end? Heb. 10:25.


   A very important part of getting ready to meet Jesus is fellowship
with other Christians who believe as we do. The Bible urges that we
meet together for worship and sharing. We are to support one another's
faith, to encourage one another, and bear one another's burdens (Gal.
6:2). Jesus wants His followers to be loving, caring people. Their love
for other believers, as well as for those who do not believe, is to
demonstrate the value of their faith. When we are bound together in
the love of Christ, then we are ready for heaven (John 17:21-23).

   Are you making ready to meet the Lord? Jesus gently pleads
 that you open your heart's door and let Him rule in your life
 (Rev. 3:20).

                                                                  109
Friday                                            September 27
FURTHER STUDY: Read Revelation 21, 22; "God's People De-
livered," "The Controversy Ended," The Great Controversy, pp. 635-
652, 674-678.

   The end is near, even at the door. It is time to lift up our eyes, for
our redemption draws near (Luke 21:28). We prepare for heaven by
focusing on Christ and on the homeland He is preparing for us. What
will heaven be like? As our minds attempt to take in the reality, our
affections will be set on things above instead of on things of earth.
   Ellen White described what heaven is like. "I seemed to be there
where all was peace, where no stormy conflicts of earth could ever
come—heaven, a kingdom of righteousness where all the holy and
pure and blest are congregated, ten thousand times ten thousand and
thousands of thousands, living and walking in happy, pure intimacy,
praising God and the Lamb who sitteth on the throne.
   "Their voices were in perfect harmony. They never do each other
wrong. Princes of heaven, the potentates of this mighty realm, are
rivals only in good, seeking the happiness and joy of each other. The
greatest there is least in self-esteem, and the least is greatest in his
gratitude and wealth of love.
   "There are no dark errors to cloud the intellect. Truth and knowl-
edge, clear, strong, and perfect, have chased every doubt away, and no
gloom of doubt casts its baleful shadow upon its happy inhabitants.
No voices of contention mar the sweet and perfect peace of heaven. Its
inhabitants know no sorrow, no grief, no tears. All is in perfect
harmony, in perfect order and perfect bliss."—Last Day Events,
p. 296.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS
  I. How would you answer a person who asks, How can you
     believe that a God of love will destroy people?

   2. Because making ready to meet Jesus at His coming involves
      receiving the gift of His character, what daily adjustments
      in our lifestyles may be necessary?

SUMMARY: The coming of Jesus is the glorious hope of His church.
When Jesus comes the second time, He will resurrect the righteous
dead, translate all the righteous to heaven, and make an end of sin and
sinners. With His coming so near, we need the constant presence of
the Holy Spirit in our hearts. We must be ready to see Jesus.

Global Mission
                    Do Thirteenth Sabbath Offerings
                          Make a Difference?
                                    Sammy Lee


           The school already was filled to overflowing; it simply could
        not accommodate any more students, the registrar explained. But
        Sammy, son of a Pentecostal minister, wanted to attend Indone-
        sian Union College Academy.
            Disappointment was etched on his face as he left the registrar's
        office. As he walked out, he met the dean of men, who came from
        the same town as Sammy. The dean knew Sammy was not an
        Adventist, but when he learned of Sammy's desire to attend the
        Adventist school, he found a way to "squeeze one more sardine
        into an already fully packed tin of sardines," and Sammy was
        accepted into the school.
            The dean knew that soon a portion of the Thirteenth Sabbath
        Offering would help Indonesian Union College Academy enlarge
        its boys' dormitory, and he hoped that would allow many other
        young men such as Sammy to attend school.
            The dean's decision did change Sammy's life, and over the
        intervening years, has influenced the lives of hundreds of others
        along the way. Instead of bitterness over being rejected by the
        Adventist school, Sammy Lee became an Adventist. Then he
        became a minister and an evangelist in Indonesia and Malaysia.
            Nearly 1,000 people have been baptized into the Adventist
        church during evangelistic meetings Sammy Lee has conducted.
        Currently he pastors an English-speaking congregation in Macao,
        on China's border. On Sundays he often speaks at two Protestant
        churches in Macao. "Thousands of English-speaking people from
        Indonesia and Philippines live in Macao," he says with zeal. "The
        potential for evangelism is great."
            "I am an Adventist as a direct result of a Thirteenth Sabbath
        offering," he smiles. "If I had not been accepted into that school, I
        would have felt rejected and bitter. I certainly would not have
        considered becoming an Adventist. Our offerings do make a
        difference—a big difference."

          Besides pastoring the English congregation in Macao, Sammy
        Lee is chaplain at the Sam Yuk Adventist School, where an
        evangelistic center is planned because of a Thirteenth Sabbath
        Offering earlier this year.
