         God's Family, the Church
    The Christian church is the communion of all Jesus' believing
disciples, in whose hearts the Holy Spirit is reigning and who are
committed to sharing the everlasting gospel with their fellow human
beings. The church before the Cross was the communion of God's
called-out, Spirit-directed people who believed in the saving work of
the coming Messiah.
    "His church is the court of holy life, filled with varied gifts, and
endowed with the Holy Spirit. Appropriate duties are assigned by
Heaven to each member of the church on earth, and all are to find
their happiness in the happiness of those whom they help and bless."
—Our High Calling, p. 164.
    Throughout history Satan has struggled to destroy God's true
church. And at times he seems to have come close to achieving his
aim. But rising as a mighty shield between him and the church is the
promise of Christ, "Upon this rock I will build my church; and the
gates of hell shall not prevail against it" (Matt. 16:18). Christ also
promised, "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not
pass away" (Matt. 24:35).
    Going forth with these promises, the church conducts itself as the
bride of Christ. It is a Rebekah, who hastens to draw water from the
wells of salvation to refresh all thirsty strangers. It is a Ruth, who
presses close to the feet of her Lord, petitioning, "I am your
servant. . . . Spread the corner of your garment over me, since you are
a kinsman-redeemer" (Ruth 3:9, NIV).
    The church is a Deborah, who proclaims, "May they who love you
be like the sun when it rises in its strength" (Judg. 5:31, NIV). It is a
Hannah, who declares, "I rejoice in Your salvation. There is none
holy like the Lord . . . nor is there any rock like our God" (1 Sam. 2:1,
2, NKJV).
    The church is an Abigail, who intercedes for the cause of God and
with loving devotion accepts His call, urging, "Here is your maid-
servant, ready to serve you and wash the feet of my master's serv-
 ants" (1 Sam. 25:41, NIV). It is a Mary, who in response to the
 humanly impossible promise of God states in faith, "I am the Lord's
 servant. . . . May it be to me as you have said" (Luke 1:38, NIV). It is
 an Esther, pressing to the throne of grace and judgment, saying, "I
 will go to the king. . . . And if I perish, I perish" (Esther 4:16, NIV).
 Once there, her royal husband extends His scepter. She touches it,
 and overcome by His love, she also overcomes to sit with Him on His
 throne forever.
     We invite you to step forth in the light of these same promises and
 illustrations of faithfulness. Learn (1) why God established His fam-
 ily we call the church, (2) how He established it, (3) why the church
 will triumph, and (4) how you can participate in that triumph.

                                                                         5
Lesson 1                               September 29—October 5

     God's People, the Church




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Gen. 12:1-6; 15:18; 1 Cor.
3:9-17; 12:12-17; 2 Cor. 11:2; Eph. 3:14, 15.

     MEMORY TEXT: "He [Christ] is before all things, and in him
     all things hold together. And he is the head of the body, the
     church" (Colossians 1:17, 18, NIV).

     KEY QUESTION: What is the church?

   CHRIST LOVES HIS BRIDE. She was not stylish, and palace
etiquette was to her an unknown art. Nor did her occupation as a farm
girl mark her for any special honor. She spoke of being befriended by
the king. What vain delusions! they all thought. But the king really did
come to see this lowly Shulamite maiden. He brought her into his
banqueting house and showered her with love. Why did the king
choose her over polished society girls?
   The answer lay in the maid's deep capacity to appreciate her king's
love. His very name to her was as ointment poured forth, his fellow-
ship sweeter than the rarest perfume, his fruit delectable to her taste,
his voice more alluring than the songs of 10,000 suitors. Nothing
could satisfy the maiden besides the joy of his company.
   The king's friendship changed her looks and demeanor. No longer
drab, she now appeared all glorious within, radiant with the beauty of
holiness. Her garments were of no ordinary texture or weave. Fair as
the moon, clear as the sun, she bore a banner inscribed with a message
that made holy those who read it and believed.
   The story is told in the Song of Solomon. It can be viewed as an
allegory of Christ's love for His bride, the church. This week's lesson
introduces us to that beautiful relationship.

Sunday                                          September 29
WE ARE HIS PEOPLE, PART 1 (Gen. 12:1-6).

   One of the story lines in the Bible consists of God's search for and
establishment of a people who would respond to Him in faith and
obedience. Such women, men, and children are the church.
   In the Old Testament (KJV), three words refer to the gathering of
God's people. Translated from the Hebrew, these words are assembly
(Num. 20:6; Deut. 9:10), congregation (Lev. 4:21; Joel 2:16, NKJV),
and people (Deut. 7:6; 2 Kings 11:17).

   The possessive pronoun My, referring to God, is often used with
the word people. For example, read Exodus 3:7, Leviticus 26:12,
and Jeremiah 31:33. What does this tell us about the connection
between our relationship with God and our affiliation with the
rest of His people?


   In the Old Testament, upon what factors is this community of
believers based?

Gen. 12:1-6; 15:6


Gen. 15:18; 17:1, 2


Gen. 17:11


Exod. 19:6; Lev. 19:2


Exod. 23:22; Deut. 30:15, 16

   God first established a formal community of believers upon His
election of Abraham and his descendants, an election legislated by the
terms of a covenant or agreement and confirmed by the sign of cir-
cumcision. Being a member of the community meant being set apart
by God and living by the terms of the covenant.

    Abraham's response to God's call was essential in making out
 of him a people who would respond to God in faith and obedi-
 ence. Why is this type of response just as essential today? Think
 carefully about your life as you are presently living it. How have
 you been responding to God?

                                                                     7
Monday                                         September 30
WE ARE HIS PEOPLE, PART 2 (Gen. 12:1-3).

   Sunday we studied the elements upon which the community of
God's people in the Old Testament is based. Take time now to review
those elements.

   Below are additional elements upon which the community of
God's people is based. Match each of the following texts to its
proper element: (a) Isa. 58:6-8; Micah 6:8; (b) Judg. 1:1, 2;
1 Sam. 16:1, 13; (c) Gen. 12:1-3; Isa. 56:7; (d) Deut. 4:14;
(e) Exod. 25:8; 1 Chron. 16:29.

        God's community was to be an inclusive community.
        God Himself would instruct His community through His
        Law. He would teach them His will for their lives.
        They were to be merciful, as God is merciful.
        They were to be generous and avoid oppression.
        God would guide them through leaders He would ap-
        point.
        God's people were to worship Him. Through the sanctu-
        ary services, they were to learn about His solution to the
        sin problem.

   Why is worship such an important element upon which to base
God's church? Are the elements we studied yesterday and today
all equally important to the church today? Explain.


   "The duty to worship God is based upon the fact that He is the
Creator, and that to Him all other beings owe their existence. And
wherever, in the Bible, His claim to reverence and worship, above the
gods of the heathen, is presented, there is cited the evidence of His
creative power. . . . '0 come, let us worship and bow down: let us
kneel before the Lord our Maker.' "—The Great Controversy,
pp. 436, 437.
   Exod. 25:8. "The sanctuary provided a visible center for the wor-
ship of the one true God, and was thus a bulwark against the worship
of the many gods of the heathen. It brought God near to His people
and made His presence among them real. This too was a protection
against idolatry."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 635.

   How do today's visible centers of worship bring God close to
you? How do other defenses against modern idolatry help us wor-
ship God? How can worshiping your Creator improve your life?

PROMISED TO CHRIST (2 Cor. 11:2).

   Even though the Hebrews accepted God's call to be His people,
they gradually and permanently became saturated with idolatry, pride,
isolationism, and selfishness. Jesus' death signaled the end of their
mission (Matt. 23:37-39), but not the end of the mission itself. After
Jesus' resurrection, the Christian church received the assignment (Matt.
21:43; Gal. 3:28, 29).
   New Testament descriptions of the church enlarge our understand-
ing of what it means to be God's people involved in this mission.

   How do 2 Corinthians 11:2, Ephesians 5:25, and Revelation
19:7, 8 describe the church? (Also review the Introduction to the
lesson quarterly.)


   The Old Testament describes Israel as God's bride:
   • "For your Maker is your husband" (Isa. 54:5, NIV).
   • "As a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so will your God
      rejoice over you" (Isa. 62:5, NIV).
   • "I will betroth you to me forever; I will betroth you in right-
      eousness and justice, in love and compassion. I will betroth you
      in faithfulness" (Hosea 2:19, 20, NIV).
   • "I am married unto you" (Jer. 3:14).

   Perhaps with these texts in mind, it was natural for Paul to think of
the church as Christ's bride.
   "At a Jewish wedding there were two people called the friends of
the bridegroom, one representing the bridegroom and one the
bride. . . . They acted as liaisons between the bride and the bride-
groom; they carried the invitations to the guests; but they had one
particular responsibility, that of guaranteeing the chastity of the bride.
That is what is in Paul's thought here. In the marriage of Jesus Christ
and the Corinthian Church he is the friend of the bridegroom. It is his
responsibility to guarantee the chastity of the bride, and he will do all
he can to keep the Corinthian Church pure and a fit bride for Jesus
Christ."—William Barclay, The Letters to the Corinthians, rev. ed.
(Philadelphia, Pa: Westminster Press, 1975), p. 246.

  How does the church, as the bride of Christ, protect its purity?
Eph. 5:25-27; John 17:17.


    What improvements could you make in your Bible study to
 help you maintain purity in your marriage to Christ?

                                                                       9

      MANY PARTS, ONE BODY (1 Cor. 12:12-27).

  Why is Paul's description of God's people as a human body so
appropriate? 1 Cor. 12:12-27.


   Consider how all the various parts of the body are to function
as a unit. How should we, the various parts of the church body,
function as a whole? Below we have suggested some possibilities.
What others can you think of?


   1. As members of the church body, we need one another. Many
times, individual members become so involved in what they are doing
that they believe their work is the most important. If the church is to
be healthy, we must understand that everyone is needed.
   2. We also need to respect one another. The left leg is not more
important than the right leg. The body cannot function without the
heart. Neither can it function without the liver. Likewise, each church
member is equally necessary.
   3. If a part of the human body suffers, the rest of the body suffers
with it. As members of the church body, we must sympathize with
other members who are suffering, for whatever reason.

   "Radio newsman Charles Osgood told the story of two ladies who
lived in a convalescent center. Each had suffered an incapacitating
stroke. Margaret's stroke left her left side restricted, while Ruth's
stroke damaged her right side. Both of these ladies were accomplished
pianists but had given up hope of ever playing again.
   "The director of the center sat them down at a piano and encour-
aged them to play solo pieces together. They did, and a beautiful
friendship developed.
   "What a picture of the church's needing to work together! What
one member cannot do alone, perhaps two or more could do
together—in harmony ."—Larson, Illustrations for Preaching and Teach-
ing, p. 41.
   The role of the Holy Spirit. Harmony is attained when individu-
ally we are regenerated by the Holy Spirit. Then our words and deeds
will be directed by the growth of the Spirit's fruit in our lives (John
3:3, 5; Gal. 5:22-25).

  As what part of the church body do you see yourself? A hand?
An arm? An ear? Other? Why do you see yourself in that role?
What can you do to improve the work you do?

WHERE PEOPLE ARE LOVED (Eph. 3:14, 15).

  To what does Ephesians 3:14, 15 compare those who respond to
God in faith and obedience?


   To discover what else the Bible tells us about the church as family,
match the following texts to the corresponding characteristic of church
as family below: (a) Eph. 1:4-6; John 3:8; (b) Gal. 3:26-4:7; (c) Gal.
4:6; (d) James 2:15.

         Members of God's family call Him Father.
         We join God's family through adoption and the new birth.
         Members of God's family relate to one another as brothers
         and sisters.
         As members of God's family, we are His children.

   A nurturing environment. The metaphor of church as family
describes an environment "where people are loved, respected, and
recognized as somebody. A place where people acknowledge that they
need each other. Where talents are developed. Where people grow.
Where everybody is fulfilled."—Charles E. Bradford, "What the Church
Means to Me," Adventist Review, Nov. 20, 1986, p. 15.
   The church as family "also implies accountability, a respect for
spiritual parents, a watching out for spiritual brothers and sisters. And
finally, it means that each member will have toward each other mem-
ber a love that engenders a deep loyalty that undergirds and
strengthens."—Seventh-day Adventists Believe, p. 140.

   Fellowship is a distinctive feature of the church as family.
Christian fellowship not only includes socialization with fellow be-
lievers, but a unique association with God the Father, Jesus, and the
Holy Spirit (1 John 1:3; 1 Cor. 1:9). In 1 John 1:3, the Greek word for
fellowship suggests mutual sharing between equal partners (such as
believers), as well as between unequal partners (such as God and a
believer). The idea of fellowship is a major theme of this chapter. If
we truly know Christ, we "will always want others to share in that
blessed companionship."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 629.

     A newly baptized member of a local congregation grew up in
 a rather dysfunctional family. The concept of church as family
 is, therefore, meaningless to him. How can the more experienced
 members help him to understand this idea? What can they do to
 give him the sense of belonging to a family?


                                                                      11
Friday                                                  October 4
FURTHER STUDY: This week we have been learning about the
biblical meaning of church. Part of our study included the New Testa-
ment descriptions of the church as a body, a bride, and a family. The
New Testament also describes the church as a temple. Read 1 Corinthians
3:9-17; 2 Corinthians 6:14-16; Ephesians 2:13-22; 1 Peter 2:4-6. Also
read The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 595-599.

   " 'Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every
man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor. For we
are laborers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's
building.' 1 Cor. 3:8, 9. In this scripture the apostle compares the
church to a cultivated field, in which the husbandmen labor, caring for
the vines of the Lord's planting; and also to a building, which is to
grow into a holy temple for the Lord. God is the master worker, and
He has appointed to each man his work. All are to labor under His
supervision, letting Him work for and through His workmen. He gives
them tact and skill, and if they heed His instruction, crowns their
efforts with success. . . .
   "Each one has an individuality of his own, which he is not to sink in
that of any other man. Yet each is to work in harmony with his
brethren. In their service, God's workers are to be essentially one. No
one is to set himself up as a criterion, speaking disrespectfully of his
fellow-workers, or treating them as inferior. Under God, each is to do
his appointed work, respected, loved, and encouraged by the other
laborers. Together they are to carry the work forward to comple-
tion."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 275, 276.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How would you answer the Key Question in Sabbath
     Afternoon's lesson, "What is the church?"

   2. What modern comparisons could you use to describe the
      church?

   3. In Sunday's and Monday's lessons, we studied elements
      upon which the Old Testament church was based. Why are
      these elements crucial for today's church?

SUMMARY: The church is worthy of God's blessing only as we
respond to Him in faith and obedience. As His bride, we maintain our
faithfulness to Him, working together as a unified body, a closely knit
family, sharing His mercy and salvation with the world.

Global Mission

                 God Squads Storm the Cape Verde Islands
                                    Edwin Eisele

           The Cape Verde Islands, 500 miles off the coast of West Africa,
        are the product of volcanic eruptions. Similarly, recent political and
        religious eruptions among the islands' 400,000 inhabitants have
        opened hearts and minds to the gospel.
           The official church has warned its members to stay away from
        Christian churches and evangelistic meetings. So the Holy Spirit
        inspired Adventist youth to take the gospel to the multitudes in the
        open markets and public squares—any place where crowds gather.
        And the people are flocking to hear the gospel.
           Armed with their Bibles, accordions, guitars, and megaphones,
        these youthful "God squads" enter villages that have no Adventist
        Church, and invite villagers to a gospel concert. They sing praise
        songs until a crowd gathers, then the leader opens his Bible and
        declares the saving grace of Christ.
           The leaders of the official church have tried to stop these im-
        promptu religious services, but the crowds—including police and
        city officials—enjoy the music. Instead of stopping the young people,
        the officials come to listen.
            Pray for the youth—and all believers—of the Cape Verde Islands
        and the 10 other countries of the Sahel Union in West Africa as they
        proclaim the gospel to willing listeners.
            In nearly all 11 nations of the Sahel Union Mission, the doors of
        opportunity are open as never before. From the southern Sahara
        Desert to the Atlantic coast of Cote d'Ivore, pioneer missionary
        work is producing dramatic growth of 10 to 15 percent each year.
            But the work is far from finished. Adventist memberships are
        small, particularly in the Muslim nations of the Sahel Mission. Niger
        has only 35 members; Mali has 250; Senegal has 125; and Mauritania
        has no Adventist presence.
            Thank you for your prayers and support through the Sabbath
                                    School mission offerings that will enable
                                    us to brighten every unentered region of
                                    our vast territory with the everlasting
                                    gospel.

      God's Called-Out People




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Gen. 12:1-6; Acts 7:1-8;
Gal. 3:6-9, 29; Heb. 11:9-12.

   MEMORY TEXT: "I will make you a great nation; I will bless
   you and make your name great; and you shall be a blessing"
   (Genesis 12:2, NKJV).

   KEY QUESTION: How did the church begin?

   THE FAITH OF ABRAHAM IS TO BE OUR FAITH. God
searched for and established a people who would respond to Him in
faith and obedience. Abraham is presented in Scripture as a type of
God's faithful people. As the forefather of Israel, God's chosen nation
and church, Abraham's experience exemplifies the family tie God
wishes to have with His children.
   Abraham was born in ancient Babylon (Ur), a country steeped in
idolatry and sin. Even though his parents partially yielded to the pagan
influences surrounding them, Abraham longed for a pure experience,
a genuine connection with God. "Faithful among the faithless, uncorrupted
by the prevailing apostasy, he steadfastly adhered to the worship of
the one true God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 125. Thus God was
able to reveal to Abraham "a distinct knowledge of the requirements
of His law and of the salvation that would be accomplished through
Christ."—p. 125.
   The Lord led Abraham out of his native land, away from the pagan
influences of Ur of the Chaldees, so he would be free to develop
spiritual strength without interference. We may learn from Abraham's
experience how to give the claims and call of God first place without
being callous or unkind toward family members or society in general.

Sunday                                                 October 6
THE CALL OF ABRAHAM (Gen. 12:1-5).

  Why did God call Abraham out of his home in Ur? Gen. 12:2, 3;
17:4-8.


   "In order that God might qualify him for his great work as the
keeper of the sacred oracles, Abraham must be separated from the
associations of his early life. . . . Now that Abraham was, in a special
sense, connected with heaven, he must dwell among strangers. His
character must be peculiar, differing from all the world. . . .
   "Relying upon the divine promise . . . he abandoned home and
kindred and native land, and went forth, he knew not whither, to
follow where God should lead."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 126.
    In Genesis 14:13, Abraham is called a Hebrew. A Hebrew is one
who has passed over from the other side, especially one who has come
from east of Canaan, beyond the Euphrates. (See SDA Bible Dic-
tionary, p. 468.) By implication, this signifies one who has come out
of Babylon. It was not Abraham's national origin.that made him great,
but his pure worship of the true God.

   Who are called by God? Isa. 45:22; Matt. 11:28, 29.


   Wanting none to be lost, God calls everyone to be saved (2 Peter
3:9). But only those "who are with Him are called, chosen, and faith-
ful" (Rev. 17:14, NKJV). The "called" are, ultimately, those who
respond to Christ's universal plea to let Him be their Saviour and thus
receive His righteousness by faith (Rom. 9:7, 8). For this reason Christ
said, "Many are called, but few are chosen" (Matt. 22:14).
   Giving God your all. At the age of 30, Florence Nightingale, the
famous nurse of the Crimean War, wrote, "I am thirty years of age, the
age at which Christ began His mission. Now no more childish things,
no more vain things. Now, Lord, let me think only of Thy will." Near
the end of her days, when someone asked for her life's secret, she
replied, "I can only give one explanation. That is, I have kept nothing
back from God."—Paul Rees, Encyclopedia of 7,700 Illustrations,
Paul Lee Tan, ed. (Rockville, Md.: Assurance Pub., 1985), p. 271;
adapted.

     Like Abraham, Florence Nightingale responded positively to
 Christ's call. What changes can such a response produce in your
 life?



                                                                    15

GOD'S COVENANT WITH ABRAHAM (Gen. 15:1-18; 17:1-14).

   At the heart of God's covenant with Abraham was a revelation of
the Messiah's sacrifice for the sins of the world. (Compare Heb. 9:
13-15.)

  On what basis did God count Abraham righteous? Gen. 15:6;
Rom. 4:1-3.


    As "the father of all those who believe" (Rom. 4:11, NKJV),
Abraham received God's righteousness. Complete trust in God is the
power behind the religious experience of the church and each believer.
God's true followers are those who base their entire understanding of
life on His teachings (John 14:21-23). They recognize that by His
word He created, upholds, and orders all things (Heb. 1:1-3).
    With Christ as your Saviour. The Lord bestowed righteousness
upon Abraham before his circumcision (Gen. 15:3-6; Rom. 4:8-16)
because "faith is the condition upon which God has seen fit to promise
pardon to sinners. . . . When the sinner believes that Christ is his
personal Saviour, then according to His unfailing promises, God par-
dons his sin and justifies him freely. The repentant soul realizes that
his justification comes because Christ, as his substitute and surety, has
died for him, is his atonement and righteousness."—Ellen G. White
Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1073.
    Faith is the means of salvation for all, whether Jew or Gentile,
circumcised or uncircumcised. In Abraham's day, circumcision was
the token of the covenant, not its substance. Since Calvary, baptism
has replaced circumcision as the token of Christ's covenant with us
(Col. 2:10-13).

  What is the significance of God's changing Abram's name to
Abraham? Gen. 17:4, 5.


   The change of Abram's name, meaning "exalted father," to Abraham,
"a father of nations or multitudes," indicates the worldwide blessing
God would bestow through him and his descendants.

   When we accept Christ, we also receive a new name—that of
 Christian. This new name indicates the blessing God desires to
 work through us. Of what does this blessing consist? How can
 you be a blessing to your family, friends, and acquaintances?

THE FAITH OF ABRAHAM (Heb. 11:8-10).

   What practical evidences do we find in Abraham's life illus-
trating that he was a man of great faith? Gen. 12:1-5; 18:20-33;
22:1-14.


   "It was no light test that was thus brought upon Abraham, no small
sacrifice that was required of him. There were strong ties to bind him
to his country, his kindred, and his home. But he did not hesitate to
obey the call. . . .
   "Many are still tested as was Abraham. They do not hear the voice
of God speaking directly from the heavens, but He calls them by the
teachings of His word and the events of His providence. . . . Who is
ready at the call of Providence to renounce cherished plans and famil-
iar associations? Who will accept new duties and enter untried fields,
doing God's work with firm and willing heart, for Christ's sake
counting his losses gain?"—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 126, 127.
    Paul says that Abraham was "not weak in faith" and "staggered not
at the promise of God through unbelief" (Rom. 4:19, 20). But Genesis
shows that Abraham, in a moment of weakness, laughed at the idea of
having a son by Sarah, because she was well past the childbearing
years. How are we to harmonize these scriptures? First, Abraham's
faith was habitually strong and progressive, in spite of several lapses.
Abraham's ultimate experience was not one of defeat, but of victory in
Christ. This reveals God's great love for His children. He does not
judge us by our formative struggles and past failures, but by our
ultimate decisions in response to His work of grace.

  What was the "secret" of Abraham's faith? Gal. 3:6, 8; Heb.
11:8-10.


  Genesis 15 gives an expanded account of God's covenant with
Abraham. "The plan of redemption was here opened to him, in the
death of Christ, the great sacrifice, and His coming in glory. Abraham
saw also the earth restored to its Eden beauty, to be given him for an
everlasting possession, as the final and complete fulfillment of the
promise."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 137.

    What can you learn from Abraham's life that will help to
 strengthen your faith? How does our faith grow? Is it God's gift
 or our achievement? If our faith grows as we exercise it, does
 that imply that greater faith is our achievement?


                                                                     17
Wednesday                                              October 9
THE OBEDIENCE OF ABRAHAM (James 2:14-26).

   Abraham is widely known for his faith in God. What do the
following texts teach regarding other qualities that Abraham pos-
sessed? Gen. 18:19; 26:4, 5.


   Abraham knew that we are not saved by works, but by God's mercy
and power. However, this insight did not counteract his willingness to
obey God. Instead, it inspired him to do all that the Lord required of
him. He did not suppose that his willing obedience took the place of
faith or that it earned him any merit with God. It was his delight to do
the will of the Lord, because he recognized the blessedness of the
divine will, and he appropriated the grace of God that enabled him to
carry out His will.

    What lessons does James draw from the life of Abraham to
illustrate the qualities of true faith? James 2:14-24.


   "Abraham's test was the most severe that could come to a human
being. Had he failed under it, he would never have been registered as
the father of the faithful. Had he deviated from God's command, the
world would have lost an inspiring example of unquestioning faith
and obedience."—Youth's Instructor, June 6, 1901.
   Faith and obedience are linked as closely as fire and heat. Obedi-
ence is a natural result of faith.
   Rowing with both oars. An elderly Scotsman once operated a
small rowboat ferry. One day a passenger noticed that the man had
carved on one oar the word Faith and on the other the word Works.
When the passenger inquired about this, the Scotsman, a Christian,
proceeded to demonstrate. When he rowed with only the oar labeled
Works, the boat went around in circles. When he rowed with only the
oar labeled Faith, the boat went around in circles in the opposite
direction. He ended his demonstration with this thought, "Faith and
works pulling together make for safety, progress, and blessing."
—Encyclopedia of 7,700 illustrations, p. 403; adapted.

  What did God call Abraham? Isa. 41:8. To whom else does He
apply the same designation? John 15:14.


   How do Abraham's faith and obedience correlate with the de-
scription of the saved in Revelation 14:12?

THE DESCENDANTS OF ABRAHAM (Gal. 3:7-9).

   Students of Scripture know that while the Israelites prided them-
selves on their descent from Abraham, descent is never the guarantee
of salvation. Yet the Lord frequently reminded the Jews that they were
the literal descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (Exod. 3:15; 6:
2-4; Num. 32:11; Mark 12:26). This was not to encourage pride in
their national origins, but to help them remember His perpetual cov-
enant that would make them a distinctive people, called to reveal His
righteousness to the world (1 Chron. 16:13-15, 24).

  Who are the true children of Abraham? Gal. 3:7-9, 29 (com-
pare Rom. 2:28, 29; Phil. 3:3).


   These verses reveal the significance of God's promise to make
Abraham a blessing to all the families of earth. God points out the
spiritual influence of Abraham's example, an influence whose vast-
ness and depth have been immortalized by the Spirit, not only through
the record of Scripture, but through the moral influence of Abraham's
godly life. Thus, the light of one incorruptible life illuminates the
ages.
   True descendants. "Christ recognized no virtue in lineage. He taught
that spiritual connection supersedes all natural connection. The Jews
claimed to have descended from Abraham; but by failing to do the
works of Abraham, they proved that they were not his true children.
Only those who prove themselves to be spiritually in harmony with
Abraham by obeying the voice of God, are reckoned as of true de-
scent."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 268.

   God wanted Abraham and his descendants to spread His truth
around the world. As we can see from Galatians 3, this work is
now transferred to all believers. How does Ephesians 3:6, 14, 15
refer to these believers?


   "Today, as never before, the dissemination of Bible truth by means
of a consecrated church is bringing to the sons of men the benefits
foreshadowed centuries ago in the promise to Abraham and to all
Israel—to God's church on earth in every age-1 will bless thee . . .
and thou shalt be a blessing.' Gen. 12:2."—Prophets and Kings,
p. 703.

    How can you help spread Bible truth so that you will be a
 blessing to those with whom you come in contact?

                                                                    19

FURTHER STUDY: Abraham's consecration and faith qualified him
to be the spiritual forefather of the faithful in all ages to come.
Scripture repeatedly presents his example as worthy of following
because he lived with a conscientious desire to glorify God. One of
Abraham's distinguishing characteristics was that he taught and spir-
itually guided his entire household (Gen. 18:19). His own reverence
for God was a convincing example to them.

    Furthermore, he was a missionary for Christ to unbelievers. "Wher-
ever he pitched his tent, he set up beside it the altar for sacrifice and
worship. When the tent was removed, the altar remained; and many a
roving Canaanite, whose knowledge of God had been gained from the
life of Abraham His servant, tarried at that altar to offer sacrifice to
Jehovah."—Education, p. 187.
    Read "Abraham in Canaan" and "The Test of Faith" in Patriarchs
and Prophets, pp. 132-155. Compare Romans 4 with Galatians 3 and 4
and James 2.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. After studying this week's lesson, how would you answer
     the Key Question in Sabbath Afternoon's lesson, "How did
     the church begin"?

   2. When disagreement broke out between Lot's household and
      Abraham's, Abraham said, "Please let there be no strife
      between you and me . . . for we are brethren" (Gen. 13:8,
      NKJV). What can we learn as a church from this spirit of
      love and conciliation?

   3. What can we learn about our mission from Abraham's
      coming to the rescue of Lot and the captured people of
      Sodom and Gomorrah? Compare Genesis 14 with Revela-
      tion 18.

   4. How does the influence of a well-ordered Christian house-
      hold affect the world and the church?

SUMMARY: Abraham's faith was based on his personal knowledge
of God and on love for Him. He obeyed God by faith and guided his
household into a pure and godly way of life. Women, men, and
children who are part of God's household, His true church, will through
faith partake of the same virtues Abraham possessed and will exert the
same influence for good on others that he did.

                       Discovering Peace In Jesus
                             James Zachary
           Rosyen was a beautiful girl from a well-known, affluent family.
       The young man who came courting had become a Muslim in order
       to marry her. On their wedding day her father provided the newly-
       weds with a large home.
           One day Rosyen discovered her new husband reading from the
       Bible. "Let me read that book," she begged. "I would like to know
       what it says." Her husband warned her what could happen if the
       Bible was discovered, and Rosyen promised to be discreet.
           As Rosyen read the Word of God, the Holy Spirit touched her
       heart. She was deeply impressed by the story of Jesus' death on the
       cross. As she thought about what she had read, she began to feel a
       peace and a hungering that she had never known before. She spent
       more time with the Bible. Her heart was flooded with joy as she
       directed her thoughts to Jesus.
           "I want to become a Christian," she told her husband one day.
           "I don't understand," he said. "I became a Muslim so 1 could
       marry you, and now you want to become a Christian?" Rosyen told
       her husband about what had happened as she read the Bible.
           Rosyen's father discovered that she wanted to become a Chris-
       tian. Angrily he threw the couple out of their new house. They had
       to move into a cramped apartment. But Rosyen and her husband
       stood fast for Jesus. "I would rather live in my tiny apartment and
        have my heart filled with the peace of Jesus than to live in a
        mansion with an empty heart," Rosyen testified. Rosyen and five
        other Muslims asked for baptism following evangelistic meetings
        held in her city in Indonesia.
           Her brother, curious about what his sister was discovering in
        the Bible, borrowed her Bible. Because of his father's anger over
        Rosyen's conversion, her brother had to hide the Bible and read it
        secretly. Then one day his father discovered his son with the Bible.
       "If I see you reading that book again, I will kill you." Her brother
        is careful to conceal his Bible reading, and has started attending
        church. He dresses as if he were going swimming, but takes his
        dress clothes along and goes to church instead.
            Many Muslims yearn for a closer walk with God. And God is
        working on their hearts. Pray for them as they look for opportuni-
        ties to come to know more about the Christian faith.

                 The Church
               Before the Cross




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Exod. 25:1-9, 21, 22; Isa.
56:1-8; Heb. 8:1-13.

   MEMORY TEXT: "You led Your people like a flock by the
   hand of Moses and Aaron" (Psalm 77:20, NKJV).

 KEY QUESTIONS: Why did Israel not fully succeed as a church?
What lessons does Israel's history have for us as the church of today?

   GOD'S COVENANT IS EVERLASTING. Since the day our first
parents fell in the Garden of Eden (Gen. 3:15), God has sought to
restore the connection between Himself and humanity. The revelation
of His covenant of mercy is as ancient as sin, which called forth the
exercise of His forgiveness, grace, and restorative power. Since the
beginning of time, all who have received His covenant have done so
by faith (Heb. 11:4-8).
   The Lord raised up a special people, whom He organized into the
nation Israel. Their lives were to be guided by the principles of grace,
thus enabling them to receive the blessings of His salvation and to
show the world the benefits of obedient faith. God chose Moses as the
earthly deliverer and shepherd of Israel. And to him He committed a
body of laws—moral, civil, physical, and ceremonial—that were to
guide the Hebrews to knowledge of the Saviour. Under Moses' leader-
ship, Israel was identified as "the church in the wilderness" (Acts
7:38). When as a people they rejected Christ, the Israelites rejected
their role as light bearers to the world. Christ transferred that honor to
His church, composed of believers from every nation (Matt. 21:43).

GOD'S EVERLASTING COVENANT (Exod. 24:3-8; Ps. 89:34).

   "Adam and Eve, at their creation, had a knowledge of the law of
God; they were acquainted with its claims upon them; its precepts
were written upon their hearts. When man fell by transgression, the
law was not changed, but a remedial system was established to bring
him back to obedience. The promise of a Saviour was given, and
sacrificial offerings pointing forward to the death of Christ as the great
sin offering were established."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
p. 363.

   What does God say about His covenant? Ps. 89:34. God speaks
of two covenants. What was the first covenant? What was the
second covenant? Exod. 24:3-8; Heb. 8:6-13; 10:4, 10.


    God has always offered humankind the same covenantal
terms—grace through faith in the merits of a crucified and risen
Saviour (Gal. 3:16, 17). At every stage in history, God has offered
grace to obey His requirements. God has always offered the terms of
this everlasting or new covenant. By their faulty responses, humans
have failed to receive God's grace and have fallen short of covenant
fellowship with Him. The result has been.the "old covenant," based on
faulty human responses. God gave_the ceremonial system as an imper-
fect means of leading humanity to faith in the Messiah to come. Thus
the "old covenant" was something bad (humanity's faulty response to
God—Gal. 4:22-31) and something good (God's gift of the ceremo-
nial law—Heb. 9:1). Israel's own efforts to obey, without partaking of
God's grace and power, nullified for them the experience of the
everlasting (new) covenant (Rom. 9:31-33).
    "If man had kept the law of God, as given to Adam after his fall,
preserved by Noah, and observed by Abraham, there would have been
no necessity for the ordinance of circumcision. And if the descendants
of Abraham had kept the covenant, of which circumcision was a sign,
they would never have been seduced into idolatry, nor would it have
been necessary for them to suffer a life of bondage in Egypt; they
would have kept God's law in mind, and there would have been no
necessity for it to be proclaimed from Sinai or engraved upon tables of
stone."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 364. Nor would there have been
any need for the ceremonial law. Paul repudiated legalistic human
responses and the ceremonial law as binding after the Cross.

   Are you living in the liberating power of the new covenant? If
 not, why not give your heart to Jesus now? What practical
 benefits are provided by this new-covenant relationship?

                                                                      23

THE SANCTUARY AND THE COVENANT (Exod. 25:8).

    At the heart of God's covenant is His desire to restore His relation-
ship with humanity. Sin has separated us from God. But God's cov-
enant provides a way to bridge that gulf. The covenant removes sin
and brings into our hearts the everlasting righteousness of Christ
(1 John 3:5; Rom. 3:21, 22). And the method of doing so was revealed
in the sanctuary (Ps. 77:13).

   Give two reasons why God asked the Israelites, His church in
the wilderness, to build the sanctuary. Exod. 25:8; 29:43-46.


    Hebrews 8 and 9 explain in detail that God's purpose in establish-
ing the sanctuary was to reveal the plan of salvation, with a special
emphasis on the atoning sacrifice of Christ as the means of pardon,
purification, and reunion with God. The sanctuary was the ordained
center of worship and spiritual instruction. But the Israelites were not
to idolize it. The Lord wished to dwell among and in His people. Their
hearts were to be His sanctuary, the living repository of His covenant
(Lev. 26:11, 12; 2 Cor. 6:16-18; Heb. 10:14-17).

  Describe how the Israelites responded to the call for materials
and help in building the wilderness sanctuary. Exod. 35:4-10, 20-
29; 36:5, 6.


   "The murmurings of the Israelites and the visitations of God's
judgments because of their sins are recorded as a warning to after-
generations. And their devotion, their zeal and liberality, are an ex-
ample worthy of imitation. All who love the worship of God and prize
the blessing of His sacred presence will manifest the same spirit of
sacrifice in preparing a house where He may meet with them. They
will desire to bring to the Lord an offering of the very best that they
possess. A house built for God should not be left in debt, for He is
thereby dishonored. An amount sufficient to accomplish the work
should be freely given, that the workmen may be able to say, as did the
builders of the tabernacle, 'Bring no more offerings.' "
—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 344.

    Meditate on the relationship between Exodus 35:4-10, 20-29;
36:5, 6 and 1 Corinthians 3:9-16; 2 Corinthians 9:6-13. Where
 can we find the right sort of "building materials" for our char-
 acter development?

GOD'S UNIVERSAL PLAN THROUGH HIS SANCTUARY (Isa.
56:1-8).

   Jesus taught the woman at the well that "salvation is of the Jews"
(John 4:22). This did not mean that the Jewish people had the right to
determine who was to be saved, but that the Saviour would come as a
Jew. It also meant that to Israel as a people, God had committed the
knowledge of the Saviour and His salvation (Deut. 4:5, 6; Rom. 3:
1, 2).

  Specify two things the Jews were to do with the knowledge God
had given them. Deut. 30:15, 16; Isa. 49:6.



2.

   By demonstrating in their own lives the character and teachings of
Christ, Israel would be a kingdom of priests, whose wisdom and
spiritual purity would make them the religious educators of the world
(Exod. 19:6; Mal. 2:7). But because of their apostasy at Sinai, God
gave the priestly role to the Levites. Yet His objective for the nation
remained the same.

   What did the Lord show His people regarding the meaning of
the sanctuary service for those who were not native-born Jews?
Isa. 56:1-8.


   Had the Israelites remained faithful, people from all nations would
have come to worship God in the temple. But Israelite fascination with
other gods dimmed the lights of the sanctuary, making it difficult for
others to find their way.
   When fleeing from Saul, David took great comfort in his memories
of the sanctuary (Ps. 27:1-6; compare 43:3, 4; 63:1-4). From the
sanctuary services he had learned the way of salvation; an education
that would sustain him in the days ahead. "The Lord is my light and
my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life;
of whom shall I be afraid? When the wicked came against me to eat up
my flesh, my enemies and foes, they stumbled and fell. Though an
army should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear." "Wait on
the Lord; be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart" (Ps.
27:1-3, 14, NICTV).

     What does the sanctuary mean to you?

                                                                   25

ISRAEL REJECTS GOD'S CALL (Isa. 5:1-7).

   How did the Israelites, as a nation, respond to God's gracious
call? Isa. 1:2-6 (compare Isa. 5:1-7; Ezek. 16:14, 15).


   The Israelites failed to keep their covenant with God. Instead of
honoring Him before the world, they engaged in the idolatrous reli-
gions of other nations.

   Describe how God called His people back from their apostasy.
2 Chron. 36:14-16; Neh. 9:26-32.


   The Israelites lacked faith and love (John 5:42; Heb. 4:2). "They
forgot God, and lost sight of their high privilege as His representa-
tives. . . . All their advantages were appropriated for their own glorifi-
cation. They robbed God of the service He required of them, and they
robbed their fellow men of religious guidance and a holy example.
Like the inhabitants of the antediluvian world, they followed out
every imagination of their evil hearts. Thus they made sacred things
appear a farce, saying, `The-temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord
are these' (Jer. 7:4), while at the same time they were misrepresenting
God's character, dishonoring His name, and polluting His sanctu-
ary."—Christ 's Object Lessons, pp. 291, 292.

  What relevance does the history of Israel have for us as a
church today? 1 Cor. 10:1-15.


   Paul's warning to the Christians in Corinth not to depend on their
own strength and knowledge is valid for all Christians through the
ages. Israel's disobedience caused their ruin in the wilderness and
later brought about their captivity in Babylon (Jer. 17:23, 27).
   For Christians living in light of Christ's soon return, the counsel to
learn from Israel's wilderness ordeal is especially meaningful. Be-
cause of their love affair with the world (Numbers 25), many of the
Israelites died just before they would have completed their journey to
Canaan. We who have been entrusted with the gospel and knowledge
of the Second Coming should take care lest we perish in sin before
reaching the heavenly Canaan.

   Are there any attitudes, habits, or possessions in your life that
 might prevent you from answering God's call?

THE TRUE ISRAEL OF GOD (Rom. 2:28, 29).

   God's purpose did not change even though Israel failed to represent
His character to the world. He still has a people who constitute a "holy
nation" because they live the truth (1 Peter 2:9; Isa. 26:2). They are
God's true Israel.

  How did the Old Testament prophets characterize this "holy
nation"? Ps. 73:1; Isa. 63:8; Zeph. 3:13.


   Jacob, whose name means "supplanter" and "layer of snares,"
underwent a name change at the River Jabbok, when he wrestled with
the Angel. There God changed his name to Israel, which means "a
prince with God," "an overcomer with God" (Gen. 32:24-30). The
Angel said to Jacob, "For you have struggled with God and with men,
and have prevailed" (verse 28, NKJV). Jacob did not overcome God,
but was at last overcome by God's love and goodness. From a schemer
he became a man of trust, who relied upon God alone. If Jacob's
descendants continued to honor His covenant, God would bless them.

  What did Israel's rejection of their role as God's covenant-
keeping people lead Jesus, their King, to say? Matt. 21:42, 43;
23:37-39.


   Ingratitude, selfishness, pride, contempt for divine righteousness,
and hatred for the Messiah all combined to cause the ruin of ancient
Israel. Yet in Matthew 23, we read the most tender expression of love
toward Israel. "The time was at hand when God must reject the Jews
as His chosen people . . . yet how reluctantly Heaven abandoned them
to their own perverse way and to their tragic fate! For other statements
of Scripture expressing the mercy and longsuffering of God exercised
toward unrepentant sinners see Eze. 18:23, 31, 32; 33:11; 1 Tim. 2:4;
2 Peter 3:9."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 493.

   How does the New Testament identify the true followers of
Jesus? John 1:47; Rom. 2:28, 29; Phil. 3:9.


    The Angel touched Jacob on one of the strongest parts of the
 human body, indicating that God must "break" us down at the
 strongest part of our self before we are ready to be productive
 members of His church body. What part of you must God "break"
 in order for you to be such a member?

                                                                     27

FURTHER STUDY: Choose to read one or both of the following:
(1) Matthew 21:33-44; "The Lord's Vineyard" in Christ's Object Les-
sons, pp. 284-306; (2) Psalms 105, 106; "The Law and the Covenants"
in Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 363-373.

   "The church is very precious in God's sight. He values it, not for its
external advantages, but for the sincere piety which distinguishes it
from the world. He estimates it according to the growth of the mem-
bers in the knowledge of Christ, according to their progress in spir-
itual experience.
   "Christ hungers to receive from His vineyard the fruit of holiness
and unselfishness. He looks for the principles of love and good-
ness. . . . It is the atmosphere of grace which surrounds the soul of the
believer, the Holy Spirit working upon mind and heart, that makes him
a savor of life unto life, and enables God to bless his work."
—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 298.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Repentance, revival, and reformation were the three re-
     sponses that would have saved Israel from ruin. How can
     we advance these three "R's" of redemption without being
     harsh or divisive? How can we respond positively to salva-
     tion in Christ?

   2. Compare God's warning and appeal to Laodicea (Rev. 3:14-
      22) with His warnings and appeals to Israel (Jer. 3:12-22).

   3. How should we relate to God's prophetic warnings and
      counsels to the church? Should we condemn the church or
      repent individually and corporately?

SUMMARY: God gave His covenant of deliverance from sin through
the atonement of Christ to Adam and Eve the day they sinned. He
renewed His promise in the Abrahamic covenant. The "old" covenant
at Sinai was so named, not because of its age, but because the
Hebrews misunderstood it to mean "Obey in your own strength and
live," rather than "Obey by the grace that God provides." As a nation,
Israel was blind to the beauty and intent of the everlasting covenant—
a living union with God. God's true Israel, therefore, are the men,
women, and children in whose hearts dwell the new covenant and its
Giver (Heb. 8:10-12; Eph. 3:14-21).

                    Saved by Translation
                      Domingos da Silva, Jr.

   Domingos da Silva, Jr., enjoyed his work for a major television
dubbing company in Rio de Janeiro. He translated English-
language television programs into Portuguese so that the words fit
the speaker's mouth movements.
    But Domingos was uncomfortable when he saw the company he
worked for shun religious broadcasters who came for translation
services, favoring instead major television producers with large
budgets. As a Christian he wanted to help the religious program-
ers. He decided to open his own dubbing studio to serve religious
programers. When he told his supervisers of his plans, they begged
him to reconsider, but he had made up his mind. He purchased the
needed equipment and started his business in his own home.
    One of his first accounts was It Is Written. As he translated the
television programs, he was impressed with Pastor George
Vandeman's sermons and his honesty. And when he began trans-
lating the Bible course, he found that the lessons answered ques-
tions he had in his own religious life, questions that were not
answered in his own church. When he began to translate the Bible
study on Daniel, he saw Daniel's stand on health and his strong
faith in God. Da Silva exclaimed, "Daniel was an Adventist!"
    After working for It Is Written for a year, da Silva could resist
the message no longer. He picked up the telephone and called a
friend on the It Is Written team and told him "It is impossible to
resist this message. I want to be baptized."
    When a pastor began studying with da Silva, he found that
da Silva knew the lesson material—he had studied as he translated
 them.
    Da Silva's wife has supported his religious commitment,
although she has not yet been baptized. His young daughter loves
 Sabbath School. Since he has become an Adventist he says his life
                                has totally changed. His home is hap-
                                pier; he is happier. He thanks God
                                for leading him to change his ca-
                                reer. That decision has changed his
                                life.

              The Church Has
              One Foundation




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Cor. 3:11; Eph. 2:18-22;
1 Peter 2:6-8.

   MEMORY TEXT: "And I also say to you that you are Peter,
   and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades
   shall not prevail against it" (Matthew 16:18, NKJV).

   KEY QUESTIONS: How did Christ view the church? What posi-
tion did He give to it? Are the answers to these questions still relevant
to us today?

    CHRIST IS THE CREATOR, HEAD, AND SUSTAINER OF
HIS CHURCH. He desires that His people reveal His character and
the principles of His kingdom to the world.
    Christ founded the church upon Himself, the living Rock. He is the
foundation stone of which Isaiah and David spoke. "Thus says the
Lord God: Behold, I lay in Zion a stone for a foundation, a tried stone,
a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation" (Isa. 28:16, NKJV). "The
stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone"
(Ps. 118:22, NKJV). His Word, illuminated to our minds by His Spirit,
is the means by which He makes Himself known to us as our Saviour
(John 14:21-23). Therefore, His Word is the foundation of the true
church's beliefs. This places the authority of the church in the hands
of the One who gave both the Word and His life for our redemption.
     As head of the church, Christ equips His servants with gifts,
enabling them to reveal His truth to the world in order that all who
desire may become part of its fellowship. Thus the household of faith
is built up in love to include every believing man, woman, and child.

JESUS ESTABLISHES THE NEW TESTAMENT CHURCH
(Matt. 16:13-18).

   Matthew 16:13-17 records that Jesus asked His disciples what
others were saying about who He was. He wanted them to recognize
and openly affirm His identity, for only then could they have complete
faith in Him. Had Christ been no more than a teacher sent from God,
He could not have been anyone's Saviour, let alone the Saviour of the
entire world (1 John 2:1, 2).
   But Christ was God come to teach, to save, and to restore human-
kind through His atoning sacrifice. The disciples needed to know that
His authority was unquestionably supreme, especially in light of what
He and they were to suffer (Matt. 16:21-25).

  Upon what did Christ declare He was building His church?
What is the significance of the symbol? Matt. 16:18 (compare
Deut. 32:3, 4; 1 Cor. 3:10, 11; 10:1-4).


   As 1 Peter 2:6-8 reveals, Peter did not think of himself as the rock
on which the church was founded. Jesus is the divine Rock, giving a
sure and unshakable foundation to the church (Matt. 7:24, 25). And it
is upon this Rock that the church maintains its integrity and identity.
In a subordinate sense the collective testimony of all the apostles and
prophets constitutes the foundation of the church (Eph. 2:20-22), with
Jesus Christ Himself being the Chief Cornerstone. Their testimony is
foundational because it was the Spirit of Christ in them that inspired
their teachings (1 Peter 1:10, 11; 2 Peter 1:19-21).

   Why can the gates of hell not prevail against the church? Eph.
1:15-23; Rev. 1:10-18.


   The word hell comes from the Greek word hades, meaning "the
realm of the dead," "death," or "grave." Christ used the word to refer
to the dark, evil forces of the devil (Matt. 16:18).
   -For six thousand years, faith has builded upon Christ. For six
thousand years the floods and tempests of satanic wrath have beaten
upon the Rock of our salvation; but it stands unmoved."—The Desire
of Ages, p. 413.

 the "fort" remains secure against Satan's wily deceptions? How

CHRIST'S WORD IS FOUNDATIONAL (Matt. 7:24, 25).

   The foundation of a government is its laws. All policies and civil
functions of a nation are tested by its constitution. The same applies to
the church. The foundation of its government, the constitution of its
faith, is the Bible, God's Word. (See Isa. 40:8.)

   What did Christ say were the two criteria for building "on the
rock"? Matt. 7:24, 25.


   "The word of God is the only steadfast thing our world knows. It is
the sure foundation. 'Heaven and earth shall pass away,' said Jesus,
`but My words shall not pass away.' Matthew 24:35."—Thoughts
From the Mount of Blessing, p. 148.
   Jesus' words, the everlasting gospel, are to be the foundation, the
constitution, of each believer's character and life. Such character
building enables the church to witness for the truth because it is
character building empowered by Christ (1 Cor. 3:11).

  What did Jesus specify as a requirement of true discipleship?
John 8:31; Luke 8:21.


   This requirement can be met only if we are transformed by His
grace. Christ is the living Word (John 1:1-3, 14). He created and
upholds all things by His word. Therefore, we, the church, should
demonstrate the power of His word as it molds our lives with purpose,
principle, and truth.
   Are you a tourist or a traveler? Edward Hutton, English author of
travel books on Italy, was honored with the highest civilian award of
the Italian government—Commendatore of the Order of Merit of the
Republic. While describing the difference between the Italy of his first
studies and the Italy of the present, he commented that Italy then was
the land of travelers. But today it is the land of tourists who do not
understand what they see.
   This is a good illustration of how many Christians read their Bibles.
Instead of travelers, journeying slowly, absorbing the blessings and
exploring the depths, they are tourists who rush by at high speed, not
knowing what to read.—Donald Grey Barnhouse, Let Me Illustrate
(Grand Rapids, Mich.: Fleming H. Revell, 1967), p. 31; adapted.

HE IS THE HEAD; WE ARE THE BODY (Col. 1:18, 24).

   The imagery of Scripture regarding the church that we studied in
lesson 1 indicates that it is more a living organism than an organiza-
tion. This is not to suggest that the church lacks organization. What
combination of substances and functions could be more subtle, com-
plex, or sensitive than that of something alive? Truly the church is the
people whose hearts are filled with Christ.
   " 'The head of every man is Christ.' God, who put all things
under the Saviour's feet, 'gave Him to be the head over all things to
the church, which is His body, the fulness of Him that filleth all.'
1 Cor. 11:3; Eph. 1:22, 23. The church is built upon Christ as its
foundation; it is to obey Christ as its head. It is not to depend upon
man or be controlled by man."—The Desire of Ages, p. 414.

   Why is Christ called the head of the church? Through what
agency does Christ, the head, carry out His will? 1 Cor. 12:12, 27,
28.


   Christ's body, the church, is the living instrument through which
He ministers to the world. Paul emphasized the need for cooperation
among the diverse members of the body (1 Cor. 12:14-25). This
diversity, instead of being a cause for alarm or frustration, enables the
church to serve a world in need of physical, spiritual, and social help.
Sanctified unity in diversity results from the presence of the Holy
Spirit among us as a body of believers.

  What power or influence gives strength and allows the body to
grow? Eph. 4:11-16; John 13:34, 35.


    "The more closely we resemble our Saviour in character, the greater
will be our love toward those for whom He died. Christians who
manifest a spirit of unselfish love for one another are bearing a
testimony for Christ which unbelievers can neither gainsay nor resist.
It is impossible to estimate the power of such an example. Nothing
will so successfully defeat the devices of Satan and his emissaries,
nothing will so build up the Redeemer's kingdom, as will the love of
Christ manifested by the members of the church."—Testimonies, vol.
5, pp. 167, 168.

   How did Christ show love? How can you show love to those

THE PRICE HE PAID FOR THE CHURCH (Acts 20:28).

   The church is a divinely established society of believers. But God's
children are living on a planet that is hostile to the interests of the
divine kingdom represented by the church. Moreover, members of the
church have been ransomed from a life of rebellion against God and
from enslavement to the power of Satan.

   What ransom price did God pay to establish His church? Acts
20:28.


   The church is God's household (Eph. 2:19), whose work it is to
reveal the reconciling love of Christ to the world in godly doctrine and
godly deeds. By these means, all who are responsive to God's love
will be drawn into His family circle, the church.
   Throughout eternity, the ransomed church of God will never forget
the price He has paid for their redemption. The cross of Calvary will
constitute their science and song forever.

   Both redemption from sin and membership in God's family
while on this earth are precious blessings. What additional privi-
lege does the blood of Jesus open to those who receive Him? Heb.
10:19-23 (compare Heb. 4:14-16; 9:12-14).


   Through the blood of Christ, and by the Spirit's power, we have
spiritual access to the throne of grace in the Most Holy Place of the
heavenly sanctuary. There we may commune with God, receive in-
struction, and find mercy and grace for help in all times of need. The
value of this privilege is beyond words. We must personally have the
experience in order to appreciate it.
   "Keep your wants, your joys, your sorrows, your cares, and your
fears, before God. You cannot burden Him; you cannot weary Him.
He who numbers the hairs of your head is not indifferent to the wants
of His children. . . . Nothing that in any way concerns our peace is too
small for Him to notice. There is no chapter in our experience too dark
for Him to read; there is no perplexity too difficult for Him to un-
ravel."—Steps to Christ, p. 100.

   In view of the purchase price paid for our redemption, how
should you treat the gift of life that God has given you? Contem-
plate 1 Corinthians 6:19, 20 and 2 Corinthians 5:14-16. In view
of this purchase, how should you treat others, even those people
who are most difficult to love?

HIS COMMISSION AND GIFTS TO THE CHURCH (Matt. 28:
18-20).

   The church is more than just a group of people who sing, pray,
preach, and believe approximately the same things about Jesus. It is
"God's appointed agency for the salvation of men. It was organized
for service, and its mission is to carry the gospel to the world. From
the beginning it has been God's plan that through His church shall be
reflected to the world the fullness of His sufficiency. The members of
His church . . . are to show forth His glory."—The Acts of the Apostles,
p. 9.

   List the four parts of the commission Christ gave His disciples
just before He ascended to His Father in heaven. Matt. 28:18-20.
Why is each part not sufficient by itself?


    The work Jesus commanded His disciples to do they were not to do
on some seasonal or periodic basis, but continuously till the end of the
world. Thus, the commission is for us too. Our work will be effective
in proportion to the degree of our union with Him. A complete Saviour
revealed, a complete message unsealed, makes complete converts, of
all sin pardoned and healed, and in all truth fully sealed.

  The task of fulfilling Christ's commission in a world becoming
more and more corrupt is immense. But Christ has not left us
without help. When He ascended to heaven, what did He give the
church and why? Eph. 4:7-16.


   By exercising these gifts, the church reveals Christ's love to the
world. Through the gifts of the Spirit, which Christ's followers exer-
cise by divine grace and power, the world receives the invitation to be
reconciled to God through His Son (2 Cor. 5:17-21).
   " 'The Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say,
Come.' Rev. 22:17. Everyone who hears is to repeat the invitation.
Whatever one's calling in life, his first interest should be to win souls
for Christ. . . . Ministry does not consist alone in preaching. Those
minister who relieve the sick and suffering, helping the needy, speak-
ing words of comfort to the desponding and those of little faith."
—The Desire of Ages, p. 822.

   If you cherish supreme love for Christ and His purposes,
 what will God accomplish through you for the benefit of others?
 How can your love and devotion to Him be increased?

                                                                     35
Friday                                                October 25
FURTHER STUDY: As you read Revelation 1:10-20, consider the
intimate connection between Christ and His church. Also read "The
Foreshadowing of the Cross" and "Go Teach All Nations" in The
Desire of Ages, pp. 412-414, 818-828; "The Great Commission" in
The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 25-34.

   "To those who believe, Christ is a sure foundation. Upon this living
stone, Jews and Gentiles alike may build. It is broad enough for all and
strong enough to sustain the weight and burden of the whole world."—
The Acts of the Apostles, p. 175.
   "Human power and human might did not establ: the church of
God, and neither can they destroy it. Not on the rock of human
strength, but on Christ Jesus, the Rock of Ages, was the church
founded. . . . The presence of God gives stability to His cause. 'Put not
your trust in princes, nor in the son of man,' is the word that comes to
us. Psalm 146:3. 'In quietness and in confidence shall be your strength.'
Isaiah 30:15. God's glorious work, founded on the eternal principles
of right, will never come to nought. It will go on from strength to
strength, 'not by might, nor by power, but my Spirit, saith the Lord of
hosts.' Zechariah 4:6."—Prophets and Kings, pp. 595, 596.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How should knowing that Christ is the founder and head of
     the church affect your attitude toward being a part of the
     church?

   2. We have learned that Scripture refers to the church as the
      body of Christ as His bride (Eph. 5:23-32; Rev. 19:7, 8).
      Discuss the significance of these comparisons with respect
      to our privileges and responsibilities as members of His
      church.

   3. Compare your life and priorities with the following state-
      ment: "All who receive the life of Christ are ordained to
      work for the salvation of their fellow men. For this work the
      church was established, and all who take upon themselves
      its sacred vows are thereby pledged to be co-workers with
      Christ."—The Desire of Ages, p. 822.

SUMMARY: Christ established the church, with Himself as its foun-
dation. He intends that the church shall live in harmony with His
Word and teach its precepts to the world. The church is an extension
of Himself. Therefore, as members of the church, we are to show the
world what Christ is like through our fellowship, character, words,
and deeds.

     WAY                 A Matter of Life and Death
                                     Inge Gray
          Pray for Juliet and Elizabeth, Adventist women who live in the
      African country of Benin. They are married to two brothers who
      are not Adventists. Each of the men has multiple wives.
          The brothers wanted their wives to accompany them to a voo-
      doo ceremony, but Juliet and Elizabeth refused to go. They agreed
      to care for the children—their own and those of their husbands'
      other wives, who were going to the ceremony.
          While the husbands and their other wives were gone, a heavy
      rainstorm struck the village. The 6-year-old son of one of the other
      wives went outside to play in the rain. While he was digging in the
      mud, a papaya tree toppled over onto him and killed him. One of
      the villagers found the boy and rushed to tell the women. Juliet
      hurried to the place where the boy lay. When she arrived villagers
      had already determined that the child was dead. The villagers
      notified the police of the tragic accident.
          When the husbands returned and learned of the tragedy, the
      boy's father accused Juliet of killing the child and placing his body
      under the tree. He convinced some of the other villagers that Juliet
      had killed the child and that Elizabeth had been an accomplice.
          In Benin when a person is accused of a crime, the police take
      the accused to prison while they investigate the crime. There
      prisoners, especially women, often are abused and molested. Fear-
      ing this, Juliet's Adventist brother-in-law, uncle of the dead child,
      urged the villagers to tell the police what had happened. Because
      of his quick action, the women have not yet been arrested.
          Still unconvinced of her story, Juliet's husband demanded that
      she and Elizabeth drink a voodoo drink to prove their innocence.
      The women refused, saying that this would be a violation of their
      Christian beliefs. But the women did not know how to prove their
       innocence. The little group of Adventist believers prayed earnestly
      that God would help them know what to do. When the mission
       president arrived unexpectedly in their village the following Sab-
       bath, the believers rejoiced that God had answered their prayers!
          The pastor counseled the small group, and encouraged them to
       remain faithful. We still do not know the outcome of this case.
       Pray for these women and the other Adventists who live in this
       village, that God's love will shine through their lives, even in
       tragedy.

       president of the Benin Mission.

       The Apostolic Church




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Acts 2; 14:21-27.

  MEMORY TEXT: "And with great power the apostles gave
  witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And great grace
  was upon them all" (Acts 4:33, NKJV).

   KEY QUESTIONS: What characterized the church after Christ
returned to heaven? What difference did these characteristics make to
the life and mission of the church? Should the church today exhibit
these same characteristics? If so, why? If not, why not?

    THE NEW TESTAMENT CHURCH IN ITS FIRST CENTURY
WAS FULL OF VIGOR AND GRACE. The witness of the apostles
concerning Christ's life and teachings, His sacrifice and resurrection,
activated the vision of all believers and inspired the church to evange-
lize the entire world rapidly.
    The success of the gospel was a result of the Holy Spirit's work
through the lives of believers. The apostles were of one accord. "Christ
filled their thoughts; the advancement of His kingdom was their aim.
In mind and character they had become like their Master, and men
`took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.' "
—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 45.
    The power and gifts the apostles received at Pentecost gave effi-
ciency to their evangelistic efforts. The promise that this power will
be revived among us in these last days makes our study of the apos-
tolic church more meaningful. "Before the final visitation of God's
judgments upon the earth there will be among the people of the Lord
such a revival of primitive godliness as has not been witnessed since
apostolic times."—The Great Controversy, p. 464.

PENTECOST (Acts 2).

   What was Christ's promise and command to His disciples be-
fore His final ascension to heaven? Acts 1:6-9.

Promise:


Command:


   "As the disciples waited for the fulfillment of the promise, they
humbled their hearts in true repentance and confessed their
unbelief. . . .
   "The disciples prayed with intense earnestness for a fitness to meet
men and in their daily intercourse to speak words that would lead
sinners to Christ. Putting away all differences, all desire for the su-
premacy, they came close together in Christian fellowship."—The
Acts of the Apostles, pp. 36, 37.

   How would you describe the result of the apostles' submission
to Christ's instructions? Acts 2:1-8, 41-47; 4:13, 33.


   The day of Pentecost was not a unique and unrepeated manifesta-
tion of God's power through the apostles' witness. It was the inaugu-
ration of the power that increasingly attended their work until the
close of their lives, as the entire book of Acts makes evident.
   "Everywhere the gospel was proclaimed. . . . The hearts of the
disciples were surcharged with a benevolence so full, so deep, so far
reaching, that it impelled them to go to the ends of the earth, testify-
ing, God forbid that we should glory, save in the cross of our Lord
Jesus Christ. As they proclaimed the gospel as the power of God unto
salvation, hearts yielded to the power of the Holy Spirit. New territory
was daily added to the church."—My Life Today, p. 61.
   If we put away selfishness, dissension, pride, and vanity as did the
early disciples, the same zeal for Christ's glory and for the salvation of
others will produce similar results.

    Someone has said that "before Christ sent the church into the
 world, He sent the Spirit into the church. The same order must
 be observed today." Pray now for the power of Pentecost in your
 life. Is there anything other than praying that you can do to
 ensure that the Holy Spirit will fill your life?


                                                                      39

AN EXEMPLARY CHURCH (Acts 16:5).

   The first-century church, despite its faults and challenges, was
fervently committed to Christ, studying His Word and evangelizing
the world. The church also demonstrated a spirit of fellowship and
practical kindness unparalleled in any social group the world had yet
known (Acts 4:31-35; 11:28-30; Rom. 15:25, 26). All this was espe-
cially true in the years immediately following Calvary.

   What was the secret of the church's vitality and success? Acts
4:9-13.


    Being with Jesus. "Our life is to be bound up with the life of
Christ; we are to draw constantly from Him, partaking of Him, the
living Bread that came down from heaven, drawing from a fountain
ever fresh, ever giving forth its abundant treasures. If we keep the
Lord ever before us, allowing our hearts to go out in thanksgiving and
praise to Him, we shall have a continual freshness in our religious life.
Our prayers will take the form of a conversation with God as we
would talk with a friend. He will speak His mysteries to us person-
ally. . . .
   "In those who possess it, the religion of Christ will reveal itself as a
vitalizing, pervading principle, a living, working, spiritual energy.
There will be manifest the freshness and power and joyousness of
perpetual youth. . . .
   "This experience gives every teacher of truth the very qualifica-
tions that will make him a representative of Christ."—Christ 's Object
Lessons, pp. 129, 130.

   As the church grew in size, it was natural for difficulties to
arise. The apostles, through their letters preserved for us, coun-
seled the young church regarding controversial matters. How did
the churches generally receive these messages and with what ef-
fect? 2 Cor. 7:8-16; 1 Thess. 2:13, 14.


   The churches' acceptance of God's Word spoken through His mes-
sengers gave them strength, unity, restoration, and maturity. Thus
they were instilled with a moral stamina not easily corrupted. The
apostles did not act as tyrants, but as loving guardians and guides of
the flock (2 Cor. 1:24; 1 Peter 5:1-3).

    Do you welcome words of correction from God, or do you
 treat such correction as an insult?

AN ORGANIZED CHURCH (Titus 1:5; Col. 2:5).

    The apostles labored to build up the church because they knew that
the church is God's visible family, called to evangelize the world.
They quickly recognized that organization is not a foe of spirituality,
if it is designed to maintain gospel order. Without organization and
system, the work of the church would fall into disorder, and false
teachers would arise. The apostles predicted that although this would
happen, consecrated believers everywhere would continue to keep the
commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus (1 Tim. 6:3-5;
Rev. 12:17).

   In the first column, briefly state the circumstances that stimu-
lated the early church to organize. In the second column, state the
results of their efforts.

                    Circumstances                    Results

Acts 1:14-26


Acts 4:31-37


Acts 6:1-7


Acts 15:1-31

   "The order that was maintained in the early Christian church, made
it possible for them to move forward solidly, as a well-disciplined
army, clad with the armor of God. The companies of believers, though
scattered over a large territory, were all members of one body; all
moved in concert, and in harmony with one another. When dissension
arose in a local church . . . and the believers were unable to come to an
agreement among themselves, such matters were not permitted to
create a division in the church, but were referred to a general council
of the entire body of believers, made up of appointed delegates from
the various local churches, with the apostles and elders in positions of
leading responsibility."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 95, 96.

    What circumstances in your local church or the church at
 large might be solved in the same manner?
    If the early church had not valued organization, how would
 the progress of the gospel have been affected?

                                                                     41

UNITY IN THE FACE OF CHALLENGES (Acts 15:1-6).

   Two dangers the early church faced were persecution and theologi-
cal controversy. But persecution fostered unity and gave unexpected
impetus to evangelism. (See Acts chapters 3-5 and 8:1-4.) So Satan
decided to stir up disagreements.

  What controversy between Jewish and Gentile Christians at
Antioch necessitated a general council at Jerusalem? Acts 15:1-6.


   Many Hebrew Christians, afraid that the Gentile converts would
undermine the distinctive, divinely established features of their faith,
sought to bring all believers under the ceremonial law, including
circumcision. But Paul, Barnabas, and some of their associates taught
that the ceremonial law had been abrogated at Calvary.

   How did the apostles deal with the concern the legalistic party
among the Jewish Christians felt regarding the increasing number
of Gentile believers? What was the outcome of the apostles' ef-
forts? Acts 15:3, 4, 7-31.


   The council engaged in theological discussion and received reports
on the progress of the gospel among the Gentiles. The delegates
settled the debate largely by considering how overwhelmingly the
Spirit was revealing the power of salvation worldwide.
   "The . . . main question at issue seemed to present before the
council insurmountable difficulties. But the Holy Spirit had, in reality,
already settled this question, upon the decision of which seemed to
depend the prosperity, if not the very existence, of the Christian
church."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 192.
   The council's Spirit-directed decision made it possible for the
church to assimilate Gentile converts.

   "The principle at stake was quite simple and completely fundamen-
tal. Was the gift of God for the select few or for all the world? If we
possess it ourselves are we to look on it as a privilege or as a responsi-
bility? The problem may not meet us nowadays in precisely the same
way; but there still exist divisions between class and class, between
nation and nation, between colour and colour. We fully realize the true
meaning of Christianity only when all middle walls of partition are
broken down."—William Barclay, The Acts of the Apostles, rev. ed.
(Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1955), p. 113.

PAUL AND THE CHURCH (Acts 26:19).

  Saul the Pharisee once thought himself duty-bound to persecute the
church. But Jesus transformed him into a passionate witness for Christ.

  Following his dramatic conversion, how did the Lord connect
Paul with the church? Acts 9:4-19.


   Paul was converted and called directly into apostleship by Christ
without the invitation or effort of the church. Yet, once having cap-
tured Paul's heart, Jesus led him into direct association with His
church, an association that Paul cherished for the rest of his days.
   "Thus Jesus gave sanction to the authority of His organized church,
and placed Saul in connection with His appointed agencies on earth.
Christ had now a church as His representative on earth, and to it
belonged the work of directing the repentant sinner in the way of life.
   "Many have an idea that they are responsible to Christ alone for
their light and experience, independent of His recognized followers on
earth. Jesus is the friend of sinners, and His heart is touched with their
woe. He has all power, both in heaven and on earth; but He respects
the means that He has ordained for the enlightenment and salvation of
men; He directs sinners to the church, which He has made a channel of
light to the world."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 122.

  What action did the Lord direct His church to take regarding
Paul and Barnabas? Acts 13:1-3.


   Although Paul and Barnabas had already been active and fruitful
under God's direct appointment, the Spirit of the Lord directed the
leaders of the church to endorse this appointment by a ceremonial
laying on of hands.
   Through the church, God "communicates His purposes and His
will. He does not give to one of His servants an experience independ-
ent of and contrary to the experience of the church itself. . . . In His
providence He places His servants in close connection with His church
in order that they may have less confidence in themselves and greater
confidence in others whom He is leading out to advance His work."
—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 163.

    Determine from the following texts Paul's concept of the
 church. How does it compare with your own? 1 Tim. 3:15;
1 Cor. 12:4-28; Eph. 4:1-16; 5:25-32.


                                                                      43

church was organized, read "The Seven Deacons" in The Acts of the
Apostles, pp. 87-96.

   Unity in diversity. When Jesus told His disciples to take the gospel
to all nations (Matt. 28:19), that is exactly what they did. Read the
following texts, and locate the places they mention on the map (This
will help you to comprehend the diversity of cultures and nationalities
that composed the apostolic church.): Acts 2:5-11; 8:4, 5, 26, 27; 10:1;
13:4.
   Acts 13:1 also describes diversity in church leadership. "The dif-
ferent connections and activities of the men mentioned here indicate
that the church at Antioch enjoyed a cosmopolitan leadership. Barnabas
was a Cypriote; Lucius, a Cyrenian; Manaen, apparently a Palestinian
aristocrat; and Saul, a rabbi from Tarsus in Cilicia. . . .
   "Simeon. This man's first name, Simeon, or Simon, indicates that
he was of Jewish origin. His second name is a Latin adjective meaning
`black,' which he may have assumed, or may have been given, be-
cause of a dark complexion."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6,
p. 279.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Judging from such texts as Acts 1:14; 9:36-42; 16:11-15;
     17:4, 12; 18:1-3, 24-28; Romans 16:1-4, 6, 7, 12, 15, what
     was the role of women in the apostolic church?

   2. How can unity and spiritual purity be preserved in the
      church in light of Jesus' prayer in John 17? What provision
      has God made to accomplish this unity?

   3. "Primitive godliness" was a hallmark of the apostolic church.
      What are the true characteristics of such godliness? How
      can "primitive godliness" be the primary characteristic of
      our church today?

SUMMARY: Blazing with the light of Christ's love and teaching, the
early church forged ahead, planting everywhere the standard of Calvary's
cross. The immensity of the work and the diversity of the peoples
reached by the gospel did not diminish God's power to preserve unity
within the church.
   The Lord maintained the integrity of His gospel and the bonds of
fellowship in two ways: (1) through councils with appropriately ap-
pointed representatives from the world field and (2) through the in-
spired writings of the apostles and prophets.

          God takes sincere people where they are and leads them gently
       to Himself. Alexei Sergeev is an administrator at the renowned
       Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. It was his love of
       art that drew him to the Saviour.
          As a child he was awed by the beautiful icons—religious
       paintings that decorate the walls and ceilings of Russian Ortho-
       dox churches. While still a student at the University of Leningrad,
       Sergeev began working at the Hermitage Museum. He noticed
       that many of the greatest works of art depicted scenes from the
       Bible. He wanted to know this God who inspired such magnifi-
       cent art. He went to the library and asked for a Bible, but he was
       told that only those with special permits could read the Bible.
           For years he sought to get a Bible. One day while on a train, he
       noticed a man reading a Bible. Boldly he asked how he could get
       a Bible, and the man told him to meet him the next Saturday at the
       metro station, and he would try to help him get one.
           The men met as planned, and walked some distance to a small
       house behind a cemetery. Inside Sergeev found 25 Christians
       meeting secretly. He took a seat near the door—just in case the
       secret police raided the home. As he watched and listened to the
       singing and scripture reading, he felt God's love welling in his
       heart.
           He returned the following Saturday, and began studying the
       Bible with them. For security purposes, he did not even tell them
       his name. There was no Bible for him, so believers shared their
       own. One day a visitor came to the church and brought one
     . Russian Bible. The pastor gave it to Sergeev. As he studied, he
       began to understand God's plan for humanity, and His command
       to keep the Sabbath. But his work at the Hermitage kept him from
       attending regularly, and he postponed his baptism until he could
       obtain Sabbaths off. He attended this house church for 15 years
                            before he could openly join through baptism.
                               "For years Communism tried to stamp out
                            Christianity in the Soviet Union," he says.
                            "'Their leaders destroyed or desecrated many
                            churches, but they could not destroy the faith
                            in the heart of Christians."

      The Missionary Nature
          of the Church




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Acts 1, 2; Gen. 12:1-3; Matt.
28:16-20.

   MEMORY TEXT: "But you shall receive power when the Holy
   Spirit has come upon you; and you shall be witnesses to Me in
   Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the
   earth" (Acts 1:8, NKJV).

   KEY QUESTION: What is the primary purpose of the church?

    THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THE CHURCH IS TO SPREAD
THE GOSPEL. The gospel (good news) is the power of Christ's atone-
ment, a clear explanation of prophecy and of God's judgment, and the
call to obedience through faith.
    In the Lord's plan, the church is a dynamic missionary enterprise
that encompasses all humanity. We find the key mandate for that
mission in Genesis 12:1-3 and Matthew 28:18-20. "Every true disciple
is born into the kingdom of God as a missionary. He who drinks of the
living water becomes a fountain of life. The receiver becomes a giver.
The grace of Christ in the soul is like a spring in the desert, welling up
to refresh all."—The Desire of Ages, p. 195.
    "Churches are to be organized and plans laid for work to be done
by the members of the newly organized churches. This gospel mis-
sionary work is to keep reaching out and annexing new territory,
enlarging the cultivated portions of the vineyard. The circle is to
extend until it belts the world."—Evangelism, p. 19.
    This week we will look at the church as a missionary enterprise and
what that means for us.

GOD AND THE NATIONS (Acts 17:26).

   The first 11 chapters of Genesis outline the history of the world up
to the time of Abraham. In these chapters, the Lord's covenant with
Adam and Eve outlines His intention to evangelize lost humanity
(Gen. 3:15). Enoch becomes a living example of the power of the
everlasting gospel. And Methuselah's very name, meaning "when he
dies, it will come," becomes a living testimony that "the hour of His
judgment has come." The judgment in this case was the Flood. Thus,
we see the essence of the three angels' messages at the beginning of
history as well as at the end.
   Next, God renews the covenant with Noah and his family, this time
with a visible sign still with us—the rainbow. The table of nations in
Genesis 10 and 11 outlines God's intention to deal with all humanity
under the provisions of His covenant.

   Explain Paul's statement recorded in Acts 17:26 that God de-
termines where people should live.


    Look carefully at verse 27. Paul is telling the pagan Athenians that
they cannot escape the presence of God. He places people close to
someone or some group that will witness to them about His love.
   "In that age of caste, when the rights of men were often unrecog-
nized, Paul set forth the great truth of human brotherhood. . . . In the
sight of God all are on an equality, and to the Creator every human
being owes supreme allegiance. Then the apostle showed how, through
all God's dealings with man, His purpose of grace and mercy runs like
a thread of gold."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 238.

 How does Jonah fit this picture? Why did he run? Jonah 4:1-3.
Why did the Lord bring him back? Jonah 4:10.


   God reaches down into a small town, finds a man with the ability to
do the job, and sends him as a missionary. But the man does not want
to go, because he dislikes the people God wants him to help. But
because the Lord wants the Assyrians saved, He nearly forces him to
go. The result is a major revival. That God was determined to evan-
gelize the Assyrians, even if the reluctant missionary was not, illus-
trates His passion to save the human race.

   Are there people you do not like, but who need to know about
 Christ? God plans to get the message to them some way. Quite
 possibly through you!

                                                                    47

THE CALL OF ABRAHAM AND THE MISSION OF THE
CHURCH (Gen. 12:1-3).

   What does Genesis 12:1-3 say regarding the missionary nature
of Abraham's call and commission?


   Again the Lord reaches down into a pagan, moon-worshiping com-
munity and finds a person ready to do His bidding. He moves Abraham
and his family to an area that gives access to a continual flow of
people, and He commissions them to spread the gospel. Genesis 10-
12 tells us in essence that God made space within the nations for a
special group (Abraham and his descendants), who would be a king-
dom of priests and a holy nation (Exod. 19:6). Thus the presence of
God would be among His people, and the presence of His people
would be in the midst of humanity. The apostle Paul later followed this
pattern, recognizing that his mission to the Gentiles was his "priestly
duty" (Rom. 15:16, NIV).
   "This hope of redemption through the advent of the Son of God as
Saviour and King, has never become extinct in the hearts of men.
From the beginning there have been some whose faith has reached out
beyond the shadows of the present to the realities of the future. Adam,
Seth, Enoch, Methuselah, Noah, Shem, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—
through these and other worthies the Lord has preserved the precious
revealings of His will. And it was thus that to the children of Israel, the
chosen people through whom was to be given to the world the prom-
ised Messiah, God imparted a knowledge of the requirements of His
law, and of the salvation to be accomplished through the atoning
sacrifice of His beloved Son."—Prophets and Kings, p. 682.

   Review the last phrase in Genesis 12:3. What are its implica-
tions for the role of the church in world evangelization?


   The act of electing Abraham coincided with the promise or pros-
pect of blessing for the nations. Abraham and his Israelite descendants
were elected for service. "The purpose of the election is service, and
when service is withheld the election loses its meaning, and therefore
fails."—H. H. Rowley, The Biblical Doctrine of Election (London:
Lutterworth Press, 1950), p. 52.

    What does the connection between election and service mean
 to you personally as a church member today? If you refuse to
 serve God, are you still one of His elect?

JERUSALEM: MISSION CENTER OF THE EARTH (Isa. 2:2).

  What does Isaiah 2:2 say about Jerusalem's (Zion's) role in
world evangelization during Old Testament times?


    It was always the Lord's plan that Israel would act as a missionary
agency to spread the good news. (See Isa. 14:1, NIV.)
   A key passage indicates that the coming Messiah would be sent to
all nations: "Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen one in
whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him and he will bring justice to
the nations" (Isa. 42:1, NIV; see also Matt. 12:18).
    In Old Testament times, God's main approach to evangelism was
to make Israel a model people, conspicuously situated among the
nations. Non-Judaic peoples would travel to Jerusalem to see why all
these good things were happening, and they would be taken to church—
the temple. (See Deut. 4:5-8.) Thus Jerusalem became a magnet,
drawing people to a central sanctuary. (See diagram.) Israel's dis-
cipleship responsibility rested in their God-given call to be a model
for the world in social and religious life.

  How does the queen of Sheba's visit to Solomon illustrate the
"centripetal" mission concept? 1 Kings 10:4, 5.


   The queen of Sheba made the trip to Jerusalem because she "heard
about the fame of Solomon and his relation to the name of the Lord"
and wanted to "test him with hard questions" (1 Kings 10:1, NIV). She
returned home with a clear picture of the Lord. "Praise be to the Lord
your God. . . . Because of the Lord's eternal love for Israel, he has
made you king, to maintain justice and righteousness" (1 Kings 10:9,
NIV). Centuries later, one of her countrymen would discover the
connection between the Jewish religion and Christianity through a
missionary he met on a desert road (Acts 8:26-40).

                                                                     49
Wednesday                                           November 6
"SO SEND I YOU" (John 20:21).

   Yesterday we learned that the method of evangelization used in the
Old Testament was "centripetal." People from other nations were to
go to Jerusalem to learn about God.

   How did the system change in the New Testament? John 20:21.


   Jesus advocated a "sending" message. His mandate to the disciples
was, "As the Father has sent me, I am sending you" (John 20:21,
NIV). This system is known as "centrifugal." (See diagram in Tuesday's
lesson.) It emanates from a center. It no longer only draws people in,
but spreads them out to find other people to bring in. "The gospel
commission is the great missionary charter of Christ's kingdom. The
disciples were to work earnestly for souls, giving all the invitation of
mercy. They were not to wait for the people to come to them; they
were to go to the people with their message."—The Acts of the Apostles,
p. 28.

  Study John 4:35-38. What did Jesus "see" that the disciples did
not "see"? How urgent is soul winning?


    Two major events mark the agricultural year in Palestine—the
"early" and the "latter" rain. The early rain germinates the seed, and
the latter rain ripens the harvest. In John 4, Jesus pointed out to the
disciples that though they knew how to calculate correctly the time
between the two rains ("Do you not say, 'Four months more and then
the harvest'? "—John 4:35, NIV), they overlooked the fact that through
Jesus' eyes the fields were already ripe for the harvest, even before the
"latter rain"!
    In other words, many people everywhere are waiting for the good
news, as was the Samaritan woman whom Jesus found at Jacob's well.
The problem is the lack of harvesters to gather the people!
    The disciples had no church-growth eyes. They did not see any
Samaritans ready to harvest. But Jesus saw whole villages of them and
vast populations beyond Samaria.
    "The gospel invitation is not to be narrowed down, and presented
only to a select few, who, we suppose, will do us honor if they accept
it. The message is to be given to all."—The Desire of Ages, p. 194.

    Is your church-growth vision 20/20? Look around you! People
 just waiting to be "seen" also fill the city, town, or village where
 you live!

JESUS—THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD (Matt. 24:14).

   To us it does not seem strange to say that Jesus' message is for the
entire world. Matthew 24:14 is almost as well known as John 3:16. In
Jesus' time it was revolutionary to think that the gospel could go to
anyone not of Jewish blood. To the end of his days, Paul, the desig-
nated apostle to the Gentiles, called their inclusion in the kingdom "a
great mystery." (See Eph. 3:4-6.)

   How did Simeon describe the mission of Jesus? Luke 2:32.


    When Simeon blessed the Baby Jesus, he said that He would be a
"light for revelation to the Gentiles" (Luke 2:32, NIV). In his writings
John often directly refers to Jesus as the Saviour of the world.
                     Statement                            Text (NIV)
An atoning sacrifice for the whole world.                 1 John 2:2

"The Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the           John 1:29
world!"

 God sent His Son "to save the world."                    John 3:17

"We know that this man really is the Savior of the        John 4:42
world."

 "I am the Living bread . . . which I will give for the   John 6:51
 life of the world."

 I "will draw all men to myself."                         John 12:32

 "Let the world know that you sent me."                   John 17:23;
 "I am sending you."                                      20:21
   What do the three angels' messages say about world evangeli-
zation? Rev. 14:6.


   The messages borne by these angels is not a departure from the
gospel or an alteration of it, but an expansion, clarification, and
consummation of the everlasting gospel.
   "The message of Christ's righteousness is to sound from one end of
the earth to the other to prepare the way of the Lord. This is the glory
of God, which closes the work of the third angel."—Testimonies, vol.
6, p. 19.

                                                                      51
Friday                                             November 8
FURTHER STUDY: Read Isaiah 58. This week we studied in detail
the missionary nature of the church and how our election is for the
purpose of service. Such service is beautifully yet practically de-
scribed in this chapter.

   "I have been instructed to refer our people to the fitly-eighth
chapter of Isaiah. Read this chapter carefully and understand the kind
of ministry that will bring life into the churches. . . . When you meet
suffering souls who need help, give it to them. When you find those
who are hungry, feed them. In doing this you will be working in the
lines of Christ's ministry. The Master's holy work was a benevolent
work. Let our people everywhere be encouraged to have a part in it."
   "The union of Christlike work for the body and Christlike work for
the soul is the true interpretation of the gospel."—Welfare Ministry,
pp. 29, 33. (Also read "To Meet the Bridegroom," Christ's Object
Lessons, pp. 415-419.)

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Isaiah 58:13, 14 urges God's people to keep the Sabbath.
     How can doing so help us to assist suffering humanity?

   2. Discuss specific ways you can share the three angels' mes-
      sages in your community while carrying out the type of
      service described in Isaiah 58. Give special consideration to
      problems and issues that are affecting individuals in your
      part of the world.

   3. 'Why is the following statement true? "If left to itself, a
      church will inevitably spend most of its time and energy
      taking care of itself." What can your church do to avoid this
      problem?

SUMMARY: The church, by its very nature and design in the Lord's
plan, is a dynamic missionary enterprise that encompasses all human-
ity. Throughout the Bible it is pictured as such. Evangelization is the
core of all the church's activities.

                             The Changed Heart
                                   James Zachary
            "My husband hates the Bible!" the woman wept. "He was angry
        when he found me reading it. He threw it against the wall, then he
        tore it up. Finally he tried to burn it. This is all that I have of my
        Bible." She held up a few torn pages. "Then yesterday he struck my
        5-year-old daughter on her head. I don't know what to do."
            Sister Dauphney listened carefully as the woman poured out
        her misery to her. Then she said, "God loves you. And He does
        answer prayers. May I pray with you now?" After the women
        prayed, Sister Dauphney told her friend about some seminars
        being held nearby to help families find happiness.
            Just then the woman's husband came home. Out of work, he
        was angry and desperate. He told how a friend had offered to help
        him secure drugs he could sell to earn money. Again Sister Dauphney
        listened , then she said quietly, "God loves you and your family.
        He wants a better life for you. God is faithful, and His promises in
        the Bible are true."
            The man asked, "Can you help me get a Spanish Bible?"
            Sister Dauphney tried not to show her surprise and joy. "Yes, I
        can get a Bible for you," she smiled.
            The following day Sister Dauphney brought the man a Bible,
        and stayed to study with the couple. She invited them to attend
        evangelistic series, and to her joy, they both agreed to come. The
        couple took turns attending the meetings while one of them re-
        mained in their unfinished home to guard the family's meager
         possessions.
             Each morning Sister Dauphney joins the two pastors and 34
         church members to give progress reports, plan their daily visita-
         tion, and pray for the nearly 500 interests. Through their efforts
         more than 1,000 people have come to the evangelistic meetings
         each night.
             As she shared how God changed the heart of an angry husband,
                                 her eyes filled with tears of joy. He and his
                                 wife are preparing for baptism. God used
                                 the talents of a simple woman filled with
                                 love to win a family to Himself. He can use
                                 you, too, if you are willing to let Him.

        Church Organization




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Exod. 18:20, 21; Mark 3:13,
14; Acts 20:17, 28; 1 Cor. 14:33, 40; 1 Tim. 3:1-8, 15; Titus 1:4, 5.

   MEMORY TEXT: "For God is not the author of confusion, but
   of peace, as in all churches of the saints" (1 Corinthians 14:33).

  KEY QUESTIONS: Why is organization in the church necessary?
How can organization help to accomplish the mission goals of the
church?

   CHRIST IS THE AUTHOR OF ORGANIZATION IN THE
UNIVERSE AND IN HIS CHURCH. He established and organized
His church for sharing the gospel with the world. Through the church
He reveals the fullness of His love. In His church, which is the
embassy of His heavenly kingdom, we are sheltered from Satan's
power and restored to the image of God. The church is God's visible
family, whose fellowship and activities are to reflect the heavenly
society of which it is a part.
   Organization under God gives peace, stability, harmony, balance,
consistency, and purpose to every aspect of our lives. The opposite of
organization is anarchy. And the fruit of anarchy is chaos. Sound
organization is not opposed to personal uniqueness or individual rights.
Instead, it preserves the value and dignity of the individual in proper
connection with the social order of the universe (Rom. 14:7, 19). The
binding principle of divine organization is love (Eph. 1:9, 10). And
the object of the church is to demonstrate the operations of God's love
among a united family of believers whose own love, originating with
Him, extends to all the world in a ministry of reconciliation (Eph.

ORIGIN OF CHURCH ORGANIZATION (Exod. 18:13-27; Mark
3:13, 14).

   What Old Testament precedent do we have for church organi-
zation? Exod. 18:13-27.


   "He [God] designs that we should learn lessons of order and orga-
nization from the perfect order instituted in the days of Moses, for the
benefit of the children of Israel"—Christian Service, p. 73.
   It is important to note in verse 21 that Moses' appointed counselors
were men who held the honor of God supreme and who were free of
deceit, partiality, and self-interest. Thus not only were the people
properly served, but they could also esteem their leaders as men of
outstanding character, whose counsel they could heed and whose
authority they could respect.
   "Thou wilt surely wear away" (Exod. 18:18, KJV). "You and
these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out"
(NIV). Jethro wisely counseled Moses to organize the people before
both he and they wore out their health. Overextending ourselves, even
for the Lord, seldom accomplishes more. And once we are worn out,
we can accomplish nothing. Organization not only helps us to be more
efficient, it can also protect our health.

 Describe the formal action Christ took to establish His church.
Mark 3:13, 14.


   "The first step was now to be taken in the organization of the
church that after Christ's departure was to be His representative on
earth. . . .
   "Jesus had called His disciples that He might send them forth as
His witnesses, to declare to the world what they had seen and heard of
Him. Their office was the most important to which human beings had
ever been called, and was second only to that of Christ Himself. They
were to be workers together with God for the saving of the world."
—The Desire of Ages, p. 291.
   In addition to ordaining the 12, Christ sent forth 70 other laborers,
two by two, with instructions on how to conduct their gospel work
(Luke 10:1-9, 17-20).

   Consider how you feel when you have much to do. Are you
 able to get more done when you are organized? How could being
 more organized help you work for God more effectively?


                                                                    57

THE HEART OF ORGANIZATION (John 17:19-26).

   All true corporate unity in the church is founded in each believer's
unity with Christ. Such unity makes it possible for people of various
temperaments, talents, and cultures to live in harmony.

   For what did Christ pray on behalf of His disciples and all
future followers? Why? John 17:19-26.


   "The instruction given me by One of authority is that we are to
learn to answer the prayer recorded in the seventeenth chapter of John.
We are to make this prayer our first study."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p.
239.
   "Those who are truly connected with God will not be at variance
with one another. . . . His Spirit ruling in their hearts will create
harmony, love, and unity. . . . In union there is strength. In division
there is weakness and defeat.
   "The most convincing argument we can give to the world of Christ's
mission is to be found in perfect unity. . . . In proportion to our unity
with Christ will be our power to save souls. . . .
   "Little differences, dwelt upon, lead to actions that destroy Chris-
tian fellowship. . . . Let us keep drawing near to God, and He will draw
near to us. Then, as one, we shall reach upward to Him. The churches
will be as gardens of the Lord, under His cultivation."—Our High
Calling, p. 170.

   Describe the role of spiritual gifts in achieving unity. Compare
the assigning of various gifts to Moses' act of delegating authority
and work. Eph. 4:11-16.


   The unity for which Christ prayed cannot be enforced by ecclesias-
tical edict. The plea for unity is not a call to suppress discussion of
important matters among church members (Mark 9:33-37; Acts 15).
Unity is grounded in Christ's truth (John 17:17, 19).

   How can we discuss important matters and still maintain a
spirit of unity? Eph. 4:1-3, 17-32; 2 Tim. 2:19-26.


   What "little differences" do you find yourself dwelling upon,
disuniting yourself from the body of Christ? Pray that Christ
will bring us together in harmony with His teachings and His
purpose. (See Evangelism, pp. 370-372.)

WHY DO WE NEED ORGANIZATION TODAY? (Rev. 14:6; Luke
10:2).

  What makes church organization essential for our time? Rev.
14:6; Luke 10:2.


   We have a global task to accomplish—that of preaching the gospel
to everyone everywhere. This demands careful planning and coopera-
tive action.

   Regarding the development of our work in the early years of
our movement, we read: "As our numbers increased, it was evident
that without some form of organization there would be great confu-
sion, and the work would not be carried forward successfully. To
provide for the support of the ministry, for carrying the work in new
fields, for protecting both the churches and the ministry from unwor-
thy members, for holding church property, for the publication of the
truth through the press, and for many other objects, organization was
indispensable."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 26.

    Yet many members resisted the idea of organization, regarding
it as too authoritarian. This resistance, however, did not prevail:
"We sought the Lord with earnest prayer that we might understand His
will, and light was given by His Spirit that there must be order and
thorough discipline in the church—that organization was essen-
tial. . . . Order is the law of heaven, and it should be the law of God's
people on the earth.
    "We had a hard struggle in establishing organization. Notwith-
standing that the Lord gave testimony after testimony upon this point,
the opposition was strong, and it had to be met again and again. But
we knew that the Lord God of Israel was leading us, and guiding by
His providence. We engaged in the work of organization, and marked
prosperity attended this advance movement."—Testimonies to Minis-
ters, pp. 26, 27.
    This "work of organization" made it possible for our denomination
to establish schools, medical institutions, community-service centers,
missions, churches, and publishing houses.

   With regard to the church, what are we warned not to do? "Let
none entertain the thought that we can dispense with organization. . . .
It has been built up by His [God's] direction, through much sacrifice
and conflict. Let none of our brethren be so deceived as to attempt to
tear it down, for you will thus bring in a condition of things that you
do not dream of."—Testimonies to Ministers, pp. 27, 28.

                                                                     59

CHURCH OFFICES (Acts 14:23).

   If organization is to succeed, some form of administration and
oversight is necessary, for no corporate work ever goes forward with-
out direction and leadership (Prov. 8:14-16; Matt. 8:9; Rom. 13:1-3).
Consider Israel under the leadership of Moses and Joshua and the later
judges. Consider also the early church under the leadership of the
apostles and elders (1 Thess. 5:12, 13).

  What did the leaders of the early church do to give impetus,
consistency, and lasting effect to the spread of the gospel? Acts
14:23; 1 Tim. 3:1-8.


    "As an important factor in the spiritual growth of the new converts,
the apostles were careful to surround them with the safeguards of
gospel order. Churches were duly organized in all places . . . where
there were believers. Officers were appointed in each church, and
proper order and system was established for the conduct of all the
affairs pertaining to the spiritual welfare of the believers.
    "This was in harmony with the gospel plan of uniting in one body
all believers in Christ, and this plan Paul was careful to follow throughout
his ministry. Those who in any place were by his labor led to accept
Christ as the Saviour, were, at the proper time, organized into a
church. Even when the believers were but few in number, this was
done."—The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 185, 186.

  What attitude should people have who are holding office in
God's church? Matt. 20:20-28.


  How will such an attitude on the part of leaders affect the
morale of the people? Prov. 29:2.


   Worldly standards assess another person's greatness according to
many things: the number of people a person controls; a person's
academic standing or intellectual ability; one's yearly income or pos-
sessions; the number of committees a person is a member of; etc. But
with Christ such things are unimportant. The answer to the question
"Are you willing to serve others?" is the true test of the quality of a
good leader.

    The apostles ultimately caught the vision of the selfless love
 that Christ perfected. Pray that it will be so with you.

CHURCH DISCIPLINE (Matt. 18:15-18).

   Any organization must have a way of upholding its fundamental
principles. The disciplinary authority with which Christ invested His
church is never to be exercised in a dictatorial, critical manner. Re-
demption and restoration are the key purposes of all valid church
discipline.

   Read Matthew 18:15-18. How does Jesus' counsel regarding
church discipline suggest the responsibility of members to one
another? How does the carrying out of these responsibilities aid in
the church's growth?


   "As the erring one accepts the reproof offered in the love of Christ,
and acknowledges his wrong, asking forgiveness from God and from
his brother, the sunshine of heaven fills his heart. The controversy is
ended; friendship and confidence are restored. The oil of love removes
the soreness caused by the wrong; the Spirit of God binds heart to
heart; and there is music in heaven over the union brought about.
   "As those thus united in Christian fellowship offer prayer to God,
and pledge themselves to deal justly, to love mercy, and to walk
humbly with God, great blessing comes to them. . . .
   "And even if he does not repent, even if he stands outside the
church, God's servants still have a work to do for him. They are to
seek earnestly to win him to repentance. . . . His brethren are to
encourage him in the right way, treating him as they would wish to be
treated were they in his place, considering themselves, lest they also
be tempted."—Gospel Workers, pp. 500, 501.
   "Whatever you may bind upon the earth shall be that which has
already been bound in heaven" (Matt. 18:18, Randolph 0. Yeager,
 The Renaissance New Testament). Christ was not suggesting in this
verse that the church was infallible or had the right to establish its own
directives or judgments, but that the church can require only what
heaven requires and can forbid only what heaven forbids.

   What are some occasions for exercising discipline in the church?
1 Cor. 5:1-5, 9-13; 2 Thess. 3:6, 10-15.


    The word discipline comes from a Latin word that means
 "teaching" or "learning." How can church discipline be a form
 of teaching or learning?
    Without being disloyal to the church, how can you help some-
 one whom the church has disciplined?

                                                                      61
Friday                                           November 15
FURTHER STUDY: The apostle Paul was creative and highly pro-
gressive—a definite individualist. Such a person could easily become
a "maverick," a militant nonconformist, unconnected with any organi-
zation. What regulating elements existed in Paul's vision of life that
made him an advocate of church unity? Rom. 14:7, 19; 1 Cor. 1:10;
9:19; 10:32, 33; 12:13-27; Eph. 1:22, 23; 3:8-12.

   Notice that these same elements kept him from becoming an orga-
nizational robot: Acts 20:20-35; Gal. 1:10-12; 2:14-16; 1 Thess. 2:4-6.
Also read "Jew and Gentile" in The Acts of the Apostles, p. 200.
   "The great apostle Paul was firm where duty and principle were at
stake; he preached Christ with great boldness; but he was never harsh
and impolite. He had a tender heart, and was ever kind and thoughtful
of others. Courtesy was a marked trait of his character. . . .
   "The most Christlike professors are those who are the most kind.
pitiful, and courteous; their convictions are firm and their characters
strong; nothing can swerve them from their faith or allure them from
their duty."—My Life Today, p. 193.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. After studying this week's lesson, how would you answer
     the Key Questions in Sabbath Afternoon's material?

   2. What qualities in the teachings and life of Christ encourage
      the systematic gathering and fellowship that has marked
      the course of the church in all ages?

   3. Why is salvation not a completely private affair that encour-
      ages believers quietly to keep their faith to themselves while
      letting others learn directly from God without human aid?

   4. Some large regions of North Africa, Asia, and the Middle
      East are almost entirely unreached by the gospel. How can
      church organization contribute to solving this problem?

SUMMARY: Christ has organized His church to complete His family
by systematically evangelizing the world. To the close of time, church
organization is to reflect the wisdom of heaven, not the policies and
programs of humans. Church leaders are not overlords; they are
undershepherds. Their authority is centered in the Word of God,
which they are to uphold in their own teaching and life practice.
Church discipline should be exercised in a spirit of fellowship and
community to fairly and faithfully uphold the gospel and reclaim
members who are in spiritual jeopardy.

                               A Child's Song
      Eg7                        Isabelle Soalahy

           Little Hery lay in the hospital bed. His eyes were closed against
       the pain that threatened to overwhelm him. This chubby 2 1/2-
       year-old boy had been burned when a pot of hot water spilled on
       his legs. His parents sat silently at his bedside, wishing desper-
       ately that they could take the pain away.
           Hery's Sabbath School teacher walked into the children's ward
       of the hospital in Madagascar, wearing a bright smile and carrying
       a small gift for her student. Hery opened his eyes and saw his
       teacher standing at the foot of his bed. "It hurts," he moaned,
       looking at the bandages that swaddled his legs.
           The teacher leaned over and whispered, "Hery, have you asked
       Jesus to help you feel better? Can you pray the prayer that you
       learned in Sabbath School?"
           Hery looked thoughtful for a moment, then closed his eyes.
       "Dear Jesus," he said. Bless Daddy and Mommy, and bless me.
       Amen."
           The teacher visited for a few minutes, then reminded Hery that
       when he felt lonely or hurt, he could sing a song to help him feel
       better. The little boy nodded from his pillow and smiled bravely
       as his teacher walked toward the door of the hospital ward.
           A few days later visitors in the children's ward of the hospital
       heard a little boy singing. They stopped talking and listened as the
       clear words and sweet melody caught their ear. "Jesus loves me, I
       am happy," little Hery sang. It was his favorite song in the cradle-
       roll class at Sabbath School. This little boy who bore so much
       pain was singing of his best Friend.
           Little Hery died from his injuries, but the message he left in the
       hearts of those who heard his song bore fruit for the Saviour. Two
       of the people who had heard Hery's song were a father and mother
        whose child was in the hospital ward with Hery. They had seen
       the little boy's struggle, watched the church members who visited
        him. They talked with Hery's parents, asked questions about their
        faith, and accepted the invitation to study the Bible in their home.
        Today this family—the parents and three children—are members
        of the church. They look forward to the day they can see little
        Hery and tell him that his song guided them to heaven.

         Isabelle Soalahy is director of children's ministries in the North
       Malagasy Mission in Madagascar.

Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 5:13-16; Phil. 2:14-
16; Col. 2:6-13; Titus 2:11-14.

   MEMORY TEXT: "For by one Spirit we were all baptized into
   one body . . . and have all been made to drink into one Spirit"
   (1 Corinthians 12:13, NKJV).

  KEY QUESTIONS: What does it mean to be a member of God's
family—the church? How and why does one's life change after be-
coming a part of this family?

   FIRMLY PLANTED ON THE ROCK. A young man in Europe
who did a great deal of mountain climbing in the Swiss and French
Alps was given this advice: "You have two hands and two feet. That
makes four. Always be sure that three out of the four are firmly on the
rock. It is the only rule of safety."—Donald Grey Barnhouse, Let Me
Illustrate (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Fleming H. Revell, 1967), p. 55;
adapted.
   This advice is also the only rule of spiritual safety. And a close
connection with Christ the Rock is the foundation of all church life. The
constant question of the member who is clinging to Him will be, "Lord,
how shall I best serve Thee, and glorify Thy name in the earth? How
shall I conduct my life to make Thy name a praise in the earth, and lead
others to love, serve, and honor Thee? Let me only desire and choose
Thy will. Let the words and example of my Redeemer be the light and
strength of my heart."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 129.
   For the next two weeks, we will study about church life—what it
includes, how it promotes the mission of the church, and how you can
be a part of it.

THE SECRET TO CHURCH LIFE (John 15:1-8).

   Yesterday, the experience of mountain climbing illustrated that
a connection to Christ is the basis of all church life. What image of
being connected to Christ do we find in John 15:1-8? Compare the
church to this image.


   "The branches in the True Vine are the believers who are brought
into oneness by connection with the Vine. . . .
   "The branches of the vine cannot blend into each other; they are
individually separate; yet every branch must be in fellowship with
every other if they are united in the same parent stock. . . .
   "Christian unity consists in the branches being in the same parent
stock, the vitalizing power of the center supporting the grafts that have
united to the Vine. In thoughts and desires, in words and actions, there
must be an identity with Christ, a constant partaking of His spiritual
life."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p.
1143.

  What evidence do we have that we are connected to Christ?
John 15:5; Gal. 5:16-26.


   When the branches abide in the vine, they take on the life of the
vine. When we abide in Christ, we will develop a character like His.
   To say that we are Christians and members of God's family is
meaningful only when we recognize our complete dependence on
Christ and live by faith in Him on a daily basis. This is what it means
to "abide." Then individually and as a church we will mirror the
graces and character of our Saviour. Then "we shall see a prosperous
church; for its members will not live unto themselves, but unto Him
who died for them, and they will be flourishing branches of the living
Vine."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5,
p. 1144.
   Maintaining a close connection with Christ enables us to have a
healthy religious experience on both a personal and a corporate level.
But how can the following elements of church life actually help us to
abide in Christ individually and as a church family? the Sabbath,
baptism, Communion, stewardship, active involvement, church attend-
ance, and Christian standards.

    How do we avoid legalism, the attempt to obey in our own
 strength?


                                                                      65

WHAT MEMBERSHIP MEANS (Eph. 5:25-27).

  List three reasons why Christians should be part of God's
church. Eph. 5:25-27; Phil. 1:16, 17; 1 John 1:7.

1.

2.

3.

   To be part of God's church is to be a member of His family, with all
the privileges and responsibilities that accompany family relation-
ships. Jesus adopts us as His children, not so we can have that privi-
lege only for ourselves, but so we will tell others how they too can
become members of His family.
   Ts* church is to be a gleaming temple in a dark world. Our light is
not to emanate from resplendent buildings, but from members clothed
in the radiant garments of Christ's righteousness.
   As God's church, we are not to be showcases of the latest fads and
fashions, but rather a benevolent society serving the world. Every
aspect of our service is to be filled with soul-winning purpose, for
humanity's greatest need is salvation.

   How should church members relate to one another? Who ben-
efits from such behavior besides the church itself? John 13:34, 35;
Rom. 12:3-13 (compare 1 Cor. 12:12-27).


    It is the exercise of Christlike love and mutual respect among
church members that makes the gospel attractive and believable. In
the goodness, mercy, justice, and love of God among church mem-
bers, the world has a demonstration of Christ's character. Loving
service to everyone, church members or not, is the compelling power
of the church's witness and the secret of its success.

  According to Christ's command, entrance into church mem-
bership is ratified by baptism (Matt. 28:19, 20). How does proper
preparation for baptism affect each member's influence in the
church? Acts 2:37-47; Rom. 6:3-22.

      What did baptism do for you?

BAPTISM (Rom. 6:4-6).

   Into what twofold association does baptism bring us? Gal. 3:27;
1 Cor. 12:13.



2.

   Have you ever heard anyone say, "I want to be baptized into Christ,
but I don't want to be baptized into any church"? Yet as we can see
from the texts above, to be baptized into Christ is also to be baptized
into His body, the church. Baptism is the divinely ordained means of
signifying conversion to Christ and adoption into the family of God
(Mark 16:16; John 3:5; Acts 2:38).
   This does not detract from the personal aspects of our communion
with God (Matt. 6:6; Ps. 73:23-26). Such communion strengthens us
for fellowship and corporate worship. When we are baptized, we
confess Christ before the world, and He confesses us before the Father
and His angels (Luke 12:8).

   What is the spiritual significance of baptism? Rom. 6:3-13; Col.
2:11-13.


   We are baptized because we have been "crucified with Christ"
(Gal. 2:20). "Baptism symbolizes the crucifixion of the old life. It is
not only a death but also a burial. We are 'buried with him in baptism'
(Col. 2:12). As a burial follows a person's death, so when the believer
goes down into the watery grave the old life that passed away when he
accepted Jesus Christ is buried."—Seventh-day Adventists Believe,
p. 185.
   But after His death and burial, Christ arose from the grave. And in
baptism we arise from our watery grave to a new life in Him. Then the
power that enabled Christ to arise enables us to live that life (Rom.
6:4). "This new life lifts us to a higher plateau of human experience,
giving us new values, aspirations, and desires that focus on a commit-
ment to Jesus Christ."—Seventh-day Adventists Believe, p. 185.

   When people came to John to be baptized, why did he rebuke
 some of them? Why is repentance (sorrow for sin and a turning
 away from it) necessary? Luke 3:7-16; Acts 2:36-39.




                                                                    67

THE ORDINANCE OF SERVICE (John 13:1-17).

   Yesterday we studied about baptism as part of church life. Today
and tomorrow we will study aspects of the Communion service.
   Jesus wanted to impress upon the church throughout its history the
value of His sacrifice and of His second coming. He also longed to
impress upon the church a clear sense of what it should be in its spirit
of service both within and without its ever-widening circle of fellow-
ship. He symbolized these truths by instituting the Communion serv-
ice, which includes the ordinance of foot washing.

   As you read John 13:1-17, look for the answers to the following
questions: (1) Why did Jesus wash the disciples' feet? (2) What
did He tell Peter? (3) What did He tell all His disciples?


    The roads in Palestine were either dusty or muddy. Because the
crude sandals of the people could not protect them against such dirt,
servants would wash the feet of guests before they entered the house.
But Jesus and His disciples had no servants. And obviously none of
thel2 would accept that duty. Only Jesus, the Son of God, would do
that!
    Christ designed this service to remind us that (1) He "made Himself
of no reputation, taking the form of a servant, and coming in the
likeness of men" (Phil. 2:7, NKJV); (2) we need regular cleansing
because we sometimes stumble and fall in the Christian walk, even
though we have accepted Christ and were cleansed by His blood;
(3) we need the spirit of humble, loving service that is free of jealousy,
pride, and self-centeredness.
   "This ordinance is Christ's appointed preparation for the sacramen-
tal service. . . . There is in man a disposition to esteem himself more
highly than his brother, to work for self, to seek the highest place; and
often this results in evil surtnisings and bitterness of spirit. The ordi-
nance preceding the Lord's Supper is to clear away these misunder-
standings, to bring man out of his selfishness, down from his stilts of
self-exaltation, to the humility of heart that will lead him to serve his
brother."—The Desire of Ages, p. 650.

    When Jesus washed His disciples' feet, He knew that one of
 them would betray Him and another would deny Him. Yet Jesus
 met this disloyalty with the greatest of humility and love. Pray
 that Jesus' attitudes will be yours. If His attitudes do become
 yours, how will this affect the way you treat your enemies, not
 only in the foot-washing service but in every situation?

TAKE, EAT, AND DRINK (Luke 22:15-20).

   "The Lord's Supper is to be a joyful season, not a time for sorrow.
The preceding foot-washing service provides an opportunity for self-
examination, confession of sins, reconciliation of differences, and
forgiveness. Having received the assurance of being cleansed by the
blood of the Saviour, believers are ready to enter into special com-
munion with their Lord. They turn to His table with joy, standing in
the saving light, not the shadow, of the cross, ready to celebrate the
redemptive victory of Christ."—Seventh-day Adventists Believe,
pp. 198, 199.

  What meaning did Jesus assign to the bread and grape juice?
Luke 22:15-20.


   The Communion service symbolizes Jesus' atoning death for our
sins and His desire that we should personally appropriate the saving
merits of His sacrifice. By instructing us that we are to keep this
ordinance until He returns, He made it an occasion for us to anticipate
and envision His second coming and the joys of participating in the
ultimate Communion in heaven (Mark 14:22-25).

  Describe the attitude with which we should approach the Lord's
Supper. 1 Cor. 11:27-29.


   How can we develop such an attitude? Luke 15:18-24; Ps. 51:6-
12, 17.


   Eating and drinking. Eating the symbol of Christ's body and
drinking the symbol of His blood represents the incorporation of
God's Word into our daily lives. In John 6:63, Christ says, "The words
that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life." And in
Matthew 4:4, He tells us that we "shall not live by bread alone, but by
every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God." As we allow the
Bible to teach us how we should live, we will be prepared to partake of
the Lord's Supper.

    How can the Communion service help to unite and stabilize
 the church? As you formulate an answer, consider 1 Corinthians
10:16, 17: "Is not the bread that we break a participation in the
 body of Christ? Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are
 one body, for we all partake of the one loaf" (NIV).

                                                                    69
Friday                                            November 22
FURTHER STUDY: What aspect of church life does Hebrews 10:25
promote, and why? What is the biblical basis and reason for corporate
worship? Exod. 20:8-11; Ps. 96:6-9; Acts 11:26.
   The reasons for church and Sabbath School attendance are many
and varied. They include the following: worship, praise, fellowship,
prayer, studying the Word, spiritual instruction, guidance, inspiration,
and the enrichment of personal and collective religious experiences.
Furthermore, Christ communicates not only to individual believers
but also to His churches (Rev. 2:7; 3:21, 22: 22:16, 17). We, therefore,
must be active in His church to receive and value His messages.

   "God teaches that we should assemble in His house to cultivate the
attributes of perfect love. This will fit the dwellers of earth for the
mansions that Christ has gone to prepare for all who love Him."
—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 368.

Lord's Supper" in Seventh-day Adventists Believe, pp. 194-213.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. After studying this week's lesson, how would you answer
     the Key Questions in Sabbath Afternoon's lesson?

  2. Do you think it is necessary to believe all the official doc-
     trines of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in order to be a
     faithful member? Explain your answer from Scripture. (Con-
     sider Gal. 1:8, 9; 2 Tim. 3:14-17; 4:1-5; 2 John 9; Rev.
     12:17.)

  3. As a Sabbath School member, how can you become more
     directly involved with soul-winning activity and the nurture
     of Sabbath School and church members? Perhaps meet
     together as a class this Sabbath or next to discuss this
     matter in detail.

SUMMARY: Church life is a sacred life based on our relationship
with our Saviour. It involves commitment, service, and intimate com-
munion with Christ and fellow believers. In joining His family, we
pledge ourselves to work with Him and our sisters and brothers to
evangelize the world.

                                      Sandy Ac Moody

           Flies swarmed inside Miriam's hut where they could escape the
        afternoon heat of the African sun. Several women sat on the dirt floor
        admiring Miriam's newborn baby, fat and healthy-looking.
             Sixteen-year-old Karia silently slipped into the hut. The fourth
        wife of a strict Muslim, she wore the traditional blue dress that
        covered her from head to foot. Her own baby was tied to her back. I
        wondered how she endured the 110° (41°C) heat. Karia collapsed
        onto a straw mattress on the floor. She was so young to feel so tired!
            It was the Muslim holy month, when no faithful Muslim could eat
        or drink during daylight hours. They eat and drink only before
        sunrise or after sunset. And while men cut back on their work during
        this time, the women work as hard as ever, carrying loads of fire-
        wood home on their heads, carrying water from the well, washing
        clothes in the river, pounding rice, and preparing meals. And Karia
        was nursing her baby, as well, yet, even though it was the hottest
        time of the year, during this month she was not even allowed to
        swallow her own saliva, let alone take a drink of water during the
        day! She told me she felt weak and dizzy.
            My heart ached for Karia. She looked pale, and moved slowly,
        like a woman far older than her years. But her life was little different
        from that of other women here in West Africa.
            At last, the month-long fast ends. The villagers gather for a mass
        prayer, followed by feasting.
            We pray that someday these people will accept the good news of
        Jesus' love, and be freed from the beliefs and rituals that bind them.
            Slowly people are being introduced to Jesus. One young man
        borrowed a cassette tape from us and played it on his tape deck to
        over 40 listening friends. They've asked for more! The people love
        visual aids—pictures and felts—and we use all we have to tell them
        of God's love. The Holy Spirit is working on hearts to open them to
        receive the message of freedom in Christ!

           Church Life, Part 2




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Exod. 20:8-11; 1 John 2:3-
11; 2 Cor. 6:14-7:1; Ps. 24:1; Mal. 3:9, 10.

   MEMORY TEXT: "Whatever is true, whatever is noble, what-
   ever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is
   admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about
   such things" (Philippians 4:8, NIV).

   KEY QUESTIONS: How are the Sabbath, stewardship, and main-
taining church standards a part of church life? How do these help to
fulfill the church's mission?

   SEEING THE GOSPEL. A man came to a mission station in central
China and asked to become a Christian, even though he had never heard
the gospel preached and could not read. When he was asked how he
knew about the gospel, he said that he had seen it. His neighbor, a man
who had long been a "worthless" opium addict, had journeyed to a
faraway town and returned transformed; he uprooted the poppies in his
garden, repaired his house, planted and tended his crops, and provided
for his family as a decent man should. The former addict said that the
gospel of Christ had changed his life. His neighbor, hearing about it,
came all the way to the mission station to become a Christian.
   A genuine Christian life explained the gospel more simply and
more effectively than any arguments could have done.

   How can the aspects of the Christian life we studied last week
 explain Christianity to others more effectively than any argu-
 ments? Keep this same question in mind for each aspect of
 Christian life we will study this week.

THE HAPPIEST OF DAYS (Exod. 20:8-11).

   To discover the meaning of the Sabbath, match the following
texts to the answers below: (a) Exod. 31:13; (b) Heb. 4:1-10;
(c) Exod. 20:11; (d) Rev. 14:9-12.

        The Sabbath is a memorial of God's creatorship.
        The Sabbath is a sign of sanctification.
       The Sabbath is a sign of loyalty to God.
        The Sabbath is a sign of righteousness by faith and of
        resting in Christ.

   Christ Himself customarily worshiped on the Sabbath (Luke 4:16).
And when He spoke to His disciples about the persecution that would
befall them after He returned to heaven, He urged them to pray that
their "flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath" (Matt. 24:20,
NKJV). After His death, He even rested in the tomb over the Sabbath,
thereby signifying that He had accomplished our redemption.
   The apostles likewise held the Sabbath in holy regard. When Christ
died, the disciples suspended His burial arrangements in order to
observe the seventh day (Luke 23:56-24:1). And Paul is well known
for attending church on Sabbath during his evangelistic journeys (Acts
13:14; 17:1, 2; 18:4).

  Isaiah 58:13 states that the Sabbath is a day of delight. How
does the Bible's guidance on Sabbath keeping and Christ's ex-
ample help it to be so? Exod. 20:9, 10; Matt. 12:12; Mark 2:23;
Luke 14:1.


   "To `remember the Sabbath day . . (Exod. 20:8), we must think of
the Sabbath throughout the week and make the preparations necessary
to observe it in a manner pleasing to God. We should be careful not to
so exhaust our energies during the week that we cannot engage in His
service on the Sabbath."—Seventh-day Adventists Believe,
p. 263.

   As beautiful as the newly created world was, "the greatest gift
 God could give to . . . [Adam and Eve] was the privilege of a
 personal relationship with Him. So He gave them the Sabbath, a
 day of special blessing, fellowship, and communion with their
 Creator."—Seventh-day Adventists Believe, p. 249. How might
 you reorder your work week so you can have more energy to
 observe the Sabbath as a day of fellowship with your Creator?


                                                                   73

PRINCIPLES OF CHRISTIAN STANDARDS (1 Peter 2:21).

   The issue of church-advocated standards of conduct and lifestyle is
sensitive and often misunderstood. Frequently this subject is con-
nected with the question, Does the church have the "right" to give
counsel in such issues as dress, diet, entertainment, and association?
For the person who believes in the Bible, the certain answer is yes, if
the church promotes only standards that the Bible clearly defines.
Scripture invests the church with the responsibility of directing its
members to observe those standards.
   If the church is to be faithful to its mission, it must adhere to the
whole counsel of God and, in the spirit of that counsel, uphold it as the
duty of its members (Acts 20:27, 28, 32). But the church is not
authorized to construct arbitrary standards or to enforce oppressively
even divine truths (Luke 11:46; 1 Peter 5:1-3).

   As in other matters, who and what should be the basis of
church standards? 1 Peter 2:21; 1 John 2:3-11 (compare Gal.
5:16, 19-26).


   "Higher than the highest human thought can reach is God's ideal
for His children. Godliness—godlikeness--is the goal to be reached."
—Education, p. 18; compare Isa. 55:8, 9. To embrace a lower stand-
ard than that of Christ and His law is to deprive oneself of gospel
blessings.

   What fundamental Bible principles undergird all Christian
standards? Rom. 12:1, 2; Gal. 5:16 (compare Phil. 4:8; 1 John
2:15-17).


   The practical result of conversion to Christ is to become like Him
in character and conduct, through the indwelling of His Holy Spirit.
This transformation is produced by His Word and His Spirit taking
effect in our lives (1 John 2:5, 6). Satan has taught the world to love
evil and hate righteousness. It is no wonder, then, that God's children
should embrace values and a way of life distinctively different from
those of the world.

    How do you view God's standards? Why do some people
 regard standards as burdensome? What can keep us from being
 either legalistic and self-righteous or lax in observance of Chris-
 tian standards? How can Bible standards become precious to us,
 even though they contravene attractive habits?

Tuesday                                          November 26
SPECIFICS OF CHRISTIAN STANDARDS (2 Cor. 6:14-7:1).

   How can the principles we studied yesterday help us define
standards regarding entertainment, dress, and health?

   "Christians win unbelievers not by looking and behaving like the
world but by revealing an attractive and refreshing difference. . . .
Instead of adorning the exterior . . . [Peter] counseled, let believers
concentrate on developing 'the hidden person of the heart, with the
incorruptible ornament of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very
precious in the sight of God' (1 Peter 3:1-4)."—Seventh-day Adventists
Believe, pp. 286, 287.
   Medical science has repeatedly borne out the validity of biblical
health laws with regard to food, temperance, work, exercise, and
cleanliness. (See Gen. 1:29; Prov. 23:29-35; Isa. 58:5-12; 2 Thess.
3:7-13.)
   "God is as truly the author of physical laws as He is author of the
moral law. His law is written with His own finger upon every nerve,
every muscle, every faculty, which has been entrusted to man."
—Counsels on Diet and Foods, p. 17. Divine laws do not restrict or
limit us, but disclose secrets of happiness, health, and success.

  Note next to each text the practical standards taught in the
Scriptures.

1 Cor. 10:6-8


Eph. 5:3, 4


Gal. 6:9, 10


Ps. 92:1-3; Col. 3:16, 17


1 Tim. 2:8-10; 1 Peter 3:3, 4

   Praising God on a daily basis helps us to keep our concerns in
proper perspective. "In looking upon our crucified Saviour who re-
deemed us from the penalty and delivers us from the power of sin, we
are motivated to do only 'those things that are pleasing in his sight'
(1 John 3:22)."—Seventh-day Adventists Believe, p. 288.


                                                                   75

MANAGING GOD'S GOODS (Ps. 24:1).

   A steward is a person authorized to manage another person's household
or estate. To the Christian, being a steward means that we manage
well the gifts God has given us. In its broadest sense, "stewardship
involves the wise and unselfish use of life."—Paul Smith, Managing
God's Goods, p. 21.
   Christ demonstrated genuine stewardship through His selflessness,
thus teaching us that stewardship involves total self-giving to Him and
service to the world. It is willingly sharing for the benefit of others
anything and everything God has given to us. Thus, as good stewards
we will cease to define life by how much money we earn, the titles we
gain, the people we know, where we live, or how much influence we
think we have.

   What are the five basic areas in which we are to be managers
for God?

1. Gen. 1:26; 2:15


2. Mal. 3:8-10


3. Matt. 25:14-28


4. 1 Cor. 6:19, 20


5. Eph. 5:15, 16

   "Modern science has made earth one vast laboratory for research
and experimentation. Such research yields many benefits, but the
industrial revolution has also resulted in air, water, and land pollution.
Technology, in some instances, has manipulated nature rather than
having managed it wisely.
   "We are stewards of this world, and should do everything to main-
tain life on all levels by keeping the ecological balance intact. In His
coming advent, Christ will 'destroy those who destroy the earth' (Rev.
11:18)."—Seventh-day Adventists Believe, p. 274.

    How can you improve your management of the blessings and
 gifts God has given you? Can you supply more of others' press-
 ing needs by limiting the supply of your own wants?

SUPPORTING GOD'S CHURCH (Mal. 3:9, 10).

   To ensure the spiritual nurture of Israel, God ordained that the
priests and Levites, who served in the temple, should devote their
lives to full-time ministry. Every Israelite was to support the priests
and Levites with the tithe, and those in ministry were also to tithe
(Num. 18:20, 21, 26). The Lord designated that the tithe was to be
returned to His storehouse, the church. "[The tithe] is holy unto the
Lord" (Lev. 27:30).
   Other examples of tithing include Abraham's giving Melchizedek,
the priest of God Most High, "tithes of all" (Gen. 14:18-20) and
Jacob's vow to give God a tenth of all that he received from his
Creator's hand (Gen. 28:22). God reaffirmed the tithing law as a holy
institution upon which Israel's success depended (Num. 18:24, 26,
28).
   In addition to the tithe, God commanded the people to return
offerings to build and maintain His temple and sustain its various
branches of service to His holy nation (Exod. 30:11-16; 2 Kings 12:4,
5; 2 Chron. 24:8-14).

  List the promises God makes to those who are faithful in tithes
and offerings. Mal. 3:10-12. What does He say to those who with-
hold tithes and offerings? Mal. 3:8, 9; Haggai 1:2-11.


   What endorsement does the New Testament give to the system
of tithes and offerings? Matt. 23:23; 1 Cor. 9:7-14.


   "In the days of Israel the tithe and freewill offerings were needed to
maintain the ordinances of divine service. Should the people of God
give less in this age? The principle laid down by Christ is that our
offerings to God should be in proportion to the light and privileges
enjoyed. 'Unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much
required.' Luke 12:48. . . . As our blessings and privileges are in-
creased—above all, as we have before us the unparalleled sacrifice of
the glorious Son of God—should not our gratitude find expression in
more abundant gifts to extend to others the message of salvation? The
work of the gospel, as it widens, requires greater provision to sustain it
than was called for anciently; and this makes the law of tithes and
offerings of even more urgent necessity now than under the Hebrew
economy."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 528, 529.

    With what motives and spirit should we return to the Lord
 that which He claims? 1 Chron 29:11-16; 2 Cor. 9:6-10.

                                                                      77

FURTHER STUDY: What lessons regarding stewardship does the
parable of the shrewd manager teach in Luke 16:1-15? Read any or all
of the following: "Friends by the Mammon of Unrighteousness" and
"Talents" in Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 366-375, 325-365; "The
Sabbath" in The Desire of Ages, pp. 281-289.

   "By beholding we are to become changed, and as we meditate upon
the perfections of our divine Model, we shall desire to become wholly
transformed and renewed in the image of His purity. There will be a
hungering and thirsting of soul to be made like Him whom we adore.
The more our thoughts are upon Christ, the more we shall speak of
Him to others, and represent Him to the world. We are called to come
out and be separate from the world, that we may be the sons and
daughters of the Most High; and we are under sacred obligation to
glorify God, as His children upon the earth. It is essential that the
mind should be stayed upon Christ, that we may hope to the end for
the grace that is to be brought unto us at the revelation of Jesus Christ
from heaven."—E. G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 3, p. 1145.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. After studying this week's lesson, how would you answer
     the Key Questions in Sabbath Afternoon's lesson?

   2. A large evangelistic campaign has been conducted in your
      area. Many converts have joined local Seventh-day Advent-
      ist churches, including yours. After a few weeks, many of
      these converts have fallen away. Some others who attend
      are still wearing jewelry and have been seen shopping on
      the Sabbath. How should you respond?
      a. Blame the pastor and the evangelist for having too many
          premature baptisms?
      b. Vow never to support another evangelistic campaign?
      c. Rebuke these new converts for their shaky commitment
          and lack of faithfulness to standards?
      d. Discuss your concern about the situation with the pastor
          and, perhaps, the church board?
      e. Personally befriend the new members, continue to study
          with them, and include them in small-group meetings
          and social fellowship?

SUMMARY: How we live as Christians can have a significant effect
on the church's mission. As the unconverted observe the results of our
love for Christ, both in our own character development and in our
service to the world, they also will be drawn to believe in Him.

                          Please Come, Daddy
     ER:7                       James Zachary

        The family stood by 8-year-old Kalinga's hospital bed. She awoke
     and whispered, "A man is coming to visit me." The family wondered
     who the man was. Later, when the Adventist pastor entered Kalinga's
     room,she said excitedly, "He is the man that I saw in my dream!"
        Kalinga's mother recognized the Adventist pastor. She and her
     children had attended the Adventist church several times. She intro-
     duced the pastor to her husband, an officer in a large bank in Papua
     New Guinea. Father was was always too busy to attend church. His
     every moment was filled with business contacts.
         One Sabbath after Kalinga returned home from the hospital, she
     saw her father loading his golf clubs into the car. He was on his way
     to play golf with some business friends. Kalinga asked him, "If Jesus
     were to come back today and ask me where you are, what should I
     tell Him? Do you want me to tell Him that you are playing golf?"
     Kalinga's father was startled. He had never considered religion as
     important, or thought of God as a person. He thought about his
     friends who were expecting him at the golf course.
         Kalinga took her father's hand. "Daddy, today is Visitors' Day. I
     want you to be my visitor. Please, Daddy, come with me." The
     pleading look in his little daughter's eyes touched his heart. He put
     away his golf clubs and went to change into his suit.
         Kalinga's mother was surprised when she saw her husband dressed
     up. "Where are you going this morning?" she asked.
         "To church," he said. "It is Visitor's Day, and I am Kalinga's
     visitor."
         That morning Kalinga did not go to her kindergarten class. "My
     daddy is a visitor. I will stay with him and help him make friends,"
     she told her teacher.
         Kalinga's father enjoyed church. When citywide evangelistic meet-
     ings were held on an outdoor field, he and his family attended, even
     on the nights when it rained. And when the meetings ended, Kalinga's
     father joined the baptismal classes.
                                               Kalinga is so happy that God
                                            used her to help win her father

         The Church Militant




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 13:24-30, 37-43;
1 Cor. 6:9-11; Eph. 6:10-18; Phil. 3:7-21; Rev. 12:17.

   MEMORY TEXT: "Not that I have already attained, or am
   already perfected; but I press on, that I may lay hold of that for
   which Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me" (Philippians 3:12,
   NKJV).

   KEY QUESTIONS: How does the Bible describe the church mili-
tant? What are its weapons? Who is its general? And what will be the
outcome of the battles it must fight?

   BOUND BY CHAINS to a Roman soldier, Paul had ample oppor-
tunity to study military armor. Perhaps this is how he came to under-
stand that Christians also have their armor (Eph. 6:10-18).
   The belt buckled around the soldier's waist held together his armor,
allowing him freedom of movement. How does the belt of God's truth
give us freedom? The soldier's breastplate protected his heart. How
does the breastplate of righteousness protect the Christian? Sandals
were the mark of a soldier prepared to move out. The sign of Chris-
tians on the move is their eagerness to share the gospel. The large,
oblong, wooden shield of the Roman soldier protected him from a dart
dipped in pitch, then set on fire. Upon impact, the shield smothered
the dart. What are Satan's darts? And how does the shield of faith
protect us from them? A soldier's helmet protects his head, the center
of will and intelligence. How does the helmet of salvation protect us?
A soldier wields his sword both defensively and offensively. How is
the sword of God's Word an offensive and defensive weapon for
Christians?

ON THE MARCH (Dan. 11:32-35).

   The church militant represents the church's efforts throughout its
history to share the gospel with the world. It is called militant, not
because it employs violent means to fulfill its commission, but be-
cause its spiritual life and endeavors have repeatedly brought it into
conflict with the ruling powers of darkness on earth (Gal. 4:29). In
addition, spiritual weaknesses and shortcomings have produced strife,
discord, and division in the church militant for many centuries.
   In the zeal of His love, God will miraculously accomplish His goal
to have a pure church (Eph. 5:27). It is our privilege to understand this
goal and cooperate with Him in hastening the fulfillment of His plan.

   During the Reformation era, how did the church militant fare
spiritually? What lessons can we learn from its experience? Dan.
11:30-35 (compare Rev. 3:1-6).


   The valor of God's faithful witnesses, who braved privations, per-
secution, and death, is beyond human estimate. God strengthened
mortals who loved Jesus and His Word beyond all else to perform
deeds of omnipotence for the advancement of His kingdom.
   With flattering, deceptive promises, much like the honeyed talk of
modern ecumenism, the rulers of apostate Christendom deceived some
of the Reformers and lured them to compromise, thus stalling the
progress of the Reformation. (See The Great Controversy, pp. 118,
119.)

   With what promises does God assure us that His church mili-
tant will press forward to accomplish its task despite internal
weaknesses and outward opposition? Acts 15:13-17; Rom. 16:17-
20, 25-27.


   "Paul looks forward to the final victory predicted in Gen. 3:15,
which is not far off. This ultimate triumph over the forces of evil is
foreshadowed by every victory experienced by Christian believers
over temptation and deception. Paul is thinking of the victory he hopes
the Roman believers will enjoy by 'avoiding' the false teachers who
will seek to divide and confuse them."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol.
6, p. 651.

    How willing are you to work for the advancement of God's
 kingdom in the face of trial and enmity? What part does God's
 love have in maintaining strength for our task?

                                                                      81
Monday                                              December 2
THE OBJECT OF GOD'S SUPREME REGARD (Eph. 5:25-27).

  In what affectionate terms does God speak of His people, the
church? Ps. 45:10, 11, 13-17 (compare 2 Cor. 6:16-18).


    To our modern senses, the psalmist's language may seem too lavish
with praise and affection. But we must remember that God's thoughts
and ways are higher than ours. His love is an immeasurable, permeat-
ing power (Isa. 55:9). Moreover, He knows what He will perform in
the lives of His followers, and at times, He speaks of their glorifica-
tion as an accomplished fact (Rom. 8:29-31).
    "Enfeebled and defective as it may appear, the church is the one
object upon which God bestows in a special sense His supreme regard.
It is the theater of His grace, in which He delights to reveal His power
to transform hearts."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 12.

   Why is God's expression of love for His church not misplaced
or exaggerated? 1 Cor. 1:30; 6:9-11.


   The Corinthian church was riddled with schisms, immorality, legal
disputes between members, doctrinal errors, lack of tithing, gluttony
at the Lord's Supper, and a warped concept of spiritual gifts. Yet Paul
insisted that the Corinthians had been washed, sanctified, and justified
in Christ (1 Cor. 6:11).
    Paul was not justifying them in their sins, but reminding them of
their holy calling and seeking to reawaken their commitment to Christ
and the lifestyle that accompanies such a commitment. Moreover,
some in the church remained faithful to Christ. For all its problems,
Paul did not treat the church as hopelessly apostate. Their response to
his letter justified his confidence in them (2 Corinthians 7).
   "The Lord has an organized body through whom He will work.
There may be more than a score of Judases among them; there may be
a rash Peter who will under circumstances of trial deny his Lord; there
may be persons represented by John . . . [who] may have a zeal that
would destroy men's lives. . . . But the great Teacher seeks to give
lessons of instruction to correct these existing evils. He is doing the
same today with His church."—Reflecting Christ, p. 199.

    What lessons of instruction might the great Teacher be trying
 to give to the church today? To you as a member of that church?
    Because the church is the object of Christ's supreme regard,
 what should be our attitude to the church—even when we see
 faults and weaknesses?

THE GOOD FIGHT (1 Tim. 6:12).

   To what active warfare does Christ call His followers? 1 Tim.
6:12 (compare 2 Tim. 2:2-5).


   This warfare is not a hostile encounter with our fellow humans, but
the conquest of self, the subduing of our hearts to God's love. This is
the hardest battle we can wage and the noblest victory we can win.
The Lord can make us more than conquerors (Rom. 8:37).
   We are also to contend earnestly for the faith that was once de-
livered unto the saints. We are to stand up for the truth as it is in Jesus
and help rescue others from the enemy camp. All this calls for a
determined warfare, unhampered by a belligerent, ill-tempered spirit.

  Review the special armaments the Lord has provided for us so
we will be triumphant. Eph. 6:10-18.


   We must put on the whole armor of God. We are to consecrate our
entire lives to Him without reservation. Only by unconditional surren-
der to Christ will we enjoy unconditional victory over Satan, our arch
foe.
   "The Lord has honored us by choosing us as His soldiers. Let us
fight bravely for Him, maintaining the right in every transaction. . . .
As you strive for the victory over your own inclinations, He will help
you by His Holy Spirit to be circumspect in every action."—Ellen G.
White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1119.

   Rightly employed, our Christian "weapons" will never be em-
ployed to injure or disgrace anyone. How is it possible to be an
active, energetic warrior for Christ without being combative and
overbearing? 1 Cor. 9:19-27; Col. 3:1-16.


   "Genuine faith always works by love. When you look to Calvary it
is not to quiet your soul in the nonperformance of duty . . . but to
create faith in Jesus, faith that will work, purifying the soul from the
slime of selfishness. . . . Every soul is required to fight the fight of
faith. If one is a follower of Christ, he cannot be sharp in deal, he
cannot be hardhearted, devoid of sympathy. He cannot be coarse in
his speech. He cannot be full of pomposity and self-esteem. He cannot
be overbearing, nor can he use harsh words, and censure and con-
demn."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6,
p. 1111.

                                                                       83
Wednesday                                            December 4
TAKE HEED TO THYSELF (1 Tim. 4:16).

   One of the great challenges of the church militant is to uphold a
high standard while at the same time avoiding a spirit of condemna-
tion and hostile reform. Yet neither can we advocate love to the point
of permissiveness. "True charity is too pure to cover an unconfessed
sin. . . . We are to make no compromise with evil."—The Acts of the
Apostles, p. 555.

  Where is the great work of reform to begin? 1 Tim. 4:16 (com-
pare Deut. 4:9).


    We can hardly overemphasize the need for humble, daily self-
examination to see that we remain in the faith of Jesus Christ. Those
who desire to rescue others from the swift-running current of sin must
be sure that their own feet are firmly planted on safe ground. Many
zealous reformers have assumed that because they are fighting the
battles of the Lord, they are immune to Satan. Meanwhile, others,
whose own positions may be questioned, painstakingly subject people
to their own special theological litmus tests, hardly realizing that God
alone is the judge of a balanced, definitive presentation of the gospel.
    Let us prove all things and continually feast upon the Word of God,
giving one another opportunity to grow in the understanding of truths
that are difficult to express fully. None of us can ever expect to state
the truth with such precision and beauty that all honest souls will
comprehend it perfectly. Understanding truth is the fruit of grace and
of each believer's personal fellowship with Christ and His Word
(1 Cor. 8:1-3; 13:8-13).
    In 1 Timothy 4:16, "[Paul] asserts the primary importance of de-
pendable Christian character as a qualification for service to the church.
Acquaintance with the teachings of the church is important, but this
knowledge can never compensate for a questionable reputation. The
most winsome argument for Christianity is not unanswerable logic but
the fragrance of a Christlike life. Sincere seekers for truth are not
interested in theory, but in a working philosophy of life that can solve
their problems and help them to overcome their weaknesses. When
non-Christians who are honest in heart see that the gospel changes
selfish, vain, timeserving men into pure, unselfish Christians they will
be drawn to the Christ of the gospel."—SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 7, p. 307.

    How can we avoid judging others while at the same time
 discerning and clinging to pure truth as we test all things?

Thursday                                            December 5
SATAN'S OPPOSITION, GOD'S PROTECTION (Rev. 12:17).

   However numerous the arguments regarding various aspects of
truth, we must never forget that our chief foe is Satan, who seeks to
keep within the church the spirit of controversy and conflict. Unity is
not a matter of small consequence (Rom. 15:1-7; 1 Cor. 1:10; Phil.
1:27-29). We must prayerfully seek unity based on the Word of God.

  What group of people is under special assault, and how do they
overcome? Rev. 12:10, 11, 17.


   While it is true in a general sense that Satan walks about like a
roaring lion indiscriminately seeking his prey (1 Peter 5:8), it is no
less true that he targets those who obey God's law and testimony. But
in Christ, their spiritual defense is sure. The Lord Himself strengthens
them to repulse Satan's onslaughts.

   What promise of protection does the Lord extend to His faith-
ful people, and on what condition? Ps. 18:29-38; 91:9-16; 144:1, 2.


   God bids us to be always alert for the enemy. If we trust God, He
will never abandon us. His angels stand at the ready to guide and
protect us. "As His children draw near to Him for protection from evil,
in pity and love He lifts up for them a standard against the enemy.
Touch them not, He says; for they are Mine. I have graven them upon
the palms of My hands."—Prophets and Kings, p. 571.
   "Christ desires nothing so much as to redeem His heritage from the
dominion of Satan. But before we are delivered from Satan's power
without, we must be delivered from his power within."—Christ's
Object Lessons, pp. 174, 175.
   "The life of Christ was a life charged with a divine message of the
love of God, and He longed intensely to impart this love to others in
rich measure. Compassion beamed from His countenance, and His
conduct was characterized by grace and humility, love and truth.
Every member of His church militant must manifest the same quali-
ties, if he would join the church triumphant."—Our High Calling,
p. 366.

    Ours is an aggressive warfare, yet we are to be a people of
 peace, in whom dwells the peace that passes all understanding.
 Stay close to the Captain of your salvation.
    How should the principles of this day's lesson influence our
 behavior when controversy breaks out in the church?

                                                                     85
Friday                                               December 6
FURTHER STUDY: Read Isaiah 62. Also read "The Object of His
Supreme Regard" and "The Church the Property of God" in Testimo-
nies to Ministers, pp. 15-19, 21, 22. Consider the resourcefulness of
God's love and the power of His grace to transform weak and unwor-
thy beings into "a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices accept-
able to God through Jesus Christ" (1 Peter 2:5, NIV). You might also
want to read the chapter entitled "Tares" in Christ's Object Lessons,
pp. 70-75.

   "Some people seem to think that upon entering the church they
will . . . meet only with those who are pure and perfect. They are
zealous in their faith, and when they see faults in church members,
they say, 'We left the world in order to have no association with evil
characters, but the evil is here also'; and they ask, as did the servants
in the parable, 'From whence then hath it tares?' But we need not be
thus disappointed, for the Lord has not warranted us in coming to the
conclusion that the church is perfect; and all our zeal will not be
successful in making the church militant as pure as the church trium-
phant. The Lord forbids us to proceed in any violent way against those
whom we think erring, and we are not to deal out excommunications
and denunciations to those who are faulty."—Testimonies to Minis-
ters, p. 47.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Why is the portrait of God's church as His royal crown and
     His holy bride (Isa. 62:3, 5) not excessive? (See Isa. 40:1, 2;
     Rev. 7:14.)

   2. How can Christ acknowledge the visible church as His own
      while "tares" and "bad fish" still remain in it? (See Matt.
      13:24-30, 33-43, 47-49; 2 Tim. 2:19-21.)

   3. How can we "cleanse the camp from Achans" and yet avoid
      the urge to separate the wheat from the chaff? (See 1 Tim.
      5:20-22; 2 Tim. 4:1, 2; Titus 2:13-15.)

SUMMARY: Encompassed with internal weakness and outward op-
position, the church militant has ever been on the march toward
fulfilling Christ's purpose. That purpose is to have a people who
faithfully reflect His character and do His bidding. They remain the
earthly object of Christ's supreme regard. He invites us to unite
through the power of His blood and Word personally appropriated in
our lives. Through His grace He protects and perfects His church.

      @IF              Guerrilla Finds God, part 1
                                  Romulo Gemino
           I joined a band of guerrilla soldiers in the Philippines when I was
       only 10 years old. I learned to fight, to trust no one, to rely only on
       myself. The guerrillas carried on their hit-and-run warfare from
       hiding places in the forested mountains of the central Philippines.
       Violence dominated our lives; killing had little meaning. Eventually
       I became commander of the guerrillas in the National People's Army.
       Religion had no part in my life. I thought God was for the weak; I
       was strong and fearless.
           One Sunday we walked into a church, machine guns loaded, and
       forced the congregation stand along the church's aisle and place their
       Bibles on the floor. Then we made them walk on their Bibles and
       leave the church. Shoving a gun at the pastor, we ordered him to lead
       the way, and the congregation followed. The people scattered like
       bats as they stepped outside the church. What a sight to see these
       poor people run for their lives!
           But I heard a sound inside the church and saw an old woman lying
       under one of the pews, sobbing and clutching her Bible to her chest. I
       ordered her to get up and leave, but she would not go. Her refusal
       irritated me, and I pointed the barrel of my gun at her chest. Still she
       would not move. I pulled the trigger.
           Killing and looting, striking fear into the hearts of peasants, made
       us cold and heartless, but not omnipotent. Eventually I was captured
       and charged with rebellion against the government and murder. I was
       sentenced to death for killing 282 people.
           With two other men I stood before a firing squad at the edge of a
       freshly dug ditch. Suddenly I felt powerless. As the soldiers aimed
       their guns at us, I called out to every saint whose name I could
       remember. Gunshots rang out, and the two other men fell to the
       ground. I waited, still praying. But the bullets never came.
           A soldier grabbed me and led me into the prison, where guards
                                  questioned me for hours about the the guer-
                                  rilla army. Cooperate, I was told, and I might
                                  live; refuse, and I would die.

       The Remnant Church




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Isa. 37:31, 32; Jer. 31:7-11;
Joel 2:32; Zeph. 3:13-19; Rom. 11:1-5.

  MEMORY TEXT: "And the dragon was wroth with the woman,
  and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep
  the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus
  Christ" (Revelation 12:17).

   KEY QUESTIONS: Who are God's remnant people? And how
can you be one of them?

   THE RULER HAD ISSUED THE DECREE. And as it reached
the corners of his realm, the children of God sang and laughed. They
could go home at last! Many of them, including Daniel, had studied
the prophecies, beseeching God to intervene on their behalf. He had
heard their prayers! Soon, approximately 50,000 of them chose to
restore their homeland. Their friends who stayed behind showered
them with precious objects to assist them with the task.
   "The long journey across the desert wastes was accomplished in
safety, and the happy company, grateful to God for His many mercies,
at once undertook the work of re-establishing that which had been
broken down and destroyed."—Prophets and Kings, p. 560.
   As quickly as they could, they built an altar and reestablished the
holy services that had been discontinued when Jerusalem was de-
stroyed. They were a faithful remnant, pleased to do God's will. It is
readily possible to imagine them singing the words of Psalm 126:1-3.
As you study this week's lesson, look for comparisons between this
remnant and the remnant that will work and rejoice during earth's last
days.

THE IDENTITY OF THE REMNANT (Rev. 12:17; 14:12).

   The biblical concept of the remnant deals with any group of faithful
people who endure trial, apostasy, persecution, or some form of ca-
lamity. Noah and his immediate family survived the Flood. A remnant
came out of Ur of Chaldees with Abram. A remnant did not apostatize
in the days of Israel's and Judah's kings. The remnant in the last days
will remain loyal to God, rejecting the mark of the beast (Sunday
observance) despite persecution.

   What proportion of people prove faithful to God? Matt. 7:13,
14 (compare Prov. 20:6).


   Genuine conversion and righteousness are rare, not because they
are so difficult to obtain, but because most people allow themselves to
be overcome by pride and selfishness.
   "If we ever attain unto holiness, it will be through the renunciation
of self and the reception of the mind of Christ. Pride and self-
sufficiency must be crucified. Are we willing to pay the price required
of us? Are we willing to have our will brought into perfect conformity
to the will of God? Until we are willing, the transforming grace of God
cannot be manifest upon us."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing,
p. 143.

  What three things in particular characterize the remnant? Rev.
12:17; 14:12.


   Faith of Jesus. The Greek of Revelation 14:12 may indicate "faith
in Jesus" (J. B. Phillips; NASB). Such faith and the observing of
God's commandments are major features of the Christian life. God's
commandments reflect His character and describe His righteous
standard. Jesus lived to show us what God is like. And in His strength,
we are able to obey God, reflecting His image.
   "The remnant church thus honors the commandments of God, and
observes them, not in any legalistic sense but as a revelation of the
character of God and of Christ, who dwells in the heart of the true
believer."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 833.
   God's last-day remnant keep the fourth commandment. The Sab-
bath is a sign of God's creative power and "the witness to His claim
upon man's reverence and homage. The wicked will be distinguished
by their efforts to tear down the Creator's memorial."—Our Father
Cares, p. 228.

THE CHARACTER OF THE REMNANT (Rev. 14:1-5; Matt. 24:13).

  Describe the character qualities possessed by God's remnant.
Zeph. 3:13; Rev. 14:1-5.


   It is not just the beliefs of the remnant that constitute their identity
and strength, but the quality of their religious experience. Integrity
and pure conduct, the fruit of intimate fellowship with Christ, distin-
guish the remnant from the mass of self-deluded "Christians" whose
religious experience is a tissue of evasions and lies. The remnant
experience a joyful religion, expressed in unselfish labor for the salva-
tion of others.

   List other qualities that the remnant possess. Matt. 24:12, 13;
Titus 2:11-14.


   Persecution will plague God's last-day remnant (Rev. 12:17). But
they will exhibit a perseverance sustained by their attachment to
Christ and dependence on His blood and Word (Rev. 12:11). They
will be fortified with the whole armor of God (Eph. 6:10-18).
   The Bible is full of examples of those who persevered. "Even the
fear of death could not make the fainting David drink of the water of
Bethlehem, to obtain which, valiant men had risked their lives. The
gaping lions' den could not keep Daniel from his daily prayers, nor
could the fiery furnace induce Shadrach and his companions to fall
down before the idol which Nebuchadnezzar set up. . . . Mark the
character of Joseph. Virtue was severely tested, but its triumph was
complete."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 43. We also think of Hannah,
Abraham, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Jesus, and John the
Revelator on Patmos.
   The remnant's experience will parallel that of the apostle Paul,
described in 2 Corinthians 6:3-10. And, as they fight the battles of the
Lord, not as aggressors, but as able defenders of the faith and libera-
tors of Satan's unwilling captives, they will keep steadily in view "the
blessed hope—the glorious appearing of our great God and Saviour,
Jesus Christ" (Titus 2:13, NIV).

    Think about the following statement in relation to Revelation
14:1-12. "Every addition to the church should be one more
 agency for the carrying out of the great plan of redemption. The
 entire church, acting as one, blending in perfect union, is to be a
 living, active missionary agency, moved and controlled by the
 Holy Spirit."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 47.

GOD'S SPECIAL GIFT TO THE REMNANT (Rev. 19:10).

   As we have seen, the remnant are distinguished by their obedi-
ence to God's commandments and their having the testimony of
Jesus (Rev. 12:17). How does Scripture define "the testimony of
Jesus"? Rev. 19:10 (compare 22:9).


   Seventh-day Adventists believe that the Spirit of Prophecy is mani-
fest in our time in the writings and ministry of Ellen White. (For a
more thorough study of this subject, which, owing to space con-
straints, cannot be supplied in the quarterly, we recommend Frank B.
Holbrook's article "The Biblical Basis for a Modern Prophet" and
Roger Coon's book A Gift of Light, available from the White Estate.)
   Ellen White's writings harmonize with Scripture and give a full,
balanced exposition to Bible prophecy, a subject that Jesus empha-
sized the importance of understanding (Matt. 24:15; Rev. 1:3). The
fruit of her counsel has helped us as a church to maintain organiza-
tional and theological integrity. The guidance of her pen also has
helped us to consolidate as a movement, break down cultural preju-
dice, expand our vision of missions, and undertake a vast work in
publishing, education, welfare ministry, and medicine.
    From a theological standpoint, Ellen White's writings illuminate
our understanding of the great controversy between Christ and Satan,
a theme woven throughout Scripture and culminating in the final
triumph of God's love.
    Of her own writings Ellen White said: "Little heed is given to the
Bible, and the Lord has given a lesser light to lead men and women to
the greater light."—Evangelism, p. 257. Thus, her writings magnify
Christ and His Word and expose Satan and his lies.
    Because her writings teach us to love Bible truth and detect and
spurn every type of delusion, Satan has incited an aversion to the
testimonies. Ellen White prophesied that this would happen: "There
will be a hatred kindled against the testimonies which is satanic. The
workings of Satan will be to unsettle the faith of the churches in them,
for this reason: Satan cannot have so clear a track to bring in his
deceptions and bind up souls in his delusions if the warnings and
 reproofs and counsels of the Spirit of God are heeded."—Selected
 Messages, book 1, p. 48. (See also "The Nature and Influence of the
Testimonies" in Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 654-672.)

    Do you want your love for Christ and the Bible to grow?
 Reading Ellen White's books will enrich your spiritual life. Since
 the Holy Spirit inspired Ellen White's messages, what attitude
 to the Holy Spirit is manifested by rejection of the messages?

                                                                    91

VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE (Rev. 18:1-5; Micah 2:12, 13).

   Jude forewarned that the church would become increasingly blighted
with self-serving pretenders who would preach a false gospel (Jude 2-
4, 7-13). This degeneracy has progressed almost nonstop since then.
All forms of vice and immorality find a secure home in apostate
churches. Sexual disorders, alcoholism, and child molestation occur
among pastors and priests. It seems that addiction to violent, lewd
entertainment abounds almost as much among some churchgoers as
among those to whom religion is nothing. It also appears that the
incidence of gluttony, gossip, greed, divorce, and enslavement to
fashions is nearly as great among some professed believers as among
nonbelievers.
   Yet to many other Christians, Jesus is their Lord and Saviour. God
desires His visible, organized remnant church, the Seventh-day
Adventist Church, to shine forth "fair as the moon and clear as the
sun." Others can follow that beacon into pure Christian fellowship.

   In the days of Elijah, how "visible" were the remnant? 1 Kings
19:12-18. In these final days, how will God's invisible remnant,
scattered throughout the world, become united and visible? Rev.
18:1-5; Micah 2:12, 13.


   "Among earth's inhabitants, scattered in every land, there are those
who have not bowed the knee to Baal. Like the stars of heaven, which
appear only at night, these faithful ones will shine forth when darkness
covers the earth and gross darkness the people. . . . God has in reserve
a firmament of chosen ones that will yet shine forth amidst the dark-
ness, revealing clearly to an apostate world the transforming power of
obedience to His law. . . .
   "Then let . . . everyone have a heart of flesh, a heart of tender
sympathy, a heart that, like the heart of Christ, reaches out for the
salvation of a lost world."—Prophets and Kings, pp. 188, 189.
   Since the Reformation, God's truth has been progressively re-
stored. That restoration is consummated in His final remnant, who are
guided by the law and testimony of Jesus (Rev. 12:17). The remnant
appeal to members of fallen churches and other religious systems to
follow the Lord (Rev. 18:4). Jesus said: "I have other sheep, that are
not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will heed my voice.
So there shall be one flock, one shepherd" (John 10:16, RSV).

    Resolve that you will cleave to Christ and live by the Word He
 calls you to follow.

REACTION AND INFLUENCE (Rev. 12:17; Joel 2:32).

  How do the majority of people react toward the children of
God? Matt. 24:9; Rev. 12:17.


   "The decree that will finally go forth against the remnant people of
God will be very similar to that issued by Ahasuerus against the Jews
[see Esther 3]. Today the enemies of the true church see in the little
company keeping the Sabbath commandment, a Mordecai at the gate.
The reverence of God's people for His law, is a constant rebuke to
those who have cast off the fear of the Lord, and are trampling on His
Sabbath.
   "Satan will arouse indignation against the minority who refuse to
accept popular customs and traditions. Men of position and reputation
will join with the lawless and the vile to take counsel against the
people of God. . . . To secure popularity and patronage, legislators will
yield to the demand for Sunday laws. But those who fear God, cannot
accept an institution that violates a precept of the Decalogue. On this
battlefield will be fought the last great conflict . . . between truth and
error. And we are not left in doubt as to the issue. Today, as in the days
of Esther and Mordecai, the Lord will vindicate His truth and His
 people."—Prophets and Kings, pp. 605, 606.

  Describe the positive effect the message and work of the rem-
nant have on the world. Isa. 60:1-5; Joel 2:28-32.


   The truth, as it is shared by the remnant in words and deeds, will
work under the power of the latter rain to separate multitudes of souls
from Babylon's influence.
   When tragedies such as hurricanes, famines, earthquakes, or floods
devastate any given part of the world, generous people everywhere
rally to support the victims with bundles of food, clothing, and house-
hold utensils. Sin is the greatest tragedy of all, causing far more
serious devastation than any natural calamity. As stewards of God's
grace and truth, His children will rally to provide relief for the "refu-
gees" from Babylon. These "victims" will not be cast adrift, but will
become part of the remnant church, which keeps the commandments
of God and has the testimony of Jesus.

    Consider afresh the privilege and responsibility of devoting
 your life to Christ and sharing His gospel with the world. Be-
 cause this is our task, consider the need of having a completely
 biblical understanding of the gospel.

                                                                      93
Friday                                          December 13
FURTHER STUDY: Read Zechariah 3 and the chapter "Joshua and
the Angel" in Prophets and Kings, pp. 582-592. Learn from Joshua's
experience how you can be victorious over sin and fruitful in God's
service.

    To understand better the role of Ellen White in the Seventh-day
Adventist Church, read "The Remnant Church and the Spirit of Proph-
ecy" in Symposium on Revelation, book 2, pp. 295-333, published by
the Biblical Research Institute, General Conference of Seventh-day
Adventists.
    Occasionally, some have taken the position that the Holy Spirit
calls the remnant to depart from the Seventh-day Adventist Church
and form a separate, "pure" organization, wholly committed to the
straight testimony. But consider the following statement by Ellen
White:
    "God has not given them any such burden of labor. They would tear
down that which God would restore by the Laodicean mes-
sage. . . . The Lord lays upon no man a message that will discourage
and dishearten the church. He reproves, He rebukes, He chastens; but
it is only that He may restore and approve at last."—Testimonies to
Ministers, pp. 22, 23.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Read 2 Chronicles 30:1-13, Isaiah 10:22, Romans 9:27-29,
     and 11:2-5. Reflect on the lessons we, as God's last-day
     remnant, can learn from these texts.

   2. Read Isaiah 37:31, 32. Discuss the meaning of the phrase
      "the zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this" (NIV).
      What part does God's zeal play in our redemption? (See
      also Isa. 9:7.)

  3. As a member of God's last-day remnant, what gives you
     hope and courage? How can you pass on this spirit of hope
     and courage to your fellow church members and to your
     unbelieving neighbors and friends?

SUMMARY: The remnant are God's faithful people who love Him
and therefore obey Him. Under Satan's instigation, the whole world
will seek to destroy God's remnant people in the last days. But under
the anointing of God's Spirit, this embattled group of believers will
arise to proclaim the everlasting gospel with purity, power, courage,
and love. When this occurs, many in the enemy camp will separate
from Babylon to join them, thus becoming part of the remnant.

                        Guerrilla Finds God, part 2
                                  Romulo Gemino

           The guards had just saved me from the firing squad, but I knew
       they were not interested in my life. They wanted information on the
       guerrilla organization I led. They didn't mince words. If I lied, I died;
       if I cooperated, perhaps they could recommend clemency.
           After hours of questioning, the soldiers pushed me into a tiny
       prison cell, so small I could not stand up or lie down. I had no bed to
       sleep on, no blanket to protect me from the dampness or the mosqui-
       toes that were ever present.
           Isolated from other prisoners, I learned that I was sentenced to die
       after all. Just as soldiers were preparing to carry out my execution,
       the Philippine president commuted my sentence to life in prison.
           For three years that damp, dark cell was my home. The mosqui-
       toes were my constant companions. I had a lot of time to think about
       life and death.
           Then one day I heard beautiful singing. I asked the guard to bring
       the singers to see me. They came to my cell and sang for me. I learned
       that they were Seventh-shy Adventists who held religious services in
       the jail. Right there I heard the good news of salvation. I accepted
       Jesus Christ as my Saviour. I was still a prisoner, but I was forgiven-
       -and free in Christ. I was baptized inside the jail.
           I learned how to give Bible studies and spoke to many other
       prisoners about Christ. Sometimes prisoners threatened me, and some-
       times I was afraid, but with the help of Adventist laymen, we led
       many prisoners to spiritual freedom in Christ. We eventually started a
       church, right inside the prison. I was honored to become an elder in
       that church.
           In March 1992 Philippines' new president granted amnesty to
       many political prisoners, and I was released from prison. A month
       later a pastor from the 1000 Missionary Movement asked me to join
       this movement and work for other prisoners.
                                     By God's grace, I am back in prison, not
                                  serving time, but serving God full time. By
                                  God's grace I will find many who want true
                                  freedom in Jesus.

                                    Romulo Gemino is working with the 1000

        The Church—Shaken
             and Sifted




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Luke 3:16, 17; 1 Cor. 15:57,
58; Heb. 12:25-29.

   MEMORY TEXT: "For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the
   house of Israel among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a
   sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth" (Amos
   9:9).

   KEY QUESTIONS: What are the shaking and sifting of the mod-
ern church? Why does it occur? And what will be the results?

   TOSSED AND STAGGERING. The ancient method of separat-
ing grain from its encasing chaff involved shaking and sifting it in a
sieve. As the grain kernels were tossed upward, the wind would blow
the chaff away, and the kernels, which were heavier than chaff, would
fall back into the sieve. The sieve also would be shaken repeatedly and
the grains sifted by hand. Dirt, pebbles, and smaller particles of chaff
would fall through the sieve, leaving only the grain.
   The phrase I will sift in our memory text literally means "I will toss
about," or "I will cause to stagger." Amos is prophesying that God
would cause Israel to be scattered among the nations and "there tossed
about, as it were, in the 'sieve' of affliction and persecution that it
might be determined through this trial who will remain loyal followers
of God."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 983.
   This purifying process finds its spiritual counterpart today in the
trials, temptations, and tests of life. As you study this week's lesson,
consider how a knowledge of the shaking can draw you closer to
Christ, thereby increasing your strength to overcome.

WHAT THE SHAKING AND SIFTING ARE (Luke 22:31, 32).

   From the Memory Text for this week, we learn that God sifts
through our lives to separate us from all dross. Who else does a
sifting work and why? Luke 22:31, 33, 34. What is Christ's coun-
sel regarding this sifting? Luke 22:40.


    How confident Peter was! Do you know someone like him? Per-
haps yourself? If someone is so emphatic about never doing a particu-
lar thing, that is often the act against which he or she must guard.
Usually the seemingly most secure areas of a stronghold are left
unprotected in order for the defenders to stabilize weaker areas. Thus
it is not unusual for the enemy to attack at these secure areas. Our
spiritual foe often attacks in this way.
    "Pray that you will not fall into temptation" (Luke 22:40, NIV).
The Greek word for "temptation" means "trial" or "test." If Peter had
been more attentive to Christ's counsel to pray, he would have been
given the strength to acknowledge his Saviour. Much of the shaking
and sifting we undergo comes because we are too self-confident and
complacent.

   What did Christ do for Peter that He will also do for us? Luke
22:32 (compare Rom. 8:34; Heb. 7:25). How does Christ's interest
in our welfare enable us to respond? Heb. 4:14-16.


   "I have prayed for you" (Luke 22:32, NIV). "What a comfort to
know that the Master takes so personal an interest in the problems and
temptations of us as individuals!"—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5,
p. 868.
   If we value Christ's intercessory prayers for us and also pray in
harmony with His will, Satan's temptations will only bring us closer
to our Saviour until we are beyond Satan's reach. "From grateful
hearts, from lips touched with holy fire, let the glad song ring out,
Christ is risen! He lives to make intercession for us. Grasp this hope,
and it will hold the soul like a sure, tried anchor. Believe, and thou
shalt see the glory of God."—The Desire of Ages, p. 794.

    During the closing days of earth's history, the church and the
 world will be shaken mightily. How can you improve your prayer
 life so that you will not find yourself in Peter's position? How
 else can we ensure that we will not be shaken out of Christ's last-
 day church?


                                                                   97
Monday                                            December 16
CAUSES FOR THE SHAKING, PART 1 (Rev. 3:14-17; 1 Cor.
11:19).

    The shaking is not an arbitrary decree on God's part. The Bible and
Spirit of Prophecy give distinct reasons for it. We will study these
reasons in the lessons for today and tomorrow. It is especially impor-
tant to understand this matter so we will not be among the people
sifted out.

  What is one basic reason for the shaking? Rev. 3:14-17 (com-
pare Matt. 25:1-14).


    Self-satisfaction and a presumptuous sense of security, which breed
indifference, cause many to be shaken out, especially when they or the
church receive trials that they have no inner strength to bear. Such
people have few spiritual struggles, because they have no idea what it
means to "press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has
called" them (Phil. 3:14, NIV). When sacrifice and trial are called for,
they depart from the faith, offended and dismayed.
    "Lukewarm Christianity preserves enough of the form, and even of
the content of the gospel, to dull the perceptive powers of the spirit
and renders men oblivious to the earnest effort necessary to the attain-
ment of the high ideal of a victorious life in Christ. The typical
Laodicean Christian is content with things as they are and proud of the
little progress he has made. It is almost impossible to convince him of
his great need and of how far he is from the goal of perfection."—SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 761.
    Frequently associated with this spiritual lukewarmness is an obses-
sion with worldly gain. "You say, 'I am rich; I have acquired wealth
and do not need a thing.' But you do not realize that you are wretched,
pitiful, poor, blind and naked" (Rev. 3:17, NIV).

  Read 1 Corinthians 11:19 and Ephesians 4:14. How do "every
wind of teaching" (NW) and "deceitful scheming" (NIV) cause the
shaking?


   False teachings that undermine the power of truth have been intro-
duced into the church since its inception (Acts 20:29, 30). Opinions
that question God's Word will continue to enchant unstable believers
until Christ returns. "The mighty shaking has commenced and will go
on, and all will be shaken out who are not willing to take a bold and
unyielding stand for the truth and to sacrifice for God and His cause."
—Early Writings, p. 50.

CAUSES FOR THE SHAKING, PART 2 (John 6:55-71; Matt. 24:9,
10).

   What third major cause brings on the shaking? John 6:55-71
(compare Gal. 4:16; Isa. 30:8-17).


   "I asked the meaning of the shaking I had seen, and was shown that it
would be caused by the straight testimony called forth by the counsel of
the True Witness to the Laodiceans. This will have its effect upon the
heart of the receiver, and will lead him to exalt the standard and pour
forth the straight truth. Some will not bear this straight testimony. They
will rise up against it, and this will cause a shaking among God's
people."—Testimonies, vol. 1, p. 181.

  Describe the fourth major reason for the shaking. Matt. 13:20-
22; 24:9, 10.


   "Hated by all nations because of me" (Matt. 24:9, NIV). Those
who choose not to follow their Creator and Saviour are offended by
the indictment implied by the lives of Christ's disciples. Christians,
therefore, should expect misunderstandings and persecution.
   When the church prospers, it is easy to profess belief. But when the
church members personally, or the church corporately, must pass
through hardship, how quickly their profession turns to dust and their
hatred multiplies toward those who, through God's grace, stand firm.
   "The time is not far distant when the test will come to every soul.
The mark of the beast [the false Sabbath] will be urged upon us. Those
who have step by step yielded to worldly demands and conformed to
worldly customs will not find it a hard matter to yield to the powers
that be, rather than subject themselves to derision, insult, threatened
imprisonment, and death. The contest is between the commandments
of God and the commandments of men. In this time the gold will be
separated from the dross in the church. True godliness will be clearly
distinguished from the appearance and tinsel of it. Many a star that we
have admired for its brilliancy will then go out in darkness. Chaff like
a cloud will be borne away on the wind, even from places where we
see only floors of rich wheat."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 81.

    Pray for strength to meet the smaller tests so when the bigger
 ones arrive, you will be able to stand firm. Apart from under-
 standing and believing Bible truth, what experience is vital if we
 are to stand firm for Christ?


                                                                       99
Wednesday                                          December 18
EFFECTS OF THE SHAKING (Luke 3:16, 17).

   How will the manifestation of Christ's righteousness among us
affect those who love the truth? Isa. 52:7-9.


   Deliverance and peace are a joyful message. The deliverance men-
tioned in these verses was first for literal Israel from their oppressors.
But such liberation also represents deliverance from sin, deliverance
through the Messiah. The good tidings referred to thus become the
gospel story, the triumph of which proves that God, not Satan, reigns.
   What time is it? "The time has come for a thorough reformation to
take place. When this reformation begins, the spirit of prayer will
actuate every believer and will banish from the church the spirit of
discord and strife. Those who have not been living in Christian fellow-
ship will draw close to one another. One member working in right
lines will lead other members to unite with him in making intercession
for the revelation of the Holy Spirit. There will be no confusion,
because all will be in harmony with the mind of the Spirit."—Testimo-
nies, vol. 8, p. 251.
   The result will be the outpouring of Heaven's blessings on the
church—in "good measure, pressed down, shaken together and run-
ning over" (Luke 6:38, NIV).

  How will this same revelation affect the rebellious in the church
and the world? Luke 3:16, 17 (compare Isa. 17:4-6, 12, 13).


   John the Baptist uses the common sight of sifting and shaking grain
to symbolize a spiritual shaking. But it is a shaking professed Chris-
tians can meet with confidence as long as they are clothed with
Christ's righteousness.
   "Chaff like a cloud will be borne away on the wind, even from
places where we see only floors of rich wheat. All who assume the
ornaments of the sanctuary, but are not clothed with Christ's right-
eousness, will appear in the shame of their own nakedness."
—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 81.

   Study Luke 3:16, 17 in relationship to verses 7-14. What do
verses 7-14 tell us about the nature of Christ's righteousness?
How do verses 7-14 inform us regarding the basis of the sifting
referred to in verse 17?
    What steps can you begin taking now to be sure that the
 shaking will consolidate your relationship with Christ?

THE SHAKING CONSUMMATED (Amos 9:9-11).

   How will the shaking ultimately affect the church? Amos 9:
9-11.


   The church is not destroyed by the shaking; those members who
remain do so because of their relationship with Christ. Thus the way is
paved for the church militant to become the church triumphant. (See
lesson 13.)
   Appearances do not mean much. "The church may appear as
about to fall, but it does not fall. It remains, while the sinners in Zion
will be sifted out—the chaff separated from the precious wheat. This
is a terrible ordeal, but nevertheless it must take place. None but those
who have been overcoming by the blood of the Lamb and the word of
their testimony will be found with the loyal and true, without spot or
stain of sin, without guile in their mouths. We must be divested of our
self-righteousness and arrayed in the righteousness of Christ."
—Selected Messages, book 2, p. 380.
    Understanding that the sifting is necessary shields us from a false
concept of the shaking, a concept that Satan very much wants us to
believe: "You will take passages in the Testimonies that speak of the
close of probation, of the shaking among God's people, and you will
talk of a coming out from this people of a purer, holier people that will
arise. Now all this pleases the enemy."—Selected Messages, book 1,
p. 179.

  What strength will God's people have during even the most
advanced stages of the shaking? Ps. 46:1-5; Heb. 12:26-28.


   "When the storm of persecution really breaks upon us, the true
sheep will hear the true Shepherd's voice. Self-denying efforts will be
put forth to save the lost, and many who have strayed from the fold
will come back to follow the great Shepherd. The people of God will
draw together and present to the enemy a united front. In view of the
common peril, strife for supremacy will cease; there will be no disput-
ing as to who shall be accounted greatest. . . . Then will the message of
the third angel swell to a loud cry, and the whole earth will be
lightened with the glory of the Lord."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 401.
   "Notwithstanding the agencies combined against the truth, a large
number take their stand upon the Lord's side."—The Great Contro-
versy, p. 612.



                                                                     101
Friday                                            December 20
FURTHER STUDY: Read "The Shaking" in Last Day Events,
pp. 172-182. Consider what susceptibilities and weaknesses you may
have that would endanger you during this time.

   Find in Ezekiel 37:1-14 how the Holy Spirit can give you victory
during the shaking.

   "Fellow Christian, Satan knows your weakness; therefore cling to
Jesus. Abiding in God's love, you may stand every test. The right-
eousness of Christ alone can give you power to stem the tide of evil
that is sweeping over the world. Bring faith into your experience.
Faith lightens every burden, relieves every weariness. Providences
that are now mysterious you may solve by continued trust in God.
Walk by faith in the path He marks out. Trials will come, but go
forward. This will strengthen your faith and fit you for service. The
records of sacred history are written, not merely that we may read and
wonder, but that the same faith which wrought in God's servants of
old may work in us. In no less marked manner will the Lord work
now, wherever there are hearts of faith to be channels of His power."
—Prophets and Kings, p. 175.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Why is an accurate knowledge of doctrine not sufficient to
     fortify us against deception and apostasy? (See James 1:22-
     27; 1 John 3:11-20.)

   2. A popular speaker in the church departs from the faith that
      he once taught. You were often blessed by the messages of
      this speaker. Some fellow believers who were once a strong
      encouragement to you leave the church to join a Sunday-
      keeping fellowship in which they joyfully declare them-
      selves to be "set free" in Christ. Meanwhile, your local
      congregation is confused and divided on some basic doctri-
      nal issues. What will keep you from being shaken out of the
      church? (See Ps. 125:1, 2.)

SUMMARY: God purifies His church through the shaking. Laodicean
lukewarmness, heresies, the straight testimony of the True Witness,
and persecution are the principal causes for the shaking. But the
church does not disintegrate. Instead, the falsehearted leave its fellow-
ship, while the consecrated remain, their experience deepened and
purified by the trial.

           Seeking Searching Hearts in China
                           Eugene Hsu
    Wu Lan Ying is a 72-year-old retired teacher in China. She
may have retired from teaching school, but not from teaching
others about Christ. Born into a Christian family, her father and
uncle were among the first to become Adventists in her home
village. She married and bore six children before her husband died
at age 28.
    Wu Lan taught school in a remote mountain area to support her
young family, retiring in 1979 to devote her time to working for
he Lord in her community. And her efforts have born fruit in
tremendous growth in the Adventist church in that area.
    She moved to an area where she was the only Adventist. She
began worships in her home. Soon neighbors began to join her for
worship. Within a year more than 100 people were attending the
house church.
    People began asking for Bible studies and baptism. This pre-
sented a problem, for there were no Adventist pastors or elders in
the area. The only pastors authorized to baptize were from the
official Three-Self church. And baptism by one of these pastors
meant joining the Three-Self church.
    After prayerful searching, Wu Lan decided to baptize them
herself. So far Sister Wu has baptized more than 800 people into
the Seventh-day Adventist Church. She has established six churches,
including one with about 500 members in the next province, and
more than 10 house worship groups in the area,
    The church in Sister Wu's area has continued to grow in size
and strength, and now has more than 2,000 members. Four laymen
have been trained and ordained as local elders, and another 12
have trained to become deacons. Thus Sister Wu now has spiritual
leaders to assist her. But so far she has not slowed down in her
work for God.
      "I don't pay any attention to what people say. I only do what
God wants me to do," she said.

   Wu Lan Ying (right) lives
and works in Southeastern
China. Dr. Eugene Hsu is
director of the Eastern Asia
Association, located in Hong
Kong.

    The Church Triumphant




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Isa. 60:1-3; Dan. 12:1-3;
Zech. 2:7-13; Rev. 19:7-9.

   MEMORY TEXT: "Who is she that looketh forth as the morn-
   ing, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army
   with banners?" (Song of Solomon 6:10).

  KEY QUESTION: When and how does the church militant be-
come the church triumphant?

   VICTORY! William A. Ward once said, "God wants us to be
victors, not victims; to grow, not grovel; to soar, not sink; to over-
come, not to be overwhelmed." This sounds much like God's vision
for the church triumphant.
   Knowing that the power of Calvary's love ultimately proves invin-
cible, the church militant boldly, bravely, and humbly exhibits the
righteousness of Christ amid apostasy. Those who receive Christ as
Saviour and Lord not only gain victory over sin but are also knit
together in fellowship with heaven to work for the salvation of others.
When all that God's grace can do for the church and for others has
been accomplished, Christ will return to claim it as His bride. Then,
"the church triumphant will emerge. At that time He will be able to
present 'to himself a glorious church,' the faithful of all ages, the
purchase of His blood, 'not having spot or wrinkle, but holy and
without blemish' (Eph. 5:27)."—Seventh-day Adventists Believe,
p. 141.
   As you study this week's lesson, remember that God wants you to
be a victor and that through the power of His grace you can be just
that!

GUIDED BY GOD (Ps. 32:8; John 16:13).

   A marked feature of the church in the wilderness was God's direct
and visible guidance (Ps. 78:52). He governed their itinerary with a
pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. Thus, their move-
ments were never random or arbitrary. Moreover, wherever the Lord
bade the children of Israel to encamp, He manifested His presence in
the cloud, which hovered over the sanctuary until He planned for them
to move to another place. God's last-day church receives guidance no
less sure.

   List some of God's promises to guide and protect His remnant
church. On what conditions does He fulfill these promises? Ps.
25:9, 10; 32:8; 119:105; John 16:13.


   As the church trusts in God's will and Word, revelations of Christ's
righteousness will illuminate the hearts of the faithful and bless their
endeavors to fulfill the gospel commission.
   "The Word of God illuminates the way so that men may walk
safely in the spiritual darkness of this world. He who has this light to
guide him need not stumble even though his path is beset with evil."
—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 902.
   The church militant triumphs as it follows the Captain of its salva-
tion in His campaign to rescue all who consent to be freed from
Satan's bondage. Members of the church are Christ's support troops in
the final and most intensive phase of His campaign.

   What promise of guidance especially sustains the church in the
last days of its work? Matt. 28:18-20; Heb. 13:5, 6.


   "The work is soon to close. The members of the church militant
who have proved faithful will become the church triumphant. In
reviewing our past history, having traveled over every step of advance
to our present standing, I can say, Praise God! As I see what God has
wrought, I am filled with astonishment and with confidence in Christ
as leader. We have nothing to fear for the future, except as we shall
forget the way the Lord has led us, and his teaching in our past
history."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, Oct. 12, 1905.

     How have you already experienced God's guidance in your
 life? Are you confident that God is guiding His church now and
 that He will continue guiding it in the future? If so, what is the
 basis of your confidence?

                                                                   105
Monday                                             December 23
PURIFIED BY GOD (Rev. 7:13, 14).

   How does God purify His church?

Eph. 5:25-27


Heb. 10:19-23


1 John 1:7


Rev. 7:13, 14

   Washed their robes. "The reason for the purity of the robes is
given. The saints are triumphant, not on their own account, but be-
cause of the victory won by Christ on Calvary. . . . The close connec-
tion between righteousness and victory—both symbolized by white
garments . . . —is demonstrated here. The battle is against sin; right-
eousness is the victory; Christ's righteousness has won the victory;
and upon accepting His righteousness sinners become both righteous
and victorious."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 785.
   The pattern God's people are to follow is the character of Christ.
They rejoice in their adoption as His children, recognizing as they
mature in their fellowship with Jesus how deeply His blood needs to
be applied to their lives. Their appreciation of Christ's atonement is at
the very center of their experience, motivating them to advance with
the assistance of the Holy Spirit from faith to faith, from strength to
strength, from glory to glory. Knowing how desperately they need
purification, the church members thankfully accept His offer.

   "Let the church commence the work of purification before God
by repentance, humiliation, deep heart searching, for we are in the
antitypical day of atonement—solemn hour fraught with eternal re-
sults."—Selected Messages, book 2, p. 378. (See Joel 2:15-23; James
4:4-10.)

  When will the purification process be made complete? Matt.
13:24-30, 36-43.


  Contemplate the end result of God's purification process.
Jer. 50:20.

Tuesday                                           December 24
EMPOWERED BY GOD (Ps. 110:3).

  How does God promise to empower the church so it will tri-
umph? Eph. 3:16-21.


   "The church is God's agency for the proclamation of truth, empow-
ered by Him to do a special work; and if she is loyal to Him, obedient
to all His commandments, there will dwell within her the excellency
of divine grace. If she will be true to her allegiance, if she will honor
the Lord God of Israel, there is no power that can stand against her."—
The Acts of the Apostles, p. 600.

   What spirit or attitude must the church have if it is to be
triumphant? Ps. 110:3; Rev. 12:11, 17.


   God's people will fearlessly press the battle forward. Glorious
rescues from Babylon will be made. The faithfuls' courage and gentle-
ness will give strength to many once-fearful slaves of tradition who
loved the truth but were too timid to take an open, unyielding stand for
Jesus.
   More than one hundred years ago, an earthquake disrupted the
citizens of a small seashore village in Japan. But because the people
were used to them, they quickly resumed their daily lives. On a plain
above the village resided a rice farmer who, after the quake, observed
that the sea looked dark and was moving against the wind. Knowing
what this meant, he longed to warn the people living in the village.
"Bring me a torch! Quickly!" he called to his grandson. The man
rushed with the torch to his rice, harvested and ready for market. As
the dry stalks erupted into a conflagration, the bell from the temple
alerted the villagers to the fire. Up the cliff they scrambled to help
their neighbor.
    "As they reached the plain, the old man shouted back at the top of
his voice, 'Look!' At the edge of the horizon they saw a long, lean,
dim line—a line that thickened as they gazed. That line was the sea,
rising like a high wall and coming more swiftly than a kite flies. . . .
    "On the plain no word was spoken. Then the voice of the old man
was heard, saying gently, 'That is why I set fire to the rice.' He stood
among them almost as poor as the poorest, for his wealth was gone—
but he had saved 400 lives by the sacrifice."—Larson, Illustrations for
 Preaching and Teaching, p. 201; adapted.

    Pray daily that God will empower you to save souls, no mat-
 ter what the cost.

                                                                    107
Wednesday                                          December 25
PRESERVED AND DELIVERED BY GOD (Ps. 91:14-16).

   How do the following promises of protection and deliverance
inspire you? Ps. 27:5, 6; 34:19; 91:1-16.


   These are only a few of God's promises to protect us from the
enemy. These promises are not contradicted by martyrdom, for Satan
and his hosts can go no farther than killing the body. They cannot rob
God's children of their heavenly inheritance (Matt.10:28-33; Heb.
11:32-40).
   In Romans 8:31-39, Paul declares his confidence that nothing can
separate us from God's love unless we allow it. Paul bases his confi-
dence on the fact that when God gave us His Son, He gave us Himself,
thus showing how willing He is to save us. "Surely, then, no matter
what trials may come, we should never doubt that God is ever working
for us and that He will give us all that is necessary for our present and
future good."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 577.

   How will Christ rescue His people in their last hours on this
earth? Dan. 12:1-3; Matt. 24:30, 31; Rev. 19:11-20.


   Ellen White reported the following as it was given to her in vision:
"It was at midnight that God chose to deliver His people. As the
wicked were mocking around them, suddenly the sun appeared, shin-
ing in his strength. . . . The wicked looked upon the scene with
amazement, while the saints beheld with solemn joy the tokens of
their deliverance. . . . Dark, heavy clouds came up and clashed against
each other. But there was one clear place of settled glory, whence
came the voice of God like many waters, shaking the heavens and the
earth. There was a mighty earthquake. The graves were opened, and
those who had died in faith under the third angel's message, keeping
the Sabbath, came forth from their dusty beds, glorified, to hear the
covenant of peace that God was to make with those who had kept His
law. . . .
   "The Israel of God stood with their eyes fixed upward, listening to
the words as they came from the mouth of Jehovah and rolled through
the earth like peals of loudest thunder. It was awfully solemn. At the
end of every sentence the saints shouted, 'Glory! Hallelujah!' Their
countenances were lighted up with the glory of God."—Early Writ-
ings, pp. 285, 286.

  How should God's promises affect the way we view trials and
temptation? How has God already preserved you?

Thursday                                          December 26
GLORIFIED AND TRANSLATED BY GOD (1 Cor. 15:51-58).

  When God comes to deliver the final generation of His faithful
people, what other event also occurs? 1 Thess. 4:15-17; 1 Cor.
15:50-57.


   Ellen White reports these sights and sounds from a vision she
received: "Soon I heard the voice of God, which shook the heavens
and the earth. There was a mighty earthquake. Buildings were shaken
down on every side. I then heard a triumphant shout of victory, loud,
musical, and clear. I looked upon the company, who, a short time
before, were in such distress and bondage. Their captivity was
turned. . . . Their enemies, the heathen around them, fell like dead
men; they could not endure the light that shone upon the delivered,
holy ones. This light and glory remained upon them, until Jesus was
seen in the clouds of heaven, and the faithful, tried company were
changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, from glory to glory.
And the graves were opened, and the saints came forth, clothed with
immortality, crying, 'Victory over death and the grave'; and together
with the living saints they were caught up to meet their Lord in the
air."—Early Writings, pp. 272, 273.

   Why will the joy of the saints be complete as they ascend
heavenward with Christ and His angels? Ps. 126:1-6; 1 Thess.
2:19, 20; 3 John 3, 4.


   The widow's mite, the hungry boy's five loaves and two fish,
Mary's alabaster box—all have encouraged countless numbers of
people to participate in God's service. How these three will rejoice in
heaven when they behold the outcome of their simple, yet meaningful
actions. Likewise, we can only imagine the effect our seemingly
insignificant, daily acts of service will have on others. In heaven we
will meet the people we have fed, sheltered, clothed, nursed, encour-
aged, educated, and prayed for or with. "What rejoicing there will be
as these redeemed ones meet and greet those who have had a burden in
their behalf! And those who have lived, not to please themselves, but
to be a blessing to the unfortunate who have so few blessings—how
their hearts will thrill with satisfaction! They will realize the promise:
`Thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou
shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.' "—Testimonies,
vol. 6, p. 312.

   This is the church triumphant!

                                                                     109
Friday                                            December 27
FURTHER STUDY: Project yourself into the description of the
saints' deliverance portrayed in the chapter "God's People De-
livered," The Great Controversy, pp. 635-652. In your mind, contrast
the destiny of the saved and that of the lost, and resolve anew to
remain unshakably loyal to Christ and His gospel. Or read Revelation
21 and 22, and contemplate the glory of being in the New Jerusalem.
Consider the priorities you might need to reorganize if truly "your
citizenship is in heaven" (Phil. 3:20, NIV).

   "Through them [His people] the Sun of Righteousness will shine
with undimmed luster to the world. Christ has given to His church
ample facilities, that He may receive a large revenue of glory from His
redeemed, purchased possession. He has bestowed upon His people
capabilities and blessings that they may represent His own suffi-
ciency. The church, endowed with the righteousness of Christ, is His
depositary, in which the riches of His mercy, His grace, and His love,
are to appear in full and final display. Christ looks upon His people in
their purity and perfection, as the reward of His humiliation, and the
supplement of His glory."—The Desire of Ages, p. 680.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Carefully review the character description of the 144,000 in
     Revelation 14:1-5. What changes will you have to make in
     order to follow the Lamb wherever He goes?

   2. Discuss the idea of covenanting as a class to pray daily for
      the latter rain. What part will the experience described in
      Revelation 12:11 have in obtaining the latter rain?

   3. After studying this week's lesson, how would you answer
      the Key Question in Sabbath Afternoon's lesson?

SUMMARY: Guided, empowered, and protected by God, the church
will be enveloped with Christ's glory at His second coming. Because
each member will be clothed with Christ's righteousness—the full
manifestation of His indwelling power in every believer's heart—He
will be able to take them to heaven, where there will be no more
sorrow, death, or pain and where God Himself shall wipe away every
tear (Rev. 21:4). "Glory to God in the highest."

Mabel Allissisi
                                   My God Hears!
                                      James Zachary

            She was a Hindu, but she married a Christian. Her family and
                                                                                    I
         Hindu priest told her that her god would punish her if she became
         a Christian. Obediently, she continued to cling to Hinduism.
            Then she became ill with jaundice. Local remedies did not help
         her. One day in desperation her husband, Stephen, told her, "My
         God is the living God. He can heal you. Please pray with me. My
                                                                                    n
         God will hear your prayers." They knelt together and prayed for
         her healing.


                                                                                    i
            The next day Stephen met a woman from a distant village. She
         told him of a Christian teacher who treats jaundice with a medi-
         cine he prepares from a certain plant. When he applies the medi-
         cine, he prays to Jesus, and the sick are cured from their jaundice.
         The couple went to see this Christian teacher and receive treat-
         ments. For ten days Stephen's wife received daily treatments and
         prayed with her husband and the Christian teacher. She was healed.
         She decided to follow her husband in Christianity.
            Her family greeted her decision with anger. "We are Brahmans
         [the highest class of Hindus]. But look at you! You have gotten rid
         of all of your jewelry! You go to a Christian church. You are a
         disgrace to our family. We don't want to see you again without
                                                                                    e
         your jewelry and your kukum [the red dot on the forehead]."
            But Stephen's wife had renounced her Hindu past and had

         a full-time lay preacher. In just four months Stephen and his
