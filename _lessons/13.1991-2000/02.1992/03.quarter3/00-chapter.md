                Introduction to 1 Peter
                 A Living Hope
    First Peter, authored by the apostle Peter, brims with confidence as
to the future of God's people. They are elect according to the fore-
knowledge of God, sanctified by the Spirit (1 Peter 1:2), and destined
for an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance (1 Peter 1:4). Though
subject to abuse and persecution, God's people will be kept by faith
in His power. They will be presented in the last days as "exhibit A"
for the world and the rest of the universe to see—a living demonstra-
tion of what the grace of God can do for fallen beings (1 Peter 1:4, 5).
    All this is possible because of the resurrection of Jesus (1 Peter 1:3).
Peter, who had lost his courage and hope through the arrest, trial, and
death of Jesus, came to see nothing but glory and victory for those
who remain true and obedient to God. He "hath begotten us again
unto a lively [living] hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
dead" (1 Peter 1:3).
    Christians, who were already suffering trials at the hands of a hos-
tile civil government, would soon undergo severe persecution. The
Lord's prediction as to the manner of Peter's death was soon to be
fulfilled; the faithful apostle was to be a martyr. (See The Acts of the
Apostles, p. 538.)
    Peter's exuberance over the future of God's people was not a fan-
tasy. Although he and his fellow believers were to suffer, they had a
living hope that elevated them above the fury and hatred of this
world. Their hope was centered in their risen Lord, who promised a
future for His people so exciting that none would want to miss it. This
hope and excitement shines forth from the pages of Peter's First
Epistle.
    Although 1 Peter was written for people in every age, it has special
significance for God's church at the end of time. (See The Acts of the
 Apostles, p. 518.) When God's people experience a renewed manifes-
 tation of Satan's wrath, Peter's Epistle will inspire confidence, faith,
and courage in many hearts.

    Peter: First Among Equals




READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matthew 16:13-20; Acts 1:15-
22; Mark 14:66-72; John 21:15-19; Acts 9:32-43.
    MEMORY TEXT: "But Peter and John answered and said unto
    them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto
    you more than unto God, judge ye" (Acts 4:19).

   KEY THOUGHT. Lovingly Jesus worked with Peter as He
works with us, encouraging what was good and valuable, soften-
ing what was harsh, and purging what was offensive.
   PETER WAS GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE. After the resur-
rection of Jesus, Peter was called before the Sanhedrin, the govern-
ing body of his people. Possibly some of the elders remembered
his shameful denial of friendship with Jesus. On trial for preaching
Jesus and the power of His resurrection (Acts 4:1-22), Peter was
threatened with imprisonment and death. What followed was to-
tally unexpected. Peter, the coward, had become the powerful de-
fender of his Lord. Peter made good his second chance.
   Filled with the Holy Spirit, Peter credited Jesus with the healing
of the disabled man at the Beautiful Gate of the temple (Acts 3:1-
10). He informed the council that God had contradicted their ver-
dict in regard to Jesus. They had judged Him a blasphemer worthy
of death; God had exonerated His Son, raising Him to life.
   Who was this man—this Peter—who wrote the letter we will
study this quarter? By understanding Peter, we can better under-
stand his message—and better understand ourselves.

SPOKESMAN FOR THE APOSTLES (Matt. 16:13-20).
   Apostolic lists. The New Testament gives four lists containing
the names of the apostles (Matt. 10:1-4; Mark 3:13-19; Luke 6:12-16;
Acts 1:13). Matthew is the only writer who uses the word first in
connection with Peter. However, in each of the lists, Peter's name
appears first. This would indicate that Peter was respected and rec-
ognized as the most prominent of the apostles, even though his
authority was no greater than that of his peers.
  Upon whom did Jesus build the Christian church? What
authority did Jesus give to all the apostles? Matt. 16:13-20 (com-
pare 18:18).

   On the basis of Matthew 16:13-20, some would have us believe
Peter's authority exceeded that of his fellow apostles. This is not
so. The keys given to Peter are the words of Jesus that will open
the kingdom to those who accept them. (See Luke 11:52; compare
The Desire of Ages, p. 413.) The rock upon which the Christian
church was built is Jesus. (See Eph. 2:20; compare The Desire of
Ages, p. 414.) Because of his nature, Peter became the leader of his
peers, but he possessed no greater authority. "Christ is the founda-
tion rock—the Gibraltar—upon which his church was at that mo-
ment being built and which is still in the process . . . of being built
to this day."—Randolph 0. Yeager, The Renaissance New Testament
(Kentucky: Renaissance Press, 1977), vol. 2, p. 544.
   Consider other occasions when Peter was spokesman for the
disciples. Matt. 17:1-5; 19:27-30; Luke 8:45; 12:41; John 6:67-69.

   "What is in it for us?" The Greek text of Matthew 19:27 pre-
sents Peter's question in an interesting way: "In view of what You
have just said, What is in it for us?" In Phillips' translation Peter
asks, "What will that be worth to us?" To ask such a frank ques-
tion was characteristic of Peter. His naturally outgoing personality
made him a frequent spokesman for the disciples.
  Do you have questions that you would not dare ask Jesus
publicly? When you have asked Him privately, what interesting
answers have you received?



                                                                      7

LEADER OF APOSTLES (Acts 1:15-22).
   By nature Peter was a man of action and enthusiasm. These char-
acteristics evidently earned him an early leadership role among his
fellow apostles, despite his human weaknesses.
   What type of leadership role did Peter assume in the Garden
of Gethsemane? John 18:10.

    Although Peter took the initiative to fight in defense of his
Master, his efforts were counteracted by Jesus Himself. When the
disciples saw Jesus meekly submit to the arresting party, they
could not understand His action. If they were not permitted to
save Jesus from this hostile mob, they could at least save
themselves. Again Peter acted as leader: "In their indignation and
fear, Peter proposed that they save themselves. Following this sug-
gestion, 'they all forsook him, and fled.' "—The Desire of Ages, p.
697.
   Leader in the early church. After the ascension of Jesus, Peter
assumed a leadership role in the infant church. This is recorded in
the early chapters of Acts.
    Be prepared to discuss Peter's role in the events described:

    Acts 1:15-26. The replacement of Judas.

    Acts 2:1-47. The Pentecost sermon.

    Acts 3:1-10. The healing of the disabled man.

  Acts 3:12-26. The speech to the crowd on behalf of John and
himself.

    Acts 4:1-22. Peter's defense at his trial.

    Acts 5:17-42. His defense at a second trial.
   Wearing Peter's sandals. Try to put yourself in Peter's sandals.
After denying his Lord three times during Jesus' trial, he was the
first apostle to whom Jesus revealed Himself after His resurrec-
tion. If you were Peter, what would have been the topic of con-
versation between yourself and your resurrected Lord?

PETER'S DENIAL
        DENIAL (Mark 14:66-72).
   When Jesus warned Peter of the rapidly approaching trial of
his faith, what was Peter's response? Luke 22:33.

   Offended by Jesus' words, the self-confident Peter pressed his
resolve to stand by his Lord.
   "When Peter said he would follow his Lord to prison and to
death, he meant it, every word of it; but he did not know himself.
Hidden in his heart were elements of evil that circumstances
would fan into life. Unless he was made conscious of his danger,
these would prove his eternal ruin. The Saviour saw in him a self-
love and assurance that would overbear even his love for
Christ."—The Desire of Ages, p. 673.
   The self-sufficient Christian is an easy prey for Satan because he
does not have a correct knowledge of himself. But here is a prom-
ise for all who are willing to set self aside and trust in God: "There
is no power in the whole satanic force that can disable the soul
that trusts, in simple confidence, in the wisdom that comes from
God."—Sons and Daughters of God, p. 91.
   How did Peter act during Jesus' trial? Luke 22:54, 55.

   As John entered the judgment hall, he made no attempt to con-
ceal his relationship with Jesus. Because he did not mingle with
those who were reviling Jesus, he was not questioned. Because he
did not assume a false character, he did not make himself liable to
suspicion. Seeking a retired corner away from the mob, but as near
as possible to Jesus, he watched and heard all that took place at
the trial of his Lord. (See The Desire of Ages, pp. 711, 712.)
   By contrast, Peter tried to lose himself in the crowd. Assuming
an air of indifference so his true identity might not be known, he
joined in the jests being hurled at Jesus. But it all appeared so un-
natural; he was acting a lie. He was setting himself up to be cut
down by Satan.
   By acting a lie, Peter had put himself in an unenviable posi-
tion. How did Satan take advantage of the situation? Mark 14:66-
71. How did Jesus' reaction affect Peter? Luke 22:61, 62.

  How have you felt when by word or action you have denied
your Lord?
                                                                     9

PETER'S RESTORATION (John 21:15-19).
   Because Peter's repentance was genuine, a dramatic change took
place.
   What evidence exists that the other apostles accepted Peter
back into their group even before they saw the resurrected Lord?
John 20:1-10. At what point was Peter given the assurance that
Jesus had forgiven him? Luke 24:34.

   The restoration. Peter had publicly disqualified himself to be an
apostle. Now he was to be restored to that select group by a public
confession. Three times Jesus asked Peter whether he loved Him
(John 21:15-19), and three times Peter assured Jesus that he did. With
each response Jesus gave Peter a commission to care for His sheep.
  What was the relationship between Jesus, the Master, and the
apostles? John 15:14, 15.

   It was from this special relationship with Jesus that Peter had
disqualified himself. When Jesus asked Peter whether he loved
Him (agapao), Peter replied with the verb (phileo), which forms the
base for the word friend (philos). Thus Peter not only assured Jesus
he loved Him but communicated that he loved Him as a true
"friend"—as one who would be obediently loyal (John 15:14).
   The third time Jesus asked the question, He changed the verb,
"Simon, son of John, do you love [phileo] me?" (John 21:17, RSV).
Although Peter was concerned that Jesus asked this question
again, this time he had the assurance that he was accepted back
into the society of Jesus' "friends."
  To what extent will those who love Jesus follow His wishes?
John 14:15; 1 John 5:3.

    Peter committed himself to total loyalty to Christ—to all His
leading and commands. Only the born-again Christian has the
power to live in such complete unity with his Lord. (See 1 John 5:4,
5.)
   How does your born-again relationship with Christ keep you
from repeating Peter's failure?

FAITHFUL UNDERSHEPHERD (Acts 9:32-43).
  With the exception of one recorded relapse (Gal. 2:11-14), Peter
proved himself a loyal friend of Jesus.
  In addition to his powerful sermons in Acts 2-5, how else did
Peter prove to be a faithful undershepherd?
  Acts 5:1-16

  Acts 9:32-43

  Acts 10:1-48

  Acts 15:6-11
   "There had been a time in Peter's experience when he was
unwilling to see the cross in the work of Christ. When the Sav-
iour made known to the disciples His impending sufferings and
death, Peter exclaimed, 'Be it far from thee, Lord: this shall not
be unto thee.' Matthew 16:22. Self-pity, which shrank from fel-
lowship with Christ in suffering, prompted Peter's remonstrance.
It was to the disciple a bitter lesson, and one which he learned
but slowly, that the path of Christ on earth lay through agony
and humiliation. But in the heat of the furnace fire he was to
learn its lesson."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 525.
   How did Peter's life end? "In the providence of God, Peter was
permitted to close his ministry in Rome, where his imprisonment
was ordered by the emperor Nero about the time of Paul's final
arrest. Thus the two veteran apostles, who for many years had
been widely separated in their labors, were to bear their last wit-
ness for Christ in the world's metropolis, and upon its soil to shed
their blood as the seed of a vast harvest of saints and martyrs. . . .
   "Once so unready to acknowledge the cross, he now counted
it a joy to yield up his life for the gospel. . . . As a last favor he
entreated his executioners that he might be nailed to the cross
with his head downward. The request was granted, and in this
manner died the great apostle Peter."—The Acts of the Apostles,
pp. 537, 538.
  Draw up a list of Peter's characteristics before and after his
conversion. What are the differences? Has your appreciation of
Peter changed as a result of your study?
                                                                   11

FOR FURTHER STUDY: Consider Peter's role in the events de-
scribed in Acts 4:32-5:42. Read the following from The Acts of the
Apostles, "A Warning Against Hypocrisy," pp. 70-76; "Before the
Sanhedrin," pp. 77-86.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Since we live in a world that is hostile toward God, is it ever
     wise to hide your church affiliation?
      2. Why do you think the Lord chose Peter to preach the great
         sermon on the Day of Pentecost recorded in Acts 2? Why did
         He not choose one of the other apostles, who had not pub-
         licly denied Him? On what basis does the Lord choose
         leaders—personality? ability? character?
SUMMARY: There is much that we can learn from Peter's life—
the dangers of self-sufficiency, loyalty in the face of opposition,
courage in the face of danger, and reliance upon the strength of
Christ. But perhaps the one thing we learn above all else is the
love, patience, and tender pity that Jesus has for His erring chil-
dren.

          Elect Strangers and
                Pilgrims



Sabha&Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Peter 1:1, 2; 4:3, 4; 5:12-14.
  MEMORY TEXT: "Elect according to the foreknowledge of
  God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obe-
  dience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto
  you, and peace, be multiplied" (1 Peter 1:2).
   KEY THOUGHT. Peter addresses his letter to those who have
heard or read the gospel invitation and have responded—the elect
in Asia Minor and those from all places and periods throughout
the Christian era.
   THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER WAS COMMISSIONED
BY JESUS. When He told Peter that Satan desired to sift him as
wheat, Jesus added the commission, "When thou art converted,
strengthen thy brethren" (Luke 22:32). When Peter was restored to
the society of Jesus' friends, he was instructed to tend to the lambs
and sheep (John 21:15-17). The first letter of Peter is a fulfillment,
in part, of the Lord's commission. It is a pastoral letter that encour-
ages and exhorts the weary pilgrim to faithfulness and steadfast
endurance, while it addresses the destiny of God's people with
confidence. Its words and phrases reflect the experience of the au-
thor, bearing "the impress of having been written by one in whom
the sufferings of Christ and also His consolation had been made to

and whose hope of eternal life was sure and steadfast."—The Acts
of the Apostles, p. 517.

A LETTER FROM BABYLON (1 Peter 1:1; 5:13).
   To what position of responsibility had Peter been called?
1 Peter 1:1.

   An apostle is "a delegate, messenger, one sent forth with or-
ders."—Joseph Henry Thayer, Thayer's Greek-English Lexicon of the
New Testament (Grand Rapids: Associated Publishers and Authors,
Inc., n.d.), p. 68. The apostle Paul defended his apostleship by re-
minding his readers that he had received direct revelations from
God. (See 2 Cor. 12:1-12.) He spoke of "the signs of an apostle . . .
wonders, and mighty deeds" (verse 12). In his direct association
with Jesus, Peter had received direct revelations from God, and the
book of Acts records the miracles and mighty deeds the Holy
Spirit performed through him after Jesus' ascension.
   Peter identified himself as an apostle because: (1) he had associ-
ated directly with Jesus for the period of His ministry, (2) he was
selected by Jesus from among a multitude of disciples to be one of
His closest followers—followers whom Jesus called apostles (Luke
6:12-16), and (3) he had been commissioned by Jesus to do a spe-
cial work of shepherding (Luke 22:32; John 21:15-17).
   There is no record of Peter's apostleship's being challenged as
there is of Paul's. On several occasions Paul began his Epistles with a
defense of his calling. (See Gal. 1:1, 11, 12.) Peter offers no such de-
fense. He simply identifies himself as one who had been chosen by
Jesus to carry out special orders that had been given to him.

     From what city did Peter write his letter? 1 Peter 5:13.

   The actual city of Babylon or the region in which this proud
capital of the Chaldean empire once stood is not to be understood
as the site from which Peter wrote his letter. The name "Babylon"
was used as a safeguard and an allegory to identify the city of
Rome, because it was "becoming the oppressor of the new . . .
Israel."—J. H. A. Hart, "The First Epistle General of Peter," The
Expositor's Greek Testament, W. Robertson Nicoll, ed. (Grand Rap-
ids, Mich.: Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1970), vol. 5, p. 80.

  What authority should apostolic writings have for Christian
believers? (See Eph. 2:20; 3:5.) What relationship do you see be-
tween these writings and inspired writings not included in the
Bible? (See Joel 2:28, 29.)

PETER IN ROME (1 Peter 5:12).
   What attitude toward Christians by non-Christians is implied
in Peter's First Epistle? 1 Peter 2:12; 4:12-16.

   What was Peter doing in Rome? The indications are that Peter
wrote this Epistle toward the end of his life. Possibly he was writ-
ing at the time of Nero's persecution. We have been told: (1) Peter
was arrested at about the time of Paul's second arrest (A.D. 66); (2)
Peter was in Rome when arrested; (3) he had been exposing the
deceptions and defeating the plots of Simon Magus, the sorcerer;
and (4) Nero, a believer in magic and a patron of Simon, ordered
Peter's arrest. (See The Story of Redemption, p. 315.)
   What experience had Peter previously had with Simon the sor-
cerer? Acts 8:4-24.

  Simon Magus, the sorcerer, had previously passed himself off as
the great power of God (Acts 8:9, 10). When confronted by the
preaching of Philip, apparently the power of Satan in Simon's life
was temporarily broken. Later the evil one resumed control.
   In Rome the two men, representing two conflicting supernatural
powers, met again. Peter demonstrated that Simon did not repre-
sent the power of God, but was a fraud. However, another repre-
sentative of Satan came to Simon's aid. After his arrest by Nero,
Peter laid down his life as a martyr for the gospel.
   One argument used by those who deny that Peter wrote this
Epistle is the good quality of Greek in which this Epistle is writ-
ten. How can this be explained? 1 Peter 5:12.

   The word by can mean that Silvanus was the secretary who took
Peter's dictation and put Peter's words on paper (parchment),
using his own skill with the Greek language. However, note the
change wrought by the gift of tongues on the Day of Pentecost:
"From this time forth the language of the disciples was pure, sim-
ple, and accurate, whether they spoke in their native tongue or in a
foreign language."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 40.
   Who was the well-known Bible writer who attended Peter
when he was writing his Epistle? 1 Peter 5:13 (compare Acts
12:12, 13, 25; 13:13; 15:37-40; 2 Tim. 4:11).

                                                                   15

THE ELECT PILGRIMS (1 Peter 1:1).
     Who were the recipients of Peter's letter? 1 Peter 1:1.

   The Greek text says: "To the elect pilgrims (sojourners) of the
dispersion." There are three important ideas embedded in this
phrase—elect, pilgrims, dispersion.
   Elect. Two very common ideas attached to the word elect are
predestination based on arbitrary divine decrees and triumphalism
(undue confidence in one's beliefs). In harmony with the rest of the
New Testament, Peter's Epistle does not reflect either of these erro-
neous ideas. Peter had learned by his bitter experience in
Caiaphas's courtyard that there is no place for triumphalism or
boasting in the Christian's experience. The apostle Paul speaks of
predestination based on God's foreknowledge of individual re-
sponse to His grace.
  From the following verses, identify the elect whom God has
predestined. Rom. 8:29; Eph. 1:5, 11, 12.

   Notice that God's predestination is based on His foreknowledge
of human choice (Rom. 8:29).
   Ellen White defines the word elect: "Every soul is elected who will
work out his own salvation with fear and trembling. He is elected
who will put on the armor and fight the good fight of faith. He is
elected who will watch unto prayer, who will search the Scriptures,
and flee from temptation. He is elected who will have faith continu-
ally, and who will be obedient to every word that proceedeth out of
the mouth of God. The provisions of redemption are free to all; the
results of redemption will be enjoyed by those who have complied
with the conditions."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 208.
   Elect pilgrims. Peter is writing to a special group of pilgrims—
an elect group of pilgrims. Heaven is their true home.
   Elect pilgrims of the dispersion. The "exiles of the dispersion"
(1 Peter 1:1, RSV) were the Jews who had been scattered all over
the Roman world and beyond. But Peter is using this well-known
phrase in a new way to address a new Israel who are strangers
and pilgrims in the alien environment of sin. That Peter has his
fellow Christians (Gentiles) in mind is made clear in verses 3
and 4.
     Do you regard yourself as one of God's elect? Why?

A MESSAGE FOR GENTILES (1 Peter 4:3, 4).
    What would indicate that these "elect pilgrims of the
dispersion" are not Jewish converts to Christianity, but are Gen-
tile converts? 1 Peter 1:14; 2:10; 4:3, 4.

   Examine the map below, and locate the following:
  1.The churches founded by Paul in the province of Galatia dur-
ing his first missionary tour.
   2. The areas to which Peter wrote (1 Peter 1:1).

   Although we do not have direct evidence that Peter worked in
this area of the Roman Empire, we are told that he did bear his
testimony in many lands. (See The Acts of the Apostles, p. 517.) In
examining the map, it becomes clear that Peter's Epistle is a circu-
lar letter addressed to the leading Christian churches in Asia
Minor. The churches of Galatia raised up by Paul and the seven
churches of Revelation were included by Peter as being among the
elect pilgrims of the dispersion.
  Why should Gentile converts to Christianity be especially
grateful to Jews? What special blessings have Jews passed on to
Gentiles?

                                                                 17

QUALIFIED BY THE TRINITY (1 Peter 1:2).
   As you read verse 2, look for the three phrases that explain
election. Write down each phrase and the member of the Trinity
involved in the experience described by Peter.
        Phrase                        Member of Trinity




   Elect according to the foreknowledge of God. Although God is
all-knowing, and the future is open to Him as if it were the present
and the past, His foreknowledge does not determine a person's
destiny; it does not short-circuit the freedom of choice He has
given to His earthly children. "There is no such thing in the Word
of God as unconditional election."—Ellen G. White Comments,
Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1114.
   "Everyone who will humble himself as a little child, who will
receive and obey the Word of God with a child's simplicity, will be
among the elect of God."—Ellen G. White Comments, Seventh-day
Adventist Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1114.
   Elect by means of sanctification through the power of the
Spirit. In the phrase "by the sanctification of the Spirit," the Spirit
is the One who acts, and sanctification is the action that is per-
formed. Sanctification (holiness) is a gift of the Holy Spirit, not a
characteristic earned by mere human effort. (See 1 Cor. 6:11;
2 Thess. 2:13.) By permitting this work of the Spirit in one's life, a
person is qualified to be among the elect.
   Elect for the purpose of obedience and cleansing by the blood of
Jesus. The existence of the elect denies Satan's charges against God.
   1. Their lives are committed to doing God's will, and they are
empowered by the Spirit to fulfill God's purpose—obedience to
Him. (See John 14:15; 1 John 5:2-5.)
   2. Cleansing believers by the blood of Jesus and justifying them
because of His death, God has shown His love for mankind. He is
preparing a people to be taken into His everlasting kingdom.
  As one of God's elect, in what ways do you think God wants
you to cooperate with His endeavors to prepare you and others to
spend eternity with Him?

FURTHER STUDY: On the experience of holiness, see: 1 Cor. 1:2;
6:11; Col. 2:10. On the experience of growth in holiness, see:
1 Thess. 3:11-4:3; 2 Cor. 3:18. Read "The Call by the Sea," The De-
sire of Ages, pp. 244-251; and "God's Purpose for His Church," The
Acts of the Apostles, pp. 9-16.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Ancient letter writers sometimes gave the ideas to a secretary
     (amanuensis), who expressed the writer's thought in his own
     words. If this is the manner in which some New Testament
     books were written, how would this fact affect your concept
     of inspiration? (Compare 1 Peter 5:12.)
  2. How does the gift of the freedom of choice relate to God's
     predestination?
  3. How do the three prepositional phrases of 1 Peter 1:2 convey
     the optimism and positive outlook that Peter has regarding
     the present condition and the future of God's people?
   4. Holiness, a qualification for heaven (Heb. 12:14), is a gift of
      the Holy Spirit (1 Peter 1:2). But we are judged by our works
      (Rev. 22:12; 20:12; 1 Peter 1:17; 2 Cor. 5:10). Why? What part
      do works play in salvation?
   5. A friend of yours thinks there is no hope for him. Because of
      his many failures, he believes that he was born to be lost.
      How would you share with him the great truth that God
      wants him to be saved?
SUMMARY: The three members of the Godhead are directly in-
volved in the redemption of the elect. In consultation with the
Spirit and the Son, the all-knowing Father has devised a plan to
redeem the human family. Based on the death of the Son, the Holy
Spirit bestows Himself upon those who believe. Thus He gives
them holiness (1 Peter 1:2). By shedding His blood, the Son has
made it possible for every person to stand justified before God.
This whole divine plan prepares God's elect for eternal fellowship
with Him because they have received His power for obedience to
His law.

              Our Living Hope




Sailittiltterttoott
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Peter 1:3-5.
     MEMORY TEXT: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord
     Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath be-
     gotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus
     Christ from the dead" (1 Peter 1:3).
   KEY THOUGHT. Acceptance of Jesus brings a hope that touches
every moment and every aspect of life—the family, the job, personal
relationships, recreation, as well as the personal, quiet moments
when we are alone with our thoughts. Christians see the future as
full of promise; they expect the dawn of a glorious morning.
   ONE OF ELLEN WHITE'S FAVORITE PASSAGES. 1 Peter
1:3-9 is among several passages of Scripture favored by Ellen
White, probably because God had shown her the preciousness of
the promises these verses contain. On several occasions she quoted
these verses, or portions of them, to people who were discouraged
and beginning to falter in their Christian experience. Often she
would let Peter's words stand without comment, giving the reader
time to sample the apostle's faith and confidence in Jesus.
   In these verses, a portion of which we will study this week, can
be found "most precious promises, the foundation for large expec-
tations, if we will act upon the instruction given."—Manuscript 81,
1908. As you study this week's lesson, savor each word written by
Peter, weigh each promise, catch his excitement about the future,
and rejoice in our living hope.

OUR LIVING HOPE (1 Peter 1:3).
   Blessed be God. Peter's heart was now full of praise.
   "When Christ was crucified, they did not believe that He would
rise. He had stated plainly that He was to rise on the third day, but
they were perplexed to know what He meant. This lack of compre-
hension left them at the time of His death in utter hopelessness."—
The Acts of the Apostles, p. 26.
   What event changed the outlook of Jesus' followers? 1 Peter
1:3.

   "This God is not only the Father of our Lord, but also the One
who gave us the new birth (John 3:3, 7). For what purpose? . The
result, since God's purposes are always identical with His results,
is (a) that, having been born from above, by the miracle of spiritual
regeneration, we now have a hope that is perennially alive. . . . All
that God does for us is by means of, and therefore contingent
upon, the physical resurrection of Jesus Christ in the same body in
which He suffered at Calvary. There is no 'living hope' if Jesus is
dead (1 Cor. 15:12-19)."—Randolph 0. Yeager, The Renaissance New
Testament (Gretna, Louisiana: Pelican, 1985), vol. 17, p. 57.
  Hope of future immortality. The gift of the new-birth experi-
ence involves the bestowal of eternal life upon the believing, re-
pentant sinner. (See John 3:36; 1 John 5:11-14.) Fellowship with
Christ finally culminates in the thrilling transformation to im-
mortality at the second advent of Jesus. (See 1 Cor. 15:51-54.)
   What were the personal feelings of the apostles before and
after the resurrection of Jesus?
   Before: Luke 24:1-11
   After: Luke 24:52, 53
   "Their enemies expected to see upon their faces an expression of
sorrow and defeat. Instead of this there was only gladness and tri-
umph. Their faces were aglow with a happiness not born of
earth."—The Desire of Ages, p. 832.
  How would you describe the practical effect on your life of
the hope resulting from the resurrection of Christ?

                                                                   21

A NEW UNDERSTANDING OF MISSION
  What changes did the resurrection bring to the apostles'
understanding of Jesus' mission on earth?
     Before: Luke 18:31-34; 24:21
     After: Luke 24:27, 32, 45
   The disciples thought the Messiah would establish an earthly
kingdom and exalt Israel to international predominance. After the
resurrection, they caught a vision of the suffering Saviour, bearing
the sins of the world.
   What change took place in the disciples' understanding of
their own role in Jesus' kingdom?
     Before: Matt. 18:1-4; Mark 9:33-37
  Personal ambition works havoc with spiritual commitment and
dedication to unselfish service.
     After: Acts 1:3-14
   Petty political parochialism gave way to the vision of world
evangelism. They went to their knees with the earnest plea that
their living Lord would pour out upon them the empowering Holy
Spirit. Differences were put away; brother was bound in fellowship
with brother. Jesus' will became the paramount concern. (See The
Acts of the Apostles, p. 37.)
   What change took place in the apostles' attitude toward Gen-
tiles, and how would this change affect their mission?
     Before: Matt. 15:21-28
   Nothing more effectively cripples the capacity to serve God and
humanity than prejudice and bigotry. It is impossible to relieve
aching hearts and distracted minds while viewing their owners as
inferior, second-class citizens. (See The Desire of Ages, p. 402.)
     After: Acts 10:44-48
   Peter reminded his fellow Jews that as God fulfilled His cov-
enant with Abraham, the blessings of salvation would extend to all
the families of earth.

OUR INHERITANCE (1 Peter 1:4).
   Peter was a child of Abraham, a son of the covenant, an heir of the
promises. The confidence of Peter's generation that the inheritance of
the promises contained in the Abrahamic covenant was a sure thing
is reflected by two contemporaries—Paul and Nicodemus.
    Paul wrote, "If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he
might trust in the flesh, I more: circumcised the eighth day, of the
stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the
Hebrews" (Phil. 3:4, 5).
    Nicodemus "was startled at the thought of a kingdom too pure for
him to see in his present state. . . . But by virtue of his birth as an
Israelite he regarded himself as sure of a place in the kingdom of
God. He felt that he needed no change."—The Desire of Ages, p. 171.
   What kind of inheritance is the prospect of every born-again
believer in Christ? 1 Peter 1:4.

   The earthly aspirations of Jesus' disciples gave way to an inde-
scribable longing for the "better land." Notice the three character-
istics of the heavenly inheritance that Peter envisions:
"imperishable, undefiled, and unfading" (RSV). There will be no
death there, no perishable forms of life. There will be no sin there;
defilement is destroyed when Jesus appears. There will be no ugli-
ness there; beauty will not fade. Eternal youth will replace the rav-
ages of old age; eternal spring will replace the fading beauty of fall
and the stark austerity of winter.
   In what sense are we joint heirs with Christ? Rom. 8:17.

   An incomprehensible mystery. As the promised Seed of Abra-
ham, Jesus realized the fulfillment of the promises contained in the
covenant God made with Abraham. (See Gen. 15:1-6; 17:1-8.) He
now shares them with us. When we accept Jesus as our Saviour,
we are adopted by God (Rom. 8:15). As His adopted children we
become heirs (Rom. 8:17). We share with Jesus the riches and joys
that He possesses, because we are now joint heirs with Him.
  The fulfillment of our mission must precede the reception of
our heavenly inheritance. Are there earthly considerations that
are hindering our involvement in mission? What suggestions do
you have? How can these hindrances be removed?

                                                                     23

OUR SECURITY (1 Peter 1:5, first part).
   How does God show His love for His earthly children? 1 Peter
1:5, first part; Ps. 34:7.

   The Greek word translated "kept" in the KJV is more accu-
rately rendered "guarded" by the RSV and "shielded" by the
NIV. It is a military term that means to protect or to guard with
the use of troops.
   "Every redeemed one will understand the ministry of angels in
his own life. The angel who was his guardian from his earliest
moment; the angel who watched his steps, and covered his head in
the day of peril; the angel who was with him in the valley of the
shadow of death, who marked his resting place, who was the first
to greet him in the resurrection morning—what will it be to hold
converse with him, and to learn the history of divine interposition
in the individual life, of heavenly co-operation in every work for
humanity!"—Education, p. 305.
   Besides our guardian angel, through what other means does
the power of God protect us? Ps. 119:11.

  There is life-giving power and protecting capability in God's
Word. The Holy Spirit uses the Word to deliver us from evil. Faced
by the tempter, Jesus appealed to the Word (Matt. 4:4, 7, 10). The
devil cannot invade the mind of the individual who daily com-
munes with Jesus through the Word.
  What assurances are we given that evil will not overcome us?
Matt. 16:18 (compare Isa. 26:20, 21).

   "The Lord's faithful servants will receive the bitterest persecu-
tion from false teachers, who will not hear the Word of God, and
who prepare stumbling blocks to put in the way of those who
would hear. But God's people are not to fear. Satan cannot go be-
yond his limit. The Lord will be the defense of His people. He
regards the injury done to His servants for the truth's sake as done
to Himself."—Maranatha, p. 191.
     What testimony can you give of the Lord's care for you?

OUR PART (1 Peter 1:5, second part)
  Although God protects and shields His people, what is re-
quired on our part? 1 Peter 1:5, second part.

   "This powerful shield is ours if we live by faith in the living
Christ. Faith is absolutely essential for Christian discipleship. It is
by faith that we come to Christ, and it is by faith that we live for
Him day by day (Gal. 3:11). Paul instructs us to use the shield of
faith to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one (Eph. 6:16).
   "The key to using this shield is to do so in God's power . . . and
not our own. The promise of Jesus to us is that when we receive
the Holy Spirit, we also receive the power of God (Acts 1:8). The
Acts of the Apostles is a wonderful commentary of those brothers
and sisters in the early church who lived by the power of God."—
Paul A. Cedar, The Communicator's Commentary: James, 1, 2 Peter,
Jude (Waco, Texas: Word Books, 1984), p. 116.
   What has God already prepared that He is waiting to reveal "in
the last time"? 1 Peter 1:5 (compare Matt. 24:30, 31; 2 Thess. 1:7).

   Peter is speaking about the second coming of Christ. The en-
emies of God and of His people will be destroyed (Rev. 6:14-16).
The living saints who have been sealed prior to the close of proba-
tion will be translated with the righteous dead who have been
raised. (See Rev. 7:1-3, 15-17; 14:1-5; 1 Thess. 4:16-18.)
   Earth's final scene. "It is at midnight that God manifests His
power for the deliverance of His people. The sun appears, shining
in its strength. Signs and wonders follow in quick succession. The
wicked look with terror and amazement upon the scene, while the
righteous behold with solemn joy the tokens of their deliverance.
Everything in nature seems turned out of its course. The streams
cease to flow. Dark heavy clouds come up and clash against each
other. In the midst of the angry heavens is one clear space of inde-
scribable glory, whence comes the voice of God like the sound of
many waters, saying: 'It is done.' Revelation 16:17."—The Great
Controversy, p. 636.
   What experiences have you had that illustrate the power of
faith? For example, how has faith in Christ enabled you to over-
come habits that used to control you? What does faith in Christ's
coming do for you?

                                                                     25

FURTHER STUDY: As you consider the final deliverance of God's
people, study the following passages: Matt. 24:30, 31; 2 Tim. 4:6-8,
18; Rev. 7:9-17. Read "God's People Delivered," The Great Contro-
versy, pp. 635-652.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What means would you use to convince a skeptic that faith in
     Christ results in great power in the life?
     2. How would you explain to a professing Christian who be-
        lieves in the New Age philosophy that Christ is the only
        means of salvation and the Bible the ultimate authoritative
        source?
     3. What evidence can you give from Scripture that Christ's com-
        ing will be seen by all, not only by those living in a particular
        geographical area?
     4. What steps do you plan to take to ensure that, in these final
        days of earth's history, you will be "kept by the power of
        God"?
SUMMARY: The verses that we have studied this week from
1 Peter are filled with encouragement and assurance. How bright
and happy our lives would be if we would accept by faith the
message of these verses! The resurrection of Jesus has given us a
new and living hope. We have an eternal inheritance that is being
kept in trust for us. God loves us and shields us from the one who
would destroy us. Although problems come into our lives, God
keeps us from being overwhelmed and swept away. "Blessed be
the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ!"

      The Triumph of Faith




SakhatIAfterfioon-
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Peter 1:6-12.
  MEMORY TEXT: "That the trial of your faith, being much
  more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried
  with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at
  the appearing of Jesus Christ" (1 Peter 1:7).
  KEY THOUGHT. The faith of God's people, purified by trial,
culminates in their salvation. Prophets and angels have sought ear-
nestly for an understanding of God's plan of salvation.

   FAITH TESTED. When David, in the name of the God of Israel,
accepted the challenge to fight Goliath, he proposed to fight with a
staff and a sling. Despite King Saul's concern, David had faith that
God could use his sling. He had defended his father's flocks from all
predators. Previous encounters with danger and death had proved
to him the genuineness of God's protecting love and the effectiveness
of his sling. David's faith was the product of test and trial.
   Last week we saw how God the Father had begotten the apos-
tles again to a living hope and how He guards His earthly chil-
dren (1 Peter 1:3-5). This week we will see that the trial of our
faith will work to Jesus' glory and the salvation of our souls
(1 Peter 1:6-9). In addition, we will see that, when the Holy Spirit
inspired the prophets to write about the future fulfillment of
God's plan to redeem men from sin, they did not completely
understand all the implications of their statements (1 Peter 1:10-
12).
                                                                  27

 Widr
GENUINE FAITH (1 Peter 1:6, 7).
   Peter knew that the road the Christian must walk is strewn with
hazards and difficulties. A famous preacher once said, "If you seek
first the Kingdom of God, you will have trouble; but if you seek
something else first, you will have nothing but trouble."—Charles
S. Ball, "I & II Peter," The Wesleyan Bible Commentary, vol. 6 (Grand
Rapids: William B. Eerdman's, 1972), p. 252.
     In what do Peter's readers rejoice? 1 Peter 1:6.

   "Wherein ye greatly rejoice" (KJV) takes all that goes before as its
antecedent. Christians rejoice in (1) the living hope that has been
made possible by the resurrection of Jesus, (2) the inheritance that is
kept in trust for them in heaven, and (3) the knowledge that God has
stationed a guard around them.
     How is faith made pure and strong? 1 Peter 1:7.

   "Faith, which is more precious than gold, originates not in the
mines of the earth but in heaven. Faith is refined in the crucible of
man's trials. Faith is God's gift to man. God, not man, determines
the value of faith; and he reveals that the goal of man's faith is his
salvation (1:9)."—Simon J. Kistemaker, "Expositions of the Epistles
of Peter and of the Epistle of Jude," in New Testament Commentary
(Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1987), p. 48.
  What is the last-day church invited to receive from the Lord?
Rev. 3:18.

   "Gold tried in the fire" is faith tested by trial. "The assaults of
Satan are strong, his delusions are subtle; but the Lord's eye is
upon His people. Their affliction is great, the flames of the furnace
seem about to consume them; but Jesus will bring them forth as
gold tried in the fire. Their earthliness will be removed, that
through them the image of Christ may be perfectly revealed."—
Prophets and Kings, p. 589.
   Have the trials and temptations of life strengthened or
weakened your faith? Why? If your faith has not grown, what
changes do you think you can make to ensure that it grows in
the future?

FAITH IS NOT SIGHT (1 Peter 1:8).
   What motivates people to believe in Jesus and love Him, even
though they have never seen Him (1 Peter 1:8)? John 14:16-20; 16:14.

   The believers to whom Peter was writing had not enjoyed his
experience of associating with Christ on earth. Though buoyed up
by their expectation of seeing their living Lord at His "appearing"
(1 Peter 1:7), they had never yet seen Him. Even so, they loved
Him sincerely and rejoiced in His fellowship "with joy unspeak-
able and full of glory" (1 Peter 1:8). Why? The only reasonable
explanation is that Christ's presence and power were made real to
them by the inner working of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit's presence
in the heart of the believer is the presence of Christ (John 14:18).
He instructs regarding Christ's character and conveys His good-
ness.
   How does the experience of Thomas illustrate the point of
1 Peter 1:8? John 20:24-29.

   Thomas had been given evidence that Jesus had risen. (See John
20:18; Matt. 28:9, 10; Luke 24:34.)
   But Thomas determined not to believe unless he saw Jesus for
himself and could verify the fact that it was indeed the crucified
Lord (John 20:25). We fault Thomas for his unbelief, but the posi-
tion he took reflects the attitude of the other apostles recorded in
the Gospels.
   For example, when the women reported their encounter with
the risen Lord, the apostles looked upon their experience as an idle
tale (Luke 24:11). It was not until what they heard was confirmed
by what they saw that they believed. Likewise the Emmaus disci-
ples had heard the report of the women (Luke 24:22, 23), but they
remained in doubt (verses 21, 25) until Jesus made Himself known
to them (verses 30, 31). Only then did they believe (verses 32-35).
   Although Jesus rejoices over those who believe in Him, no mat-
ter how faith may come, He had wished that Thomas would ac-
cept the testimony of his brethren. "Blessed are they that have not
seen, and yet have believed" (John 20:29).

   What does Jesus' reaction to doubting Thomas indicate our
attitude should be toward those who do not believe?

                                                                  29
                                                               July 21

THE RESULTS OF FAITH (1 Peter 1:9).
   What is the end result of the faith of those who love the One
they have not seen? 1 Peter 1:9.

   One major focus of Peter's comment is the second coming of
Christ, at which time faith will meet its fruition. Peter had already
reminded his readers that, because of their faith, they were
"shielded by God's power until the coming of the salvation that is
ready to be revealed in the last time" (1 Peter 1:5, NIV; compare
verse 7). This is a prevalent New Testament motif. (See 2 Tim. 4:7;
Heb. 11:13-16, 39, 40; James 2:5.)
  In what sense is the "goal of your faith, the salvation of your
souls" (1 Peter 1:9, NIV), experienced now?
     Eph. 2:8-10
     Eph. 3:17-19
     Phil. 3:9
     1 Tim. 6:12
   The New International Version correctly translates the Greek of
1 Peter 1:9: "for you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation
of your souls." Because we receive by faith the saving grace of
Jesus, we enjoy the blessings of present salvation. "We have been
born anew to a living hope" (1 Peter 1:3, RSV). Jesus spoke of the
kingdom in existence now. "The kingdom of God is come unto
you" (Matt. 12:28). "The kingdom of God is within you" (Luke
17:21). The subjects of the kingdom of grace have Christ reigning
in their hearts by the presence of the Holy Spirit (Eph. 3:16, 17).
For them the blessings of eternal life have begun (John 3:36; 1 John
5:11-13).
   The ultimate goal of our faith is the eternal, heavenly kingdom
of glory, where we receive our "inheritance which is imperishable,
undefiled, and unfading" (1 Peter 1:4, RSV). Jesus said, "My king-
dom is not of this world" (John 18:36). What a delightful paradox!
Christ's kingdom is in our hearts, but it is still future. We relish
now the joys of salvation, but look expectantly for the ultimate
thrill of final salvation, "the redemption of our body" (Rom. 8:23).
     In what ways can you say that heaven has begun for you?

THE FAITH OF THE PROPHETS (1 Peter 1:10, 11).
   What do you and the inspired prophets have in common?
1 Peter 1:10.

   A quest for knowledge. Two things should be kept in mind
when seeking to understand the prophets' desire to know the mys-
teries of God.
   1.God did not reveal every detail of His plans to each prophet
through whom He communicated with His people. Details were
given, rather, through various prophets. So we find Daniel study-
ing the writings of Jeremiah (Daniel 9:2) in order to understand
when God proposed to bring the Jewish exiles home from
Babylonian captivity.
   2. The prophets did not always understand the full significance
of what they were shown in vision and were inspired to write out.
"Even the prophets who were favored with the special illumina-
tion of the Spirit did not fully comprehend the import of the rev-
elations committed to them. The meaning was to be unfolded from
age to age, as the people of God should need the instruction
therein contained."—The Great Controversy, p. 344.
   Thus the prophets had to search the Scriptures just as we do, in
order to understand God's will and the plan of salvation.
   What particular details of God's plan were the prophets trying
to understand? 1 Peter 1:11.

    Phillips paraphrases the verse: "They tried hard to discover to
what time and to what sort of circumstances the Spirit of Christ
working in them was referring. For he foretold the sufferings of
Christ and the glories that should follow them." First, the prophets
inquired into the how of the Messiah's suffering and glorification.
Second, Peter says the prophets wanted to know when the Messiah
would suffer the things they were inspired to write about, and
when He would be glorified. What an advantage we have not only
being able to read the prophecies of the coming Messiah, but to
read the Gospel record and to see how these prophecies were ful-
filled!
  Even though the prophets did not fully understand the mes-
sages they were given, what evidence do we have that those mes-
sages are trustworthy?
                                                                 31
                                                            July 23
TO WHOM DID THE PROPHETS MINISTER? (1 Peter 1:12).
   What were the prophets told regarding the people for whom
their writings were intended? 1 Peter 1:12.

   To a certain extent the prophets understood what they wrote.
But, because there were gaps in their understanding, they studied
their own writings and those of other prophets in an attempt to fill
in these gaps. (Compare Daniel 8 and 9.)
   When Daniel questioned the angel about the meaning of some
of the things he had been shown in vision, what was the angel's
reply? Daniel 12:9, 10, 13.

   After receiving the revelation, he was told to be content with
simply writing out the vision. It was not necessary for him to
understand its meaning. It was to be the privilege of another gen-
eration to understand it.
   What did the angel mean when he told Daniel that he will
stand in his "allotted place at the end of the days" (Dan. 12:13,
RSV)? Compare Revelation 10 with 14:6-12.

    "After these seven thunders uttered their voices, the injunction
comes to John as to Daniel in regard to the little book: 'Seal up
those things which the seven thunders uttered.' [Rev. 10:3, 41
These relate to future events which will be disclosed in their order.
Daniel shall stand in his lot at the end of the days. John sees the
little book unsealed. Then Daniel's prophecies have their proper
place in the first, second, and third angels' messages to be given to
the world."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 7, p. 971.
  Who besides prophets and people wish to have a deeper
understanding of God's plan to redeem sinners? 1 Peter 1:12, last
part.

  Because the prophets wrote for future generations, which
would see the fulfillment of their predictions, need Christians
have any doubt about the validity of predictive prophecy? What
does the fulfillment of prophecy do for your faith?

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Consider the work of
the Holy Spirit in inspiring the prophets: Zech. 7:12; 1 Cor. 2:4;
Eph. 3:5; 2 Peter 1:21. Read "Light Through Darkness" in The Great
Controversy, pp. 343-354.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
   Peter tells us of the interest on the part of prophets and angels
in God's plan for the redemption of man. What special interest
should we take in the following aspects of God's plan? Why?
  The importance of Christ's life on earth.
  The reason for Christ's sufferings on the cross.
  Bearing the image of God.
  Possessing genuine faith and love.
  Understanding and experiencing God's forgiveness.
  Victory over besetting sins.
  The means by which the Lord plans to finish His work in the
earth.
SUMMARY: Peter completes the first part of his Epistle by dealing
with the role of the Holy Spirit as the agent of inspiration and
revelation. Through His work we have been given the infallible
guide to heaven—the Bible. What He inspired chosen men to write
has opened to our understanding, not only His own role in the
plan of salvation but the roles of the Father and the Son—mys-
teries into which even the angels desire to look.

           Call to Holy Living



&Oa‘71ftentoott
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Peter 1:13-25.
     MEMORY TEXT: "Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not re-
     deemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your
     vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; but
     with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blem-
     ish and without spot" (1 Peter 1:18, 19).
  KEY THOUGHT. Peter reminds us that the ransom paid for our
redemption is beyond monetary value; neither silver nor gold can
be compared to the value of the blood of Jesus, which has ran-
somed us from the power of sin. The ransom price indicates how
valuable we are to God.
   THE BEGINNING OF HOLINESS. Peter never forgot the day
Jesus invited him to go fishing (Luke 5:1-11). Experience and knowl-
edge of fish habits told Peter that the proposed fishing trip would be
unsuccessful. We can understand Peter's utter amazement when he
dropped the net exactly where Jesus indicated and it filled with fish
to the point of tearing. Recognizing that he was in the presence of the
Messiah, Peter fell to his knees and confessed: "Depart from me; for I
am a sinful man, 0 Lord" (Luke 5:8).
   After Peter's confession, Jesus called him to service: "And Jesus
said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men"
(Luke 5:10). Only after the recognition and admission of our sinful-
ness can we hear God's call to holiness and service. Any holiness
we think we possess before making a genuine confession like
Peter's is a holiness that exists only in our own eyes.

IMPERATIVES FOR CHRISTIAN LIVING (1 Peter 1:13).
   Throughout 1 Peter 1:13-16, Peter presents a series of im-
peratives for nobler, holier Christian living. Although the impera-
tive form is used to issue commands, it also is used to entreat
people to action. Paul A. Cedar suggests that these imperatives
embrace three steps that are to be followed if the Christian is to
live a life of holiness: (1) be prepared (verse 13); (2) be obedient
(verse 14); and (3) be holy (verses 15, 16). (See The Communicator's
Commentary: James, 1, 2 Peter, Jude [Waco, Texas: Word Books, Pub-
lishers, 1984], pp. 123-126.)
  What is the first command given by Peter? 1 Peter 1:13.

   Girding up the loins is a procedure that is foreign to Westerners
but familiar to those who live in areas of the world where long
robes are worn. When it is time for serious work, the skirt of the
robe is gathered up and tucked under the girdle, or belt, around
the waist. This leaves the limbs free for vigorous activity.
   In entreating us to gird up the loins of the mind, Peter is calling
us to serious spiritual activity.
   "The mind should be guarded carefully. Nothing should be al-
lowed to enter that will harm or destroy its healthy vigor. But to
prevent this, it should be preoccupied with good seed, which,
springing to life, will bring forth fruit-bearing branches."—My Life
Today, p. 83. (See Phil. 4:8.)
   What else does Peter entreat his readers to do? 1 Peter 1:13.

   Be sober. Peter is calling his readers to vigilance against sin.
That will follow naturally the girding up of the mind. The center of
our spiritual nature resides within the brain. With the mind girded
and the soul on its guard, all of the avenues that lead to the
brain—sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell—will be fortified
against Satan's attempts to use them as vehicles for temptation.
   Hope to the end (KJV). Phillips translates this phrase: "rest the
full weight of your hopes." Peter is admonishing us to have com-
plete, perfect hope in the final realization of God's grace.
  To what extent is your mind under the control of the Holy
Spirit? How can the thoughts that we entertain be completely
under His divine control? (See 2 Cor. 10:4, 5.)

                                                                   35

gOnde
HOLY CONDUCT (1 Peter 1:14-16).
   Wishing to protect their new experience from the defilement
of sin, what does Peter command his readers to do? 1 Peter 1:14.

   Obedient children or children of obedience? The Greek text
reads "children of obedience." "Obedient children" seems to con-
vey the idea of yielding to the wishes of a superior. The act of
obedience may be voluntary, or it may be done grudgingly. On the
other hand, "children of obedience" seems to convey the idea that
obedience comes from the heart and has become a spontaneous
part of the lifestyle. There is truth in both phrases.
   "The heart is united with His heart, the will is merged in His will,
the mind becomes one with His mind, the thoughts are brought into
captivity to Him; we live His life. This is what it means to be clothed
with the garment of His righteousness."—Christ's Object Lessons, p.
312. Obedience has become part of our experience.
   Peter's concern that the children of obedience guard themselves
against the danger of slipping back into their former lifestyle is an
argument against the notion of once-saved-always-saved.
  To what does God call us? 1 Peter 1:15, 16 (compare Matt. 5:48;
Luke 6:36).

   The word translated "conversation" (verse 15, KJV) means
"conduct," "behavior." The instruction is that we are to emulate
Jesus by being holy in everything we do. God commanded Israel
on several occasions, "You shall be holy, for I am holy" (Lev.
11:44, 45; 19:2; 20:7, RSV). God is calling us, as His children, to an
experience in which our fallen human natures, our love for and
bent to sinning, will be conquered and controlled by the Holy
Spirit. We are to bear the image of His Son.
   Expel sin. "The expulsion of sin is the act of the soul itself.
True, we have no power to free ourselves from Satan's control; but
when we desire to be set free from sin, and in our great need cry
out for a power out of and above ourselves, the powers of the soul
are imbued with the divine energy of the Holy Spirit, and they
obey the dictates of the will in fulfilling the will of God."—The
Desire of Ages, p. 466. (See Rom. 8:13.)
  Can you testify to your fellow Sabbath School class members
how God has given you victory over sin?

RANSOMED BY CHRIST'S BLOOD (1 Peter 1:17-19).
  What quality does God possess as judge? 1 Peter 1:17.
   Peter begins this section of our study by giving the reason why
we should live out our time here on earth in a sober and circum-
spect manner. The One we call Father is also judge.
   The child-Father relationship is carried over from verses 13-16.
As children of obedience, we have nothing to fear from our Father-
Judge or from the Son, to whom the Father has committed the
work of judging. (See John 5:22; Acts 17:31.) He judges with perfect
justice and impartiality. In fact, we can face the judgment with as-
surance, knowing that our wills are merged with the will of Jesus,
our minds one with His mind. Thus when the Father sits as judge,
He sees the image of His beloved Son. (Compare 1 John 4:17.)
   Strangers and pilgrims. The Greek word translated "so-
journing" (paroikia) gives a picture of one who is a temporary
resident—a pilgrim. From this word we derive the English word
parochial and the concept that is included in the word parish. The
idea of being pilgrims or wanderers is tied to the wilderness
experience of Israel. We are to pass the time of our sojourn in
earth's wilderness in a state of preparedness, ready for final de-
liverance.
   What was the price paid for our ransom from sin? 1 Peter 1:18,
19.

   The ransom was not paid to Satan; God did not strike a deal
with him. The ransom (price of release) Jesus paid on the cross for
our sins involved His suffering our penalty for disobeying His law.
He endured the infinite agony of separation from His Father—sep-
aration that seemed to Him to be eternal. (See 1 Peter 2:24; 1 John
2:2; Isa. 53:5, 6.)
   Peter compares the ransom price, the blood of Jesus, to that of a
lamb without blemish or spot. His words allude to the Passover
service. The Passover lamb that symbolized Jesus was to be with-
out blemish. (See Ex. 12:5.) Its shed blood "ransomed" the Israel-
ites from the plague of death that ravished Egypt and provided for
their deliverance.
  What does Calvary mean to you? Make a mental list of the
practical aspects of your life that would be drastically different if
you had not accepted Christ's death for you.

THE BASIS OF OUR CONFIDENCE (1 Peter 1:20, 21).
  When were the arrangements for the sacrifice of the Lamb
made? 1 Peter 1:20 (Rev. 13:8; Acts 2:23; 1 Cor. 2:7).

   Sin did not catch God unprepared. Before the creation of this
world God foresaw the rise of sin and its ultimate end.
"Foreordained" in the KJV and "destined" in the RSV mean that
God decided beforehand that His Son would die for the sins of the
world. This does not mean that He predetermined the sin of man-
kind or that He rendered it impossible for Christ to fail in His mis-
sion. What God foresees He does not necessarily decree.
    "God had a knowledge of the events of the future, even
before the creation of the world. He did not make His purposes
to fit circumstances, but He allowed matters to develop and
work out. He did not work to bring about a certain condition of
things, but He knew that such a condition would exist. The plan
that should be carried out upon the defection of any of the high
intelligences of heaven—this is the secret, the mystery which has
been hid from ages. And an offering was prepared in the eternal
purposes to do the very work which God has done for fallen
humanity."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 6, p. 1082.
   "Manifest at the end of the times" (RSV). Although the ar-
rangements for the sacrifice were made in eternity past, before the
world was created, the Lamb did not appear on earth until the
appointed time. (See Gal. 4:4.) Peter refers to this event as taking
place in the "last times" (1 Peter 1:20). The fulfillment of the Old
Testament prophecies—the coming of the Messiah, His sacrifice,
the giving of the Holy Spirit—was seen as evidence by the early
Christians that they were living in the last age.
   How does Peter reiterate the basis of our faith and hope?
1 Peter 1:21.

   We have not seen Jesus with the natural eye (1 Peter 1:8); we
were not there at the time of His resurrection; yet we believe He
lives. Our faith and hope are in God.
  If you were asked to give the reason for your faith and hope,
what would you say? What evidence would you give to encour-
age a nonbeliever to accept your faith and hope?

BORN AGAIN (1 Peter 1:22-25).
  What is a most convincing evidence that a person has been
born again? 1 Peter 1:22.

   Before Jesus' death the apostles had deep-seated jealousy toward
one another, engaging in bitter competition over who was to be
greatest in Jesus' kingdom. Jesus reminded them that those who are
fit for His kingdom have a different spirit. "For he who is least
among you all," Jesus said, "is the one who is great" (Luke 9:48,
RSV).
   The preparation for Pentecost. During the days between Jesus'
ascension and the Day of Pentecost, the apostles followed certain
steps to prepare their hearts for the promised Gift of God. One of
these steps was making things right with fellow disciples. "Putting
away all differences, all desire for the supremacy, they came close
together in Christian fellowship."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 37.
    Genuine love for brethren and sisters is the most persuasive
evidence that a Christian has been born again. Peter says that a
born-again Christian will love others with sincere love. There will
be no hypocritical display.
  By what means are Christians born again? 1 Peter 1:23-25.

   Like good seed sown in a field, God's Word is planted in the
human heart by the Holy Spirit. It produces a harvest of souls for
God's kingdom. As the grass and its flower come and go, so do
people, but the Word of God continues on, doing its saving work
in willing hearts.
  What experience do believers enjoy as long as they allow the
Holy Spirit to reign in their hearts? 1 John 3:3-9.

   Peter's message in 1 Peter 2:22, 23 parallels that of John. Peter
says that obedience to the truth is "through the Spirit" made possi-
ble by the born-again experience in which the incorruptible Word
of God takes possession of the willing human mind. John empha-
sizes that as long as the Seed, the Holy Spirit, possesses the heart,
sin cannot dwell there (1 John 3:9; compare 1 John 5:18).
  How do we know that the Holy Spirit is reigning in our
hearts?

                                                                  39

FURTHER STUDY: Compare the messages in Romans 8 and
1 John 3 with the message of 1 Peter 1:13-25. Read "Consecration"
and "The Test of Discipleship" in Steps to Christ, pp. 43-48; 57-65.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Why is it perilous to depend only on "impressions" about
     what you should or should not do? How does this week's
     lesson establish that the Holy Spirit uses the Word of God to
     keep us in the faith?
     2. How would you answer a person who says that, because
        Jesus was "foreordained before the foundation of the world"
        (1 Peter 1:20), His victory over the devil was decreed and it
        was impossible for Him to sin? How do you establish that
        Jesus was our example in the battle with sin?
     3. What does Peter's remark about "perishable things such as
        silver or gold" (1 Peter 1:18, RSV) imply regarding the danger
        of materialism?
     4. Your next-door neighbor has no confidence in the Bible. She
        is a divorcee who has no time for religion. How would you
        go about leading her to believe in the truth and power of the
        Word of God?
SUMMARY: Peter uses a series of imperatives to invite his readers
to prepare for the coming of Jesus. Ransomed by the blood of
God's Passover Lamb and born again through the power of the
Word, all children of obedience have confidence as they are judged
by their heavenly Father. Because their conduct is directed by the
Holy Spirit, they are kept from sinning. Their lives are consistent
with the principles of the Word of God.

             God's Showcase




&Heft,Aftentom
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Peter 2:1-10.
  MEMORY TEXT: "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal
  priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should
  shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of
  darkness into his marvellous light" (1 Peter 2:9).
   KEY THOUGHT. From a heterogeneous group of sinful people
representing all nations of earth, Christ has fashioned a chosen
race, a royal priesthood, a new and holy nation. Who would spurn
the chance to be counted as one of its citizens, as one of God's own
people?
   GOD'S CROWN JEWELS. Behind the walls of the Tower of
London, tucked away in the basement of an old building, is an
underground vault. Big enough to accommodate two lines of pass-
ing tourists, the vault contains a large circular glass case. Within
this case are displayed the crown jewels of England. Wide-eyed
tourists circle the display case in double rows viewing the heavily
jeweled coronation crowns, jewel-bedecked ceremonial swords,
and other objects of earthly splendor, symbols of power and roy-
alty in England for centuries.
   God also has a display case that is easily accessible for all the
world to marvel at. It is a spiritual house made up of all kinds of
gems—living stones, people who reflect God's wonderful power
and deeds.
                                                                  41

HOW ARE SINS LAID ASIDE? (1 Peter 2:1).
   Peter now deals with the living stones that must square up with
the great Cornerstone if they are to fulfill God's purpose to build a
spiritual house. Verse 1 lists sins offensive to God.
   Who has the responsibility of ridding the life of these sins?
1 Peter 2:1, 2.

   The power to conquer sin comes from God. The will to have
this power comes from the individual. Therefore, Peter informs his
readers that they are responsible for laying aside sinful acts. Paul
also emphasizes the responsibility of the individual in conquering
sin when he says, "But if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds
of the body you will live" (Rom. 8:13, RSV).
   "The expulsion of sin is the act of the soul itself. True, we have no
power to free ourselves from Satan's control; but when we desire to
be set free from sin, and in our great need cry out for a power out of
and above ourselves, the powers of the soul are imbued with the di-
vine energy of the Holy Spirit, and they obey the dictates of the will
in fulfilling the will of God."—The Desire of Ages, p. 466.
   What evidence do we have that victory over sin in the lives of
Jesus' followers is not only possible, but imperative? Rom. 6:14;
2 Cor. 7:1; Rev. 3:2, 5.

    Notice the three steps by which the soul expels sin:
   1. Rom. 8:9, 10. The powers of the soul are energized by the
Holy Spirit. "The soul must submit to God before it can be re-
newed in holiness."—Steps to Christ, p. 43.
    2.Phil. 4:13. The powers of the soul obey the dictates of the human
will. "What you need to understand is the true force of the will. This
is the governing power in the nature of man. . . . Everything depends
on the right action of the will."—Steps to Christ, p. 47.
   3. Rom. 8:13, 14. The human will fulfills the will of God because
it has become an extension of His will. "When we submit our-
selves to Christ . . . the will is merged in His will."—Christ's Object
Lessons, p. 312.
  How successful have you been in ridding sin from your life?
In light of the above, explain Christ's part and our part in the
process by which we obtain victory.

THE POWER OF THE WORD (1 Peter 2:1-3).
  Why are the sins listed in 1 Peter 2:1 especially offensive to
God?

   Malice: Intent to injure.
   Guile: The Greek word literally means "fish bait." Something
that is intended to do harm (the fish hook) is clothed in something
that appears attractive (the bait).
   Hypocrisy: Veiling true feelings or actions with intent to de-
ceive.
   Envy: Feelings of ill will toward another, who possesses some-
thing we desire.
   Evil speaking (slander): Deliberately harming a person in the
eyes of others by the use of words.
   These sins create an atmosphere that drives away the Holy
Spirit. God's sealed people in the last days will be free of these
sins. (See Rev. 14:5, NIV.)
  What food are Christians to live on as the means of spiritual
growth? 1 Peter 2:2.

  Milk and meat. Paul made a distinction between the milk of the
Word intended for infants in the Christian life and the meat of the
Word for mature Christians. (See Heb. 5:12-14.) Peter's point is
that, at every stage of spiritual growth, Christians are to crave
God's Word as infants crave physical nourishment.
  How powerful is God's Word when we are armed with it in
our battle against sin? Eph. 6:17; Heb. 4:12.

   Many people professing to believe the Bible replace its guidance
with inner impressions, supposed to come from God, but which
come from other sources. (See Will Baron, Deceived by the New Age,
[Boise, Idaho: Pacific Press, 1990.]) The Holy Spirit works through
the Word to give us victory over sin. Our only safety is in daily
study of the Word. Minds fortified by the Word, interpreted to
them by the Spirit, are impregnable to the assaults of Satan.
  How important is God's Word to you? Do you read it every
day? Do you turn to it when tempted, as Jesus did?

                                                                 43

A SPIRITUAL HOUSE (1 Peter 2:4, 5).
    Peter appeals to a familiar Old Testament motif—a corner-
stone—to help his readers see how their lives, patterned after the
life of Jesus, can be part of God's spiritual temple. The Scriptures
use a rock of defense or a fortress to symbolize God's strength
and saving power for those who trust in Him. (See Ex. 17:6;
1 Cor. 10:4.) Peter uses the Greek word that refers to a stone
worked by craftsmen, shaped for use in construction (1 Peter 2:4).
   How are believers in Christ, as living stones, built into a spir-
itual house? 1 Peter 2:4, 5.

   What constitutes a living stone? Fellowship with Christ results
in likeness to Him. "It is not a form of godliness, nor a name upon
the church records, that constitutes 'a living stone' in the spiritual
building. It is being renewed in knowledge and true holiness,
being crucified to the world and made alive in Christ, that unites
the soul to God."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 168.
   Stones from the quarry. We are rough stones taken from the
quarry of sin. Through His truth and our life's experiences, God
shapes us to fit into the living, spiritual temple He is building.
Each stone must be squared with the great Cornerstone so as to
emulate His beauty.
   Is one stone of more value than another? "Elevated position
has no power to sanctify the heart. God permits them to hold these
positions that He may prove whether they will reveal the character
of God or the character of weak, finite humanity, which has never
been fully under God's discipline; but positions have no power to
develop a man's character. It rests wholly with the man himself to
prove whether he will work himself, which means that Satan will
work him, or whether he will be worked by the Holy Spirit."—Tes-
timonies to Ministers, p. 288.
   Holy priesthood. The living stones that are built into the spir-
itual house form a holy priesthood that offers spiritual sacrifices.

   After reading the following texts, how would you define a
spiritual sacrifice? Ps. 51:17; Rom. 12:1; Heb. 13:15, 16.

  As part of God's "holy priesthood," what contribution are you
making to its spiritual ministry?

THE CORNERSTONE (1 Peter 2:6, 8).
  How do the following Old Testament prophecies quoted by
Peter apply to Jesus?
  Isa. 28:16 (1 Peter 2:6)
  Ps. 118:22 (1 Peter 2:7)
  Isa. 8:14 (1 Peter 2:8)
   Fulfillment in Jesus. "For use in the foundation [of Solomon's
temple], one stone of unusual size and peculiar shape had been
brought; but the workmen could find no place for it, and would
not accept it. . . . But at last attention was called to the stone so
long rejected. It had been exposed to the air, to sun and storm,
without revealing the slightest crack. The builders examined this
stone. It had borne every test but one. If it could bear the test of
severe pressure, they decided to accept it for the cornerstone. The
trial was made. The stone was accepted, brought to its assigned
position, and found to be an exact fit. In prophetic vision, Isaiah
was shown that this stone was a symbol of Christ."—The Desire of
Ages, p. 598.
   In what way did Jesus apply this prophecy to Himself? Matt.
21:42, 43.

   Peter identified the spiritual leaders of the chosen nation as the
builders who rejected the divinely chosen Cornerstone. (See Acts
4:6-12.)
    Two roles played by the cornerstone in the construction of
ancient buildings symbolize Jesus' work.
   1. All other stones used in construction were squared with the
cornerstone. This stone determined the design and shape of the
building. Therefore, all other stones placed in the structure of the
spiritual house being built by God must reflect the design and ap-
pearance of the Cornerstone.
   2. Jesus is also the foundation upon which the spiritual house is
built (1 Cor. 3:10, 11). The apostles and the prophets are referred to
as the foundation of God's holy temple because they present Jesus
to sinners as the basis of their faith and salvation (Eph. 2:19-22).
  List the practical ways in which your life reveals Jesus as its
Cornerstone.
                                                                   45

A HOLY NATION (1 Peter 2:8-10).
  What are the results of the ways in which people relate to the
Cornerstone? 1 Peter 2:8; Luke 20:17, 18.

   "To fall upon the Rock and be broken is to give up our self-
righteousness and to go to Christ with the humility of a child, re-
penting of our transgressions, and believing in His forgiving
love."—The Desire of Ages, p. 599. To those who reject Him, Jesus
becomes a Rock of offense. Those who respond in repentance and
surrender will live with Him forever.
   List the characteristics once ascribed to ancient Israel, and
then compare them with 1 Peter 2:9.
     Ex. 19:6
     Deut. 7:6
   The new Israel. The New Testament teaches that God's plan
did not fail when the chosen people rejected the Messiah. The
apostles and their converts are described in the same terms once
given to ancient Israel. (Compare Gal. 3:7-9, 26-29.)
   The characteristics of believers in Christ. "Like Israel of old,
the church is a chosen people (see Isa. 43:20). . . . The church is also a
royal priesthood (Exod. 19:6). Every member is a priest because he
has direct access to God. . . . Israel was a holy nation because it was
set apart or consecrated to the service of God (Exod. 19:6). . . . By
the new birth all believers become one race. Their distinguishing
characteristic is that they are 'holy'—separate from sin and set
apart for God and his purposes. They are, therefore, a people belong-
ing to God (Isa. 43:21). The AV translation, 'peculiar people,' has
raised many an eyebrow because all too often Christians are
'peculiar' in the wrong way. The NEB translates, 'a people claimed
by God for his own.' . . . In a Philadelphia museum you can see a
pair of glasses that belonged to Thomas Edison. Their worth de-
rives from ownership. We are people who belong to God."—Rob-
ert H. Mounce, A Living Hope: A Commentary on 1 and 2 Peter
(Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1982), pp. 28, 29.
   What Old Testament prophecy dealing with the covenant peo-
ple does Peter apply to Christian believers? 1 Peter 2:10; Hosea
2:23.

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read what the New
Testament teaches about believers as God's spiritual temple: 1 Cor.
3:16; 6:19; 2 Cor. 6:16; Eph. 2:20-22; Heb. 3:6. Read "The Temple
Cleansed Again," The Desire of Ages, pp. 589-600.
   "In infinite wisdom, God chose the foundation stone, and laid it
Himself. He called it 'a sure foundation.' The entire world may lay
upon it their burdens and griefs; it can endure them all. With per-
fect safety they may build upon it. Christ is a 'tried stone.' Those
who trust in Him, He never disappoints. He has borne every test.
He has endured the pressure of Adam's guilt, and the guilt of his
posterity, and has come off more than conqueror of the powers of
evil. He has borne the burdens cast upon Him by every repenting
sinner. In Christ the guilty heart has found relief. He is the sure
foundation. All who make Him their dependence rest in perfect
security."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 598, 599.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Am I a living stone in the spiritual house God is building?
     How can I tell whether my life is squaring up with the
     Cornerstone?
  2. If I see myself as a member of God's modern covenant peo-
     ple, how can I reveal to the world the beauty of His charac-
     ter?
   3. Peter teaches the priesthood of all believers. Why then does
      God ordain ministers with special functions in the church?
   4. A fellow church member confides in you: "1 Peter 2:9 indi-
      cates that we should be holy. I am not holy. I have habits that
      are very unholy. How can I become holy?" What answer
      would you give? (See 1 Thess. 3:12, 13; 1 Peter 1:2; 1 Cor. 6:11;
      Heb. 12:10, 14.)
SUMMARY: Peter calls upon Christians everywhere to lay aside
sin. They are to be building blocks in God's living temple, reflect-
ing the glory of the Cornerstone. The followers of Jesus are the
new Israel, the new-covenant people, bearing all the identifying
spiritual characteristics that once were borne by Israel of old.

READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Peter 2:11-20.
     MEMORY TEXT: "Having your conversation honest among
     the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evil-
     doers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold,
     glorify God in the day of visitation" (1 Peter 2:12).
  KEY THOUGHT. As earthly representatives of the heavenly
King, Christians are to introduce Jesus to everyone they meet by
modeling His life in their own daily living.
   THE POWER OF EXAMPLE. Brother Smith was the local elder
of a small congregation in a New England town. The pastor had
known him only as a faithful lay leader. From people who lived in
the town he had heard that, prior to becoming a Seventh-day Ad-
ventist, Brother Smith had been a difficult man. One day the
elder's wife told the pastor how her husband had once been thor-
oughly mean. But Jesus had changed his life completely. A few
years after his baptism, his mother-in-law, deeply impressed by the
changes in his life, gave her heart to Jesus and was baptized. Until
her death, the mother-in-law maintained that it was the change she
witnessed in her son-in-law's life that convinced her to surrender
her life to the Saviour.
   In the pastoral section beginning at 1 Peter 2:11, 12, Peter deals
with the power for good that is radiated by a dedicated Christian
life and with the duties of the Christian as a citizen.

WARNING AGAINST THE FALLEN NATURE (1 Peter 2:11).
  Why are Christians to war against "fleshly lusts"? 1 Peter 2:11.

   The word flesh, as Peter uses it here, stands for the fallen human
nature that, for the believer, is controlled by the Holy Spirit.
"Many regard this text as warning against licentiousness only; but
it has a broader meaning. It forbids every injurious gratification of
appetite or passion."—Counsels on Diet and Foods, p. 167. Fleshly
lusts are the cravings of the fallen nature that seek satisfaction in
sinful indulgences.
    Paul spoke of the inner struggle of the born-again Christian:
"For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires
of the Spirit are against the flesh" (Gal. 5:17, RSV).
    The Christian believer is counseled: "Walk by the Spirit, and do
not gratify the desires of the flesh" (Gal. 5:16, RSV). If you choose
to be "led by the Spirit" your life is kept in harmony with God's
law (Gal. 5:18; compare Rom. 8:3, 4).
  How do we successfully war against the desires of our fallen,
human natures? Rom. 7:25; 8:2, 12-14.

    There was a time when Paul was habitually giving in to the
desires of his fallen self. (See Rom. 7:14, 18, 23.) Then he learned to
depend on Christ for victory. Because of Christ's death, Paul could
be delivered by the Spirit from yielding to the flesh.
    The fallen self still remains after we submit to Christ, but now
it is under the control of the Holy Spirit. "Paul's sanctification was
a constant conflict with self. Said he: 'I die daily.' His will and his
desires every day conflicted with duty and the will of God. Instead
of following inclination, he did the will of God, however unpleasant and
crucifying to his nature."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 299. (Italics sup-
plied.)
    Three prayers. When we are tempted to give in to our fallen
humanity, we should immediately pray three prayers: (1) Lord, I
am helpless; I like this thing. (You would not be tempted if you
did not like it.) (2) But Lord, it is wrong. Please give me the victory
over it. (3) Thank You, Lord; I believe You have given me the
victory.
   In your warfare against your fallen humanity, are you having
victory in Christ? If not, why not?

                                                                     49

LIFE AMONG UNBELIEVERS (1 Peter 2:12).
   What principle should control the manner in which Christians
live among those who do not believe in Christ? 1 Peter 2:12.

   The Revised Standard Version translates the text: "Maintain
good conduct among the Gentiles, so that in case they speak
against you as wrongdoers, they may see your good deeds and
glorify God on the day of visitation."
   God's chosen people. In last week's lesson, we found that Peter
went to great lengths to emphasize the New Testament teaching
that believers in Jesus are now "a chosen race, a royal priesthood,
a holy nation, God's own people" (1 Peter 2:9, RSV). Therefore,
they are to represent Him by a lifestyle consistent with His teach-
ings.
   The word translated "conversation" in the King James Version
means "behavior" or "conduct." God's chosen people now are
called to succeed where His Old Testament people failed. (See
Rom. 2:24.) An honest lifestyle among our unbelieving neighbors
will bring praise to our God.
   According to Jesus, what is the purpose of a consistent Chris-
tian lifestyle? Matt. 5:16.

   As Peter wrote his Epistle, Christians were being maligned by
non-Christians, largely because they were misunderstood. Some of
the accusations leveled against Christians that led to misunder-
standing were these:
   1.The Christians despised the Roman gods.
   2.Christian exclusiveness demonstrated hatred for humanity.
   3. The Lord's Supper was an occasion of immoral conduct.
   4. Family relationships were tampered with.
   5.Slaves were turned against their masters.
   6. Disloyalty was shown toward Caesar and the state.
   Peter was convinced that a consistent Christian lifestyle of good
works would correct these misunderstandings and lead detractors
to glorify God on "the day of visitation" (1 Peter 2:12).
  List the kinds of behavior by church members today that are
sure to misrepresent the gospel. Now list the kinds of service in
which church members can engage that will reduce prejudice.

DUTIES OF CITIZENSHIP (1 Peter 2:13, 14).
  What reason does Peter give for his counsel regarding a
Christian's relationship to the state? 1 Peter 2:13, 14 (compare
Rom. 13:1-7; The Desire of Ages, p. 509).

   "Christians should acknowledge the sovereignty of the divine
providence in ordering and overruling human institutions and rela-
tions for men's good. The way, therefore, to please God, to serve His
will, and to experience His blessing, is for Christians not to be rebels
against the prevailing order of society, but rather positively, submis-
sively and dutifully to discharge the various responsibilities which
the common relations of life put upon them."—Alan M. Stibbs, Tyn-
dale New Testament Commentaries, on 1 Peter (Grand Rapids, Mich.:
Wm B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1971), p. 106.
   Jesus and the apostles never espoused political causes. (See John
18:36.) The government of that day was thoroughly autocratic and
often unjust. Even so, Jesus submitted to the rule of Caesar (Matt.
22:21), even allowing the Roman authorities to put Him to death.
   Under what circumstances did the apostles exercise nonviolent
resistance to the decrees of rulers? Acts 5:27-32.

   The Bible teaches cooperation with civil authorities except when
their requirements conflict with God's requirements. But Christians
have no warrant for violent resistance.
   Balanced counsel. "We are to recognize human government as
an ordinance of divine appointment, and teach obedience to it as a
sacred duty, within its legitimate sphere. But when its claims
conflict with the claims of God, we must obey God rather than
men. God's word must be recognized as above all human legis-
lation. . . .
   "We are not required to defy authorities. Our words, whether spo-
ken or written, should be carefully considered, lest we place our-
selves on record as uttering that which would make us appear antag-
onistic to law and order. We are not to say or do anything that would
unnecessarily close up our way."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 69.

   In what circumstances do you think it appropriate for Chris-
tians to seek political change? Do you see a role in politics for
church members? How can a Christian politician serve the state
and, at the same time, be true to the gospel commission?
                                                                      51

FREEDOM WITH RESPONSIBILITY (1 Peter 2:15-17).
  By what means are Christians encouraged to make their mark
on society? 1 Peter 2:15.

   Not by verbal or violent opposition to those of contrary political
views are followers of Christ to make their mark. They have a
more exalted mission, the glorification of the Saviour among man-
kind and the proclamation of salvation by His grace.
    "For it is God's will that by doing right you should put to si-
lence the ignorance of foolish men" (1 Peter 2:15, RSV).
   Here is plenty of scope for community involvement. As be-
lievers we are not to be religious hermits, shutting ourselves away
from an evil society. Unbelievers have spiritual, emotional, physi-
cal, and material needs. In the spirit of Jesus, we must be commit-
ted to alleviating human need wherever and whenever the
opportunity presents itself.
     According to 1 Peter 2:16, what does it mean to be free?

    Freedom is a state of mind. "Were you a slave when called?
Never mind. But if you can gain your freedom, avail yourself of
the opportunity. For he who was called in the Lord as a slave is a freed-
man of the Lord" (1 Cor. 7:21, 22, RSV, italics supplied). Those in
bondage to sinful people may have no outward freedom, but their
hearts are free because of their union with Christ.
    Those in bondage to sin and passion may think they are free;
but, in fact, they are slaves. Those in bondage to God have the
highest degree of freedom, as well as the peace that comes with
the knowledge that they are accepted in the name of their Saviour.
(See 1 Cor. 7:22.)
    Only the person in bondage to God is:
   1. free from cultural and racial prejudice and can relate to all
human beings as the product of God's creation;
   2. free from jealousy and the desire for supremacy and can love
all believers as Jesus did;
   3. free from superstition and the bondage of satanic error and
can give to God the reverence due Him;
   4. free from sloth and deceit and can render the best service.
  How are you using your Christian freedom in service for God
and humanity?

PATIENCE WHEN MISTREATED (1 Peter 2:18-20).
   To what type of master might a Christian find himself subser-
vient? 1 Peter 2:18.

   Servants and slaves in the Roman Empire. Peter uses the Greek
word for slave that refers to one who lives in the master's home as
part of the family. This servant may be a freeman, a freewoman, or
a bond slave.
   There were millions of slaves in the Roman world in Peter's
day. At first many were prisoners of war. In New Testament times,
slaves included doctors, teachers, secretaries, musicians, and other
professionally trained people. The early church probably saw
many converts from this social group.
   Christian witness, not revolt. Slavery was a reality that the
early church had to face. New Testament counsel did not call for
social revolt, but for lives consistent with the example of Jesus.
Slaves could lead souls to Christ within their masters' households.
    How is a servant to behave under the hand of a harsh master?
1 Peter 2:19, 20.

    Unfairness in the workplace. Even when slavery does not
 exist, "numerous persons can testify that oppression nevertheless
 takes place today. They experience nonphysical oppression in the
 form of either verbal abuse or unethical rules and dishonest prac-
 tices in their place of work. Quite often they cannot voice their
 grievances for fear of losing their source of income. Furthermore,
 oppression that is nonphysical usually is subtle and elusive, and
 generally cannot be proved. To all those who silently suffer in
 their place of employment Peter says, 'If you suffer for doing
 good and endure it, this is commendable before God.' "—Simon
 J. Kistemaker, New Testament Commentary on 1 Peter (Grand Rap-
 ids, Mich.: Baker Book House, 1987), p. 107.
    Human conflicts need not destroy our fellowship with Christ.
 "We should not allow feelings to be easily wounded. We are to
 live, not to guard our feelings or our reputation, but to save souls.
 As we become interested in the salvation of souls we cease to mind
 the little differences that so often arise in our association with one
 another. Whatever others may think of us or do to us, it need not
 disturb our oneness with Christ, the fellowship of the Spirit."—The
 Ministry of Healing, p. 485.
                                                                    53

FURTHER STUDY: Consider the Bible counsel regarding patience
in suffering: Acts 5:41; Rom. 8:17; Heb. 11:25; James 5:10; 1 Peter
5:10. Read "Meeting Opposition," Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6,

DISCUSSION QUESTION. Peter calls Christians to an exemplary
lifestyle in their communities. Give four areas in which you might
improve your relations with the non-Adventist community in wit-
nessing for Christ:
  1.
  2.
  3.
  4.
SUMMARY: We are strangers and pilgrims in a hostile world. In
this antagonistic environment, the Christian is to weigh carefully
the responsibility he bears to God in his relationships with neigh-
bors, the government, immediate superiors, and those who mis-
treat him. The Christian's lifestyle is to teach others about God's
love, patience, and compassion.

 Walking in His Footsteps




SabhailhAfterman
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Peter 2:20-25.
  MEMORY TEXT: "For even hereunto were ye called: because
  Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye
  should follow his steps" (1 Peter 2:21).
   KEY THOUGHT. Because Christ bore the punishment for our
sins on the cross, He can pardon us, enable us to have victory, and
strengthen us to suffer patiently for Him.
   THE DIVINE IMPERATIVE. Paul A. Cedar introduces his
study of this section of 1 Peter with this story: "Not long ago, I
was leading a small group of professional people in a Bible study
on the Book of James. Within that context, I shared a word study
on the word 'faith' which is so central to the message of James. I
contended that an appropriate Biblical definition for faith is 'active
obedience,' and shared that God has called us to be His obedient
servants. The initial response of those in the group was surprise
and resistance.
   "Like many of us, they had fallen into the self-centered lifestyle.
They did not wish to be servants of anyone nor were they excited
about the lifestyle of obedience. Instead they preferred for God to
fall into the flow of their lives and to subscribe to their wishes.
   "Of course, they were challenging one of the basic requirements
of being a true Christian. To follow Jesus Christ as Lord in obedi-
ence and to serve Him is not an option for authentic Christian life-
style; it is imperative."—The Communicator's Commentary: James,
1, 2 Peter, Jude, p. 148.

                                                                   55

CHRIST'S SINLESS EXAMPLE (1 Peter 2:21, 22).
   What two aspects of Christ's life are we urged to copy? 1 Peter
2:21, 22.

   Some elementary classrooms display on the wall a ribbon of
paper on which are printed the letters of the alphabet. Students
copy the letters and thereby learn proper penmanship. The Greek
word translated "example" suggests a child carefully reproducing
an example. By His life, Jesus left behind examples of the manner
in which He wants His followers to live. He demonstrated patience
in suffering and freedom from all sin.
  What divine standard is given in the following passages for
those who would follow Jesus' example?
     Rom. 6:4-13, 18, 22
     Phil. 2:5
     1 John 3:3-9
     Rev. 3:21
   Victory over sin through the power of the indwelling Christ is
a major emphasis throughout the New Testament. As Jesus over-
came by relying upon His Father for strength, so we can over-
come by relying upon Him. First Peter 2:22 repeats Isaiah 53:9;
Isaiah predicted Christ's sinlessness, Peter beheld it. As there was
no deceit or impurity in Jesus, so there will be none in the lives
of His last-day sealed people. (Compare Rev. 7:3 with Rev.
14:1, 5.)
   We can become like Him. "The path to heaven is no smoother
now than in the days of our Saviour. All our sins must be put
away. Every darling indulgence that hinders our religious life must
be cut off. . . . Are we willing to renounce our own wisdom and to
receive the kingdom of heaven as a little child? Are we willing to
part with self-righteousness? . . . Every association we form, how-
ever limited, exerts some influence upon us. . . . Thus by acquaint-
ance and association with Christ we may become like Him, the one
faultless Example."—Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 222, 223.
     Christlikeness should be our first priority in life. Is it yours?

CHRIST'S PATIENCE IN SUFFERING (1 Peter 2:23).
   How did Jesus relate to unjust condemnation and abuse?
1 Peter 2:23.

   "Peter now emphasizes the remarkable reserve of Jesus during the
period of his final testing. The religious leaders . . . hurled their insults
at him by placing a blindfold over his eyes, spitting at him, and strik-
ing him with their fists, while taunting him to 'prophesy!' (Mark
14:65; see also 15:31-32). The Roman soldiers crowned him with
thorns and mocked him as king (Mark 15:17-20). Even those passing
by the cross in the time of his agony reviled him (Mark 15:29-30).
"How did he respond? With dignified silence. He did not retaliate (see
Mark 14:61; 15:5; Luke 23:9). His cause was just: his suffering unjust.
As the lamb of God he quietly bore the penalty for the sins of man-
kind. Even his tormentors were included within the circle of his for-
giveness."—Robert H. Mounce, A Living Hope, pp. 36, 37.
  In reminding us of Christ's patience in suffering, what point
does Peter want us to see? 1 Peter 2:20, 21.

   Some years ago a boy was stricken with polio that crippled his
legs. Angry and bitter that his only son was afflicted in this way,
the father took to drink and became an alcoholic. Life for his
wife and boy became a veritable nightmare. The mother and son
began to attend church, where they found Christ as Saviour and
Lord.
   One night when the drunken father had beaten his son harshly,
he was impressed by the boy's patience. He asked the lad why he
was acting so calmly. The boy replied, "It's because I love you,
Daddy. God loves you, and so do I!"
   Those words kept coming into the drunkard's mind. One eve-
ning, strongly convicted by the Holy Spirit, he blurted out to his
son, "I want to love you and your mother and God! How can I do
it?" That night the twelve-year-old boy led his father to Christ, and
the dramatic, inevitable change came.—Adapted from Paul A.
Cedar, The Communicator's Commentary: James, 1, 2 Peter, Jude,
p. 150.
  Have you ever seen someone's attitudes change because you
have been patient and kind when abused?

CHRIST OUR SIN-BEARER (1 Peter 2:24, first part).
   What message of Isaiah was repeated by Peter in 1 Peter 2:24?
Isa. 53:4-6, 8, 10-12.

   Christ did not come merely to show us how to die; He came to
save us from death. This He did by taking our guilt upon Himself
and suffering the penalty for it. The ultimate penalty for sin is eter-
nal death. (See Rom. 6:23; Rev. 20:14.) Jesus suffered the equivalent
of this death.
  What do the following passages teach regarding the legal as-
pect of Christ's suffering on the cross?
     1 John 2:2
     1 John 4:10
     Heb. 9:28
     2 Cor. 5:21
    The Greek word translated "propitiation" in 1 John 2:2 and 4:10
is translated "expiation" in the RSV. In context, the word refers to
the sin offering by which Christ bore the responsibility for the sins
of the world.
    Peter teaches that Christ "bore our sins in his body" (1 Peter
2:24, NIV). Because Christ assumed our guilt, His suffering was
terminal. In fact, Christ's physical suffering was minor compared to
the infinite agony involved in His separation from the Father.
    He suffered God's wrath against sin. "Upon Christ as our
substitute and surety was laid the iniquity of us all. He was
counted a transgressor, that He might redeem us from the con-
demnation of the law. The guilt of every descendant of Adam
was pressing upon His heart. The wrath of God against sin, the
terrible manifestation of His displeasure because of iniquity, filled
the soul of His Son with consternation. . . . But now with the
terrible weight of guilt He bears, He cannot see the Father's rec-
onciling face. The withdrawal of the divine countenance from the
Saviour in this hour of supreme anguish pierced His heart with a
sorrow that can never be fully understood by man. So great was
this agony that His physical pain was hardly felt."—The Desire of
Ages, p. 753.

CHRIST OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS (1 Peter 2:24, second part).
  How do we "live unto righteousness" (1 Peter 2:24, second
part)? Consider the following passages:
  1 Cor. 1:30
  Phil. 3:9
  Rom. 3:21, 22
  Rom. 4:5
   The Bible establishes these two major points:
   1.Christ's righteousness is placed to our account,
   2. when we receive Him into our hearts by faith.
   Martin Luther expressed it biblically when he wrote: "Therefore
the Christ who is grasped by faith and who lives in the heart is the
true Christian righteousness, on account of which God counts us
righteous and grants us eternal life."—Luther's Works, Lectures on
Galatians (St. Louis, Mo.: Concordia, 1963), vol. 26, p. 130.
   God never counts sinners righteous who choose to remain in
their sins. He says: "I will not justify the wicked" (Ex. 23:7). When
He justifies the ungodly (Rom. 4:5), it is because the ungodly exer-
cise faith in Him by surrendering their hearts to His control and
indwelling. When Christ places His righteousness to the account of
a repenting, believing sinner, He simultaneously comes into the
heart of that believing soul and becomes his indwelling righteous-
ness. (See Selected Messages, book 1, pp. 366, 397.)
   How does Christ bestow righteousness upon us? Rom. 8:9, 10;
1 John 2:29; 3:7.

   Christ's presence in the heart of the believer is manifested by
the presence of the Holy Spirit. (See John 14:18.) When Christ by
the Holy Spirit comes to dwell in the heart of a person who exer-
cises faith, that person then has indwelling righteousness. Christ is
the person's righteousness within. The born-again Christian, upon
whose heart the Holy Spirit has been bestowed, has the power to
do works that in God's sight are righteous (1 John 2:29). This per-
son is righteous as Christ is righteous (1 John 3:7) only because
Christ, who is perfectly righteous, is dwelling in his or her heart by
the Holy Spirit.

                                                                   59

CHRIST OUR SHEPHERD (1 Peter 2:25).
  What imagery does Peter use to emphasize our total depend-
ence upon Christ? 1 Peter 2:25.

   As sheep that go astray are entirely helpless, so are sinners who
do not have Christ as their Shepherd and Bishop. They cannot ex-
tricate themselves from the pit of sin that is holding them. They
are victims of the urges, impulses, and impressions that Satan,
working through their fallen humanity, constantly thrusts upon
them.
   The Lord mourns because of the waywardness of His professed
people. (See Jer. 50:6; compare Eze. 34:6.)
   Jesus cared for the multitudes who came to Him. So today He
cares for the masses of unsaved humanity. "But when he saw the
multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they
fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd"
(Matt. 9:36).
   As our Shepherd and Bishop, what does Jesus do for us? Luke
15:3-7; John 10:1-16.

   When we are lost, Jesus comes after us. However stormy the
circumstances of our lives or complicating and binding the tenta-
cles of sin, Jesus seeks us with infinite compassion. When we re-
spond to His seeking, He places us upon His strong spiritual
shoulders and carries us to the warmth and safety of the sheep-
fold.
   Then He tenderly ministers to our wounds and leads us to
peaceful grazing grounds and springs of living water. "He will
feed his flock like a shepherd, he will gather the lambs in his arms,
he will carry them in his bosom, and gently lead those that are
with young" (Isa. 40:11, RSV). What a Saviour!
   Jesus is also our Bishop. The Greek word used in 1 Peter 2:25
means overseer, superintendent, guardian. Four times in the New
Testament the word bishop is used to refer to the human ministers
whom Jesus has appointed to care for His people. (See Acts 20:28;
Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 3:2; Titus 1:7.) But the Master Bishop, who vigi-
lantly oversees the affairs of His church, is Jesus Himself.
  Would you describe for your Sabbath School class how Shep-
herd Jesus delivered you from the power of sin?

FURTHER STUDY: Consider the following passages that refer to
Christ as our sin-bearer: Isa. 53:5, 12; Gal. 3:13; Heb. 2:9; 9:28;
1 Peter 3:18; 1 John 3:5. Read "A Divine Sin Bearer" and "Justified
by Faith," Selected Messages, book 1, pp. 308-310, 389-398.
   Christ bore our punishment. "Through disobedience Adam fell.
The law of God had been broken. The divine government had
been dishonored, and justice demanded that the penalty of trans-
gression be paid.
   "To save the race from eternal death, the Son of God volun-
teered to bear the punishment of disobedience. Only by the humili-
ation of the Prince of heaven could the dishonor be removed,
justice be satisfied, and man be restored to that which he had for-
feited by disobedience. There was no other way."—Selected Mes-
sages, book 1, p. 308.
   Living faith accepts Christ's control. "When the soul lays hold
upon Christ as the only hope of salvation, then genuine faith is
manifested. This faith leads its possessor to place all the affections
of the soul upon Christ; his understanding is under the control of
the Holy Spirit, and his character is molded after the divine like-
ness. His faith is not a dead faith, but a faith that works by love,
and leads him to behold the beauty of Christ, and to become as-
similated to the divine character."—Selected Messages, book 1,
pp. 391, 392.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. On the basis of this week's lesson, how would you explain
     the relationship between the message of total victory over sin
     through Christ and the message of Christ's sealing of His
     last-day people?
   2. How can a person who is reviled remain silent or react only
      with love?
   3. Do you think it is possible for a person to be saved who does
      not believe that Jesus paid the penalty for our sins on the
      cross? What reason would you give?
SUMMARY: We are to follow in Christ's steps by being willing to
suffer patiently as He did and by constantly depending upon Him
for victory over sin. The basis of our salvation, His sacrifice on the
cross, makes it possible for Him to bestow righteousness upon us
by the Holy Spirit.

                                                                    61

          To Love, Honor, and
               Cherish




READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Peter 3:1-7.
     MEMORY TEXT: "Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them
     according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto
     the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of
     life; that your prayers be not hindered" (1 Peter 3:7).
   KEY THOUGHT. In the home, the relationship between hus-
band and wife is to be one of understanding and tact. Because they
are joint heirs of God's grace, respect and love are to motivate both
husband and wife in all their interactions.
   "TENDER TIES THAT BIND. The family tie is the closest, the
most tender and sacred, of any on earth. It was designed to be a
blessing to mankind. And it is a blessing wherever the marriage
covenant is entered into intelligently, in the fear of God, and with
due consideration for its responsibilities.
   "Every home should be a place of love, a place where the
angels of God abide, working with softening, subduing influence
upon the hearts of parents and children."—The Adventist Home,
pp. 18, 19.
   There are few things that impact more upon the spiritual life of
the Christian than the marital relationship. It can be a means of
strengthening love and faith in God, or it can prove to be a heavy
cross, crushing and destroying spiritual vitality. For this reason
pointed counsel is given by the apostles Paul and Peter to both
single and married persons. This week we will study counsel from
the apostle Peter that has relevance for the entire family.

THE ATTITUDE OF WIVES TO HUSBANDS (1 Peter 3:1).
   What attitude should wives adopt toward their husbands?
1 Peter 3:1.

   Willing cooperation is not blind subservience. Keep in mind
(1) the value God places upon a human life, (2) His gift of freedom to
the human will, and (3) the context of 1 Peter 3:1-7.
   First, let us eliminate what Peter did not mean:
   1. Because Peter qualifies a submissive spirit with the words
"your own husbands," he is not addressing the subject of the sta-
tus of women in society. He is not saying that women must be
subordinate to men.
   2. He is not suggesting sexual, social, intellectual, emotional, or
spiritual inferiority.
   3. He is not suggesting that the wife is to submit herself to the
sexual whims of a demanding husband. (See 1 Peter 3:7.) Nor is he
saying that the wife is to submit herself to emotional or physical
abuse.
   The wife takes her place at the side of her husband, to support,
encourage, and respect his role. The point of 1 Peter 3:1-7 is that a
loving wife may succeed in winning an unbelieving husband, not
by preaching, but by faithful fulfillment of her responsibilities as a
wife.
  What counsel did the apostle Paul give on the same subject?
Col. 3:18; Eph. 5:22-25.

   "The Bible plainly states that the husband is the head of the
family. 'Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands.' [Col.
3:181 . . . but we will read the conclusion of the same injunction,
which is, 'As it is fit in the Lord.'
    "God requires that the wife shall keep the fear and glory of God
ever before her. Entire submission is to be made only to the Lord
Jesus Christ, who has purchased her as His own child by the infi-
nite price of His life. God has given her a conscience, which she
cannot violate with impunity. Her individuality cannot be merged
into that of her husband, for she is the purchase of Christ. It is a
mistake to imagine that with blind devotion she is to do exactly as
her husband says in all things, when she knows that in so doing,
injury would be worked for her body and her spirit."—The Advent-
ist Home, pp. 115, 116.

WIVES OF UNBELIEVING HUSBANDS (1 Peter 3:1, 2).
   What purpose does Peter give for wives' being in submission
to their own husbands? 1 Peter 3:1.

   Peter was referring specifically to the situation in which the wife is
a believer and the husband an unbeliever. (Compare 1 Cor. 7:10-16.)
   As Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire, converts
came from either Jewish or pagan households. Some households
were divided over religion. This division caused similar kinds of
problem to those that arise today.
   Simon Kistemaker points out: "In the middle of the first century, a
wife was expected to profess the religion of her husband. If the hus-
band adopted the Christian faith, his spouse would have to do so,
too. But if the wife became a Christian, her husband would consider
her unfaithful to him and his pagan religion. This caused tension in
the home."—"Exposition of the Epistles of Peter and of the Epistle of
Jude," in New Testament Commentary (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker
Book House, 1987), p. 118.
  Identify in the Scriptures some men and women who led their
households to become Christians.
     Acts 10:1, 2, 44-48
     Acts 16:14, 15
     Acts 16:29-34
     1 Cor. 1:11, 16
   "Let your husband see the Holy Spirit working in you. Be care-
ful and considerate, patient and forbearing. Do not urge the truth
upon him. Do your duty as a wife should, and then see if his heart
is not touched. Your affections must not be weaned from your hus-
band. Please him in every way possible. Let not your religious
faith draw you apart. Conscientiously obey God, and please your
husband wherever you can."—The Adventist Home, p. 349. (Com-
pare 1 Cor. 7:12-15.)
   Can you think of persons, whether married or single, whose
resistance to truth was overcome by understanding, patience, and
love? In what ways can the church support a person who is seek-
ing to win an unbelieving spouse?

ADORNMENT FOR CHRISTIANS (1 Peter 3:3, 4).
    What type of adornment will be most effective in catching the
attention of your partner and impressing him or her with the
d-.1,.1;4,7 of Its a Chrictian life? 1 Peter 1-1 4

   God wants the character of each believer, whether married or sin-
gle, "to be conformed to the image of his Son" (Rom. 8:29). The per-
son who receives Christ is now a partaker of the divine nature
(2 Peter 1:4). The Holy Spirit brings the Christian progressively
nearer to the image of Christ (2 Cor. 3:18). This new person, who re-
flects the warmth of Christ's love and the purity of His character,
wishes always to think, speak, and act like his Lord. Because Christ is
living out His life through the individual (Gal. 2:20), the pattern of
dress and conduct will be such that Christ respects.
   The believers' dress should be respectable, modest, showing
good judgment and self-control, revealing reverence for God.
   What two principles enable us to define jewelry so that we
can refrain from wearing it and displeasing our Lord? 1 Tim. 2:9,
10; Gal. 2:10 (compare Prov. 21:13).

   1. The adornment factor. Christians are not to dress to attract
attention to themselves. Neatness and beauty of appearance do not
require adornment. Jewelry is intended to adorn and attract to one-
self. It tends to encourage sinful pride. Hence, it conflicts with the
"meek and quiet spirit," the beauty of character valued by Christ.
Even the wearing of inexpensive jewelry contradicts the principle
the apostles were teaching.
   2. The expense factor. Jewelry is often expensive. How can a
Christian spend money for unnecessary outward adornment while
others live in abject poverty?
    Converted taste. "The lesson applies to believers in every age.
'By their fruits ye shall know them.' Matthew 7:20. The inward
adorning of a meek and quiet spirit is priceless. In the life of the
true Christian the outward adorning is always in harmony with
the inward peace and holiness. . . . Evidence that the taste is con-
verted will be seen in the dress of all who walk in the path cast up
for the ransomed of the Lord."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 523.
   Does your manner of dress always conform to Bible princi-
ples?

EXAMPLES OF HOLY WOMEN (1 Peter 3:5, 6).
   The holy women of old adorned themselves with an appropri-
ate spirit and thus became examples to be followed. Each occupied
her place beside her husband, recognizing him as head of the
home.
  List some of the "holy women" whom Peter may have had in
mind as examples for later generations.
     Gen. 17:15-21
     Gen. 24:45, 46, 58, 59
     Gen. 29:18
     Ex. 2:1-10
     Ruth 1:1-4
  What relationship with God identified the holy women spo-
ken of in 1 Peter 3:5?

   The lives of these godly women were not always above re-
proach. Nevertheless, they consistently served the Lord.
   Peter used the Greek word translated "hoped" (RSV), "trusted"
(KJV). These holy women of old kept alive the Messianic hope.
Each one hoped that she would be the mother of the Deliverer.
Her faith was centered in the Messiah to come, as ours is centered
in the Christ who has come.
   Why did Peter single out Sarah as a special example for Chris-
tian women? 1 Peter 3:6; Heb. 11:11, 12.

  As Abraham is recognized by Paul as the father of those who
have faith in God (Gal. 3:29), so Sarah is recognized by Peter as the
mother of Christian women who are rich in good works and who
have courageous hearts. Yet, Sarah did not always agree with
Abraham. On at least one occasion, the Lord took Sarah's part
against Abraham's will. (See Gen. 21:9-12.)
  Why is it very wise for a husband to consider carefully the
counsel of a Christian wife?

HUSBANDS AND THEIR WIVES (1 Peter 3:7).
  What attitudes are husbands advised to adopt toward their
wives? 1 Peter 3:7.

   "Live together according to knowledge" is the literal meaning
of what Peter wrote. This knowledge encompasses the whole range
of marital experience. It means understanding and tact in dealing
with each issue, one by one, as it arises in the relationship between
husband and wife.
  What did Peter mean by referring to the wife as the "weaker
vessel"? 1 Peter 3:7.

   The wife is to receive physical, emotional, and spiritual support
from her husband. She may or may not be weaker in any of these
areas; she may be stronger. The Lord designed marriage to involve
a partnership in which the weaknesses of one partner are supple-
mented by the strengths of the other.
   The counsel to husbands contained in 1 Peter 3:7 suggests that
the entire passage applies equally to them. It is more likely that a
wife can be lovingly submissive when her husband is loving and
considerate. To love a wife "as Christ loved the church and gave
himself up for her" (Eph. 5:25, RSV) is a great responsibility. More-
over, a wife is more likely to be modest and frugal in her manner
of dress when her husband refrains from spending large amounts
on flashy clothes and expensive "toys" for himself. She will relish
her role as a wife if her husband considers her physical, emotional,
and spiritual needs.
  What principle of salvation lies behind Peter's advice to hus-
bands in 1 Peter 3:7? Gal. 3:28, 29.

   In respect to salvation, God makes no distinction between male
and female. We are all joint heirs of God's grace and fellow heirs
with Jesus Christ. This fact, in itself, should provide husbands with
the motivation to have great respect for their wives. This principle
should lead every church member to give great respect to every
other member of the congregation.
   How does God treat the prayers of the husband who fails to
love and honor his wife? 1 Peter 3:7 (compare Eph. 5:25-33).

                                                                   67
                                                        August 28
FURTHER STUDY: Compare Paul's counsel in the following
verses with Peter's counsel in this lesson: 1 Cor. 7:1-39; 11:1-16;
1 Tim. 2:8-12; 5:9; Eph. 5:21-33; Col. 3:18, 19; Titus 2:3-5.
   Authority to be exercised with humility and love. "It is no evi-
dence of manliness in the husband for him to dwell constantly
upon his position as head of the family. It does not increase respect
for him to hear him quoting Scripture to sustain his claims to
authority. It will not make him more manly to require his wife, the
mother of his children, to act upon his plans as if they were infalli-
ble. The Lord has constituted the husband the head of the wife to
be her protector; he is the house-band of the family, binding the
members together, even as Christ is the head of the church and the
Saviour of the mystical body. Let every husband who claims to
love God carefully study the requirements of God in his posi-
tion."—The Adventist Home, p. 215.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. A young Christian woman is married to a man who thinks of
     her as inferior to himself, and who demands obedience to his
     wishes. She has smiled in public, but suffered deeply in pri-
     vate. Now she can bear no more and tells you of her pain.
     How will you minister to her? What if the husband refuses to
     acknowledge his need of help? What responsibility does the
     church have to guide this family to the help they need?
  2. A husband is convinced his wife has been influenced by the
     feminist movement. She does not like housework. He thinks
     that because she has her own career and seems to take no
     interest in his, she wants to live her life independently of
     him. What counsel could you offer him?
  3. Your teenage daughter loves jewelry and makeup. She insists
     on wearing earrings and necklaces, and paints her fingernails
     red. How would you relate to her? What needs may lie be-
     neath her strong feelings on this issue? How might parents
     and the church winsomely lead her toward New Testament
     principles?
SUMMARY: Both the husband and the wife share equally the re-
sponsibility of making the marriage a success. The principles of
kindness, empathy, and love that govern their relationship are the
basis of happiness in all human relationships and of harmony
within the church.

                           I

READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Peter 3:8-22.
  MEMORY TEXT: "Be ready always to give an answer to every
  man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with
  meekness and fear" (1 Peter 3:15).
KEY THOUGHT. Christians are called to bear witness to their
faith in all kinds of circumstances—friendly and hostile. Do not
hesitate to let people know what inspires you with peace and joy
in the present and with confidence in the future.

   THE LAW OF SPIRITUAL CAUSE AND EFFECT. The street
preacher harangued the noontime crowds as they hurried to res-
taurants. No one had time to stop and listen, because the noon
lunch period was short. Periodically he interrupted his preaching
with personal questions and comments addressed to passersby:
"Sir, did you know that the wages of sin is death?" "Madam, if
you give your heart to Jesus, you will find peace." A manicured
gentleman dressed in a tweed suit commented as he hurried by,
"Your technique is terrible, but your reasoning from cause to effect
is flawless."
    Jesus was the great proclaimer of spiritual cause and effect. For
example, He said, "Judge not, that ye be not judged" (Matt. 7:1);
"For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased" (Luke 14:11).
    Peter also deals with cause and effect. "Do not return evil for
evil . . . that you may obtain a blessing" (1 Peter 3:9, RSV). "But
even if you do suffer for righteousness' sake, you will be blessed"
(verse 14, RSV).

                                                                  69

BLESS AND
      AND BE BLESSED (1 Peter 3:8-12).
   Can you identify the one great principle that summarizes the
five Christian characteristics listed in verse 8?

   "Those who profess to be followers of Christ and are at the
same time rough, unkind, and uncourteous in words and deport-
ment have not learned of Jesus. A blustering, overbearing, fault-
finding man is not a Christian. . . . Their sincerity may not be
doubted; their uprightness may not be questioned, but sincerity
and uprightness will not atone for a lack of kindness and cour-
tesy."—The Adventist Home, p. 427.
     How is the Christian to respond to abuse? 1 Peter 3:9.

   Peter does not call Christians merely to patient endurance under
abuse, but to an active response—rendering good for evil. He adds
that rendering blessing for abuse is part of the Christian's calling.
And there are rewards. The blessings of the eternal covenant be-
tween God and His people are for those who render good for evil.
   "Even under false accusation those who are in the right can af-
ford to be calm and considerate. God is acquainted with all that is
misunderstood and misinterpreted by men, and we can safely
leave our case in His hands. He will . . . surely vindicate the cause
of those who put their trust in Him. . . . Those who are actuated by
the spirit of Christ will possess that charity which suffers long and
is kind."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 520.
  List the ingredients Peter puts into his prescription for a
happy and productive life. 1 Peter 3:10-12.

   These verses can be considered a brief summary of Jesus' Ser-
mon on the Mount. (See Matt. 5:33-48.) Peter had heard Jesus'
counsel in regard to pure speech and love for enemies. He had
learned from hard experience that Jesus was right. Happiness is
not measured in terms of the special treatment others give us, but
in terms of the peace of Christ that reigns in our hearts.

  Apply 1 Peter 3:8-12 to your own life. Is this your habitual
way of life? If not, how do you think it can become so?

DEFEND THE FAITH (1 Peter 3:13-17).
  What will be the state of those who suffer for righteousness'
sake? 1 Peter 3:13, 14.

   The Christian sufferer will be secure and blessed. Peter's point is
that the innocent sufferer enjoys the special favor of God. Outward
suffering, whether physical, economic, or even emotional, need not
destroy our peace of mind or the vitality of our fellowship with
Christ.
  What should God's people be prepared to do? 1 Peter 3:15.

   We "sanctify [reverence] the Lord God" in our hearts by giving
Christ a place there that no one else is permitted to occupy. With
kindness, gentleness, and respect, we are to explain to others why
Christ has our first loyalty.
   Peter's instruction on preparedness is set in the context of suf-
fering abuse and persecution (verses 13-17). The defense of the
Christian faith that Peter has in mind is before hostile ques-
tioners. As Peter penned these words, Christians were being
brought before pagan judges and magistrates because of their
religious faith. They were to be prepared to defend the gospel of
Jesus by giving a forceful, but reverent, presentation of the rea-
sons for their faith.
  According to Jesus, how are we qualified to give a defense of
our faith? Matt. 10:19, 20?

   The preparation for an adequate defense of our faith is done
day by day. Time spent with God's Word fixes its truths in the
memory. Then when we are called upon to defend the hope that
makes us what we are as a church, the Holy Spirit brings to mind
what has been stored in the memory. But if preparation is not
made today, tomorrow the memory will be blank when truth seeks
a defender.
  The Revised Standard Version translates 1 Peter 3:16: "And
keep your conscience clear, so that, when you are abused, those
who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame."
Can you testify to the truth of that statement? What personal ex-
periences have you had that illustrate it?
                                                                    71

THE HEART OF THE GOSPEL (1 Peter 3:18).
 "For Christ also died for sins once for all" (1 Peter 3:18, RSV).
What is the significance of this statement?

   The heart of the gospel message is the fact that Christ died for
our sins and rose again to be our living Saviour. Paul regarded this
message "of first importance." (1 Cor. 15:3, RSV).
   We have seen that Peter emphasized this truth earlier in his
Epistle (1 Peter 2:24). Christ's innocent suffering is the best illustra-
tion of Peter's point that, where necessary, suffering for what is
true and right is pleasing to God. (Compare 1 Peter 2:20 with 3:17.)
   Christ died "once for all" (1 Peter 3:18, RSV). This truth is reit-
erated elsewhere in the New Testament. (See Heb. 7:27; 9:28; 10:10.)
The once-for-all sacrifice of Christ rules out the idea that the cel-
ebration of communion involves a repetition of Christ's atoning
sacrifice. Communion reminds us that the one sacrifice of Christ
was sufficient for all sinners, for all time.
   The sacrifice was by "the righteous for the unrighteous, that
he might bring us to God" (1 Peter 3:18, RSV). What does this
tell us about the major reason for Calvary?

    Peter is saying in effect, "The righteous Christ died so that He
could make us righteous." He says this in 1 Peter 2:24: "that we,
being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness." Even though
Christ's one sacrifice on the cross was perfect and complete as a
payment for the penalty of sin, His work for sinners did not stop
there. Calvary made it possible for Christ to forgive our sins, and
His resurrection enables Him to transform our lives, provided we
are willing. Transformation of lives before the cross was in view of
the sacrifice to be made; transformation after the cross is in view of
the sacrifice that has been made.
    How does Jesus make repentant, confessing sinners righteous?
It is by grace, through faith (Eph. 2:8). His grace awakens faith in
our hearts; then Christ, by the presence of the Holy Spirit, bestows
righteousness upon us (Rom. 8:9, 10).
  How was Jesus raised to life? 1 Peter 3:18 (compare Rom. 10:9;
John 10:17, 18). List the blessings that the resurrection of Christ
brings to you.

JESUS AND THE SPIRITS IN PRISON (1 Peter 3:19, 20).
   An understanding of the state of the dead affects one's interpre-
tation of 1 Peter 3:19, 20. If there is a conscious state following
death, then Jesus could preach to the imprisoned spirits of those
who rejected the otter of God's grace through the preaching of
Noah. Those who hold this view appeal to 1 Peter 4:6 to support
their position: "For this cause was the gospel preached also to
them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in
the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit." But, since Scrip-
ture does not support consciousness in death, we must look for
another meaning to the words of Peter.
   What do the following passages teach about death? Matt. 9:18,
24; John 11:11 (compare 1 Cor. 15:6, 18-20, 51; 1 Thess. 4:13;
2 Peter 3:4).

   Without doubt, the Bible teaches that death is an unconscious
state illustrated by sleep. Who then are the spirits in prison (1 Peter
3:19, 20)? They are not people who have died, for the dead are
unconscious (asleep) and unable to hear the gospel's invitation.
   The explanation. Adam Clarke offers the correct understand-
ing of this passage when he says that the spirits in prison are
"the inhabitants of the antediluvian world, who, having been dis-
obedient, and convicted of the most flagrant transgressions
against God, were sentenced by his just law to destruction. But
their punishment was delayed to see if they would repent; and
the long-suffering of God waited one hundred and twenty years,
which were granted to them for this purpose; during which time,
as criminals tried and convicted, they are represented as being 'in
prison'—detained under the arrest of divine justice, which waited
either for their repentance or the expiration of the respite, that
the judgment pronounced might be inflicted."—The New Testa-
ment of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ (New York: Abingdon,
n.d.), vol. 6, p. 861.
   How did Jesus preach to these people? "That the Spirit of God
did strive with, convict, and reprove the antediluvian, is evident
from Gen. vi 3         And it was by this Spirit that Noah became a
 preacher of righteousness and condemned the ungodly world."—
Clarke, p. 861.
  Compare Noah's day with ours. Are unbelievers "in prison"
today? What does God do for them?
                                                                    73

THE MEANING OF BAPTISM (1 Peter 3:21, 22).
  How do you understand Peter's statement that baptism saves
us? 1 Peter 3:21.

   The Revised Standard Version translates the text: "Baptism,
which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt
from the body but as an appeal to God for a clear conscience,
through the resurrection of Jesus Christ." The Bible does not teach
that there is saving virtue in the rite of baptism. Baptism symbolizes
death to sin and resurrection to new life by the new-birth experi-
ence. Only the death and resurrection of Jesus make this experi-
ence possible. Peter makes it clear in 1 Peter 3:20 that eight souls
were saved by being in the ark. They were saved by God. The
water was the means God used to separate them from the evil
world that was perishing in the deluge. Hence, the statement
"eight souls were saved by water" is metaphoric. The water sym-
bolized the salvation provided by God.
  How are we saved? Eph. 2:8. What is the relationship of water
baptism to salvation? Rom. 6:1-7.

   The statement, "Baptism . . . now saves you" (1 Peter 3:21, RSV),
is a metaphor. The waters of baptism symbolize the means by
which believers are separated from this present evil world that is
soon to perish. Peter's point (in 1 Peter 3:20-22) is that, just as the
waters of the Flood symbolized God's saving mercy in separating
Noah and his family from the evils of their world, so baptism sym-
bolizes God's saving grace for those who accept Christ today.
   People are not saved by being washed in water, but by having
their consciences purified by divine power (1 Peter 3:21, 22).
   What are the special advantages to us that Christ "is gone into
heaven, and is on the right hand of God" (1 Peter 3:22)? Heb.
9:11-15 (compare Heb. 7:24, 25; Heb. 8:1, 2;1 Tim. 2:5).

   There could be no forgiveness of sin without the high priestly
mediatorial ministry of Jesus Christ. "We have an advocate with
the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous" (1 John 2:1). Because Christ
is now our "high priest of good things to come" (Heb. 9:11), He is
able to purge our consciences from sin and enable us to serve God
(verse 14).

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Because death, like sleep, is a state of unconsciousness, how
     would you explain Paul's meaning in Philippians 1:21-23?
      2. In the light of the preceding explanation of 1 Peter 3:19, 20,
         how would you explain 1 Peter 4:6?
      3. Because Christ gives us His righteousness now by the Holy
         Spirit (Rom. 8:9, 10), why should we be concerned about
         growing in holiness? (See 2 Peter 3:18.)
      4. Peter's counsel about patient endurance in times of persecu-
         tion seems to refer to suffering inflicted by those who are not
         believers in Christ. Suppose you are unjustly treated by a fel-
         low church member. How would you relate to that? Does the
         Bible speak to this issue?
SUMMARY: There is a spiritual law of cause and effect. Peter ap-
peals to this law when he tells us to render good for evil. As God's
remnant, we inherit the covenant blessings when by faith we fol-
low Peter's counsel. Because Jesus died and rose again, He is able
to function as our High Priest. His purifying work in our hearts
separates us from sin and prepares us to share eternity with Him.

           Victory and Service




Sailutit„Afterttoon,
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Peter 4:1-11.
     MEMORY TEXT: "Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for
     us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind:
     for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin"
     (1 Peter 4:1).
   KEY THOUGHT. The suffering and death of Christ enable the
Christian to gain victory over sin. The liberated Christian no longer
lives as a slave to sinful passion, but according to God's will.
    THE BEST-LAID PLANS. An American sailor reminisced about
the warm tropical evenings spent with his fellow seamen on the deck
of a ship in the South Pacific during World War H. Each evening the
conversation would turn to the fear that lurked in the mind of each
man—the possibility of being torpedoed. Each sailor knew that at
any given moment the alarm could be sounded, followed by a deaf-
ening explosion. Each sailor detailed for the others what he would do
if the ship were torpedoed. Then one night the alarm sounded, fol-
lowed by the explosion. Recalling the mass confusion, the sailor said
that not one did what he had said he would do.
    There is a reverse parallel to this experience for Christians. God
has issued instructions that will enable His people to move in uni-
son through the explosive events that will end the history of this
world. Those who heed these instructions will find in God a refuge
in the time of need. Some of these instructions are dealt with by
Peter in this week's lesson.

DEATH TO SIN (1 Peter 4:1).
  For whom did Christ suffer in the flesh? 1 Peter 4:1.

   inis statement is a continuation 01 lite litUU6itl i met piebcittcu
in 3:18. In that verse he speaks of Jesus' suffering and death. There-
fore, when Peter speaks of Jesus' suffering in 4:1, he is directing
our attention to Jesus' death. In view of His death for sinners, His
followers are to arm themselves with a similar frame of mind—a
willingness to die. As Jesus "suffered in the flesh" (died), so we
must be willing to suffer in the flesh (die).
   Two kinds of death. Obviously the person who has died physi-
cally has "ceased from sin" (1 Peter 4:1). But the next verse (1 Peter
4:2) indicates that Peter is speaking of a person who goes on living
as having died to sin. He lives "for the rest of the time in the flesh
no longer by human passions but by the will of God" (1 Peter 4:2,
RSV). Jesus died for sin; the believer dies to sin.
   What type of death on the part of the sinner will place him in
a position where he will not continue to live a sinful life? Rom.
6:1-7.

   Paul and Peter are of one mind. When Peter says, "For he that
hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin," he is conveying the
same truth that Paul teaches when he says, "Or don't you know that
all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his
death?        For we know that our old self was crucified with him so
that the body of sin might be rendered powerless, that we should no
longer be slaves to sin—because anyone who has died has been freed
from sin" (Rom. 6:3-7, NIV). "For you died, and your life is now hid-
den with Christ in God" (Col. 3:3, NW).
   "The old sinful life is dead; the new life entered into with Christ
by the pledge of baptism. Practice the virtues of the Saviour's charac-
ter. . . . The sins that were practiced before conversion, are to be put
off, with the old man. With the new man, Christ Jesus, are to be put
on 'kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering.' "—
Sons and Daughters of God, p. 300. The fallen nature still remains after
the death of the "old man," which is the life we used to live before we
found Christ. (See Eph. 4:22-24, 1 Cor. 9:27.)
   Can you honestly say that the "old man," your old life of ha-
bitual sinning, is dead? How do you know?

                                                                     77

ALIVE TO GOD (1 Peter 4:2, 3).
   According to Peter, what change will take place in the life of
the sinner who has suffered and died with his Lord? 1 Peter
4:2, 3.

   Again Peter and Paul are in agreement. Compare Paul's state-
ment in Romans 6:13. The apostles wished their readers to under-
stand that when they accept Jesus there follows a turning away
from the old lifestyle.
   What is God's will for us in our battle against sin? Romans
6:12, 14; Phil. 2:12, 13.

   The root of the sin problem is our fallen human nature. This
nature is shared by all Adam's children. We are born with it. At
any stage in our experience, insofar as we fail to appropriate the
power of Christ, we are "carnal, sold under sin" (Rom. 7:14). Even
after Paul's conversion the daily battle with the propensities of his
fallen self continued. (See 1 Cor. 9:27; Gal. 5:16, 17.) This legacy
from Adam is always present, urging us on to do and say things
that we know are wrong.
  So that sin should not reign in our mortal bodies, our fallen
nature must be continually subdued and controlled. But how?
John 15:7; Rom. 8:2.

   "The warfare against self is the greatest battle that was ever
fought. The yielding of self, surrendering all to the will of God,
requires a struggle; but the soul must submit to God before it can
be renewed in holiness."
   "What you need to understand is the true force of the will. This
is the governing power in the nature of man, the power of deci-
sion, or of choice. Everything depends on the right action of the
will. . . . You can give Him your will; He will then work in you to
will and to do according to His good pleasure. Thus your whole
nature will be brought under the control of the Spirit of Christ;
your affections will be centered upon Him, your thoughts will be
in harmony with Him."—Steps to Christ, pp. 43, 47.
  What practical steps do you go through when you are
tempted? Are they effective? Why?

THE END IS AT HAND (1 Peter 4:4-7).
   What is Peter's teaching about a coming judgment? Who is
brought to judgment in the instance that Peter is speaking of?
1 Peter 4:4, 5.

   Followers of Christ are often ridiculed by those who are living
for the here and now. Those who reject the opportunity of salva-
tion will be subject to judgment and retribution at the coming of
Jesus. (See 2 Tim. 4:1.)
  Who are the dead to whom the gospel is preached? 1 Peter 4:6.

   The verse does not refer to the preaching of the gospel to dead
people. The Greek verb is past tense: "The gospel was preached
even to the dead" (1 Peter 4:6, RSV). It was preached to them while
they were still living. The purpose of the preaching was that, though
they would remain subject to death like the rest of humanity, they
would have the privilege of living spiritually because of fellowship
with God.
   To what climax of history does Peter direct our attention?
What is the basis of his call for earnest prayer? 1 Peter 4:7; Acts
2:16, 17.

   Peter spoke of the second advent of our Lord as being near. He
could point to several evidences to support his faith. For example,
the Messiah had come, the Holy Spirit had been given, the gospel
was being preached throughout the known world, and scoffers
were ridiculing the idea of coming judgment. Peter spoke with as-
surance about the nearness of the end. He tells us to get the things
of this life in their proper perspective.
  Make a list of fulfilled prophecies from Daniel, Revelation,
Jesus' sermons, and any other inspired sources that give
evidence of the soon return of Jesus—prophecies that could not
be used by Peter because they had not been fulfilled in his
day.
   What is to be the lifestyle of those who are expecting the soon
return of Jesus? 1 Peter 4:7; 2 Peter 3:11-14.


                                                                   79

UNFAILING LOVE (1 Peter 4:8, 9).
  Describe the relationship that early Christians had with one
another. 1 Peter 4:8, 9.

   Love for the brethren. The word that is translated "charity"
(KJV) means "love." Love permeated the experience of the apos-
tolic church and helped to make Christianity attractive to Jews
and Gentiles alike. Because God wished this experience to con-
tinue, He moved decisively against the greed and deception of
Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5:1-11). If their greed had not been
checked in a decisive way, it could have stifled true love among
the believers.
   A prerequisite for the "latter rain." This love is essential for
believers who wish to receive the final outpouring of the Holy
Spirit in the "latter rain." "Before the final visitation of God's judg-
ments upon the earth there will be among the people of the Lord
such a revival of primitive godliness as has not been witnessed
since apostolic times. The Spirit and power of God will be poured
out upon His children."—The Great Controversy, p. 464.
     In what way does love cover a multitude of sins? 1 Peter 4:8.

   Love does not excuse sin, but where love reigns, people are will-
ing to forgive and forget the sins of others. When the disciples of
Jesus came to love one another, they received the great outpouring
of the Holy Spirit.
  Why would Peter instruct his readers to provide hospitality
ungrudgingly? 1 Peter 4:9.

  The early Christian church had many poor members. Initially
wealthy believers shared material things with those who had
need. (See Acts 2:44, 45.) Evidently, as time went by, this practice
was not continued in the same spirit of spontaneous generosity.
Peter wanted to see his midcentury brethren and sisters enjoying
the same joyous fellowship that had blessed the first believers.
Preachers needed support as they devoted themselves to the
ministry.
  Does a true spirit of love reign in your local church? If not,
what can you do to improve the situation?

STEWARDS OF GOD'S GRACE (1 Peter 4:10, 11).
   By what means are we enabled to function as good stewards
of God's grace? 1 Peter 4:10.

   Love in action for others is a key element in stewardship. This
involves working for them in various ways, lifting their burdens,
and, where possible and appropriate, assisting them materially.
   What two kinds of ministry does Peter indicate should be
given in the church so that God can be glorified? 1 Peter 4:11.

   Ministry of the Word by elders and practical ministry by dea-
cons were instituted by God in the apostolic church. (See Acts 6:1-
7.) But the work of these appointed ministers was supplemented
by the witnessing and welfare ministry of the laity.
   God's instruction to His last-day church. "I have been in-
structed to refer our people to the fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah.
Read this chapter carefully and understand the kind of ministry
that will bring life into the churches. The work of the gospel is to
be carried by means of our liberality as well as by our labors.
When you meet suffering souls who need help, give it to them.
When you find those who are hungry, feed them. In doing this
you will be working in lines of Christ's ministry. The Master's holy
work was a benevolent work. Let our people everywhere be en-
couraged to have a part in it. . . .
   "The fast which God can accept is described. It is to deal thy
bread to the hungry and to bring the poor which are cast out to
thy house. Wait not for them to come to you. The labor rests not
on them to hunt you up and entreat of you a home for them-
selves. You are to search for them and bring them to your house.
You are to draw out your soul after them. You are with one
hand to reach up and by faith take hold of the mighty arm
which brings salvation, while with the other hand of love you
reach the oppressed and relieve them. It is impossible for you to
fasten upon the arm of God with one hand while the other is
employed in ministering to your own pleasure."—Welfare Minis-
try, pp. 29-31.
  Does your local church have a program of ministering to the
poor and homeless in your community? What is your personal
contribution to welfare ministry?

                                                                 81
                                                    September 11
FURTHER STUDY: Note how we are to put away the "works of
the flesh." Study Galatians 5:16-24. Read the chapter "Repentance"
in Steps to Christ, pp. 23-36. Also read "Isaiah 58—A Divine
Prescription" in Welfare Ministry, pp. 29-34.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. From our study of 1 Peter 4:1-11, there seems to be a definite
     relationship between the spiritual state of believers and their
     capacity to render service for others. How would you explain
     that relationship?
     2. A single mother in your church is struggling to support her
        family. She would like to send her children to church school.
        What can you do to help her?
     3. Young people in your community have an earnest desire to
        attend an Adventist college. They do not have the needed
        money, despite their hard work. Can you help? Will you
        help?
     4. What is your church doing to help aged members of the flock
        who cannot afford to live in a nursing home? Do you have a
        program for helping them? Are those who cannot attend
        church visited regularly?
     5. Obviously the church cannot solve everyone's financial prob-
        lems. What can be done by your church to help people im-
        prove their health and happiness? What about cooking
        classes, weight-loss programs, marriage-enrichment pro-
        grams, health seminars? What more do you think local
        churches can do than they are doing now in community
        service?
SUMMARY: As we come to Christ, we die to sin, are buried in
baptism, and rise with Him in newness of life. The "old man" of
sin, the old lifestyle, is left behind. Our fallen human natures are
brought under the control of the Spirit of Christ, provided we are
willing to surrender our wills to Him. As we near the end of this
world's history, we are to depend upon Christ to live His life in us,
and to prepare to render an account for our stewardship of His
grace.

           Suffering and the
               Christian



&Nu&Aftentoon,
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Peter 4:12-19.
  MEMORY TEXT: "Beloved, think it not strange concerning
  the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange
  thing happened unto you" (1 Peter 4:12).
  KEY THOUGHT. Suffering can be understood correctly only as
we grasp the significance of the great controversy between good
and evil and its implications for Christians.
   WHY SUFFERING? An emaciated figure of a man sat under a
tree in a grove at Uruvela, India. He had been living on a single
fruit per day. His limbs looked like the knotted joints of withered
creepers, his spinal cord like twists in a rope, and his eyes, sunken
into their sockets, looked like deep pools of water. When he placed
his hand upon his stomach, he could almost feel his backbone.
Thus Gautama—the Buddha—described himself as he sought en-
lightenment by self-mortification. He was wrestling with one of the
greatest problems that philosophers and religious thinkers have
ever faced—human suffering and its cause. (Based on John B.
Noss, Man's Religions, third ed. [New York: MacMillan Company,
1956], pp. 172, 173.)
   The Word of God has drawn the veil aside so that this problem
can be understood. Ellen White's Conflict of the Ages series pre-
sents the cosmic struggle of the ages—the great controversy be-
tween Christ and Satan. As a result, Seventh-day Adventist
Christians can better understand the whys and wherefores of suf-
fering and death.
                                                                  83

FIERY TRIALS (1 Peter 4:12).
   What experiences in the life of a Christian are not to be
looked upon as if they were something strange? 1 Peter 4:12.

   This is the third time the apostle Peter deals with the problem of
suffering. In his first treatment of the subject (1 Peter 2:18-25), he
deals with the abuse servants and slaves sometimes suffer at the
hands of their masters. Jesus, the patient Sufferer, is held up as the
great model to be followed. In the second treatment (1 Peter 3:13-
17), Peter explains how one who suffers for righteousness' sake is
blessed. In this week's lesson, Peter assures his readers that if they
suffer together with Jesus, they will also be glorified together with
Him.
   Who is behind all of the hardship and trials that the Christian
faces in life? 1 Peter 5:8.

   As a prowling lion, Satan stalks every sinner who accepts Jesus.
Through trial and suffering, he attempts to bring discouragement
and doubt upon Jesus' followers as a means of separating them from
their Lord. If they patiently maintain their trust in Jesus, the instru-
ments designed to destroy them will be turned into a blessing.
   "Trial is part of the education given in the school of Christ, to
purify God's children from the dross of earthliness. It is because
God is leading His children that trying experiences come to them.
Trials and obstacles are His chosen methods of discipline, and His
appointed conditions of success."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 524.
   "The fact that we are called upon to endure trial proves that
the Lord Jesus sees in us something very precious, which He
desires to develop. If He saw in us nothing whereby He might
glorify His name He would not spend time in refining us. We do
not take special pains in pruning brambles. Christ does not cast
worthless stones into His furnace. It is valuable ore that He tests.
   "The blacksmith puts the iron and steel into the fire that he may
know what manner of metal they are. The Lord allows His chosen
ones to be placed in the furnace of affliction in order that He may
see what temper they are of and whether He can mold and fashion
them for His work."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 214.
     In what ways have the trials of your life proved a blessing?

SUFFERING FOR CHRIST'S SAKE (1 Peter 4:13, 14).
  Why should Christians not think it strange that fiery trials
come upon them? John 15:18, 19.

   The servant is not above his Lord. Those who choose to be fol-
lowers of Jesus may expect to be treated as He was treated. This
fact can be understood only in the light of the great controversy.
Jesus and His followers are seen by Satan as an offense.
   "The world loves sin, and hates righteousness, and this was
the cause of its hostility to Jesus. All who refuse His infinite love
will find Christianity a disturbing element. The light of Christ
sweeps away the darkness that covers their sins, and the need of
reform is made manifest. While those who yield to the influence of
the Holy Spirit begin war with themselves, those who cling to sin
war against the truth and its representatives.
   "Thus strife is created, and Christ's followers are accused as
troublers of the people. But it is fellowship with God that brings
them the world's enmity. They are bearing the reproach of
Christ."—The Desire of Ages, p. 306.
   Peter was writing to Gentile converts who had never been per-
secuted for their religious beliefs. Peter points them to the bright
side of the whole experience.
  Why are Christians to rejoice in suffering? 1 Peter 4:13, 14;
Acts 5:41; Rom. 8:17.

   Christians may rejoice when they suffer for Christ's sake, not
because they appreciate suffering, but because they know that con-
flict with Satan and sin always involves opposition. Believers in
Christ have aligned themselves with His plan to win lost souls.
Therefore they are the object of Satan's attacks. Their joy and peace
result from awareness of the righteousness of Christ's cause.
   "In this life we must meet fiery trials and make costly sacri-
fices, but the peace of Christ is the reward. There has been so little
self-denial, so little suffering for Christ's sake, that the cross is al-
most entirely forgotten. We must be partakers with Christ of His
sufferings if we would sit down in triumph with Him on His
throne."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 215.
   Can you tell of specific occasions when focus on Christ's suf-
fering gave you courage for your daily struggle?
                                                                      85

SIN INVITES SUFFERING (1 Peter 4:15, 16).
  Why were the apostles calm and confident when confronted
by threats and beatings by the Sanhedrin? Acts 5:40-42.

   The apostles were consciously innocent and wholly committed
to Christ's cause. They did not permit persecution to dampen their
evangelistic zeal. In the face of beatings and the threat of death,
they preached and worked more fervently than before. Do we
have the courage to do what they did?
   "So long as we choose the easy path of self-indulgence and are
frightened at self-denial, our faith will never become firm, and we
cannot know the peace of Jesus nor the joy that comes through
conscious victory. The most exalted of the redeemed host that
stand before the throne of God and the Lamb, clad in white, know
the conflict of overcoming, for they have come up through great
tribulation. Those who have yielded to circumstances rather than
engage in this conflict will not know how to stand in that day
when anguish will be upon every soul, when, though Noah, Job,
and Daniel were in the land, they could save neither son nor
daughter, for everyone must deliver his soul by his own righteous-
ness."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 215.
   Four truths stand out. As we think through what Peter says, the
following four points stand out: (1) The followers of Jesus will not
escape persecution and trials. (2) Trials and suffering will test the
spirituality of every Christian. (3) By our suffering for Christ and
what He represents, we share in His suffering. (4) We will share
Christ's glory if we endure to the end.
   Although we are not to be ashamed when we suffer as Chris-
tians, what causes of suffering are we strenuously to avoid?
1 Peter 4:15.

   The word rendered "busybody in other men's matters" (KJV)
and "mischief-maker" (RSV) appears nowhere else in all ancient
Greek literature. Literally the word implies "looking into that
which belongs to another." Peter is advising Christians to stay out
of other people's personal affairs.
   When you have suffered because of your own sins or mis-
takes, what gave you courage to carry on?

JUDGMENT OF PROFESSED BELIEVERS (1 Peter 4:17).
   Because Peter believed that Christ's death and resurrection in-
troduced the last era of human history (1 Peter 1:20; 4:7), he was
   f • .31 _   L LL — L LL —                    rm.; Telel   Thrill 1 tlrll Arll 1 ft.
                                        —

the Christian era God has determined who belong to Christ and
who do not. This fact does not rule out the reality of the heavenly
investigative judgment in the last days. Repenting Israelites were
judged forgiven throughout the year (Lev. 4:26, 31, 35). But not
until the Day of Atonement did the final judgment of the year
occur, which involved cleansing of both sanctuary and people. (See
Lev. 16:29-34; compare Dan. 7:9-14; 8:14.)
  Where does the judgment begin? 1 Peter 4:17; Eze. 9:4-11.

   In Ezekiel 9:5, 6, those who were sealed were judged worthy of
life. Those who were slain at the sanctuary were in a state of incur-
able rebellion. (See Rev. 7:1-3.) In the pre-advent, investigative
judgment, God's people are acquitted (Dan. 12:1; compare Rev.
3:5). Those who have rejected Christ's mercy are judged later.
    Ellen White sets 1 Peter 4:17 in the context of the pre-advent,
investigative judgment: "In the typical service only those who had
come before God with confession and repentance, and whose sins,
through the blood of the sin offering, were transferred to the sanc-
tuary, had a part in the service of the Day of Atonement. So in the
great day of final atonement and investigative judgment the only
cases considered are those of the professed people of God. The
 judgment of the wicked is a distinct and separate work, and takes
place at a later period. 'Judgment must begin at the house of God:
and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey
not the gospel?' 1 Peter 4:177—The Great Controversy, p. 480.
  What is our role in determining the outcome for us of the pre-
advent, investigative judgment? Rev. 3:5; 19:7, 8.

   The robe of Christ's righteousness is given to the believer by the
Holy Spirit in the new-birth experience. (See Heb. 8:9, 10; 1 John
2:29; 3:7.) This is Christ's transforming gift of grace to the one who
has faith. (See Eph. 2:8-10.) The overcomer retains this gift by
maintaining daily fellowship with Jesus, and he is acquitted in the
pre-advent judgment by the decision of the heavenly court to re-
tain his name eternally in the book of life.
                                                                                  87

JUDGMENT OF THE LOST (1 Peter 4:17-19).
  At what point in the history of the great controversy are the
records of the wicked examined? When is the verdict pro-
nounced? Rev. 20:4, 11-15 (compare Matt. 25:41-46).

   Those who have never had their names placed in the book of
life, because they have never accepted Christ, and those who have
their names removed, because they do not retain their robe of
righteousness (Dan. 12:1; Rev. 3:5) are judged during the millen-
nium while they are in their graves. (See Rev. 19:19-21; 20:1-4.) At
the end of the millennium the wicked are raised from the dead
(Rev. 20:5) to receive their sentence of eternal death (Rev. 20:11-15).
    "The whole wicked world stand arraigned at the bar of God on
the charge of high treason against the government of heaven. They
have none to plead their cause; they are without excuse; and the
sentence of eternal death is pronounced against them."—The Great
Controversy, p. 668.
   In view of the judgment, to whom does Peter admonish his
readers to commit their souls? 1 Peter 4:19.

   Committing oneself to God involves active well-doing. "The
Greek verb translated 'should commit' [1 Peter 4:19, NIV] is infor-
mative. In classical literature it was used of turning over money to
a friend for safekeeping. There were no banks in ancient times, so
a person leaving home for an extended period would want to
place his coins in the custody of someone he could trust. To break
such a trust was a serious offense. Sufferers may place their lives
in God's hands with full assurance that he will guard the deposit
with the greatest of care. The same verb is used of Jesus on the
cross when he called out in a loud voice, 'Father, into your hands I
commit my spirit' (Luke 23:46). . . .
   "Committing oneself to God is not passive submission. It in-
volves active well-doing. While believers will certainly endure the
hostility of an unbelieving world, there is no place for a martyr-
dom mentality. Suffer in silence but get on with the job of living an
active life of good deeds."—Robert H. Mounce, A Living Hope
(Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1982), pp. 78, 79.

FURTHER STUDY: On the subject of the pre-advent judgment,
compare: Dan. 7:9-14; 8:9-14; 12:1; Rev. 3:5; 6:9-11. Read the chapter
"Facing Life's Record" in The Great Controversy, pp. 479-91.
DISC! TSSICIN CH TF.STIONS:
  1. Distinguish between the trials and suffering that you have
     brought upon yourself because of poor judgment and the tri-
     als you suffer because you are a living witness to the Lord
     Jesus Christ.
  2. What inconvenience are you willing to suffer for the name of
     Jesus?
  3. How do you view the judgment? Do you look upon it as an
     event to be feared or as a vindication of your faith and trust
     in Jesus? What does this week's lesson suggest should be our
     attitude to the judgment?
SUMMARY: Because human beings have become the focal point
of the great controversy between Christ and Satan, the person who
accepts Christ is destined to suffer Satan's wrath. God uses the af-
flictions experienced in this controversy to mold our characters,
while He sets limits on the extent to which Satan can harass His
people. In the judgment, God acquits those who have put their
faith in Him. Those who have refused His mercy are condemned.

Sakkatiu,Afternoon,
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Peter 5:1-14.
     MEMORY TEXT: "Humble yourselves therefore under the
     mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time: cast-
     ing all your care upon him; for he careth for you" (1 Peter 5:6,
     7).
    KEY THOUGHT. The years of Christian warfare had taught
Peter to cast all his cares upon Jesus. In the words of our memory
text, Peter expresses optimism and confidence. He invites each of
us to share his experience of humbling himself before God, casting
all our cares upon Jesus.
   A WORD TO UNDERSHEPHERDS. The apostle Peter shows a
deep concern that the leaders of God's flock shepherd His people
for proper motives. How easy it is for people with selfish motives
to fleece the sheep and make themselves fat while those over
whom they watch sacrifice for the work of God! Capturing the
spirit of Peter's words, Adam Clarke, in his commentary on 1 Peter
5:3, reproves the leaders of churches who selfishly lord it over their
flocks. He warns of God's wrath toward shepherds who dare to
enrich themselves at the expense of God's people. Then he ad-
monishes the pastor: "Preacher or minister, whosoever thou art,
who readest this, apply not the word to thy neighbour, whether he
be state-appointed, congregation-appointed, or self-appointed; take
all to thyself. . . . See that thy own heart, views, and conduct be
right with God."—Adam Clarke, The New Testament of Our Lord
and Saviour Jesus Christ, p. 868.

RESPONSIBILITY OF ELDERS (1 Peter 5:1).
    "Feed my sheep." As Peter prepared to bring his Epistle to a
close, he remembered the commission of the Good Shepherd,
iir               (1,-,hr, 91 .1A) HP naccpd nn the charge of the
Good Shepherd to those who are called by God to be under-
shepherds.
  How did Peter look upon the relationship between himself
and other "elders" within the early church? 1 Peter 5:1.

   The Greek word for "elder" (presbuteros) identifies a person who
has advanced through the years of life and with the accumulated
wisdom that this experience brings is worthy of honor and respect.
The term also is used for persons who hold positions of trust, and
who deserve respect by virtue of their position. In 1 Peter 5:1, Peter
is addressing church leadership. (Compare Titus 1:5.)
   Although Peter's position as a leader among the original 12 apos-
tles of Jesus would bring to him great honor and respect, he refers to
himself as a "fellow elder" (RSV). He did not speak of himself as
being above those who carried the responsibilities of leadership.
  Besides being a fellow elder, what else does Peter tell his
readers about himself? 1 Peter 5:1.

   Peter saw some of the physical abuse that Jesus endured at the
hands of His enemies. How could he ever forget that battered
and bruised face smeared with blood as Jesus turned to look him
in the eye when he had said, "I know not the man" (Matt.
26:74)! After his conversion, Peter testified from Jerusalem to
Rome of the suffering Jesus had borne so that repentant sinners
could go free.
   Peter was one of three privileged disciples who not only looked
forward to the time when they will share the glory of their return-
ing Lord, but who had already enjoyed a foretaste of this experi-
ence. Peter, James, and John witnessed the transfiguration of Jesus,
and were allowed to share, even if but for a moment, in the glory
that will attend Him as He comes to gather His waiting people
from all generations of time. (See Matt. 17:1-8.)
   Are ministers the only ones called to feed God's flock? What
responsibilities do members of the church have for one another?

                                                                    91

THE CALL TO SPIRITUAL LEADERSHIP (1 Peter 5:2-4).
   What is Peter's first charge to all future undershepherds?
1 Peter 5:2. What do you understand this charge to mean?

  The word here rendered "feed" also means "to tend." Peter
commissions the undershepherds to tend the flock of God, which,
of course, includes the responsibility to see that the flock is
properly fed. However, the responsibilities go beyond feeding.
  List the remaining charges given by Peter to future under-
shepherds. 1 Peter 5:2, 3.

   The word translated "filthy lucre" (KJV) or "shameful gain"
(RSV) in verse 2 depicts a "mean" person who has selfish motives
for service.
   "Think of the difference in the effectiveness of our ministry if
we are ministering with eagerness, initiative, and enthusiasm as
opposed to doing it simply because we have to or because we
are seeking personal gain or recognition. It is the difference be-
tween a boy carrying out the garbage because his mother or-
dered him to do it and that same boy playing baseball because
he wants to do it.
   "We need to serve the flock of God not for monetary gain, but
eagerly!"—Paul A. Cedar, The Communicator's Commentary: James,
1, 2 Peter, Jude (Waco, Texas: Word Books, 1984), p. 191.
   Peter also warns undershepherds not to lord it over God's heri-
tage.
   "Let no one suppose that God has given to men the power of
ruling their fellow-men. He will accept the service of no man who
hurts and discourages Christ's heritage."—Ellen G. White Com-
ments, Seventh-day Adventist Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1149.
   What will the faithful undershepherd receive from the Chief
Shepherd? 1 Peter 5:4 (compare 1 Cor. 9:25; 2 Tim. 4:7, 8; Rev.
4:10).

   Apart from the desire for money, what other motives do you
see as selfish? What help is available to those who need and
long for higher motives? How can what seems to be drudgery
ever become interesting and exciting?

BE HUMBLE, BE VIGILANT (1 Peter 5:5-8).
   Why is the younger generation urged to be submissive?
1 Peter 5:5.

    The word elder refers to church leadership in verse 1. In verse 5
it is used for older persons.
   Who else, besides the younger generation, is to be submis-
sive? How are the followers of Jesus to be clothed? Why? 1 Peter
5:5-7.

   Prescription for a happy church. Peter speaks quite often about
a submissive attitude. For example, we are to submit to the ordi-
nances of man (1 Peter 2:13) if they do not contradict the com-
mands of God. Servants are to obey their masters (1 Peter 2:18).
Wives are to be subject to their own husbands (1 Peter 3:1-5). An-
gels, authorities, and powers are subject to Jesus (1 Peter 3:22). The
younger generation are to submit to their elders (1 Peter 5:5). And
all are to be subject to one another. If all followed Peter's counsel,
we would have a peaceful, happy church.
   Clothed with humility. The word here rendered "clothed"
depicts an outer garment that is secured with a knot—for example,
an apron. Jesus put on such a garment when He humbled Himself
and washed the disciples' feet. The Greek may also refer to a
"stole-like garment that was the sign of honor and pre-eminence."
The apron of humility becomes a garment of honor for Christ's
servants. Paul A. Cedar observes, "Many would be scantily clad if
clothed in their humility."—The Communicator's Commentary: James,
1, 2 Peter, Jude, p. 194.
   Why is the Christian to be vigilant? 1 Peter 5:8 (compare Rev.
12:12, 17).

   "Satan assailed Christ with his fiercest and most subtle temp-
tations, but he was repulsed in every conflict. Those battles were
fought in our behalf; those victories make it possible for us to
conquer. Christ will give strength to all who seek it. No man
without his own consent can be overcome by Satan. The tempter
has no power to control the will or to force the soul to sin. He
may distress, but he cannot contaminate."—The Great Controversy,
p. 510.
                                                                   93

ESTABLISHED IN THE FAITH (1 Peter 5:9-11).
  How can the devil be defeated by the Christian? 1 Peter 5:9;
James 4:7; Rev. 12:11.

   Satan is beaten when we submit to Christ and resist temptation.
We are to be "steadfast in the faith." Peter is speaking not only of
faith in Christ but of being established in the faith, the teaching of
Scripture. He is emphasizing the importance of sound doctrine.
The presence of the definite article, the, makes the abstract noun,
faith, concrete. The acceptance of solid Christian doctrine can form
a shield against the attacks of the "roaring lion."
   What is one good motive Peter gives for being steadfast in the
faith? 1 Peter 5:9.

   The inward battle against sin is common to all followers of
Christ. Outward opposition to our faith, in one form or another,
is always present. To withdraw from the struggle in discourage-
ment is to fail Jesus and our fellow believers in other parts of the
world.
   What does God undertake to do for those who have suffered
for His cause? 1 Peter 5:10.

   "Peter now sets forth a fourfold promise. God will restore you
and make you strong, firm and steadfast. . . . The first term (restore) is
used in several contexts. In Mark 4:21 it is used of mending nets.
In 1 Corinthians 1:10 it describes the joining together of members
of a church in view of pending disunity. . . . It means to repair so
as to place back into service. Suffering may take its toll, but God
will restore. He will repair the 'damage' and fit us for continued
service.
   "The second term means to establish and make solid. The third
means to fill with strength, and the fourth to establish on a firm
foundation. The net effect of these four positive verbs is that God
intends to restore and establish securely those who are now suffer-
ing on his behalf."—Robert H. Mounce, A Living Hope (Grand
Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1982), p. 89.
  Are you willing to describe for other Sabbath School members
how the Lord restored you after a period of trial?

SALUTATION (1 Peter 5:12-14).
  Who penned this Epistle for the apostle Peter? 1 Peter 5:12.

                                   Arinn lArrni-P nut fnr him what he

wished to communicate to the believers in Christ. Peter, no doubt,
himself wrote the closing words of salutation, thus following a pat-
tern that Paul used in writing his Epistles. It is generally agreed by
commentators that the Silvanus of verse 12 is the Silas that we read
about in the book of Acts and in Paul's epistles.
   The wording of the phrase, "By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto
you, as I suppose," in the KJV tends to leave the reader wondering
whether Peter had a question about Silas's loyalty. The RSV re-
moves any doubt: "By Silvanus, a faithful brother as I regard
him."
  What does the Bible tell us about Silas?
  Acts 15:22
   Acts 15:32
   Acts 15:37-40
   Acts 16:19, 25, 29, 37
   Acts 17:13, 14
   2 Cor. 1:19
   We consider 1 Peter as the work of the apostle Peter and as an
inspired book even though it was penned by someone else. Com-
pare the work of writing assistants in the production of biblical
books with the preparation of Ellen White's writings.
   Where was 1 Peter written? 1 Peter 5:13.

   A message from Babylon. Babylon is a cryptic name for the city
of Rome. There is no existing evidence that Peter ever visited Bab-
ylon, although there was a large Jewish community in the Mesopo-
tamian valley at the time 1 Peter was written. However, we do
know that Peter was in Rome. In fact, according to historical tradi-
tion, he was crucified upside down just outside the city.

with the optimism that we have seen repeatedly throughout his
letter by testifying, "This is the true grace of God wherein ye
stand" (1 Peter 5:12). Select three statements made by Peter that
have strengthened your faith and optimism about your future and
the future of God's people.

SUMMARY: God has entrusted to men and women the sacred re-
sponsibility of helping to guide God's people through the experi-
ences of life, the closing events of the great controversy, and into
His everlasting kingdom. Peter admonishes these undershepherds
and every member of Christ's church to be true to their calling and
tender with the flock.
