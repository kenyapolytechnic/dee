              Introduction to the
               Song of Solomon
            A Song of Love
    The Song of Solomon provides a special contribution to the
overall body. of Scripture. Even the casual reader cannot help being
carried aloft on the heights of the poetic eloquence Solomon dis-
played. The deeper meanings of its images and symbols will
challenge the careful Bible student. If the literary quality itself is
striking, its theme is even more so. The Song of Solomon addresses
the fundamental human need for love and intimacy. If we will
permit it to do so, the Song reveals to us heaven's perspective on
human sexuality—God's gift to us at Creation, which serves to
shape and control so much of our action and interaction with one
another.
    Specifically, the Song portrays in the most delicate terms the
attraction, the passion, the tenderness, the unbounded delights of
the relationship between a husband and wife. It discloses the inner-
most thoughts of the hero and heroine, showing their deep feelings
for each other, as well as some of their anxieties, fears, and strug-
gles. In this portrayal, it is without equal in all of Scripture.
    Certainly in these days, when the whole trend of society is to
dishonor marriage and debase the coinage of love, we may be most
grateful for the instruction, insights, and inspiration found in this
part of God's pure Word. To couples, courting and married, the
Song provides guidance, counsel, encouragement, and support
through the experiences shared by Solomon and his Shulamite
queen. Couples struggling in their relationship will find secrets to
a renewal of their romance and covenant with each other. Perhaps
they can be encouraged to study together this quarter, drinking
deeply of those insights and challenges that will bring renewed
meaning to their united lives.
     Yet, the Song is more than a poem about courtship and mar-
riage. This creative work by Israel's King Solomon was made pos-
sible because God gave him the gift of a wise and understanding
heart. Through him the Holy Spirit speaks to all about dimensions
of love in the wider circle of the family, love between parents and
children, between friends, and in relationships of loving service.
    And, because God Himself has chosen human marriage as a
 figure of His relationship with His people, our discoveries of love
 in the Song of Solomon will afford priceless insights to that inti-
 mate bond between the soul and Christ in the grandest marriage of
all.
    Christ is the heavenly husband, whose unbounded love for His
 earthly bride has moved Him to sacrifice all for her future happi-
 ness. Solomon's Song may be viewed as a symbolic representation
 of Christ's intimate fellowship with His believing people.

    Solomon: The Shaping
       of a Bible Writer




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Sam. 12:24, 25; 1 Kings
2:1-9; 3:3-13; 4:29-33; 8:22-30; 11:1-8.

    MEMORY TEXT: "A blameless life makes for security;
    crooked ways bring a man down" (Proverbs 10:9, NEB).

  KEY THOUGHT: The life, times, and special gifts granted to
Solomon prepared him to write his renowned Song.

   GOD INSPIRED SOLOMON. A casual reading of the biogra-
phy of Solomon might lead some readers to question whether he
was one of those "holy men of God [who] spake as they were
moved by the Holy Ghost" (2 Peter 1:21). Solomon is known for
the magnificent temple he built and furnished, and for his
writings—the Song of Solomon (sometimes called Canticles or
the Song of Songs) as well as Ecclesiastes and Proverbs. Yet a
shadow falls across his memory because of his polygamous,
self-indulgent lifestyle, the opulence of his court, his oppressive
taxation of his nation, his idolatry, and failure to be true to his
covenant with God. Can we put our trust in the writings of such
a man? Can we really consider his writings inspired?
   There were periods of Solomon's life in which he was thor-
oughly right with God. The Bible account reveals that, at those
times, God gave him exceptional wisdom and insight into the
attitudes and behaviors of the human heart.

SOLOMON'S FAMILY BACKGROUND
  Note Solomon's family background:
  • 2 Sam. 11:26, 27. His parents' marriage.
  • 2 Sam. 12:1-14; Ps. 51. Judgment of God on his father's sin,
    and God's forgiveness.
  • 2 Sam. 12:15-23. Death of his older brother.
  • 2 Sam. 12:24, 25. Solomon's birth.
   Tragedies and triumphs. Solomon grew up in a household
that knew both the tragedies of sin and the triumphs of God's
grace. King David's dual sins of adultery with Bathsheba and
the murder of her husband Uriah the Hittite precipitated a se-
ries of crises within the royal family. God loved Solomon (Heb.
"peaceable"), the second child born to the couple. His other
name—Jedidiah—means "Beloved of the Lord."
   However, God's forgiveness of David's sins did not prevent
the adversity that came in the wake of his immorality. Scripture
details with shocking candor the conflicts, sibling rivalries, and
even crimes within the family in which Solomon grew up.
   As a youth, however, Solomon also witnessed his father's
deep love for the cause of God, particularly his preparations for
the building of the temple in Jerusalem. "Great had been
David's fall, but deep was his repentance, ardent was his love,
and strong his faith. He had been forgiven much, and therefore
he loved much."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 754.
   What convictions did David pass on to his son Solomon at
the close of his life? Compare his private conversation with
Solomon in 1 Kings 2:1-9 with his public charge in 1 Chron.
28:9, 10, 20, 21; 29:1-5.

   A father's wishes. Solomon was commissioned by God to
build the temple. David's final words to his son reflected his
beliefs about spiritual life and commitment to God. (See
1 Kings 2:3.)
   Like many parents, David expected his son to complete cer-
tain unpleasant tasks David had not finished. Unfortunately
these included acts of retribution upon persons who had caused
the father personal injury.
  What experiences have helped shape your attitudes and be-
havior today? How do the expectations of others influence or
govern your plans and actions?
                                                                 7

A SPECIAL GIFT FOR THE NEW KING
    What subjects interested Solomon? 1 Kings 4:33.

    The new king's interests included writing, literature, and the
study of physical and behavioral sciences. He was also gifted in
his understanding of human emotions and feelings. These abil-
ities influenced the content of his writings.
   To what does Scripture attribute Solomon's great learning,
wisdom, and mastery of sciences? 1 Kings 3:4-14, 28; 4:29;
2 Chron. 9:23.

   Solomon cast himself upon the true Source of discernment and
wisdom. "Solomon was never so rich or so wise or so truly great
as when he confessed, 'I am but a little child: I know not how to
go out or come in.' "—Prophets and Kings, p. 30. His prayer
"pleased the Lord" (1 Kings 3:10). God can bless such an attitude
of dependence, of not seeking high position. (See James 1:5.)
   Largeness of heart. God gave Solomon "largeness of heart"
(1 Kings 4:29). The Hebrew word translated "heart" is used
often for the mind and the emotions. "Largeness of heart" sig-
nifies a great emotional capacity. Solomon could share his own
deep feelings and understand those of others.
   How does Solomon's judgment in the case of the two pros-
titutes show his understanding of the workings of the human
heart? 1 Kings 3:16-28.

   Solomon's profound intellect and great heart led his people
and those of the nations around him to comprehend more fully
the ways of Jehovah, His fairness and justice with mankind.
   Compare God's spiritual gifts to Solomon with His prom-
ised gifts to His church today. 1 Kings 4:34; Rom. 12:3-8 (com-
pare 1 Cor. 12:4-12; Eph. 4:7-16). How will the use of these
gifts attract others to Christianity?

   Would those over whom you have parental or supervisory
responsibility think of you as having "largeness of heart"?

THE FRUITFUL YEARS

   "The name of Jehovah was greatly honored during the first
part of Solomon's reign. The wisdom and righteousness re-
vealed by the king bore witness to all nations of the excellency
of the attributes of the God whom he served. For a time Israel
was as the light of the world, showing forth the greatness of
Jehovah."—Prophets and Kings, pp. 32, 33.

   What can we learn about Solomon's early religious experi-
ence from his prayer at the dedication of the temple? 1 Kings
8:22-53.


   Solomon's empire stretched from the River Euphrates in the
north to Gaza in the south (1 Kings 4:24). Through it interna-
tional trade routes wound their way. Israel's geography pro-
vided an opportunity for the wisdom of the great king and the
knowledge of the God he worshiped to spread throughout the
earth.

  What event of personal significance to Solomon occurred
early in his reign? Song of Songs 3:11; 4:7, 8 (compare 6:8, 9,13).


   Solomon's true love. Although his biographer notes espe-
cially his liaisons with foreign governments and marriages to
their women (1 Kings 3:1; 11:1), it would seem that a lovely
woman from his own territory, likely from a northern rural area
of Israel or southern Lebanon, was the true love of his life. Their
romance is the theme of the Song of Solomon.
   Sixty queens and eighty concubines (Song 6:8) were the be-
ginning of a number that would later swell to seven hundred
wives and three hundred concubines (1 Kings 11:3). A concu-
bine in this time was not a mistress, but a woman lawfully
united in marriage to a man—an inferior wife.
   "Solomon lavished praise upon the most loved woman in his
life. Canticles is a dramatic record of his estimation of her. His
protestation of love is a production quite unlike anything else
ever written."—George T. Dickinson, Splendor of the Song of
Solomon, (Washington, D.C.: Review and Herald, 1971), p. 13.

  What good results follow when you lavish honest praise
and affection upon your husband, wife, parents, children, or
some other person close to you?
                                                                  9
Wednesday                                    September 30
SOLOMON'S SIN AND REPENTANCE

  What influences led to the spiritual decline of Solomon
and the decay of his empire? 1 Kings 11:1-4.


   "How often it happens that a person's character is weakest at
the point where he thinks himself strongest. Good traits of char-
acter are in personality somewhat as the grain is in wood. It is
the grain which gives beauty to lovely wood, but if you wish to
split the wood, just hit it along the grain. Similarly, it is along
the grain of his good traits that a man's character is most easily
cracked open. Men may feel so sure of their strong points that
they leave them unguarded. Or they may become proud of
them, and pride makes any good trait bad."—George A.
Buttrick, ed., The Interpreter's Bible (Nashville, Tenn.: Abingdon
Press, 1954), vol. 3, p. 102.
   God did not forsake Solomon. "By messages of reproof
and by severe judgments, He sought to arouse the king to a
realization of the sinfulness of his course. . . . Awakened as
from a dream . . . , Solomon with quickened conscience
began to see his folly in its true light. Chastened in spirit,
with mind and body enfeebled, he turned wearied and thirst-
ing from earth's broken cisterns, to drink once more at the
fountain of life. . . . By the spirit of inspiration the king
recorded for after generations the history of his wasted years
with their lessons of warning."—Prophets and Kings, pp. 77-
79. (See also Education, pp. 153, 154.)

  What counsel, repeated three times by Solomon in his
Song, points to the lesson he had learned of the "need of
guarding the affections and the passions with a firm purpose"
(Prophets and Kings, p. 84)? Song 2:7; 3:5; 8:4.


   The statement in these verses probably means, " 'Don't start
the process of loving exchange until the opportunity and appro-
priate occasion is present.' "—G. Lloyd Carr, The Song of Solo-
mon (Downers Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press, 1984), p. 95.
Solomon sought to give solemn warnings to help youth safe-
guard purity by watchfulness and prayer.

  What can keep the soul from a moral fall such as Solomon's?
How is a spiritual experience with Jesus maintained?

PERFECT TRUTH, IMPERFECT VESSEL

   The Scriptures teach perfect truths through imperfect people.
To cynics and unbelievers the tarnished lives of outstanding
men and women in the Bible provide an ample source of criti-
cism of both God and His followers. Such critics neither know
the Scriptures nor the power of God. "It is one of the best evi-
dences of the authenticity of the Scriptures that the truth is not
glossed over nor the sins of its chief characters suppressed."—
Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 9.

  What benefit can we gain by studying the lives of Solomon
and other Bible characters? Romans 15:4.


   Sin is not excusable; it is to be conquered. "The pen of inspi-
ration, true to its task, tells us of the sins that overcame Noah, Lot,
Moses, Abraham, David, and Solomon, and that even Elijah's
strong spirit sank under temptation during his fearful trial.
Jonah's disobedience and Israel's idolatry are faithfully recorded.
Peter's denial of Christ, the sharp contention of Paul and
Barnabas, the failings and infirmities of the prophets and apos-
tles, are all laid bare by the Holy Ghost, who lifts the veil from the
human heart. There before us lie the lives of the believers, with all
their faults and follies, which are intended as a lesson to all the
generations following them. If they had been without foible they
would have been more than human, and our sinful natures
would despair of ever reaching such a point of excellence. But
seeing where they struggled and fell, where they took heart again
and conquered through the grace of God, we are encouraged, and
led to press over the obstacles that degenerate nature places in
our way."—Testimonies, vol. 4, p. 12.
   God spoke through a purified instrument. Israel's wise yet
imperfect King Solomon was saved by the God who is mighty
to save us. As we study the Song of Solomon this quarter, let us
remember that the human author was a man of passions like
unto us, a sinner saved by grace. The words of his Song are the
divine voice sounding through the fallen instrument. The mes-
sage should not be discredited because of the author's sins.
Deep, yet practical, insights inspired by God are expressed by a
person who knew both good and evil. God, who blessed Solo-
mon with wisdom, imparts it to us through His Word.

   Does the Lord use people despite the sins in their lives, or
after the sins have been removed by His power?
                                                                    11

11. Read The Great Controversy, "Introduction," pp. v-vii;

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Interpersonal or Marriage Enrichment: Think about and
     share the following with your spouse or a close friend:
     a. In the family in which I grew up I was closer to my
        father/mother/other person because . . .

       b. A significant event in my childhood family affecting
          my life was . . .

       c. The way our family thought about God was . . .

     2. What evils resulted from the polygamy practiced by some
        Old Testament characters?

     3. A major point in the lesson is that the manner of life God
        wishes us to follow is the only road to genuine happiness
        and fulfillment. How could Solomon have remained true
        to divinely given ethical and moral principles and, at the
        same time, have related to the political and cultural pres-
        sures of his age?

     4. Should the conventions of society or the demands of a
        particular office ever keep us from strictly obeying God's
        will? Or does God relax His will somewhat because of the
        pressures that confront us? Explain and illustrate your an-
        swer.

SUMMARY: Even though he came from a home in which
there was much rivalry and departure from the path of strict
integrity, Solomon began his reign with every intention of
being guided by God's wisdom. His fall from grace was occa-
sioned by pride, lust, idolatry, and the passion for luxury and
power. Yet there was one maiden whom he loved above all
others as the true wife of his youth. His Song memorializes his
relationship with her.

Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S LESSON: 2 Tim. 3:15, 17; John
17:3; Matt. 22:37-40; Gen. 1:27, 31; Song of Sol. 1:9, 15; 2:2, 10,
13; 5:2, 16.

  MEMORY TEXT: "This is My commandment, that you
  love one another as I have loved you" (John 15:12, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT. The Song of Solomon complements the
practical counsel on human love found elsewhere in the Bible.
   LOVE AS JESUS LOVED. In His final hours before Calvary,
Jesus chose to focus His remarks upon a "new commandment,"
as if to press home to our hearts the one thing that we must not
miss in all our study of Scripture. "Love one another, as I have
loved you" (John 15:12). That commandment treats the essence
of our lives, our relationships.
   People were important to Jesus. He went about teaching, en-
couraging, healing their brokenness, restoring in them the
image of God, fashioning anew their relationships with God
and with one another. (See John 13:35.) The Spirit of Jesus was
active in Old Testament times, as well. The Song of Solomon
takes its place as part of God's great lesson book on relation-
ships. In its melodic verses is echoed the divine refrain, "Love
one another as I have loved you."
                                                                                               13

TRUTH FOR DAILY LIVING

   In the following passages, what assertion is made regard-
ing the source and authority of Scripture? 2 Tim. 3:15-17;
2 Peter 1:21. What purposes do the Scriptures serve?


   Human words express the Word of God. "The Bible is writ-
ten by inspired men, but it is not God's mode of thought and
expression. It is that of humanity. God, as a writer, is not repre-
sented. Men will often say such an expression is not like God.
But God has not put Himself in words, in logic, in rhetoric, on
trial in the Bible. The writers of the Bible were God's penmen,
not His pen. . . . Inspiration acts not on the man's words or his
expressions but on the man himself, who, under the influence
of the Holy Ghost, is imbued with thoughts. But the words
receive the impress of the individual mind. The divine mind is
diffused. The divine mind and will is combined with the
human mind and will; thus the utterances of the man are the
word of God."—Selected Messages, book 1, p. 21.

 What is the central purpose of God's revelation in His
Word? Phil. 3:9-11; John 17:3.


    Truth for all experiences of life. The knowledge of God and
His covenant love for us comes coupled in Scripture with in-
struction for covenant living. "Instruction in righteousness"
(2 Tim. 3:16) could be translated "discipline in right living"
(NEB) or "training . . . in good living" (Phillips).
   "The obedient, believing child of God beholds in it [the
Bible] the glory of a divine power, full of grace and truth.
   "In His word, God has committed to men the knowledge
necessary for salvation. The Holy Scriptures are to be accepted
as an authoritative, infallible revelation of His will. They are the
standard of character, the revealer of doctrines, and the test of
experience."—The Great Controversy, p. v11.

  In the routine affairs of your day-to-day life, are you influ-
enced more by the media, your peers, your culture, or the
Word of God? Consider some practical aspect of your life (for
example, your prayer habits, your financial stewardship, or
your selection of friends).

HOW RELATIONSHIPS REVEAL OUR RELIGION

  To what level of importance does Scripture elevate our
human relationships? Matt. 22:37-40 (compare Lev. 19:18).


   What commandment did Jesus give concerning the attitude
of Christians in all relationships? John 15:12.


   Textbook for life. The Bible is God's textbook on abundant
living, lovingly and carefully designed. In its light we come to
see ourselves clearly, to understand the thoughts and intents of
our hearts. Next to our relationship to God, the Scripture places
highest priority on our relationships with others. The Bible
teaches us how to relate to the individuals around us—with
governments, neighbors, church members, spouses, families,
enemies, the poor, indeed, with everyone.

   Study carefully the following passages. Why are our
attitudes and behavior toward others so important? Matt. 5:22-
24; 25:34-45 (compare 1 John 2:9-11; 3:17, 18).


   "You have done it unto me." Service to God and service to
others are bound together. The Bible knows no distinction be-
tween our spiritual life and the practical duties of our behavior
in relationship to others. It is as much an act of religious service
to God to maintain a human relationship or reestablish a broken
one as it is to bring a gift to the altar. Our attitudes toward each
other comprise the fabric of our spiritual lives as much as do
our acts of worship. One way we show love for God, whom we
cannot see is by loving those around us, whom we can see.
    Imitate Jesus. "Though your efforts for good have been un-
successful ninety-nine times, and you received only insult, re-
proach, and hate, yet if the one-hundredth time proves a
success, and one soul is saved, oh, what a victory is achieved!
One soul wrenched from Satan's grasp, one soul benefited, one
soul encouraged. This will a thousand times repay you for all
your efforts."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 31.

  How does Christ's radically new commandment, "Love one
another as I have loved you," make Christian living different?
How can this kind of love promote healing in situations
where relationships have been strained or broken?
                                                                 15

UNDERSTANDING HUMAN AFFECTION

   Created as social beings, humans have a need for relation-
ships with other people. (See Gen. 2:18.) This longing is for
fellowship, companionship with others, for what social scien-
tists call intimacy. In the deepest sense, intimacy may be defined
as being fully known, fully accepted, and fully loved.

   How does the Genesis account describe the foundations of
human sexuality? What evaluation of God's creative work is
given? Gen. 1:27, 31.


    Since all that God created on the sixth day was pronounced
"very good," we can affirm that our human sexuality, the qual-
ities and attributes that characterize the two sexes, was also, at
that time, "very good."
    After the entrance of sin, human nature was no longer flaw-
less. It is the intention of the gospel to recover the soul and "to
retrace upon it His own image in righteousness and holi-
ness."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 194. Human love in marriage
is still the symbol of God's love for His people.
   How does Scripture mark out the boundaries of sexual be-
havior and attitudes? Ex. 20:14; Lev. 18:6-23; Matt. 5:28; 1 Cor.
6:18.


  We all establish satisfying friendships, but for the man and
woman who wish to share a special love in the deepest levels of
bonding, God's Word demands commitment to the covenant of
marriage. (See Mal. 2:14.) The fullest experience of intimacy is
only for a man and a woman within marriage.
   For human bonding to result in relationships that reflect
the image of God, what transformation is necessary? Eze.
36:26, 27 (compare Ps. 51:10; Rom. 5:5; 12:2; Eph. 3:14-17).


   The indwelling Christ changes hearts and lives. "The di-
vine love emanating from Christ never destroys human love,
but includes it. By it human love is refined and purified, ele-
vated and ennobled. Human love can never bear its precious
fruit until it is united with the divine nature and trained to
grow heavenward."—The Adventist Home, p. 99.

CONTRIBUTION OF THE SONG OF SOLOMON

   In what terms does the woman describe her relationship
with Solomon? Song 5:16. What affectionate name is used by
Solomon for his bride? Song 1:9; 4:7; 5:2; 6:4 (compare 1:15;
2:10, 13; 4:1).


  A manual on friendship. In the Song we see two persons
building a relationship that grows closer and closer. Though
they are married lovers, they are first of all good friends. The
wife declares to her attendants, "This is my friend." "Friend"
here "expresses companionship and friendship without the
overtones of sexual partnership. There is refreshing candour in
her identifying her lover as also her 'friend'—friendship goes
far deeper than mere sexual compatibility and excitement.
Happy is the husband or wife whose spouse is also a friend."—
G. Lloyd Carr, The Song of Solomon (Downers Grove, Ill.: Inter-
Varsity Press, 1984), p. 144.

  How does the Scripture refer to the special bond that is to be
enjoyed by a husband and wife? Gen. 2:24; Matt. 19:4, 5.


   Marriage restored. Jesus died to deliver husbands and wives
from Satan's relentless attacks on them as individuals and on
their special relationship. Yet often within Christian circles
there has been a reluctance to share the good news about this
aspect of life. God delights in the intimate love of each caring
couple. "Like every other one of God's good gifts entrusted to
the keeping of humanity, marriage has been perverted by sin;
but it is the purpose of the gospel to restore its purity and
beauty."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 64.
    The message of the Song "comes to us in this world of sin,
where lust and passion are on every hand, where fierce tempta-
tions assail us and try to turn us aside from the God-given
standard of marriage. And it reminds us, in particularly beauti-
ful fashion, how pure and noble true love is. . . . So long as there
is impurity in the world, we need, and need badly, the Song of
Solomon."—E. J. Young, Introduction to the Old Testament,
pp. 336, 337.

   How do you feel about the open portrayal of loving affec-
tion shown in the Song of Solomon? What does the approach
of the book teach about the God who inspired it?
                                                                 17

REHEARSAL FOR THE GRAND MARRIAGE

   What metaphor is used in both the Old and New Testa-
ments to describe the tender union between God and His peo-
ple? Isa. 54:5; Jer. 3:14; 2 Cor. 11:2.


   Similarities between human and divine love. "God's rela-
tionship with humans is one of intimate bonding and . . . all
human intimacies are 'rehearsals' for the ultimate reunion of
humans with their Creator."—Donald M. Joy, Bonding: Relation-
ships in the Image of God, p. ix.
   Our marriage, the marriages of others we know, and our
close friendships should teach us what it means to relate to
God. The warmth of close relationships ministers the grace of
God to us and provides opportunity for us to minister grace to
others.

  How does the Lord depict the preparation of His people for
His coming? Rev. 19:7-9 (compare Eph. 5:26, 27).


    The "marriage of the Lamb" (Rev. 19:7) is the judgment
(verse 2) that ends with "his servants" being vindicated. (See
The Great Controversy, p. 427.) During this pre-advent judgment
Christ's bride, the "saints" (verse 8), have received His grace to
make them ready for His coming. Clothed with His righteous-
ness, they perform "righteous deeds" (RSV)—works that God
can accept because they are done by faith.
    Only those who maintain their born-again relationship with
Christ are capable of doing works acceptable to God. (See 1 John
2:29). They are described as "righteous, as he is righteous"
(1 John 3:7, RSV). Because Christ dwells in their hearts by the
Holy Spirit, they have righteousness of heart (Rom. 8:9, 10). This
is the "fine linen" spoken of in Revelation 19:8—Christ our right-
eousness, filling our hearts, controlling, and empowering. The
saints who enjoy "the marriage supper of the Lamb" are purified
on this earth, so that, when they meet the heavenly Bridegroom,
they are undefiled, clothed with the perfect marriage garment of
Christ's righteousness.

   Whether you are single or married, do your relationships
reflect an intimate fellowship with Jesus? Is His presence in
your life the source of your ability to interact with others
within and outside your home?

FURTHER STUDY: Consider the relationships portrayed in
Genesis 27. What needs for acceptance and love are demon-
strated? How were these fulfilled or frustrated? Read "The
Plan of Redemption" in Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 63-70;
Mind, Character, and Personality, vol. 1, pp. 218-239.

lowing with your spouse or close friend:
  1. The person who has been most significant in helping me
     understand the Bible is/ was     [individual] because . . .

SUMMARY: The Song of Solomon comes from God and leads
to God. In revealing something of the tenderest ties that
human hearts can know, Scripture elevates our souls toward
God and entwines our hearts more deeply with the Divine.

READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Song 1:1, 5-7; 3:7, 9, 11;
4:1-15.

     MEMORY TEXT: "For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is
     over and gone; the flowers appear on the earth; the time of
     the singing of birds is come" (Song 2:11, 12).

  KEY THOUGHT: Reflection on the Song of Solomon as a
remarkable exhibit of Hebrew literature leads to a deeper ap-
preciation of God's message to us.

   POETRY THE VEHICLE FOR A SPIRITUAL MESSAGE.
Poetry is one of the chief literary forms Bible writers used to con-
vey the profound ideas of sacred truth. With its compression of
ideas, its thought-rhythm, its picturesque imagery, its colorful
figures of speech, biblical poetry has a freshness and vigor that
arouses noble feelings, engages the imagination, and enables the
message to linger in the memory.
   Often this poetry was set to music and sung. As poetry
moves words into a realm apart from prose, so the music pro-
duced by the voice in song takes poetry to a loftier dimension,
creating a new art form that delights the mind and spirit. The
Song of Solomon is in this class. Its very first verse affirms it to
be Solomon's best.

SOLOMON'S BEST SONG
   What is the literary form of this piece and who is its au-
thor? Song 1:1. What other mention is made of the author in
the Song? Song 1:5; 3:7, 9, 11; 8:11, 12.

   Of the 1,005 songs written by Solomon, Israel's wise and gifted
ruler (1 Kings 4:32), this one is acclaimed as the best. References
to plants, animals, palace lore, the mentioning of Solomon by
name, and the theme itself—a royal courtship and marriage—
point to Solomon as the author. Referring to Song 5:10-16, Ellen
White states that Solomon wrote this "by the Spirit of inspira-
tion."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 49.
   "Among the chief subjects of study in the ancient schools of
the prophets, sacred poetry and sacred music held honored
places."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 17.
   Singing helps us draw closer to God and to others. "The
value of song as a means of education should never be lost sight
of. Let there be singing in the home, of songs that are sweet and
pure, and there will be fewer words of censure and more of cheer-
fulness and hope and joy. Let there be singing in the school, and
the pupils will be drawn closer to God, to their teachers, and to
one another."—Education, p. 168.
   With what glorious, triumphant love song does the Bible
close? Rev. 19:5-8. By whom is this song sung? To whom is it
sung?

   "Never can the cost of our redemption be realized until the
redeemed shall stand with the Redeemer before the throne of
God. Then as the glories of the eternal home burst upon our
enraptured senses we shall remember that Jesus left all this for
us, that He not only became an exile from the heavenly courts,
but for us took the risk of failure and eternal loss. Then we shall
cast our crowns at His feet, and raise the song, 'Worthy is the
Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom,
and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing.' "—The Desire
of Ages, p. 131.
  Could a special song help you, a friend, or someone in your
family? What effect does singing have in times of discourage-
ment and temptation? Why is singing so important in wor-
ship? Plan to sing together at family worship today.

THE PRINCIPAL CHARACTERS IN SOLOMON'S SONG

   The Song of Solomon is "the only book in the Bible to have
all its content put into the mouth of speakers."—The Interpreter's
Bible, vol. 5, p. 92.

  Describe the principle characters who speak in the Song of
Solomon.
  1) Song 1:5-7; 3:1-4; 6:13

     2) Song 1:8, 9, 15; 4:1

   The female speaker is called "Shulamite" in Song 6:13. This
may refer to the village of which she was a native. No site by
the name Shulem is known to have existed in the time of Solo-
mon (ca. 950 B.C.), though Shunem, a village about seven miles
east of Megiddo and assigned to the tribe of Issachar (Joshua
19:18), was being called 'Shulem' by the fourth century A.D.
(See SDA Bible Dictionary, p. 1035, "Shulamite.") The Song indi-
cates that Solomon courted the woman in its leading role and
that, because of the several references to Lebanon and its moun-
tains (Song 4:8 ff.), she came from a home to the north.
   Some scholars point out that the word translated
"Shulamite" is the feminine form of the name "Solomon." This
interpretation would agree with the poem's presentation of the
woman as Solomon's opposite and equal. Although the term
appears to be something like a title that might be better ren-
dered "Solomoness" or "Lady Solomon," in our study we will
use the more personal "Shulamith."
   The male speaker, Solomon, refers to her as "my love," "my
bride," "my spouse," "my dove," "my perfect one," but also as
"my sister" (Song 4:9, 10, 12; 5:1), a term of endearment for a
lover that appears in other ancient Near Eastern poetry. The
woman refers to Solomon by name, calls him "the king," but
more often "my beloved."

  What other identifiable group of characters appears in the
poem? Song 1:5; 2:7; 3:11.


   What significance may be attached to the almost non-
existence of personal names in the poem? What is the effect of
terms of endearment and pet names? Do you think the use of
such loving terms will add to the happiness of your home?

THE SPEAKERS AND THE POETIC FORM

   Modern Bible versions commonly divide the script of the
Song of Solomon into the various parts spoken by the major
and minor speakers. Students are usually able to distinguish
between the male and female speakers by a careful observation
of the gender distinctions.

   You may wish to mark your Bible to identify the speakers.
(The NIV has labeled these for you.) Final identification of
the speakers in some instances is difficult, as shown by the
parentheses. Some verses will need to be divided into parts,
as shown by the letters "a," "b," "c," etc.:

  Shulamith: 1:2-4a, 4c, 4f-7, 12-14, 16; 2:1, 3-3:5; 4:16; 5:2-8,
    10-16; 6:2, 3, 11, 12, 13b; 7:9b-8:4, 5b-7, 10-12, 14.
  Solomon: 1:9-11, 15, 17; 2:2; (3:6-10), 11; 4:1-15; 5:1a, (lb);
     6:4-10, 7:1-9; 8:(5a), 13.
  The Daughters of Jerusalem: 1:4b, 4d, 4e, 8; 5:(1b), 9; 6:1.
  Shulamith's brothers: 8:8, 9.
  Friends: (3:6-10); 6:13; (8:5a).

   How does identification of the speakers help in under-
standing the poem?


  Thought rhythm. In common with other Hebrew poetry, the
Song of Solomon achieves rhythm through parallelism, a "bal-
anced symmetry of form and sense," which has been called
"thought-rhythm." (See SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 23.)
One form is a paired arrangement of statements, like a sound
and its echo, called synonymous parallelism.

  The following references contain synonymous parallelism.
Discover the parallel "echo" statements in the remainder of
each of these verses:
  Song 2:8 (NKJV): "Behold, he comes Leaping upon the
                      mountains"

   Song 4:7 (NKJV): "You are all fair, my love"

   Song 7:12 (NKJV): "Let us see if the vine has budded"

  Parallelism provides almost endless poetic variety. Note, for
example, parallelism between verses (Song 1:13, 14).
                                                                23

ILLUSTRATIONS FROM NATURE

  An outstanding characteristic of this poem is its setting
against a backdrop of nature.

  Study the following several verses that mention animals
and plants. What purposes do these serve? What special effect
does reference to them give? Song 2:1, 2, 8, 9; 4:12-15.


   How do animals, plants, and objects of nature assist the
poet in his description of human nature? Compare Christ's
teaching: Matt. 5:13; 6:25, 26; 7:16-20; 13:3-8.

     Lily (Song 2:1, 2)

     Gazelle (Song 2:8, 9)

     Dove (Song 2:14)

     Sun and moon (Song 6:10)

   Lifting one's thoughts toward God. Solomon's vast knowl-
edge of the natural sciences is evident. References to animals,
plants, gardens, orchards, vineyards, spices, perfumes, and pre-
cious stones offer vividness and description with which his au-
dience locally and universally can identify. More than this, the
way nature is presented in the Song of Solomon lifts one's
thoughts toward God.

  How did the psalmist express similar feelings of gratitude
and joy in the Creator's handiwork? Ps. 104:24-26, 33, 34.


   "There are wonderful truths in nature. The earth, the sea, and
the sky are full of truth. They are our teachers. Nature utters her
voice in lessons of heavenly wisdom and eternal truth. But fallen
man will not understand. Sin has obscured his vision, and he can-
not of himself interpret nature without placing it above God. Cor-
rect lessons cannot impress the minds of those who reject the
word of God."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 107.

   What benefit did God intend for nature to provide? What
makes the difference in the way nature speaks to us? What do
the references to nature seem to imply about the poet?

SYMBOLISM OF THE SONG
   Use of metaphors. The Song of Solomon often uses similes
and metaphors, words or phrases suggesting a likeness or anal-
ogy between objects or ideas. (See Song 2:2, 9.) The rich use of
such symbols elevates the literary value of the Song and enables
the author to express discreetly and delicately the intimate rela-
tionship between a husband and wife.

  Parables in miniature. Comparisons in the Song of Solomon
are miniature parables laden with meaning. To decode their
symbolism is to open the door to understanding the message of
the book. Context, emotional association, and other uses in
Scripture help indicate the meaning of the figures of speech.
  Write down what you believe the meaning of the following
metaphors to be. What helped interpret the symbolism?
  a. "My own vineyard I have not kept." Song 1:6, RSV.


   b. "Your name is ointment poured forth." Song 1:3, NKJV.


   c. "Tell me, 0 you whom I love, where you feed your
      flock, where you make it rest at noon." Song 1:7, NKJV.


  What teaching device enabled Jesus to find an avenue to
human hearts? Matt. 13:13, 34.


   Object lessons to convey truth. "Christ had truths to present
which the people were unprepared to accept or even to under-
stand. For this reason also He taught them in parables. By con-
necting His teaching with the scenes of life, experience, or nature,
He secured their attention and impressed their hearts. Afterward,
as they looked upon the objects that illustrated His lessons, they
recalled the words of the divine Teacher. To minds that were
open to the Holy Spirit, the significance of the Saviour's teaching
unfolded more and more."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 21.

   If you had been listening to the parables of Jesus, would
you have welcomed His message or scorned it? What are your
criteria for deciding whether something is truth?

                                                                 25

FURTHER STUDY: Read chapter 1 of Song of Solomon, care-
fully interpreting the symbolic, poetic language. If you have
the SDA Bible Commentary, read "The Poetry of the Bible," vol.
3, pp. 17-28. Read, also "Poetry and Song," Education, pp. 159-
168.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Write one or more ways in which this lesson has given
     you a greater appreciation of Scripture.
     2. Will the information or insight you have gained from your
        study of this lesson bring about any change in the way
        you relate to Scripture? Why?
     3. This lesson has emphasized the importance of song in
        worship. What kind of music do you consider appropriate
        in worship? Why? Is there room for diversity of tastes in
        worship music? How can music affect your daily life with
        Christ?
     4. How does the beauty of nature influence your spiritual
        life? Is the love relationship between the members of your
        family improved by a mutual enjoyment of nature? Why?
        How can you incorporate more of nature in your daily
        life?
     5. Suggest ways in which the wonders of nature may be a
        means of introducing nonbelievers to Jesus Christ.
SUMMARY: How God has favored us in the Song of Solo-
mon! He has given us truths about love and loving in the most
beautiful gift-wrapping known to language. The truth of the
King of kings is presented by an earthly monarch as an artisan
finishes a rare gem and presents it in an exquisite jewel case
befitting its splendor. The poetry in the Song itself speaks of
God's grace and His gracious way of attracting us to truth
vital to our marriages, our homes, and families. The Song of
Solomon reminds us again that when God gives, He gives in
abundance—a good measure, pressed down, shaken together,
and running over.

        God's Gift of Love




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Song 1:4, 6, 7, 12; 2:4; 3:1,
4, 6-8; Gen. 1:27, 31; 2:23-25; Isa. 54:5; 2 Cor. 11:2; Rom. 1:24-32;
Rev. 21:2.

  MEMORY TEXT: "For whatever things were written be-
  fore were written for our learning, that we through the pa-
  tience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope"
  (Rom. 15:4, NKJV).

  KEY THOUGHT: The Song of Solomon is both a literal de-
scription of married love and a symbolic representation of
Christ's union with His believing people.

   HUMAN LOVE ILLUSTRATES GOD'S LOVE. We can
draw many parallels between the love relationship of a man
and a woman and Christ's relationship with His people. Often
a man seeks to win the affection of a woman before she has any
interest in him. Christ died for us before we had any concern for
Him, and He endeavors to attract us to Himself before we have
any desire to be united to Him.
   In courtship, a man and a woman try to understand each
other and look for ways to foster the relationship. They seek to
establish a lasting bond. Just so, the new Christian enters into
fellowship with Christ, tries to understand His ways, and com-
municates with Him directly.
   Marriage symbolizes a permanent union with Christ that
points to an indissoluble bond of love.

                                                                  27

THE STORY BEHIND THE SONG OF SOLOMON

   What story within the poem can you piece together from
the following passages? Song 1:4, 6, 7, 12; 2:4; 3:1, 4, 6-8; 4:8;
8:1, 2, 5.


   Major views held today regarding the Song of Solomon:
   1. Two characters: Solomon and the Shulamite country girl. H. H.
Rowley summarizes it for us: "The king saw her and fell in love
with her, and took her from her country home to make her his
bride in Jerusalem, with the result that he was lifted from a
merely physical attraction to a true and pure love."—The
Servant of the Lord and Other Essays on the Old Testament (Oxford:
Basil Blackwell & Mott, Ltd., 1965), p. 212.
    2. Three characters: Solomon, the Shulamite country girl, and her
shepherd lover. "On this view, the maiden resisted the king's
advances, and though he carried her off to the royal palace, she
was still true to her rustic swain, until the king, failing to win
her affection, allowed her to return to her true love. The book is
thus turned into the story of the triumph of pure love over the
blandishments of a Court."—H. H. Rowley, The Servant of the
Lord and Other Essays on the Old Testament, pp. 213, 214.

  What specific information is recorded about the women to
whom Solomon was married? 1 Kings 3:1; 11:1; 14:21.


   Incomplete narrative. Adherents of the three-character story
reject Solomon as the author. This version casts him in such an
unfavorable light that, had this been the sense of the poem, it is
difficult to see how the rabbis would have allowed it in the
canon of Scripture. The poem reflects the courtship and mar-
riage of Solomon with one of his wives. Scripture mentions
Solomon's wives (1 Kings 11:1; 14:21), but it does not single out
his leading queen.
   The way of poetry. In this poem, crafted in the simple, rustic
style of Eastern poetry, Solomon, perhaps with his special
queen, penned a poetic portrayal of the love between them. It
may be the song of every married couple, as well. It may be-
come the song of all who enjoy close relationships.

  Why is it important to address the "heart," as well as the
"head"? What gives this piece of biblical literature universal
appeal? In what way is its theme modern?

THE PHYSICAL EXPRESSION OF LOVE

   With what words does the Song of Solomon begin? Song
1:2. What do this verse and other verses such as 1:13; 2:6; 7:7-9
indicate about the Song?


   An invitation to a private world. The Song of Solomon is an
invitation to enter the private world of a wedded couple, to sing
their song of love with them. They do not blush to speak openly
of the physical aspects of their love. Such language may seem
too frank, too bold and explicit for some readers today. But the
openness of the Song of Solomon is in keeping with the overall
positive outlook of Scripture on love and sexuality.

   How do the two Creation accounts portray sexuality as
originally a good gift of God? Gen. 1:27, 31; 2:23-25.


   What use do the following scriptures make of married love
as a figure? How do these verses confirm the positive, whole-
some attitude of the prophets toward human sexuality? Isa.
54:5; 62:4, 5; Jer. 2:2; 3:8, 20; Eze. 16:8; Hosea 1-3.


  What evidence is there that "body" and "flesh" are part of
the biblical view of mankind as a wholistic unit?

Gen. 2:7                     Ps. 63:1

Ps. 84:1, 2                  Ps. 139:13-17

1 Thess. 5:23

    "It must . . . be realized that in the Biblical faith, there is
never any split made between the material and spiritual worlds.
. . . In the Biblical view, human beings are always considered as
psychophysical wholes. They cannot be split into separate parts
of soul and body, mind and spirit."—Elizabeth Achtemeier, The
Committed Marriage, p. 157.

   Seventh-day Adventists believe in the totality, the whole-
ness of the person. What is the relationship between the spir-
itual life and the emotional and physical desires of the
Christian?

AN ILLUSTRATION OF DIVINE LOVE

   The love between Solomon and his bride affords an illustra-
tion of the love between God and His people.

  The Bible refers to Israel as the wife of the Lord (Isa. 54:5).
To what does it compare the Christian church? 2 Cor. 11:2;
Eph. 5:25-27; Rev. 21:2.


     Representing a sacred union. The covenant relationship be-
tween God and His people is described in the language of mar-
ried love. But in our fallen state, the experience of marriage for
many has been unfulfilling, disappointing, even bitter. Others
have no experience in marriage. We might expect, therefore,
that our all-wise God would give His people an inside look at
the bonds of affection in a good marriage, some outstanding
example of love and faithfulness, which would serve to exem-
plify on a human level the surpassing bond that exists between
Christ and His church. "In both the Old and the New Testa-
ment the marriage relation is employed to represent the tender
and sacred union that exists between Christ and His people, the
redeemed ones whom He has purchased at the cost of Calvary.
. . . In the 'Song of Songs' we hear the bride's voice saying, 'My
beloved is mine, and I am his.' And He who is to her 'the
chiefest among ten thousand,' speaks to His chosen one, 'Thou
art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.' Song of Solomon
2:16; 5:10; 4:7."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 64.

  Note the aspects of Christ's union with His people sym-
bolized in the following passages.
  Song 2:3—Enjoying peace and rest with Christ (Testimonies,
     vol. 7, p. 69; Education, p. 261).
  Song 2:4—Being covered with Christ's righteousness in the
     celestial banquet hall (Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 206, 207).
  Song 4:7—Christ's estimation of the church by virtue of His
     sacrifice for it (The Ministry of Healing, p. 356).
  Song 4:15—The inexhaustible fountain of grace in God's
     Word (Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 20).
  Song 5:10, 16—The beauty of Christ's character (The Acts of
     the Apostles, p. 275; Education, p. 69; Evangelism, p. 186).
  Song 6:4, 10—The church, clad in Christ's righteousness, ful-
     filling her divine mission (Prophets and Kings, p. 725; Testi-
     monies, vol. 5, pp. 81, 82).
  Song 8:6, 7—Christ's long-suffering love (Education, p. 93).

MORAL PERVERSION AND APOSTASY

   How does the Bible depict the apostasy and unfaithfulness
of God's people? Eze. 23:2-4, 30; Hosea 2:2; Rev. 17.


   The Bible compares the unfaithfulness of God's professed
people to moral impurity. Ancient Israel was His bride, who fell
into spiritual adultery. The Bible represents modern spiritual
Babylon as an adulterous woman with whom the kings of the
earth have committed immorality (Rev. 17:1-6). The reasons for
this imagery are apparent:
   1. God regards His church as His bride. Any defection to the
world on the part of His people is unfaithfulness to the marriage
vow or covenant they have entered into with the Lord.
   2. Whenever men and women turn away from God, they
become instruments of the evil one. Satan and his demons play
upon the inherited tendencies of their minds and bodies, lead-
ing them into immoral thoughts and acts. Note the close associ-
ation between idolatry and immorality in human history.
Unfaithfulness to God has moral and physical results that are
devastating for individuals and society.

   How did Paul demonstrate the close relationship between
spiritual apostasy and sexual immorality? Rom. 1:22-32.


   Paul held all accountable to God because He has given light
to all (Rom. 1:20). Because of unfaithfulness "their senseless
minds were darkened" (Rom. 1:21, RSV). The result was sexual
perversion with inevitable emotional and physical suffering.
"Their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural,
and . . . men committing shameless acts with men and receiving
in their own persons the due penalty for their error" (Rom. 1:26,
27, RSV). Without the restraining power of the Holy Spirit,
human beings become worse than beasts. The God-given sexual
faculties, designed to be used within marriage for the spiritual,
emotional, and physical enrichment of both husband and wife,
become instruments of unholiness and the basest impurity.

   If you are married, how does your relationship with your
spouse rate when compared to Christ's relationship with His
church? Do you delight in your spouse as Solomon delighted
in Shulamith? If you are single, do your relationships with
others emulate Christ's relationships?
                                                              31

THE CULMINATION OF TRUE LOVE

   In what exultant terms did Solomon describe his delight in
his beautiful bride? Song 4:16-5:1.


   The midpoint of the Song of Solomon depicts events occur-
ring on the wedding night. Alone with his bride, Solomon com-
pares her to a pleasant, fragrant, though locked garden (Song
4:12-15). She invites her groom to come to the garden and par-
take of it. Solomon accepts her invitation. The two delicately
crafted verses (Song 4:16; 5:1) describing the consummation of
their love are the central, or pivotal, point in the Song. They
form the exact middle of the Hebrew text, with 111 lines from
1:2 to 4:15, and 111 lines from 5:2 to 8:14.
   Since the marital union has been chosen by God to represent
His intimate relationship with His people, this focus within the
Song is exceedingly relevant.

  When is the consummation of the marriage between Christ
and His people? Rev. 19:7-9; 21:1-7, 9-11.


   The marriage ceremony for Christ, the heavenly Bridegroom,
and His people, the "saints" on this earth, comes to an end at the
conclusion of the pre-advent judgment. This event is followed by
the second coming of Jesus, when the heavenly Bridegroom
transports His pure bride to the heavenly New Jerusalem. (Com-
pare John 14:1-3; 1 Thess. 4:16-18.) Here for one thousand years
Christ and His bride, enjoying the fruits of His gracious love,
reign together in the heavenly kingdom. (See Rev. 20:4.)
   Revelation 21 describes the New Jerusalem as "a bride
adorned for her husband" (verse 2, RSV). John saw the "Bride,
the wife of the Lamb" (verse 9, RSV), the perfectly symmetrical
"holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God."
   The magnificence of the holy city represents the spiritual per-
fection of the saved who inhabit it. By the grace of Christ, they
have overcome the wiles of the devil. Just as the New Jerusalem
is perfect in all its features, so His people, filled with His right-
eous Holy Spirit, are spiritually perfect. The marriage covenant
entered into while the bride was still on earth now finds its
culmination in the eternal city of God.

  Have you come to know your heavenly Bridegroom as it is
your privilege to know Him?

pages of the chapter "In the Holy of Holies," The Great Contro-
versy, pp. 426-428.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What aspects of this lesson have helped you to understand
     the Song of Solomon better?

  2. In what way has this lesson brought the hope mentioned
     in our memory verse to your life?

  3. To whom can you extend this hope by sharing your per-
     sonal testimony about the blessings of Scripture in your
     life?

SUMMARY: The Song of Solomon can be given both a literal
and a figurative meaning. The legitimate delight that a happily
married couple take in one another is a symbol of the mutual
delight of Christ and His people. As the fruition of married
love brings joy and ecstasy to husband and wife, so the con-
summation of Christ's marriage to His church will result in
rapturous delight that will be eternal.

         Quests of the Heart




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S LESSON: Song 1:2-8.

     MEMORY TEXT: "But now, thus says the Lord, who cre-
     ated you, 0 Jacob, and He who formed you, 0 Israel: 'Fear
     not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by your
     name; you are Mine' " (Isaiah 43:1, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: An assurance of personal worth is essen-
tial to the building of close relationships.

   A SENSE OF PERSONAL VALUE. The Song of Solomon
opens with three brief reflections by Shulamith of early married
life at the palace with her king-husband. The desire for love and
attention that she expresses at the outset sets the tone for the
poem. These are but part of her heart longings. She seeks the
assurance that she is truly accepted, that she truly belongs. This
quest she has in common with all women and men everywhere,
in all time. Her dialogue with her husband and her attendants
gives an opportunity for us to reflect on the universal human
concern for the feeling of personal value.
   This fundamental human need affects our sense of well-
being and shapes our relationships with others. To uncover this
quest of the heart is to discover at the same time a deeper
understanding of God and why we need Him and those who
love Him in our lives.

Sunday                                          October 25
GLIMPSES OF A LONGING HEART
  What urgent plea does Shulamith make to her husband?
Song 1:2. How is this verse a keynote to the poem?

   The poem begins by capturing our attention with her frank
and open expression of her desire for affection. This unusual
book, containing extraordinary self-disclosure by both husband
and wife, begins with a request for love. It ends with a similar
request, though one that is veiled in symbolic language (Song
8:14). "Love" in Song 1:2 translates the Hebrew word that in-
cludes the connotations of physical love-making and interper-
sonal relations rather than love as an abstract idea. (See Prov.
7:18; Eze. 16:8; 23:17.) The Song uses the plural form here and
again in 1:4; 4:10, and 7:12, signifying "acts of love-making."
   An interesting poetic style. In the Song of Solomon we find
occasional shifts between the use of third- and second-personal
pronouns. Song 1:2, "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his
mouth, for thy love is better than wine." The sense is, "0 that
you would kiss me with the kisses of your mouth!" (RSV).
   Who else does the wife see drawn to her husband as to the
scent of a fine perfume? Song 1:3, 4 (last part).

   The bride is aware that others also are attracted to Solomon.
The group of young women, with whom she dialogues
throughout the Song, cheer the king as he enters with his queen
into their private room: "We will be glad and rejoice in you. We
will remember your [Solomon's] love more than wine" (Song
1:4, NKJV).
   Shulamith is not naive about this courtly sentiment. She has
already acknowledged, "The maidens love you" (1:3, RSV).
Now she declares, "Rightly do they love you" (1:4, RSV). Why
this twice-repeated comment about other women's loving him?
She bestows her compliment generously. But, given the whole
tenor of the section (1:2-8) of which this is a part, it seems that
she speaks with a degree of wistfulness. Her query seems to
invite a response from him.
  Do you hear a wistfulness, a longing in Shulamith's voice?
What response is she seeking from her husband? What re-
sponse should Solomon give to her?

                                                                35
Monday                                          October 26
A COMMITTED WIFE

   Why does Shulamith speak as she does to the daughters of
Jerusalem? Song 1:5, 6.


   She senses the difference between her background, her per-
sonal appearance, her preparation for life in the palace, com-
pared to the fair women who have been polished at court
(verses 5, 6). Because Shulamith was expected to work in the
family vineyards, she was deeply tanned.

     What is the meaning of "my own vineyard"? Song 1:6.


   A major symbol in the Song. Shulamith may well have
owned her own vineyard. Something more, however, is intended
here. Her concern about her tanned complexion directly parallels
her statement about her "own vineyard" having gone unat-
tended. The vineyard refers to the woman herself. This symbol
broadens later to become a garden paradise (Song 4:12-5:1).
   A most important question. "Soul" (Song 1:7) describes the
whole being—spiritually, emotionally, mentally, and physi-
cally. This wife assures her husband of a lifelong love involving
her entire person. Marriage is total commitment for as long as
life shall last. Just so, our commitment to Jesus as Lord and
Saviour is forever.

  In the wife's question to Solomon, what do you think is her
concern? Song 1:7.


   Her question literally translated is, "Where do you pasture?
Where do you rest at noon?" She is inviting Solomon to spend
time with her, despite his involvement in heavy affairs of state.
   The reply seems to be from her attendants. Here they re-
spond to her as a newcomer to the court. It is appropriate for
her to seek Solomon ("follow in the footsteps of the flock,"
verse 8, NKJV). The reference to her as a shepherdess ("graze
your kids close to the shepherd's huts") is a metaphorical way
of suggesting that she has an important part to play as an equal
partner of the "shepherd" of Israel.

   Are Shulamith's concerns real? How is her situation similar
to that of both couples and friends today?
36
Tuesday                                          October 27
IN SEARCH OF HUMAN WORTH AND VALUE
   A fundamental human need. The feelings of Shulamith are
universal. Within every mind there lies a concern about one's
personal worth. This concern expresses itself more prominently
when we feel ourselves under scrutiny or in competition for
love and affection.
   How does Scripture show that one's innermost thoughts
influence powerfully the words and deeds of the life? Prov.
4:23; Matt. 12:34, 35 (compare Rom. 12:3; Gal. 6:3).

   Discover what worldly values are often used to evaluate
the worth of a person:
  • 2 Sam. 14:25; Prov. 31:30.
  • Isa. 5:21; 1 Cor. 1:20.
  • Jer. 9:23; Luke 12:15.
   A faulty system for encouraging personal worth. The typical
values of the fallen world around us tend to center on physical
beauty, intellectual sharpness, material wealth and possessions,
and our performance or accomplishments. Different cultures,
communities, even families, have different attitudes toward
these criteria. But the criteria themselves appear to be universal.
To the extent to which we fulfill the expectations of the culture in
which we live, to that extent our world considers us valuable.
   What evidences are there that the sense of values of the
following people was determined by the culture in which
they lived?
   • Hannah (1 Sam. 1:2, 6-11)
   • Esau (Gen. 27:1, 2, 32-41)
   • Jonah (Jonah 4:1-4)
   • Jesus' disciples (Matt. 20:20-24; Mark 9:33, 34)
   The world's evaluation of human worth is faulty:
   • It tends to focus 'On externals rather than the unseen needs
     of the heart.
   • It emphasizes what we can do by ourselves.
                                                                 37

A MESSAGE OF VALUE FROM GOD

   What two great acts of God are described in Isaiah 43:1-7?
With what tender words does God satisfy the human hunger
for value?


   Creation declares our value. A loving heavenly Parent
brought forth upon this planet the first human beings, invested
them with His image, and declared them very good (Gen. 1:27,
31). We are not the products of a chance evolution, but the handi-
work of a loving and gracious God. (See Heb. 2:6, 7; Jer. 1:5).
   Even in our fallen condition, we are still of great value to our
Creator. To some extent, all human beings are bearers of the
divine image. James 3:8-10 implies that our treatment of people
should reflect their creation in the likeness of God.

  What second act of God in our behalf expresses the worth
He attaches to every soul? 1 Peter 1:18, 19.


   What greater evidence could we have of the infinite value God
places on each of us than the sacrificial condescension of Jesus in
leaving heaven's courts and taking upon Himself our human na-
ture, living in poverty, working for degraded humans, bearing
our guilt on the cross, and rising to give us newness of life?
   "The value of a soul, who can estimate? Would you know its
worth, go to Gethsemane, and there watch with Christ through
those hours of anguish, when He sweat as it were great drops of
blood. Look upon the Saviour uplifted on the cross. Hear that
despairing cry, 'My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?'
Mark 15:34. Look upon the wounded head, the pierced side, the
marred feet. Remember that Christ risked all. For our redemp-
tion, heaven itself was imperiled. At the foot of the cross, re-
membering that for one sinner Christ would have laid down
His life, you may estimate the value of a soul."—Christ's Object
Lessons, p. 196.

   "Satan's work is to discourage the soul. Christ's work is to
inspire the heart with faith and hope."—Mind, Character, and
Personality, vol. 1, p. 32. What means does Satan use to cause
us to feel valueless? How does the good news of personal
worth make a difference in our lives? When do we most need
this confirmation of value?

A DIVINE PLAN FOR FASHIONING CHARACTER

   Because He understands the human need to be valued,
God has supplied abundant resources to encourage and
strengthen us when our own hearts condemn us and when
Satan capitalizes on our discouraging moments:
   • The truths about our worth given in God's Word (Matt.
     10:30, 31).
   • The ministry of Christ in heaven for us (Heb. 2:17, 18).
   • The companionship of Christ through the presence of the
     Holy Spirit in our hearts (John 15:26; 16:7-13; 17:23-26).
   • Prayer power and the "boundless resources of Om-
     nipotence" (Steps to Christ, p. 95; John 15:7).
   • Guidelines for physical, mental, and spiritual health that
     promote a sense of well-being (3 John 2).
   • One another, in the family and in the church—to love,
     care, and appreciate (1 John 2:10).

  How does Scripture direct us to become involved in en-
couraging one another? 1 Thess. 5:11; Rom. 14:19.


   What prediction did Isaiah make regarding Jesus' ministry?
Isa. 42:3 (compare Matt. 12:20). How does this describe Jesus'
view of human need and His subsequent ministry to all?


   "The Lord would have us ever to urge the worth of the
human soul upon those who do not understand its value."—
Evangelism, p. 461. In His redemptive ministry Jesus ap-
proached human beings gently. He spoke the truth, but always
with compassion born of understanding.
   A Spirit-directed assurance of personal worth is vital to good
health and good relationships! Family bonds are stronger when
the individuals within them possess good feelings about their
personal worth, and when those feelings are encouraged and
supported. The response of her husband will be very important
to Shulamith. She needs to hear some things from him that
many men have difficulty putting into words. Likewise he
needs to hear from her, because his heart also is searching for
reassurance and acceptance.

   Discuss with a friend or your spouse some of the practical
things Jesus did that made people love Him. Find ways to do
similar things for your friend, your spouse, or your child.
                                                              39
Friday                                                October 30
FURTHER STUDY: Consider Jesus' method of giving people a
sense of self-worth: Luke 10:29-37; 15:3-7; 11-32. Read "This
Man Receiveth Sinners," Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 185-197.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Think about and share the following with your spouse or
     close friend:
     a. Times when you feel good about yourself.
     b. Times when you feel unsure, discouraged, not so valu-
        able.
     c. Things you can say and do that increase your sense of
        personal worth.
     2. What steps do you take to reassure your spouse or your
        friends when they lose respect for themselves? Are your
        attempts successful? If not, why not?
SUMMARY: The Song of Solomon begins with Shulamith ex-
pressing doubts as to her beauty and acceptability. Uncertainty
and insecurity crave acceptance and reassurance. As we learn
to respect ourselves because of the love of our heavenly Bride-
groom, we are able to relate with empathy toward others.

       Love Finds a Voice




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S LESSON: Song 1:9-2:7.

  MEMORY TEXT: "He brought me to the banqueting
  house, and his banner over me was love" (Song 2:4).

   KEY THOUGHT: Communication is the lifeline of any rela-
tionship. Various methods of communication are essential to
happiness within any friendship or marriage.

   EXPRESSIONS OF APPRECIATION BRING HAPPI-
NESS. One of the unique features of the Song of Solomon is
that all its content is dialogue, primarily between Solomon
and Shulamith. To have crafted it this way is a fitting stroke
of poetic genius, for this format matches one of the dominant
themes of the Song: the delight in the human voice. "Let me
hear your voice," begs Solomon of her, "for your voice is
sweet" (Song 2:14, NIV; compare 8:13). Shulamith rejoices in
the voice of her beloved (Song 2:8; compare 5:2). The look of
the eyes, the hearing of the ears, the touch of the hand, all
have their important parts to play in linking us with one
another. But nothing quite matches the ability of the voice
with word and tone to share the intent of the heart. This the
Song celebrates. To the poet, of course, the sound of the
voice itself is not the ultimate cause for rejoicing. What is
significant is the communion of two hearts finding ways to
express their fondness for each other.
                                                            41
Sunday                                         November 1
TERMS OF ENDEARMENT

   "We need more sunshiny parents and more sunshiny Chris-
tians. We are too much shut up within ourselves."—The Adventist
Home, p. 37. "Let the husband and wife study each other's happi-
ness, never failing in the small courtesies and little kindly acts
that cheer and brighten the life."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 393.

  How did the happiness of Solomon and Shulamith find
expression in their affectionate names for each other?
  • His name for her: Song 1:9 (compare 1:15; 4:1, 7).


   With Solomon's first words in the poem we hear him call his
bride by the endearing term "my love" ("my darling"—NIV;
"my dearest"—NEB). She in turn uses the masculine form of
this word of him in Song 5:16, where it is translated "my
friend." "My intimate friend" or "my loving friend" seems to
be what Solomon's affectionate name for her means.

     • Her name for him: Song 1:13 (compare 2:3, 8-10.)


   The bride's most frequent favorite name for her husband,
used more than twenty times, is "my well-beloved" ("my
beloved"—RSV, "my lover"—NIV). The daughters of Jerusa-
lem and other friends use the term to refer to him (Song 5:9; 6:1;
8:5) and to them both on one occasion (Song 5:1).

   Note the first compliment in the Song addressed to the
bride. Song 1:9. Compare this with others given her; for exam-
ple, Song 4:1, 2; 7:4. Under what circumstances were they
given? How do you think they were received?


   An ornamented mare? Her hair like a flock of goats on a
mountainside? Teeth like newly washed and shorn sheep? At
first glance, this extolling of the wife seems hardly complimen-
tary! In their intimate moments, both husband and wife strain
language to the utmost in expressing their love. Comparisons to
animals, precious stones, metals, spices, and fruits help them
give voice to their feelings.

  How do honest compliments form a part of the communi-
cation of love?

THE IMPORTANCE OF COMPLIMENTS

   How does Shulamith's compliment of Solomon convey her
feelings of love? Song 1:12-14. What do the expensive fra-
grances mentioned in these verses suggest? Compare
Shulamith's choice of language with Solomon's in Song 1:9.


  In what ways do compliments help fulfill the Christian
commandment described in Romans 12:10?


   The word for "kindly affectioned" (KJV) combines two
Greek words for "love" to give the sense of "heartfelt love,"
"loving dearly." A second word in the text, "honor," comes
from the root meaning "to give great value 10." Honest compli-
ments appropriately given are like sunshine to relationships.
They are an important way in which we elevate another
person's sense of worth.

   Study Jesus' contacts with the following individuals to dis-
cover His masterful use of the compliment. How were His
attitudes and actions toward them, as well as His words, an
affirming touch of His grace? How did they prepare the hearts
of His hearers for deeper relationships with Him?

  Mary (Matt. 26:10-13).

  Zaccheus (Luke 19:5-10).

  The Samaritan woman (John 4:5-26, 39).

   The Saviour binds others to Himself. Each of these personal
encounters was a miracle, an emotional and spiritual resurrec-
tion that brought with it new life and hope and a strong desire
to be connected with Him.
   "Kind words, looks of sympathy, expressions of apprecia-
tion, would be to many a struggling and lonely one as the cup
of cold water to a thirsty soul. A word of sympathy, an act of
kindness, would lift burdens that rest heavily upon weary
shoulders."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 23.
  What "miracle" have you experienced in your life as a re-
sult of a compliment paid to you?

                                                             43

LOVING COMMUNICATION

   In Song 1:9-2:6, Solomon and Shulamith are engaged in dia-
logue. Their communication may appear at times as trivial. But
notice several things occurring that are important to close rela-
tionships.
   • They offer each other sincere compliments.
   • They use endearing terms for each other.
   • They talk together face to face.
   • They express feeling through touch.

   Toward deeper levels of communication. The dialogue of
Solomon and Shulamith parallels what experts tell us about
how communication leads to close relationships. Whether in
marriage or single life, as friendships grow closer, there is
greater and greater trust in another person, and more and more
openness. The deeper the relationship, the more it will include
the sharing of feelings and self-disclosure. The atmosphere of
comfort and security that affectionate names and compliments
produce paves the way for more meaningful sharing.

   What is significant about the bride referring to herself as
"the rose of Sharon" and "the lily of the valley" in Song 2:1?


   The descriptions "rose of Sharon" and "lily of the valley"
(Song 2:1) are titles often given to Christ. (See Education, p. 120.)
Both grammar and context indicate that these words are spoken
by Shulamith herself. The flowers to which she compares her-
self are simple and common wild flowers of Palestine. Her
statement has a twofold significance:
   1. The openness revealed in Song 2:1 is deeply moving.
Shulamith wishes to be viewed as a simple flower waiting to be
appreciated. Her words indicate self-disclosure in their relation-
ship. She trusts him with her plainness, her simple rustic
beauty, and her ordinariness.
   2. Her identification of herself as a "lily" reveals another of
the Song's symbols representing a woman. It provides a key to
interpretation of later verses of the poem. (See 2:16; 4:5; 6:3.)

   What part have expressions of appreciation played in your
personal relationships, either within or outside of marriage?
Why does failure to express appreciation have a negative ef-
fect on: (a) a marriage; (b) a parent-child relationship; (c) a
work relationship; (d) a friendship?

COMMUNICATION ESSENTIAL TO TRUST
  How does Solomon show that Shulamith can trust him
with her feelings about herself? Song 2:2.

   Even though she feels unworthy, because the king deeply
loves her, she is in a most favored position. As a wise listener,
Solomon accepts her and what she says. He does not seek to
correct her. She has revealed to him her inner self, and this
makes her all the more winsome and attractive. To him she is a
woman of surpassing qualities.
   By what attitudes and actions can you extend an invitation
to deeper communication with those you love?

   To what enjoyable experiences does the bride liken her
relationship with her beloved? Song 2:3.

   Ideally, communication that includes trust, openness, and ex-
pressions of love leads to a closeness marked by a sense of
security, restfulness, and contentment. "Let the husband aid his
wife by his sympathy and unfailing affection. If he wishes to
keep her fresh and gladsome, so that she will be as sunshine in
the home, let him help her bear her burdens. His kindness and
loving courtesy will be to her a precious encouragement, and
the happiness he imparts will bring joy and peace to his own
heart."—The Adventist Home, p. 218.
   Sitting under God's shadow. "We need to appreciate more
fully the meaning of the words: 'I sat down under his shadow
with great delight.' Song of Solomon 2:3. These words do not
bring to our minds the picture of hasty transit, but of quiet rest.
There are many professing Christians who are anxious and de-
pressed, many who are so full of busy activity that they cannot
find time to rest quietly in the promises of God, who act as if
they could not afford to have peace and quietness. To all such
Christ's invitation is: 'Come unto me, . . . and I will give you
rest.' Matthew 11:28."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 69.
   Think of an experience you have had relaxing beneath a
shady tree. What feelings engulf you as you remember? Which
of these feelings could you use to express your feelings for your
spouse? for a family member? for a close friend? for God?
                                                                45
Thursday                                        November 5
"HE LOOKED ON ME WITH LOVE"

  What is the meaning of the phrase "his banner over me
was love" (Song 2:4)? What do you think led Shulamith to
make this exclamation?


   The Hebrew word for "banner" is commonly used for
"standard," "flag," or "ensign." (See Num. 1:52.) Some have
envisioned a kind of protective awning fashioned for her by the
king from his flag. Others translate the verse: "His look upon
me was in love" or "He looked on me with love." (See G. Lloyd
Can, The Song of Solomon, p. 91.) Song 2:4 describes the all-
encompassing satisfaction given by love and its expression.
   "There are many who regard the expression of love as a
weakness, and they maintain a reserve that repels others. This
spirit checks the current of sympathy. . . . Love cannot long exist
without expression. Let not the heart of one connected with you
starve for the want of kindness and sympathy."—The Ministry
of Healing, p. 360.

  The Lord's "banner over us" is loving also. Well may we
marvel at the extent of His affection for us. Study the follow-
ing passages. How do they proclaim the extent of God's love?

     Lam. 3:22, 23

     Ps. 63:3

     Eph. 2:4-7

     1 John 3:1

    "Your Heavenly Father will take from you the garments
defiled by sin. . . . God will clothe you with 'the garments of
salvation,' and cover you with 'the robe of righteousness.' Isa.
61:10. . . . He will bring you into His banqueting house, and His
banner over you shall be love. (Cant. 2:4). . . . 'As the bride-
groom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over
thee.' Isa. 62:5." —Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 206, 207. (See also
Education, p. 261; Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 131.)

  What does God's love for you do for your sense of self-
worth? How can you communicate to others, not only your
care, but also God's infinite concern for them?

FURTHER STUDY: Study Jesus' method of communicating
His love: Luke 7:36-50. Read "The Feast at Simon's House" in
The Desire of Ages, pp. 559-568; The Ministry of Healing, p. 360.
    "Though difficulties, perplexities, and discouragements may
arise, let neither husband nor wife harbor the thought that their
union is a mistake or a disappointment. Determine to be all that
it is possible to be to each other. Continue the early attentions.
In every way encourage each other in fighting the battles of life.
Study to advance the happiness of each other. Let there be mu-
tual love, mutual forbearance. Then marriage, instead of being
the end of love, will be as it were the very beginning of love."—
The Ministry of Healing, p. 360.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How may the principles mentioned in the above quotation
     be applied in relationships other than marriage?
  2. What has the phrase "His banner over me was love"
     meant for you?
   3. In what way do the principles of communication dis-
      cussed in this lesson help us to understand prayer?
   4. How might worship with a friend or spouse lead to a
      deeper experience with God?
   5. What steps do you plan to pursue to make a deeper ex-
      perience with God a reality?
   6. Think about and share the following with your spouse or
      close friend:
      a. Areas in your relationship where you feel communica-
         tion is very good.
      b. Areas in your relationship in which there is room for
         improvement in communication.
      c. Some areas you avoid communicating about.
      d. Things you can do to open communication in areas in
         which there is now little or no communication.
  SUMMARY: Communication is vital to a relationship.
Through communication with one another we reveal the long-
ings of our hearts and find the answers to those longings. For
communication to build a relationship, there must be trust,
openness, and expressions of love.

  The Ingredients of
Meaningful Relationships




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S LESSON: Song 2:8-17.

     MEMORY TEXT: "My beloved is mine, and I am his"
     (Song 2:16).

   KEY THOUGHT: Careful attention to the details of God's
plan for the formation of close relationships yields lasting
friendships and marriages.

   THE PROCESS OF HUMAN BONDING. The segment of
the Song of Solomon that we will study this week contains
reflections from before and after the wedding of Solomon and
Shulamith. In the opening lines (Song 2:8-15) the wife recalls
some of their very special courtship experiences. These verses
serve to highlight the importance of this period for couples.
Their courtship and betrothal provided a foundation for their
commitment to each other and the closeness they enjoyed in
marriage (Song 2:16, 17).
   With these glimpses into different phases of the relationship
of this pair, the Song illustrates the fascinating process of
human bonding. It affords us the opportunity to take a closer
look at the predictable pattern of relationship formation, seem-
ingly inscribed on the human heart since Creation.

COURTSHIP MEMORIES

   Describe the event recalled in Song 2:8, 9. What kinds of
feeling are present in Shulamith? in Solomon? To what does
Shulamith compare her beloved?


   Solomon is like a "roe" ("gazelle"—RSV) or a young "hart"
("stag"—RSV). These beautiful, graceful animals help describe
the physical charms and attributes of the spouse. (Compare
Prov. 5:19; Song 2:7, 16, 17.)

  What is the purpose of Solomon's visit? Song 2:10-13.


    The springtime of a relationship. The king visited
Shulamith's mountain home to ask her to join him in a spring-
time outing amid the beauties of nature. The excitement, the
romance, the promise of this budding relationship is conveyed
through the lines, and between the lines, of the Song.
    During the period of engagement, the structure of a couple's
marital relationship is being shaped. Adequate preparation is
needed for the important commitment about to be made.
    "The family tie is the closest, the most tender and sacred, of
any on earth. It was designed to be a blessing to mankind. And
it is a blessing wherever the marriage covenant is entered into
intelligently, in the fear of God, and with due consideration for
its responsibilities."—The Ministry of Healing, pp. 356, 357.

  Anyone contemplating marriage should think carefully
about the following questions. Most of these questions are rele-
vant for us all, regardless of our marital plans. Can you answer
each question positively? Of which are you uncertain? Discuss
your answers with God in prayer. Seek confirmation of your
marriage plans from your parents, your pastor, a relative, or
another whom you trust as a spiritual guide.

   Evaluating your personal preparation. Is my relationship
with Jesus Christ personally satisfying? Do I have a positive
outlook on life? Can I bear responsibility? Do I have an objec-
tive for my lifework? Am I a source of encouragement to
others? Do I relate to my parents in an adult way? Do I re-
cover quickly when I am emotionally hurt or angry? Am I
ready to make a commitment to one person? Do others feel I
am ready for marriage?
                                                               49
Monday                                          November 9
SELECTING A POTENTIAL LIFE PARTNER
   Many questions should be considered: Is this person com-
mitted to Jesus Christ? Is he or she personally prepared for
marriage? Do I have a strong conviction that this person values
much the same things in life as I do? Do I love this person
deeply despite the flaws I can see and others that I have yet to
discover? Can I be flexible and accommodating regarding the
ways in which this person is and will be different from me?
Would our marriage strengthen us both spiritually? Can this
marriage be blessed in our church? Do others feel I know this
person well enough?
   Preparing as a couple. Have we prayed often together? Have
we shared our thoughts and feelings about God, church, Chris-
tian service, careers, money, sexuality, in-laws, children? Do we
know and accept each other's family? Have we planned how to
reach our goals in life and how to adjust if we cannot reach
them? Have we discussed our respective responsibilities within
marriage? Can we trust each other with our deepest fears?
Have we honestly compared our expectations of each other,
including the things we'd like to change in each other? Does
our love-bond allow the individuality of each? Do we know by
experience that we can solve problems and handle conflicts
well together? Will we have the support of relatives and friends
in our marriage?
  What attitude toward Shulamith is displayed by Solomon?
Song 2:14.

   Charming ways of the heart. Solomon affirms Shulamith's
special qualities and conveys his wishes as an invitation, not a
command. An invitation recognizes that fundamental feature
with which the Creator has endowed every human being—the
ability to think, the freedom to choose. True love invites; selfish
love coerces, commands, threatens, or otherwise pressures the
object of its passion to comply.
   How does God recognize the sovereignty of the human
will? Joshua 24:15 (compare Isa. 55:1; Matt. 11:28; Rev. 22:17).

  What are some of the pressures that we sometimes exert on
our friends? on our marriage partner? on our family? How
does this bring hurt, frustration, or fear?

FORMULA FOR MARRIAGE

   With what words does the Song focus on the heart of the
divine plan for marriage? Song 2:16.


   Distilled essence of marriage. The fundamental theme of the
Song of Solomon resides in these profound words, "My beloved
is mine and I am his." (This is the "one flesh" described in
Genesis 2:24.) Song 6:3 repeats the thought in reverse and Song
7:10 modifies it. French expositor Andre Feuillet beautifully
termed it "the formula of mutual belonging." Belonging means
mutual giving, attachment, devotion, and promise. All these are
tied up in this cryptic package, this miniature marriage-
covenant formula. Because Christ is our heavenly Bridegroom,
we are His and He is ours. (See 1 Cor. 3:21-23.)

    What is the significance of the phrase "he feeds among the
lilies"? Song 2:16; 6:2, 3 (compare the differing uses of "feed"
or "feeding" in Job 1:14; Hosea 12:1; Isa. 14:30).


   The Hebrew word feed may be used in the sense of feeding
someone, something, or oneself, as fits the context best. In the
symbols of the Song, Shulamith is a "lily" (Song 2:1, 2), her
beloved, a "gazelle" (Song 2:9, 17). Her husband is a caring
companion, one she trusts, to whom she has opened her life,
with whom she has made a marriage covenant. To her he is not
a marauding fox, wantonly rampaging and spoiling tender
grapes, but a gentle gazelle who "browses" (NW), taking emo-
tional and physical delight in her.

   This passage opened with Solomon's invitation to
Shulamith to go with him on an outing in the mountains.
With what invitation by Shulamith to her husband does this
section of the Song close? Song 2:17.


   Some have interpreted this as Shulamith's bidding her be-
loved Godspeed as he returns home. Other interpreters see this
verse as an invitation by Shulamith for Solomon to enjoy close
spiritual and physical communion with her.

  What does the knowledge that you are Christ's and He is
yours do for your outlook on life and your relationships?

DIVINE DESIGN FOR BONDING IN RELATIONSHIPS

  How does Genesis 2:24, 25 portray a pattern in forming the
marriage bond?


   The joining or bonding process for men and women in mar-
riage is summarized in the Creation account with the progres-
sion implied in the words "leave," "cleave," "one flesh."

   In what way does the word cleave or join summarize a
relationship-building process? Gen. 2:24; Matt. 19:6.


   A bonding script. Cleave or cling means "to adhere," "to
stick together." (Compare 2 Sam. 23:10; Job 41:17; Dan. 2:43.)
The psalmist clung to the testimonies of the Lord (Ps. 119:31).
The word is used of the strong attraction that draws two
together in a close relationship, such as in marriage (Gen.
2:24), in friendship (Prov. 18:24), or with God (Deut. 10:20). It
is evident that this "cleaving," this relationship-building pro-
cess, takes place in similar ways in all human beings, giving
evidence of the Creator's handiwork.

   What physical faculties are involved in relationship forma-
tion?

     Gen. 12:14, 15; Song 4:9

     Judges 14:7; Song 2:14

     Gen. 26:8; Song 2:6

     Song 1:3, 12; 4:10

     Song 2:3; 5:1

   Relationships between people are formed through complex
interactions involving the physical, emotional, mental, and spir-
itual aspects of our beings. Sight, hearing, and touch play vital
roles in bonding.

  How have you observed bonding operating between par-
ents and their infants? between friends? between couples pre-
paring for marriage? between married couples?

BONDS OF HEAVENLY ORIGIN

   Sin has marred the script for human bonding and the human
sexuality with which it is so closely linked. Human beings still
seek relationships, but do so now with scarred and weakened
natures. And their notions of love and sexuality often are con-
fused or perverted. God's redeeming grace and power are
needed to guide this human bonding process and ensure the
quality of relationships.

   How does Paul in Ephesians treat this need for renewal in
relationships? In what ways does the gospel build on the
natural laws of human bonding? How does it change or modi-
fy them? Eph. 2:13-18; 3:16-19 (compare 4:1-3; 5:1-7).


  The changes necessary for Christlike relationships to develop
are brought about by God Himself. In Christ, He deals with the
evil that obstructs human bonding, including the most signifi-
cant bond of all—that between the soul and God. In Christ, God
bonds us with Himself. He works the miracle of conversion in
our minds and hearts. With a new heart come new affections.
We are able now to "walk in love" (Eph. 5:2). As we partake of
Christ's mind, we have a new appreciation of His will and a
deep desire to learn of Him. Our human love and sexuality are
schooled by His Word, directed and disciplined by His Spirit.
   We are to be transformed spiritually and emotionally. In
the plan of salvation, the need for bonding, which the loving
Creator implanted in human hearts, is redeemed. No longer is it
dominated by the corrupt whims, lusts, infidelities, and broken
promises of the fallen heart. The covenant love of a new mind
and a transformed heart brings kindness, tenderheartedness,
forgiveness, and endurance that does not die when severely
tested. By grace, relationship formation becomes a dramatic
production directed by the Holy Spirit.
   "Men and women can reach God's ideal for them if they will
take Christ as their helper. What human wisdom cannot do, His
grace will accomplish for those who give themselves to Him in
loving trust. His providence can unite hearts in bonds that are of
heavenly origin."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 362.

   How do you plan to deepen the ties you have with family
and friends? Think in terms of the physical, emotional, and
spiritual changes you can make in your approach.

                                                               53

FURTHER STUDY: Study the guidelines for developing rela-
tionships in Ephesians 5:19-6:9. Read "Ministry of the Home,"
and "The Builders of the Home" in The Ministry of Healing, pp.
349-362.

   "It is only in Christ that a marriage alliance can be safely
formed. Human love should draw its closest bonds from divine
love. Only where Christ reigns can there be deep, true, unselfish
affection.
   "Love is a precious gift, which we receive from Jesus. Pure
and holy affection is not a feeling, but a principle. Those who
are actuated by true love are neither unreasonable nor blind.
Taught by the Holy Spirit, they love God supremely, and their
neighbor as themselves."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 358.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Think about and share the following with your spouse or
     close friend:
     a. An important reason we have become friends is . . .

       b. I enjoy talking to you because . . .

       c. I am drawn closest to the Lord by . . .

     2. Think of the closest human relationship you enjoy. What
        would you say is the most important influence binding
        you to this person? What other secondary factors are also
        important?

SUMMARY: The Song of Solomon pictures for us the bonding
process between a man and a woman, from courtship days to
the enjoyment of happy marriage. The principles set forth in
God's Word are the only safe guides to formation of close rela-
tionships, whether they are friendships or romantic attach-
ments.

 Marriage That Gladdens
       the Heart




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S LESSON: Song 3:6-11.

  MEMORY TEXT: "Let marriage be held in honor among
  all" (Hebrews 13:4, RSV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Though sin has perverted the original de-
sign for marriage given in Eden, by faith in the restoring power
of Christ husbands and wives today may experience the purity
and beauty of marriage that God intended.

   CHRIST RESTORES IDEAL MARRIAGE. Sin has wrought
more havoc with marriage than with most of God's gifts to us.
Ideas regarding marriage and marriage practices often fall far
short of God's original design. Yet, in Christ, that which sin has
corrupted is restored. If we will permit it to do so, His truth will
make our marriages in every way an honor to Him.
   Couples wanting to implement God's ideal confront conflicts
between tradition and truth, dominance and submission, servi-
tude and companionship, lust and love. The life of every couple
is a stage on which the great controversy in miniature is played
out.
   Our study this week traces the beginning of married life for
Solomon and Shulamith and considers the effects of sin and the
grace of redemption on their marriage.
                                                                 55

A WEDDING REMEMBERED
  How does Song 3:6-10 describe the wedding day and wed-
ding procession of Solomon and Shulamith?

   The reminiscence begins with a view of the wedding proces-
sion. The smoke of verse 6 "probably refers to the custom of
heading a procession with burning incense which pervades the
route of the procession with fragrant odors. This is an ancient
and common custom in the East."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol.
3, p. 1117. The "bed" ("carriage," NIV) of verse 7 and the
"chariot" ("carriage," NIV) of verse 9 are references to
Solomon's portable carriage.
  Who else share in the happiness of the wedding day? What
custom does the act of the queen mother reflect? Song 3:10, 11.

   The daughters of Jerusalem expressed their joy in the royal
pair by their work on the royal carriage. "The paving with love
may refer to verses worked on the counterpane, the hangings,
or the carpet by the daughters of Jerusalem as an expression of
their love for King Solomon and his bride."—SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 3, p. 1117.
   "The crowning by his mother indicates that this is a celebra-
tory crowning, for the royal crowning was carried out by the
divine representative, the High Priest. . . . Until the destruction
of Jerusalem by Rome in AD 70, 'crowns' were worn by ordi-
nary brides and bridegrooms."—G. Lloyd Carr, The Song of
Solomon (Downers Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press, 1984), p. 113.
   A social dimension to marriage. In the biblical understand-
ing, marriage is a covenant promise with both religious and
social dimensions. Couples pledge to God, to each other, and to
society to be faithful to each other. Support by family and
friends greatly enhances the likelihood of a successful marriage.
   How does Song 3:11 describe the wedding day? (Compare
Ps. 4:7 and Isa. 51:3.)

   Why are family celebrations of such events as baby dedica-
tions, birthdays, baptisms, weddings, and anniversaries im-
portant? How can the memory of a wedding day help sustain
marriage in difficult times?

IN THE BEGINNING

   How does Jesus help His hearers understand the meaning
of marriage? How does His summary of Edenic marriage draw
upon both Genesis 1 and 2? Matt. 19:3-8.


  In the Genesis 2 record of the creation of man and woman,
what human need did God express? How did God purpose to
meet this need? Gen. 2:18-23.


   "It is not good that the man should be alone." Humans are by
His design social beings, with a need for fellowship. "I will make
a helper suitable for him" (NIV). "Helper" (Heb. ezer) literally
means "help" or "succor." The majority of Old Testament uses of
this word portray God helping, supporting in one way or an-
other. (See Deut. 33:7, 26, 29; Ps. 70:5; 121:1, 2.) Adam's "helper"
was to be one with whom he could share mutual love, care, and
understanding. She would be a source of spiritual and emotional
encouragement. Helper "is a relational term, describing a benefi-
cial relationship, but in itself does not specify position or rank,
either superiority or inferiority."—Richard M. Davidson, "The
Theology of Sexuality in the Beginning: Genesis 1-2," Andrews
University Seminary Studies, Spring 1988, p. 15.

  In what special way did God provide this "helper" for
Adam? Gen. 2:21, 22.


   Adam played no active part in woman's creation. Raw ma-
terial, "one of his ribs," was removed from Adam. The two gen-
ders are thus of the same earthly "dust" material. (Compare Gen.
2:7; 3:19.) The selection of the bone from Adam's side further sig-
nifies that man and woman were equal. "Eve was created from a
rib taken from the side of Adam, signifying that she was not to
control him as the head, nor to be trampled under his feet as an
inferior, but to stand by his side as an equal, to be loved and pro-
tected by him."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 46.

   In what ways are the two kinds of human (male and female)
alike and different? In your own words, how would you de-
scribe the relationship between man and woman as God origi-
nally designed it? What advantages would such a relationship
have for husbands and wives today?
                                                                 57
Tuesday                                        November 17
EQUAL PARTNERS

   How do the new terms for man and woman, introduced after
the creation of woman, indicate God's plan for the harmonious
relationship of the sexes? Gen. 2:23 (compare Gen. 1:26-28).


   With the arrival of woman, the sexual distinctiveness of the
two genders of humankind becomes evident. The word for man,
until now only adam, is now ish, and the word for woman
ishshah. They are two beings, yet complementary, harmonious
parts of one humanity. So complete was this oneness "in the
day when they were created" that they had one name, Adam,
given them by God (Gen. 5:2). Only after the account of the Fall
do we read of the name Eve being given the woman (Gen. 3:20).

  How do the two accounts of the creation of man and
woman complement each other? Gen. 1:26-28; Gen. 2:18-23.
What special emphasis does Genesis 2:24, 25 give?


   Both passages join in according full human worth, dignity, re-
spect, and equality to the two genders. Genesis 1:26-28 indicates
that both man and woman bear the "image of God"; both are
given the same dominion as co-rulers over creatures of land, sea,
and sky; both share God's blessing and the responsibility for pro-
creation. Though sexually different, they are one. The singular
word adam is twice used to designate the human pair (verses 26,
27).
   Genesis 2 amplifies Genesis 1, detailing the process whereby
the man (ish) and woman (ishshah) came to be. The emphasis is
on the relational need of humanity and how the intimate bond
of marriage fulfills that need. In this account marriage is insti-
tuted (Gen. 2:24). "These words express the deepest physical
and spiritual unity of man and woman, and hold up monog-
amy before the world as the form of marriage ordained by God.
These words do not recommend a forsaking of filial duty and
respect toward father and mother, but refer primarily to the fact
that a man's wife is to be first in his affections and that his first
duty is toward her. His love for her is to exceed, though cer-
tainly not to supersede, a very proper love for his parents."—
SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 227.

  Why are the Bible records of the creation of man and
woman and the institution of marriage important to us?

MARRIAGE AFTER THE FALL

   How did sin affect the personal lives, as well as the mar-
riage, of the first couple? How did it change their relationship
to God? Gen. 3:1-24.


   Tragedy for marriage. Henceforth marriage would suffer
from the sinful tendency to exploit or dominate. Many future
marriages would know hostility, abuse, violence, lust, and un-
faithfulness. Many would know the searing pain of separation
and divorce. The ideal of an exclusive lifelong relationship be-
tween one man and one woman would be replaced by other
"marriage" forms.

   In what way is Genesis 3:16 significant to an understanding
of marriage after the Fall?


   Change in a delicate alignment. In their sinless state neither
of the sexes ruled the other. However, the divinely designed
qualities of masculinity and femininity were distorted by sin,
and their carefully balanced alignment in marriage was ad-
versely affected. The self-disciplined, selfless love, the sense of
fulfillment and peace, the mutual helping and willing submis-
sion to each other were radically altered.
   "Their union could be maintained and harmony preserved
only by submission on the part of the one or the other. . . . It was
by her [Eve's] solicitation that Adam sinned, and she was now
placed in subjection to her husband."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
p. 58. (Compare Eph. 5:21-26, 28-33;1 Tim. 2:13-15; 1 Peter 3:1-7.)
   Abuses in marriage. The Hebrew word in Genesis 3:16 for
the husband's rule has a range of meaning that includes "pro-
tection," "love," and "care."
   "Had the principles enjoined in the law of God been cher-
ished by the fallen race, this sentence, though growing out of
the results of sin, would have proved a blessing to them; but
man's abuse of the supremacy thus given him has too often
rendered the lot of woman very bitter and made her life a bur-
den."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 58, 59.

   How does the story of Ahasuerus and Vashti illustrate the
pattern of male domination by which marriage has often been
abused? Esther 1:9-22. Contrast this with the Edenic ideal re-
flected in "My beloved is mine, and I am his" (Song 2:16).
                                                                 59
Thursday                                     November 19
HEIRS TOGETHER WITH CHRIST

   From perversion to purity. "Marriage has been perverted by
sin; but it is the purpose of the gospel to restore its purity and
beauty."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 64.

   Describe Christ's triumph over sin. How may we experi-
ence His triumph today? What is yet future? Col. 2:15; Eph.
2:1-7; Rom. 8:22, 23.


   In Christ, God restores marriage by redeeming husbands and
wives. Though we wait for full deliverance from the bondage of
corruption until His second coming, in Christ the kingdom of
God has now come to us. (See Matt. 12:28; Luke 17:21; 2 Cor.
5:17; Eph. 3:19.)

  How did Christ's teaching overturn the evils that sin had
brought to the relationship between the sexes? John 2:1-10;
Matt. 9:15; 20:25-28; Eph. 5:21-33; 1 Peter 3:1-7.


    Jesus "sanctioned marriage, recognizing it as an institution
that He Himself had established. . . . Christ honored the marriage
relation by making it also a symbol of the union between Him
and His redeemed ones. He Himself is the Bridegroom; the bride
is the church."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 356.
    The curse subjected the wife to the husband (compare Testi-
monies, vol. 3, p. 484). The gospel emphasizes the love and serv-
ice of husband and wife to each other. "Woman should fill the
position which God originally designed for her, as her
husband's equal. . . . She [the wife and mother] should feel that
she is her husband's equal—to stand by his side, she faithful at
her post of duty and he at his."—The Adventist Home, p. 231.
"The husband is to be the houseband of the family, the priest of
his home. The wife is to respect and love her husband, and he is
to love and cherish his wife. [Eph. 5:15-21 quoted]."—Ellen G.
White, Manuscript 161, 1902 (Manuscript release #1317, p. 1).
    Equal, yet different. "But I want you to understand that the
head of every man is Christ, the head of a woman is her hus-
band, and the head of Christ is God" (1 Cor. 11:3, RSV). Christ
and the Father are entirely equal (Col. 2:9), but they exercise
distinct functions within the Godhead. Similarly, man and
woman were created equal but with different functions within
the home.
60
Friday                                         November 20
FURTHER STUDY: Consider Jesus' respect for woman: John
4:6-30; 8:3-11; Luke 7:36-50; 10:38-42; 13:10-17. Read "Solemn
Promises" and "Mutual Obligations" in The Adventist Home, pp.
99-104, 114-120, 211-215; and "The Temptation and Fall" and
"The Plan of Redemption" in Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 52-70.
   "Neither the husband nor the wife should attempt to exercise
over the other an arbitrary control. Do not try to compel each
other to yield to your wishes. You cannot do this and retain
each other's love. Be kind, patient, and forbearing, considerate,
and courteous. By the grace of God you can succeed in making
each other happy, as in your marriage vow you promised to
do."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 361.
    "Christ came not to destroy this institution, but to restore it to
its original sanctity and elevation."—The Adventist Home, p. 99.
    "Neither husband nor wife is to make a plea for rulership. The
Lord has laid down the principle that is to guide in this matter.
The husband is to cherish his wife as Christ cherishes the church.
And the wife is to respect and love her husband. Both are to culti-
vate the spirit of kindness, being determined never to grieve or
injure the other."—Testimonies, vol. 7, p. 47.
    "The husband is the house-band of the home treasures, bind-
ing by his strong, earnest, devoted affection the members of the ,
household, mother and children, together in the strongest
bonds of union.
    "His name, 'house-band,' is the true definition of husband. . . .
I saw that but few fathers realize their responsibility. . . . The hus-
band and father is the head of the household. The wife looks to
him for love and sympathy and for aid in the training of the chil-
dren."—The Adventist Home, p. 211.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How does the gladness of Solomon's wedding illustrate
     the union between Christ, the Bridegroom, and the
     church, His bride? (See The Desire of Ages, p. 151.)
   2. How does God's grace draw our family relationships ever
      closer to the ideals of Eden?
SUMMARY: To a greater extent than we realize we may know
the life of Eden as God originally designed it. Christ is God's
answer for all that sin has done to marriage. Christ designed
that the energizing power of the Holy Spirit will enable cou-
ples in marriage to enjoy union and gladness.

                                                                   61

      A Unique and Tender
          Knowledge




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Song 4:1-5:1.

     MEMORY TEXT: "How delightful is your love, my sister,
     my bride! How much more pleasing is your love than
     wine, and the fragrance of your perfume than any spice!"
     (Song 4:10, NIV).

    KEY THOUGHT: Scripture celebrates the wholesomeness
and beauty of the divine gift of married love. This gift
illuminates the relationship between our loving Lord and His
devoted people.

   A SACRED THEME. The memory of Solomon and
Shulamith's wedding day forms the exquisite centerpiece of the
Song of Solomon. Song 3:6-11 has enabled us to glimpse the
public ceremony. The delicate metaphors of the verses that fol-
low (Song 4:1-5:1) contain the most tender and sublime scenes
from within human marriage that God in His Word has permit-
ted us to contemplate—the joy in one another experienced by a
devoted married couple.
   In the passage for this week's lesson we are privileged to
behold that which is holy. These extraordinary scenes are pur-
poseful. Through them the Holy Spirit would instruct us about
ourselves, about our married love, and, because He is the Crea-
tor of marriage, about Himself.

GOD'S IDEAL PERVERTED

   Despite God's plan for marriage, what sinister powers are
at war with Him, His followers, and His truth? 2 Cor. 4:3, 4;
Eph. 6:12.


   "Excluded from heaven, he [Satan] resolved to be avenged
by injuring the workmanship of God. . . . No sooner was man
created than Satan resolved to efface in him the image of God,
and to place his stamp where God's should be."—Ellen G.
White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1119.

   What attitude must believers have when God reveals sinful
attitudes and practices to them? Acts 3:19, 20; 17:30, 31.


  "Satan is ever on the alert to deceive and mislead. He is using
every enchantment to allure men into the broad road of disobedi-
ence. He is working to confuse the senses with erroneous senti-
ments, and remove the landmarks by placing his false inscription
on the signposts which God has established to point the right
way.. . . None need despair because of the inherited tendencies to
evil, but when the Spirit of God convicts of sin, the wrongdoer
must repent and confess and forsake the evil. Faithful sentinels
are on guard to direct souls in right paths."—Ellen G. White
Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1120.

  What effect did the traditions, customs, and false philoso-
phies encountered by Christ have on truth and human lives?
Mark 7:9, 13; Matt. 23:1-4, 13 (compare Col. 2:8).


   Erroneous or unbalanced views lead to an incomplete,
warped concept of God. They cause distortion in Christian de-
velopment or abandonment of God altogether. Like the enemy
in the parable of the wheat and tares (Matt. 13:24-30), Satan has
introduced confusion by mingling error with truth.
   Erroneous ideas regarding social relationships and marriage
are just as damaging to emotional and spiritual growth as are
erroneous interpretations of Bible doctrine.
  What insights regarding human relationships have you
found valuable in your search for success and happiness?
What negative attitudes have you discarded?

GOD'S IDEAL DISTORTED

   What other institution shares a common origin with mar-
riage? Gen. 2:1-3. How important is it to us today? Matt. 24:20.


   "Jesus pointed His hearers back to the marriage institution as
ordained at creation. . . . He referred them to the blessed days of
Eden, when God pronounced all things 'very good.' Then mar-
riage and the Sabbath had their origin, twin institutions for the
glory of God in the benefit of humanity."—Thoughts From the
Mount of Blessing, p. 63.

  Compare the Sabbath and marriage both in their purpose
and in the ways they have suffered under sin:

                           Sabbath            Marriage

   God's ideal distorted. Desecration of the Sabbath parallels
the desecration of marriage. Revival of true Sabbathkeeping
will be accompanied by revival of Christian marriage.
   Devaluation of women. In pagan cultures, and even among
the people of God, women were often regarded as property.
Easy divorce for men, polygamy, and treatment of women as
inferiors corrupted God's plan.
   Violations of the marriage covenant: adultery (2 Sam. 11:2,
4), incest (Eze. 22:9-11), rape (2 Sam. 13:14), bestiality (Lev.
18:23), homosexuality (Rom. 1:26, 27), prostitution (Judges 16:1),
polygamy (2 Sam. 5:13), divorce, violence, and abuse (Mal. 2:16;
Matt. 19:8).
   Sexual renunciation or permissiveness. Throughout the
Middle Ages celibacy and virginity were thought more holy
than marriage. This view is still held, though it is contrary to
Scripture. (See Heb. 13:4.) By contrast, today sexual pleasure is
often divorced from true love within marriage.

LESSONS FROM A LOVING COUPLE

   As we have already discovered, Song 4:16-5:1 are the focal
point of the book. One hundred eleven lines of Hebrew text
precede 4:16 and 111 lines follow 5:1. These delicately worded
verses, shrouded in symbols, represent the consummation of
Solomon and Shulamith's marriage relationship. Song 4:1-15
likewise belongs to this private time. The ceremony (Song 3:11)
concluded, the couple take delight in each other.

   How do the words of Song 4:1-7 convey Solomon's love for
his bride? What truths about married love do they serve to
convey?


   Though the meanings of these several compliments may be
somewhat obscure to us, the groom's comparisons are to things
familiar and enjoyable to them both.
   The Song of Solomon presents the personal, physical aspects
of married love as a source of enjoyment like the rest of crea-
tion. (See Prov. 5:18, 19; Gen. 26:8.) Scripture knows nothing of
the artificial, pagan separation between mankind's physical and
spiritual natures, nor the aversion to the joy of wedded love
that appears in the writings of some church fathers.

   In what way is Solomon's superlative compliment in Song
4:7 a commentary on true love?


   Blessed is the couple who, when they discover the im-
perfections that were camouflaged by early romance, can still
say, "There is no flaw in you" (Song 4:7, RSV). God's gift of
selfless love, dispensed by His Spirit (Rom. 5:5), sustains ro-
mance and friendship. "There is no flaw in you" becomes a
commentary on the lover as much as on the one loved. True
love cloaks imperfections and deeply values the person.
   Christ "is the Bridegroom; the bride is the church, of which,
as His chosen one, He says, 'Thou art all fair, my love; there is
no spot in thee.' Canticles 4.7       Ephesians 5:25-28."—The
Ministry of Healing, p. 356.

   What is the wisdom in focusing upon the good qualities of
a spouse, a relative, or a friend? How can we confront
attitudes and behaviors injurious to our relationships and still
be loving?
                                                              65

THE BIBLICAL VIEW OF LOVE

  What is the relationship between the invitation "Come
with me from Lebanon" (Song 4:8) and the comparisons to
Lebanon of Song 4:11, 15?


   Solomon enjoyed Lebanon, using its timber extensively
(1 Kings 4:33; 5:6) and placing buildings there (1 Kings 9:19).
Probably these verses imply that this is where he found
Shulamith. His pleasure with this region's scenic grandeur (Song
4:8), the fresh fragrance of its vegetation and forests (verse 11), the
refreshment of its waters (verse 15) describe her charms.

   How does the attitude shown by each spouse in the Song
reflect their commitment to the gospel principles referred to
in these texts?

     1 Cor. 7:1-5

     Phil. 2:3, 4 (compare 1 Thess. 4:3-5)

   Solomon invites his wife, "Come with me" (Song 4:8). She
responds with an invitation of her own, "Let my beloved come
into his garden" (Song 4:16). He responds (Song 5:1). This
invitation-response pattern illuminates the nature of true love.
There is no force or manipulation. The response of Shulamith is
the best evidence of the atmosphere of loving freedom that ex-
ists. Into this relationship she freely and lovingly enters. "My
garden" is "his garden" (Song 4:16).
   "Neither party has the right to deny the other the intimate
privileges of the marriage relation. . . . Each has a claim to
conjugal rights; always, however, with the divine qualification
that God is to be honored in all things."—SDA Bible Commen-
tary, vol. 6, pp. 706, 707.
   A loving spirit. "Let each of you look not only to his own
interests, but also to the interests of others" (Phil. 2:4, RSV). This
principle should lead each to promote the other's comfort,
pleasure, and satisfaction. Neither should push the other be-
yond that with which he or she is physically, emotionally, or
spiritually comfortable. As married partners study "to advance
the happiness of each other," there will be "mutual love, mu-
tual forbearance"—The Ministry of Healing, p. 360. "In all the
deportment of one who possesses true love, the grace of God
will be shown."—The Adventist Home, p. 50.

OUR LOVE RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD

   How does Scripture commonly describe the marital union?
Gen. 4:1 (compare 1 Sam. 1:19; Luke 1:34; Matt. 1:24, 25). How
does this deepen understanding of married love as symbolic
of the union between the believer and God? Eph. 5:31, 32.


   "Know is the term used in the Bible to define our relationship
to God; it also is the term used to designate the intimate union of
husband and wife."—Ed Wheat, Intended for Pleasure (Grand
Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan Publishing House, 1980), p. 22. In this
"knowing," the most hidden inner depths of their beings surface
and are offered by each to the other. For the discerning Christian,
such a unique and tender knowledge provides insight into the
most holy mystery, the union of Christ and the church.

  What do these passages indicate regarding our privilege of
knowing the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit?

  Jer. 9:24

   Hosea 6:3

  John 16:13-15

   John 17:3

   2 Peter 1:2

   "In a knowledge of God all true knowledge and real devel-
opment have their source. Wherever we turn, in the physical,
the mental, or the spiritual realm; in whatever we behold, apart
from the blight of sin, this knowledge is revealed. Whatever line
of investigation we pursue, with a sincere purpose to arrive at
truth, we are brought in touch with the unseen, mighty Intelli-
gence that is working in and through all. The mind of man is
brought into communion with the mind of God, the finite with
the Infinite. The effect of such communion on body and mind
and soul is beyond estimate."—Education, p. 14.

   Consider why the Scriptures use the physical, mental, and
spiritual relationship between a husband and wife as an
illustration of the believer's relationship with God. What spe-
cific features of the two relationships are similar?
                                                                 67
Friday                                       November 27
FURTHER STUDY: How does Paul's discussion of the
believer's fellowship with Christ (Romans 8) relate to the fellow-
ship between husband and wife that is encouraged in other pas-
sages of Scripture? Read "Marital Duties and Privileges" in The
Adventist Home, pp. 121-128. If you have access to it, read SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 6, pp. 705-708, 1038.

   "Religion is needed in the home. Only this can prevent the
grievous wrongs which so often embitter married life. Only
where Christ reigns can there be deep, true, unselfish love. Then
soul will be knit with soul, and the two lives will blend in har-
mony. Angels of God will be guests in the home, and their holy
vigils will hallow the marriage chamber. Debasing sensuality
will be banished. Upward to God will the thoughts be directed; to
Him will the heart's devotion ascend.
   "In every family where Christ abides, a tender interest and
love will be manifested for one another; not a spasmodic love
expressed only in fond caresses, but a love that is deep and
abiding."—The Adventist Home, p. 94.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Why is verbal communication between husband and wife
     important as a means of reinforcing their love relation-
     ship?

     2. Why do some married couples cease to express love for
        each other by kindly words and deeds? How can the joy
        of first love be restored?

     3. Think about and share the following with your spouse:
        a. Things that are very good about our relationship.
        b. Things that are fairly good, but where some im-
           provements could be made.
        c. Things I can do to improve our relationship.

     4. In what sense is it true that wrong attitudes about mar-
        riage and sexuality are an homage we pay to the god of
        this world? Why must a true Sabbath revival be accompa-
        nied by an equal effort to recover marriage as God in-
        tended it?

SUMMARY: God honors the conjugal relationship as an en-
riching part of human life. The physical, intellectual, and spir-
itual relationship between husband and wife represent the
believer's relationship with Christ.

             Dreams




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S LESSON: Song 3:1-5; 5:2-6:3.
  MEMORY TEXT: "His speech is most sweet, and he is al-
  together desirable. This is my beloved and this is my
  friend" (Song 5:16, RSV).
  KEY THOUGHT: Even in close relationships disagreements
and differences are inevitable, but God's wisdom and power
enable us to surmount the barriers that tend to separate us. He
equips us for building intimate friendships and families.
    WE CAN OVERCOME THE BARRIERS TO BONDING. In
the Song of Solomon, the delights of marriage, as well as some of
its difficulties, are revealed. On either side of the happy scenes of
Solomon and Shulamith's wedding day are episodes that con-
trast sharply, displaying elements of conflict, stress, and a sense
of separation. These verses help us to face our own close relation-
ships honestly. We discover that, by the wisdom and grace of
God, we can surmount the barriers to our bonding with others.
    Differences in personality and approach to life's challenges
need not necessarily result in irreconcilable conflict. Persons
who are somewhat set in their attitudes and behavior can
gain new insights and develop new methods of interacting
with others as they allow their friends or spouses to influ-
ence them.
                                                                  69

REVEALING DREAMS

   Describe the events recorded in Song 3:1-4; 5:2-7. What
similarities do you find? What contrasts?


   Feelings of separation. In these episodes, Shulamith longs to
be with Solomon, but feels separated from him. In Song 3:1-5,
no reasons are given for her concern over the separation. The
anxiety of her search, which is futile at first, is relieved when
she finds her husband shortly after meeting the watchmen.
   In Song 5:2-8, Shulamith refuses the late-night approach of
Solomon. Finally deciding to let him in, she finds that he is
gone. A search similar to that of the earlier episode takes place,
this time without success.

     What evidence indicates that these episodes are dreams?


   The two episodes are perhaps best understood as dreams:
   1. Nighttime incidents. (Compare references to night, sleep, ris-
ing from bed in 3:1, 2; 5:2, 5). "To sleep while the heart wakes
[Song 5:21 signifies to dream, for sleep and distinct consciousness
cannot be co-existent; the movements of thought either remain in
obscurity or are projected as dreams."—Franz Delitzsch, Com-
mentary on the Song of Songs, p. 91.
   2. Emotionally charged, recurring scenes with abrupt endings. In
each incident Shulamith experiences:
      a. a sense of the loss of her beloved (3:1; 5:6).
      b. frantic, futile searching (3:1; 5:6).
      c. encounters with the watchmen (3:3; 5:7).
      d. anxiety and pain. Though the first episode ends with
         the finding of the beloved, even this is not without
         anxiety. She "held" (literally "seized") him and
         "would not let him go" (Song 3:4). The second episode
         ends abruptly after the violence of Song 5:7.
   3. Shifts in setting are common in dreams. In the earlier experi-
ence she is first in her bedroom (palace), then in the city streets
and squares (Jerusalem), then in her mother's bedroom (Leba-
non). The second episode contains scenes inside and outside her
bedroom, then in the city streets.
   4. Events inconceivable in real life. It is unlikely that the queen
would be searching the city for the king, that she would be
alone on the streets at night, or that she would be attacked by
her subjects in the manner described.

A RECORD OF EMOTIONAL PAIN

  Compare other scriptural references to individuals with
nighttime experiences of emotional tension and troubled rest
upon their beds:

  Esther 6:1

  Ps. 6:6, 7
  Dan. 2:1

  Dan. 6:18

   Concern or anxiety about relationships often disturbs sleep
or causes dreaming. Scripture speaks of individuals being emo-
tionally tense, restless, and troubled upon their beds. A heart
and mind at peace can truly sleep (Ps. 4:8). While prophetic
revelations are sometimes given in dreams (Daniel 2), usually
dreams play back, like an emotional record, the important
wishes, fears, concerns, and worries of the dreamer.
   Shulamith's dreams hint at vague feelings of concern about
her future with Solomon, which give rise to strong feelings
within her. She has a sense of distance between herself and her
husband.
  What feelings do you think Shulamith could have been
experiencing in her marriage to Solomon? What feelings
might her husband have had? Check from the following list,
and add other feelings that may be appropriate. Put "M" for
him, "F" for her, or "MF" when both have the same feeling:

    hurt jealous           _ manipulated                 lonely
    anxious   offended        frustrated                  angry
    rejected  vindictive      indifferent                 afraid
    resentful disappointed    misunderstood

  Explain why you chose these feelings.

   How does your experience reveal that close relationships
have their moments of ecstasy and delight as well as moments
of pain and anxiety? How do relationship matters affect your
ability to concentrate in the daytime or to sleep at night? What
have you found helpful to enable you to deal with your concerns?

                                                             71

DIVINE PURPOSES FOR MARRIAGE

   For what great causes was marriage ordained by God? Gen.
1:28; 2:18.


   Perpetuation of the human family and also provision for
human love, affection, and companionship are outlined in Gen-
esis as God's purposes for marriage.
   "God made from the man a woman, to be a companion and
helpmeet for him, to be one with him, to cheer, encourage, and
bless him, he in his turn to be her strong helper. All who enter
into matrimonial relations with a holy purpose—the husband to
obtain the pure affections of a woman's heart, the wife to soften
and improve her husband's character and give it complete-
ness—fulfill God's purpose for them. . . .
   "He ordained that men and women should be united in holy
wedlock, to rear families whose members, crowned with honor,
should be recognized as members of the family above."—The
Adventist Home, p. 99.
   The call of the gospel is to a shared life in marriage, to mu-
tual love, belonging, caring, acceptance, and service.

   What barriers to meaningful relationships lie within us?
What is needed to remove these barriers? Study the following
passages as they may apply to marriage and other interpersonal
relationships: Isa. 59:2; Jer. 17:9; Matt. 19:8; Rom. 7:15-25; 8:1-14.


   Scripture points to the heart as the source of difficulty in rela-
tionships between us as human beings, as well as between us and
God. Heart "generally denotes the seat of various attitudes, emo-
tions, and of intelligence."—SDA Bible Dictionary, p. 447. Our
hearts govern our attitudes, our behaviors, and our relationships
with others. If deep in our hearts, for example, there is a sense of
worthlessness, we may unconsciously act this out by with-
drawal, by hiding our feelings, by a lack of communication, or by
fighting, blaming, or seeking to control or manipulate others. Our
most pressing need is to allow the Holy Spirit to direct every
attitude and behavior. "Hearts that are filled with the love of
Christ can never get very far apart."—The Adventist Home, p. 94.

   As you examine your heart, what barriers to mutually ben-
eficial relationships with friends and loved ones have you
erected? How do you plan to remove these barriers?

DIFFICULTIES WITH DIFFERENCES

   Our differences tend to pose barriers to all our close relation-
ships. "We differ so widely in disposition, habits, and education,
that our ways of looking at things vary. We judge differently. Our
understanding of truth, our ideas in regard to the conduct of life,
are not in all respects the same. There are not two whose experi-
ence is alike in every particular. The trials of one are not the trials
of another. The duties that one finds light, are to another most dif-
ficult and perplexing."—Gospel Workers, p. 473.
   The way we deal with our differences determines the quality
of our marriages, our families, and our other friendships. To ac-
cept differences with understanding and a willingness on the
part of both individuals to make adjustments results in progres-
sive growth toward deep and lasting relationships. Otherwise,
differences cause disagreement. Disagreements can result in ex-
pressions of anger and conflict. Unresolved anger and conflict
can lead to a giving up in the struggle for happiness, followed by
resentment, bitterness, rebellion, and alienation. Or there may be
endless disputing, which is never settled. Some may work out a
form of agreement by the capitulation of one of the partners to the
other, thus giving up his or her own personality. Or withdrawal
may occur, with each person organizing his own life and becom-
ing more and more secretive. (See Paul Tournier, To Understand
Each Other [Richmond, Virginia: John Knox Press, 19671, p. 32.)

   How did differences in spouses affect the following bibli-
cal marriages? What conflicts were present? What evidences
of anger and irritation were there? What resolutions were
reached?
   Rebekah and Isaac (Gen. 24:15-26, 66, 67; 27:1-46):


   Hannah and Elkanah (1 Sam. 1:1-2:11, 20, 21):


   Michal and David (1 Sam. 18:20-28; 2 Sam. 6:16-23):


   Why would it be good for couples contemplating marriage
to compare the ways they are alike or different? Suppose one
partner needs to change, but cannot or will not. What attitude
should the other partner adopt? Should there be a limit to
tolerance? (See 1 Cor. 7:10, 11.)

                                                                    73

BECOMING ONE WHEN TWO ARE SO DIFFERENT

   In what promise may we place our trust when we face dif-
ficulties in our relationships? Phil. 4:19.


   Do not harbor negative thoughts. "Though difficulties, per-
plexities, and discouragements may arise, let neither husband
nor wife harbor the thought that their union is a mistake or a
disappointment. Determine to be all that it is possible to be to
each other."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 360.
   God's choice is best. "A strong sense of common purpose, a
conviction amid all other uncertainties that their destinies are in-
tertwined, can provide the Christian married couple with an in-
domitable will to toil together for the fulfillment of the dreams
they dreamed together when they took their vows at the altar.
They can rest content in the assurance that because their choice of
each other was not theirs alone, their life together is enriched by
the divine blessing."—David and Vera Mace, In the Presence of
God (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1985), p. 70.
   Varied temperaments can relate. "Marked diversities of dis-
position and character frequently exist in the same family, for it is
in the order of God that persons of varied temperament should
associate together. When this is the case, each member of the
household should sacredly regard the feelings and respect the
right of the others. By this means mutual consideration and for-
bearance will be cultivated, prejudices will be softened, and
rough points of character smoothed. Harmony may be secured,
and the blending of the varied temperaments may be a benefit to
each."—Child Guidance, p. 205.

     How does Shulamith describe her husband? Song 5:10, 16.


   "Tell the people of Him who is 'the Chiefest among ten thou-
sand,' and the One 'altogether lovely.' The Song of Solomon
5:10, 16. Words alone cannot tell it. Let it be reflected in the
character and manifested in the life. Christ is sitting for His
portrait in every disciple."—The Desire of Ages, p. 827.

   In what ways are differences evident between you and
your spouse, children, or others to whom you would like to be
closer? How can you use these differences to build stronger

FURTHER STUDY: What shall we do with anger in relation-
ships? Study these references: Gen. 30:2; Ps. 4:4; 85:3, 5; 103:8;
Prov. 15:1; 16:32; Matt. 5:22; Mark 3:5; Eph. 4:26, 27, 31; Col. 3:8.
   What attitude lies at the heart of Christian relationships?
Eph. 4:32 (compare Eph. 1:7; 1 Peter 2:23, 24; Rom. 12:17, 19).
   Read "A Happy, Successful Partnership," "Mutual Obli-
gations" and "A Sacred Circle" in The Adventist Home, pp. 105-
120, 177-180.
   "It is true there is an indignation that is justifiable, even in the
followers of Christ. When they see that God is dishonored, and
His service brought into disrepute, when they see the innocent
oppressed, a righteous indignation stirs the soul. Such anger,
born of sensitive morals, is not a sin. But those who at any sup-
posed provocation feel at liberty to indulge anger or resentment
are opening the heart to Satan. Bitterness and animosity must be
banished from the soul if we would be in harmony with
heaven."—The Desire of Ages, p. 310.
   "By getting behind the anger to the hurt feeling that has
triggered it, the couple can learn something important about
their relationship and clear it up. This is one of the most valu-
able ways in which relationships grow."—David and Vera
Mace, In the Presence of God, p. 58.
DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Think about and share the following with your spouse or
     close friend:
     a. Times when your forgiveness has meant much.
     b. Areas where forgiveness is needed in our relationship
        to make way for new beginnings.
   2. Can you tell of a situation in which, when someone for-
      gave you, your attitude changed and you were able to
      establish a renewed friendship with that person?
SUMMARY: The Song of Solomon describes Shulamith's
dreams, which dramatized her fears regarding her relationship
with her husband. When differences between friends or mar-
ried couples result in division and broken friendship, by God's
grace it is possible to study each other's points of view and to
be sensitive to each other's feelings. When differences of tem-
perament are understood, they can result in more effective
bonding.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Thou art beautiful, 0 my love, as
     Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with
     banners" (Song 6:4).

   KEY THOUGHT: The nurture of marriage maintains strong
bonds and guards against inappropriate relationships. As the
heavenly Bridegroom, Christ inspires His bride, the church, to
be faithful amid the challenges of the last days.

   THE JOY OF MARRIAGE. In 1891 Hudson Taylor published
sermons on the Song of Solomon. Prefacing a reprinted edition of
this book, J. A. Motyer observes: The Song of Songs "is rarely, if
ever, taken in to the contemporary pulpit, and present-day Chris-
tians, on the whole, seem to view the song with nervousness, if
not with suspicion. And, to be frank, there is good reason for this,
for the song alludes with plainness and delight to areas of human
experience where modem fashions, at least among Christians,
dictate reticence, and where the devil has achieved something of
a take-over bid."—Hudson Taylor, Union and Communion (Lon-
don: China Inland Mission, 1891), p. vi.
   Song, screen, and printed page today portray the joys, pleas-
ures, and excitement of what is called love, but rarely in mar-
riage. It is time to reclaim for marriage its profound joy.

MARRIAGE IN DANGER

   Read 2 Timothy 3:1-7. In what ways are the characteristics
of life in the last days contrary to God's plan for:

  Friendship
  Marriage

  Family life

  Sexuality

   Why is it significant that, following his counsel on mar-
riage and family living (Eph. 5:21-6:4), the apostle Paul draws
upon military metaphors and uses the language of battle to
describe the Christian experience? Eph. 6:10-12. What are the
"wiles of the devil" as far as marriage is concerned? How can
his assaults be resisted?


   Studied strategies against marriage. "It was Satan's studied
effort to pervert the marriage institution, to weaken its obliga-
tions and lessen its sacredness; for in no surer way could he de-
face the image of God in man and open the door to misery and
vice."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 338. "The enemy has great
power over minds that are not thoroughly fortified by prayer and
established in Bible truth."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 292.
   That many marriages are miserable is demonstrated by sta-
tistics on marital violence and escalating divorce rates. Reports
from many who remain married tell of conflicts, romance-
robbing frustrations, and wide-scale unhappiness.

   How does the commandment "You shall not commit
adultery" (Ex. 20:14, RSV) reveal the danger to which mar-
riage is exposed in our fallen world? To what sinful tenden-
cies of the human heart does this commandment point? Matt.
5:28; 1 Cor. 7:7, 9 (compare Titus 2:12; 1 Peter 2:11).


   Susceptibility to unauthorized relationships. The seventh
commandment, when obeyed by Christ's grace, protects the
sanctity of marriage and the home. It applies to the whole range
of sexual morals. It acknowledges the lustful tendencies within
us because of sin and warns against yielding to them.
                                                              77

WARNING SIGNALS

   How do the Proverbs of Solomon warn us about dangers for
marriage? What does Proverbs 5 say about immorality? How do
the references to the woman's lips and voice (verse 3), to walk-
ing with her, visiting her house (verse 8), being embraced in her
arms (verses 20-23), seek to discourage immoral bonding? What
consequences follow adultery? 1 Thess. 4:1-8; Heb. 13:4.


   "Fidelity to the marriage vow is good sense and infidelity is
folly, even if there were no judgment and no afterlife. But there is
an afterlife, and entrance to it is dependent upon a willingness to
be cleansed from all defilement. The adulterer meets a double
condemnation. He loses the true joys of this life and is barred
from the greater and more enduring joys of the life to come (Prov.
15:3; Mal. 3:5; Heb. 13:4)."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 964.
   Early warning signals. Our human weaknesses provide no
excuse for sin. We must be aware of situations in which we are
vulnerable. It causes us to be more earnest in maintaining faith-
fulness and integrity. An adulterous relationship can steal up on
anyone who ignores the warning signals. Insight into ourselves
should cause us to call upon Christ for grace. (See Prov. 5:21.)
   Times when individuals are particularly vulnerable to in-
appropriate bonding include:
   • When one is working apart from one's spouse.
   • When one is experiencing grief or loss or is in special need
       of affirmation.
   • When one is sharing spiritual or emotional topics on a
       deep personal level.
   The complex physiological and psychological laws that gov-
ern human pair-bonding operate similarly whether a relation-
ship is appropriate or illicit. When an extraordinary comfort, an
exceptional inner delight, an electric excitement results from
seeing a person, from hearing the other's voice, or from touch-
ing or being touched, the initial stages of the bonding sequence
are under way. An urge for privacy with him or her, anticipa-
tion of closer contact, or desire for more intimate communica-
tion signals deeper involvement. Daydreaming or night
dreaming about the person confirms the growing bond.

  What means do you use to restrain yourself when you become
aware of any of the signs listed above? (See 1 John 5:1-5, 18.)

THE DIVINE PRESCRIPTION

   What example of faithfulness and integrity did Joseph pro-
vide? What special pressures were upon him as a single per-
son? What firm and decisive steps did he take to avoid
forming an inappropriate relationship? Gen. 39:7-20.


   "Under the inspecting eye of God and holy angels many take
liberties of which they would not be guilty in the presence of
their fellow men, but Joseph's first thought was of God. 'How
can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?' he said."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 217.

   Considering the Mosaic law's death penalty for adultery
(Lev. 20:10), why was Christ's forgiveness of the woman taken
in adultery significant? John 8:1-11. In what way does the
spirit of forgiveness look beyond the actual offense to treat
the individual's inner sense of shame?


   Divine pardon available. "In His act of pardoning this
woman and encouraging her to live a better life, the character of
Jesus shines forth in the beauty of perfect righteousness. While
He does not palliate sin, nor lessen the sense of guilt, He seeks
not to condemn, but to save. The world had for the erring
woman only contempt and scorn; but Jesus speaks words of
comfort and hope. The Sinless One pities the weakness of the
sinner, and reaches to her a helping hand. . . . Men hate the
sinner, while they love the sin. Christ hates the sin, but loves the
sinner. This will be the spirit of all who follow Him. Christian
love is slow to censure, quick to discern penitence, ready to
forgive, to encourage, to set the wanderer in the path of holi-
ness, and to stay his feet therein."—The Desire of Ages, p. 462.

   How is the statement "Keep the windows of the soul
closed earthward and opened heavenward" (The Adventist
Home, p. 96) good advice in avoiding inappropriate relation-
ships? In fulfilling this counsel, what is the special value of
counseling, guidance, and support from trained professionals
when a marriage is in danger? How might the lessons Jesus
taught in forgiving the adulterous woman help us in relating
to those who have committed similar offenses? Why is for-
giving of a guilty marriage partner so important—even when
the marital relationship is no longer viable?
                                                                 79

NURTURE FOR A TENDER PLANT

  What positive counsel does Solomon give about strength-
ening marriage? Prov. 5:15-19. How does this compare with
the themes within the Song of Solomon?


   "Home is to be the center of the purest and most elevated
affection. . . . The plant of love must be carefully nourished, else
it will die."—The Adventist Home, pp. 195, 196.
   "Drink from your own well." This passage (Prov. 5:15-19) is
a strong affirmation of marriage and the directive to cultivate
love with one's spouse. Here Scripture likens the union of a
husband and wife to a wellspring of water which refreshes the
hearts of both. (Compare Song 4:15.) "A man's love for his wife
should be a strong affection that enters into every facet of life. It
should be—in a good sense—an obsession, so that nothing is
thought or done without being affected by the thought of the
one who shares the life. In this sense love is an inebriation. The
word for 'ravished' [Prov. 5:19] may literally mean 'intoxi-
cated.' "—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 964.

   Discover new comparisons made by Solomon. What com-
pliments are repeated? Why? Song 6:4-10.


   Love for a lifetime. "To gain a proper understanding of the
marriage relation is the work of a lifetime. Those who marry enter
a school from which they are never in this life to be graduated.
   "However carefully and wisely marriage may have been en-
tered into, few couples are completely united when the marriage
ceremony is performed. The real union of the two in wedlock is
the work of the afteryears."—The Adventist Home, p. 105.
   Maintaining a healthy marriage requires regular repetition of
the steps in bonding—admiring each other, talking, touching,
playing, laughing, listening, worshiping together, compliment-
ing each other's special qualities and talents, accepting each
other's limitations, sharing each other's deepest joys and fears.

   In what ways does Christian love and commitment make a
difference, even in a marriage with less than ideal circum-
stances? What new compliment could you give today to your
friend, your spouse, your child, or other relative?

RECAPTURING EDEN

   What additional comparisons highlight Shulamith's bear-
ing and character? Song 6:10.


  This description applies to both Shulamith and the pure
bride of Christ. "Beauty and strength are here combined in a
description that has appropriately been applied to the
church."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1121.
  "Clad in the armor of Christ's righteousness, the church is to
enter upon her final conflict. 'Fair as the moon, clear as the sun,
and terrible as an army with banners' (Song of Solomon 6:10),
she is to go forth into all the world, conquering and to con-
quer."—Prophets and Kings, p. 725.

   How does Song 7:1-10 endorse the physical aspects of mar-
ried love? (Compare Gen. 26:7-9; 29:17-20; Prov. 5:19.)


    Reminiscent of Eden. Solomon's delight in Shulamith is an-
other crescendo in the Song. In their marriage, the deepest
levels of bonding are open to them. And in these, they both take
delight. With joy and wonder the wife exclaims, "I am my
beloved's, and his desire is for me" (Song 7:10, RSV). The whole
passage indicates a marital relationship reminiscent of Eden.
    Love is not lust. "Love is a pure and holy principle, but
lustful passion will not admit of restraint and will not be dic-
tated to or controlled by reason. It is blind to consequences; it
will not reason from cause to effect." "It is carrying that which
is lawful to excess that makes it a grievous sin."—The Adventist
Home, pp. 123, 124, 122.
    Love's emotions a gift of the Creator. "It was our Creator
who gifted us with the capacity for the intense and passionate
emotions required to fall in love. Clearly, God intended for our
emotional potential to be fully developed in marriage and to
find its fulfillment in oneness with our beloved. . . .
    "Infatuation demands and takes; love delights in giving. . . .
In real love, your reason, instructed by biblical concepts, guides
your emotions and shapes your relationship according to God's
wisdom."—Ed Wheat, Love Life (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zon-
dervan, 1980), pp. 94, 95.

  1. For true love to be recaptured, what change must take
     place at the center of one's life? Gal. 2:20; John 3:16-21.

     2. Evaluate your ability at rekindling affection and love:
        a. Have I renewed my commitment to my spouse/friend?
        b. Does my partner feel loved?
        c. Do I care for my personal appearance?
        d. Do I offer honest compliments often?
        e. Am I imaginative and creative?

SUMMARY: The Lord designs that pure marriage between a
man and a woman should be a source of spiritual, emotional,
and physical blessing to them both, and a source of blessing to
their loved ones, friends, neighbors, and the society in which
they live.

Passing on Love's Torch




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S LESSON: Song 7:11-8:14.

   MEMORY TEXT: "Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a
seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death" (Song 8:6).

   KEY THOUGHT: A happy home life increases the likelihood
that children will experience wholesome emotional develop-
ment, relate well to others, and make their parents' values their
own.

   CHILDHOOD HOME LIFE PREPARES FOR MARRIAGE.
Perhaps no influence is more telling upon children's present
and future emotional well-being than the quality of their rela-
tionship with their parents. For this reason, though the Song of
Solomon is not about children, its theme—the joy to be found in
marriage—is profoundly important to children.
   The hero and heroine of the Song were once children them-
selves. Like all couples, the hero and heroine of the Song brought
to their union what they had learned at home about themselves,
about human relationships, and about love. In the final sections
of the Song are found several references to Shulamith's home,
mother, childhood, and youth. In a unique way, these verses
reach back to the years of childhood, showing the influence of the
parental home on marriage.
                                                               83

A HEART TURNED TOWARD HOME

  What invitation and proposal does Shulamith make to her
husband? Song 7:11-13.


   "In this section the bride expresses her longing for her home
in Lebanon."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1122.

  What makes Shulamith want to go home? What memories
does she have? Who else is in her mind? Song 7:12-8:2.


  Fond memories of home. Happy memories of a childhood
home and its natural surroundings flood Shulamith's mind.
Their early romance took place there. This section parallels
Solomon's courtship visit to her home (Song 2:8-12).
Shulamith's memory of home includes thoughts of her mother.
Thinking of the high moral standards her mother impressed
upon her, Shulamith seems to reminisce of a time early in her
acquaintance with the king. She wishes now for them to go
back to her home as husband and wife.

  What does Scripture teach regarding the important role of
parents in their children's lives? Prov. 1:8; Isa. 66:13; Eph. 6:4.


   What responsibilities do children have toward their par-
ents? Ex. 20:12; Eph. 6:1-3; Col. 3:20, 21.


   Mutual responsibilities of parents and children. Children
are a gift from God (Ps. 127:3). They are the "younger members
of God's family" (The Adventist Home, p. 161). To find Christ, to
trust Him, to be reborn in Him, to grow in Him, and to follow
Him is a journey that God has not left children to make alone.
As God is a parent to us, so earthly parents are to provide for,
train, and correct their children. They too are to be adopted into
the heavenly family.
   "Parents are entitled to a degree of love and respect which is
due to no other person. . . . The fifth commandment requires
children not only to yield respect, submission, and obedience to
their parents, but also to give them love and tenderness, to
lighten their cares, to guard their reputation, and to succor and
comfort them in old age."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 308.

"TRAIN UP A CHILD"
   How can the gospel enable a home to be the happiest place
on earth, a foretaste of our home in heaven? John 15:12; 1 John
4:7-11.

   The nucleus of the home is the relationship of the parents. If
Christ's love has made their marriage fragrant, its aroma will
permeate the whole family.
   "Mutual affection between husband and wife will be to the
family what the heating system is to a house. It will maintain the
relationship of all family members in a pleasant and comfortable
atmosphere. That does not mean, however, that the peace of the
family will never be disturbed. . . . It is not the absence of prob-
lems that marks the truly happy family, but the confident assur-
ance that relationships in the home are basically so sound that
family members can deal with any problems which may arise."
—David and Vera Mace, In the Presence of God (Philadelphia:
Westminster Press, 1985), p. 109.
  What valuable counsel on transmitting values to our chil-
dren is found in Proverbs 22:6?

   Children need to be trained. Because children do not natu-
rally follow after Christian values, they should be lovingly
trained. There is a need for firmness. But in God's plan firmness
is always paired with kindness. Parents need "a firm, steady
hand and a kindness which convinces the child of your love."—
Child Guidance, p. 283. (See also p. 264 and The Ministry of Heal-
ing, p. 391.)
   Parents should seek to create a thirst for the things of God,
making His ways so attractive that children will seek after them
as eagerly as a newborn turns to its mother's breast. It is vital
for parents to model Christian values consistently in their own
lives. Kindly but firmly they should correct their children's mis-
behavior, at the same time encouraging them to ask questions.
The goal is to encourage children to accept Christ's way.
  How does one balance "leaving" father and mother
(Gen. 2:24) with "honoring" them (Ex. 20:12)? In what sense
does the directive to "leave" obligate parents to release
their adult children to live their own lives? What can par-
ents do to maintain a relationship with their children?
                                                                 85

MAKE DISCIPLES

   How did Jesus describe a "disciple"? John 8:31; 13:35. In
what way is the family an important setting for carrying out
Jesus' directive to make disciples? Matt. 28:19.


   The most important mission field. "As workers for God,
our work is to begin with those nearest. It is to begin in our own
home. There is no more important missionary field than
this."—Child Guidance, p. 476.
   Christian families are natural settings for teaching Christian
truth. Parents should use God's Word in teaching values and
lifestyle. Since children first learn about relationships in the
family, the Christian family possesses a remarkable potential
for teaching about God's love and the Christian manner of re-
lating to others (John 13:35).
   "It [the family] is a place where disciplelike relational skills
are learned, and it is a primary group in which disciple making
takes place."—Dennis Guernsey, A New Design for Family Minis-
try (Elgin, Ill.: David C. Cook Publishing Co., 1982), p. 11.

about issues related to love, intimacy, and sexuality. Parents
were to take the time to teach their children (Deut. 6:6-9).

TEACHING CHILDREN ABOUT LOVE, INTIMACY, AND
SEXUALITY
   Joseph's experience indicates that his parents were able to
share such topics with their children. "The early impressions
made upon his mind garrisoned his heart in the hour of fierce
temptation and led him to exclaim, 'How can I do this great
wickedness, and sin against God [Gen. 39:9]?' "—Child Guid-
ance, p. 197.
   Establish a loving home climate. The love of their parents
for them and for each other is a primary source of instruction
for children about love, intimacy, and sexuality.
   Communicate the positive biblical message. The parents'
comfort with the subject of intimacy and sexuality determines the
quality and effectiveness of their guidance. Positive, balanced
scriptural views must replace misunderstandings, myths, and
folklore.
    Early parent-child bonding, through cuddling babies with
our hands, eyes, voices, and mouths, sends positive signals,
which give feelings of security and trust and lays a good founda-
tion for life's later bonding experiences. Anxiety, displeasure,
and punishment because of small children's exploration of their
bodies or because of inadequate progress with control of body
functions may create lasting feelings of unpleasantness and may
engender a sense of confusion or shame.
    Supply children with correct information. "The children
need to be instructed in regard to their own bodies. There are
but few youth who have any definite knowledge of the myster-
ies of human life. They know but little about the living ma-
chinery."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 536.
    Be alert for natural opportunities to talk to children. Answer
questions simply and to the point. Information, unfolding with
 the child's developmental and vocabulary levels, will include:
correct terminology for body parts and functions, differences
 between boys' and girls' bodies, the role of father and mother in
 reproduction, appropriate and inappropriate touch of private
 body parts, an understanding of physical and emotional matu-
 ration in girls and boys, the process of friendship bonding and
 male-female pair bonding, responsible and irresponsible sexual
 behavior, social and emotional problems related to sex, the
 meaning of love and intimacy in marriage, principles of family
 planning and parenting, and the importance of wholesome sex-
 ual attitudes.


                                                               87

"CALL HER BLESSED"

   The final verses of the Song of Solomon reveal several of
Shulamith's character qualities. Presented in the context of a
visit to her home, the implication is that these values came from
her upbringing.

  What request of Solomon does Shulamith make? What
depth of understanding about love does she reveal? Song 8:6, 7.


   "True love is a high and holy principle, altogether different in
character from that love which is awakened by impulse and
which suddenly dies when severely tested. It is by faithfulness to
duty in the parental home that the youth are to prepare them-
selves for homes of their own. Let them here practice self-denial
and manifest kindness, courtesy, and Christian sympathy. Thus
love will be kept warm in the heart, and he who goes out from
such a household to stand at the head of a family of his own will
know how to promote the happiness of her whom he has chosen
as a companion for life."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 176.

   What indicates that Shulamith believed in premarital chas-
tity? What was her brothers' attitude? Song 8:8-10.


   She recalls these words from her childhood, when her
brothers were concerned about maintaining her purity until
marriage. "Brothers played a major role in the sister's courtship
and marriage (Gen. 24:29, 50, 55, 60), and in the protection of
her chastity (Gen. 34:6-17; 2 Sam. 13:20, 32)."—Marvin Pope,
The Anchor Bible: Song of Songs (New York: Doubleday, 1977), p.
678. They speak of her attitudes and behavior, using the figures
of a "wall" and a "door"—barriers to forbidden modes of con-
duct. The brothers will endeavor to protect her.
   In verse 10, no doubt is left about which of the comparisons
describes her. Both before and within marriage, she has decided
to keep herself only for the one with whom she makes a lifelong
covenant. This is a state of peace, restfulness, and contentment.

  How can parents, guardians, relatives, teachers, and friends
best involve themselves in the process of adolescent develop-
ment and yet allow the adolescent the freedom to grow?

  5. Why is it important to make every effort to present educa-
     tion regarding close relationships and sexuality within the
     context of the Christian message? How can the parents
     best fulfill their responsibility for their children's educa-
     tion in this regard? What is the role of the pastor, church,
     and school in augmenting the education given at home?
SUMMARY: We are not alone in the tasks of rearing children
and making them disciples. The Holy Spirit and heavenly an-
gels work with us. "As God puts this fearful responsibility into
our hands, at the same time he encompasses us about once
more with a marvelous mercy. He works in the lives of our
children. . . . We may not be adequate to bring up our chil-
dren, but God always is, and he never deserts them or forgets
about them or leaves them out of his sight. Trusting that guid-
ance, believing that God will use even our mistakes with our
children, we parents have the courage to continue in our stew-
ardship."—Elizabeth Achtemeier, The Committed Marriage
(Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1976), p. 197.

Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S LESSON: Song 8:6, 7.
     MEMORY TEXT: "Many waters cannot quench love, nor
     can the floods drown it. If a man would give for love all
     the wealth of his house, it would be utterly despised"
     (Song 8:7, NKJV).
   KEY THOUGHT: The love of God is fully revealed in Christ.
Such love refines, elevates, and gives endurance to our human
love in our families and friendships.
   THE FINAL MOVEMENT in Solomon's magnificent song
presents the loftiest of thoughts about love. True love is price-
less and permanent, declares his beloved in her soliloquy. Its
flame is not extinguished by floods, its value unapproached by
earthly fortunes.
   Eloquence of this kind might appear to be but an exaggera-
tion by an anxious wife seeking a deep commitment from a
man for whom other beauties wait in the wings. But this is no
mere overstatement. This love of which she speaks will provide
a lasting union of husband and wife. This love reaches out to
grasp the galaxies. This is the eternal, boundless love of God
being portrayed.

REVELATIONS OF GOD'S LOVE
  List the qualities of love as portrayed in Song 8:6, 7.

   "Pure love is such that nothing can destroy it. It cannot be
bought. The highest offer would be completely scorned. This
passage, telling of the invincible might and enduring constancy
of true love, stands without a parallel in literature for forceful-
ness of expression."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1123.
   What experiences of love on the human level enable us to
glimpse the depth of God's love? Consider the love of Solo-
mon and Shulamith as an illustration: Song 2:16; 4:7; 8:2 (com-
pare Psalm 32; 2 Sam. 18:33). What are the limitations of
human love?

   Earthly ties reveal God's love. "God has bound our hearts to
Him by unnumbered tokens in heaven and in earth. Through
the things of nature, and the deepest and tenderest earthly ties
that human hearts can know, He has sought to reveal Himself
to us."—Steps to Christ, p. 10.
   "Properly and ultimately there can be no separating chasm
between love divine and love human; and because of this fact
the marriage bond became, both in the Old Testament and the
New Testament, the symbol of the divine love."—The
Interpreter's Bible, vol. 5, p. 102.
   Special revelation necessary. Though human love and di-
vine love are one seamless piece, yet because of sin, revelations
of God through human lives and relationships "but imperfectly
represent His love." A special revelation is necessary. "The Son
of God came from heaven to make manifest the Father. . . . Only
He who knew the height and depth of the love of God could
make it manifest."—Steps to Christ, pp. 10, 11, 14.
  Do you agree with the following statement? "A person's
image of God is often patterned after his image of his own
parents, especially his father. If his parents were happy, lov-
ing, accepting, and forgiving, he finds it easier to experience a
positive and satisfying relationship with God. . . . If his par-
ents were hard to please, he usually has the nagging notion
that God is not very happy with him either."—Richard
Strauss, How to Raise Confident Children (Grand Rapids,
Baker Book House, 1975), pp. 23, 24.
                                                                 91

ONE WHO KEPT ON LOVING

   Consider the following glimpses into the character of the
disciple John: Mark 3:17; 10:35-41; Luke 9:49, 51-54. How
would you describe him as a person? What do you think it
would be like to have a close relationship with him?


   A most unlovable young man. "All the disciples had serious
faults when Jesus called them to His service. Even John, who
came into closest association with the meek and lowly One, was
not himself naturally meek and yielding. He and his brother were
called 'the sons of thunder.' While they were with Jesus, any
slight shown to Him aroused their indignation and combative-
ness. Evil temper, revenge, the spirit of criticism, were all in the
beloved disciple. He was proud, and ambitious to be first in the
kingdom of God. But day by day, in contrast with his own violent
spirit, he beheld the tenderness and forbearance of Jesus."—The
Desire of Ages, p. 295.

   In what special ways did Jesus show unconditional love to
John? Mark 9:2-8; 14:32-42; John 19:25-27.


   How the Son of God changed the son of thunder. A tough
exterior, more often than not, covers an interior that is insecure.
Jesus looked beyond the coarse exterior to provide that for
which John's heart craved—true love, acceptance, and a sense
of value. Four times the apostle records in his gospel that Jesus
kept on loving him (John 13:23; 19:26; 20:2; 21:7). Jesus drew
John into the inner circle of the disciples, showed him His glory
on the Mount of Transfiguration, and invited him to Gethsem-
ane, where He solicited John's prayer support at a most vulner-
able period in His life. In His dying moments on the cross, Jesus
turned over the care of His own mother to John. What accep-
tance of His disciple, what love and trust, what confidence in
his ability to change through love's awesome power! These
powerful portrayals of love touched John's heart.

   Would you be willing to testify to your Sabbath School
class how the love of Jesus has changed your life? What dif-
ference has His love made in your relationship with your
spouse? in your relationships with other family members?
with your work associates? with fellow church members?
with those who treat you as an enemy?

GOD'S LOVE IN THE WRITINGS OF JOHN

   What concepts regarding God's love are found in the writ-
ings of John?


   a. Love's source—God's love for us. 1 John 4:9, 10, 19. At the
cross John beheld the embodiment of love crucified for him—
Jesus, the Lamb of God, the atonement for our sins (1 John 4:10).
On the cross Jesus became sin for John, became his Substitute,
taking his untamed spirit, his hasty temper, his prejudice, his
thirst for power and revenge. From that cross flowed redemp-
tive, transforming love for John and for us. On the cross hung,
as it were, the son of thunder (Mark 3:17), that at the foot of the
cross John might be, by grace, a son of God (1 John 3:2).

   b. Love's command—love one another. John 13:34; 15:12;
1 John 4:11. John records the words of Jesus, "Love one another;
as I have loved you" (John 15:12). Here is a Christian imperative.
But it is intimately tied to and follows the love of God showered
upon us. Because of the security we feel in Christ's love, we are
able to love God and others, our spouses, our children, even those
who are unlovely. The human love of Christians is anchored in
the unchangeable fact that God loves us.
   Human love ebbs and flows like the tide. But even when the
tide of our affections is out, leaving exposed the ugly mudflats
of a dull or painful relationship, just beyond there is always the
vast, unchanging ocean of divine love from which we can draw.

   c. Love's essence—it gives. John 3:16; 15:13; 1 John 3:16. The
essential nature of God's love is to forsake all systems of fear
and power familiar to this world (1 John 4:18) and give itself in
service for the needs of others. Love sometimes suffers, endures
pain, and sacrifices itself for others.

   d. Love's extent—it is permanent. John 13:1. God's love is
not temporary. It is vastly different from the kind of love that is
awakened by passion and dies suddenly when severely tested.
It is tough, durable, resilient. It is love that can outlast the
storm. This love endures because it is equipped to deal with
obstacles that stand in the way. It is able to forgive and to
provide for new beginnings. (See John 15:12.)

  Is your love for your spouse and others unselfish and en-
during?
                                                                 93
Wednesday                                     December 23
MAKING LOVE A MINISTRY
   In what ways does the gospel call us to engage in a minis-
try of loving others? Rom. 12:6-15.


    "Our sympathies are to overflow the boundaries of self and
the enclosure of family walls. There are precious opportunities
for those who will make their homes a blessing to others. Social
influence is a wonderful power. We can use it if we will as a means
of helping those about us."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 354.
    "Go to your neighbors one by one, and come close to them
till their hearts are warmed by your unselfish interest and love.
Sympathize with them, pray with them, watch for opportu-
nities to do them good, and as you can, gather a few together
and open the Word of God to their darkened minds."—Welfare
Ministry, p. 64.
  Who are some of the people for whom we are especially to
minister? What are the unique needs of each?

Acts 9:36-39                 James 1:27

Matt. 11:5                   Lev. 19:34

   How will a ministry of love seek to restore those who have
fallen into sin? Gal. 6:1, 2.


   "The love that is inspired by the love we have for Jesus will see
in every soul, rich and poor, a value that cannot be measured by
human estimate. . . . This is the spirit that should be encouraged
to live in every heart and be revealed in every life. This love can
only exist and be kept refined, holy, pure, and elevated through
the love in the soul for Jesus Christ, nourished by daily commu-
nion with God. All this coldness on the part of Christians is a de-
nial of the faith. But this spirit will melt away before the bright
beams of Christ's love in the follower of Christ. Willingly, natu-
rally, he will obey the injunction, 'Love one another as I have
loved you.' "—Welfare Ministry, p. 83.

   Despite the needs of others, why is it important to put first
the needs for love in one's marriage and family? How might
church discipline be made more redemptive by patterning it
after the corrective love shown to children at home?

IN PRAISE OF LOVE
  Why does our communion with the Lord and our praise of
Him, like our communion with and affirmation of another
person, have the effect of strengthening our love? Ps. 42:1, 2;
116:1, 12-19; 2 Cor. 3:18.

   The law of praise. By beholding, we are changed. As we seek
to discover the good qualities and affirm them in the other per-
son, they become more strongly imprinted on our minds. We
form a bond with that person. In our spiritual lives a similar re-
sponse takes place. As we dwell upon the attributes of our Lord,
we are attracted to Him. We feel closer to Him.
   "It is not the fear of punishment, or the hope of everlasting
reward, that leads the disciples of Christ to follow Him. They
behold the Saviour's matchless love, revealed throughout His
pilgrimage on earth, from the manger of Bethlehem to Calvary's
cross, and the sight of Him attracts, it softens and subdues the
soul. Love awakens in the heart of the beholders. They hear His
voice, and they follow Him."—The Desire of Ages, p. 480.
   What exclamation does the love of God in Christ call forth
from the apostle Paul? 2 Cor. 9:15.

   How did these individuals express their love for God?
   Jesus' mother Mary (Luke 1:46-55)
   Simeon (Luke 2:28-32)
   Mary (Luke 7:37, 38)
   The healed demoniac (Mark 5:18-20)
   Monuments of love. Love will find a way to praise and re-
spond to its loved one, in lofty language or stuttering syllables,
with achievements grand, or with simple, earnest acts of devo-
tion. The Taj Mahal, that world-famous domed mausoleum of
white marble in India, stands as a monument of the love of the
Mogul emperor Shah Jahan for his beloved wife. Long before
Shah Jahan, King Solomon and his Shulamite queen loved each
other. The Song of Solomon is a literary monument called forth
from his heart by the love they shared.
                                                               95
Friday                                        December 25
FURTHER STUDY: Read "The Divine Shepherd" and
"Calvary" in The Desire of Ages, pp. 476-484; 741-757. What in-
dication is there that life in the new earth will revolve around
praise of God's love? Rev. 5:8-14.

   "The years of eternity, as they roll, will bring richer and still
more glorious revelations of God and of Christ. As knowledge
is progressive, so will love, reverence, and happiness increase.
The more men learn of God, the greater will be their admiration
of His character. . . . From the minutest atom to the greatest
world, all things, animate and inanimate, in their unshadowed
beauty and perfect joy, declare that God is love."—The Great
Controversy, p. 678.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. As the Song of Solomon is to the Old Testament, 1 Corin-
     thians 13 is to the New Testament. For a devotional exer-
     cise read 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 in a modern version and
     place Jesus in place of the word love. Then personalize
     these verses by placing your name in place of the word
     love. Discuss with your spouse or close friend your experi-
     ence with this devotional exercise. What insights did you
     receive? What personal growth is needed? What changes
     need to be made?

     2. What is the evidence of my devotion to those I claim to
        love and care about?
     • What "monuments" am I leaving behind that will declare
        my love for God? for my family? for my church? for hu-
        manity?
     • Jesus said, "Freely you have received, freely give" (Matt.
        10:8, NIV). In what tangible ways have I expressed this
        week to those who love me, my gratitude for Christ's
        priceless gift? How can I offer God's gift of unconditional
        love to someone who needs it today?

SUMMARY: The Song of Solomon is a magnificent poetic de-
scription of the spiritual, emotional, and physical bonds be-
tween a husband and wife. The principles that guided their
relationship before and after marriage are a rich source of di-
rection in our relationships today. Married and unmarried per-
sons are directed by the Word of God to find in Christ the love
and grace to form human bonds that will be satisfyingly close,
mutually rewarding, and eternally binding.

        Lessons for First Quarter, 1993
  Sabbath School members who have not received a copy of the
adult Sabbath School lessons for the first quarter of 1993 will be
helped by the following outline in studying the first two lessons.
The title of the series is Look Up and Live. This quarter's lessons
are on the topic of healthful living.

First Lesson: Why Be Healthy?
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Genesis 1-3; Rom. 3:23-28;
Eze. 36:25-27; Mark 5:25-34; James 2:17-26.
MEMORY TEXT: "I will restore health unto thee, and I will
heal thee of thy wounds, saith the Lord" (Jeremiah 30:17).

  KEY THOUGHT: Good health is the result of obeying God's
natural and moral laws. The gospel of Christ frees us from habits
that endanger our health and gives us the power to develop a
healthy lifestyle.


Second Lesson: "None of These Diseases"
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ex. 6:7; Lev. 11:43-45; 1 Cor.
6:19, 20; 10:31; 1 John 3:2, 3.

MEMORY TEXT: "If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice
of the Lord thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight,
. . . and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases
upon thee; for I am the Lord that healeth thee" (Exodus 15:26).

   KEY THOUGHT: Because the plan of salvation includes our
restoration to health (Lesson 1), the Bible shows us our part in

WHY SHOULD KIDS
HAVE ALL THE FUN?
  Why is it that the wonder and excitement we feel as children
at the fascinating stories of the Bible, somehow fade as we
"mature" into adulthood? Don't the stories of David, Job, and
Jonah still have something to say about the problems we face
every day?
  Bible Stories for Small Groups, by Michael L. Leno, blends
the thrilling, yet practical stories of Scripture with the relational
dynamics of small group ministry. The result is 24 Bible lessons
designed to help you and your small group discover God in a
way you may not have imagined possible.
  So stop letting the kids have all the fun. Open your Bible, this
exciting study guide, and your heart to group members in sincere
Christian fellowship, and brace yourself for the time of your life.
