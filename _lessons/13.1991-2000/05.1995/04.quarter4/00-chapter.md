               Incarnation of Grace
                         Christ Has Come

    In life the anticipation of an event often exceeds the reality we
experience when the event itself occurs. We wait, hope, and plan for
the coming event. When the time arrives, we are sometimes disap-
pointed because the actuality falls short of our expectation.
    God's people had long looked for the coming Messiah. Prophets
spoke of His coming, and the longer they had to wait, the more
distorted was their concept of the Messiah's mission. No amount of
anticipation or planning adequately prepared God's people for the
reality of the event. The incarnation of God in human flesh far ex-
ceeded in significance anything for which most people had hoped.
    The simple, yet profound, words of Matthew are inadequate to
express fully the meaning of Jesus' first advent. " 'The virgin will be
with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel'—
which means 'God with us' " (Matt. 1:23, NIV). "God with us." What
could this possibly mean?
    To a people burdened with foreign oppression, it meant a mighty
king who would free them from the yoke of bondage. To those af-
flicted with disease, it pointed toward healing and health. To the
religious leaders, it meant a Messiah who would fulfill their political
ambitions.
    How different, and yet how much more significant, the coming of
the Messiah proved to be! The King was born in a stable, and He later
stated, "My kingdom is not of this world" (John 18:36). Those looking
 for physical healing often found in Him relief from their burden of sin.
 As the political expectations of the religious elite were dashed, they
 found themselves plotting the destruction of the One who declared
 Himself to be "God with us."
     How different are we today? Are we still looking for a God who
 will fulfill our expectations? Are we anticipating the blessings God
 will bring without understanding the true nature of dedication to the
 Jesus we claim to serve?
     The promise of "God with us" is just as certain today as it was in
 the days of Mary, Joseph, the shepherds, and the wise men. When
 Jesus left this earth, He promised, "I will be with you always, to the
 very end of the age" (Matt. 28:20, NIV).
     How important for us to gain a clearer understanding of Jesus'
 mission, to study the prophetic timetable of His coming, and to catch a
 glimpse of the wonder that filled the lives of those who were present at
 His first advent. Then we can come away from this quarter's study
 with our faith renewed and filled with awe at the lovingkindness and
 compassion of God, who left heaven to live with humans and to
  redeem us from the penalty and burden of sin.
                                                                        5

           The Time for Grace




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Rom. 3:9-18; 5:15-21; Heb.
4:14-16; John 1:14-17.

    MEMORY TEXT: "For it is by grace you have been saved,
    through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of
    God—not by works, so that no one can boast" (Ephesians 2:8,
    9, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Considering all the New Testament instances
of the term grace, we can define it as God's infinite love for lost
humanity and all that His love leads Him to do for our salvation.

   GRACE INCARNATE. Throughout this world's history, God's
grace has been evident. He has consistently rescued from sin those
who have committed their lives to Him. God's grace is not only His
earnest desire to save lost humanity but also His saving power mani-
fested in loving conviction for all and actual deliverance for those
who believe.
    The greatest revelation of God's grace was in the coming of Jesus
to this world. Through Him, we have a clear and undeniable testimony
of God's love for sinners. The sinless, perfect One died on the cross
for sinners. During His life on earth, He demonstrated God's grace in
His attitude toward sinners. He healed them physically and restored
them spiritually. God's infinite love put on flesh and blood in the
person of Jesus Christ—the incarnation of grace. As you study this
quarter's lessons, look for evidence of Christ's love and forgive-
ness—His grace—in the daily events of your life.

WHAT IS GRACE? (2 Cor. 8:9).

  What do the following texts reveal about the source and pur-
pose of divine grace?

2 Cor. 8:9


Titus 2:11


Acts 20:32


   God's grace "is His unlimited, all-inclusive, transforming love
toward sinful men and women."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6,
p. 504.
   "We ourselves owe everything to God's free grace. Grace in the
covenant ordained our adoption. Grace in the Saviour effected our
redemption, our regeneration, and our exaltation to heirship with
Christ."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 250.

    List four or five characteristics of God's grace revealed by the
father in the story of the prodigal son. Luke 15:11-32.




   The father showed constant vigilance toward the son who was lost.
His acceptance of the returning son was not based upon the son's
worthiness or merit but upon his own unconditional love. The father
welcomed him, not as a servant, but as a son with all the benefits of
sonship.
   Even though the older son remained at home, he did not understand
his father's character. But the father extended his grace to him by
explaining that true service is a loving response to the love that has
been offered.

   How did you feel about God when you first recognized His
 grace toward you?

                                                                     7
Monday                                                October 2
WHY WE NEED GRACE (Rom. 3:9-18).

    Describe the condition of all people. Rom. 3:9-18.


   When we remember that righteousness is the condition for entrance
into God's kingdom (Matt. 25:46), it is obvious that apart from Christ
none would enter. God's grace is most evident in His supplying
humanity's lack.

   How did God reveal His grace toward humanity? Rom. 5:8, 15-
21.


   In these verses, Paul contrasts the effect of Adam's offense and the
effect of God's grace as shown through Jesus Christ. Whereas the sin
of one led to condemnation and death for all, so the grace of God
abounds for all and brings justification and life for "those who re-
ceive" (Rom. 5:17, RSV).
   "Christ did not die to appease His Father or to induce Him to love
us. It was divine love that conceived the plan of atonement and
salvation in the beginning, and the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit have
all worked together in perfect harmony to effect it (see John 3:16;
10:30; 14:16, 26; 15:26; 17:11, 22, 23; Rom. 3:24 . . .)."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 6, p. 527.

    How can we reconcile such love with God's wrath? God's wrath
is against sin and against those who identify themselves with it. If an
individual chooses to remain in sin, separated from God, that person
will experience God's wrath against sin. But through His grace, in
Jesus Christ, God extends the gift of salvation to all.
    Jesus' interaction with the woman caught in adultery teaches
us a great deal about God's grace toward sinners. (See John 8:1-
11.) "In His act of pardoning this woman and encouraging her to live a
better life, the character of Jesus shines forth in the beauty of perfect
righteousness. While He does not palliate sin, nor lessen the sense of
guilt, He seeks not to condemn, but to save. The world had for this
erring woman only contempt and scorn; but Jesus speaks words of
comfort and hope. The Sinless One pities the weakness of the sinner,
and reaches to her a helping hand."—The Desire of Ages, p. 462.

    How does this story give you hope? What does the manner in
 which Jesus treats you, a sinner, indicate how you should treat
 others?

JESUS—GOD'S REVELATION OF GRACE (John 1:14-18).

    "When the fullness of the time had come, the Deity was glorified
by pouring upon the world a flood of healing grace that was never to
be obstructed or withdrawn till the plan of salvation should be ful-
filled."—The Desire of Ages, p. 37.

  How does John describe the role of Jesus in revealing God's
grace? John 1:14-18.


   God's people had lost sight of His gracious character. Jesus Christ
came so humanity might regain an understanding of God's grace
toward sinners. And this grace He manifested toward us. There is no
end to our need of God's grace and no end to His supply.
   Jesus revealed God's grace throughout His life and ministry on
earth. But the greatest revelation of grace was His death upon the
cross (Rom. 5:8). On the cross Jesus demonstrated the deadly nature
of sin. And in addition, He showed us the vastness of His love. Instead
of leaving us under the penalty of death, Jesus took that penalty upon
Himself. He bore our sin with its guilt and penalty of death—eternal
separation from the Father.

   Tell in your own words what Jesus says is the greatest demon-
stration of love toward another. John 15:12, 13.


   Even this demonstration does not equal Jesus' sacrifice. He gave
His life for us before we became His friends, "while we were yet
sinners" (Rom. 5:8). In John 15, He reminds us that we can share
God's grace with others through our willingness to show sacrificial
love.
   "Sometimes we live as if we were sent into the world to compete with
one another, or to dispute with one another, or even to quarrel with one
another. But the Christian is to live in such a way that he shows what is
meant by loving his fellow men. It is here [John 15:12, 13] that Jesus
makes another of his great claims. . . . Many a man tells men to love each
other, when his whole life is a demonstration that that is the last thing he
does himself. Jesus gave men a commandment which he had himself first
fulfilled."—William Barclay, The Gospel of John (Philadelphia: Westminster
Press, 1975), vol. 2, p. 177.

    In what ways can you share the grace of God with others
 through sacrificial love?


                                                                           9

THE RESULTS OF GRACE (Eph. 2:4-7).

   Realizing our sinfulness prepares us to understand God's grace
because we recognize that there is nothing we can do to merit His
favor. God takes the initiative in every aspect of salvation, and we
respond in faith. The incarnation of Jesus provides evidence of the
lengths to which God is willing to go in order to save us. The provi-
sions He made did not end with His forgiveness of sin. He gives us
new life and a new future.

     How does Paul describe our position in Christ? Eph. 2:4-7.


   When we accept by faith God's provisions for our salvation, we are
"in Christ" and share His holiness (1 Peter 1:1, 2). "We are crucified
with Him, we die with Him, we rise with Him, we live with Him, we
reign with Him, we are joint heirs with Him, we suffer with Him, we
share His glory."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1007.

     What privilege do we have in times of need? Heb. 4:14-16.


   Because of Christ we can approach God with confidence. "We
come boldly, not because God is indebted to us, but because God
freely offers His grace to all who seek it."—SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 7, p. 426.
   Christ "can laugh and weep with us about life's foibles and pain
because He has been through it all, yet without falling before any of it.
Because we know that such a Priest and Prince is on the throne of
grace disbursing favor far beyond what we deserve, we can approach
without fear or cowering, walking erect and receiving whatever re-
sources we need to live life victoriously, overcoming every obstacle."
—Louis H. Evans, Jr., The Communicator's Commentary: Hebrews
(Waco, Tex.: Word Books, 1985), p. 105.

  Describe how the conversion of the apostle Paul shows God's
grace in action. Acts 9:1-19; 1 Cor. 15:8-10.


   How would you describe the practical effects of God's grace
 operating in your life?
   When have you reached out to God with boldness in time of
 need? How did you experience His grace during that time? Did
 His grace change your circumstances, or did it change you?

OUR RESPONSE TO GRACE (Eph. 2:8-10).

   God takes the initiative in offering salvation. But He does not force
any of us to accept its provisions. For His salvation to be ours, we
must reach out in faith and accept the benefits of Jesus' life, death,
resurrection, and heavenly mediation.

  Summarize the relationship of our faith to God's grace in sal-
vation. Eph. 2:8-10.


   "If you believe the promise—believe that you are forgiven and
cleansed—God supplies the fact."—Steps to Christ, p. 51. The practi-
cal result is conformity to God's will (Rom. 8:1-4).
   The story of the healing of the centurion's servant demon-
strates the nature of saving faith. Read Matthew 8:5-13. This centu-
rion is remarkable for at least two reasons: (1) Evidently he was well
aware of a Jewish law mandating that no Jew could enter a Gentile's
house (verse 8); all such houses were regarded as "unclean." Yet he
knew enough about Jesus to believe He could help him. (2) The
centurion's concern for his servant was uncommon, considering that
slaves had no rights and were usually treated as mere possessions.
   The centurion's "heart had been touched by the grace of Christ. He
saw his own unworthiness; yet he feared not to ask help. . . . His faith
took hold upon Christ in His true character. He did not believe in Him
merely as a worker of miracles, but as the friend and Saviour of
mankind."—The Desire of Ages, p. 317.
   Christ's offer of salvation is based upon His grace, not upon our
worthiness. When we respond in faith, the gift is ours.

   How will those who have experienced the grace of God in their
lives respond to others? 1 Peter 4:8-10.


   Charles Spurgeon once stated, "I have heard our Lord compared to a
man carrying a waterpot. As he bore it upon his shoulder, the water,
yielding to the movement of his body, fell dropping and spilling about so
that one could easily track the water-bearer. So should all of God's
people be carrying such a fullness of grace that everyone knows where
they have been by the tracks they leave behind."

    How has God transformed you into a channel for His grace?




                                                                       11
Friday                                                 October 6
FURTHER STUDY: Read Matthew 26:31-35; 69-75; John 21:15-19.
How does Peter's experience illustrate the experience described in
this week's memory verse?
   Read "Transformed by Grace" in The Acts of the Apostles, chapter
55, pp. 557-567. How did the changes in John's life come about? How
does God want to work in your life to bring about your transforma-
tion?

   "Put away the suspicion that God's promises are not meant for you.
They are for every repentant transgressor. Strength and grace have
been provided through Christ to be brought by ministering angels to
every believing soul. None are so sinful that they cannot find strength,
purity, and righteousness in Jesus, who died for them. He is waiting to
strip them of their garments stained and polluted with sin, and to put
upon them the white robes of righteousness; He bids them live and not
die."—Steps to Christ, pp. 52, 53.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
   Do you agree with the following statements about God's grace?
 Why or why not? How would you improve each statement?

     1. God's grace is available to anyone who desires it.

     2. I need God's grace only when I first accept Jesus as my
        Saviour.

     3. If God's grace is at work in my life, my friends and family
        will see positive changes in me.

     4. God is gracious toward me because of my need.

SUMMARY: "Grace is a great word in the Bible. . . . It is most simply
defined in these words—it is favour shown to people who do not
deserve any favour at all. And the message of the gospel is that any
one of us is saved and put right for eternity, solely and entirely by the
grace of God, not by ourselves."—D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones, The Cross
(Westchester, Ill.: Crossway Books, 1986), p. 74.
   We do not deserve God's grace, nor can we repay Him for the gift.
He bestows His grace by pardoning and cleansing all who are willing.
And no matter how desperate our condition, God's grace is always
greater (Rom. 5:20). Thanks be to God for the gift of Jesus Christ, the
incarnation of grace.

            Mother should have been happy. She had five healthy children,
        including little Baby Shamim. But sometimes Noreen noticed
        tears on her mother's face. "What is the matter?" she wondered.
        But her mother kept her fears and her questions to herself.
            Then one day Mother gathered the children to her and said
        quietly, "I must go to my parents. Be good children. I love you."
        With that Mother left their little home. The children waited and
        longed for Mother's return, but Mother did not come back. When
        little Shamim cried inconsolably, Noreen rocked her and whis-
        pered, "I love you, Kaaki [little sister]."
            As Shamim grew Noreen was like a mother to her. But one day
        while on her way to school, Shamim was stuck by a taxi. The car
        ran over her leg. When Shamim awoke in great pain, Noreen
        stood beside her. "Lie still, Shamim. Your leg is broken. But it
        will soon heal and you will be fine."
            When Shamim's leg swelled badly, She tried not to cry, for she
        did not want to disappoint Noreen. Then one day, just as her leg
        was healing, a hammer fell from a shelf and hit the same bone that
        had been broken. Shamim's screams brought Noreen rushing to
        her side. She found her little sister holding her swollen leg! Poor
        child, Noreen thought as she tended her sister. If only Mother
         were here. She would know what to do.
            Shamim was badly injured and required surgery. She was thankful
         to the doctors and nurses who cared for her, but even seven
        surgeries could not correct the problem. Shamim could not walk.
        Tears threatened to break through her brave exterior.
            "Don't cry little Shamim," Noreen comforted. There is a God
         who cares for you. He loves you even more than I love you.
         Surely He will care for you."
            Shamim's eyes grew wide. She had never heard her sister talk
         like that. "Noreen, who told you about a God who cares for us?"
            " I heard a pastor in the hospital tell someone that Jesus loves
         and cares for little children."
            Shamim thought for a minute. "So there is a God who loves me.
         Then I need not worry, for He will care for me." Comforted,
         Shamim prepared herself for still another surgery on her leg.

                 A Messiah
            Is Promised (Part I)




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Peter 1:10-12; Isa. 9:2-7;
11:1-5; 40:3-5; 42:1-4.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Concerning this salvation, the prophets,
     who spoke of the grace that was to come to you, searched
     intently and with the greatest care" (1 Peter 1:10, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: When the time had come for the Messiah to arrive,
Isaiah's prophecies confirmed that Jesus was the fulfillment of the sinner's
hope.

   THE GRACE THAT WAS TO COME UNTO YOU. It is easy to
make predictions about the future, but more difficult to be accurate in
every detail. When studying the prophecies regarding the coming of the
Messiah, we notice many detailed predictions. And as we study the next
two lessons, we will discover how each prediction was fulfilled. Realizing
how Jesus' birth, life, and death fulfilled these predictions strengthens our
confidence in the accuracy of God's Word.
   The prophecies of Isaiah reveal a Messiah who would meet our need
for salvation from sin. And what a salvation it is! "Even angels long to
look into these things" (1 Peter 1:12, NIV). "The angels have great
acquaintance with God, yet apparently they discern the greatest revela-
tion of him here. . . . The angels have wonderful faculties of insight, yet
there is more here than they can fathom. Such is the fulness of the gospel
that they are still far from comprehending it."—The Pulpit Commentary,
vol. 22, p. 48.
   In viewing the life of Jesus, it becomes evident that He fulfilled the
hope that the Messiah would come. Have you allowed yourself to be
touched by His grace?

PROPHECIES REVEAL CHRIST (1 Peter 1:10-12).

   As early as God's promise to Adam and Eve, humanity has looked
forward to the Saviour. God said: "And I will put enmity between you and
the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he shall bruise you on the
head, and you shall bruise him on the heel" (Gen. 3:15, NASB). This
prophecy pointed forward to the One who would break the power of Satan.
As time passed, through His prophets, God continued to provide messages
of hope in the coming Redeemer.

  What do the following texts reveal about the purpose of these
prophecies?

1 Peter 1:10-12


Luke 24:25-27, 44, 45


   Even though the prophets did not fully understand the messages they
conveyed, they did know God's promise that the coming Messiah would
deal with sin and Satan.
   The prophets' messages were to bring assurance that Jesus was the
long-awaited Messiah. By comparing His life with the prophecies con-
cerning the Messiah's birth, death, and mission, we can know that these
prophecies reached their fulfillment in Jesus.

   What should be our focus as we study the Scriptures? John 5:39,
40.


   Jesus' warning to the Jews of His day is important for us also. If we are
looking only for doctrine or prophetic timetables, we will miss the central
message of the Bible. We must see Jesus.
   The eyes of faith. "It was ancient Jewish thought that a knowledge of
the law would itself assure a man of eternal life. Thus Hillel, a rabbi of the
1st century B.C., is reported to have declared: 'One who has acquired unto
himself words of Torah, has acquired for himself the life of the world to
come' . . . . Had the Jews searched the Scriptures with eyes of faith, they
would have been prepared to recognize the Messiah when He stood among
them."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 955.

    Be honest with yourself as you complete the following sen-
 tence: "I study the Bible so I can ..."

THE PROMISED CHILD (Isa. 9:2-7).

   A need for light. When Isaiah wrote the words of Isaiah 9:1-7, the
armies of Assyria dominated the lands of Zebulun and Naphtali, two of
Israel's northernmost tribes. It was a time "full of dimness" and affliction.
Certainly the people desired light in the midst of their darkness (Isa. 9:2).
Before the first coming of Christ, spiritual darkness covered the earth.
People desperately needed the Messianic message of light and hope.
Isaiah's prophecy of the coming Christ child provided the assurance that
God would reverse the misfortunes of His people.

   Summarize the benefits the Messiah would bring to His people.
Isa. 9:2-5.


   How frightening it is to be in darkness with no hope of light. And yet
God promised that light would come in the midst of the darkness experi-
enced by the people.

   How do the following texts show the fulfillment of this prophecy in
the life of Jesus?


John 1:4-9


John 8:12


John 9:5


    The coming Messiah would fill many roles. (See Isa. 9:6, 7.) He
would be a ruler. Yet the characteristics of His rule would be of a spiritual
nature. He would exhibit the compassion of a counselor and all the
attributes of the mighty God. He also would replace Adam as the new,
eternal Father of the human race. And He would bring peace resulting
from the breaking of the penalty and power of sin. The Messiah's
kingdom would outlast all earthly kingdoms (Dan. 2:44). It would be full
of justice and righteousness and would bring hope and eternal blessing to
believers. Only the life and ministry of Jesus fulfilled all these promises.

     How has Jesus brought "light" out of the "darkness" in your
 life?

A WORK OF PREPARATION (Isa. 40:3-5).

    Isaiah declares that before the "glory of the Lord" (Isa. 40:5, NW) is
revealed, a work of preparation is to be done. "The voice of him that crieth
in the wilderness" (Isa. 40:3) is to precede the coming of the Messiah.

   Describe the type of work to be done by the one who was preparing
the way. Isa. 40:3-5.


    The writers of the Gospels identify this "voice" from the wilderness as
that of John the Baptist. (See Matt. 3:3; Mark 1:2-4; Luke 3:4-6; John
1:23.)
    Preparing for the king. "When an Oriental monarch intended to visit
parts of his realm he would dispatch messengers to each district to be
visited, announcing his anticipated visit and summoning the inhabitants to
prepare for his arrival. The local inhabitants of each district were expected
to 'prepare' the highway over which he would travel, inasmuch as little
was ordinarily done to maintain roads."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5,
p. 296.

  How did the work of John provide spiritual preparation for the
ministry of Jesus? Luke 1:76-79; 3:3-18.


   "Every mountain and hill made low" (Luke 3:5, NIV). "The work
here described is an apt illustration of the transformation of character that
accompanies genuine conversion. The high places of human pride and
power were to be cast down."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 717.
   "John was to go forth as Jehovah's messenger, to bring to men the light
of God. He must give a new direction to their thoughts. He must impress
them with the holiness of God's requirements, and their need of His
perfect righteousness."—The Desire of Ages, p. 100.
   God never leaves His people without a message of preparation for
His coming. Just as God called John the Baptist to prepare the people for
the first advent of Jesus, so God calls us to prepare the world for the second
coming of Jesus. Our responsibility is to share with others the joy of
salvation and the power of God to forgive and cleanse the life from sin.

    What similarities do you see between the message of John the
 Baptist and the distinctive end-time message of Seventh-day
 Adventists? List ways you can involve yourself in preparing
 others for the second coming of Jesus.

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MESSIAH (Isa. 11:1-5).

   What did God promise would come from the "stump of Jesse"?
Isa. 11:1, NIV.


    When it appeared that all that was left of the seed of Jesse was a stump
or root, God promised to bring forth a new shoot that would bring life and
vitality to God's plans.

   How do the following texts contribute to our understanding that
this "branch" is Jesus?

Jer. 23:5, 6


Rev. 5:5; 22:16


Acts 13:22, 23


    Isaiah 11:2-5 provides us with a beautiful picture of the nature and
character of the mission of the Messiah. The Spirit of the Lord would
rest upon Him (Isa. 11:2). This was fulfilled in the life of Jesus at His
baptism. (See Matt. 3:16, 17; Acts 10:38.)
    We witness Jesus' wisdom, understanding, counsel, and knowledge as
He interacted with people. He often pointed to the importance of His
dependence upon His father, His "fear of the Lord." And unlike other
religious leaders of His day, He did not base His judgment of people upon
outward appearances but upon their hearts and motives.
    With righteousness as His standard, He fairly judged all, bringing life
and salvation to those who accept His righteousness and predicting judg-
ment and death for those who trust in their own righteousness.
   "The judges were corrupt, taking advantage of the poor and the unfor-
tunate, and the rich were grinding down widows and orphans (Isa. 1:23;
10:1, 2; Jer. 5:28; Amos 2:6; 4:1; 5:10, 11; 8:4-6; Zech. 7:10). The spirit of
the promised Messiah was in striking contrast with the spirit of the times.
Justice, equity, mercy, and a sympathetic consideration for the needs of
the poor and downtrodden are the principles constantly set forth as charac-
terizing the ideal king."--SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 158.

THE MISSION OF THE MESSIAH (Isa. 42:1).

   List several things the following texts reveal about Jesus' mission.
Isa. 42:1-7, 14-16, 21.


   Jesus' compassion. Prominent in Jesus' mission is His compassion
and tenderness toward those bruised and damaged by sin. Matthew applies
these verses to Jesus (Matt. 12:15-21) immediately after relating that Jesus
healed the man with a withered hand and many others who followed Him.
Then Matthew describes Jesus' healing the blind man who could not speak
and who was possessed by a demon.
    Many stories in the Gospels reveal Jesus' compassion toward those
whose lives were damaged and hopeless. "Messiah will minister tenderly
to the weak, the bruised, and the oppressed. He is a friend to the humble,
contrite sinner—to every man who finds himself in need. Men who appear
to themselves and to others almost beyond hope will find in Him the
comfort, strength, and courage they so much need."—SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 4, p. 256.

   Explain how Jesus' life and death established "justice on earth"
(Isa. 42:4, NIV). Justice vindicates and establishes what is right.


    Part of God's plan was for Jesus to restore "the just law of the universe
to this earth."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 256. And He did so by
magnifying the law and making it honorable (Isa. 42:21; Matt. 5:17).
"Christ magnified the 'law' . . . both by precept and by example, proving it
to be wise and just. . . . In His Sermon on the Mount, Christ magnified the
law by applying its principles [Matt. 22:37-40; Deut. 6:5; Lev. 19:18] to
the motives of the heart as well as to the outward acts."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 4, p. 257.
    God's law is a transcript of His character. (See Patriarchs and
Prophets, p. 52.) The principles of His law are based on love (Matt. 22:37-
40) because His character is love. But Satan had so misrepresented God's
character that it was necessary for Jesus to reveal anew what God and His
law are all about. (See Exod. 20:5, 6; 34:6, 7; Jonah 4:2; Micah 7:18; John
1:18; 14:8, 9.) This He did as He ministered compassion and forgiveness
to the bruised reeds and smoldering wicks of human society (Luke 4:18).

   How has Jesus' compassion touched your life? How does His
 compassion help you to view others?




                                                                          19
Friday                                                  October 13
FURTHER STUDY: What parallels do you see between John's prepa-
ration for the first advent of Jesus and the preparation needed by those
awaiting His second advent? Read "The Voice in the Wilderness" in
The Desire of Ages, chapter 10, pp. 97-108. Also read Psalm 34:12-14;
Matthew 25:1-13; 26:41; 28:19, 20; Mark 13:33.

   "He [Christ] will not be like the teachers of His day. The ostentation
and show and parade of piety revealed in the priests and Pharisees is not
His way. [Isa. 42:3, 4 quoted.] Christ saw the work of the priests and rulers.
The very ones who needed help, the afflicted, the distressed, were treated
with words of censure and rebuke, and He forebore to speak any word that
would break the feeble reed. The dimly burning wick of faith and hope, He
would encourage, and not quench. He would feed His flock like a shep-
herd; He would gather the lambs with His arms, and carry them in His
bosom."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p.
1146.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What promises of the Bible have special meaning for you?
     Share with your class one or two promises that have given
     you comfort or assurance.

     2. The prophecies of the first advent of Jesus were largely
        misunderstood by the people of that day. Is it possible for
        those looking for the second advent of Jesus to misunder-
        stand the prophecies given about that event? Why or why
        not?

     3. What other prophecies of the first advent of Jesus do we
        find in the book of Isaiah? How were these fulfilled in the
        life of Jesus?

SUMMARY: How thankful we can be that God does not leave His
people without a message of hope for the future. The prophecies of the
Messiah in the book of Isaiah pointed forward with hope to the
coming Saviour. The Promised One was to rule with compassion,
bringing light in the midst of the world's darkness and providing a
way of salvation for lost humanity. The fulfillment of these predic-
tions in the life of Jesus gives us hope that the unfulfilled prophecies
concerning His second advent will also come to pass.
   We can live our lives on this earth with eager anticipation of the
fulfillment of God's Word.

Global Mission           I Know He Cares for Me, Part 2
    ‘   SIZ;7'                     Indrani Ariyaratnam

            Young Shamim awoke slowly. The ache in her leg reminded
        her that she had just had just undergone her eighth operation on her
                                                                               I
        leg, which had been injured in an accident. Would this surgery
        allow her to walk again?
            Shamim remembered something her sister Noreen had told her
        just before her surgery. Jesus loves and cares for little children.
                                                                               n
        The thought comforted the young girl now as she lay still, waiting
        for nurses to attend to her.
            Soon Shamim was able to go home, but she still could not walk.
                                                                               S
        "Never mind," she comforted herself. "God cares for me."
            Shamim's father yearned for his youngest child. She had a
        bright mind and was eager to learn. How could he help her? One         i
        day Father came to Shamim's bedside, smiling broadly. "I have
        found a school where children with physical problems can study
        and learn. And perhaps the teachers can even teach you to walk!"
            Shamim's eyes danced with delight. "Teach me to walk?"
        When Father left her alone, Shamim turned her face to the wall.
                                                                               d
        She wanted to talk this over with the God whom Noreen had told
        her about. "God, will You really help me to walk?" she pleaded.
            Shamin studied eagerly. Her brother had helped her to keep up
                                                                               e
         with her studies while she was confined to bed. Staff members
         exercised her legs, and soon Shamim took her first steps. After
         three years she could walk again!
            Then one day Shamim noticed that her leg had begun to swell
         again. "Oh, no!" she thought. "Please, God. Don't let my leg get
         bad again! I know You love me. Please take care of me."
            She was determined to complete her education, even when she
                                                                               S
         had to withdraw from the school because of her leg. "I must not
         give up," she determined." With her brother and sister's help, she
         studied at home and received high marks on her exams.
            Shamim was grateful that while many parents do not value
                                                                               t

         her family supported and helped her toward her dream of becom-
         ing a teacher. She studied typing and primary education, and soon
         had certificates in both, but could not find a job. Employers liked
                                                                               0
         her, and her credentials were excellent, but her handicap made it
         easier for them to hire someone else instead. "Never mind," Shamim
         thought to herself. "God cares for me."

                A Messiah
           Is Promised (Part II)




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 1:18-2:23; 26:47-
27:66.

     MEMORY TEXT: "All this took place to fulfill what the Lord
     had said through the prophet" (Matthew 1:22, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: God's prophets revealed details about the life of
Jesus, beginning with His birth and continuing with His life, death, and
resurrection. The New Testament records the fulfillment of these proph-
ecies and thus assures us that God is worthy of our trust.

    PROPHETIC MESSAGE FULFILLED. Zinzendorf asked Wesley:
"Do you think it was self-denial for the Lord Jesus to come down from
heaven to rescue a world? Was it self-denial?" "No," came the answer,
"it was love—love that swallows up everything, and first of all self."
    At the appointed time all was ready for that love to touch the
earth—an event toward which the Old Testament pointed, the coming
of the Messiah. The Godhead planned it before the creation of the
world (1 Peter 1:19, 20). God's promise shone through Adam and
Eve's despair (Gen. 3:15) and sparkled in the night skies for Abraham
(Gen. 22:17, 18). God's promise was marked in blood upon the door-
posts of the Hebrew slaves, assuring freedom from the bondage of toil
and sin (Exod. 12:1-13).
    Isaiah, Micah, and Jeremiah were but a few of the prophets who
foretold the Messiah's coming. We can turn the pages of the New
Testament and find these prophecies fulfilled. Because these predic-
tions came to pass, we can be confident that God's promises for us
will be fulfilled.

Sunday                                             October 15
THE BIRTH OF THE MESSIAH (Isa. 7:14).

    The Old Testament gives us a detailed picture of our Saviour's
ministry on earth. The primary application of some of the prophecies
is to the time in which the prophet wrote. But the New Testament
application to Jesus shows that God intended them to have an ex-
panded meaning. (For a discussion of prophecies with dual applica-
tions, see SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, pp. 1017-1019.)

  Who would be the Saviour's mother, and where would He be
born? Isa. 7:14 (compare Matt. 1:22, 23); Micah 5:2 (compare
Matt. 2:1).


   The Hebrew word for "virgin" is also translated "a young woman."
In Genesis 24:43 the word refers to "a woman about to be married."
(See also Prov. 30:19.) Through divine inspiration, Matthew under-
stood the woman mentioned in Isaiah 7:14 to be a type of the virgin
Mary.
   The name Immanuel (Isa. 7:14) means "God with us" and was
meant to help Ahaz understand that God could rescue him from his
enemies. Jesus was the fulfillment of this prophecy, for he was "God
with us" in the fullest sense (Isa. 9:6, 7).

   What do the following texts reveal about the lineage of the
Messiah? Gen. 12:1-3; 17:17-19; 2 Sam. 7:12-16 (compare Matt.
1:1-17).


   Matthew knew how important it was to trace Jesus' ancestry back
to Abraham. "Because the coming of Messiah is a matter of prophecy,
he [Matthew] shows that Jesus of Nazareth is indeed the One to whom
Moses and the prophets bore witness. Inasmuch as Messiah was to be
the seed of Abraham (Gen. 22:18; Gal. 3:16), the father of the Jewish
nation, and of David, founder of the royal line (Isa. 9:6, 7; 11:1; Acts
2:29, 30), Matthew presents evidence that Jesus qualifies as a descen-
dant of these two illustrious men."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5,
p. 276. (To study the differences between Matthew's and Luke's
genealogies, see SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, pp. 721, 722.)

    Look for verses in this week's Scripture passages that tell
 how these additional prophecies about the birth of Jesus were
 fulfilled. Jer. 31:15; Hosea 11:1.



                                                                     23
Monday                                             October 16
JESUS' MINISTRY (Mal. 3:1; 4:5, 6).

  A number of Old Testament prophecies announced Jesus' ministry.
Malachi joins Isaiah in telling about the one who would prepare the
way for the Messiah. Malachi also predicts the Messiah's cleansing
ministry.

  Summarize the identity and work of the one who would come
before the Messiah. Mal. 3:1; 4:5, 6.


   The messenger. Malachi prophesied of the "messenger" who would
prepare the way for the coming Messiah. He went on to identify him
as Elijah the prophet. Taking this literally, many Jews were looking
for a return of Elijah himself. "However, this is a prophecy of some-
one who was to come in 'the spirit and power' of Elijah (Luke 1:17),
that is, who would preach a message similar to that of Elijah."—SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 1134.
   When the angel announced to Zacharias the birth of John the
Baptist, he used Malachi's words to state his mission. And in referring
to this prophecy, Jesus clearly identified John the Baptist as the one
expected (Luke 7:24-28).

 According to the psalmist, what is one of the methods the
Messiah would use to communicate His message? Ps. 78:2, 3;
Matt. 13:34, 35.


   "Jesus desired to awaken inquiry. He sought to arouse the careless,
and impress truth upon the heart. Parable teaching was popular, and
commanded the respect and attention, not only of the Jews, but of the
people of other nations. No more effective method of instruction could
He have employed. If His hearers had desired a knowledge of divine
things, they might have understood His words; for He was always
willing to explain them to the honest inquirer."—Christ's Object Les-
sons, pp. 20, 21.
   In Deuteronomy 18:15, Moses spoke of yet another work the Mes-
siah would perform—the work of the prophet, speaking to the people
for God. Such work includes giving messages of warning, counsel,
and hope. In his sermon recorded in Acts 3, Peter applied this proph-
ecy to Jesus' role as God's spokesperson (verses 22, 23).

   How has God called you to speak for Him this week? How can
 you use the Old Testament prophecies to convince people that
 Jesus of Nazareth was the long-awaited Messiah?

THE FINAL DAYS (Zech. 9:9).

    Old Testament prophets reveal details about the close of Jesus'
life. How does the prophet Zechariah describe the triumphal en-
try of Jesus into Jerusalem? Zech. 9:9 (compare Matt. 21:1-5).


   When Jesus rode into Jerusalem, shouts of praise greeted Him. As
the people spread the branches before Him, they fulfilled Zechariah's
prophecy. When the Pharisees tried to rebuke the people, Jesus re-
minded the leaders that if they would not praise Him, "the stones
would immediately cry out!" (Luke 19:40). For had not Zechariah
prophesied that there would be shouts of rejoicing?
    In just a few short days the praises would turn to shouts of "Cru-
cify him" (Luke 23:21). The Messiah, who was the foundation of the
Israelite system of worship, was rejected. This, too, the psalmist
prophesied: "The stone the builders rejected has become the capstone"
(Ps. 118:22, NIV).

   Psalm 41:9 and 55:12-14 indicate who would betray the Mes-
siah. The betrayer would not be a stranger but one of His close
friends. Judas, who had spent more than three years in close compan-
ionship with Jesus, betrayed Him for 30 pieces of silver (Matt. 26:14,
15). Zechariah even foretold the amount of money Judas would re-
ceive for the act and the final use to be made of it. (See Zech. 11:12,
13 and Matt. 27:3-10.)

   How were the following texts fulfilled during the final days of
Jesus?

Zech. 13:7


Ps. 35:11; 27:12


Ps. 38:13, 14


    Is your confidence in the Bible based on these fulfilled proph-
 ecies? What else gives you confidence in God's Word?
    "When God's written word was given through the Hebrew
 prophets, Satan studied with diligence the messages concerning
 the Messiah. . . . These prophecies caused Satan to fear and
 tremble."—Prophets and Kings, p. 686.

                                                                    25

THE CRUCIFIED CHRIST (Mark 15:1-41).

   As we review the events of the crucifixion, we discover that the
prophets of the Old Testament foretold them.

  Compare the New Testament fulfillments with the Old Testa-
ment predictions listed below.

     Old Testament Predictions       New Testament Fulfillments

  Isa. 50:6—The Messiah would        Matt. 27:26, 30
  be beaten and spat upon.

  Ps. 109:4, 24, 25—The Messiah      Matt. 26:60-66; John 19:17;
  would be accused. Weakened         Luke 23:26
  by fasting, He would be an ob-
  ject of scorn.

  Isa. 53:12—The Messiah would       Mark 15:27
  suffer with transgressors.

  Zech. 12:10—The Messiah            John 19:18, 34, 37
  would be "pierced."

  Ps. 69:9, 21—The Messiah           Mark 15:29, 30; John 19:28,
  would be insulted and given vin-   29
  egar to drink.

  Ps. 34:20—The Messiah's bones      John 19:33
  would not be broken.

  Isa. 53:9—The Messiah would        Matt. 27:57-60
  be buried in a rich man's tomb.

   The predictions of modern psychics fail to come true. Yet the
prophets who wrote about the crucifixion of Christ did so centuries
before it occurred. The fact that all their predictions came to pass
gives us confidence in the inspiration of the Bible.

   Today, many people base their plans upon their horoscope or
the advice of a clairvoyant. To Christians, this is sinful non-
sense. Yet to what extent do you trust God's sure Word? What
can you do when you find yourself questioning God's plans for
your life? How does Romans 10:17 help you?

THE RESURRECTED CHRIST (Isa. 53:9-12).

   Summarize what Isaiah says about the Messiah's burial place.
Isa. 53:9. How was this prophecy fulfilled? Matt. 27:57-60.

   "With the wicked." "The righteous Servant . . . was given the
burial of a sinner, not of a saint. Having given up His life for trans-
gressors, He was placed with them in death."—SDA Bible Commen-
tary, vol. 4, p. 291.

   How do the following texts describe the promise of the resur-
rection of the Messiah and of those who trust in Him? Ps. 16:10;
49:15.


   "He shall receive me." "Better, 'He shall receive me for Himself.'
In this short clause, all the more powerful because of its brevity, is a
suggestion of the doctrine of a future life and the resurrection from the
dead. . . . In Gen. 5:24 another form of the same verb describes the
translation of Enoch (see 2 Kings 2:10)."—SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 3, p. 750.

   Jesus was crucified on Friday, and the following Sunday morning,
when the women went to the tomb to anoint His body with spices, they
found that He had already risen (Mark 16:6, 7). His body had not
experienced the decay of death, just as foretold by the psalmist (Ps.
16:10; compare Acts 2:24-28). In his sermon in the synagogue at
Antioch in Pisidia, Paul preached about the resurrection of Jesus and
the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy (Acts 13:34-38).
    Psalm 68:18 and 110:1 describe Jesus' ascension and reinstate-
ment in heaven. After His resurrection, Jesus ascended to heaven to
sit at the right hand of His Father. His work on earth in providing a
sacrifice for the sins of humanity was completed. A period of heav-
enly ministry would precede His second advent.
    When Jesus ascended, He promised that the Holy Spirit would give
spiritual gifts to His people (Luke 24:49; Acts 1:8). He assured us that
His ministry in heaven would continue until His promised second
coming (John 14:1-3). Each of these promises, and many more, we
accept by faith—faith that is strengthened by fulfilled prophecy.

    How does the following text apply to your life? "Do not quench
 the Spirit; do not despise prophetic utterances. But examine
 everything carefully; hold fast to that which is good" (1 Thess.
5:19-21, NASB).


                                                                       27
Friday                                              October 20
FURTHER STUDY: Read Psalm 22, sometimes called "The Psalm
of the Cross." Make a list of the verses that contain events surrounding
the crucifixion of Jesus.
    Read "The Coming of a Deliverer" in Prophets and Kings, chapter
58, pp. 681-702, and "Thessalonica" in The Acts of the Apostles,
chapter 22, pp. 221-230.

   "The Saviour of prophecy was to come, not as a temporal king, to
deliver the Jewish nation from earthly oppressors, but as a man among
men, to live a life of poverty and humility, and at last to be despised,
rejected, and slain. The Saviour foretold in the Old Testament Scrip-
tures was to offer Himself as a sacrifice in behalf of the fallen race,
thus fulfilling every requirement of the broken law. In Him the sacrifi-
cial types were to meet their antitype, and His death on the cross was
to lend significance to the entire Jewish economy."—The Acts of the
Apostles, pp. 227, 228.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How does fulfilled prophecy contribute to your confidence
     in the Bible as God's inspired Word?

     2. What other Bible prophecies have strengthened your faith
        in God's Word?

     3. How can you use this week's lesson to help you witness to
        others regarding the inspiration of the Bible?

SUMMARY: God inspired the Old Testament prophets to write of the
coming Messiah's life and ministry on this earth. Their expectations
were fulfilled just as prophesied. For the Jews living in the time of
Jesus, this could have provided the evidence they needed to recognize
Jesus as the long-awaited Messiah. But many chose to close their eyes
to the evidence and reject the Messiah.
    The prophecies assure us that Jesus is the Messiah and that we can
trust God's Word in every detail. As we await the fulfillment of the
prophecies of Jesus' second advent, we do so with the confidence that
all God's promises are certain.

                         I Know He Cares for Me, Part 3
       EIF                        Indrani Ariyaratnam

            Shamim was disappointed as she left the job interview. "Noreen,"
        she confided in her sister as she hobbled toward the street. "I
        thought if I worked hard enough and did well enough, I could be
        independent, but now no one will let me work."
            Noreen did not know what to say. What would happen to her
        younger sister? She drew Shamim close to her. "God cares for
        you. He has plans for you." Shamim closed her eyes tight against
        the tears that threatened to fall. "Yes," she whispered to God. "1
        believe You care for me. Please help me."
            One day her brother, Stephen, came home with news. "Shamim,
        I heard of a job you might be able to do." Shamim listened intently
        as her brother explained the work of taking marketing surveys.
        "You will have to walk," he said. "Are you strong enough?"
            "Yes!" she nearly shouted. "I will do it!" Shamim would not
        allow even one doubt to creep into her mind. She would make her
        crippled legs walk so that she could earn her own way!
            Shamim joined the marketing group and worked hard, in spite
        of discomfort and swelling in her leg. But she wondered, "Is this
        all life holds for me? What will happen when this job ends?"
            One afternoon while Shamim visited with her friend Martha, a
         young man came to the door. "I am Yousaf," he said to Martha. "I
         sell health magazines and books that I would like to show you."
         He noticed Shamim sitting in the corner, listening intently. As
         Yousaf showed Martha the books, Shamim thought, I can do this
         kind of work! I can sell books and magazines! Shamim excused
         herself and left Martha and Yousaf to talk about the books.
            Some time later Shamim met Yousaf at another friend's home.
         Shamim wanted to talk about Yousaf's work. But Yousaf wanted
         to know more about Shamim.
            "Yousaf likes you, Shamim," whispered her friend. "He is a
         convert from Islam. His family has disowned him, and he has no
         one." Butterflies danced inside Shamim's stomach. Could it be
         that God was sending her someone special to care for her?
            "Please, God," Shamim whispered. "You have taken care of me
         all these years. Please do not stop now!"

              The Time Is Right




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Gal. 4:4, 5; Daniel 9.

   MEMORY TEXT: "But when the fulness of the time was come,
   God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,
   to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive
   the adoption of sons" (Galatians 4:4, 5).

   KEY THOUGHT: The coming of Christ to earth is the greatest
event in history. God did not leave us without information concerning
the time of Christ's appearance. A study of Daniel's prophecy in
Daniel 9 gives us confidence that Jesus began His ministry when the
time was right.

    THE FULLNESS OF TIME. A man was working on what was at
the time the world's largest earthen-filled dam. He was atop a 130-
foot surge tank when a crane struck him in the back with a cable,
plunging him toward the concrete below. But halfway to his death a
fellow worker, wearing a safety belt, reached out and grabbed the
plummeting man by the neck as he passed by, thus saving his life.
    When studying the life of Jesus, we are reminded that He appeared
at just the right time. Jesus Himself said, "The time is fulfilled, and the
kingdom of God is at hand" (Mark 1:15). What did He mean by the
words "The time is fulfilled"?
    There are many Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah.
In the book of Daniel we find an explicit time prophecy regarding the
start of His public ministry. When we understand this prophecy, it
gives us added confidence that "truly this was the Son of God" (Matt.

THE TIME IS HERE (Mark 1:14, 15).

   The world needed Jesus. The time was right to clarify the miscon-
ceptions humanity had about God's character. Even His own people
had lost sight of the Messiah's mission. The time had arrived for God
to intervene and restore knowledge concerning His salvation.

 What does Jesus declare to be the purpose of His coming?
Mark 1:14, 15.


   Jesus knew it was necessary for people to understand that the
prophets foretold His mission. "Thus the gospel message, as given by
the Saviour Himself, was based on< the prophecies. The 'time' which
He declared to be fulfilled was the, period 'made known by the angel
Gabriel to Daniel."—The Desire of Ages, p. 233.

  Summarize in your words why it was necessary for Jesus to
come. What was humanity's greatest need? Gal. 4:4, 5.


   Satan's lies held humanity captive. People everywhere had come to
believe that God was a tyrant. Believing they could save themselves
by their own works, they worshiped the creation, not the Creator.
They needed to know that the Messiah would free them from the
burden of trying to save themselves by keeping the law in their own
strength. They needed to understand that Jesus could free them from
sin and its penalty, thus enabling them to be adopted into God's family
as His children.
   The time was now. "Like the stars in the vast circuit of their
appointed path, God's purposes know no haste and no delay."—The
Desire of Ages, p. 32. Daniel's prophecy, rightly understood, pointed
God's people to the time when the Messiah would come. And if they
had been observant, they would have known that the time was present.

    "When the world was destitute of the knowledge of God,
 Jesus came to impart this inestimable blessing—a knowledge of
 the paternal character of our heavenly Father. This was His own
 gift to our world; and this gift He committed to His disciples, to
 be communicated by them to the world."—Testimonies to Minis-
 ters, p. 193. Because it is His gift to the world, it is His gift to you.
 Think of specific ways you can increase your knowledge of
 God's character and how you can share that knowledge with
 others.

DANIEL'S PRAYER FOR GRACE (Dan. 9:1-19).

   Daniel 9 opens with Daniel's need to understand God's plan for the
chosen people. The 70 years of Israel's exile were nearing an end, and
Daniel expected they would soon return to the Promised Land. But
could it be that the prophecy of chapter 8, which predicted further
desolation of the sanctuary, meant additional captivity?
   "Although the Lord had promised deliverance to His people at the
time appointed, Daniel knew of the conditional nature of many of
God's promises (see Jer. 18:7-10). He may have feared that the im-
penitence of his people might postpone the fulfillment of the prom-
ise."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 849.

   How did Daniel approach God through prayer? Dan. 9:3.


   We can talk to God as a friend at any time, in any place. But Daniel
did not treat his communication with God lightly. The nature of his
preparation "is a judgment on our tendency to approach God easily
and carelessly. . . . Prayer has its disciplines, and the more serious our
need the more agonizing must be our prayer."—The Interpreter's
Bible, vol. 6, p. 485.

  As you read Daniel 9:4-19, jot down words Daniel used to
describe God's character and the nature of the people.

      God's Character                  The Nature of the People




   "Great and dreadful God" (Dan. 9:4). The Hebrew word trans-
lated "dreadful" means "awe-inspiring" or "revered." (See Neh. 1:5;
9:32; Ps. 111:9.) Daniel's basis for trust was God's attributes, all of
which inspire awe in the believer. Surely God will do what is right
toward His people. On the other hand, the people had no basis upon
which to ask for God's favor. Yet Daniel boldly asked for God's
continued favor toward His people, not because of their righteousness,
"but for thy great mercies" (Dan. 9:18). This is the key to all our
requests to God. All that we have in Christ is not because of our own
goodness or because we deserve any of these blessings but because of
God's goodness and grace toward us.

   When have you experienced God's goodness in spite of your
 own attitude of disobedience or unfaithfulness?

GOD'S RESPONSE (Dan. 9:19-23).

  What does Daniel ask God to do for His people? Dan. 9:19.


   Daniel's concern for the people. "Concluding that Israel's trans-
gression as a nation was responsible for what he evidently took to be
an extension of the 70 years . . . Daniel interceded most earnestly with
God for forgiveness, for the return of the captive exiles, and for the
restoration of the now desolate sanctuary in Jerusalem."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 4, p. 850.

   How did God respond to Daniel's intercession on behalf of
Israel? Dan. 9:20-23.


   God did not want Daniel to fear that He was extending the captivity
of His people. Thus He sent Gabriel with the answers Daniel needed.
While Daniel was speaking, God answered His questions about the
supposed delay in His promise to restore His people. While God does
not always respond to prayer in the exact manner we would wish, He
always answers when and as He knows is best.

  Summarize the following texts concerning God's willingness to
hear and answer your prayers.

Isa. 58:9


Ps. 32:6


Isa. 65:24


   "Before they call." "In their sin and distress the Israelites had
called upon God. . . . But God had plainly told them that it was
because of their sins that He could not hear their prayers. . . . Now,
with hearts renewed by divine grace, sending up petitions according to
the will of God, there would be no delay in response."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 4, p. 334.

    Has God sometimes answered your prayer "while you were
 yet speaking"? How did this make you feel about God's willing-
 ness to answer prayer?

                                                                     33
Wednesday                                           October 25
THE PROPHETIC TIMETABLE (Dan. 9:25).

   Gabriel pointed to a prophetic time period of 70 weeks. Using the
principle of a day in prophecy representing an actual year (see Ezek.
4:6 and Num. 14:34), this would represent a period of 490 years.

   What event marked the beginning point of this prophecy? Dan.
9:25.


   The command of King Artaxerxes I to "restore and to build Jerusa-
lem" (Dan. 9:25) is recorded in Ezra 7:11-26. It was the third and final
decree that gave the exiled Jews the right to return to Jerusalem to
rebuild the temple and the authority to appoint civil officials. This
decree was issued in the seventh year of Artaxerxes' reign, the year
457 B.C.

  How long a period of time would there be until the coming of
"Messiah the Prince"? Dan. 9:25.


    A score is twenty, so "threescore and two weeks" added to the
"seven weeks" make a total of sixty-nine weeks. With each day
representing a year, the total is 483 years. Since the beginning date of
the total seventy years was 457 B.C., the sixty-nine years extended to
A.D. 27, when the Messiah, or "Anointed One," would appear. Jesus
was anointed by the Holy Spirit at His baptism in the "fifteenth year
of the reign of Tiberius Caesar" (Luke 3:1, 21, NIV). Tiberius reigned
from A.D. 14 to 37. Following the nonaccession-year method of
reckoning the reign of kings, used in the early Roman Empire, Tiberius'
first year was from the death of Augustus to the next New Year's Day,
August 19—October 14, A.D. 14. (See SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5,
pp. 245-247.) Hence, Tiberius' fifteenth year was autumn to autumn,
A.D. 27/28. Jesus was baptized in the autumn of A.D. 27, the very
date foretold by Daniel. The final week of the prophecy would begin
in A.D. 27 and end in A.D. 34. (See the chart in Prophets and Kings,
p. 698.)
    Daniel 9:26 establishes that the Messiah would be put to death
after 62 weeks, that is, after the 434 years that follow 408 B.C.
(compare verse 25; 457 B.C. + 7 weeks, or 49 years = 408 B.C.). In
three and one-half years after A.D. 27, the Messiah was crucified,
halfway through the final week (verse 27). Following the Messiah's
death, Jerusalem and the temple were to be destroyed (verses 26, 27).

THE PROPHETIC MISSION (Dan. 9:24, 27).

   The prophecy of Daniel 9 is more than just a timetable of prophetic
dates. It is a message replete with the beauty of the mission of Jesus
Christ, our Saviour.

   How did Gabriel describe the purpose of the 490-year proph-
ecy? Dan. 9:24.


   While Daniel was concerned about the future of his people, God
wanted him to understand that the prophetic message he received was to
encompass all people. In this verse is a revelation of God's plan to deal
with the sins of all humanity and bring in everlasting righteousness
through the Messiah's ministry in the heavenly sanctuary.
   "The most Holy." "In view of the fact that the Hebrew phrase
cannot elsewhere be shown to refer definitely to a person, and in view
of the fact that the heavenly sanctuary is under discussion in the larger
aspects of the vision . . . it is reasonable to conclude that Daniel is here
speaking of the anointing of the heavenly sanctuary prior to the time
of Christ's inauguration as high priest."—SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 4, p. 852.

   What would occur during the final week of the prophetic pe-
riod? Dan. 9:27.


   This final week of the prophecy would focus on God's covenant
people. For the first three and one-half years, Jesus would preach the
message of salvation to the Jews. The disciples would continue to
preach to them for another three and one-half years. In the midst of
the prophetic week, the Messiah would "cause the sacrifice and the
oblation to cease" (Dan.9:25). The sacrifices and services of the
temple pointed forward to the Messiah's ministry.
   "In the spring of A.D. 31, Christ the true sacrifice was offered on
Calvary. Then the veil of the temple was rent in twain, showing that
the sacredness and significance of the sacrificial service had departed.
The time had come for the earthly sacrifice and oblation to cease.
   "The one week—seven years—ended in A.D. 34. Then by the
stoning of Stephen the Jews finally sealed their rejection of the gos-
pel."—The Desire of Ages, p. 233.

FURTHER STUDY: Read "The Fullness of the Time" in The Desire
of Ages, chapter 3, pp. 31-38. What conditions on earth contributed to
the time's being right for the coming of the Saviour? What changes
would have been necessary for the Jews to be ready to receive the
Messiah? What will conditions on earth be like when Christ returns?
Matt. 24:3-14; Luke 17:22-30; 2 Tim. 3:1-5.

   "Christ urged upon His disciples the importance of prophetic study.
Referring to the prophecy given to Daniel in regard to their time, He
said, `Whoso readeth, let him understand.' Matt. 24:15. . . .
   "As the message of Christ's first advent announced the kingdom of
His grace, so the message of His second advent announces the king-
dom of His glory. And the second message, like the first, is based on
the prophecies. . . .
   "The Jews misinterpreted and misapplied the word of God, and
they knew not the time of their visitation. . . . Earthly ambitions
absorbed them, and the offer of the spiritual kingdom came to them in
vain. So today the kingdom of this world absorbs men's thoughts, and
they take no note of the rapidly fulfilling prophecies and the tokens of
the swift-coming kingdom of God."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 234,
235.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How are the conditions in our world today similar to those
     at the time of Jesus' first advent? Why does this mean that
     the fullness of time for the second coming of Jesus is near?

   2. What principles of prayer did you learn from Daniel's
      prayer of intercession for his people?

   3. How would you explain the message of the prophecy of
      Daniel 9 to a non-Christian friend?

   4. What changes do you think you will have to make in order
      to be ready when Christ comes again? Ask for His grace to
      help you make those changes.

SUMMARY: How full of meaning are the words of Jesus, "The time
is fulfilled" (Mark 1:15). After centuries of waiting, the prophetic
timetable of Daniel 9 was nearing completion. The mission of grace
was at hand as Jesus began His three-and-one-half-year ministry.
    The fulfillment of this prophecy gives us assurance that unfulfilled
prophecies will be fulfilled. Just as the earthly ministry of Jesus came
at the "fullness of time," so His second coming will occur at just the
right time.

          "Noreen, Noreen! Where are you?" Shamim's voice held an
       excitement her sister had not heard before.
          "What is it?" Noreen said as she hurried into the room.
          "I must talk to you!" Excitedly Shamim poured out the story
       of Yousaf, a book salesman whom she had met at a friend's
       home. He had become a Christian and his family had disowned
       him. Her eyes sparkled as she told her sister about him. Then she
       asked, "Do you think this could be God's way of caring for me?"
          "Yes, little sister. God is caring for you," Noreen said.
          From the Bible, Yousaf shared truths Shamim had not known
       before. "This is wonderful! I always knew God cared for me, but
       I never really knew Him." Yousaf invited Shamim to visit the
       publishing director of the Pakistan Section, with whom Yousaf
       worked. The two young people began studying the Bible to-
       gether, and Shamim's eager mind made her an excellent student.
       As she learned more about the God who had loved and cared for
       her all her life, she accepted the pastor's invitation to be baptized.
          Eager to begin her new Christian walk, Shamim joined the
       colporteur ministry and began helping Yousaf with his work. As
       they worked together, they realized God had more in store for
       them than a life work, and they invited the pastor who baptized
       Shamim to unite their lives in marriage.
          Shamim's heart overflowed with joy to her Saviour and her
       God. "But I want more, God," she whispered. "I want to teach!"
          One evening Pastor D. S. Ariyaratnam, president of the North-
       ern Section of Pakistan, came to Shamim and Yousaf s home.
       "Shamim, you have talents that you can use for God. We would
       like to invite you to join our teaching staff at Adventpura Church
       School. Please pray about it and ask God for His will."
           But Shamim did not have to pray. She already knew God
       wanted her to teach. And with joy in her heart, she answered,
       "Yes, I will teach. God has taken care of me all my life. I must
       give Him my best!"
           Her heart is filled with joy to God, who stood by her when she
        was injured, loved her when she was lonely, and gave her more
        happiness than she knew possible.

          The Suffering Servant




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Isaiah 53.

     MEMORY TEXT: "He was pierced for our transgressions, he
     was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us
     peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed" (Isaiah
     53:5, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Jesus willingly suffered the penalty for our sin,
so that we might receive God's gift of His righteousness, thereby
experiencing salvation and healing.

    TRUE SERVANTHOOD. Jane Addams (1860-1935), cowinner
of the 1931 Nobel peace prize, dedicated her life to serving others. At
the age of six she traveled with her father to one of the many pioneer
towns in the United States. The squalor in this town was so appalling
that she stated, "When I grow up, I want to live . . . near the poor
people so I can help them."—Charles L. Wallis, ed., A Treasury of
Sermon Illustrations (New York: Abingdon-Cokesbury Press, 1950),
p. 60. Thus was planted the seed that would grow into the Hull House
ministry of Chicago—a ministry that now supports child care, coun-
seling, and housing services.
    Many have served others sacrificially. But none can compare to the
suffering Servant of Isaiah 53. In this chapter, Isaiah, the gospel
prophet, points to the ministry of the Messiah as the remedy for sin.
    The New Testament reveals that the suffering Servant of Isaiah 53
is Jesus Christ. He is the only One able to save humanity from sin. In
His life He demonstrated true servanthood. Through His suffering and
death on the cross, He makes eternal life available to all. Isaiah's
portrayal of the Messiah gives everyone hope of redemption.

A SAVIOUR IS NEEDED (Isa. 53:4-6).

   Although created perfect and in close fellowship with God, Adam
and Eve sinned and thereby separated humanity from God. "All have
turned aside, they have together become corrupt; there is no one that
does good, not even one" (Ps. 14:3, NIV).

  How does Isaiah 53:5, 6 describe the human condition?


    Without God's intervention, humanity would be eternally lost. "It
is impossible for us, of ourselves, to escape from the pit of sin in
which we are sunken. Our hearts are evil, and we cannot change
them. . . . There must be a power working from within, a new life from
above, before men can be changed from sin to holiness."—Steps to
Christ, p. 18.
    Our natural tendency is to deny our own sinfulness. "The heart is
deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?"
(Jer. 17:9). We must not evaluate ourselves, but should accept what
God declares our condition to be. When we do, we also will see the
provisions He has made for our escape from sin.
    We cannot trust our own power, resources, and natural abilities to
deal with the sinfulness of our nature. "Education, culture, the exer-
cise of the will, human effort, all have their proper sphere, but here
they are powerless."—Steps to Christ, p. 18. We must look outside of
self for a solution to the sin problem.

   What is the answer to the dilemma in which we find ourselves?
Isa. 53:4-6; 1 Peter 2:21, 24.


   "The marvelous result of Christ's love for us is that we were once
like sheep going astray but have now returned to the Shepherd and
Overseer of our souls. . . . This is the ultimate example of love, given
to us by Jesus Christ. Martin Luther summarized the example of
Christ well when he wrote, 'When I consider my crosses, tribulations,
and temptations, I shame myself almost to death thinking what are
they in comparison to the sufferings of my blessed Savior Christ
Jesus.' "—Paul A. Cedar, The Communicator's Commentary: James,
1, 2 Peter, Jude (Waco, Tex.: Word Books, 1984), p. 151.

    What experience or event in your life has led you to see most
 clearly your need of a Saviour? How did God use that experi-
 ence to bring you closer to Jesus?

JESUS, THE SUFFERING ONE (Isa. 53:1-3).

  Summarize the reception Jesus would receive when He came as
our Saviour. Isa. 53:1-3.


   Looking back on the evidence Jesus gave of His identity, it may be
difficult for us to understand why His people did not recognize Him as
the Messiah. In his Gospel, John applies this prophecy of Isaiah to
Jesus when he records that many, even rulers, believed in Jesus but
were afraid to acknowledge their belief. "They loved praise from men
more than praise from God" (John 12:43, NIV; see also verses 37-42).
   The servanthood of Jesus. Jesus came in a role far different from
what the Jews expected. They were not looking for one who would
serve. But throughout His ministry Jesus revealed His willingness to
serve. His act of washing the feet of His disciples at their final meal
together showed that no act was beneath Him (John 13:1-17). Then
through His death on the cross He displayed His willingness to give up
everything for our salvation.

   How does Philippians 2:5-8 contribute to our understanding of
Jesus' willingness to give up all for us?


   "Men were not to be attracted to Christ by a display of supernatural
glory, but by the beauty of a righteous life."—SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 4, p. 290. In His wisdom, God knew how easily women and men
could be attracted to the physical appearance of the Messiah and
overlook the spiritual message He came to bring.
   All through His life Jesus encountered opposition to His work and
message. Even His own disciples did not understand the work He
came to do. At His crucifixion how few of His followers were there to
provide comfort and encouragement! Most fled in fear for their own
lives.
   Even Jesus recognized that His life would be full of suffering when
He stated to His disciples, "Why then is it written that the Son of Man
must suffer much and be rejected?" (Mark 9:12, NIV).

   Describe a time when you experienced the feeling of being
abandoned by your family or friends. How does this help you
understand how Jesus may have felt when His followers de-
serted Him during His time of suffering? What example for us is
provided by Jesus' attitude toward His loved ones who had
deserted Him?

JESUS, OUR SUBSTITUTE (Isa. 53:4-12).

   How does Isaiah describe the substitutionary nature of Jesus'
sacrifice in the following verses?

Isa. 53:4-6


Isa. 53:8


Isa. 53:11, 12


   Jesus did not deserve the suffering and death He experienced. It
was for our sake that He willingly endured the punishment for sin.
And He did so that we might receive His righteousness as a gift from
God. Through Jesus, all that was lost because of sin can be restored.
Through faith in Him we can share His triumph, along with all those
redeemed by His sacrifice.
   "Christ was treated as we deserve, that we might be treated as He
deserves. He was condemned for our sins, in which He had no share,
that we might be justified by His righteousness, in which we had no
share. He suffered the death which was ours, that we might receive the
life which was His. 'With His stripes we are healed.' "—The Desire of
Ages, p. 25.

   How does Peter emphasize the substitutionary nature of Jesus'
suffering and death? 1 Peter 2:22-24.


   Left to ourselves, we would find our condition hopeless. As Isaiah
states, "All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one
to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all"
(Isa. 53:6). It is through His death for us that we can be assured of
eternal life.

    In what ways does the following quotation challenge you?
 "Through the sacrifice made in our behalf, sins may be perfectly
 forgiven. Our dependence is not in what man can do; it is in
 what God can do for man through Christ. When we surrender
 ourselves wholly to God, and fully believe, the blood of Christ
 cleanses from all sin. . . . We are not to be anxious about what
 Christ and God think of us, but about what God thinks of
 Christ, our Substitute."--Selected Messages, book 2, pp. 32, 33.

                                                                   41

THE LAMB OF GOD (Isa. 53:7, 8).
   As the Ethiopian eunuch read Isaiah while traveling, the Spirit led
Philip to aid him in understanding what he was reading. Acts 8:32, 33
records that the Ethiopian was reading Isaiah 53:7, 8. These verses
introduce the imagery of Jesus' exhibiting the qualities of a lamb.
New Testament writers use this imagery a number of times.

   How do the following texts contribute to our understanding of
Jesus, the Lamb of God?

John 1:29, 35, 36


1 Peter 1:18, 19


Rev. 5:5-7


   Jesus came to fulfill the role of the lamb without spot or blemish
as sacrificed in the services of the sanctuary. Each animal brought for
sacrifice was to be pure and unblemished, reminding the sinner that
only by the death of the perfect "Lamb of God" could sin be forgiven.
Each service pointed forward to the death of Jesus Christ upon the
cross for the sins of the world.

 List ways Jesus specifically fulfilled the words of Isaiah 53:7.
Matt. 26:63; 27:12-14.


   During Jesus' trial, witnesses brought testimony to condemn Him.
"Patiently Jesus listened to the conflicting testimonies. No word did
He utter in self-defense." "Standing behind Pilate, in view of all in
the court, Christ heard the abuse; but to all the false charges against
Him He answered not a word. . . . He stood silent, but His silence was
eloquence. It was as a light shining from the inner to the outer
man."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 706, 726.
   Jesus knew that the testimony brought against Him was false. Yet
He did not rise to His own defense.

    How does the title "Lamb of God" help you understand the
 mission of Jesus?
    When confronted by verbal abuse, why is it sometimes wise
 to remain silent?

THE RESULTS OF HIS SACRIFICE (Isa. 53:5,10-12).

   What are the results of the Messiah's sacrifice? Isa. 53:5, 10-
12.


   Righteousness offered. It was not in vain that Jesus came to this
earth to live and die. The greatest need of human beings is for
righteousness. And yet "as it is written, There is none righteous, no,
not one" (Rom. 3:10). Were it not for the perfect life, death, and
resurrection of Jesus, all would be lost. But God foresaw the need
and provided Jesus, "the Lamb slain from the foundation of the
world" (Rev. 13:8). Through this provision God now offers the
perfect righteousness of Jesus Christ to all.

   Describe Jesus' attitude toward the sacrifice He made upon
the cross. Isa. 53:11, 12. What is your attitude toward His sacri-
fice?


   "By his knowledge." "The meaning of this phrase is not entirely
clear. It seems to refer to Christ's intimate knowledge of the charac-
ter and will of the Father, which He came to reveal to men (see Isa.
11:2; 50:4; Matt. 11:27; John 1:18; 5:19; 8:28; 10:15; 17:3)."—SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 292.
   "What sustained the Son of God in His betrayal and trial? . . . He
caught a view of the expanse of eternity and saw the happiness of
those who through His humiliation should receive pardon and ever-
lasting life. He was wounded for their transgressions, bruised for
their iniquities. The chastisement of their peace was upon Him, and
with His stripes they were healed. His ear caught the shout of the
redeemed. He heard the ransomed ones singing the song of Moses
and the Lamb."—Testimonies, vol. 8, pp 43, 44.
    Throughout eternity we will worship and praise Jesus for His self-
sacrificing love. For suffering shame and humiliation on earth, He
will have the place of supreme honor and esteem for eternity. (See
Phil. 2:9-11.)

    Isaiah 53:5 states, "With his stripes we are healed." In what
 area of your life do you most need to experience God's healing?
 What benefits do you have because of Jesus' suffering and
 death? How is Jesus' healing virtue made available to us in our
 daily struggle to fulfill His divine purpose for our lives?



                                                                     43

FURTHER STUDY: In the book of Revelation, the apostle John
often uses the imagery of the lamb when referring to the ministry of
Jesus. Using a Bible concordance, locate these passages. How do
these passages help you understand the mission of Jesus? Why is the
imagery of the lamb appropriate to Jesus' work?
   Read "Calvary" in The Desire of Ages, chapter 78, pp. 741-757.

   Of Isaiah 53, Ellen White wrote, "This chapter should be studied. It
presents Christ as the Lamb of God. Those who are lifted up with
pride, whose souls are filled with vanity, should look upon this picture
of their Redeemer, and humble themselves in the dust. The entire
chapter should be committed to memory. Its influence will subdue and
humble the soul defiled by sin and uplifted by self-exaltation."—Ellen
G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 1147.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How would you explain Jesus' role as our substitute to a
     non-Christian friend?

     2. How does the suffering Jesus endured help you when you
        experience suffering?

     3. Write a letter to God in which you express your response to
        the realization that Jesus was treated as you deserve so you
        might be treated as He deserves.

SUMMARY: The picture of Jesus shared by the prophet Isaiah gives
reason to praise God for the wonderful plan instituted for our salva-
tion. Jesus, the Lamb of God, died the death we deserve so that we
might have His perfect righteousness.
    Because of our sin, we deserve death. Through Christ, God gives us
life.

                           Jodie Bratcher

    International Teacher Service sends English teachers around
the world. While they are sent to teach English, the difference
they make in lives usually occurs outside the classroom.
    My family was serving in Magadan, Russia. It was October--
winter in Siberia. Workers struggled to get the roof on the new
church building before the snows halted work until spring.
    One day in English class we sang, "He's Got the Whole World in
His Hands." One student, Alexander, asked "Who is 'He'?" I
explained that the song was about God, then continued with class
discussion. After class Alexander walked home with me. As we
passed the new church building, Alexander asked me whether I
believed in God. "Oh, yes," I said. Alexander said he believed in logic.
    We looked at the church. I pointed out that the snows were
unusually late this year, and that I thought it was because people
were praying that the roof could be completed before the snows
came. Alexander said it was chance that it hadn't snowed.
    "I'm going to ask God to hold the snow until the roof is
finished to show you He can do it!" I said. Alexander just smiled.
Every day as we passed the church on our way home I said, "It
hasn't snowed yet." This went on for two weeks.
    Then Alexander's mother was hospitalized and scheduled for
surgery. I told him we would ask God to heal his mother. He
rolled his eyes and said "Yes, I know, just as you asked God to
 keep the snow away."
    "Maybe God is trying to talk to you," I said. We walked home
 in silence. Each day I prayed for the roof and for Alex's mother.
On the fourth day the roof was snowproof, and Alex's mother was
 released from the hospital without having surgery! That night we
 walked home from school--in two feet of snow! When we passed
 the church, I said, "The roof was finished yesterday."
                          Alex said, "I know. You won."
                          I said "Oh, no, I didn't win. God did!"
                       Since then Alex has had lots of questions
                       about God and the Bible.

                       Jodie and Greg Bratcher served with
                       International Teacher Service in Russia and
                       in China. They now live in Michigan, where
                       Jodie is nursing and Greg is studying toward
                       an advanced degree.

               A Compassionate
                   Mission




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Isaiah 61; Luke 4.

     MEMORY TEXT: "I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul
     shall be joyful in my God; for He has clothed me with the
     garments of salvation, He has covered me with the robe of
     righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with ornaments,
     and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels" (Isaiah 61:10,
     NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Isaiah clearly recognized the mission of the Mes-
siah as one that would bring healing, liberty, and restoration. Early in His
mission, Jesus applied Isaiah's message to His own ministry, thus identify-
ing Himself as the Messiah.

   HOPE FOR ALL. For those caught in the grasp of sin, the message of
liberty and healing is revitalizing. For those weighed down with the
burden of hopelessness, the "good tidings" of forgiveness and hope for the
future bring renewed vigor. The coming of the Messiah, Jesus Christ,
brings all this and more. Isaiah's message concerning the Messiah's
mission is one of the most hopeful in all the Bible. He offers a reversal of
the mourning, brokenheartedness, and captivity that are a result of sin.
   Jesus extends His compassion to every woman, man, and child and
meets every need of our lives. Do we emulate His concern for the suffer-
ing? What are our attitudes toward the poor and homeless, toward those
sick because of sin, those suffering from diseases resulting from moral
impurity, and toward the aged and the handicapped?

THE MESSIAH'S MISSION (Isa. 61:1-3, 10).

  Israel looked for the coming of the Messiah with eager anticipation.
And Isaiah paints a reassuring picture of the merciful nature of the
Messiah's mission.

   List the blessings God's people would experience from the ministry
of the Messiah. Isa. 61:1-3, 10.


   "Anointed me." "At the ceremony of anointing, an individual was set
apart for some particular office or mission. Aaron was anointed by Moses
to be high priest (Exod. 40:13). . . . Christ was to be anointed by God the
Father (Ps. 45:7) through the Holy Spirit (Acts 10:38) at the time of His
baptism (Mark 1:10; Luke 3:21, 22)."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p.
317.
   The imagery of "trees of righteousness" (Isa. 61:3) brings to mind
people who are firmly planted in the ways of righteousness, not those who
are blown about like chaff. (Compare Psalm 1.) Christ's ministry is to
bring firmness of purpose and a new life.

   How do the following texts contribute to your understanding of
God's work in clothing you "with the robe of righteousness" (Isa.
61:10)?

Zech. 3:1-5


Luke 15:22


Rev. 19:7, 8


   Righteousness available to all. In each of these references, the robe of
righteousness is freely given to the sinner. "This robe, woven in the loom
of heaven, has in it not one thread of human devising. Christ in His
humanity wrought out a perfect character, and this character He offers to
impart to us."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 311.
   Jesus lived a perfect life so that He might offer His perfect righteous-
ness to us. In exchange, He took our sinful, filthy garments (Isa. 64:6)
upon Himself when He died on the cross (Isa. 53:5).

    How is Jesus' compassion evident in His giving you His robe
 of perfect righteousness? Have you accepted His robe?

                                                                        47
Monday                                                 November 6
GOD'S PEOPLE RESPOND (Isa. 61:4-9).

  What results are seen in the lives of God's people in response to His
goodness toward them? Isa. 61:4-9.


    God's gifts of healing, liberty, and freedom result in the hope and
dedication of His people. Because of their acceptance by God, they are
now ready to fulfill His purposes for them. Even though physical and
spiritual ruin lie around them, they are ready for rebuilding. They desire to
let God use them as His agents in bringing revival and restoration.

     What specific role does God envision for His people? Isa. 61:6.


   This promise in Isaiah 61:6 is a repetition of the promise God gave to
Israel when He freed them from captivity in Egypt. (See Exod. 19:6.)

   How does Peter describe the function of the Christian believer as
priest? 1 Peter 2:9.


   The wonderful promises God made to ancient Israel could not be
fulfilled in detail because of national apostasy. These promises are now the
cherished possession of the Christian church. They are fulfilled in part
now but in fullness at the second advent of our Lord. (See Rev. 1:5, 6;
21:24.)
   "Peculiar" (1 Peter 2:9, KJV). "The expression translated 'peculiar
people' reads, literally, 'a people into possession,' meaning 'a people
whom God has come into possession of', or 'a people God has acquired
for Himself .'. . . Christ has acquired the church and considers it to be in a
special sense His own purchased possession."—SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 7, p. 562.
   God calls those who have experienced His grace to share the good news
with those who are still in darkness. Just as in the time of Isaiah, today
there are men, women, and children all around us who are unacquainted
with the compassionate mission of Jesus to bring them salvation. God's
desire is for all Christians to share the story of His grace with those within
their sphere of influence.
   There is no limit to the gratitude felt by those whom God has rescued from
death and brought into newness of life. The praise they give is the natural
result of recognizing their inability to free themselves from bondage to sin
and of accepting the gift of salvation freely offered to them.

     In what ways are you ministering His grace to those in need?

JESUS TEACHES IN GALILEE (Luke 4:14,15).

   Galilee is the land north of Judea and Samaria and includes the city of
Jesus' upbringing, Nazareth. It was in this area that Luke began his record
of Jesus' public ministry. He states, "Jesus returned in the power of the
Spirit into Galilee" (Luke 4:14).
   "Galilee was a more favorable field for the Saviour's work than
 Judea. . . . Wherever Jesus went, 'the common people heard him gladly'
(Mark 12:37)."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 726.
   It was at His baptism that the Holy Spirit descended upon Jesus, and the
Father affirmed His identity (Luke 3       22). And "being full of the Holy
Ghost" (Luke 4:1), Jesus was empowered to resist the temptations of the
devil in the wilderness.

  How did the presence of the Holy Spirit prepare Jesus to begin His
ministry in Galilee? Acts 10:38.


   "The power of the Spirit" (Luke 4:14). From the Greek word trans-
lated "power" comes the English word dynamite. Luke records that the
descent of the Holy Spirit upon Jesus resulted from Jesus' prayer (Luke
3:21, 22). If His ministry was to be effective, Jesus knew He needed the
Spirit to direct and empower Him.
   At the direction of the Spirit, Jesus entered the wilderness where He
encountered the evil one and overcame his temptations. Again the Spirit
was at work in the life of the Saviour. Through the demanding circum-
stances of His ministry, the Spirit was actively with Him at all times.
    As the Spirit qualified Jesus for His earthly ministry, so He will qualify
us for our ministry. (See John 14:16-23.) Only through His power is gospel
teaching effective. (See Acts 4:31-34.)

   What was the response of those who heard Jesus' Spirit-empow-
ered message? Luke 4:14, 15.


   Without serious opposition to His message at this time, Jesus was able
to bring the good news of salvation to receptive hearts.
   Just as Jesus promised the power of the Spirit to His followers (Acts
1:8), so He promises power for ministry today through the working of the
Holy Spirit in our lives. When we share the good news of salvation
through the power of the Spirit, lives will change, and those hearing the
message will experience salvation.

   How do you know the Holy Spirit is working in your life?
 How can you be more receptive to the Spirit?

                                                                           49
Wednesday                                              November 8
JESUS PROCLAIMS HIS MISSION (Isa. 61:1, 2; Luke 4:16-21).

   One of the cities Jesus visited during His ministry in Galilee was His
hometown of Nazareth. The residents of this city had watched the Son of
Mary and Joseph grow from a small child to adulthood. Jesus continued
His custom of worshiping in the synagogue, and the leaders there invited
Him to read and comment upon the Scriptures.

  What did Jesus' reading of Isaiah 61:1, 2 tell His hearers about His
mission? Luke 4:16-21.


   This passage held hope for Israel. They understood Isaiah 61:1, 2 to be
an obvious Messianic prophecy. "His impressive manner and the wonder-
ful import of His words thrilled the hearers with a power they had never
felt before. The tide of divine influence broke every barrier down; like
Moses, they beheld the Invisible. As their hearts were moved upon by the
Holy Spirit, they responded with fervent amens and praises to the Lord."
—The Desire of Ages, p. 237.
    By applying these verses to His ministry, Jesus clearly identified
Himself as the Messiah and revealed the compassionate nature of His
work. He had not come to establish an earthly kingdom or to gain the
popularity of the masses. His mission was to meet more than physical
needs. He would mend broken lives and hearts.
   Jesus' statement in verse 21 startled His listeners. By stating that He
was fulfilling this ministry that day, Jesus drew their attention to their own
spiritual condition. It would be difficult for them to miss His point that they
were poor, blind, downtrodden, and captive. They were in need of His
healing and release from bondage.

   How does the message to the church at Laodicea apply to the
condition of Jesus' hearers? Rev. 3:17, 18.


   "Need of nothing." "The climax of the Laodiceans' boast is that their
situation could not be improved. Such self-satisfaction is fatal, for the
Spirit of God never enters where a need for His presence is not felt, yet
without that presence newness of life is impossible."—SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 7, p. 762.

    When do you find it the most difficult to admit your true
 condition and your need of God's healing? How does the mes-
 sage to Laodicea give you hope?

RESPONSE TO JESUS' MINISTRY (Luke 4:23-44).

   While those gathered spoke well of Jesus and "wondered" at the words
He spoke, they were unwilling to acknowledge Him as the Messiah. Even
though there was ample evidence of His power in the teaching and healing
He performed in Galilee, their question "Is not this Joseph's son?" re-
vealed their reluctance to accept Him fully.
   His directness in identifying their spiritual need alienated them. "Their
pride was offended, and their fears were roused. The words of Jesus
indicated that His work for them was to be altogether different from what
they desired."—The Desire of Ages, p. 237.

  What did Jesus further imply about the spiritual condition of His
hearers? Luke 4:23-27.


   Jesus saw through the outward appearance of religiosity and spoke to
the unrepentant hearts of His hearers. "The words of Jesus to His hearers in
the synagogue struck at the root of their self-righteousness, pressing home
upon them the bitter truth that they had departed from God and forfeited
their claim to be His people. Every word cut like a knife as their real
condition was set before them."—The Desire of Ages, p. 239.
   Jesus' reference to the widow of Zarephath and to Naaman further
angered those gathered in the synagogue. They prided themselves on their
heritage as children of Israel. Yet Jesus pointed to Gentiles as examples of
faithful hearers. They did not miss the implied rebuke. They responded
quickly and angrily by seeking to destroy Him.
   The compassionate nature of Jesus' mission compelled Him to take
every opportunity to reach the hearts of those in his hometown. Even
though they rejected Him, they also were in need of the salvation He so
freely offered.

  How do Jesus' actions after this encounter show His fulfilling the
mission outlined in Isaiah? Luke 4:31-44.


   Luke records the activities of Jesus in teaching with authority, casting
out demons, and healing those who came to Him. His divine mission of
compassion to those caught in sin was fulfilled in both word and deed.

    When did you first realize the compassion of God toward
 you? How did you respond to this revelation? List ways you can
 reveal the compassionate nature of God to others.

FURTHER STUDY: Read Isaiah 60 and 61. Compare the message of
the two chapters. What does each chapter reveal about the mission of
the Messiah? How does each reveal God's purpose for His people?
What is the result of God's work in the lives of His people? What is
the impact on those who do not know God?
   Read "The Kingdom of God Is at Hand" in The Desire of Ages, chapter
23, pp. 231-235, and " 'Is Not This the Carpenter's Son?' " in The Desire
of Ages, chapter 24, pp. 236-243.

   "Few realize the full meaning of the words that Christ spoke when, in
the synagogue at Nazareth, He announced Himself as the Anointed One.
He declared His mission to comfort, bless, and save the sorrowing and the
sinful; and then, seeing that pride and unbelief controlled the hearts of His
hearers, He reminded them that in time past God had turned away from His
chosen people because of their unbelief and rebellion, and had manifested
Himself to those in heathen lands who had not rejected the light of heaven.
The widow of Sarepta and Naaman the Syrian had lived up to all the light
they had; hence they were accounted more righteous than God's chosen
people who had backslidden from Him and had sacrificed principle to
convenience and worldly honor."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 416.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Are there times when it is more compassionate to allow
     people to experience the natural consequences of their deci-
     sions? How do you know when it is appropriate to intervene
     in the lives of those who are in need?

     2. Express in your own words the thoughts put forth in Isaiah
        61:4-8, indicating as you do so the responses you have to
        God's goodness.

     3. How can people in your church work together to demon-
        strate God's love and compassion?

SUMMARY: When Jesus announced that His mission was the fulfill-
ment of Isaiah 61, He identified Himself as the Messiah. His mission
was to bring healing and freedom to those caught in sin and suffering.
While His hearers at the synagogue in Nazareth responded with disbe-
lief and hostility, others received the ministry of Jesus with belief and
acceptance. As Christ's people, we are to continue His mission of
extending compassion and hope to the world.

                               25 Years to Decide!
                                    Adly Campos

             The sun's burning rays seemed hotter than usual that morning
         in Mexico City. Dust from the street sifted in through the car's
         open windows as we wound through the streets. A few minutes
         later we arrived at the Estrada home. Mrs. Estrada, a sweet,
         young, woman, greeted us at the door and ushered us into the
         livingroom.
             After greeting the family, I faced Mr. Estrada. "I understand
         that your wife and daughters have accepted Jesus and been bap-
         tized, but you have not. What has kept you from this important
         step?
             He was silent a few minutes, then said, "I learned about the
         gospel as a boy in my parents' home, but I have never felt ready
         for baptism. I quit my job to keep the Sabbath; I pay my tithe, and
         God has blessed me. But I don't feel ready for baptism. Perhaps
         when my daughter turns 15, I will get baptized."
             "Mr. Estrada," I asked. "Do you believe that faith in Jesus is
         based on sentiments or on principle?" I read 1 Samuel 15:22. "Do
         you think God should wait until we feel like obeying Him? (John
          14:15,21). Finally, can you be sure you will live until you daughter's
          15th birthday?" Then I turned to the daughter and asked if she
          would like her father to be baptized when she is 15 years old, or
          would she prefer for him to do it now.
             She replied, "I want my father to be baptized now so we can
          worship God as a family together."
             After we prayed, Mr. Estrada requested baptism. The whole
          family was present at the remaining meetings, and at the end of
          the evangelistic series Mr. Estrada joined his family as a member
          of the Adventist Church. That evening Mr. and Mrs. Estrada
          renewed their marriage vows in a solemn ceremony.
             Everyone was so happy that after 25 years of delay, Mr. Estrada
                                 finally made his full surrender to the Lord.
                                 "Now I can be the priest and leader in my
                                 family," he smiled.

               A Pastoral Christ




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Psalm 23; John 10:1-5, 11-
15.

     MEMORY TEXT: "I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep
     and my sheep know me" (John 10:14, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Psalm 23 is a psalm of comfort and trust.
Spoken from the perspective of the sheep, it is a reminder to meditate
upon God's constant presence and care for us, His sheep. When we
recognize Jesus as our Shepherd, we know our lives are in the hands of
One who willingly died for us.

   JESUS, THE GOOD SHEPHERD. How beautiful are the com-
parisons of the good shepherd to our Saviour, Jesus. As sheep are
dependent upon the shepherd to supply all their needs, so Christ
makes provisions to fulfill our needs, both physical and spiritual.
   Sheep are followers, not leaders, so the shepherd leads them in
right paths. We too need the guidance of God as we face difficulties
and times of decision. And even when we face death, it is with the
assurance of the protection, guidance, and comfort of our Lord.
   The Good Shepherd shelters us from the dangers and pitfalls we
encounter. We live with the assurance that as we continue to follow
Jesus, He will dwell with us now and throughout eternity.
   "A little girl, not yet fully prepared, got up to recite Psalm 23 in a
church-school program. She didn't recite the psalm as most of us
know it, but what she said is true: 'The Lord is my Shepherd; that's all
I want.' "—Charles L. Wallis, ed., A Treasury of Sermon Illustrations
(New York: Abingdon-Cokesbury Press, 1950), p. 145. Is He all you
want?

THE SHEPHERD PROVIDES FOR OUR NEEDS (Ps. 23:1-3).

   David wrote about the shepherd's care for the sheep from his own
experience in tending the flocks of his family (1 Sam. 16:11) and from
his experience of knowing God as his Shepherd. David knew what
dangers the sheep faced and how to offset these dangers (1 Sam.
17:34, 35). From this background, he was able to understand our
human need for a caring Shepherd to watch over us and guide us.

  For what specific needs of the sheep does the shepherd make
provision? Ps. 23:1-3.


   "The wise shepherd knows that the sheep must not drink when it is
hot, neither when its stomach is filled with undigested grass."—
Charles L. Allen, God's Psychiatry (Westwood, N.J.: Fleming H.
Revell Company, 1953), p. 18. So the shepherd finds a pasture of
tender grass where the sheep can digest their food undisturbed.
    Because sheep are fearful of rapidly moving water, the shepherd
then leads them to a quiet pool from which they can quench their
thirst. "The shepherd does not laugh at the sheep's fears. . . . If there
are no still waters available, while the sheep are resting, the shepherd
will gather up stones to fashion a dam across a small stream to form a
pool from which even the tiniest lamb may drink without fear."
—Allen, pp. 19, 20.
    The New English Bible translates verse 3: "He renews life within
me, and for his name's sake guides me in the right path." When the
sheep are tired or in need of guidance, the shepherd leads them in the
right paths. How willing the shepherd is to provide the guidance the
sheep need. And yet because they can see only a short distance, it is
not difficult for a sheep to wander down an unfamiliar path and
become lost, as the parable of the lost sheep reminds us (Luke 15:4-7).
It is then the shepherd's responsibility to find the sheep and return it to
 the flock.

   Compare the sheep's eyesight to some people's spiritual eye-
sight. In what ways can we all be spiritually nearsighted? Prov.
14:12; Luke 12:16-34.


    How does the shepherd's meeting the physical needs of the
 sheep compare to the way God meets the physical and spiritual
 needs you experience? Are you able to testify to your Sabbath
 School class of God's daily provision for your needs?


                                                                        57
Monday                                          November 13
THE GUIDANCE OF THE SHEPHERD (Ps. 23:4).

   Of what is the sheep not fearful as it walks through "the valley
of the shadow of death"? What is the source of its assurance
during this journey? Ps. 23:4.


    "The Basque Sheepherder describes an actual Valley of the Shadow
of Death. . . . It leads from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea and is a very
narrow and dangerous pathway through the mountain range. The path
is rough, and there is danger that a sheep may fall at any moment to its
death."—Allen, p. 26.

  When have you experienced walking through "the valley of the
shadow of death"? In what ways were you conscious of God's
presence?


   "Thy rod and thy staff." In caring for the flock, no shepherd
would be without these two implements. "Whereas the rod conveys
the concept of authority, of power, of discipline, of defense against
danger, the word 'staff' speaks of all that is longsuffering and kind."
—Phillip Keller, A Shepherd Looks at Psalm 23 (Grand Rapids, Mich.:
Zondervan Publishing House, 1970), p. 99.
   When natural predators approach, the shepherd uses his rod to
protect both himself and the sheep. The shepherd also uses the rod
when a rebellious sheep needs discipline or when he needs to examine
the sheep for injuries. As the instrument of compassion, the staff is
used by the shepherd to provide direction, to draw the sheep together
or to himself, and to rescue them from danger.

  Summarize how each of the following verses enlarges our un-
derstanding of God's protection, care, and guidance.

Ps. 119:105


Isa. 43:2, 3


Rom. 8:32


    How have you responded when God has used the "rod" and
 the "staff" in your spiritual growth and development?

PROTECTIVE ACTIVITIES OF THE SHEPHERD (Ps. 23:5).

   List additional ways the shepherd provides for the needs of the
sheep. Ps. 23:5.


   "In the pastures of the Holy Land grew poisonous plants which
were fatal to the sheep if eaten. Also, there were plants whose sharp
thorns would penetrate the soft noses of the sheep and cause ugly
sores."—Allen, p. 30.
   When preparing a place for the sheep to graze, the shepherd needed
to be especially vigilant. This "table" from which the sheep would eat
might present dangers for which they were unprepared. The shepherd
traveled ahead of the flock to remove these dangers before the sheep
arrived.
   If there were poisonous plants, he pulled them up and destroyed
them. If predators lurked, he would remove or kill them. Thus, when
the sheep arrived at the pasture, the shepherd had "prepared a table for
them in the presence of their enemies."

   Protective oil. Because the nose of a sheep can be easily injured or
infected by insects, the shepherd used oil as a healing and protective
agent. When flies were present and caused distress among the sheep,
this oil would be most soothing. "Once the oil had been applied to the
sheep's head there was an immediate change in behavior. Gone was
the aggravation; gone the frenzy; gone the irritability and the restless-
ness. Instead, the sheep would start to feed quietly again, then soon lie
down in peaceful contentment"— Keller, p. 116.

   What do the following texts contribute to your understanding
of God's willingness to give you a "cup that runneth over"?

Matt. 7:7-11


Eph. 3:17-21


Phil. 4:19


    When have you recognized that God has gone before you to
 prepare the way? What dangers are present for which you real-
 ize the need to pray for God's protection?


                                                                      59

BLESSINGS OF THE SHEPHERD (Ps. 23:6).

   Note how David's words of praise, "surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life" (Ps. 23:6), are a summary
of verses 1-5.


   Meditating on all the benefits the sheep receive from the shepherd
causes David to praise God for His goodness and mercy. David's
early experience as a shepherd helped him to appreciate all God's
tender care.

   What do you learn about the goodness and mercy of God from
a study of the following texts?

Exod. 34:5-7


Psalm 107


Isa. 63:7-9


Rom. 2:4


   It is helpful to share with one another the many ways God ex-
presses His goodness and mercy toward us. Then He will strengthen
our own faith in Him, and we will become more conscious of the ways
He is present in our lives.
   "The house of the Lord." When David refers to the "house of the
Lord," his mind is turned toward the tabernacle (Ps. 27:4). His great
desire is to dwell with God in His Holy Sanctuary for all his days. And
there is no better place for the Christian to dwell, for it is here we see the
God of grace revealing His love in the plan of salvation.

    Describe how the words of Revelation 7:15-17 reflect the
 message of Psalm 23.
    "The ways of Providence will be made clear; the mysteries of
 grace through Christ will be unfolded. That which the mind
 cannot now grasp, which is hard to be understood, will be
 explained."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commen-
 tary, vol. 6, p. 1091.

Thursday                                        November 16
JESUS, THE GOOD SHEPHERD (John 10:1-5, 11-15).

   In his Gospel, the apostle John records the familiar story in which
Jesus applies the imagery of the shepherd to Himself. He reminds His
listeners that a difference exists between the attitude of the Good
Shepherd and the thieves and hirelings.

  What contrasts does Jesus present between the Good Shepherd
and the thief and hireling? John 10:1-5, 11-15.


   "It is not the fear of punishment, or the hope of everlasting reward,
that leads the disciples of Christ to follow Him. They behold the
Saviour's matchless love, revealed throughout His pilgrimage on earth,
from the manger of Bethlehem to Calvary's cross, and the sight of
Him attracts, it softens and subdues the soul. Love awakens in the
heart of the beholders. They hear His voice, and they follow Him."
—The Desire of Ages, p. 480.
   Just as Psalm 23 reminds us of the tender care of our heavenly
Shepherd, so this picture of Jesus as the Good Shepherd is filled with
assurances of His love for the sheep. While not using the word grace,
both passages of Scripture provide us with pictures of God's grace in
action. His grace guides us, protects us, and "daily loads us with
benefits" (Ps. 68:19, NKJV).

   How is the relationship of the shepherd and the sheep de-
scribed in John 10:1-5, 11-15?


   "Of all creatures the sheep is one of the most timid and helpless,
and in the East the shepherd's care for his flock is untiring and
incessant. . . .
   "As the shepherd leads his flock over the rocky hills, through forest
and wild ravines, to grassy nooks by the riverside; as he watches them
on the mountains through the lonely night, shielding from robbers,
caring tenderly for the sickly and feeble, his life comes to be one with
theirs. A strong and tender attachment unites him to the objects of his
care. However large the flock, the shepherd knows every sheep. Every
one has its name, and responds to the name at the shepherd's call."
—The Desire of Ages, pp. 478, 479.

    In your experience, how have you come to know the voice of
 the Shepherd? What are some of the false shepherds that seek to
 draw you away from Jesus? How might you learn to follow the
 Good Shepherd more closely?

                                                                      61
Friday                                           November 17
FURTHER STUDY: How does the parable of the lost sheep relate to
the criticism that Jesus ate with sinners? How does this parable exhibit
God's grace? (See Luke 15:1-7.)
   Also read "This Man Receiveth Sinners" in Christ's Object Les-
sons, pp. 185-197. Reflect on the way Jesus found you when you were
lost.

   "Every soul is as fully known to Jesus as if he were the only one for
whom the Saviour died. The distress of every one touches His heart. . . .
He came to draw all men unto Himself. He bids them, 'Follow Me,'
and His Spirit moves upon their hearts to draw them to come to Him.
Many refuse to be drawn. Jesus knows who they are. He also knows
who gladly hear His call, and are ready to come under His pastoral
care. He says, 'My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they
follow Me.' He cares for each one as if there were not another on the
face of the earth."—The Desire of Ages, p. 480.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. List the areas of your life in which you most need the care
     and guidance of the Shepherd. What one thing can you do
     this next week to let Jesus meet these needs?

     2. How does Psalm 51 contribute to your understanding of the
        phrase "He restoreth my soul"? When have you felt a need
        for restoration? How did God help?

     3. In today's society the imagery of the shepherd caring for
        the sheep is not as familiar as it was when David wrote
        Psalm 23. Name current relationships you have that pro-
        vide this same sense of caring and guidance.

     4. How does Psalm 23 contribute to your understanding of
        God's grace? Compare Psalm 23 with Isaiah 53.

SUMMARY: How often during periods of stress, turmoil, and loss
we turn to the familiar words of Psalm 23. The imagery of the shep-
herd tenderly caring for the needs of his sheep assures us of God's
grace in our lives. Whether our needs are physical, emotional, or
spiritual, the psalm inspires us with confidence in God's ability to
provide.
   Knowing that Jesus identified Himself as the Shepherd reminds us
of the close bond that exists between the shepherd and the sheep. The
Good Shepherd is now clearly seen as One who walked before us and
laid down His life for our eternal salvation. What a joy to know that
we can trust our lives to One who cares so deeply.

                                      Rose Otis

            In a miracle, or rather, a series of miracles, the women of the
        East Java Confeence in Indonesia planted an Adventist church in
        Ngawi (NOW-ee), a city of more than a million, where 95 percent
        of the population was Muslim.
            With funds from Global Mission and the General Conference
        Office of Women's Ministries, the women bought property and
        refurbished an old garage to create a lovely chapel that seats 275.
        For 18-20 months more than 150 women worked for one to six
        weeks in outreach programs. The women lived in a garage behind
        the church, sleeping on mats and hanging their clothes on ropes
        around the room. They cooked their meals while squatting at a
        little stove, and washed their dishes under a spigot.
            When the church renovation was complete the women invited
        Ngawi city officials to help celebrate the dedication of the reno-
        vated "meeting hall." They had feared calling it a church, because
        of prejudice. But the women were surprised when officials from
        the mayor's office congratulated the women on having "built such
        a lovely church in our city."
            Soon after the dedication the women hosted a stop-smoking
        clinic, and the city's director of health completed the class suc-
        cessfully. When he told the mayor and other employees what he
        had learned about the harmful effects of secondary tobacco smoke,
        the mayor moved to ban smoking in the city government offices.
            Two floods, the worst in 50 years, devastated parts of Ngawi.
        ADRA provided funds, and the women's-ministries team bought
        clothing, bedding, and staples for flood victims. Their humanitar-
        ian efforts won many friends for the church.
            One day Mrs. Ellen Missah, women's-ministries coordinator of
        the the East Java Conference, was called into the mayor's office.
                               Knowing that prejudice existed against the
                               church, she wondered what the mayor wanted.
                               But when she arrived, he told her, "All our
                               citizens need what you are teaching."

           An Inclusive Saviour




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Isa. 56:3-8; Matt. 21:12-
16.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Even them will I bring to my holy moun-
     tain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt
     offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar;
     for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people"
     (Isaiah 56:7).

   KEY THOUGHT: In cleansing the temple, Jesus reveals that His
grace extends to all who desire to worship Him.

   JESUS OPENS WORSHIP TO ALL WHO WILL COME. When
Jesus came to the temple, He became angry to find an exclusive
system that barred many from participating in worship. Jesus could
not allow the merchandising in the temple courts to detract from the
sacredness of the worship experience. Anything that would prohibit
inclusive worship He must deal with.
   Today, divisions of race, gender, religion, social and economic
status pervade our world. What can we learn from Jesus about appro-
priate attitudes toward those who differ from us? How can the church
model an attitude of inclusiveness toward all who would come to
worship? How can we structure our worship services so those from
different backgrounds or cultures will not feel excluded? What can we
do to make our church "an house of prayer for all people" (Isa. 56:7)?
These are important questions that require thoughtful, considerate
answers. As you study this week's lesson, ask yourself what you can
do on an individual basis to make your church more inclusive without
compromising the church's doctrinal distinctives.

AN HOUSE OF PRAYER FOR ALL PEOPLE (Isa. 56:5, 7).

   By the time Jesus came to earth, Israel had lost sight of God's
purpose for the temple and its services. An attitude of religious elitism
had replaced Israel's mission to be "a light to the Gentiles" (Isa. 49:6).

   Describe how the following texts contribute to an understand-
ing of God's purpose for the temple.

1 Kings 8:41-43


Isa. 56:3-8


Micah 4:1, 2


   The temple services were to teach the plan of salvation to those
who did not know God. And the Israelites were to share their experi-
ences of God's love and grace. In this way, those who did not know
God would learn about His covenant and devote themselves to it.
   "Had Israel been faithful, men from all nations would have come to
Jerusalem to worship God."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 300.

   What would the "son of the stranger" know of God's grace
after worshiping in the temple? Isa. 56:5, 7.


    God's inclusive nature is evident in the blessings showered upon
the children of strangers who learned to worship Him. Participation in
the temple services would replace their experience of exclusion.
    Some wished to separate and divide. But God wanted His temple to
be a place where Jews and Gentiles worshiped together. "Had a Gen-
tile presumed to enter the inner enclosure, he would have desecrated
the temple, and would have paid the penalty with his life. But Jesus,
the originator of the temple and its service, drew the Gentiles to Him
by the tie of human sympathy, while His divine grace brought to them
the salvation which the Jews rejected."—The Desire of Ages, p. 193.

    How can you represent God's inclusive nature in your deal-
 ings with those who do not share your beliefs?




                                                                        65
Monday                                          November 20
THE NEED FOR CLEANSING (Matt. 21:12, 13).

    God desired that the temple would draw all people to worship Him.
But Jesus realized that the people were not responding to this purpose.
"In the temple at Jerusalem a low wall separated the outer court from
all other portions of the sacred building. Upon this wall were inscrip-
tions in different languages, stating that none but Jews were allowed
to pass this boundary."—The Desire of Ages, p. 193.

   What was the condition of the temple prior to its cleansing by
Jesus? Matt. 21:12, 13.


   Temple authorities sanctioned the activity these verses describe for
two reasons. First of all, the worshipers who came from long distances
would find it difficult to transport their sacrifices. And second, the
authorities made a comfortable profit. But all involved showed "they
had a gross misconception of the character of God and of the require-
ments He made of those who love and serve Him."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 5, p. 471.

  How were the temple leaders fulfilling the prophecies of the
Old Testament? Micah 6:6-8; Ps. 40:6-8.


   A form of worship. Through the prophetic voice God had warned
His people that the mere bringing of sacrifices was not His desire. The
sacrifices were to be an outward sign of the inward condition of the
repentant heart.
   "Numerous ceremonies were enjoined upon the people without the
proper instruction as to their import. The worshipers offered their
sacrifices without understanding that they were typical of the only
perfect Sacrifice. And among them, unrecognized and unhonored,
stood the One symbolized by all their service. He had given directions
in regard to the offerings. He understood their symbolical value, and
He saw that they were now perverted and misunderstood. Spiritual
worship was fast disappearing. No link bound the priests and rulers to
their God."—The Desire of Ages, p. 157.
   God's desire is the same today as when Jesus cleansed the temple.
He would have us replace formalism and routine with worship that
comes from a heart full of thanks for His gift of grace.

   If Jesus were to speak to you about the way you worship God,
 what would be His message?

JESUS CLEANSES THE TEMPLE (Mark 11:15, 16).

   The need for Jesus to cleanse the temple near the end of His earthly
ministry is surprising when we remember that He had cleansed it
earlier in His ministry (John 2:12-22). But instead of learning from
their previous encounter with Jesus, the temple leaders had become
even more involved in unholy activities.

 What actions did Jesus take to restore the sanctity of the temple?
Mark 11:15, 16.


  Jesus would not allow the actions of the buyers, sellers, and
moneychangers to continue. He must stop their exploitation of true
worshipers.
  For many, the temple courts had become the shortcut for their
business errands, and these people Jesus would not allow to carry their
common vessels through the sacred courts.

  Summarize the claim Jesus made about His relationship to the
temple when He quoted Isaiah 56:7. Matt. 21:13.


   Jesus' anger against the desecrators ran deep because they were
trampling upon the very sacredness and holiness of God's house.
They had lost sight of His holy character and the recognition of His
sacred presence within the temple.
   Read Jeremiah 7:1-11. Jeremiah's words were appropriate to
the circumstances of Jesus' day. Throughout history the worship of
God has been in danger of being corrupted. Just as in the days of
Jeremiah and Jesus, so we are in danger of falling into a form of
worship without the Spirit and power of God. It is only through close
fellowship with Jesus Christ that our worship comes from the heart.
   "Evidently the false prophets maintained that God would never
allow the Temple, His dwelling place, to fall into profane hands; that
the presence of that Temple in Jerusalem would serve as a kind of
charm to protect the city and its inhabitants. . . . Similarly today many
church members trust in external church connections for salvation.
They are more ready for outward religious activities than for the inner
preparation of the heart."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 387.

   How can you make your own activities in God's house more
 worshipful? What connection do you see between your state of
 mind and the meaningfulness of your worship?


                                                                      67
Wednesday                                         November 22
THE PRIESTS AND SCRIBES RESPOND (Matt. 21:15,16).

    Jesus directed His anger toward the ones who, by their activities,
were interfering with those who wanted to worship God. His words to
them, "My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made
it a den of thieves" (Matt. 21:13), struck the chief priests and scribes
deeply. Jesus had unmasked their use of God's house for their own
profit.

  Summarize the religious leaders' response to Jesus' words of
rebuke. Matt. 21:15; Luke 19:47, 48.


   Instead of allowing the words and actions of Jesus to impact their
hearts and bring about a change in their lives, these leaders further
developed their plans to destroy Jesus. Yet even in this they felt
frustration over their immediate inability to act, because of the peoples'
attentiveness to Jesus.

  How did the chief priests and scribes attempt to turn Jesus'
wrath away from themselves? Matt. 21:16.


   In an attempt to mask their own guilt, the chief priests and scribes
sought to draw Jesus' condemnation away from their own actions to
the children in the temple.
   "The sound of these happy, unrestrained voices was an offense to
the rulers of the temple. They set about putting a stop to such demon-
strations. They represented to the people that the house of God was
desecrated by the feet of the children and the shouts of rejoicing.
Finding that their words made no impression on the people, the rulers
appealed to Christ."—The Desire of Ages, p. 592.
   The priests' and scribes' perceptions of the workings of God were
so distorted that what was an honor to God, they viewed with indigna-
tion. Thus they continued to justify their own unholy actions.
   As the religious leaders in Jesus' day were blinded to His true
mission and the genuine praise offered by those remaining in the
temple, it is also possible for us to be self-deceived in our beliefs. Our
only safeguard is to be open-minded in allowing God to speak to us
through the Bible and to be receptive to honest observations from
fellow Christians.

    What occasions have there been in your life when you pre-
 ferred not to hear words of correction from God? How was God
 able to break through your resistance?

THE TEMPLE RESTORED (Matt. 21:14-16).

  How did Jesus respond to the blind, the lame, and the children
who were in the temple? Matt. 21:14, 15.


   It is apparent that not everyone fled from the presence of Jesus
when He cleansed the temple. Those people stayed whose hearts'
desire was to worship God. Unlike the religious leaders, Jesus would
not turn them away. "Those who call themselves His followers may
despise and shun the outcast ones; but no circumstance of birth or
nationality, no condition of life, can turn away His love from the
children of men."—The Desire of Ages, p. 194.
   These people, in turn, did not abandon Jesus. They looked to Him
not only for restoration of true temple worship but for physical heal-
ing and restoration. The children were drawn to Jesus and found
themselves filled with the praise and hosannas due the Son of David.

 How were the children fulfilling the prophecy quoted by Jesus?
Matt. 21:16.


   "Prophecy had foretold that Christ should be proclaimed as king,
and that word must be fulfilled. The priests and rulers of Israel refused
to herald His glory, and God moved upon the children to be His
witnesses."—The Desire of Ages, p. 593. The day before, the multi-
tude that preceded Jesus into Jerusalem had declared His praise.
Again in the temple God inspired the people present to proclaim,
"Hosanna to the Son of David."

  How does the cleansed and restored temple now reveal God's
purpose for the temple? Hosea 6:6.


   The prophet Hosea states well God's desire for the worship of His
people. Through His cleansing of the temple, Jesus revealed that the
mere ritualistic offering of sacrifices was not God's intent. Jesus
revealed what it means to show mercy and compassion, the true intent
of worship. Organization in worship services is essential, but unless
the services facilitate God's direct access to human hearts, their pri-
mary purpose is not achieved.

   Have some elements of your worship become mere rituals?
 How can your worship be more expressive of your desire to
 show mercy and compassion?

                                                                       69

FURTHER STUDY: What can we learn about true worship from the
following verses? Ps. 46:10; 77:12; 95:1, 2; 96:8.
   Read "In His Temple" and "The Temple Cleansed Again" in The
Desire of Ages, chapters 16 and 52, pp. 154-166, 589-600. List the
lessons about true worship that you gain from reading these chapters.

   "To the humble, believing soul, the house of God on earth is the
gate of heaven. The song of praise, the prayer, the words spoken by
Christ's representatives, are God's appointed agencies to prepare a
people for the church above, for that loftier worship into which there
can enter nothing that defileth. . . .
   "Nothing that is sacred, nothing that pertains to the worship of
God, should be treated with carelessness or indifference."—Testimo-
nies, vol. 5, p. 491.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What words of thanks would you like to share about the
     inclusive nature of God's salvation revealed in His words
     "Mine house shall be an house of prayer for all people"?

     2. List specific suggestions that would make the worship serv-
        ice in your church more inclusive of all people.

     3. How does the following statement aid your understanding
        of God's purpose for the temple?

       "From eternal ages it was God's purpose that every created
       being, from the bright and holy seraph to man, should be a
       temple for the indwelling of the Creator. . . . God designed
       that the temple at Jerusalem should be a continual witness
       to the high destiny open to every soul."—The Desire of
       Ages, p. 161.

     4. How can you more effectively be "a temple for the indwell-
        ing of the Creator"?

SUMMARY: God's desire was that the services of the temple would
reveal His character and plan of salvation for humanity. But through
the misrepresentations of the religious leaders, Israel had lost sight of
this plan. Jesus' cleansing of the temple was one way in which He
sought to return the worship of God to its rightful place.
   Our goal in worship should always be to uplift Jesus Christ as the
Saviour of the world and to foster an atmosphere of openness so that
our churches will be houses "of prayer for all people."

            Women's Ministries in Indonesia had taken on an enormous
        challenge: Raise up a church in the Muslim city of Ngawi. They
        renovated an old building and began to hold outreach programs.
            The women sponsored a Vacation Bible School, and 125 chil-
        dren, most from Muslim homes, came daily to learn Scripture and
        sing Christian songs. On graduation night the proud parents sat in
        the audience as their children, wearing little crowns, sang "Allah
        loves the little children, all the children of the world."
            But when the children took their graduation certificates home,
        Muslim parents discovered a picture of Jesus on it. This angered
        them. Then, some children refused to go to the mosque to pray,
        insisting that they kneel by their beds and pray to Jesus instead.
        Muslim parents went to the mayor to demand that the Adventists
        be closed down. "If you don't do it we will," they threatened.
            The phone rang in the home of Ellen Missah, East Java Confer-
        ence director of women's ministries. "The chairman for religion
        in East Java would like to see you in his office Monday morning,"
        a voice on the other end said. Over the weekend Pastor and Mrs.
        Missah pleaded with God to intervene. On Monday morning as
        they drove the four hours to Ngawi, they rehearsed answers to
        questions they would likely be asked. Their greatest fear was that
        after coming so far with the program, the government might close
        it down.
            When the Missahs arrived they were prepared to answer for the
         Vacation Bible School, but the head of the Ngawi department of
         religion defended the women's program. "This office represents
         all recognized religions in Indonesia, not just Islam," the man
         reminded those present. "The Seventh-day Adventist Church is a
         recognized religion in Indonesia. The women have gotten the
         permission to carry out all of their activities. They have been a
                               blessing to our people." Surprised by this
                               response, the East Java director of religion
                               asked why the meeting had even been called,
                               and dismissed the Missahs. Again, God had
                               intervened.

          A Genealogy of Grace




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 1:1-16, 20, 21.

     MEMORY TEXT: "She will give birth to a son, and you are to
     give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from
     their sins" (Matthew 1:21, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: We can clearly see God's grace in the lives of
the people Matthew includes in his genealogy of Jesus. In fact, it
would seem that God has gone out of His way to assure us that His
grace extends even to those we would consider the worst of sinners.

   JESUS' FAMILY TREE. The reconstruction of family genealo-
gies is an important activity for some families. Tracing back through
family history provides interesting and helpful information and can
give family members a sense of identity. But what about those ances-
tors whose lives are less honorable than most? Might there be a desire
to pluck some of these more "colorful" individuals from the family
tree?
   God inspired Matthew to trace the lineage of Jesus from Abraham
through his legal line to Joseph, Jesus' earthly "father." Matthew
includes some individuals we might have left out. Yet by including
these people, God reminds us of the words He spoke to Samuel, "God
sees not as man sees, for man looks at the outward appearance, but the
Lord looks at the heart" (1 Sam. 16:7, NASB).
   As you study this week's lesson, pray that God will help you to
value people more for what is in their hearts than for their outward
appearance.

JESUS, SAVIOUR OF HIS PEOPLE (Matt. 1:1-17).

  The name Jesus means "Jehovah is salvation." In his introductory
chapter, Matthew reveals to us God's plan for the salvation of sinners.
He included in his genealogy persons whose lives reveal the grace of
God at work in sinful humanity.

   How do the following texts reveal the purpose of Jesus' mission
to this earth?

Matt. 9:12, 13


Luke 19:10


1 Tim. 1:15


   The mission of Jesus. Remember that the Jewish nation was
looking for a messiah who would release them from Roman bondage.
But when Jesus came He revealed that His mission was far different
from what His people expected.

   As you read Matthew 1:1-17, note any individuals whom you
are surprised to find listed. What is Matthew trying to say to us by
including these people in the genealogy of Jesus?


   Matthew reminds us that Jesus' human ancestors were sinners who
needed grace. Their stories reveal God's grace at work in restoring
broken lives. The history of their lives reminds us that Jesus is the
Saviour of all.
   "How devastating this genealogy is when we see it for what God
intended it to be! It strikes a blow in the face of legalism, self-
righteousness, and human religion. It underscores the truth that Jesus
identified with sinners. It puts a holy spotlight on God's grace. . . .
   "The same grace that was evident in the genealogy is active today,
and the same Jesus is saving His people from their sins. No sin, no
matter how heinous, puts sinners beyond His reach."—John F. MacArthur,
Jr., God With Us (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan Publishing House,
1989), p. 35.

    What response do you want to make to a God who is willing to
 identify Himself with sinners in order to save them?

                                                                     73

ABRAHAM, FRIEND OF GOD (Gen. 12:1-3, 10-20).

   Matthew begins his genealogy identifying Jesus as "the son of
Abraham" (Matt. 1:1). In so doing, Matthew seeks to establish the
identity of Jesus, the Messiah, as heir to the promises God made to
Abraham. This was important to the Jews who looked askance at
impure blood lines.

   What promise did God make to Abraham, and how was it
fulfilled? Gen. 12:1-3; 22:15-18; Gal. 3:8, 16.


   It was in this promise that Abraham believed and trusted, a promise
that included forgiveness of sin. "All further promises to the patri-
archs and to Israel either clarified or amplified the promise of salva-
tion offered the entire human race in the first promise made to Abram."
—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 294.

  What do the following incidents in the life of Abraham reveal
about his ability to trust God?

Gen. 12:10-20


Gen. 16:1-4


Gen. 20:1-18


   God did not base His promises to Abraham upon Abraham's faith-
fulness, but upon His own faithfulness. Scripture even refers to Abraham
as "the Friend of God" (James 2:23) and includes him in Hebrews
11:8-11, 17-19 as a pillar of faith. God never stopped revealing Him-
self to Abraham as the God of grace and forgiveness.
   "Faith may be genuine and yet prove to be weak in moments of
stress and perplexity. A vigorous faith will cling to the promise, and to
that alone, trusting entirely to God for its accomplishment. Such was
Abram's faith, except upon three or four brief occasions, throughout a
long and eventful life. God had no need of Abram's devices for the
accomplishment of His promise. Trust and obedience alone were
required."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 317.

    What do you most appreciate about God's dealings with His
 friend Abraham?

ISAAC AND JACOB REVEAL GOD'S GRACE (Gen. 24:62-67;
32, 33).

  Review the following events in the life of Isaac, and identify
what each event reveals about his character.

Gen. 24:62-67


Gen. 25:21, 28


Gen. 26:6-11


   In the life of Isaac we see again one who, though blessed by God, at
times revealed human weakness. God continued to reveal His grace by
accepting Isaac and renewing His covenant promises with him (Gen.
26:2-5; 26:24, 25).

   God also revealed His grace to Jacob. As Jacob anticipated his
return home and his encounter with Esau, anxiety overcame him.
How did God reveal His presence and protection to Jacob before
his meeting with Esau? How did Jacob's night of wrestling with
God result in an attitude of trust and confidence? Genesis 32, 33.


   Jacob first recognized God's presence through "the angels of God"
who met him as he traveled with his family (Gen. 32:1). However, as
he received the message that Esau was approaching with a band of
soldiers, Jacob's heart filled with fear. He prayed to God about what
seemed to be a hopeless situation.
   Soon he found himself in hand-to-hand combat with one he be-
lieved to be an enemy. "Helpless and unworthy, he pleaded God's
promise of mercy to the repentant sinner. That promise was his assur-
ance that God would pardon and accept him. Sooner might heaven and
earth pass than that word could fail; and it was this that sustained him
through that fearful conflict."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 201.

   "Yet Jacob's history is an assurance that God will not cast off
 those who have been betrayed into sin, but who have returned
 unto Him with true repentance."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
 pp. 202, 203.



                                                                     75

GOD'S GRACE TO WOMEN (Gen. 38:6-26).

   In his genealogy of Jesus, Matthew includes four women. While we
might expect the names of such prominent women as Sarah, Rebekah,
and Rachel, these are not the women Matthew chose. Instead, he
points us to the lives of Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba.

     Summarize the background and character of these women:

Tamar: Gen. 38:6-26


Rahab: Joshua 2:1-21; 6:17, 22, 23, 25


Ruth: Ruth 1-4


Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah: 2 Sam. 11:2-5, 26, 27


   God's grace revealed. The inclusion of these women in Matthew's
genealogy most likely raised questions in the minds of Matthew's
Jewish readers. Why would God list these women in a genealogy of
His Son? "Because the people in the Messianic genealogy are not on
display; God's grace is."—MacArthur, p. 34. Their inclusion is proof
that Jesus is the sinner's friend (Luke 7:34) and that He did not come
to "call the righteous, but sinners" (Matt. 9:13).
   The lives of these women are an example of God's desire to break
down the prejudice that views Him as the Saviour of those only who
are thought to deserve His grace. We see in the stories of these women
God's willingness to include in His kingdom even the most broken
outcasts of society.
   "With the exception of Ruth, scandals were attached to the names
of all these women. A merely human historian might have chosen to
pass over their names in silence for fear that the honor of the Messiah
be tarnished. . . . [But] Matthew quotes the Master as saying [to the
Pharisees] that He came not 'to call the righteous, but sinners to
repentance' (ch. 9:13)."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 278.

    Describe your view of God's willingness to include these four
 women in the genealogy of Jesus. How might you use their inclu-
 sion in Matthew's genealogy to encourage people who feel their
 lives are too full of sin for God to accept them?

DAVID'S EXPERIENCE OF GRACE (2 Sam. 12:1-13).

   Matthew reminds us again of God's grace when he states in his
genealogy, "And to David was born Solomon by her who had been the
wife of Uriah" (Matt. 1:6, NASB). While Matthew could have easily
overlooked David's sin with Bathsheba, he gave it prominent mention
so again we can understand God's mercy toward sinners.

   How did David compound his sin of adultery with Bathsheba?
2 Sam. 11:6-17.


    When Bathsheba sent word to King David that their adulterous
liaison had resulted in the conception of a child, David did not turn to
God in repentance and sorrow for his sin. Instead he engaged in
behavior that he hoped would keep his adultery a secret.
    He needed to see and acknowledge the true nature of his actions and
return to the God of grace, who would willingly forgive and cleanse.

   Describe the method God used to confront David with the sin-
fulness of his actions. 2 Sam. 12:1-13.


   "For the sake of Israel also, there was a necessity for God to
interpose. As time passed on, David's sin toward Bathsheba became
known, and suspicion was excited that he had planned the death of
Uriah. The Lord was dishonored. He had favored and exalted David,
and David's sin misrepresented the character of God, and cast re-
proach upon His name."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 720. As a result
of Nathan's intervention, David realized the seriousness of his sin.
   Note how Psalm 51 shows us the depth of David's repentance after
Nathan confronted him.
   When we acknowledge and accept responsibility for our sin, God
willingly forgives and cleanses. We then experience the joy of restored
fellowship with Him.

     How does Psalm 51 express your repentance and desire for
 God's cleansing from sin?
     "Repentance includes sorrow for sin and a turning away from
 it. We shall not renounce sin unless we see its sinfulness; until we
 turn away from it in heart, there will be no real change in the
 life."—Steps to Christ, p. 23.

FURTHER STUDY: Study the lives of other people listed in Matthew's
genealogy, and reflect on how God has revealed His grace through
them. You might include Judah, Solomon, several of the kings of
Judah, and Zerubbabel.
   The following selections from Ellen G. White's writings deal with
some of the names found in Matthew's genealogy: Patriarchs and
Prophets, "The Call of Abraham," pp. 125-131; "The Night of
Wrestling," pp. 195-203; "The Last Years of David," pp. 746-755.

   "The children of Israel were to occupy all the territory which God
appointed them. Those nations that rejected the worship and service of
the true God were to be dispossessed. But it was God's purpose that by
the revelation of His character through Israel men should be drawn
unto Him. To all the world the gospel invitation was to be given. . . .
All who, like Rahab the Canaanite, and Ruth the Moabitess, turned
from idolatry to the worship of the true God, were to unite themselves
with His chosen people. As the numbers of Israel increased they were
to enlarge their borders, until their kingdom should embrace the world.
   "God desired to bring all peoples under His merciful rule. He
desired that the earth should be filled with joy and peace. He created
man for happiness, and He longs to fill human hearts with the peace of
heaven."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 290.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What experiences have led you to recognize God's grace
     toward you?

     2. After studying this lesson, has your opinion changed re-
        garding Matthew's wisdom in including certain question-
        able characters in his list of Jesus' ancestors? If so, how?

     3. What do you think of a God who includes ex-adulterers,
        prostitutes, idolators, and deceivers as "His people"?

     4. Summarize the message of Psalm 51, expressing your re-
        pentance for sin and confidence in God's forgiveness.

SUMMARY: In his genealogy, Matthew has opened the door for a
new understanding of what it means to be God's people. Through the
lives of those included in his listing, we see a God who looks upon the
heart, not upon outward appearances. We can be confident that, just as
God showed His grace to these erring humans, He will reveal His
grace to us.

          Indonesian Women Plant a Church:
                     The Parade
                            Rose Otis

   They targeted Moslem Ngawi to plant a church. They remod-
eled a building, held a Vacation Bible School and stop-smoking
clinic. They distributed blankets, clothing, and food to flood vic-
tims, and they had caught the attention of the city. Now it was
time for evangelistic meetings.
   Adventist marching bands paraded through Ngawi's streets
with trumpets blaring and batons held high to herald the meetings.
What a contrast to the scene earlier!
   Some weeks before we had fasted and prayed when the program's
survival was threatened; and even as we flew in to Ngawi, our
believers were praying that the government would issue permits
allowing foreigners to speak at the meetings. Just three days
before the meetings began, officials issued the necessary permits!
   On opening night bicycle rickshaws delivered people to the
church. Traders lined the sidewalks to sell their wares. And every
night the chapel was full, and hundreds watched on closed-circuit
television in the churchyard.
    During the series, two women provided food for the guests.
One woman, Shaundra, told me, "We didn't have a place to cook
or sleep. But a neighbor invited us to use her home. They are
attending the meetings." God had opened the doors of unbeliev-
ers to provide accommodations for these workers.
    On Sabbath 1,000 people crowded into and around the chapel.
But the rows reserved for the baptismal candidates were empty.
Would they come? Would these lifelong Moslems hear the call of
the Saviour-King? Would they accept the love that the women
had shown all these months? Would they accept the gift of
                                          salvation that Jesus
                                          wanted to give them?

              Joseph's Marriage
                   to Mary




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 1:18-25; 2:13-23.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to
     take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her
     is from the Holy Spirit" (Matthew 1:20, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Although initially ready to divorce Mary, Jo-
seph responded to the message of the Lord's angel to marry her
instead. In following God, Joseph became the earthly guardian to the
Son of God.

   JOSEPH, MAN OF CHARACTER. The Bible reveals little about
Joseph, the husband of Mary. Yet from the information we do have
about him, we can see a man who was willing to follow God's leading
and instruction in providing a home for Mary and her child, Jesus.
   From outward appearances, Joseph would have had every reason to
divorce Mary. She was pregnant with a child he knew was not his.
However, his actions show us his compassion and dedication to fol-
lowing God.
   God revealed His grace toward this faithful man by sending a
heavenly messenger to share with him the truth about Mary's preg-
nancy. God continued to communicate with Joseph, giving him guid-
ance about the steps necessary to protect the life of his young charge.
   How willing are you to follow God's instructions? Would you be
as willing as Joseph was, even if God's guidance apparently contra-
dicted the traditional conventions of the society in which you live? As
you study this week's lesson, pray that God will help you develop the
strong faith Joseph exhibited.

JOSEPH'S CHARACTER (Matt. 1:18-25).

  Based on what you read in Matthew 1:18, 19, how would you
describe Joseph's character?


   The Bible tells us very little about Joseph. We know that he was of
the line of David (Luke 2:4) and a carpenter by trade (Matt. 13:55).
Through his actions as recorded in the Bible, we can better understand
his character.
   Because a "just man" was one who carefully observed rabbinical
tradition and the laws of Moses, Joseph may have questioned the
moral soundness of marrying someone who had apparently committed
adultery. But despite this, he decided to do what he believed would be
the least damaging to Mary. He would quietly sign the required legal
papers, but he would not have her judged publicly and stoned. (See
Deut. 22:23, 24.)
   Joseph did not act hastily. After learning of Mary's condition, "he
thought on these things" (Matt. 1:20). Surely he must have con-
sidered all the serious and lasting consequences his actions would
have, not only for him but also for Mary.

  What does Joseph's response to the angel's instruction reveal
about his faith and trust in God's leading? Matt. 1:20-25.


   When the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and
revealed to him that the Child Mary was bearing was the promised
Messiah, he responded quickly and without hesitation. Because of his
love for God and for Mary, he chose to take Mary as his wife. He
decided not to be concerned about his own reputation and the accusa-
tions that would surely arise from his actions. His greatest concern
was to provide a home for Mary and the Child she was carrying.
   In the selection of a man to be the earthly father of Jesus, God did
not choose someone with wealth or fame. More important, God wanted
a man of integrity, compassion, and faith. The presence of these
qualities in the home where Jesus would grow would provide the best
possible atmosphere for His early development. Joseph possessed
these qualities.

    List the character qualities you believe necessary for adults to
 have as they nurture children. Do you feel that any one of these
 is more important than the others? Why?



                                                                    81
Monday                                           December 4
JOSEPH'S DILEMMA (Matt.1:18, 19).

   What was the relationship of Mary and Joseph at the time
Joseph became aware of Mary's pregnancy? What action did he
plan to take? Matt. 1:18, 19.


   A knowledge of the marriage customs of the day will aid us in
understanding the dilemma Joseph faced when he learned that Mary
was expecting a child. Matthew 1:18 tells us that Mary was "es-
poused" or engaged to Joseph. According to Jewish custom, the en-
gagement period was a time in which the couple were bound to each
another, but did not yet live together. Even though the man and
woman were not yet married, this relationship could be terminated
only by divorce. At the end of this time of engagement, the wedding
would take place and the couple would live together as husband and
wife.
   During the time of engagement, it became apparent that Mary was
expecting a child. This must have seemed out of character for her, and
Joseph likely felt bewildered, hurt, and betrayed. He had two options.
He could bring Mary to trial and judgment publicly, or he could
divorce her quietly.
   What a difficult decision for Joseph to make. And yet certainly he
could not marry a woman who was having another man's child.
Should he publicly accuse Mary and bring her into open ridicule and
shame? Or should he simply write a bill of divorce? His desire to do
the kind thing would not allow him to bring her to public disgrace, so
"he had in mind to divorce her quietly" (Matt. 1:19, NIV).

  How does Joseph's decision to divorce Mary quietly reveal his
compassion toward her?


   Whatever decision Joseph made about Mary would bring difficulty
to her. A public trial would lead to open disgrace, humiliation, and
possibly death. A quiet divorce would leave her to rear the Child on
her own, as other men would no doubt be reluctant to marry an
adulteress. Joseph chose what he believed would cause Mary the least
hardship and shame. What he did not know at this point was that God
would unfold His plan to him and bring understanding and hope.

    When have you experienced a time of difficulty in a relation-
 ship with a family member or friend? What means did you use
 to determine God's will for you and for the other person in-
 volved in the situation?

GOD COMMUNICATES WITH JOSEPH (Matt. 1:20-23; 2:13,
19, 20).

  What message did the angel of the Lord bring to Joseph? Matt.
1:20-23. Why do you think God waited until after Joseph had
decided to divorce Mary to reveal the truth about the situation?


    Matthew indicates that, even after deciding to divorce Mary, Jo-
seph continued to think about the situation. It was "while he thought
on these things" (Matt. 1:20) that God sent a heavenly messenger to
speak to him in a dream. What relief and excitement he must have felt
upon learning the truth about Mary's Child.
   It was now time for Joseph to exhibit the same kind of trust that
Mary had shown when the angel came to her with the news that God
had chosen her to bring forth the promised Messiah.

  As God's plan for this family unfolds, how does He continue to
communicate His will to Joseph? Matt. 2:13, 19, 20.


   Certainly a man of Joseph's character spent time in prayer in order
to know God's will for his life and the lives of his family. Just as in
times past when God responded quickly to the prayer of faith, so He
did not leave Joseph in doubt about what he should do. He instructed
him to flee to Egypt in order to avoid Herod's attempt to take Jesus'
life. Then God again communicated with Joseph when it was time for
him to return to the land of Israel.
    God is just as willing to communicate with us as He was to reveal
His will to Joseph. If we will take time to seek His will through prayer
and a study of His word, we will find the guidance and direction we
need in our lives.

   How does God communicate His direction to you when you
 are faced with uncertainty? How has God specifically answered
 your prayers for guidance?

    Meditate on the following: "Whatever our position, we are
 dependent upon God, who holds all destinies in His hands. He
 has appointed us our work, and has endowed us with faculties
 and means for that work. So long as we surrender the will to
 God, and trust in His strength and wisdom, we shall be guided
 in safe paths, to fulfill our appointed part in His great plan."
 —The Desire of Ages, p. 209.


                                                                      83

JOSEPH RESPONDS TO GOD (Matt. 1:24, 25).

   Describe Joseph's response to the communication he received
from God. Matt. 1:24, 25.


   Joseph's response exhibits his deep and abiding trust in God. He
may not have seen all that lay ahead, and yet he did not hesitate to
respond to God's direction. "In this perhaps more than in any other
aspect of the character of Joseph is it apparent why he was suited to be
the earthly protector of Mary and her child Jesus. In taking Mary to his
house, Joseph acted on faith. Such an event as that announced by the
angel was unknown in the annals of human experience, but Joseph
believed that 'with God all things are possible.' "—SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 5, p. 286.

   Note that Joseph's action in following God is an example of
believing the promise: "We know that in all things God works for
the good of those who love him, who have been called according to
his purpose" (Rom. 8:28, NIV).


   God's guidance. Joseph's example of trusting God's plan even
though the future was uncertain is instructive for us. The ability to
trust God for daily guidance comes because His past leading in our
lives gives us confidence that He will continue to guide us today. We
know that God has full knowledge of what is best for us, and we can
live one day at a time trusting the future to His leading.
   "Christ, in His life on earth, made no plans for Himself. He ac-
cepted God's plans for Him, and day by day the Father unfolded His
plans. So should we depend upon God, that our lives may be the
simple outworking of His will. As we commit our ways to Him, He
will direct our steps."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 479.
   Through the record of God's revelation to Joseph of His plan for
the birth of the Messiah, we continue to see God's grace. His commu-
nication with Joseph and His guidance as Joseph makes a crucial
decision about his future relationship with Mary show us God's desire
to be involved in every aspect of our lives, if we will only turn to Him
for guidance.

     What most hinders you from following God's leading in your
 life? By what means can you know the direction the Lord would
 have you take in any situation? How can you be more responsive
 when God reveals His direction for you?

JOSEPH'S CARE FOR JESUS (Matt. 2:13-15, 19-23).

  How does Joseph continue to exhibit his willingness to follow
God's leading? Matt. 2:13-15, 19-23.


   "Out of Egypt I called my son" (Matt. 2:15, NIV). Hosea 11:1
refers to the Hebrew people's deliverance from Egypt. When urging
Pharaoh to let them go, Moses said, "Thus saith the Lord, Israel is my
son, even my firstborn" (Exod. 4:22). Matthew understood that this
prophecy was another indication that Jesus was the Messiah.
   "So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets: 'He will
be called a Nazarene' " (Matt. 2:23, NIV). Critics of the Bible often
point to the fact that there is no prophecy in Scripture resembling the
one Matthew refers to in verse 23. "However, it is worthy of note that
in previous instances where Matthew quotes a specific prophecy he
speaks of 'the prophet'. . . . His use of the plural form of the word
`prophets' in this instance clearly implies reference, not to a particular
prophetic statement, but to several, which, taken together, led to the
conclusion here stated. . . . It is possible, also, that Matthew quotes
inspired writings that did not become a part of the canon of Scrip-
ture."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 293.
   In Isaiah 11:1, a Messianic prophecy, the Hebrew word for "sprout"
or "branch" is similar to the Hebrew word for Nazarene. It is possible
"that the prophecies of Jesus as the 'Branch' could appropriately be
applied to the fact that He grew up in the city of Nazareth."—SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 293.
   Although Joseph was not Jesus' biological father, Matthew 2 re-
veals the seriousness with which he took the rearing of Mary's Child.

   The influence of the father in the lives of his children is crucial.
What guidance does Scripture give to fathers about their respon-
sibilities toward their children?

Deut. 6:6, 7


Eph. 6:4


Prov. 13:24


    How can the church at large and mothers assist fathers in
 fulfilling their responsibilities to their children?

                                                                        85
Friday                                             December 8
FURTHER STUDY: To find additional character traits of godly
fathers, study the lives of other fathers in the Bible. In your study you
might include Abraham, Jacob, Eli, and David.
   Read "Eli and His Sons" in Patriarchs and Prophets, chapter 56,
pp. 575-580; The Adventist Home, chapters 34-37, pp. 211-228.

   "Abraham's affection for his children and his household led him to
guard their religious faith, to impart to them a knowledge of the divine
statutes, as the most precious legacy he could transmit to them, and
through them to the world. All were taught that they were under the
rule of the God of heaven. There was to be no oppression on the part
of parents, and no disobedience on the part of children. God's law had
appointed to each his duties, and only in obedience to it could any
secure happiness or prosperity.
   "His own example, the silent influence of his daily life, was a
constant lesson. The unswerving integrity, the benevolence and un-
selfish courtesy, which had won the admiration of kings, were dis-
played in the home. There was a fragrance about the life, a nobility
and loveliness of character, which revealed to all that he was con-
nected with Heaven."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 142.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What new insights have you gained about Joseph and the
     importance of the role he played in Jesus' life? What does
     God expect of fathers today?

     2. Does God reveal His will for your life today as directly as
        He did for Joseph? Why or why not?

     3. In accordance with the custom of his times, Joseph could
        have been quite cruel to Mary. But because of his belief in
        God, he broke with tradition. Do you think it was easy for
        Joseph to break with tradition? Are there some traditions
        regarding women in your part of the world that Christian-
        ity could very well overrule?

SUMMARY: Studying Joseph and the way God led him provides us
with insight into the character of this dedicated follower of God.
Certainly God could safely trust His Son to one who exhibited such
trust and obedience. Joseph's care for Mary and her Child serves as an
example for all fathers in providing for the needs of the family.
   Joseph's attitude in responding to God's guidance is one from
which we all can learn. If we will daily turn to God, He will direct us.
Our part is to study the Bible and commune with Him through medita-
tion and prayer.

Global Mission
                   Indonesian Women Plant Church:
    '6337                    The Baptism
                                    Rose Otis

           This was it. The months of planning, praying, and ministering
        were past. The evangelistic meetings had gone well. Would any-
        one sit in the seats reserved for baptismal candidates? An elderly
        man walked quietly to the front of the chapel, carrying a change of
        clothes. Soon a Muslim couple arrived, smiling happily. Then
        three men in their twenties took seats in the front. How had they
        become interested in the message, I wondered? Would they suffer
        because of their decision to follow Christ? What a blessing they
        would be to this little church in days ahead. Others arrived—entire
        families; single women, small in stature but with eyes shining
        brightly.
           I will never forget standing before this precious group that Sab-
        bath morning. Their eager joy was reflected on the weary faces of the
        women whose ministries had made these meetings possible. Then 59
        men, women, and young people were baptized. They were wel-
        comed into the church with flowers, a new Bible, and a hymnal.
        Then a worker announced that there would be one more baptism.
           During the service we had heard shouting in the churchyard. An
        angry husband had followed his wife to the church, threatening her
        life if she was baptized. She pleaded with him not to make her
        choose between him and her Saviour. She wanted both of their
        love. Finally he left, promising not to harm her. Tearfully she
        stepped into the baptismal font, the sixtieth gem plucked from
        Islam. She was crying; I was too! I think God was too!
            A local representative to parliament read a message honoring
        the work of these women. Before he took his seat he said, "I
        believe in Jesus Christ too. You cannot be a true Muslim unless
        you can accept Jesus Christ, unless you get ready for Him to come
        again to this earth." Had these devoted, humble women given this
        man a closer look at who Jesus is and what He wants to do for all
      E who claim His saving power? I'm convinced they did.

                                           begged her husband not to make
                                           her choose between him and her

            Mary and Elizabeth
             Called by God




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Luke 1:5-7, 24-55; 2:16-19.

     MEMORY TEXT: " am the Lord's servant,' Mary answered.
     `May it be to me as you have said' "(Luke 1:38, NIV).

   KEY THOUGHT: By studying God's call to Mary and Elizabeth
and the responses they made, we can gain greater understanding of
how we can respond in faith to God when He calls us to a special task
or responsibility.

   MOTHERS DEDICATED TO GOD. The lives of Mary and
Elizabeth reveal two women so dedicated to God that He trusted them
to be the mothers of the Messiah and His forerunner, John the Baptist.
A study of their lives gives evidence of their openness to God's plan
for them.
   When she looks upon her baby for the first time, a mother believes
that the child is unique and special, with infinite potential. This tiny
miracle is like no other that has ever been born. For Elizabeth and her
cousin Mary this was especially true. Their children came into the
world after God chose these women to perform a unique role. Eliza-
beth was to be the mother of the one who would fulfill the prophetic
role of preparing the way for the Messiah. Mary accepted the respon-
sibility of being the mother to God's Son.
   As we learned in last week's lesson, Mary's consent to God's will
could have placed her in a precarious position culturally. Yet she did
not count the cost. How willing are you to follow God's design for
your life? Only if it doesn't cost too much? But then, what is "too
much" to do for Someone who gave His all for you?

ELIZABETH'S READINESS (Luke 1:5-7).

   While Zacharias is the main character in Luke's record of the
conception and birth of John the Baptist, details are revealed about
Elizabeth that help us gain insights into her character and her readi-
ness to fulfill her role as mother to John the Baptist.

  What do the following verses reveal about the background and
character of Elizabeth? How did these character qualities prepare
her for the responsibilities of motherhood?

Luke 1:5-7


Luke 1:24, 25


Luke 1:41-45


Luke 1:57-66


   Perhaps Elizabeth secluded herself for five months in order to
"give thought and study to the responsibility of rearing a child to
whom so important a task as that assigned John was to be entrusted.
Such a motive would seem to be fully in harmony with Elizabeth's
character."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 678.
   In looking for a couple to bear and train the forerunner of the
Messiah, God chose a husband and wife who exhibited total dedica-
tion to the revealed will of God. "In their quiet and holy lives the light
of faith shone out like a star amid the darkness of those evil days."
—The Desire of Ages, p. 97. For a woman in Israel, no curse was
greater than being barren. And even though Zacharias and Elizabeth
had no child, their faith and trust in God did not waver.
   Their child was to be a Nazarite. (See Luke 1:15; The Desire of
Ages, p. 102.) He was never to "take wine or other fermented drink,"
and he was to be "filled with the Holy Spirit even from birth" (Luke
1:15, NIV; compare Num. 6:2). Alcohol has no place in the life of a
Spirit-filled believer.

    "It was through faith that the child of promise was given. It is
 through faith that spiritual life is begotten, and we are enabled
 to do the works of righteousness."—The Desire of Ages, p. 98.

MARY'S CALL (Luke 1:26-29).

   Just as an angel announced to Zacharias the birth of John the
Baptist, so the angel Gabriel visited Mary to reveal God's plan for her
to be the mother of the Messiah.

   Describe Mary's initial response to Gabriel's message. Luke
1:26-29, 34.


   In addressing Mary, the angel first spoke words of assurance.
Although we rightly view Mary as a woman of great faith, the pres-
ence of the angel with his unusual message brought the realization that
there would be many questions and misunderstandings on the part of
her family, neighbors, and friends.

  How did Gabriel's words give Mary hope and encouragement?
Luke 1:30-38.


   How quickly Mary's humble faith turned her perplexity into accep-
tance and belief. " 'I am the Lord's servant,' Mary answered. 'May it
be to me as you have said' " (Luke 1:38, NIV). "The matter was
settled with Mary as soon as it became clear to her what God's will
was, and as soon as sufficient information had been imparted to her to
enable her to carry out her part intelligently. . . .
   "Mary gives further expression to a meek and submissive spirit.
The unaffected dignity, purity, simplicity, and delicacy with which
Luke relates the story bears the mark of historical fact, not of imagina-
tive writing. Efforts of some to shame Mary, and of others to deify
her, are equally unjustified by the facts of Scripture."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 5, p. 684.
   Even though from the human perspective the plan would be impos-
sible, the angel reminded Mary that with God all things are possible.
And with confidence Mary stated her willingness to be the instrument
of God's will.
   Mary's trust in God is an example for Christians today. How
often we find ourselves in situations we believe are impossible for
God, trusting in our own wisdom and planning to work out difficul-
ties. God's desire is for us first to turn to Him for guidance and then to
trust His leading.

    In what area of your life do you most need to be reminded
 that "nothing is impossible with God" (Luke 1:37)? How can
 you learn to trust God in that situation?

MARY AND ELIZABETH MEET (Luke 1:36, 37, 39-45).

  When the angel spoke his words of encouragement to Mary, he told
her of the child to be born to her cousin Elizabeth. Knowing that
Zacharias and Elizabeth had gone so many years without children,
Mary received this information with joy and praise to God.

   Consider how the message of Elizabeth's pregnancy would have
strengthened Mary's trust in God's plan for herself. Luke 1:36,
37.


   Upon hearing the news of the child expected by Elizabeth and
Zacharias, Mary quickly set out to visit the couple. What a joyful
meeting they experienced! Filled with the Holy Spirit, Elizabeth pro-
claimed a blessing upon Mary.

  What specific blessings did Elizabeth share with Mary? How
do these blessings reflect the message of the angel to Mary about
her coming Child? Luke 1:42-45.


   Elizabeth blessed Mary because she was favored of God in His
selection of her to be "the mother of my Lord," and because she had
exhibited faith in God's revelation to her. Mary's faith in God's
ability to fulfill His promises is a model for Christians today.
   "Faith is trusting God—believing that He loves us and knows best
what is for our good. Thus, instead of our own, it leads us to choose
His way. In place of our ignorance, it accepts His wisdom; in place of
our weakness, His strength; in place of our sinfulness, His righteous-
ness. Our lives, ourselves, are already His; faith acknowledges His
ownership and accepts its blessing."—Education, p. 253.
   This is the quality of faith Mary revealed in her life. The depth of
her faith is evidenced in her willingness to trust God's plan for her
life. The blessings in the life of Mary were not to come without
difficulties, but she was assured the Lord was with her (Luke 1:28).
She would face the accusations about her pregnancy, the difficult
journey to Bethlehem, the flight to Egypt, and finally the painful death
of her Son on Calvary. These trials she would encounter, but not
without the presence of the God she loved. He would sustain her.

   When has your faith in God's plan for your life been tested?
 How did you know the Lord was with you?

MARY'S SONG OF PRAISE TO GOD (Luke 1:46-55).

   Mary's visit to Zacharias and Elizabeth confirmed all that the angel
had spoken to her. Elizabeth was expecting a child, and her words of
blessing added to Mary's confidence in God. She was filled with such
adoration and love for God that she broke forth in words of praise
(Luke 1:46-55).
   God's goodness. Mary's inspired words begin with personal praise
to God. She thanks Him because "he has looked with favor on the
lowliness of his servant" (Luke 1:48, NRSV). Mary recognizes that
God has favored her, not because of her own worthiness, but because
of His grace. She is blessed because of the great things God has done
for her. Her response is one of recognition and thanks for God's
goodness.
   Mary's prayer also acknowledges God's presence with all His
people. She remembers that God has always acted on behalf of His
own. She contrasts God's activity against the proud, the powerful, and
the rich with His care for the lowly and the hungry.

  What does Mary's song reveal about the character and work of
God? Luke 1:46-55.


     Summarize how Mary's song prefigures Jesus' mission.


    As we compare the message of God's activities in this song with
the life of Jesus, we notice striking parallels. In His life on earth Jesus
brought hope and life to the disadvantaged as He challenged the proud
and powerful. For each His desire was to bring the message of eternal
life through acceptance of His life and death for them.
    "These are the most revolutionary words ever spoken. Through the
Messiah, the mighty will be brought low; the humble, the lowly, will
be exalted. . . . Jesus, the ultimate revolutionary, completely reverses
all human values. What Mary was prophesying about her unborn son
is terrifying to the establishment, whoever and wherever they are.
They cannot hear these words gladly. We may attempt instead to
spiritualize these verses, but deep down we all know that Jesus has
come to instigate the kind of revolution we need."—Bruce Larson,
The Communicator's Commentary: Luke, Lloyd J. Ogilvie, gen. ed.
(Waco, Tex.: Word, Inc., 1983), pp. 39, 40.

MARY, THE MOTHER OF JESUS (Luke 2:16-19).

  List the qualities Mary exhibited that prepared her to be the
mother of Jesus.

Luke 1:26-38


Luke 1:39-45


Luke 2:16-19


    Servant of God. Mary exhibited a simple dependence upon God
and complete trust in His leading for her life. She saw herself as "the
Lord's servant" (Luke 1:38, NIV). When God revealed His plan to
her, Mary accepted it. Because of her quick and heartfelt acceptance
of God's plan, we can assume Mary had close fellowship with God
through past experience.
   When the shepherds came with their report of the angels' visit,
"Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart"
(Luke 2:19, NIV). We might assume she spent time during her preg-
nancy studying the Scriptures for evidence of her Child's mission.
And when she heard the shepherds' account, she accepted it as further
evidence of God's plan.
   Simeon's words to Mary (Luke 2:33-35) warned that Jesus' mis-
sion to humanity would result in pain for her. Her precious Child
would bring not only joy but sorrow as He fulfilled the destiny to
which He was called.

   How would the character qualities Mary exhibited early in life
aid her in relating to Jesus' ministry and death?


  Mary's trust in God's plan for her life and her willingness to give
God the praise and glory for His goodness provide an example from
which all Christians can learn.

    How much time do I spend in daily study of God's Word and
 in prayer so that I can discern His communication to me? How
 willing am I to trust His leading in my life, even if His plan seems
 impossible? Do I respond to God's grace toward me by praising
 Him daily, even though I cannot see exactly where He is leading
 me?

                                                                     93

FURTHER STUDY: Study the prayer of praise Hannah offered in
1 Samuel 2:1-10. Compare it with the prayer of thanks Mary offered in
Luke 1:46-55. How do both prayers reflect God's activities on behalf
of these godly women and His people?
   Read The Adventist Home, "Influence of the Mother," chapter 39,
pp. 240-243.

   "Women have need of great patience before they are qualified to
become mothers. God has ordained that they shall be fitted for this
work. The work of the mother becomes infinite through her connec-
tion with Christ. It is beyond understanding. Woman's office is sa-
cred. The presence of Jesus is needed in the home. . . . What a world
we would have if all mothers would consecrate themselves on the altar
of God, and would consecrate their offspring to God, both before and
after its birth!"—The Adventist Home, p. 255.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Using Mary's song of praise (Luke 1:46-55) as an example,
     write your own message of thanks to God for what He has
     done in your life.

     2. In what ways has God helped you in times of need?

     3. How can the lives of Zacharias, Elizabeth, and Mary pro-
        vide guidance for prospective parents?

SUMMARY: A study of the lives of Mary and Elizabeth helps us to
realize that God does not need men and women of wealth, fame, or
human authority in order to fulfill His plan. God's greatest need is for
those who are willing to commit their lives fully to Jesus Christ. He
wants us to know that "nothing is impossible with God" (Luke 1:37,
NIV), and He wants us to respond to His plan by saying, "May it be to
me as you have said" (Luke 1:38, NIV).

                Ordinary Women Perform Extraordinarily
                                  C. S. Marandi

             In the Southern Asia Division teaching the illiterate to read
          has become a Sabbath School outreach project. Local churches
          hold literacy classes to help members learn to read their Bibles,
          which would help them spiritually, and to reach out in love
          and concern to those who are not in the church.
             Sushilabai Prakash Bhalerao is a young widow living in
          Maharashtra, India. She was illiterate and felt she had little to
          offer until her pastor introduced an adult-literacy program in
          her church. In less than a year Sushilabai learned to read her
          Bible. Her whole outlook in life has changed.
             She saw what a difference reading had made in her life and
          decided to help other women in her own village. She began
          conducting a literacy program, and watched other women change
          their lives, as well. Then she began to teach them about Jesus.
             Sushilabai looks happy and self-confident as she reads the
          Scripture passage for worship service. And the faces of the
          women in church brighten as they see one of their own partici-
          pating during worship, a tremendous testimony of the effec-
          tiveness of this adult ministry.
             Sushilabai invited us to her home, where ten women meet
          for adult-literacy class. Five of these women are taking Bible
          studies; three have already been baptized.
             One field in Southern Asia Division reports that hundreds
          have learned to read through the adult literacy program. Twelve
          persons have been baptized, and 18 are taking Bible studies as a
          direct result of the adult-literacy program outreach. Teaching
          members to read will help them to witness more effectively.
                                          Our ordinary women and men can
                                          do extraordinary work for the
                                           Lord.

                    The Call of
                   the Shepherds




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Luke 2:8-20.

     MEMORY TEXT: "For unto you is born this day in the city of
     David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord" (Luke 2:11).

  KEY THOUGHT: God reveals the message of the Messiah to
anyone receptive of the good news and willing to share it with others.

   A SAVIOUR IS BORN. God first revealed the news of His Son's
birth to a group of shepherds. Why did He entrust this news to a group
of men looked down upon by society's more favored class? Why was
the good news first announced to a group of men unlikely to be able to
influence those in authority? God knew that these humble shepherds
studied the prophecies and prayed for the coming of the Messiah. Thus
they were prepared to receive the message "Unto you is born this day
in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord" (Luke 2:11).
   This Christmas season, where is your focus? Are you so involved
with shopping for just the right present that you are missing the gift of
Heaven? In your rush to decorate the house, prepare holiday treats,
and travel to visit family, are you in danger of ignoring the story of the
Christ Child? Or are you looking for opportunities to share the glory
of the Christmas message with others? How can you be more like the
shepherds in your readiness to receive the message of a Saviour who
has come and who has promised to come again?

THE SHEPHERDS RECEIVE A VISITOR (Luke 2:8, 9).

   Instead of religious leaders, earthly rulers, or rabbis, God chose
shepherds as the first to tell the news of His Son's birth. This is
especially unusual "because shepherds were among the lowest and
most despised social groups. The very nature of their work kept them
from entering into the mainstream of Israel's society. They couldn't
maintain the ceremonial washings and observe all the religious festi-
vals and feasts."—MacArthur, p. 75.

   What does Luke 2:8, 9, 15-20 reveal about the shepherds that
would indicate why God revealed to them the good news of Jesus'
birth?


   While most of God's people seemed indifferent to the prophecies
that pointed to the first advent of the Messiah, there were a few who
were ready for the announcement of His birth. Although viewed as
outcasts by others, God knew that these shepherds would eagerly
receive and share this blessed message. As they tended their flocks in
the fields, they utilized the time in personal preparation. "Through the
silent hours they talked together of the promised Saviour, and prayed
for the coming of the King to David's throne."—The Desire of Ages,
p. 47. Thus God knew they would receive the news with joy and
gladness.

   How was the message of Isaiah 9:2, 3 partially fulfilled in the
story of the shepherds?


   The light of God. Certainly at this period of Israel's history there
was great darkness among the people. Their understanding of the
prophecies that could have prepared them for the birth of the Messiah
was clouded. Yet among those who were searching, God revealed the
birth of the One who is the light of the world.
   God also desires us to be prepared and eager to share the good
news of His second advent. He is looking for people who are spending
time in personal preparation so that they will be ready to announce
His coming.

    "To those who are seeking for light, and who accept it with
 gladness, the bright rays from the throne of God will shine."
 —The Desire of Ages, p. 47. How are you preparing for God to
 use you in sharing the good news of Jesus' second advent?


                                                                       97
Monday                                            December 18
 THE ANGEL'S MESSAGE (Luke 2:10, 11).

  List at least five elements of hope in the "good news" the angel
brought. Luke 2:10, 11.


   The angel frightened the shepherds, a reaction the angel was quick
to dispel. His message was one of good news that would result in great
joy for the listeners and for all humanity. As revealed in the Incarna-
tion, God's love did not bring fear, but hope. (Compare 1 John
4:18.)
   The waiting was over. The promises were fulfilled. The long-
looked-for Messiah had been born in the city of David. How could
the shepherds be certain? The certainty resulted from the realization
that the prophecies had been fulfilled. "But as for you, Bethlehem
Ephrathah . . . from you One will go forth for Me to be ruler in Israel.
His goings forth are from long ago, from the days of eternity" (Micah
5:2, NASB).
   The angel's message identified the Child as the Saviour. Here the
message of God's grace to humankind is most evident. We are no
longer destined to be eternally lost, but to find salvation through
Jesus Christ (Matt. 1:21).
   While the religious leaders were looking for a Messiah who would
establish an earthly kingdom for Israel, the King had arrived who
would include the whole world in His ministry.
   The title Christ the Lord "identifies Christ with 'the Lord' of OT
times."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 700. In this Child all the
hope of humanity reached fulfillment. The incarnation of God in
human flesh is now complete. Surely the shepherds could receive no
greater news.
   We have read and heard the words of Luke 2:10, 11 "so often that
the first surprise has gone from them. . . . Yet the wonder and
mystery of the Incarnation is precisely in the fact that those things
were so. For in the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, and in all that the life
of Jesus was afterwards to reveal, there is the message that not only is
there a God, but that God comes very near. To believe that God is
above us is one thing. To believe that God is a strength sufficient for
us is another and still more inspiring confidence. But to believe that
God is not only almighty, that he is not only all-sufficient, but that he
is God with us, God the near, the understanding and the intimate—
that is best of all."—The Interpreter's Bible, vol. 8, p. 54.

   What elements of the good news to the shepherds are the
 most encouraging to you? How can you best share this good
 news when others desire to know about Jesus?

THE HUMBLE SIGN, THE CONTRASTING GLORY (Luke 2:12-
14).

   How did the message of the angel prepare the shepherds to find
Jesus? Luke 2:11, 12.


    In the excitement of the moment, the shepherds are not left without
directions for finding the Child. As the angel speaks, "visions of glory
fill the minds of the listening shepherds. The Deliverer has come to
Israel! Power, exaltation, triumph, are associated with His coming.
But the angel must prepare them to recognize their Saviour."—The
Desire of Ages, p. 47.

   What phrase in Luke 2:13, 14 emphasizes the great significance
of the song sung by the heavenly host?


    Heaven could no longer retain its joy over the birth of the earth's
Redeemer. The importance of this event was not lost on the heavenly
host, and their desire to spread the news to humanity found voice in
their song of praise.
    The song underlines the need for us to turn our attention and praise
toward heaven. "The plan of salvation originated with God, and it is
fitting that both angels and men should ascribe glory and praise to
Him. . . . The plan of salvation reconciles God and men, so bringing
peace to men and glory to God."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5,
p. 700. The plan to reveal the great mercy and grace of God toward
humankind was in progress. The shepherds needed only to travel to
the manger in Bethlehem to see the Son of God made flesh. There
could be no greater reason to sing praises.
    The order of the angel's proclamation is important. Peace among
earth's citizens is one of the goals of God's grace. But such peace
cannot be accomplished unless earth's citizens first learn to praise
God. The improvement of our condition is not the result of any earthly
strategy. It is the consequence of accepting God's salvation and of
being thankful for it.

    When we comprehend something of God's grace as revealed
 in Jesus' birth, the result will be a change of attitude toward
 others. The peace of Christ will reign in our hearts. (Compare
 Eph. 2:14.) In what ways has the good news of Jesus Christ
 broken down walls separating you from others? Why should
 this good news be the most unifying factor among God's pro-
 fessed people today?

                                                                       99

THE SHEPHERDS RESPOND (Luke 2:15-20).

  Choose single words or short phrases from Luke 2:15-17 that
describe the shepherds' response to the angel's message.

   The light and glory accompanying the heavenly host dimmed, and
the shepherds were again alone in darkness on the hillside. Yet it was
not the same. They now had the good news of the Saviour's birth.
Their joy must achieve expression. Nothing could stand in their way
of finding this Child.
   As with the heavenly host, the shepherds could not keep the news
to themselves. In their excitement they related their discovery to
anyone who would listen. And as is typical with good news, the
message spread quickly, even to the skeptical religious leaders.
   "The priests and elders of Jerusalem were not as ignorant concern-
ing the birth of Christ as they pretended. The report of the angels' visit
to the shepherds had been brought to Jerusalem, but the rabbis had
treated it as unworthy of their notice."—The Desire of Ages, p. 62.

   What aspect of their experience do you think the shepherds
were most eager to share? What were the reactions to the shep-
herds' message? Luke 2:18, 19. What were the shepherds' reac-
tions when they had confirmed the angel's announcement? Luke
2:20.


    There was much they could tell: the visitation of the angel with the
heavenly host, the words of praise they heard, the fulfillment of
prophecy, and the message of salvation through the Saviour.
    "Heaven and earth are no wider apart today than when shepherds
listened to the angels' song. . . .
    "The story of Bethlehem is an exhaustless theme. In it is hidden
`the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God.'
Rom. 11:33. We marvel at the Saviour's sacrifice in exchanging the
throne of heaven for the manger, and the companionship of adoring
angels for the beasts of the stall. Human pride and self-sufficiency
stand rebuked in His presence. Yet this was but the beginning of His
wonderful condescension."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 48, 49.

   As you reflect on what Jesus has done for you, with whom
 would you most like to share the message of salvation? For what
 would you like to praise Him today?

PREPARING FOR THE ADVENT (Matt. 24:14).

   When the shepherds received the salvation message, they experi-
enced a desire to share the good news. Those who are awaiting the
second advent of Jesus also will have a desire to share with others the
news of His salvation and coming.

   How do the following texts contribute to your understanding of
the role God calls you to act as you await Jesus' second advent?

Matt. 24:14


John 17:22, 23


1 Peter 3:8, 9


   If we desire to share the message of salvation with others, we must
first commit our own lives to Jesus Christ. It is possible to share
effectively only what is a part of our own experience. When we know
Christ as our personal Saviour, we will naturally desire to share this
joy with those who are unacquainted with Him.
   "No sooner does one come to Christ, than there is born in his heart
a desire to make known to others what a precious friend he has found
in Jesus; the saving and sanctifying truth cannot be shut up in his
heart. If we are clothed with the righteousness of Christ, and are filled
with the joy of His indwelling Spirit, we shall not be able to hold our
 peace."—Steps to Christ, p. 78.
    As the early Christians awaited the outpouring of the Holy Spirit,
they came close together in unity. "Putting away all differences, all
desire for the supremacy, they came close together in Christian fel-
lowship."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 37. We too must experience
the unity and fellowship brought by the Spirit of God if we are to
represent Christ rightly to the world.

   Meditate upon the following statement: "To the end of time,
 the presence of the Spirit is to abide with the true church. But
 near the close of earth's harvest, a special bestowal of spiritual
 grace is promised to prepare the church for the coming of the
 Son of man."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 55.
    What evidence do you see in the church today of that "spirit-
 ual grace"? What evidence do you see in yourself?

Friday                                          December 22
FURTHER STUDY: Read "Unto You a Saviour" in The Desire of
Ages, chapter 4, pp. 43-49. What lessons do you learn about preparing
for the second coming of Jesus? Also read Matthew 24:42-44; 25:1-
13; Luke 21:34-36; 1 Peter 4:7, 8; 2 Peter 3:10-12. Consider the
relevance of the following statement as we make ready for Christ's
second advent:

   "The class represented by the foolish virgins are not hypocrites.
They have a regard for the truth, they have advocated the truth, they
are attracted to those who believe the truth; but they have not yielded
themselves to the Holy Spirit's working. They have not fallen upon
the Rock, Christ Jesus, and permitted their old nature to be broken
up. . . . They receive the word with readiness, but they fail of assimi-
lating its principles. Its influence is not abiding. The Spirit works
upon man's heart, according to his desire and consent implanting in
him a new nature; but the class represented by the foolish virgins have
been content with a superficial work. They do not know God. They
have not studied His character; they have not held communion with
Him; therefore they do not know how to trust, how to look and live.
Their service to God degenerates into a form."—Christ's Object Les-
sons, p. 411.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How does the message that the angel gave to the shepherds
     compare with the message the angel gave to Joseph in Mat-
     thew 1:20-23?

   2. In what way does the song of the heavenly host (Luke 2:14)
      reveal the principles of God's law? (See The Desire of Ages,
      p. 308.)

   3. What role does the Holy Spirit play in preparing the church
      to share the gospel with the world? (Read "The Gift of the
      Spirit" in The Acts of the Apostles, chapter 5, pp. 47-56.)

SUMMARY: God found the shepherds willing to share with others
the revelation of Jesus' advent. They responded to the announcement
of the heavenly host with joy and gladness. Today God seeks those
who will share the joy of salvation with others in need. God does not
determine His selection on the basis of race, gender, or class but on
our willingness for Him to use us.

                         House Churches in China
            Since 1987 the Adventist church in Harbin, China, has shared
        a Three-Self church building with a Sunday-keeping congrega-
        tion. But when Adventists were told not to preach their doctrines
        in the church, many Adventists refused to worship there.
            One woman started a church in her home. She had no materi-
        als except her Bible. Someone gave her a church hymnal, but she
        could not read music, so she asked a Sunday-keeping pastor to
        help her learn the songs. When he saw the Adventist hymnal he
        scolded her and refused to help her. She left his home in tears.
            Why, she wondered, did people become so angry when they
        heard the name Seventh-day Adventist? If this church was God's
        true church, why did others refuse to accept it? She began to
        study her Bible to prove that her church really followed the
        whole Bible. The more she studied, the more convinced she was
        that her church had the truth. If the Sunday-keeping pastor re-
        fused to preach this message, she would preach it herself!
            When she began holding meetings in her home, only three or
        four women came to read the Bible and pray together. But their
        numbers grew, with many young people joining the group. As the
        group grew, it multiplied into two groups, then into four.
            The Adventist pastor in a nearby town heard about the house
        churches in Harbin. He sent them tapes and invited the house-
        church leaders to come to his home for further Bible study.
        Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, the women changed from
        hesitant, weak speakers to buoyant, powerful, preachers!
            The house churches continue to increase. By 1994 there were
         15 house churches, with the largest group of 200 people meeting
         in the first house church. In 1992 some 400 people were bap-
   tori tized. In 1993 more than 600 joined the church in this city.
            Members have applied for a permit to build their own church,
         but permission has not been given. Today more than 1,500 mem-
         bers in Hardin desperately need suitable places to worship.

             The Birth of Jesus




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: John 1:14-18; Luke 2:1-7,
22-38; Matt. 2:1-13.

   MEMORY TEXT: "And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt
   among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only
   begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth." John 1:14.

   KEY THOUGHT: After so many years of waiting, the Messiah
was born. In a variety of ways, people responded to this event that so
clearly revealed God's grace and mercy to humanity. Likewise today,
people react in many different ways to the news of salvation.

   A JOYFUL EVENT. What an exciting event is the birth of a baby.
After months of preparation, the joyful event occurs. Grandparents,
aunts, uncles, and friends rejoice with the new parents. Friends and
family deliver gifts and offer congratulations.
   While missed by the world at large, the significance of the birth of
Jesus did not go totally unnoticed. The wise men, Herod, Simeon, and
Anna were among those who paid special attention to the birth of this
Child. Their varied reactions to the One sent of God were a reflection
of the responses each of us make to the incarnation of God's grace.
   As you study this week's lesson, try to determine how you have
responded and are responding presently to your Saviour. Does your
reaction to Him more nearly reflect that of the wise men, Herod,
Simeon, or Anna?

THE WORD BECAME FLESH (John 1:1-5, 14-18).

   The greatest event in earth's history takes place in the city of
Bethlehem. A Baby is born. But unlike other births, the birth of this
Child marks the further unfolding of God's plan for redeeming the
human race. God has become flesh. Who is this Child? What makes
Jesus different from all other children born before and after?

   The apostle John assists us in understanding just what made
the birth of Jesus unique. How does he describe the "Word" that
became flesh? John 1:1-5, 14-18.


   There was no doubt in John's mind that the Baby born in Bethlehem
was none other than God, the Creator of all, become flesh. No matter
what else we believe about the story of Christ's birth, this fact is
central. The greatest revelation of the grace and mercy of God is the
fact that Jesus, the eternal God, came to dwell among us.

   What do the following texts contribute to your understanding
of the Incarnation?

Col. 1:15-20


Phil. 2:5-11


Heb. 1:1-3, 6-8


Heb. 10:5-9


   In coming to this earth, Jesus took upon Himself the form of
humanity, uniting it with His divinity, so that we might have salvation.
"Christ was to identify Himself with the interests and needs of human-
ity. He who was one with God has linked Himself with the children of
men by ties that are never to be broken. . . . And all this that man might
be uplifted from the ruin and degradation of sin that he might reflect
the love of God and share the joy of holiness."—Steps to Christ, p. 14.

   Of what special significance for us is the truth that Jesus is
 now and forever tied to humanity?


                                                                      105

THE BIRTH OF JESUS (Luke 2:1-7).

  Describe the circumstances leading to the presence of Joseph
and Mary in Bethlehem. Luke 2:1-7.


   How were these circumstances a fulfillment of Old Testament
prophecy? Why was it important for Jesus, of the lineage of David,
to be born in the City of David? Micah 5:2.


   The long months of waiting were over. Joseph and Mary had
completed their weary trip to Bethlehem. The time had arrived for the
birth of the Baby. Since "there was no room for them in the inn" (Luke
2:7), Mary and Joseph found themselves housed with the animals.
And Mary, a first-time mother, gave birth to the Son of God. There
were no fancy clothes or attractive cradle. Only swaddling clothes and
a manger.
   The hope for humanity's freedom from sin and its penalty was
born. God's plan for the redemption of humankind was being fulfilled.
The birth of Jesus marks God's greatest revelation of His grace and
mercy toward women, men, and children. Without this demonstration
of God's love, humanity would be eternally lost.
   God's plan for the salvation of humanity does not stop with the
birth of Jesus. The birth, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus have no
effect until we accept Him personally. God is interested in the rebirth
of each of His children. Jesus emphasizes this point in His dialog with
Nicodemus.

  What importance does Jesus place upon the rebirth experi-
ence? John 3:1-8.


   During the Christmas season it is easy to overlook the true message
of the holiday. The message is not only about the birth of Jesus; it is
also a message about the need for each person to consider again why
Jesus came to this earth. The message of His birth speaks to us of
God's mercy and grace in providing a substitute for us. It shows us
God's willingness to go to any length to provide for our salvation. The
message of Christmas asks for our response.

   How can you more closely reflect the meaning of Christmas
in your own life? How can you communicate to your family and
friends the true meaning of Christmas?

SIMEON AND ANNA RECOGNIZE JESUS (Luke 2:22-38).

   What brought Joseph and Mary to Jerusalem? Luke 2:22-24.


   The time had arrived for Mary and Joseph to fulfill the specifica-
tions of the law in presenting Jesus to the Father. As Mary's firstborn,
Jesus was the fulfillment of God's promise that His firstborn Son
would be the salvation of humanity.

  Summarize the role the Holy Spirit played in bringing Simeon
and Anna to Jesus. Luke 2:25-27, 36, 37.


   The leading of the Holy Spirit. Luke makes it plain that the
encounter of Simeon and Anna with Jesus was not mere coincidence.
They were both open to the Holy Spirit's guidance during their lives.
When Mary and Joseph presented Jesus to the Father in the temple,
the Spirit guided Simeon and Anna to meet with them.

   List specific words Simeon spoke that described the mission of
Jesus in coming to this earth. How did Anna's behavior corrobo-
rate Simeon's testimony? Luke 2:29-38.


   We know very little about Anna, but what Luke does tell us about
her is quite important. First of all, she was a widow. And like the
shepherds, widows were among the lower classes of society. Yet her
station in life did not matter to God, who entrusted her with the all-
important message of the gospel. Furthermore, as a widow and a
member of a low social class, Anna was well acquainted with sorrow.
But it does not seem that this sorrow caused her to be bitter or
resentful. Second, Anna was old. But she never gave up hope. Age
robs us all of strength and energy. But far worse, age, like sorrow, can
turn our optimism and idealism into cynical despair so that we become
resigned and even a bit content with "the way things are."
   How, then, was Anna able to keep her faith alive? She worshiped
God at every opportunity. She never failed to pray. Anna's hope
burned brightly because she determined not to lose her connection
with the Source of her hope.

    Anna and Simeon were both elderly, yet their service to God
 was vital. What can your local congregation do to encourage its
 senior members to use their talents for the advancement of the
 gospel?

                                                                     107

THE WISE MEN'S VISIT (Matt. 2:1-12).

   Visitors from the East. Matthew records the visit of wise men.
Who were these mysterious men? For what purpose did they come
looking for this newborn King of the Jews? Some Bible scholars
believe the Magi were from Persia. They were seekers of truth, men of
integrity, and learned in their country's philosophy, medicine, and
natural science. Most likely they also were astronomers, and as they
"studied the starry heavens, and sought to fathom the mystery hidden
in their bright paths, they beheld the glory of the Creator. Seeking
clearer knowledge, they turned to the Hebrew Scriptures. In their own
land were treasured prophetic writings that predicted the coming of a
divine teacher. Balaam belonged to the magicians, though at one time
a prophet of God; by the Holy Spirit he had foretold the prosperity of
Israel and the appearing of the Messiah. . . . But in the Old Testament
the Saviour's advent was clearly revealed. The magi learned with joy
that His coming was near, and that the whole world was to be filled
with a knowledge of the glory of the Lord."—The Desire of Ages,
pp. 59, 60.

  How did the appearance of the star (Matt. 2:2, 9) and the
prophetic message in Matthew 2:6 encourage the wise men?


   How did God reward the faithfulness of the wise men in their
search for the Child? Matt. 2:9-12.


   As they approached Jerusalem, the anticipation of the wise men
must have grown. They would soon be able to worship the Child-King
they had come so far to find. How surprised they must have been to
find that Jerusalem seemed uninformed of this event. How they must
have wondered at the humble surroundings of the Child, for this was
the One "born King of the Jews" (Matt. 2:2)! Yet the constant guid-
ance of the star left no doubt in their minds that they had found the
One for whom they had searched.
   God's guidance did not cease after they had found Jesus. He warned
them in a dream that Herod's interest in the Child was, not to worship,
but to harm Him. Thus they were led to return to their own country
without further contact with Herod.

   When has your own searching for Jesus led you to fall down
 and worship Him? What "gift" have you offered Him?

Thursday                                        December 28
HEROD'S REACTION (Matt. 2:1-18).

   What does Herod's response to the news of Jesus' birth say
about his character and how he viewed the importance of this
event? Matt. 2:3-8, 16.


   Herod was the only ruler of Palestine who could keep the peace.
Being a great builder, he even rebuilt the temple in Jerusalem. And
there were occasions when he used his power and wealth toward
charitable ends. Once during difficult times, he excused the people
from their taxes. And during the famine of 25 B.C., he melted down
his own gold to purchase corn for the starving people.
   But Herod was highly protective of his throne. His reaction to
Jesus' birth is not surprising when one considers his reputation for
killing people he even slightly suspected of treason. Thus he had his
wife, mother-in-law, and three sons executed.
   When, at the age of 70, he felt his death was imminent, he ordered
that some of the most distinguished citizens of Jerusalem be arrested
and put to death when he died. Thus he was assured that tears would
flow when he passed away.
   But Herod's one action that is best known to history is his slaughter
of the infants in Bethlehem. But by His superior power God protected
His Son so that the plan of salvation could go forward.

   How did God's continued guidance interfere with Herod's plans
for the Child? Matt. 2:12-18.


   "Through the wise men, God had called the attention of the Jewish
nation to the birth of His Son. . . .
   Satan was bent on shutting out the divine light from the world, and
he used his utmost cunning to destroy the Saviour. But He who never
slumbers nor sleeps was watching over His beloved Son. He who had
rained manna from heaven for Israel and had fed Elijah in the time of
famine provided in a heathen land a refuge for Mary and the child
Jesus. And through the gifts of the magi from a heathen country, the
Lord supplied the means for the journey into Egypt and the sojourn in
a land of strangers."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 64, 65.

    How do you feel about a God who will go to such great lengths
 to protect His Son? What does this tell you about God's willing-
 ness to guide and protect your life?



                                                                    109
Friday                                            December 29
FURTHER STUDY: Compare and contrast the reactions of the wise
men, Simeon, Anna, and Herod to the birth of Jesus. What do their
responses reveal about their characters? How was it possible for the
wise men, Simeon, and Anna to understand the meaning of Jesus'
birth? Why did Herod, along with the scribes and Pharisees, miss this
significance?
   Read "The Dedication" and "We Have Seen His Star" in The
Desire of Ages, chapters 5 and 6, pp. 50-67.

   "Simeon and the priests represent two classes—those who are
guided by the Spirit of God because they are willing to be instructed,
and those who, refusing to receive the light which would lead them
into all truth, are guided by the spirit of the power of darkness, and are
daily being led into deeper darkness.
   "By divine illumination Simeon understood Christ's mission. The
Holy Spirit impressed his heart. But the priests and rulers were im-
bued with the spirit of the enemy of God; and today the same spirit
influences human minds, controlling with power the hearts of men,
and making of none effect the appeals of the Spirit."—Ellen G. White
Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1116.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What further biblical evidence can you find to show that
     Jesus was God in human flesh?

   2. When Mary and Joseph presented Jesus to the Father in
      the temple, they offered two doves because they were too
      poor to offer a lamb. Why is it significant that Jesus was
      born into such a home?

SUMMARY: The "incarnation of grace" was complete. While all
heaven rejoiced at the birth of the Son of God, few on earth were
prepared for this event. Pride, selfishness, and closed-mindedness
prevented them from meeting with joy the news of the Saviour's birth.
   But God was not without the faithful who were looking with eager-
ness for the birth of the Messiah. The wise men, Simeon, and Anna
represent this group. God led each of them to a personal encounter
with the Christ child.
   As many were not ready for His first appearance, so many will not
be ready for His second coming. Today, as then, God is looking for
people who will respond to Jesus with gratitude, joy, and a desire to
share the message of salvation with others. There is no greater revela-
tion of God's grace toward humanity than the incarnation of Jesus
Christ. How will you respond?

              Sometimes in my life I have wondered whether God exists. For
           years we were taught that religion was irrelevant in our Commu-
           nist country of Slovakia. But God knew my needs, and when I did
           not know He was there, He saw me.
              My husband and I have had a stormy marriage. During a time
           when my children and I were alone, we wondered whether God
           existed, and if so, could we ever know about Him. Soon after that,
           we found an invitation card in the mail box from an American
           evangelist.
              My 17-year-old son Kamil attended the first lecture by the
           evangelist. His younger brother joined him at the second lecture,
           and from the third one all of us went together. That is when I held
           the Bible in my hands for the first time. I read about the struggle
           between the spiritual powers—God and Satan. At first I found the
           preacher's words hard to believe, but then he told an experience
           that convinced me that God sees me.
              One day as the minister was praying and asking the Lord to lead
           him, he said he saw a woman banging her fists on a glass wall,
           bleeding and crying, "Come and preach for us." As he told the
           audience this, a shiver ran down my spine. I had pounded a glass
           wall just that way when my husband had left us. In tears and
           despair, I had been asking for God's help. I asked myself a
           question: "Could this evangelist have seen me crying for help
           from the Lord?"
               I realized that God was calling me to Him. That same evening I
           decided to follow Jesus Christ. Soon after, my sons and I were
           baptized. I'm so grateful that God saw me and showed me to this
           evangelist, and that He opened His arms to someone who had
           turned to Him only when she needed help. Since then our life has a
           purpose and is full of joy. When I see my sons living with Jesus
           and my little daughter singing about "bright stars," I am over-
           whelmed with happiness. I thank God for His messenger and for
           the love of Jesus Christ.

Lesson 1: The Centrality of the Bible.
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Tim. 3:14-17; John 8:31, 32;
  Prov. 2:1-15.

MEMORY TEXT: Proverbs 2:4, 5.

KEY THOUGHT: The Bible provides the basis for doctrinal truth,
