 The Sabbath School Lesson Video
             See what you've been missing!
    Educators have long known the power of visual aids. Jesus Himself often
 used the objects of the visual world to teach His spiritual lessons effectively.
    Now this tremendous combination of the word spoken and the word seen is
 available through the new adult Sabbath School theme videos.
    Professionally produced by the Church Ministries department, these videos
 are a special blessing to Sabbath School students, shut-ins, small groups, and
 isolated members.
      Available each quarter from your Adventist Book Center.

             THE YEAR OF THE
            ADVENTIST WOMAN
   One hundred and fifty years ago, devoted Seventh-day Adventist
women were at the center of the birthing process of this movement;
evangelizing, nurturing, prophesying, publishing, and playing a signifi-
cant role in developing the organizational structure of the church. The
most prominent of these women was Ellen Gould White, who wrote,
"When a great and decisive work is to be done, God chooses men
and women to do this work, and it will feel the loss if the talents of
both are not combined."—Evangelism, p. 469.
    In 1995, our world church is focusing on the challenges and oppor-
tunities of today's Adventist women. Unlike the goals of secular femi-
nism, the goals of Women's Ministries encourage healing, spiritual
wholeness, vision, and expanded involvement.
    Women's Ministries programs range anywhere from small groups
in local churches to Global Mission projects where whole congrega-
tions are raised up. They include scholarships and mentoring of young
women, instructing new members, spiritual retreats that fortify mem-
bers and bring the discouraged to a new commitment, and prayer
counseling. ("When a woman is in trouble, let her take her trouble to a
woman."—Evangelism, p. 460.) Other programs include parenting semi-
nars, retreats that facilitate healing from abusive relationships, pro-
grams for single women and those who are "single again," and support
for persons whose stress-filled lives make balancing family, job, and
church responsibilities a meritorious achievement. In short, Women's
Ministries provides a network among four million women, making
them aware of new opportunities in which to participate, and occasions
to nurture and be nurtured.
    Just as in Jesus' day when mothers trained future leaders at their
knee, and godly women clothed the less fortunate and served as church
leaders, judges, and shopkeepers, contemporary Adventist women are
eager to use their talents to the glory of God.
    Speaking to her own gender, Ellen White wrote, "We may do a
noble work for God if we will. Woman does not know her
power.... There is a higher purpose for woman, a grander destiny.
She should develop and cultivate her powers, for God can employ
 them in the great work of saving souls from eternal ruin."—Testi-
monies , vol. 4, p. 642.
    The year 1995 is a salute to women's contributions to the growth
 and development of the church, as well as a summons to fortify them-
 selves spiritually and commit their talents to a finished work.

              Introduction to
        Great Chapters of the Bible

    Some years ago G. Campbell Morgan, teacher extraordinary, authored
the book Great Chapters of the Bible. He examined 50 outstanding
segments of Scripture. The volume became popular immediately. He
explained in the foreword that he did not wish to compare these 50
chapters with others in the Bible. "No such comparison is intended," he
stated. "Every chapter or section of the Sacred Writings has its own
greatness. Nevertheless there are Chapters or Sections which stand out
in the appeal they make to the human heart."—(London: Marshall,
Morgan, & Scott Publishers, 1946), foreword.
    We have elected to study 12 Bible chapters that have satisfied the
human needs of Christians everywhere. This quarterly will be a bless-
ing to people of all religions, even though it will have special signifi-
cance to Seventh-day Adventists who recognize their responsibility of
announcing to the world the three angels' messages of Revelation 14.
    The 12 chapters examined follow a gospel pattern throughout. The
message of the first angel of Revelation 14, the everlasting gospel, is
paramount. The very first lesson is titled "The Great Love Lyric"
(1 Corinthians 13). The second lesson presents "The Suffering Son of
God" (Isaiah 53). This "good news" pattern flows throughout the series.
    In the quality of content, these 12 golden chapters are eternal and
inexhaustible. They bear study and restudy. This quarterly presents
new approaches and new ideas to supplement the glorious array of
commentary already available on the subject. Ellen White wrote, "It
takes all of eternity to unfold the glories and bring out all the precious
treasures of the Word of God."--SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7,
p. 919.
     The great Teacher, Jesus Christ, brings His students over and over
the same ground until at last they understand the subject sufficiently to
reflect the wisdom and love of God obtained from Bible study. Things
 new and old must be extracted from the gold mine of Scripture. There
may be nuggets in this quarterly that you may not have discovered
 previously. You can reexamine with great profit those truths that you
 have understood.
    The psalmist wrote, "The words of the Lord are pure words: as
 silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times" (Ps. 12:6). That
 word tried means "refined." Silver refined in a furnace is purer. The
 more we read the Word, the more luminous its message appears to us,
 for it is, in the truest sense, "the purest truth."


                                                                         5

        The Great Love Lyric




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Cor. 12:4-11, 27-31; 13:1-
13; 14:1.

    MEMORY TEXT: "And now abide faith, hope, love, these
    three; but the greatest of these is love" (1 Corinthians 13:13,
    NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: In 1 Corinthians 13, Paul accents the exqui-
sitely beautiful element in Christian life—love, the precious and
indispensable love of God pervading human lives and portrayed in
behavior.

   LOVE IS OUR INDIVIDUAL AND CORPORATE NEED. As
we read 1 Corinthians 13, we see to what heights an author may
climb when borne aloft by the Holy Spirit of God. Without love, the
Christian, who may receive many other gifts of God, is a pauper.
Someone has said, "Without love he [humanity] is a moral cipher, a
zero in the arithmetic of the ages." The energy and power in all of
God's rich endowments is love.
   "The Lord desires me to call the attention of His people to the
thirteenth chapter of First Corinthians. Read this chapter every day,
and from it obtain comfort and strength. Learn from it the value that
God places on sanctified, heaven-born love, and let the lesson that it
teaches come home to your hearts. Learn that Christlike love is of
heavenly birth, and that without it all other qualifications are worth-
less."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6,
p. 1091.

LOVE GIFTS OF THE SPIRIT (1 Cor. 12:4-11, 27-31; 13:1;
14:1).

   How would you explain the relationship between Paul's dis-
cussion of spiritual gifts in 1 Corinthians 12 and his discussion of
love in 1 Corinthians 13?


   In 1 Corinthians 12 Paul describes the many spiritual gifts with
which the Spirit had endowed the Corinthians. All the gifts of the
Holy Spirit were meant to enrich the believers "for the common
good" (1 Cor. 12:7, RSV). Paul did not want the Corinthians to lack
any gift (1 Cor. 1:7). But in the Corinthian church some were exercis-
ing gifts that the Holy Spirit had not bestowed. "Those who are
unspiritual do not receive the gifts of God's Spirit" (1 Cor. 2:14,
RSV). Paul added, "I could not speak to you as spiritual people, but
rather as people of the flesh" (1 Cor. 3:1, RSV).
   Unless the Spirit of God bestows and activates our gifts, we
cannot regard them as "spiritual" gifts, but as counterfeits. The gifts
that Paul lists in 1 Corinthians 12:4-11 and verses 27-31 are always
bestowed and imparted by the Holy Spirit. Any attempt to use these
gifts apart from the Holy Spirit's action in our lives is an unloving
deed. "If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not
love [imparted by the Spirit], I am a noisy gong or a clanging
cymbal" (1 Cor. 13:1, RSV).

   What relationship do you detect between the love message of
1 Corinthians 13 and the warning about the incorrect use of
tongues in 1 Corinthians 14?


   In 1 Corinthians 13, Paul highlights the preeminent and most
effective gift of all—the love of God in the converted heart. All the
other gifts (more than 20 are mentioned in the New Testament) are
swallowed up in this heavenly love of God. But some of the Corinthians
were not allowing Spirit-directed love to control their speaking in
tongues. Thus their tongues speaking was not edifying to the church;
it was not Spirit directed.

    For the Spirit-inspired use of tongues see Acts 2:4-12. What
 change in the Corinthians' worship service did the Holy Spirit
 wish to bring about? Was the exercise of the Spirit-directed gift
 of tongues controllable by the speaker? 1 Cor. 14:6-12, 26-33.
 (See the note in Further Study.)


                                                                      7

PAUPERS WITHOUT LOVE (1 Cor. 13:1-3).

  Name the five spiritual gifts mentioned by Paul in 1 Corinthians
13:1-3. What becomes of them in the absence of love?


   The word charity is used eight times in the King James Version of
1 Corinthians 13—a word that today suggests pity, sympathy, and
relief for the underprivileged and poor. The Greek word means
"love." The Greek language has four verbs translated "to love" in
English. All four words appear in classical Greek, but the New
Testament uses only phileo and agapao. The New Testament uses
the noun love (agape) for the love God has for fallen man. Taking a
word that was little used in reference to human love, the New Testa-
ment writers infused it with new meaning; namely, God's love for
His earthly children.

  How could you detect that a "Christian" speaker is not di-
rected by love? 1 Cor. 13:1. What should be the basis of the
evaluation?


    A missionary put the first three verses of 1 Corinthians 13 into an
easy-to-understand paraphrase: "If I have the language perfectly and
speak like a native, and have not His love for them, I am nothing. If I
have diplomas and degrees and know all the up-to-date methods, and
have not His touch of understanding love, I am nothing. . . . If I have
all faith and great ideals and magnificent plans, and not His love that
sweats and bleeds and weeps and prays and pleads, I am nothing. If I
give my clothes and money to them, and have not His love for them,
I am nothing.
    "If I surrender all prospects, leave home and friends, make the
sacrifices of a missionary career, and turn sour and selfish amid the
daily annoyances and slights of a missionary life, and have not the
love that yields its rights, its leisures, its pet plans, I am nothing.
Virtue has ceased to go out of me. If I can heal all manner of sickness
and disease, but wound hearts and hurt feelings for want of His love
that is kind, I am nothing. If I can write articles or publish books that
win applause, but fail to transcribe the Word of the Cross into the
language of His love, I am nothing."—Paul Lee Tan, Encyclopedia
of 7,700 Illustrations (Rockville, Md.: Assurance Publishers, 1985),
pp. 758, 759.

LOVELESS, FAITHLESS PROPHECY (1 Cor. 13:2).

   Bible prophets from Moses to John exhibited true, persistent faith
and abiding love. They bore the signature required to qualify as
God's true messengers. "Holy men of God spoke as they were moved
by the Holy Spirit" (2 Peter 1:21, NKJV), and the love of God was
shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Spirit bestowed on them.
True, sin may have marred their record, but their sins were forgiven,
and the habitual tendency of their lives was commendable in God's
sight.

   How did Jesus indicate that we can identify false prophets and
teachers who are not controlled by love (1 Cor. 13:2)? Matt. 7:15,
20.


    Love and faith in God are the acid tests of a prophet—the creden-
tials above all their other God-given gifts. Concerning Ellen G.
White, God's messenger to the remnant, A. G. Daniells wrote: "She
was uniformly pleasant, cheerful, and courageous. She was never
careless, flippant, or in any way cheap in conversation or manner of
life. She was the personification of serious earnestness regarding the
things of the kingdom. I never once heard her boast of the gracious
gift God had bestowed upon her, or of the marvelous results of her
endeavors."—The Abiding Gift of Prophecy (Mountain View, Calif.:
Pacific Press Publishing Assn., 1936), p. 368.
    These warm elements of Christian character were a distinctive
trademark, without which Ellen White's prophetic ministry would
have amounted to little or nothing. All the Bible prophets measured
up to this standard.

  Despite its great appeal, what must accompany love for it to be
functional? Gal. 5:6; 1 Thess. 1:3.


   Preacher or prophet, social worker, dedicated lay person, or mar-
tyr for Christ! Is not Paul telling us that all spiritual gifts must be
immersed in faith and love in order to achieve God's purposes? If we
lack these gifts the luster is gone! In the end, nothing will prove
eternally efficient for good without them.

    How does the life of Dorcas illustrate how Christ would have
 us demonstrate love? Acts 9:36, 39. In what practical ways can
 men, as well as women, follow Dorcas' example?


                                                                      9

LOVE'S SIXTEEN PARTS (1 Cor. 13:4-8, 13).

  How does Paul describe love's behavior as visible in the
Christian's life? 1 Cor. 13:4-8.


   "In the thirteenth chapter of First Corinthians the apostle Paul
defines true Christlike love. . . . This chapter is an expression of the
obedience of all who love God and keep His commandments. It is
brought into action in the life of every true believer."—Ellen G.
White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1091.
   Try to visualize a person who is always patient, kind, generous,
humble, courteous, good natured, forgiving, loyal to God, and will-
ing to accept His will. That Person is Christ! And He wishes to make
us like Himself (Gal. 2:20).
   Count them; you will find colorful parts in the spectrum of love,
more than twice as many as the colors that emerge when white light
passes through a triangular prism.

   What sign of God's love and care for His people did He ap-
point in the heavens? Gen. 9:13-17; Isa. 54:9, 10.


   "The bow represents Christ's love which encircles the earth, and
reaches unto the highest heavens, connecting men with God, and
linking earth with heaven.
   "As we gaze upon the beautiful sight, we may be joyful in God,
assured that He Himself is looking upon this token of His covenant,
and that as He looks upon it He remembers the children of earth, to
whom it was given. Their afflictions, perils, and trials are not hidden
from Him. We may rejoice in hope, for the bow of God's covenant is
over us."—Ellen White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1,
p. 1091.

  What word does John use to portray God? 1 John 4:8. Is Jesus
Christ also God? Heb. 1:8; John 1:1-3, 14. In whom is love
perfectly personified? John 14:6-9; Rom. 5:6-8.


   Instead of the word charity (used eight times in 1 Corinthians
13, KJV) substitute the name of Jesus. Then substitute your
own name. How well do you do? Ask the following questions:
Am I patient with my family, with friends, with co-workers?
Am I kind and considerate with everyone? Am I ever rude or
rash? Do I believe the best about my acquaintances?

LOVE, HOPE, AND FAITH SURVIVE (1 Cor. 13:8-11).

   God will finally terminate some of His gifts (1 Cor.13:8-10).
Prophecy, knowledge, and tongues vanish away.
   "Prophecies are done away in the sense that they are worked out to
fulfillment. Tongues as signs and methods of praise cease when the
necessity for such ends. Knowledge as enquiry is done away as it
merges into the knowledge of fuller revelation. All the things re-
ferred to are great things, and things that tend to edification, but
which cease when the edifice is completed."—G. Campbell Morgan,
Great Chapters of the Bible, p. 254.

 What did Paul do when he became a man? 1 Cor. 13:11, 12.
What promise of a better vision is given to God's people?


   If you compare the knowledge of a little child with the knowledge
of a loving and wise parent, it will be easier to grasp the difference
between what is and what shall be when the Lord sets up His king-
dom.
   "Ancient mirrors were made of polished metal and not of glass. It
was never possible to get distinct images. The word 'obscurely'
would be a better translation than 'darkly.' In this world there is only
an inadequate, imperfect, and partial view of things. Vision will be
much better on the other shore."—Kyle M. Yates, Preaching From
Great Bible Chapters (Waco, Tex.: Word Books, 1957), p. 50.

  Since we cannot take our imperfect gifts to heaven, what can
we take? Above all else, what gift will survive? 1 Cor. 13:13.


   When he was young, Louis IX of France married Princess Marga-
ret of Provence. On his wedding ring was engraved: "God, France,
Margaret," and he used to say, "I have no love outside that ring."
This was the secret of his being known to history as Saint Louis.
Faith, hope, and love define the eternal bond that exists between God
and His people.

    Imagine how perfect spiritual vision and perfect knowledge
 and understanding will change our perspective and apprecia-
 tion of other people. What instances can you recall in which
 your respect for another person increased when you came to
 understand that person better?


                                                                      11

FURTHER STUDY: Check the word love in your concordance.
Locate texts that demonstrate how love affects human relationships.
For example, "Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins"
(Prov. 10:12; see also 1 John 2:7-11 and Matt. 5:46). Study the word
love as listed in the Index to the Writings of Ellen G. White, which
carries 22 full pages of references for that word.

   Note: First Corinthians 14:14 may be translated: "If I pray in a
tongue, my spirit [mind] prays, but my thought [meaning] is fruit-
less." The word spirit (Greek: pneuma) as used in the Greek Old
Testament (Septuagint; LXX) and in the Greek New Testament often
means "mind," or includes the mind. (See Ex. 28:3; Deut. 34:9;
1 Chron. 28:12; Job 20:3; Matt. 26:41; Rom. 1:9; 8:16; 1 Cor. 2:11.)
The word mind (Greek nous) often means "thought" or "meaning."
(See Isa. 40:13, LXX; Joshua 14:7, LXX; Rom. 11:34; 1 Cor. 1:10;
2:16.) The genuinely Spirit-filled Corinthians who spoke in tongues
understood what they were saying; their minds were operative. But
their thought or meaning was profitless, because no one else under-
stood—unless they or some other person interpreted the language.
The Spirit-filled speaker was not experiencing an uncontrollable
ecstatic state.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Is it easier to see ourselves or others as loving and lovable
     people? If you can't love a person whom you can see, how can
     you love God, whom you cannot see? Do you first tolerate
     people or do you accept them completely as fellow humans
     irrespective of race or religion? Why?

     2. How have you chosen to apply 1 Corinthians 13 to your own
        life? If we all applied Paul's meaningful admonition in
        1 Corinthians 14:1, first part, how would our lives change?
        How would the church change?

SUMMARY: They who pursue money, and money alone, are chas-
ing fantasy—a mirage. They whose quest is for fame and fortune
sooner or later will find that it bursts like a bubble. They whose aims
are no higher than the body and its sensations will close their lives on
a bed of shame and pierce themselves through with heavy sorrows.
But they who seek to love in the highest sense will find it and glory in
it and grow into it increasingly.

Nobel Mission
                            Trophies in Mongolia
       RN'                     Robert S. Folkenberg

            One of the lands that make up the "uttermost parts of the
         earth" has moved a little closer to the rest of the Adventist world
         recently, when the first believers in Outer Mongolia were bap-
         tized.
            Brad and Cathie Jolly and four student missionaries working
         with them (Suzy Baldwin, Tamara Caldeira, Joanne Park, and
         Julien Tristan), make up the Adventist work force in Outer
         Mongolia. These dedicated young people minister in Mongolia
         under the auspices of Adventist Frontier Missions, quietly plant-
         ing the gospel in this previously unentered and politically closed
         country.
             Recently I joined the Jollys in Mongolia to celebrate the first
         baptism of new believers in this corner of the world.
             Friday evening about 45 Mongolian young people gathered
         to celebrate the Lord's Supper. Davaakhuu (Dah-VAH-hu), one
         of the two young women to be baptized the next day, spoke
         about the meaning of Communion. Her joy in the Lord bubbled
         out as she testified to her new-found assurance of salvation.
             On Sabbath morning we met at an indoor swimming pool for
         one of the most moving baptismal services I have ever attended.
         We lifted the new members before God, pleading for the pres-
         ence and power of the Spirit in their lives. Then I had the joy of
         baptizing Davaakhuu and Inkhbayar (INK-by-ar) the first fruits
         of the gospel in Mongolia. During the same ceremony we ac-
         cepted a young man, Inkhtaivan (INK-ti-van), into fellowship
         by profession of faith, bringing the number of Mongolian mem-
         bers to three. It was just after noon, but the regular Sabbath
         activities were just beginning! We began the three-hour Sab-
         bath School and a one-and-a-half-hour church service. Most of
         the presentations were led by the three new members and sev-
         eral others who are studying with the Jollys. The light of God's
         love now warms Mongolia with love and hope.

  The Suffering Son of God




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Isa. 52:13-15; 53:1-12.

     MEMORY TEXT: "All we like sheep have gone astray; we
     have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid
     on him the iniquity of us all" (Isaiah 53:6).

   KEY THOUGHT: The sacrificial death of the Servant-Messiah
has atoned for the sins of all human beings, rendering it possible for
God to make them right with Him.

   THE MESSAGE OF THE CROSS HAS MAGNETIC POWER.
Isaiah 53 has been described as "The Mount Everest of all Old
Testament prophecy concerning Jesus." If Isaiah had stood beneath
the cross of Christ, he could not have more effectively portrayed the
enormity of the sacrifice and the blessedness of its results.
   Adam Clarke summarizes Isaiah 53: "In this chapter the incarna-
tion, preaching, humiliation, rejection, sufferings, death, atonement,
resurrection, and mediation of Jesus Christ are all predicted, together
with the prevalence of his Gospel, and the extension of his kingdom
through all ages."—Commentary on Isaiah 53:12, p. 209.
   "This chapter should be studied. It presents Christ as the Lamb of
God. Those who are lifted up with pride, whose souls are filled with
vanity, should look upon this picture of their Redeemer, and humble
themselves in the dust. The entire chapter should be committed to
memory. Its influence will subdue and humble the soul defiled by sin
and uplifted by self-exaltation."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 1147.

MESSIAH: GOD'S PRUDENT SERVANT (Isa. 52:13-15).

   According to Isaiah 52:13, 14, what role was to characterize
the Messiah? What prophecy is made concerning His destiny?


   In the book of Isaiah, the "servant" is sometimes the Messiah (Isa.
42:1-9; 49:1-7; 52:13-53:12), sometimes Israel (Isa. 41:8, 9; 43:1-
44:23), and sometimes Cyrus, the Persian monarch (Isa. 44:24-46:13).
Throughout Scripture, God's servants are those commissioned to
fulfill His special purposes in the earth. (See Rom. 1:1.) The servant
may be an individual or a nation. The passage we are studying (Isa.
52:13-53:12) predicts that the Servant-Messiah will fulfill God's
transcendent purpose in the earth. By suffering for all human sin, the
Messiah would provide salvation for every human being. Isaiah
introduces his discussion of the Messiah's suffering by speaking of
His subsequent exaltation. Isaiah 52:13 reminds us that Jesus has
been "exalted at the right hand of God" (Acts 2:33, RSV; compare
Phil. 2:9).
   In Isaiah 52:14 the Messiah appears as the suffering servant.
Nowhere in Scripture is there a more vivid presentation of the ter-
rible physical effects of His bearing "our sins in his body on the tree"
(1 Peter 2:24, RSV). "This does not mean that he appears to be more
disfigured than other men, but that . . . he no longer resembled a man.
This is an extremely strong way of saying how great his sufferings
were."—Edward J. Young, The Book of Isaiah (Grand Rapids, Mich.:
Eerdmans, 1972), pp. 337, 338.

   What does the Messiah do for the nations? What is their
reaction? Isa. 52:15.


   "So will he sprinkle many nations" (Isa. 52:15, NIV). In the
ancient sanctuary services, the priests sprinkled the blood of the
sacrifices representing the Messiah; "how much more shall the blood
of Christ . . . purify your conscience from dead works to serve the
living God" (Heb. 9:14, RSV). The power of the blood of Christ
cleanses believing people of all nations from their sin. The Holy
Spirit reveals the mysteries of the gospel to their hearts (1 Cor. 2:9,
10). Those who do not believe will ultimately understand when they
are confronted by the returning King (Matt. 24:30).




                                                                     15

RECEPTION OF THE SUFFERING MESSIAH (Isa. 53:1-3).

   What answer would you give to the questions Isaiah asks? Isa.
53:1 (compare Luke 18:8).


   There is an element of passionate yearning in these questions.
Jesus Himself dramatically expressed it: "0 Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto
thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as
a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!"
(Matt. 23:37).
   Despite all the miracles He had performed, many people did not
believe Jesus was the Messiah. This is exactly what Isaiah the prophet
had predicted. John quoted Isaiah 53:1 (John 12:38). The people to
whom Jesus ministered could not grasp truth, because, as Isaiah had
predicted, "He has blinded their eyes and deadened their hearts, so
they can neither see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts"
(John 12:40, NIV, quoting Isa. 6:10). Understanding comes with
faith. Because many of Jesus' contemporaries refused to believe,
they could not see or accept the truth He shared.

   What did the prophet mean when he described the human
Christ? Was Jesus' person not attractive? Was He unattrac-
tive—a physical weakling? Lacking in personality and charisma?
Isa. 53:1-3.


   "These words do not mean that Christ was unattractive in person.
In the eyes of the Jews, Christ had no beauty that they should desire
Him. They looked for a Messiah who would come with outward
display and worldly glory, one who would do great things for the
Jewish nation, exalting it above every other nation on the earth. But
Christ came with His divinity hidden by the garb of humanity, unob-
trusive, humble, poor. They compared this man with the proud boasts
they had made, and they could see no beauty in Him. They did not
discern the holiness and purity of His character. The grace and virtue
revealed in His life did not appeal to them."—Ellen G. White Com-
ments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 1147.


   How do we discern the holiness and purity of Christ's char-
acter? How does the grace and virtue revealed in His life im-
press us? How does His unobtrusive style affect us?

WHAT THE MESSIAH HAS DONE FOR US (Isa. 53:4-10).

   In what sense did Jesus bear our "griefs" (Isa. 53:4, KJV), or
"infirmities" (NIV)? Matt. 8:17.


   Jesus bore our sicknesses or infirmities in the sense that He healed
the physically sick. Moreover, he took upon Himself our guilt and its
consequences (1 Peter 2:24)—separation from the Father, ultimate
spiritual and mental anguish, and the resulting physical suffering and
death on the cross.
   Consider prayerfully what Christ has done for us: (1) borne our
griefs (Isa. 53:4); (2) carried our sorrows (verse 4); (3) stricken,
smitten of God and afflicted (verse 4); (4) wounded for our transgres-
sions (verse 5); (5) bruised for our iniquities (verse 5); (6) chastised
for our peace (verse 5); (7) suffered stripes (verse 5); (8) bore the
world's iniquity (verses 6, 8); (9) was oppressed and afflicted (verse
7); (10) brought to slaughter as a lamb (verse 7); (11) dumb before
His persecutors (verse 7); (12) taken from prison and judgment
(verse 8); (13) life taken (verse 8); (14) buried with the wicked and
the rich (verse 9).

   Compare the Gospel account of Jesus' trial, suffering, and
death with Isaiah's predictions. Matt. 26:47-67; 27:1, 11-50, 57-
66.


   The Saviour suffered alone. None of His followers defended or
championed His Messiahship. Consider, His griefs were not His
own. The infinite intensity of His suffering resulted from an act of
the Father, who suffered with the Son (2 Cor. 5:19): "The Lord has
laid on him the iniquity of us all" (Isa. 53:6, NIV). "God made him
who had no sin to be sin for us" (2 Cor. 5:21, NIV; compare Isa.
53:10). Willingly the Son accepted the results of all human sin;
willingly, but with a breaking heart, the Father caused the Son to
endure those results.
   "It is for thee that the Son of God consents to bear this burden of
guilt; for thee He spoils the domain of death, and opens the gates of
Paradise. . . . He, the Sin Bearer, endures the wrath of divine justice,
and for thy sake becomes sin itself."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 755,
756.

   How would you describe your feelings at this sight of the
 Deity suffering for your sin?


                                                                      17

SATISFACTION AND VICTORY GUARANTEED (Isa. 53:11).

   What brings satisfaction to God's suffering Son? Isa. 53:10, 11
(compare 1 Thess. 2:19).


   "Ever before Him, Christ saw the result of His mission. . . . By
giving His life for the life of men, He would restore in humanity the
image of God. He would lift us up from the dust, reshape the charac-
ter after the pattern of His own character, and make it beautiful with
His own glory."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 504.

   What does the death of the Servant-Messiah make possible for
believers? Isa. 53:11 (compare Rom. 5:17).


    The New Jewish Publication Society translation of Isaiah 53:11
(second part) reads: "My righteous servant makes the many right-
eous, it is their punishment that he bears." The Hebrew verb to
justify is translated "makes righteous." (Compare also the NRSV and
the Amplified Bible. The Hebrew verb is causitive.) J. A. Ziesler
comments: "It is also possible that because of the vicarious action of
the Servant . . . they are righteous. . . . The Servant may be the cause
not of the accounting righteous, but of the actual being righteous, of
many."—The Meaning of Righteousness in Paul (Cambridge: Uni-
versity Press, 1972), p. 18.
   Of the 41 instances of the verb to justify (tsadaq) in the Hebrew
Old Testament, there is none in which God declares righteous a
person who is not so. Quite the contrary, God says that He will not
justify the wicked, and He commands human judges to follow His
example. (See Ex. 23:7; Deut. 25:1; 1 Kings 8:32; Prov. 17:15; Isa.
5:22, 23.) But note that God does not justify the righteous person as a
meritorious reward for good ethical conduct. He justifies a person
because of his or her covenant relationship with Himself that will be
expressed in good ethical conduct. Justification is a legal declaration
of the transformation of heart brought about by covenant fellowship
with God.
   In Isaiah 53: lithe Lord (the Messiah) justifies in the sense of
acquitting or declaring righteous those who have accepted His vicari-
ous sacrifice and have entered into personal fellowship with Him.
They are accounted righteous because the righteous Servant has
made them so. Not only did He bear their iniquity, but He made them
whole by healing them of their spiritual and ethical disease.

REWARD OF HIS SACRIFICE AND INTERVENTION (Isa.
53:12).

   How will Jesus share His reward with His people? How will
He divide "the spoil" with us? What makes all of this bestowal of
gifts possible? Isa. 53:12 (compare Rev. 7:9-17).

   The Messiah could never receive "a portion among the great," nor
could He "divide the spoils with the strong" (Isa. 53:12, NIV) unless
He rose from the dead. The text implies the resurrection of Christ.
"And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in
your sins. . . . But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead"
(1 Cor. 15:17, 20, NIV).
   The magnificent truth is that Christ shares His victory with His
believing people. "Assuredly, I will give him the many as his portion,
He shall receive the multitude as his spoil" (Isa. 53:12, JPS). For us
to be Christ's for eternity will be the greatest reward both for Him
and for us. (See Mark 10:28-31.)
   Isaiah reiterated the basis of our salvation: "He poured out His
soul unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors. For he
bore the sin of many" (Isa. 53:12, NIV; compare 1 Peter 3:18; Heb.
9:28; 1 John 2:2; 4:10). "Justice demands that sin be not merely
pardoned, but the death penalty must be executed. God, in the gift of
His only-begotten Son, met both these requirements. By dying in
man's stead, Christ exhausted the penalty and provided a pardon."
 —Selected Messages, book 1, p. 340.

  How does the Messiah make the benefits of His sacrifice im-
mediately available to believers? Isa. 53:12 (last part).

   Christ is our Mediator and High Priest in the heavenly sanctuary.
(See 1 Tim. 2:5, 6; Heb. 7:23-27.) When at His ascension He began
His heavenly ministry of intercession for sinners, He poured out His
Spirit upon His people so that His indwelling presence would pro-
vide the enabling power for their victory over sin. (See Acts 2:37-39;
Rom. 8:1-4.)
   Thus Isaiah 53 speaks of the death, burial, resurrection, ascension,
and heavenly intercessory ministry of Jesus Christ. Because of His
wonderful gift, all that sin has lost, Christ will restore.

    How could you briefly explain to your neighbor the signifi-
 cance of Christ's death? Perhaps you could rehearse your ex-
 planation in Sabbath School class.

                                                                        19

FURTHER STUDY: In Scripture Christ the Saviour is represented
as wonderful (Isa. 9:6); an unspeakable gift (2 Cor. 9:15); the captain
of salvation (Heb. 2:10); the power of God (1 Cor. 1:24); Emmanuel
(Matt. 1:23); the friend of publicans and sinners (Luke 7:34); the
great High Priest (Heb. 4:14); the Lamb of God (John 1:36); the Lord
our righteousness (Jer. 23:6); the Lord your redeemer (Isa. 43:14);
the Messiah (John 4:25, 26).
   Read the following statements that speak of the gift of Christ's
righteousness to us:
   "Abundant grace has been provided that the believing soul may be
kept free from sin; for all heaven, with its limitless resources, has
been placed at our command. We are to draw from the well of
salvation. Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone
who believeth. In ourselves we are sinners; but in Christ we are
righteous. Having made us righteous through the imputed righteous-
ness of Christ, God pronounces us just, and treats us as just."
—Selected Messages, book 1, p. 394.
   "Christ has become our sacrifice and surety. He has become sin
for us that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.
Through faith in His name He imputes unto us His righteousness,
and it becomes a living principle in our life. . . . Christ imputes to us
His sinless character and presents us to the Father in His own pu-
rity."—That I May Know Him, p. 302. (Italics supplied.)

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Could Christ have saved us without the sacrifice He made?
     Would it have been sufficient for Him merely to show how to
     live and how to die? Why is the legal aspect of the atonement
     vital to our salvation?

     2. What is the main barrier to our being drawn to the Saviour? Is
        it our own bad habits and character weaknesses? Is it the cross
        that Jesus offers us to bear? What keeps people from coming
        to Christ?

SUMMARY: Isaiah's prophecy in chapter 53 is the explosive reality
of God's truth about the mission of the coming Messiah. It blows to
fragments the Israelite conception of a war-hero Saviour who would
emancipate the captive Jews and destroy the power of Rome. And it
explodes the idea that humanity can be given salvation without a
substitutionary sacrifice. It presents instead the suffering Saviour
dedicated to bearing the sins of the whole world and thrilled to
bestow eternal life on those who accept Him.

                        One Pastor, 1,030 Baptisms
                                Alejandro Bull&

            Carlos Franca, a young pastor in the North Brazilian Union,
         has not yet been ordained. However, during one year he led
         1,030 persons to the Lord in the South American Division.
            This young man has a special talent to organize and plan. He
         has placed his life in God's hands, and through Him, Pastor
         Franca has accomplished much in the three years since he began
         working.
            To reach people for Christ, Pastor Franca uses family-based
         Bible study groups and baptismal classes. Some 300 informal
         family groups study a series of Bible lessons called La Verdad,
         or "The Truth." Members work together to interest their neigh-
         bors, family, and friends. In these informal groups, interested
         persons have their first major contact with our message through
         the Bible lessons.
            After they finish the Bible lessons they are invited to attend
         baptismal classes. In his district of 10 churches, Pastor Franca
         conducted 30 baptismal classes for young people, adults, and
         juniors in one year.
            Pastor Franca held leadership training seminars for family
         and baptismal study group leaders. He challenged and inspired
         them, and then he placed the Bible lessons in their hands.
            During the year he keeps busy visiting and encouraging the
         groups. With special authorization of the church, he has bap-
         tized his candidates. Early in the year he performed baptisms
         weekly, but near the end of the year, he had to schedule bap-
         tisms daily.
            Today his district has grown from 10 to 29 churches, each
         church adopting the family group and baptismal class method as
         a permanent outreach feature.
             Pastor Franca uses no complicated plans, no new or costly
                                methods. His method is simple and direct,
                                but the results are thrilling.




                                  Alejandro Bullim is the Global Mission

             God's Honor Roll




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Heb. 10:35-37; 11:1-40;
12:1, 2.

     MEMORY TEXT: "These all died in faith, not having re-
     ceived the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were
     persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that
     they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth" (Hebrews
     11:13).


   KEY THOUGHT: Faith in God, resulting in works acceptable to
Him, is an essential response for those preparing to be citizens of the
city Christ is preparing.

   THE CONTEXT OF HEBREWS 11 enhances the enormous
significance of the chapter. Previous chapters emphasize that Christ's
death, resurrection, and heavenly ministry have replaced the Old
Testament sanctuary services. Through the blood of Christ we have
immediate access to the presence of God. Our past sins can be
forgiven. Christ gives us His perfection while we continue to grow in
holiness (Heb. 10:14). Amid the struggles of life our confidence in
Christ must remain unshaken (Heb. 10:35-39).
   As an encouragement for us to persevere (Heb. 12:1, 2), the
Epistle to the Hebrews, chapter 11, presents in 40 verses the stunning
exploits of faith in the lives of twelve Bible heroes and heroines
including Sara, the wife of Abraham, and Rahab, of Jericho. Five
stalwart warriors, as well as Samuel and the prophets, are given
honorable mention. Thousands of Christians have passed through the
pain of persecution. By faith they conquered, knowing that in later
generations men and women of faith also would be victorious.

HOW TO OBTAIN A GOOD REPORT (Heb. 11:1-7, 39, 40).

  The elders in Zion obtained a good report ("testimony," NKJV).
How did this come about? Through faith. The truly great men and
women of Bible times, and all time, have been champions of faith in
God and His Word. (See 1 John 5:4.)

   What is faith said to be? Heb. 11:1. How does verse 3 illustrate
faith at work?


   Hebrews 11:1 reads in the Amplified Bible: "Now faith is the
assurance (the confirmation, the title-deed) of the things [we] hope
for, being the proof of things [we] do not see and the conviction of
their reality—faith perceiving as real fact what is not revealed to the
senses."
   "Faith is trusting in God—believing that He loves us, and knows
what is for our best good. Thus, instead of our own way, it leads us to
choose His way. In place of our ignorance, it accepts His wisdom; in
place of our weakness, His strength; in place of our sinfulness, His
righteousness. Our lives, ourselves, are already His; faith acknowl-
edges His ownership, and accepts its blessing. Truth, uprightness,
purity, are pointed out as secrets of life's success. It is faith that puts
us in possession of these."—The Faith I live By, p. 90.

   As you read Hebrews 11:1-34, think of at least one act of each
of the saints that required heroic faith. Then identify some New
Testament believers (women and men) who could also qualify for
God's honor roll.


   What did the works of Abel, Enoch, and Noah demonstrate?
Heb. 11:4, 5, 7. What kind of faith pleases God? Why? Heb. 11:6
(compare Gal. 5:6).


   The great faith of men and women of the past manifested itself in
great deeds. Hebrews 11 illustrates James's point that living faith
always results in good works (James 2:14-26). The patriarchs were
accounted righteous, not because their works earned righteousness,
but because, having believed, they received the gift of God's right-
eousness as the inner power to serve Him.

   If you don't have the kind of faith described in Hebrews 11,
 how should you go about getting it? (See John 20:31.)

                                                                        23
Monday                                              January 16
THE FAITH OF ABRAHAM AND SARAH (Heb. 11:8-19).

  On Abraham's journey to Canaan, what prospect thrilled his
soul? Heb. 11:8, 9, 13-16.


   How encouraging that Abraham's motivation in moving to Canaan
was not worldly wealth and control of real estate! His concern was to
show his complete trust in God, who was preparing for him a city
(verse 10), the "better country" (verse 16).

   How did Abraham's faith in God's promises affect both his
standing with God and his spiritual state? Rom. 4:1-5; Gal. 3:6-9,
14. By what painful act did God ask Abraham to demonstrate his
standing and state? Heb. 11:17-19.


    There can be no justification without faith. Abel trusted in the
blood of Christ and was accounted and made righteous. Enoch pleased
God by his faith attachment to Christ, and he walked with the Invis-
ible. In the eyes of a righteous God, Noah became heir of the right-
eousness that is by faith. Abraham was righteous in God's sight
because his faith worked, and he went out to the Promised Land not
knowing whither he went. Later he obeyed the divine summons to
offer his son as a sacrifice. His actions did not save his soul, but they
demonstrated the faith of a man accepted by God. We are justified by
faith alone, but we will be judged by our works, which represent God
at work in and through us (2 Cor. 5:10; Rev. 20:12; 22:12).

     What test of faith came to Sarah? Heb. 11:11, 12.


   The miraculous birth followed the ordinary processes of childbearing:
conception, pregnancy, the birth of a son. It all happened through
Sarah's response of faith to God's command and promise. Sarah first
laughed at the idea of having a baby at the age of 90 (Gen. 18:9-15),
but when conception occurred and she began to show signs of
childbearing, her friends could exclaim, "Isn't it wonderful what God
can do for an old woman who has faith in Him!"

  How valid is our claim to faith when we refuse to give up
something or someone God asks us to separate from?

FAITH EXPRESSED IN PROPHETIC UTTERANCES (Heb.
11:20-22).

   By faith Isaac blessed his twin sons concerning things to come
(Heb. 11:20). Esau's blessing is recorded in Genesis 27:38-40; Jacob's
blessing is recorded in Genesis 27:26-29; 28:1-5.

   Considering the outrageous and deceptive behavior of Jacob
and the perverse nature of his brother, Esau, would you say that
either deserved a blessing from the Lord? Why? See Genesis 27
and 28. If Jacob was no more worthy than Esau, why did the
Lord favor him (Rom. 9:10-13)? Are we any more worthy of
God's favors? If not, why does the Lord bless us?


   God's grace is larger than human failures. The blessings of Isaac
were really prophetic utterances of things to come. Isaac had faith
that the word of the Lord he proclaimed would come to pass, and it
did! Jacob's life changed for the better, while Esau remained ada-
mant in his pattern of evildoing, as the Lord had predicted. And
through Jacob, the seed of Isaac, came Jesus the promised Saviour.
How wonderful the providences and foreknowledge of God! (See
Rom. 11:33.) And how great the faith of Isaac!
   Joseph asked his father, Jacob, to bless his two sons, Manasseh
and Ephraim, and he did so under prophetic inspiration (Gen. 48:11-
22). Jacob was 147 years old, a tottering elderly man, but his faith
was unmoved. He uttered prophetic blessings without wavering. He
knew that, in His own time, God would fulfill the predictions.
   As Esau, the firstborn of Isaac, and Jacob exchanged places, in the
providence of God, so did Manasseh, the firstborn, with his brother
Ephraim. Esau and Manasseh would prove to be unworthy; Ephraim
and Jacob proved to be worthy. God knows what He is doing. Do you
ever question God's dealings in your life? Do you ever wonder how
things will turn out, considering all the problems? Faith enables us to
envision success while our humanity visualizes only failure.

    Review other scriptures indicating that God uses godly people
 who have faith as He unfolds future events through them:
 Amos 3:7; 2 Peter 1:19-21; Luke 1:26-31, 39-45. The prophets
 who received revelations from God were men and women of
 faith.




                                                                     25

 MOSES, HIS PARENTS, AND RAHAB (Heb. 11:23-31).

   Discuss the exploits of faith recorded in Hebrews 11:23-31.
 How did faith enter the picture in each instance?

 Moses' parents (verse 23)

 Moses (verses 24-29)

 Joshua (verse 30)

 Rahab (verse 31)

    Compare Moses' life of faith and self-renunciation with that
 of our Lord Jesus. Compare Heb. 11:24-29 with Phil. 2:4-11.


     "Moses was a type of Christ. As Israel's intercessor veiled his
 countenance, because the people could not endure to look upon its
 glory, so Christ, the divine Mediator, veiled His divinity with hu-
* manity when He came to earth. Had He come clothed with the
 brightness of heaven, He could not have found access to men in their
 sinful state. They could not have endured the glory of His presence.
 Therefore He humbled Himself, and was made 'in the likeness of
 sinful flesh' (Romans 8:3), that He might reach the fallen race, and
 lift them up."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 330.

   What act of faith distinguished Rahab, the harlot, and with
 what result? Heb. 11:30, 31; Joshua 2:1-18; 6:17-25.


    What casual Hebrew observer would have detected the heart of
 faith beneath the disguise of a prostitute! We look on the outward
 appearance; God looks on the heart. Boaz, an ancestor of Christ, took
 Ruth the Moabitess to be his wife. Boaz was the son of Salmon, "by
 Rahab" (Matt. 1:5). Matthew states that Jesus descended directly
 from Rahab, a reformed harlot, and Ruth, a Moabitess. The important
 thing with God is the heart of faith. Glory is given to the Father and
 the Son when lives are transformed by grace. We can only stand in
 awe and wonder at what God can do when people believe and obey
 Him!

    What would it mean for you to bear your cross in life as
 faithfully as Moses bore his?

SIX HEROES OF FAITH (Heb. 11:32-40).

   What common occupation distinguished the six heroes men-
tioned in Hebrews 11:32? Name two common traits of character.
What will these characteristics do for God's people today?


   Are the experiences described in Hebrews 11:33-38 intended
to be purely historical? What application do these verses have for
God's last-day people?


   In this chapter, faith shines like a jewel with many polished facets.
Twenty-two episodes gleam with the power and beauty of faith. Faith
is portrayed as an experience. Hebrews 11 reveals the principle that
God's Word was cherished more dearly than anything life could
bring to His faithful servants. Each situation, if studied in context,
demonstrates a test between God's will and someone else's will. This
honor roll shows that God does not forget His loyal subjects. Their
reward still awaits them and all others who place implicit trust in
their Creator and Redeemer.

   What glorious cloud encompasses God's children? What three
things should we do? Heb. 12:1, 2. What is the secret of success?
Verses 2-4 (see also Heb. 11:39, 40).


   "We are homeward bound. A little longer and the strife will be
over. May we who stand in the heat of the conflict, ever keep before
us a vision of things unseen—of that time when the world will be
bathed in the light of heaven, when the years will move on in
gladness, when over the scene the morning stars will sing together
and the sons of God will shout for joy, while God and Christ will
unite in proclaiming, 'There shall be no more sin, neither shall there
be any more death.' Forgetting those things which are behind, and
reaching forth unto those things which are before,' let us 'press
toward the mark of the prize of the high calling of God in Christ
Jesus.' "—Ellen G. White (a message Ellen G. White placed in gift
copies of her books).

    If a murderer and adulterer (David), a deceiver and liar
 (Jacob), and a prostitute (Rahab) conquered their evil desires
 by faith in God, is there hope for us? Why? Wherein lies the
 victory? (See 1 John 5:2-5.)


                                                                     27

FURTHER STUDY: How would you explain Matthew 17:20 and
Mark 9:23? Under what circumstances are these promises fulfilled to
us? Read: "An Impressive Dream" in Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 594-
597; "Faith and Acceptance" in Steps to Christ, pp. 49-55.

   Hebrews 10:35-37 has special meaning for Seventh-day
Adventists. As we face the future, increasingly aware of Bible
prophecy being fulfilled by events in the world and in the church,
what could be more reassuring? "Therefore do not throw away your
confidence, which has a great reward. For you have need of endur-
ance, so that you may do the will of God and receive what is
promised. Tor yet a little while, and the coming one shall come and
shall not tarry; but my righteous one shall live by faith, and if he
shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him.' But we are not of
those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith
and keep their souls" (Heb. 10:35-39, RSV). Because Christ is com-
ing very soon, our faith in His appearing must grow stronger every
day.

 QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION:
  1. Illustrate how you would distinguish between faith and pre-
      sumption.

     2. Is faith natural to our human nature like memory or judgment,
        or is it a gift of God? (See Eph. 2:8.)

     3. How can you tell how much faith you actually have?

     4. If God's Word bids you live in a certain way and you offer
        excuses or refuse, what is the real reason for your attitude?

     5. The characters of Hebrews 11 overcame by faith. What would
        hinder us from having our names registered in God's great
        honor roll?

SUMMARY: Faith is a gift of the Holy Spirit. Hebrews 11 provides
illustrations of how men and women of God in past ages held to the
faith steadfastly, though tried by persecution. Much of the Old Testa-
ment delineates exploits of faith that provide excellent models for us
in these last days of earth's history.

WNW Missies                       KaFuMa
   N;51-1W                     James H. Zachary

           Brother Henderson had learned his lessons well. After six
       weeks at the lay training school in Papua, New Guinea, he began
       holding Bible studies. Each week this energetic layman hiked
       eight kilometers (five miles) to lead a Bible study at KaFuMa.
       This was the third new church that he had planted since he
       completed his training.
           Brother Henderson stood in front of a partly-completed jungle-
       style church. More than 200 people sat on the ground, listening
       to Henderson's lively presentation. The candidates for baptism
       had built this sanctuary for the new congregation that would be
       organized following their baptism. Candidates were Sabbath
       School members for at least one year before they could be
       baptized. This year would be spent establishing them in a new
       life in Jesus.
           The construction had been hard work. They cut poles from
       the forest and gathered jungle vines to tie poles together. Next
       they would construct the benches from similar poles, then gather
       grass and dry it for the roof.
           As the Bible study closed, we gathered around a table laden
       with tropical fruits. As we ate, one of the tribesmen told me the
       story of the new church.
           "We are three clans living in this valley. Since the days of our
       forefathers we fought and killed one another."
           Another man joined in the conversation. Pointing to their
       teacher, he said, "Then Henderson came. He invited us to study
       the messages from the God in the sky. We have learned many




      •ri
       things from the holy book. We have accepted Jesus and his new
       way of life."
           The first tribesman continued, "Our three clans are friends
       now. We are now one in Jesus," he said with a smile. "There
        will be peace in this valley now. We will not fight anymore."
                                  The tribes have named their new church
                              KaFuMa, taken from the first syllable of
                              each clan's name. Jesus transforms men
                               and women. An old way of life comes to
                               an end. KaFuMa testifies to that.

              In the Beginning




Sabbath Afternoon:
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Gen. 1:1-31; 2:1-4; Ps.
33:6-9.

     MEMORY TEXT: "In the beginning God created the heaven
     and the earth" (Genesis 1:1).

  KEY THOUGHT: God is the Creator and the Re-Creator. Just as
He created the world out of nothing, so He creates spiritual life for
human beings from a spiritual void.

   GOD CREATED THE UNIVERSE AND ITS INHABITANTS.
Genesis chapter 1 records that our world, with its plant life, animal
life, and human life, was created in six days. Some of the Bible
passages that refer to God's creative work are as follows:
   "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. And the
earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the
deep; and the Spirit of God was moving over the surface of the
waters" (Gen. 1:1, 2, NASB).
   "For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea
and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the
Lord blessed the sabbath day and made it holy" (Ex. 20:11, NASB).
   "You alone are the Lord. You made the heavens, even the highest
heavens, and all their starry host, the earth and all that is on it, the
seas and all that is in them" (Neh. 9:6, NIV).
   "In the beginning you laid the foundations of the earth, and the
heavens are the work of your hands" (Ps. 102:25, NIV).
   "By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the
word of God, so that what is seen was made from things that are not
visible" (Heb. 11:3, NRSV).

PLANET EARTH—GOD'S CREATION (Gen. 1:1, 2).

   In what classic-but-simple language does the author of Gen-
esis describe the origin of our world and the heavens? Gen. 1:1.


   "The work of creation can never be explained by science. What
science can explain the mystery of life?
   "The theory that God did not create matter when He brought the
world into existence is without foundation. In the formation of our
world, God was not indebted to pre-existing matter. On the contrary,
all things, material or spiritual, stood up before the Lord Jehovah at
His voice and were created for His own purpose. The heavens and all
the host of them, the earth and all things therein, are not only the
work of His hand; they came into existence by the breath of His
mouth."—Testimonies, vol. 8, pp. 258, 259.
    God first invented or planned the universe. Then, by His miracu-
lous power, He put His plan into action.

   How does "God the Lord" identify Himself? Isa. 42:5; 40:28
(compare Isa. 40:12-22, 25, 26).


  God's work was to make tangible objects out of nothing, things
out of no thing. God changed the nature of physical elements when
He breathed life into Adam (Gen. 2:7). This requires the same divine
energy as to create the universe out of nothing. God also creates new
hearts in human beings; He re-creates. David prayed, "Create in me a
pure heart, 0 God" (Ps. 51:10, NIV). All of these creative acts are
miracles of which the divine Creator alone is capable.

  Who was active in the creation of our world? Gen. 1:2; Ps.
104:30; John 1:1-4; Heb. 1:1, 2; Col. 1:15-17.


   Just as all three Persons of the Godhead shared in the work of
Creation, all three are involved in re-creation. All three Persons of
the Godhead are interested in the redemption of lost man, his restora-
tion to the divine image. In this sense creation is still going on. The
creative energy and power of God is needed in every life every day.

    Under what circumstances will God answer us when we
 pray David's prayer recorded in Psalm 51:10? What is the role
 of faith as we consider the Creation account and as we ap-
 proach God for re-creation? (See Heb. 11:1-6.)
                                                                    31

ORIGIN OF DAY AND NIGHT (Gen. 1:3-5).

  What was the source of the light that illuminated the earth
during the first three days of Creation? Gen. 1:3-5 (compare Ps.
104:1-5). How does spiritual light come to sinful human beings?
John 1:9-13.


    The Lord is the source of both natural and spiritual light. "For
God, who said, 'let light shine out of darkness,' made his light shine
in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God
in the face of Christ" (2 Cor. 4:6, NIV). "God is light; in him there is
no darkness at all" (1 John 1:5, NIV).

   Since we cannot explain Creation or any of God's miraculous
works (Rom. 11:33), why should we trust Him as the source of
truth and spiritual light? Isa. 50:7-10; Ps. 32:10.


   How can we demonstrate from Genesis 1 and 2 that life as we
know it was not created over millions (or even billions) of years,
and that it did not evolve? Gen. 1:5, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31; 2:1-3
(compare Ex. 20:8-11).


   "The days of the Bible's Creation account signify literal 24-hour
periods. Typical of how the Old Testament people of God measured
time, the expression 'the evening and the morning' (Gen. 1:5, 8, 13,
19, 23, 31) specifies individual days with the day beginning at evening,
or sunset (see Lev. 23:32; Deut. 16:6). There is no justification for
saying that this expression meant one literal day in Leviticus and
thousands or millions of years in Genesis.
   "The Hebrew word translated day in Genesis 1 is yom. When yom
is accompanied by a definite number, it always means a literal, 24-
hour day (e.g. Gen. 7:11; Ex. 16:1)—another indication that the
Creation account speaks of literal, twenty-four-hour days."
—Seventh-day Adventists Believe (Hagerstown, Md.: Review and
Herald, 1988), p. 71.
   If each day preceding the Sabbath was a long period of time, the
Sabbath must have been also. But the Sabbath commandment in-
structs that the seventh-day Sabbath be observed, "for in six days the
Lord made the heavens and the earth" (Ex. 20:11; compare 31:17).
Because the Sabbath is a 24-hour period, so are the days of Creation
week that the Sabbath memorializes. (See Patriarchs and Prophets,
p. 112.)

THE FIRMAMENT, THE SEA, AND THE DRY LAND (Gen.
1:6-13).

  What is the firmament? Gen 1:7, 8 (compare the use of the
word in verses 14, 15, 17, 20; Ps. 19:1).


  How did the Lord work in arranging the surface of the earth?
Gen. 1:9, 10.


    In Genesis 1:6-10 we see the bountiful Divider at work. First He
divides night from day; then He divides the waters on the earth from the
clouds and vapors above the earth. Thus there is created the vast expanse
of the sky, or the firmament. Here God anticipates a magnificent habitat
for the fowls of the air. Our atmosphere comes into being, which the
astronauts tell us wraps our earth in a cocoon of blue. The firmament
consists of air. Sufficient space exists for birds to fly and, in our time, for
jet planes to streak across the skies. Then comes the gathering together of
waters, creating seas. Then dry land appears.

   What occurs next in the unfolding drama of Creation? Gen.
1:11, 12.


   God gave names to the elements of His creation on days one to
three: Light equals day; darkness equals night; firmament equals
heaven; water equals sea; land equals earth. On the sixth day Adam
gave names to the living creatures upon the earth.
    From what source did Adam draw to frame appropriate names for
both fauna and flora? How could this be when Adam had little time
to study or premeditate? And what about noxious plants?
   "Not one noxious plant was placed in the Lord's great garden, but
after Adam and Eve sinned, poisonous herbs sprang up. In the par-
able of the sower the question was asked the master, `Didst not thou
sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?' The
master answered, 'An enemy hath done this' (Matt. 13:27, 28). All
tares are sown by the evil one. Every noxious herb is of his sowing,
and by his ingenious methods of amalgamation he has corrupted the
earth with tares."—Selected Messages, book 2, p. 288. (See Temper-
ance, p. 75.)

    What is the difference between the way we treat noxious
 plants in our gardens and the manner in which we treat "tares"
 in the church? (See Matt. 13:30.)

                                                                             33

THE FOURTH DAY (Gen. 1:14-19).

  Since the firmament refers to the atmospheric heavens, how
can we explain Genesis 1:14, 17?


   "The expression that they [sun, moon, and stars] are set in the
firmament, or expanse of heaven, is chosen because it is there that
the earthly inhabitant sees them."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1,
p. 212.

     When were the stars created? Gen. 1:16 (last part).


   "He made the stars also. The words, 'he made,' have been
supplied. As to the origin of the stars two principal views have been
set forth: (1) The stars were brought into existence during creation
week, along with the sun and moon. (2) The 'stars,' though created
earlier, are here mentioned, in passing, by Moses, inasmuch as he is
discussing the luminaries of the heavens. The first view necessitates
the conclusion that prior to creation week the vast universe was an
empty void. This conclusion seems unwarranted.
   "However, on this as on many other cryptic declarations of Scrip-
ture regarding God's mysterious acts, we should be slow to dogma-
tize. We should not forget that the primary truth Moses sought to
present in regard to the origin of the sun, moon, and stars is that all
are the result of God's creative power. Here is a further refutation of
the ancient but ever-recurring heresy of the eternity of matter."
—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 213.

   Why did people begin to worship the heavenly bodies? What
were the results of sun worship in Israel? 2 Kings 21:3, 5; Jer.
8:1, 2.


    The idolatry of worshiping the heavenly bodies denied the Lord's
claims and requirements. The Lord warned His people of the dire
results of worshiping the sun, moon, and stars (Deut. 4:19, 24).
    Scripture sometimes presents the sun and light as symbols of
Christ. (See Mal. 4:2; John 8:12; Rev. 21:23.) Excluding Him from
our lives by substituting things or persons as objects of our adoration
is idolatry as objectionable to God as was that of our ancestors.

    What other objects of God's creation has Satan transformed
 into objects of worship?

CREATOR VERSUS CREATURE WORSHIP (Gen. 1:20-25).

  How did God arrange for birds, fish, and animals to repro-
duce only within their basic types? Gen. 1:20-22, 24-25.


   The laws of genetics were implanted into each living creature by
God Himself. The obvious divine intention was that each broad kind
of animal should reproduce others of the same kind with only minor
variations within the basic type. Birds and animals do not evolve into
other kinds of life. Cats do not become dogs; fish do not become land
animals. Moreover, there is no evolution from lower to higher forms
of life.

   How would you describe the human beings who came forth
from the hand of the Creator? Gen. 1:26-28; 2:7, 18, 21-25.


   "God created man in His own image. Here is no mystery. There is
no ground for the supposition that man was evolved by slow degrees
of development from the lower forms of animal or vegetable life.
Such teaching lowers the great work of the Creator to the level of
man's narrow, earthly conceptions. Men are so intent upon excluding
God from the sovereignty of the universe that they degrade man and
defraud him of the dignity of his origin. . . . Man was to bear God's
image, both in outward resemblance and in character."—Patriarchs
and Prophets, p. 45.

   What has happened to the noble being God created? Eccl.
7:29; Rom. 5:12-21; 7:14, 15, 18, 19. The tendency throughout
history has been for humans to substitute creature-worship for
Creator-worship. What have been the dire results? Rom. 1:21-
32.


   What perpetual memorial of Creation did God give as a bar-
rier against false modes of worship? Gen. 2:1-3.


   If humans had faithfully observed the Sabbath, there would have
been no idolatry. False systems of worship would never have arisen,
and substitutes for the Sabbath would have been rejected. The
seventh-day Sabbath that God instituted at Creation and that Christ
observed while on earth (Luke 4:16; Matt. 24:20) was designed to
keep human beings in close fellowship with their Creator.
                                                                    35

FURTHER STUDY: Study John 1:1-3, 14; Rom. 1:20; Col. 1:12-

    "Seventh-day Adventists believe God is Creator of all things, and
has revealed in Scripture the authentic account of His creative activ-
ity. In six days the Lord made 'the heaven and the earth' and all
living things upon the earth, and rested on the seventh day of that
first week. Thus He established the Sabbath as a perpetual memorial
of His completed creative work. The first man and woman were
made in the image of God as the crowning work of Creation, given
dominion over the world, and charged with responsibility to care for
it. When the world was finished it was 'very good,' declaring the
glory of God."—Seventh-day Adventists Believe, p. 68.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How does a strict belief in a literal Creation affect one's belief
     in Christ and the power of His word?

     2. If one believes the view that humanity's development sprang
        from lower forms, with God guiding the process, what is the
        effect upon one's understanding of Scripture? For example,
        how does the fall of humanity into sin relate to this view?
        What is the significance of the Sabbath, if this view is held?

     3. If God, the Creator, is all-powerful, can He not create a world
        in a split-second of time? Why did He take six days and nights
        to create our world and its first inhabitants?

     4. How would you explain to a nonbelieving friend that the
        observance of the seventh-day Sabbath contributes to faith in
        the Genesis 1 account of Creation?

SUMMARY: The creation of the world and all things in it was the
work of the Creator-God, who made many things out of nothing. It
was fiat-creation. "For he spoke, and it came to be; he commanded,
and it stood firm" (Ps. 33:9, NIV). Not only mighty life-giving
power, but His love and wisdom were on display before the universe.
In a week's time the glorious earth appeared with the seventh-day
Sabbath to memorialize it, and man and woman upon it to exercise,
under God, sovereign rights over all the creation.

Mobil 1111111141N1          Sermon in the Flax Field
     1  ) this
              At a recent youth congress in Romania, a young man related
               testimony:
              One day when I was 8 years old I went with my father to his
          work as a builder. He was working near a fenced-in field of flax
          where women from a nearby prison were working.
              Soon I became bored and wandered toward the fenced field.
          I began to pretend I was conducting a church service. I sang
          songs and preached a sermon to an imaginary audience.
              Unknown to me, one of the women prisoners was watching
          me. When I saw her I became frightened. But she asked softly,
          "Are you a Christian?"
              "Yes," I answered.
              "Sing more," she said. I sang for her, then told her the story
          of the prodigal son and how Jesus died on the cross for us. She
          began to cry and told me her child had died and that she had
          been blamed for its murder. She asked me to wait while she
          brought a friend. When she returned with her friend she asked
          for more songs and stories. They listened eagerly, then asked
          me to return to the fence the next day. They also asked me to
          bring them a Bible.
              The next day they were waiting at the fence when I arrived.
           They had brought other women and even a guard. I told them
           more stories about the love of Jesus. Then I quickly slipped the
           woman the New Testament that my father had given me.
              I returned to the fence several more days, but the women's
           work was done, and they never returned.
              Several years passed, and as a young man I was going from
           door to door inviting people to a Revelation Seminar. At one
           house the woman invited me in. She began to tell me about the
           first time she heard about the love of Jesus.
               As I listened to her story, I realized this was the same woman
           who had heard my sermon in the flax field years earlier! When I
           told her that I was that boy, she excitedly ran from the room,
           returning with the now-worn New Testament I had given her!
           She told me of five other women who had been converted in
           that prison because of my witness.
               This woman attended every meeting of the Revelation Semi-
           nar, and when it was over she declared, " 'As for me and my
           house we will serve the Lord' (Joshua 24:5)."

             God's Ten Eternal
                Principles




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ex. 19:1-25; 20:1-26.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice
     indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar
     treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine"
     (Exodus 19:5).


   KEY THOUGHT: God's eternal law of love (James 2:8-12)
attracts us to the love and justice of the Lawgiver Himself.

   THE TEN COMMANDMENTS ARE A PERPETUAL RE-
MINDER. Maxie D. Dunnam recounts that, during the days of the
American gold rush, a young man's bride became ill and died before
they could reach Fort Kearney in Nebraska. Heartbroken, the young
man took her body to the highest hill and buried it, using the wagon
bed to make a coffin. He drove down some wooden stakes to mark
the grave, thinking that he would go on West and come back later.
But he could not go on. He went back to St. Louis, Missouri, where
he had a stonecutter prepare a tombstone engraved with the name
"Susan Hale." Not able to persuade anyone to haul it to Nebraska for
him, he put the stone in a wheelbarrow, and pushed it all the way to
Fort Kearney, where he set it up on her grave.
   "Thus it is with Mount Sinai and the Ten Commandments. The
Ten Commandments have been set up for us so that we will never
forget the importance of some things. We keep coming back to them,
for they speak to us of eternal truths and values."—Maxie D. Dunnam,
The Communicator's Commentary: Exodus (Waco, Tex.: Word Books,
1987), pp. 249, 250.

THE SETTING FOR THE PROCLAMATION OF GOD'S LAW
(Ex. 19:1-25).

   In the third month after the Exodus from Egypt the multitudes of
Israel arrived at Mount Sinai and camped there (Ex. 19:1, 2). God
called Moses up into the mount to receive instruction (verse 3).

   What words of covenant relationship did the Lord give Moses
for the elders and the people? Ex. 19:3-6. How did the people
respond? Verses 7, 8. Do you think they meant what they said?
Were they able to keep their covenant promise? Why? See Heb.
8:6-12; Rom. 8:3, 4.


   The same covenant promises God offered Abraham, He offered to
his descendants at Sinai. (See Gen 17:7, 9, 19; Gal. 3:15-17.) But the
people's response was faulty; their hearts were not in their words.
The Lord said to Moses, "0 that there were such an heart in them,
that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always"
(Deut. 5:29; compare Heb. 8:8-10).
   "The covenant that God made with His people at Sinai is to be our
refuge and defense. . . . This covenant is of just as much force today
as it was when the Lord made it with ancient Israel."—Ellen G.
White, The Southern Watchman, March 1, 1904.

  What terrifying experience followed? Ex. 19:16-25 (compare
Heb. 12:18-21). Why did God give Israel this dramatic display of
His power and majesty? Deut. 4:9-16.


   "So terrible were the tokens of Jehovah's presence that the hosts
of Israel shook with fear, and fell upon their faces before the Lord.
Even Moses exclaimed, 'I exceedingly fear and quake.' "—Patri-
archs and Prophets, p. 304.
   God's presence on the mount was glorious and spectacular. The
people froze with fear at the sight. Boundaries had been set to keep
man and beast at a safe distance from the sacred ground of Mount
Sinai, made holy by God's presence. Now the Lord was ready to
announce His holy law. First He gained their attention by the spec-
tacular display of power. Then in a voice like thunder He proclaimed
His Ten Immortal Words.

   What is the significance for us of the words of reassurance
 with which the Lord began His proclamation (Ex. 20:2)? See
 Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 305.

                                                                    39
Monday                                             January 30
THE FIRST COMMANDMENT (Ex. 20:3).

   Who is the great "I AM" of Exodus 20? Ex. 3:14; John 8:57, 58
(compare 1 Cor. 10:4; The Desire of Ages, p. 307).


    In Exodus 20:1, 2, Yahweh, or Jehovah God, who is Christ Jesus
of the New Testament, is saying in substance: "I delivered you from
Egyptian bondage and so if you trust Me I will likewise deliver you
from the bondage of sin, from the idolatry of violating the first table
of My law and from the inhumanity involved in breaking the second
table. All My biddings are enablings." (See Christ's Object Lessons,
p. 333.)

   What two divine principles summarize the first four com-
mandments and the second six commandments? Matt. 22:34-40
(compare Deut. 6:4-6; Lev. 19:18).


  What is taught by the very first commandment in God's law?
Ex. 20:3; 1 Cor. 8:4.


    "Jehovah, the eternal, self-existent, uncreated One, Himself the
Source and Sustainer of all, is alone entitled to supreme reverence
and worship. Man is forbidden to give to any other object the first
place in his affections or his service. Whatever we cherish that tends
to lessen our love for God or to interfere with the service due Him, of
that do we make a god."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 305.
    The Bible teaches that there is only one true God—the Creator
God. (See Isa. 45:18.) Satan weaned the affections of nearly the
whole world away from the true God and set up his own deities.
Scripture names at least 17 false gods, among whom were Baal-Peor
(Moab, Num. 25:1-3), Dagon (Philistia, 1 Sam. 5:1-3), Ashtoreth and
Milcom (Canaan, 1 Kings 11:5), and Bel (Babylon, Jer. 50:1-3).
    Elijah's contest with the prophets of Baal was a classic demon-
stration of God's power and the impotence of the so-called deities set
up by the evil one. (See 1 Kings 18:17-39.)

    Name at least five objects or gods worshiped in modern
 society. From your own experience, how would you suggest to
 someone who asks the best means of resisting and overcoming
 these modern gods? What god(s) do you need to overcome?

THE SECOND COMMANDMENT (Ex. 20:4-6).

  Note how the second commandment amplifies the first. Ex.
20:4. What reason does God give for obedience to the second
commandment? Ex. 20:5, 6 (compare verses 22-26).


   "The second commandment forbids the worship of the true God
by images or similitudes. Many heathen nations claimed that their
images were mere figures or symbols by which the Deity was wor-
shiped, but God has declared such worship to be sin. The attempt to
represent the Eternal One by material objects would lower man's
conception of God. The mind, turned away from the infinite perfec-
tion of Jehovah, would be attracted to the creature rather than the
Creator. And as his conceptions of God were lowered, so would man
become degraded."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 306.
   The one true God is able to act—to punish those who spurn His
love and to bless those who cherish it. False gods have no such
power.

  Jealousy can be a bad character trait. Yet God is a jealous
God. Explain. Ex. 34:12-15 (compare James 4:4).


   Scripture often represents the relationship between God and His
people as a marriage. An earthly bridegroom genuinely loves his
bride and has no desire to share her intimate affections with anyone
else. Just so God loves His people infinitely and is deeply hurt when
they are untrue to Him. In this sense He is jealous of His people's
affections. (See Jer. 6:2; Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 306.)
   Modern gods are not made of wood and stone, but of film,
printers' ink and paper, metal and wire, buttons and fuses. They may
also be actors and athletes, dictators, and night-club personalities.
Jesus warned against the lust of these things. Things and people can
become our gods: dress, automobiles, houses, lands, admired per-
sons. Humanity is hailed as god. People live and move, talk and cry,
dance and play, murder and rob, commit adultery and behave with
gross indecency on stage and TV screen. And many viewers are
slaves to these idols.

    What deliverance from evil practices occurred at Ephesus?
 Acts 19:18-20. Is idolatry going on in your life and home? How
 can the great I AM—Jesus—save us from these things? (See
1 John 5:18-21; 2:15-17; Heb. 7:25.)


                                                                  41

 REVERENCE AND WORSHIP OF GOD (Ex. 20:7-11).

   What does the third commandment mean? What is involved in
taking the Lord's name "in vain" (Ex. 20:7)? Lev. 19:12; Matt.
5:34-37 (compare Lev. 24:10-16; Isa. 29:23).


   "This commandment not only prohibits false oaths and common
swearing, but it forbids us to use the name of God in a light or
careless manner, without regard to its awful significance."—Patri-
archs and Prophets, p. 306.
   "Holy and reverend is his name" (Ps 111:9). We should call upon
the name of God when we pray, testify, or witness. When we pray we
ask favors of God in Jesus' name. The seraphim, the highest of the
angels, sing with reverent praise, "Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God
Almighty" (Rev. 4:8) and they never tire of joyful praise.

  What does the content of the Sabbath command reveal re-
garding its importance? Ex. 20:8-11. How should the Sabbath be
observed? Isa. 58:12-14. What does our weekly Sabbath observ-
ance signify? Ex. 31:13, 16, 17.


   "The Sabbath is not introduced as a new institution but as having
been founded at creation. It is to be remembered and observed as the
memorial of the Creator's work. Pointing to God as the Maker of the
heavens and the earth, it distinguishes the true God from all false
gods. All who keep the seventh day, signify by this act that they are
worshipers of Jehovah. Thus the Sabbath is the sign of man's alle-
giance to God as long as there are any upon the earth to serve Him.
The fourth commandment is the only one of all the ten in which are
found both the name and the title of the Lawgiver. It is the only one
that shows by whose authority the law is given. Thus it contains the
seal of God, affixed to His law as evidence of its authenticity and
binding force."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 307.
   God has given us six days to work, asking that we refrain from
work on the Sabbath. The Sabbath is a special day of communion
with our Maker. Any interruption of that communion, allowing our
minds to dwell on secular matters is desecration of the Sabbath. Jesus
taught that caring for the sick and other acts of necessity on the
Sabbath are acceptable. (See Mark 2:23-3:6.)

   What blessings have you found in Sabbath observance? What
 has it done for your physical and spiritual life?

  Each of the Ten Commandments implies a positive spiritual
imperative. What is the deep spiritual meaning of the last six
commandments (Ex. 20:12-17)? (See Patriarchs and Prophets,
pp. 308, 309.)


  Commandment 5: "Honor your father and your mother, that your
days may be long in the land which the Lord your God gives you"
(Ex. 20:12, RSV). Compare Mark 7:8-13.

  Commandment 6: "You shall not murder" (Ex. 20:13, NIV).
Compare Matt. 5:21-26.

  Commandment 7: "You shall not commit adultery" (Ex. 20:14,
NIV). Compare Matt. 5:27-30; Rom. 1:24, 25; Eph. 5.3.

   Commandment 8: "You shall not steal" (Ex. 20:15, NIV). Com-
pare Mal. 3:8; Prov. 11:1; 16:8; 21:6; 22:16; Jer. 17:11.

  Commandment 9: "You shall not give false testimony against
your neighbor" (Ex. 20:16, NIV). Compare Ex. 23:1; Prov. 19:9.

   Commandment 10: "You shall not covet your neighbor's house.
You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his manservant or
maidservant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your
neighbor" (Ex. 20:17, NIV). Compare Luke 12:15; Col. 3:5.

  How is it possible for a born-again believer to keep these
moral precepts? Rom. 8:3, 4; John 15:7, 10.


   "Though Christ is said to have fulfilled the law for us, yet it is
nowhere intimated in the Scripture that he has so fulfilled these ten
laws, as to exempt us from the necessity and privilege of being no
idolaters, swearers, Sabbath-breakers, disobedient and cruel chil-
dren, murderers, adulterers, thieves, and corrupt witnesses. . . . It is
therefore readily granted that no man unassisted and uninfluenced by
the grace of Christ can keep these commandments, either in the letter
or in the spirit; but he who is truly converted to God, and has Christ
dwelling in his heart by faith, can, in the letter and in the spirit, do all
these things, because Christ strengthens him."—Adam Clarke, A
Commentary and Critical Notes (New York: Lane and Sandford,
1843), vol. 1, p. 407. Italics in original. (See Eze. 36:24-27.)

Friday                                                February 3
FURTHER STUDY: Study Ex. 34:1, 2, 27-29; Matt. 5:17-20; Rom.
3:31; 7:7; 8:3, 4; James 2:10-12. Read "The Law Given to Israel" and
"Satan's Enmity Against the Law" in Patriarchs and Prophets,
pp. 303-314; 331-342.

   God's character revealed in the Ten Commandments may be sum-
marized in ten words that touch our own experience as Christians: (1)
faith, (2) truth, (3) reverence, (4) obedience, (5) respect, (6) love, (7)
purity, (8) honesty, (9) truthfulness, and (10) contentment.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What 10 words might represent Satan's evil substitute for the
     ten principles stated in the Ten Commandments?

     2. Why did Jesus come to earth to fulfill the Law perfectly? Why
        does He expect us to emulate Him? (See Rev. 3:21; 1 John
        3:4-9; 5:18.)

     3. What means of grace provided in the gospel make loyalty and
        obedience to Christ a reality?

     4. A friend asks how you can reconcile the negative commands
        of the Ten Commandments with the law of love given in the
        Sermon on the Mount. How would you answer?

SUMMARY: "The great principles of God's law are embodied in
the Ten Commandments and exemplified in the life of Christ. They
express God's love, will, and purposes concerning human conduct
and relationships and are binding upon all people in every age.
These precepts are the basis of God's covenant with His people and
the standard in God's judgment. Through the agency of the Holy
Spirit they point out sin and awaken a sense of need for a Saviour.
Salvation is all of grace and not of works, but its fruitage is obedi-
ence to the Commandments. This obedience develops Christian
character and results in a sense of well-being. It is an evidence of
our love for the Lord and our concern for our fellow men. The
obedience of faith demonstrates the power of Christ to transform
lives, and therefore strengthens Christian witness."—Fundamental
Beliefs, no. 18, in Seventh-day Adventists Believe, p. 232.

610b11 Alaska      Sudanese Youth Do "Impossible"
    ‘;51ifiV                 Berhane Woldemariam

           Most of Sudan's 27 million inhabitants are Muslim. Until
        recently, the Adventist church barely had a toehold there. Work
        has been slow among the Sudanese, who are caught up in a war
        that has displaced one out of 15 countrymen.
           During 1993, the Year of Youth Evangelism, leaders of the
        Sudan Field challenged the youth to see what they could do for
        God. "Nobody ever told them it would be difficult," Sudan Field
        president Berhane Woldemariam said. "They just went out and
        did it." And in this difficult field that has only two ordained
        ministers, the youth are showing the rest of us what can be done
        with youthful energy and imagination.
           Young people went out into the streets of Khartoum and
        neighboring towns to hold Voice of Youth meetings. Through
        drama and sermon they attracted crowds of up to 300. They
        collected names of interests and followed up with studies. From
        these meetings young people of South Sudan baptized 95.
           The youth were so encouraged they conducted a second pro-
        gram in another area, and another 40 were baptized. This is in
        one of the most difficult areas in the Middle East Union to win
        converts. Difficult? Impossible? Nobody told the young people.
           Twelve teams of two are stationing themselves around Sudan
        to witness to people seeking for a better way. Each team is
        studying with 20 to 40 people and forming churches.
           The fields of the Middle East Union had set a goal of 150
        baptisms for the youth during the Year of Youth Evangelism.
        During the first half of 1993, the youth registered 287 baptisms.
        Throughout the Middle East, faithful members work quietly
        under adverse conditions to spread the gospel. During 1992, 20
        people were baptized into fellowship in Iraq. We do not hear
        about them because of the sensitive nature of the work there, but
                                               God hasn't forgotten, and
                                               believers around the world
                                               are praying for them.

                                                 Sudanese young people
                                              preach in the streets of
                                              Khartoum.
                                                 Berhane Woldemariam is
                                              president of the Sudan Field.

 The Qualities That Qualify




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matthew 5.

     MEMORY VERSE: "You, therefore, must be perfect, as your
     heavenly Father is perfect" (Matthew 5:48, RSV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Jesus taught that the great qualification for
entrance into the kingdom of heaven is righteousness (Matt. 5:20;
25:46)—righteousness which God gives freely to those who plead
for it (Matt. 5:6). This gift empowers believers to fulfill the spirit of
God's law as Jesus outlined it in the Sermon on the Mount.

   CHRIST'S KINGDOM IS SPIRITUAL. Matthew 5, the first
segment of Jesus' "inaugural address," the Sermon on the Mount,
provides a clear and correct view of the spiritual nature of our Lord's
kingdom. He called it "the kingdom of heaven." The nation Israel,
chosen by Heaven to represent God and His laws to the world, was a
theocracy. Though there was an earthly king, God was the absolute
monarch. God expected the king, elders, and judges to administer His
laws. But all the kings of Israel and most of the kings of Judah broke
the covenant relationship with the Lord. Many severed their connec-
tion with Heaven by becoming idolaters. The monarchical theocracy
came to an end with Zedekiah, the last king of Judah. But God had
promised that the kingdom established by David would not cease.
The Messiah would come and sit upon the throne of David, establish-
ing a spiritual kingdom. Jesus Christ is to govern as King in the lives
of all who accept His principles and choose to follow Him.

THE BLESSED PEOPLE IDENTIFIED (Matt. 5:1-12).

  Describe the circumstances and venue for Jesus' famous dis-
course. Matt. 5:1, 2.


  By the sea, seated on a mountainside, Jesus taught His disciples
and the multitude the spiritual qualities possessed by the subjects of
His kingdom. (See The Desire of Ages, p. 298.)

   Jesus uttered nine blessings (Matt. 5:3-12). After reading the
references given below, how would you describe the people whom
Jesus regards as members of His spiritual kingdom? (See Thoughts
From the Mount of Blessing, pp. 6-35.)


   The "poor in spirit" (Matt 5:3): By contrast with those who
think they are "rich, and increased with goods" (Rev. 3:17), they
sense their total dependence upon Christ.
   "They that mourn" (Matt. 5:4). God comforts those who mourn
the loss of loved ones and those who mourn the sins that crucified the
Son of God. (See Luke 18:13.)
   "The meek" (Matt. 5:5). These are not weak, cowardly, fearful
people, but are as Jesus was, patient, gentle, and humble in the face
of unjust treatment. (See Phil. 2:5-7.)
   "Those who hunger and thirst for righteousness" (Matt. 5:6,
RSV). Recognizing their own unrighteousness, they plead that Christ's
righteousness will be counted for them and bestowed upon them.
(See Rom. 4:5; 8:9, 10.)
   "The merciful" (Matt. 5:7). They show compassion for others
and willingness to forgive those who have wronged them. (See Job
29:12-16; Matt. 18:21, 22.)
   "The pure in heart" (Matt. 5:8). "In one who is learning of
Jesus, there will be manifest a growing distaste for careless manners,
unseemly language, and coarse thought."—Thoughts From the Mount
of Blessing, pp. 24, 25.
   "The peacemakers" (Matt. 5:9). The person at peace with God
(Rom. 5:1) will diffuse a spirit of peace and harmony between hu-
mans and with Christ. (See Micah 5:7; James 3:17, 18.)
   The "persecuted for righteousness' sake" (Matt. 5:10). They
share Christ's sufferings (1 Peter 2:21) and depend solely upon His
sustaining grace (2 Cor. 12:9).
   "When men shall revile you" (Matt. 5:11). They are blessed
because their characters remain steadfast when their reputations are
slandered. (See James 5:10.)

                                                                   47

THE SALT, THE LIGHT, AND THE LAW (Matt. 5:13-26).

   With what two things from nature did the Lord illustrate the
vitality of a Christian's witness? Matt. 5:13-16. How would you
apply Jesus' words to yourself?


    As salt gives savor, or taste, to the food it permeates, so Christians
pervaded by the love of Christ disseminate love and hope to those
around them. "Without a living faith in Christ as a personal Saviour it
is impossible to make our influence felt in a skeptical world."
—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 37. As believers receive
Christ, "the light of the world" (John 8:12), into their hearts, they
impart this light to others.

   Did the coming of Jesus to earth destroy the law or establish
it? How did Jesus fulfill the law? Matt. 5:17-20.


    "I have not come to do away with them [God's laws]" (Matt. 5:17,
Twentieth Century New Testament) or "to annul them" (Weymouth).
    Many New Testament passages emphasize that God's moral law
of Ten Commandments is the standard of righteousness for the Christian
believer. (See Rom. 3:31; 7:7, 12, 14; 8:3, 4; James 2:10-12.) Jesus'
life is the ultimate standard of righteousness because He did as Isaiah
had predicted: "He will magnify the law, and make it honourable"
(Isa. 42:21).
    Our righteousness can exceed the righteousness of the scribes and
Pharisees (Matt. 5:20) only as we allow Christ, by the Holy Spirit, to
write the principles of the law upon our hearts. (See Phil. 1:11; Rom.
10:5-10.)

  How did Jesus magnify the law regarding murder? Matt. 5:21,
22; 1 John 3:11-18.


   "One who becomes a party to the least injustice is breaking the
law, and degrading his own moral nature. Murder first exists in the
mind. He who gives hatred a place in his heart is setting his feet in the
path of the murderer, and his offerings are abhorrent to God."—The
Desire of Ages, p. 310.
   Rather than hating others, we should seek to become reconciled to
them (Matt. 5:23-26).

ABOUT ADULTERY AND DIVORCE (Matt. 5:27-32).

   Explain why Jesus categorized the lustful look as adultery
(Matt. 5:28). Matt. 15:19. How do you understand the striking
figures of speech Jesus used, recorded in Matthew 5:29, 30.


   Sexual impurity is in the mind and the heart before it is put into
action. (See Job 31:1.)
   "Near the close of this earth's history Satan will work with all his
powers in the same manner and with the same temptations wherewith
he tempted ancient Israel just before their entering the land of prom-
ise. He will lay snares for those who claim to keep the command-
ments of God, and who are almost on the borders of the heavenly
Canaan. He will use his powers to their utmost in order to entrap
souls, and to take God's professed people upon their weakest points.
Those who have not brought the lower passions into subjection to the
higher powers of their being, those who have allowed their minds to
flow in a channel of carnal indulgence of the baser passions, Satan is
determined to destroy with his temptations—to pollute their souls
with licentiousness."—Ellen G. White, Testimonies on Sexual Be-
havior, p. 84.

   Explain Jesus' teaching about putting away one's wife. Matt.
5:32.


   "Putting away" was common among the Jews; they could put
away their wives for any reason whatsoever. But Jesus was con-
cerned for women divorced by selfish husbands. He indicated that no
man has a right to put away his wife unless she has been unfaithful to
him. He then declared that the man who marries the divorced woman
commits adultery. A woman who is put away for immorality and
marries another commits adultery. On the other hand, if the husband
or wife has maintained an adulterous relationship and puts away his
or her innocent partner, the innocent one is free to marry again.
Thank God that forgiveness, restoration, and renewal are available
for adulterers.

    Are the teachings of Jesus on divorce and remarriage still
 applicable today? If not, why not? In respect to the divorce of
 certain believers, how can we avoid criticism and a "holier than
 thou" attitude?



                                                                     49
Wednesday                                           February 8
ABOUT OATH TAKING AND VIOLENCE (Matt. 5:33-42).

     What kind of oath taking is unacceptable? Matt. 5:33-37.


   An oath is unnecessary unless, of course, one is called before a
court to give testimony. Then an oath to tell the truth is proper. Jesus
Himself took an oath when He appeared before Caiaphas (Matt.
26:62-67).
   When we were children, we might have reinforced a statement
with some kind of oath. When older, we might say, "I'll swear it's
true on a stack of Bibles." All of this is inappropriate and unneces-
sary. Truth is its own defense and does not need an oath for support.

  Do you find yourself falling back on oath taking to support
your word? If so why?


   "We are all conscious of the value of simplicity in speech, even
though we may not always practice it. When one says, in order to
produce conviction in another, 'I will take my oath that it is so,'
doubt is immediately created in the mind of the one to whom the
thing is said. The taking of an oath always postulates the possibility
of deceit."—G. Campbell Morgan, Great Chapters of the Bible,
p. 123.

  What is better than "an eye for an eye"? Matt. 5:38-42 (com-
pare Deut. 32:35; Rom. 12:19).


   Here actions are described that are better than revenge or retalia-
tion. Some think that of all the teachings of Jesus this quintet of
commands is the hardest to obey. Do you agree or disagree? Why?
   "He who is imbued with the Spirit of Christ abides in Christ. The
blow that is aimed at him falls upon the Saviour, who surrounds him
with His presence. Whatever comes to him comes from Christ. He
has no need to resist evil, for Christ is his defense. Nothing can touch
him except by our Lord's permission, and 'all things' that are permit-
ted 'work together for good to them that love God.' Romans 8:28."
—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 71.

   Why does it seem so difficult to return good for evil? Are we
 happier returning good for evil, or evil for good? Which is
 more satisfying?

Thursday                                          February 9
LOVE THY NEIGHBOR AS THYSELF (Matt. 5:43-48).

   Why should we love our enemies? What are the advantages to
us of loving them? Matt. 5:43-47.


   There was no counsel in Moses' law to "hate" anyone, but in
Deuteronomy 23:6 God forbade the children of Israel to ever seek the
peace or prosperity of the Moabites. Why? Because they had sought
Balaam' s aid in cursing Israel. (Compare Lev. 19:17, 18.)
   The enemies of the church sometimes have interpreted Christian
love, longsuffering, and good will as weakness and cowardice. But
what is Jesus' example?
   1. Love your enemies: The scribes and Pharisees were committed
by envy and clerical pride to murder Jesus, and they poisoned the
minds of the populace against Him. But Jesus loved them still.
   2. Bless them that curse you: Jesus' persecutors and executioners
were the objects of His dying prayer, "Father, forgive them; for they
know not what they do" (Luke 23:34).
   3. Do good to them that hate you: When the Jews again and again
sought to entangle Jesus in His speech and to charge Him falsely with
violating Roman or Jewish law, His penetrating replies, full of wis-
dom and love, exposed their hypocrisy and strikingly revealed His
divinity. He would do them good in spite of their evil designs.
   4. Pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you:
Jesus spent entire nights in prayer for His disciples and for the
leaders of Israel.

   What is the ultimate goal set before us? Matt. 5:48.


   Jesus' concept of perfection involved a relationship with God that
manifests itself in the loving attitudes toward others of which He
spoke in the Sermon on the Mount.
   "The conditions of eternal life, under grace, are just what they
were in Eden—perfect righteousness, harmony with God, perfect
conformity to the principles of His law. The standard of character
presented in the Old Testament is the same that is presented in the
New Testament. This standard is not one to which we cannot attain.
In every command or injunction that God gives there is a promise,
the most positive, underlying the command. God has made provision
that we may become like unto Him, and He will accomplish this for
all who do not interpose a perverse will and thus frustrate His
grace."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 76. (Italics sup-
plied.)

                                                                   51

Friday                                            February 10
FURTHER STUDY: Read Luke 6:19-49; 17:20, 21. Also read "The
Sermon on the Mount," in The Desire of Ages, pp. 298-314. (See the
comments in Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, pp. 6-78.)

 QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION:
  I. Analyze the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7). Is it long or
     short by modern standards? Time your reading of it. For
     whom did Christ intend it? Do you think Christ could be heard
     clearly in an open-air arena? Matt. 5:1, 2. Did He teach or
     preach? Matt. 5:2; 7:29.

     2. Blessed and happy are words equal in meaning. Explain how
        humility, mourning, and persecution can coexist with happi-
        ness.

     3. Does Jesus' discourse magnifying the law of God make you
        feel uncomfortable? Matt. 5:17-44. In what ways? How may
        we relate to His inspired teaching? How is it possible to obey
        Him and enjoy being like Him?

     4. Discuss the command "Be ye therefore perfect" (Matt. 5:48).
        The Greek word translated "perfect" in the KJV may be ren-
        dered "mature." Is sin ever an evidence of maturity? What are
        Jesus' expectations for us?
            "As God is perfect in His sphere, so man may be perfect in
        his sphere."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 64. "He is a perfect and
        holy example, given for us to imitate. We cannot equal the
        pattern, but we shall not be approved of God if we do not copy
        it and, according to the ability which God has given, resemble
        it."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 549.

SUMMARY: The Master Teacher describes the character of the
people who make up His spiritual kingdom. The contrast between
Jesus' kingdom of grace and virtue and the kingdom expectation of
His contemporaries is marked and painful. But the humble, faithful
follower of Jesus is encouraged and challenged, while the devotee of
ritual, form, and ceremony is alarmed and rebellious. Not the clash-
ing of arms and emancipation by force, but the deliverance of the
soul from the mastery of sin, is accomplished by the Lord Jesus
Christ. Even today the Sermon on the Mount creates division be-
tween two types of professed Christian, those who worship God in
spirit and in truth and those "having a form of godliness, but denying
the power thereof" (2 Tim. 3:5). In which group do you find your-
self?

Mabel Missies        Champion Surrenders to Christ
    55FR7                           Syd Kettner

           My name is Eva Martinovska (Martin-OV-skah). I am 18
        years old and live in the city of Most, in the Czech Republic. I
        am a champion runner. I hold the Czech record in the 800-meter
        race and have won that event many times in international com-
        petitions. I was preparing for the Olympics when God changed
        my life. If someone had told me a year ago that sports would not
        be first in my life, I would have laughed.
            I am studying medicine at the university, so when I saw a
        notice about lectures on preventive medicine that were part of
        evangelistic meetings, I decided to attend. During the health
        lectures, the doctor discussed how our bodies function in such
        marvelous ways. I began to realize that life consists in more than
        sports. As he presented Christ as Creator and Healer, I felt a
        yearning to know more about Jesus. I began listening to the
        evangelist with interest. As my understanding of God and His
        claims on my life became clearer to me, I wrestled with conflict-
        ing desires—my love for sports and the call of Jesus in my heart.
            After struggling for weeks, I took a stand for Christ and
        began studying for baptism. I realized then that if I followed
        Christ I would have to give up my competitive sports career,
        because most athletic competitions are on Sabbath. As the bap-
        tism drew near, the tension became unbearable. I asked God for
        courage to make the right decision. My coach did not under-
        stand my dilemma, and even my family seemed unable to help
        me. Finally, following a difficult spiritual struggle, I was bap-
        tized in March 1993.
            God has given me wonderful peace. Without His help, and
         the understanding of my new Christian friends, I could not have
         made this difficult decision. I thank God for His guidance and
         for the wonderful people I have met since becoming an Adventist.

       The Keynote of Victory




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Peter 1:1-21.

     MEMORY TEXT: "His divine power hath given unto us all
     things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowl-
     edge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue" (2 Peter
     1:3).


   KEY THOUGHT: Knowing Christ means receiving His divine
power for deliverance from evil passions and for constant spiritual
growth in preparation for His glorious second advent.

    CHRIST IS OUR ROCK OF SUPPORT. A group of student
singers were on board a ship that caught fire. One young man fixed a
life-belt to his wife and another to himself, but in the scuffle to
abandon ship someone took his wife's life-belt. After jumping over-
board she found herself helpless in the water. She clung to her
husband's shoulders as long as she could, but her strength began to
wane. "I can't hold on any longer," she cried. "Try a little longer,"
was his entreaty. And then he added, "Let us sing 'Rock of Ages.' "
   They both began to sing faintly, and others around them, strug-
gling to stay afloat, joined in the song. Strength seemed to come with
the song. They were able to hold out until a boat arrived and lifted
them on board.
   The message of 2 Peter 1 is this: Through the undergirding power
of Christ, we resist the impact of the swirling confusion and impurity
around us. By this means we can hold on till our Lord returns and
transports us to eternal safety.

ABUNDANT GRACE FOR CHRISTIANS (2 Peter 1:1-4).

  To whom does Peter direct his second Epistle? What do the
writer and the believer have in common? 2 Peter 1:1.


   "To those who have received a faith as precious as ours through
the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ" (2 Peter 1:1,
NRSV). Christ imparts the faith that lays hold upon His righteous-
ness. Then Christ Himself, our God and Saviour, becomes our ever-
present righteousness. There is a commonality of experience in re-
ceiving Christ's gift of righteousness by faith. Peter enjoyed this gift,
and so did the people to whom he wrote both his Epistles (2 Peter
3:1)—the believers of Asia Minor (1 Peter 1:1).

   What special gifts did Christ impart to the believers as they
came to know Him? What are the results when His promises are
received and believed? 2 Peter 1:2-4.


   "The word here used for 'knowledge' (epignosis) is more em-
phatic than the simple noun form (gnosis), and implies a fuller, more
perfect knowledge that comes from contemplation of the object stud-
ied. Such knowledge cannot fail to influence the life of the one who
gains it. When it centers on the Father and the Son it brings abundant
grace and peace into the heart of its possessor. The apostle is very
much aware of the efficacy of this epignosis, and refers to it four
times in his epistle (here; vs. 3, 8; ch. 2:20)."—SDA Bible Commen-
tary, vol. 7, p. 596.
   When God's grace is multiplied to us, it consists of the divine
power that provides us "all things that pertain to life and godliness"
(2 Peter 1:3, RSV). Paul thanked God for the grace given to the
Corinthians by which they were "enriched in every way—in all . . .
speaking and in all . . . knowledge" (1 Cor. 1:5, NIV; compare 1 Cor.
15:10; 2 Cor. 8:9; 9:8; 12:9).
   God's promises are acts of grace. By accepting these promises by
faith we "escape from the corruption that is in the world because of
passion, and become partakers of the divine nature" (2 Peter 1:4,
RSV). The divine nature pervades our lives, and we have the power
to resist corruption and overcome the temptation to evil.

    Can you testify to the power of Christ in delivering you from
 the power of sin? How has your knowledge of, and faith in, the
 Word of God contributed to that victory?


                                                                       55

GROWING IN GRACE (2 Peter 1:5-11).

  What qualities does Peter urge us to make every effort to
develop by faith in Christ? 2 Peter 1:5-7.


   Peter is not suggesting that we develop these qualities in chrono-
logical sequence, working on a new virtue when we have sufficiently
mastered the previous one. If we did that, love would come last.
   "You are not to think that you must wait until you have perfected
one grace before cultivating another. No; they are to grow up to-
gether, fed continually from the fountain of charity [love]; every day
that you live, you can be perfecting the blessed attributes fully
revealed in the character of Christ; and when you do this, you will
bring light, love, peace, and joy into your homes."—Ellen G. White
Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 943.
   When we receive Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour, we receive all
of Him, all of His virtues—not one at a time. The eight virtues
mentioned by Peter are resident in Jesus. But these gemstones of
character, which become ours when we receive Him as Lord and
Saviour, are polished by experience and testing. Each day lived in
relationship with Christ adds luster to these gemstones. Faith grows
stronger, knowledge increases, patience develops, brotherly love and
charity blossom to the full.

   How is the person described who lacks these eight virtues?
2 Peter 1:8, 9. How can we make our "calling and election sure"?
Verse 10, KJV. What precious promises are given us? Verses 10,
11.


   We have the assurance of present salvation in Christ as, by faith,
we experience fellowship with Him and allow His grace to foster the
spiritual virtues that Peter has mentioned. If we neglect daily dedica-
tion to and communion with Christ, we will be spiritually "ineffec-
tive or unfruitful" (2 Peter 1:8, RSV), and will fall back into our old
sins (verse 9). The vigilant Christian enjoys the, gift of eternal life
(1 John 5:11-13) and has the assurance of "an entrance into the
eternal kingdom" (2 Peter 1:11, RSV).

    Peter counsels us to "be the more zealous to confirm your
 call and election" (2 Peter 1:10, RSV). The statement implies
 personal effort. How can you reconcile this counsel with the
 truth that salvation is only by faith?

STIRRING UP THE MEMORY (2 Peter 1:12-15).

   Why does Peter not hesitate to remind his readers of things
they already know? 2 Peter 1:12, 13, 15 (compare Luke 22:32;
John 21:15-17).


    As a faithful shepherd of the flock, Peter knew that all believers
need to be constantly reminded of the gospel truth they already
know. C. S. Lewis wrote, "Christ did not come to preach any brand
new morality. The Golden Rule of the New Testament (Do as you
would be done by) is a summing up of what every one, at bottom, had
always known to be right. . . . The real job of every moral teacher is
to keep on bringing us back, time after time, to the old simple
principles which we are all so anxious not to see."—Mere Christian-
ity (London: Collins, 1958), p. 74.

   What is the significance of the expression "the present truth"
(2 Peter 1:12)?


   "The truth that has already reached you" (NEB); "the truth that
[you] now [hold]" (Amplified); "the truth that has come to you"
(NRSV). Present truth for the early Christians included all Bible
truth, most prominent of which was the passion of Christ, including
the glorious doctrine of the resurrection. Christ announced it (John
2:19-22), and the apostles proclaimed it (Acts 2:23, 32).
   Present truth today includes all of the above with emphasis on the
Second Advent prophecies that were not unsealed until the "time of
the end" (Dan. 12:9), and the messages of the pre-Advent judgment
and the Sabbath that for centuries had not been clearly understood
(Rev. 14:6-12).

   What is the significance of the fact that Peter expected his life
to end in the near future? 2 Peter 1:14; John 21:18-23.


   Peter did not expect to live on until the second advent of Christ,
and John did not rule out the possibility of his death before that
event. In its context, 2 Peter 1:14 underlines Peter's great concern to
remind the believers of the truths they had accepted. Because his
death was imminent, he wanted to provide the church with written
testimony that would speak until Jesus comes.



                                                                    57
Wednesday                                        February 15
PETER RECALLS AN EYEWITNESS EXPERIENCE (2 Peter
1:16-18).

   Why did Peter make reference to a particularly dramatic
event in Jesus' life? 2 Peter 1:16-18; Matt. 17:1-8.


   The word "For" introducing 2 Peter 1:16 links what follows with
what has gone before. There are compelling reasons why the be-
lievers should be reminded of Christ's power to enable them to grow
spiritually. One very good reason is that God demonstrated the deity
of Christ to Peter, James, and John in the miraculous transfiguration
experience. Peter resorts to the testimony of the senses—sight and
hearing—as another strong argument in favor of Jesus' messiahship,
His divinity. The great truth of Christ's resurrection power was no
cunningly devised myth. Believers in every age can have confidence
that what the apostles saw and heard is convincing evidence.

   How do we know that the transfiguration of Christ was a pre-
enactment of His glorification at the Second Coming? 2 Peter
1:16, 17 (compare Mark 9:1 with verses 2-8; compare Luke 9:27
with verses 28-36).


   "Moses upon the mount of transfiguration was a witness to Christ's
victory over sin and death. He represented those who shall come
forth from the grave at the resurrection of the just. Elijah, who had
been translated to heaven without seeing death, represented those
who will be living upon the earth at Christ's second coming, and who
will be 'changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last
trump'; when 'this mortal must put on immortality,' and 'this cor-
ruptible must put on incorruption.' 1 Cor. 15:51-53. Jesus was clothed
with the light of heaven, as He will appear when He shall come 'the
second time without sin unto salvation.' For He will come 'in the
glory of his Father with the holy angels.' Heb. 9:28; Mark 8:38. The
Saviour's promise to the disciples was now fulfilled. Upon the mount
the future kingdom of glory was represented in miniature—Christ the
King, Moses a representative of the risen saints, and Elijah of the
translated ones."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 421, 422.

   Peter lived and worked with Christ and witnessed His trans-
figuration. We have not had those experiences. Why, then,
should we accept Peter's experience as evidence of the deity of
Christ and of His second coming?

Thursday                                         February 16
THE CERTAINTY OF THE PROPHETIC WORD (2 Peter 1:19-
21).

   What testimony of God could be more powerful than the
transfiguration of Christ, which Peter witnessed? 2 Peter 1:18,
19.


   "And we have the prophetic word made more sure" (2 Peter 1:19,
RSV). "And we have the word of the prophets made more certain"
(NIV). The apostles had the witness of their own senses; they knew
Christ personally and received repeated evidence of His messiahship.
But the manner in which His life, death, and resurrection fulfilled the
Old Testament prophecies was equally convincing, and to Peter's
readers even more convincing. In their witnessing for Christ, the
apostles constantly applied Old Testament prophecies to Him. (See
Acts 2:22-36; 3:18; 4:10, 11, 23-28.)
   To us today, Bible prophecy is compelling evidence of the deity of
Christ and of the great significance of His atoning sacrifice and
resurrection from the dead. But fulfilled prophecy also increases our
confidence in the forecasts of the future given by Jesus (Matthew
24), Daniel, John, and other prophets. The fact that Daniel accurately
foretold the sweep of human history from his day to ours (Dan. 2:14-
45) gives us confidence that his predictions of events future to our
day will certainly be fulfilled.

  In the interpretation of scriptural prophecy, what must we
avoid? 2 Peter 1:20. How were the prophets guided in their
spoken utterances? Verse 21. What is the implication for the
manner in which we interpret the prophecies?


   Jesus taught that the same Holy Spirit who inspired the prophecies
in the first place is available to the humble, teachable student who
prayerfully seeks an understanding of the Bible's prophetic mes-
sages. "When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all
truth" (John 16:13, RSV). Because the Holy Spirit gave the prophetic
messages (2 Tim. 3:16, 17), it stands to reason that no interpretation
is valid but that which results from the teaching ministry of the Holy
Spirit.

   How can you be sure that the Holy Spirit is guiding your
 mind as you study Bible prophecy? On what basis can you test
 someone else's interpretation?


                                                                     59
Friday                                              February 17
FURTHER STUDY: On the subject of preparation to meet the Lord,
study Romans 13:11-14; Titus 2:11-15; 3:3-8. Compare these pas-
sages with 2 Peter 1:3, 4, 10, 11. These scriptures urge the saints to
escape the world's moral and spiritual corruption. Purity of heart and
life is the hallmark of God's holy ones whom He will take off this
planet to their heavenly abode. Read "Apostasy at the Jordan" in
Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 453-461.

   Christian virtue versus false teaching: In 2 Peter the apostle is
concerned about false teachings that can be met only by believers
strong in Christian character. Hence in chapter 1 he urges Christian
growth and grace as the best method of counteracting false teaching.
John makes plain in 2 John 1-12 that to obey God and to abide in the
doctrine of Christ is to escape the influence of false teachers. Abid-
ing in Christ is the most effective preventive of heresy.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. A friend asks you how we can have the assurance of salvation.
     How would you use this week's lesson to help you answer the
    question?

     2. You hear a professing Christian say, "Christ has done every-
        thing for me; there is nothing for me to do but accept His offer
        of salvation." In the light of 2 Peter 1:5-8, do you believe that
        statement? How would you explain to this person the role of
        the believer in the sanctification process, without contradict-
        ing Paul's teaching of salvation by faith? (See Gal. 2:16.)

     3. If you could have been with Jesus during one event in His life,
        which event would that have been? Why?

     4. If someone asked you to prove that the Scriptures are God's
        word, how would you answer? How does your answer relate to
        your Bible-study habits? Your witness?

SUMMARY: In chapter one Peter states the basic ideas, the ruling
principles in the Christian life. He shows that an acquaintance with
Jesus makes possible a life of godliness. Peter wishes to assure those
who read his two letters that he had, indeed, been an eyewitness of
the glory of Christ on the Mount of Transfiguration. He affirms that
the writings of the prophets are inspired and that they are more
dependable than sight or sound.

                     Pentecost in China
                           Eugene Hsu

   Just one year after 2,000 believers were baptized in a city in
northeast China, another baptism was held. This time, more than
4,400 were baptized in a four-day baptismal marathon.
   Following the 1992 baptism, government officials and police
harassed the church and its members. Police were posted inside
and outside the church to prevent further baptisms and Com-
munion services. But this did not frighten the church members,
who continued their worship services with their visitors present.
   When the government received word of plans for a second
baptism scheduled for August 1993, officials insisted that an
authorized Three-Self Movement pastor perform the baptism.
Church members understood that this was a delay tactic and
they again decided to conduct the baptism without government
recognition.
   Baptismal candidates were carefully prepared and had to take
a written exam on Bible doctrines. Those who passed the exam
were given a numbered entrance card and told to arrive at the
baptismal site at 6:00 a.m. At the appointed time, candidates
lined up in groups for baptism according to their numbers. The
aging local elders in the church did not have sufficient strength
to physically baptize the people, so church members assisted. As
the elders spoke the baptismal vows, the deacons and deacon-
esses quickly lowered the candidates into the water and raised
them again.
   Around 8:00 a.m., government officials arrived to stop the
baptism. They found a huge crowd, quiet and well organized.
After watching for several minutes, the officials allowed the
baptism to continue.
                              The baptism continued for four days,
                           until 4,415 new believers had been bap-
                           tized! Truly Pentecost is happening in
                           China!
                              With no financial assistance from
                           outside the country, and no trained evan-
                           gelists, this harvest has been the work
                           of the Holy Spirit.

                             Eugene Hsu is secretary of the Eastern
                          Asia Committee at the General Conference.
                          The exact location of the church has been
                          omitted due to threats of persecution.

  Christ's Last Prayer With
        His Disciples




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: John 16:28-33; 17:1-26; Ps.
133:1-3.

     MEMORY TEXT: "That they all may be one; as thou, Father,
     art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that
     the world may believe that thou hast sent me" (John 17:21).


   KEY THOUGHT: Jesus prayed that His disciples would be so
spiritually united to God and to one another that the world would be
drawn to Him and prepared for His ultimate glorification at the
Second Advent.

   JESUS PRAYED FOR US. The apostle John records Jesus' last
prayer offered in the presence of His disciples. Looming before Jesus
is Gethsemane, His capture, and trial, all of which hovers over Him
like a dark cloud. He longs to be glorified that the light of God's
providence might illuminate the forthcoming darkness of His cruci-
fixion. He appeals to His Father, with whom He enjoys perfect union
and unbroken communication, to grant to His closest followers a
union with the Father similar to His own. He prays that His disciples
may be kept from the evil of this present world and that, as a result of
their witnessing, multitudes may be added to His kingdom.
   "Read John 17 over and over again. That prayer of our Saviour
offered to His Father in behalf of His disciples, is worthy to be oft
repeated, and carried in the practical life."—Sons and Daughters of
God, p. 295.

THE SETTING FOR JESUS' PRAYER (John 16:28-33; 17:1).

  How did Jesus seek to strengthen the disciples' faith in His
messiahship? John 16:28-33.


   The Saviour and His disciples had spent Thursday evening to-
gether celebrating the Passover meal in the upper room (John 13). He
had instituted the ordinance of feet-washing and the Lord's Supper
(Matt. 26:20-29). Possessed of an earnest desire that they would
endure the dark days ahead, and knowing that His remaining time on
earth was brief, He gave them the instruction recorded in John 14-
16. Then He prayed for them the prayer of intercession recorded in
John 17.
   "This prayer is a lesson regarding the intercession that the Saviour
would carry on within the veil, when His great sacrifice in behalf of
men, the offering of Himself, should have been completed. Our
Mediator gave His disciples this illustration of His ministration in the
heavenly sanctuary in behalf of all who will come to Him in meek-
ness and humility, emptied of all selfishness, and believing in His
power to save."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commen-
tary, vol. 5, p. 1145.

   What did Jesus mean by His request of the Father that He
might be glorified? Had He not been glorified before? When did
this glorification of Christ take place? Was it before or after His
ascent to the heavenly abode? How is He being glorified now?
John 17:1, 4, 5, 10, 22 (compare John 12:23, 28).


   Notice that Jesus' work on earth glorified the Father (John 17:4).
Christ was about to perform His greatest work on earth—His bearing
the punishment for the sins of the entire world. (See 1 John 2:2.) The
cross was the greatest evidence of the glory of God's character. After
that Christ was glorified in heaven by being reinstated to the immedi-
ate presence of the Father (John 17:5).
   Then "He declares Himself glorified in those who believe on Him.
The church, in His name, is to carry to glorious perfection the work
which He has commenced; and when that church shall be finally
ransomed in the Paradise of God, He will look upon the travail of His
soul and be satisfied. Through all eternity the ransomed host will be
His chief glory."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commen-
tary, vol. 5, p. 1146.



                                                                     63

RELIANCE UPON THE FATHER (John 17:2-12, 22-24).

  How did Jesus Christ, the Lifegiver, affirm the power com-
mitted to Him by His Father? John 17:2 (compare Matt. 28:18-
20).


     What is essential to the reception of eternal life? John 17:3.


    To know Christ as Saviour is much more than knowing about
Him. Intellectual knowledge of the facts of Christianity—the life,
death, resurrection, and heavenly ministry of Christ—is valuable, but
this knowledge alone will save no one. Jesus made clear that be-
lievers have the gift of eternal life (John 5:24). This is because
believers have Christ and the Father living in their hearts by the
presence of the Holy Spirit (John 14:23).
   "These words [John 17:3] mean much. It is only by knowing
Christ that we can know God. The Sent of God calls upon all to listen
to these words. They are the words of God, and all should give heed
to them; for by them they will be judged. To know Christ ravingly is
to be vitalized by spiritual knowledge, to practice His words. With-
out this, all else is valueless."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 5, pp. 1145, 1146.

   Jesus confessed His total reliance upon His Father. Here was
the source of His power. How are the same divine resources open
to us? John 17:4-12, 22-24 (compare John 8:23-29, 42, 54, 55).


   God gave Jesus (1) "power over all flesh" (John 17:2); (2) a
special work on earth (verse 4); (3) His disciples as witnesses (verses
6, 9, 11, 12); (4) words to speak (verse 8), and (5) His glory to reveal
(verses 22, 24).
   As Jesus fulfilled the earthly ministry assigned to Him by His
Father, so in these last days God's remnant people will finish the
gospel work assigned to them. (See Rom. 9:27, 28; Matt. 28:18-20;
24:14.) The Lord Himself will cut short by miraculous intervention
the work of sharing the three angels' messages with the whole world
(Rev. 14:6-12).

  What steps are the members of your church taking to co-
operate with God in answering Jesus' prayer?

SPECIFIC REQUESTS IN JESUS' PRAYER (John 17:9, 11, 13,
15, 20, 24).

  What were Jesus' specific requests for His disciples? John
17:9, 11, 13, 15.


   As they heard His earnest petition, the disciples were greatly
encouraged to know that their Lord and Master had prayed for them.
Think of Peter's experience. Did not Jesus pray for him (Luke 22:31,
32)? Stop and think; Christ has taken your name upon His lips. In His
intercessory work in heaven He has asked the Father to bless you. He
has actually mentioned you by name!
   Jesus has power over all flesh (John 17:2), that is, power and
authority over the whole creation. It is also true that He has power
over men and women who battle with sin (Rom. 8:1-5, 9-13). He can
"save . . . to the uttermost" all "that come unto God by him" (Heb.
7:25).
   "Every soul is as fully known to Jesus as if he were the only one
for whom the Saviour died. The distress of every one touches His
heart. The cry for aid reaches His ear. He came to draw all men unto
Himself."—The Desire of Ages, p. 480.

   What was Jesus' prayer for the ultimate destiny of the con-
verts won by His disciples? John 17:20, 24.


    A man arose in one of Dwight L. Moody's meetings and said, " 'I
have lived on the Mount of Transfiguration for five years.' How
many souls have you led to Christ?' was Mr. Moody's reply. 'I do
not really know,' replied the gentleman. 'Have you led any?' Mr.
Moody again asked. 'I do not know that I have.' Sit down, then,'
said Mr. Moody, 'for we do not want that kind of mountain-top
experience in our church.' "—G. B. F. Hallock, 2,500 Best Modern
Illustrations (New York: Harper & Brothers, 1935), p. 342.
    "0, how the divine Head longed to have His church with Him!
They had fellowship with Him in His suffering and humiliation, and
it is His highest joy to have them with Him to be partakers of His
glory. . . . To have them with Him is according to covenant promise
and agreement with His Father."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1148.

   Jesus' prayer can be our daily petition—that we and our
 families be kept from evil.

ONENESS WITH GOD AND ONE ANOTHER (John 17:14-23).

   What is the meaning of the request "That they all may be one;
as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one
in us"? John 17:21-23.


   Christ in the Father and the Father in Christ is the model for the
Christian—Christ in us and we in Christ. As the Father's will was
embedded and implanted in the mind and heart of Jesus and fulfilled
in His activities, so Christ was in the heart of His Father—loved,
honored, and cherished. This oneness of thought, will, purpose, ac-
tivity, and affection presents a picture of order and unity for all to
behold. God is in Christ and His earthly children. All are involved in
this family embrace, united in one life and purpose by prayer and
divine attachment.

   What does oneness with God do for our individuality? 1 Cor.
15:10; 2 Cor. 12:10.


    Are we to be so absorbed with faith in God and with God's
involvement with us that we cease to function normally? Should the
native personality with which God has endowed us cease to manifest
itself? No! The individual Christian's personality becomes the active
video screen upon which the vital life and righteousness of God is
portrayed.
   "Let us always remember . . . that no matter how great and good a
work the human agent may do, he does not gain the ownership of
those who through his instrumentality have been converted to the
truth. . . . In our ministry we are to bring souls direct to Christ. They
are Christ's property, and must ever be amenable to Him alone.
Every person possesses an individuality that no other person can
claim." —Evangelism, p. 331.
   "Although possessing different temperaments and dispositions,
they [God's people] will see eye to eye in all matters of religious
belief. They will speak the same things, they will have the same
judgment, they will be one in Christ Jesus."—Ellen G. White in
Historical Sketches of the Foreign Missions of the Seventh-day Adventist
Church (Basle, Switzerland: Imprimerie Polyglotte, 1886), p. 124.

   On the basis of John 17:17 how would you evaluate the
 ecumenical call for unity of the churches? Is doctrinal unity
 important?

THE FATHER'S NAME DECLARED BY JESUS (John 17:4-8,
12, 26.

  By what means did Jesus reveal the Father to His disciples?
John 17:6, 12, 26 (compare Ps. 8:1; 22:22).


   God's name is a symbol of His character. To a world that mis-
understands God, Jesus portrays His Father's character (John 14:8-
11). In Christ's ministry and sacrifice are seen the infinite wisdom,
love, justice, and mercy of God. Knowing Jesus, which is knowing
the Father, both informs and transforms. (See 2 Cor. 3:18.)

  By what divine instrument does God sanctify His people?
John 17:14-20.


   The Bible is the standard by which to test the claims of all who
profess sanctification. But the Bible must be interpreted by the Holy
Spirit. We may understand the major teachings of the Word, and we
may employ them to judge others, while, at the same time failing to
submit ourselves to the teaching ministry of the Holy Spirit. Unless
we enjoy the blessings of Spirit-filled holiness and the resulting
conformity to the principles of God's Word, we are in no way
qualified to pass judgment on other beliefs. We must be sanctified by
God's Word (John 16:13; 17:14, 17).

   Why did Christ "sanctify"(KJV) or "consecrate" (RSV) Him-
self? John 17:19. What commission did Jesus give His disciples?
Verses 18, 20. With what results? Acts 2:1-4, 41-47; 1 Thess. 1:5-
8; Col. 1:28.


   As the gospel was preached to the world in that first century, so in
these final times God's message will go to all humanity. How are you
involved in this general proclamation?

  What was the final request Jesus made of the Father? John
17:24-26.


   Do you long to have a part in that celestial celebration? Have
 you entered into an experience with Him that you can trans-
 port to heaven in that great day?

                                                                    67
Friday                                             February 24
FURTHER STUDY: Compare Jesus' last prayer in John 17 with the
prayers of Nehemiah (Neh. 1:5-11; 2:4), Ezra (Ezra 9:5-15), Daniel
(Dan. 9:3-23), Hannah (1 Sam. 1:27-2:10), and Jabez (1 Chron. 4:9,
10). As you read these prayers, what similarities do you find? What
differences?

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Jesus' prayer was audible to His disciples. How would you
     have reacted if you had been present to hear Jesus utter this
     prayer?

     2. How can we actually achieve the "oneness experience" called
        for in Jesus' petition?

     3. Jesus prayed that we might be kept from the evils of this world.
         Ask yourself, "How well am I doing?" Name some of the
         hindrances in the way. "Do I trust God enough? Have I forgot-
         ten that I have the power of will, which I may place on God's
        side in the battle? (See Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 511-513.) Do I
         have a quiet time every day with Jesus?" (Read Matt. 4:1-11
         and I John 2:15-17.)

SUMMARY: In this model prayer, Jesus prayed for all of us, not
only for His disciples. Now as our High Priest in heaven, He makes
intercession for us with the Father. Oneness with Him and with one
another is the high purpose envisioned in this remarkable interces-
sory prayer. Like His disciples, we are sent to reveal the glory and
power of the Father and the Son. But we can do this only as we know
God by personal experience. In heaven at last we shall behold in
glory the Son of God, enthroned and worshiped by the angels and
redeemed alike.

         The Man Whose Name Was Changed
                          Ken Flemmer

    One of ADRA's relief programs distributes 6,000 tons of
corn each year in Eastern Mozambique. The corn is enough to
provide each of 140,000 people with one pound of corn a day.
    Civil war makes work in Mozambique difficult and danger-
ous. Gunfire and land mines threaten even the simplest relief
operations. The first time we went to one village to distribute
food, we hit a small land mine and blew a tire off the truck.
    When local workers were unloading ADRA's first shipment
of relief food, they noticed a man carrying a stick, keeping
people back while the crew carried sacks of corn to the waiting
trucks. Even the children had to wait until the barge was un-
loaded before this "policeman" allowed them to gather the ker-
nels that had fallen.
    An ADRA worker learned that this "policeman" was known
as "Manual the Thief." Villagers said he beat his wife and
neglected his family responsibilities; some said he had killed
some people.
    When the next shipment arrived, Manual was again there
with his stick, to keep law and order. Suddenly the director
looked up and saw Manual with a bag of corn on his head,
walking from the dock. The director expected Manual to disap-
pear into the crowd with the bag of corn, but he walked to the
loading area and dumped his bag onto the truck.
    The director decided to offer Manual a job. Word of Manual's
"promotion" spread through the village. Wasn't Manual known
to be a thief, a violent person, perhaps even a murderer?
    Later, Manual's father came to ADRA's office and asked
 what we had done to Manual. "He is different. He quit drinking,
 he doesn't beat his family, he supports them, and he no longer
 steals," the father exclaimed.
    Manual has changed; now workers in the warehouse refer to
                         him as "Manual our friend." Even though
                         his job is only carrying bags of corn from
                         here to there, it helped him to see how he
                         fit into a bigger plan, and it gave him a
                         reason to live and to change his ways.

      The True Fast, the True
          Restorers, and
        the True Sabbath



Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Isaiah 58.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to
     loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and
     to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?"
     (Isaiah 58:6).

   KEY THOUGHT: Professed piety, religious ritual, and self-
denial are meaningless unless motivated by, and associated with,
loving service for others. Righteousness that is worth anything in-
volves acts of mercy, generosity, and relief for those less fortunate.

   ISAIAH 58 OUTLINES THE BEST METHOD OF WITNESS-
ING FOR CHRIST. This chapter contrasts true and false religion.
The people of Israel, like many churches today, were preoccupied
with ritual, fasting, and ceremony. They wanted to attract the atten-
tion and favor of God. Instead, the Lord gave His stern rebuke, "Cry
aloud, spare not . . . declare to my people their transgression" (verse
1, RSV). The prophet points out a true fast, chosen by God—heart
change and compassion for the poor. There must be a new and
spiritual view of Sabbathkeeping. God would bless Israel if they
would exchange the façade of piety for heartfelt and unselfish out-
reach to the sick, the poor, and the helpless. The message is for
Seventh-day Adventists today, not simply for the Israelites of old.
   "The work that . . . [Adventists] are to do is outlined in the fifty-
eighth chapter of Isaiah. Who is doing this work?"—Ellen G. White,
Review and Herald, Dec. 17, 1901.

ISRAEL'S PAINFUL ILLS (Isa. 58:1).

  Why did the Israel of Isaiah's time need to be shown their true
condition? Isa. 58:1; 56:10; 59:2-8. How about the latter-day
church of Laodicea? Rev. 3:14-17.


   The chosen people's pious profession of external religion left
them powerless to govern human passion and selfishness; hence the
outbreak of carnality in gross form (Isa. 1:4-6). This historical fact
accents the existence of the greatest error ever; namely, that a form of
religion will suffice to gain heaven and God's favor.
   "There are those who profess to serve God, while they rely upon
their own efforts to obey His law, to form a right character, and
secure salvation. Their hearts are not moved by any deep sense of the
love of Christ, but they seek to perform the duties of the Christian life
as that which God requires of them in order to gain heaven. Such
religion is worth nothing. When Christ dwells in the heart, the soul
will be so filled with His love, with the joy of communion with Him,
that it will cleave to Him; and in the contemplation of Him, self will
be forgotten. Love to Christ will be the spring of action."—Steps to
Christ, pp. 44, 45. (Compare Matt. 23:25-28.)

   What brand of religion will be practiced in the last days?
2 Timothy 3:5 (compare Titus 1:16; Isa. 29:13).


   Religious profession without spiritual power manifests itself in a
number of ways. There may be great enthusiasm, considerable noise,
and much public display, but a decided lack of the Holy Spirit's
presence. While religion of this kind may engender warm feelings
and stimulated emotions, it tends to be self-focused. Sacrificial serv-
ice for others is often ignored. On the other hand, formal religious
exercises that insist on traditional modes of expression may involve
meaningful liturgy, beautiful music, and matchless homiletics but be
totally barren of genuine spiritual motivation. Worshipers are regaled
with culturally acceptable art forms and left totally unconcerned
about their suffering neighbors.

    Without attempting to judge others, ask yourself to what
 extent Isaiah's counsel applies to you?




                                                                       71

SOUL AFFLICTION AND FASTING (Isa. 58:2-5).

   What was the Lord's concern regarding His people? Isa. 58:2.
What complaint comes forth from the lips of the Lord's people?
Isa. 58:3.


   Self-righteous people cannot diagnose their real problem. Notice
that Isaiah 58:2 and 3 depict God as viewing the people one way, and
the people viewing themselves quite differently. The people were
afflicted by the spiritual malady that Paul describes as prevalent in
his day: "Israel who pursued the righteousness which is based on law
did not succeed in fulfilling that law. Why? Because they did not
pursue it through faith, but as if it were based on works" (Rom. 9:31,
32, RSV).

   Why were the people's fasts and other religious observances
unacceptable? What rebuke comes forth from God's lips? Isa.
58:3(last part)-5. How does the Lord indicate His disapproval of
the fast of the Israelites?


   Spiritual inconsistency alienates us from the Lord and His bless-
ings. Prostrating ourselves before the Lord while cherishing bitter,
resentful feelings toward others produces no beneficial spiritual re-
sults. Appearing to our fellow believers as sanctified, dedicated Chris-
tians when, in fact, we would like "to quarrel and to fight" (Isa. 58:4,
RSV) is to invite God's displeasure.
   Jesus addressed this very problem: "And when you fast, do not
look dismal, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that
their fasting may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have their
reward. But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, that
your fasting may not be seen by men but by your Father who is in
secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you" (Matt.
6:16-18, RSV).

  Is there a place for fasting in the Christian pattern of service
and worship? Matt. 17:14-21.


   While fasting cannot, and is not intended to, earn credit with God,
it may, over a limited period of time, clear the mind and provide
opportunity for the soul to reach out for God's blessing upon the sick
and the needy.

THE TRUE FAST (Isa. 58:6-11).

   What are the characteristics of a true fast as the Lord outlined
them? Isa. 58:6, 7, 9 (second part), 10.


   The Jews' fast was a religious act. It satisfied the demands of their
self-deception—their idea of acceptance with God, but it was self-
centered. T. S. Eliot wrote, "Nothing dies harder than the desire to
think [too] well of oneself." The people's fasts were designed to
attract attention and admiration.
    Sin has these characteristics: (1) self-sufficiency in place of faith,
(2) self-will in place of submission, (3) self-righteousness in place of
humility.
    The true fast involves a ministry that emulates the healing minis-
try of Jesus. It includes the healing of the sick and the relief of the
needy. But its primary focus is "to loose the bonds of wickedness"
(Isa. 58:6, RSV). Jesus healed the sick to save them from sin. If our
fasting is motivated by our burden for souls, by the all-consuming
desire for lost ones to be released from their bondage, it is the kind of
fasting the Lord approves.

   List the Lord's promises to those who practice the true fast.
Isa. 58:8, 9 (first part), 10 (second part), 11.


   "And your healing shall spring up speedily" (Isa. 58:8, RSV).
What blessings there are for those who engage in medical missionary
work for the primary purpose of leading souls to Christ! "The Holy
Spirit never has, and never will in the future, divorce the medical
missionary work from the gospel ministry. They can not be di-
vorced."—Ellen G. White, Series "B," no. 7, p. 64.
   What blessings there are for those who, though lacking the skill to
minister to the sick, do all they can to encourage others and relieve
their emotional and spiritual pain! "Many are in obscurity. They have
lost their bearings. They know not what course to pursue. Let the
perplexed ones search out others who are in perplexity, and speak to
them words of hope and encouragement. When they begin to do this
work, the light of heaven will reveal to them the path that they should
follow. By their words of consolation to the afflicted they themselves
will be consoled. By helping others, they themselves will be helped
out of their difficulties."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 4, p. 1151.



                                                                        73

BUILDERS AND REPAIRERS (Isa. 58:12-14).

   What names are given to those whose religious life is directed
toward service for others? Isa. 58:12.


    The restoration and sharing of Bible truth always involves com-
passionate ministry to the needy. The doctrines of God's Word,
revived by the various phases of the sixteenth-century Reformation,
created new communities of Christians committed to more exalted
ethical and moral standards, and directed toward ministry for others.
But the Reformation left much of the golden ore of truth unmined.
The remnant (Rev. 12:17) are builders of "the old waste places," in
the sense that they revive the truths of God's Word buried by centu-
ries of neglect.
   "Here are given the characteristics of those who shall be reform-
ers, who will bear the banner of the third angel's message, those who
avow themselves God's commandment-keeping people, and who
honor God, and are earnestly engaged, in the sight of all the universe,
in building up the old waste places. Who is it that calls them, The
repairers of the breach, The restorers of paths to dwell in? It is God.
Their names are registered in heaven as reformers, restorers, as
raising the foundations of many generations."—Ellen G. White Com-
ments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 1151.

  What is the final call of those who "build the old waste places"?
Rev. 14:12; 18:1-4.


   "As the end approaches, the testimonies of God's servants will
become more decided and more powerful, flashing the light of truth
upon the systems of error and oppression that have so long held the
supremacy. The Lord has sent us messages for this time to establish
Christianity upon an eternal basis, and all who believe present truth
must stand, not in their own wisdom, but in God; and raise up the
foundation of many generations. These will be registered in the
books of heaven as repairers of the breach, the restorers of paths to
dwell in. We are to maintain the truth because it is truth, in the face of
the bitterest opposition. God is at work upon human minds; it is not
man alone that is working. The great illuminating power is from
Christ; the brightness of His example is to be kept before the people
in every discourse."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 4, p. 1152.

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SABBATH AND
SERVICE (Isa. 56:1-8; 58:13, 14).

   What promise is given to Sabbath reformers? Isa. 56:1-8;
58:13, 14.


   True Sabbath observers "keep justice and do righteousness" (Isa.
56:1, RSV). Heaven accepts their works as righteous because they
result from their born-again fellowship with Christ. (See 1 John 2:29;
3:7.) By allowing Christ to rule in their lives, they refrain from
"doing any evil" (Isa. 56:2, RSV; compare Rom. 6:18). They "hold
fast my [God's] covenant" (Isa. 56:4, RSV) because His law is
written on their hearts (Heb. 8:10-12).
   Isaiah 58:13, 14, in the context of the chapter, emphasizes that
true Sabbath observance, like true fasting, is inextricably bound up
with rejection of sin and with loving service for others. The Sabbath
was not given as leisure time in which we are to focus exclusively on
our own physical and spiritual needs. The Sabbath is a day for
ministry, not only by preachers but by every committed Seventh-day
Adventist.
   Sabbathkeeping of the right sort is possible only when Jesus
Christ is our delight, our Pearl of great price, our loving and loved
Saviour. Then His day becomes fragrant with the memory of His
Creation and salvation for us. A heartfelt observance of the Sabbath
constitutes a seal of loyalty to God and His law (Ex. 31:12-17; Rev.
7:1-3).

  What last-day message makes possible the restoration of the
Sabbath? Rev. 14:6-12.


   "The message of the third angel will be proclaimed. As the time
comes for it to be given with greatest power, the Lord will work
through humble instruments, leading the minds of those who conse-
crate themselves to His service. The laborers will be qualified rather
by the unction of His Spirit than by the training of literary institu-
tions. Men of faith and prayer will be constrained to go forth with
holy zeal, declaring the words which God gives them. The sins of
Babylon will be laid open. The fearful results of enforcing the observ-
ances of the church by civil authority, the inroads of Spiritualism, the
stealthy but rapid progress of the papal power—all will be unmasked.
By these solemn warnings the people will be stirred."—The Great
Controversy, p. 606.


                                                                     75

FURTHER STUDY: On the importance of obedience to God and
service for Him and others read: 1 Sam. 15:22, 23; Ps. 40:5-11; Prov.
21:3; Isa. 1:11-17. Read Prophets and Kings, pp. 677, 678; Testimo-
nies, vol. 2, pp. 231, 232; The Great Controversy, pp. 447, 452, 453;
The Desire of Ages, p. 278.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Have you ever fasted? Why? For health reasons'? Religious
     reasons? What benefit did you gain?

     2. What kind of fasting could be dangerous to your health?

     3. In what way should Isaiah's definition of the fast God has
        chosen make any difference in your life'?

     4. Is Isaiah 58 more applicable to the last days than to Isaiah's
        historical situation? Why, or why not?

     5. Have you ever seriously thought of yourself as a restorer or a
        repairer, a sort of spiritual repair person? If so, what specific
        contribution do you see yourself as making by means of the
        power bestowed by God's Spirit?

     6. Tell how the observance of the true Sabbath can become a
        "delight."

SUMMARY: God's true people in the last days will distinguish
themselves in their mission—first to the poor and downtrodden by
their community services, second by their healing ministry to the
sick, and third by their teaching of Bible truth. They will restore the
law of God to its rightful place, exalt Jesus as the foundation of their
faith, and repair the breach in God's law by giving the Sabbath its
rightful place of honor.

         tugal. Many of these refugees come from Angola, a country torn
         by civil war. Refugees often are quite receptive to the gospel.
         Some of these refugees already know about the Adventist church
         or have attended the church services in their homeland. Some
         have Seventh-day Adventist relatives.
             Many of the African Adventists already living in Portugal
         also came to this country to escape the civil war, or to search for
         better living conditions. Now they have united in an effort to
         reach and win the new refugees for Christ.
             The unity of the African Portuguese-speaking Adventist com-
         munity is amazing. Most came from warring sections of Angola,
         from tribes that fought fiercely among themselves. Now they
         put aside their old tribal quarrels and live in peace and harmony,
         united in the common project of bringing the good news to their
         compatriots. Recently one of these brothers summed up their
         experience in the following words: "If our families in Angola
          knew how united we are as we work peacefully together, they
         simply wouldn't believe it!"
             This unity.and brotherly love is only possible by the power of
          the Holy Spirit that can bring us together as a people working in
         a soul-winning project. For these African brothers and sisters,
          Global Mission means an opportunity to work for the salvation
          of their fellow countrymen regardless of their differing ethnic
          backgrounds or the ancient hatred that might separate them.
          This work is so challenging that a young African pastor, re-
          cently graduated from the French Seminary in Collonges, has
          been appointed to lead out in this Global Mission project.

           "When Shall These
             Things Be?"




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Matt. 23:37-25:46.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an
     hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh" (Matthew 24:44).

   KEY THOUGHT: Jesus revealed the events that would occur
shortly before His second advent, because He wants His people to be
spiritually prepared to meet Him.

   THE SETTING OF MATTHEW 24 AND 25. Jesus had just
openly exposed the hypocrisy of the scribes and Pharisees (Matthew
23). He solemnly declared, "Behold, your house is left unto you
desolate" (Matt. 23:38). As Jesus left the temple area, His disciples
pointed out the magnificent white stones that comprised the beautiful
structure. Jesus replied that the time would come when not one stone
would be left standing upon another. The disciples asked, "When
will this be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the close
of the age?" (Matt. 24:3, RSV).
   In His reply, Jesus foretold events that would illustrate the nature of
the events surrounding His advent. "The prophecy which He uttered was
twofold in its meaning; while foreshadowing the destruction of Jerusa-
lem, it prefigured also the terrors of the last great day." "The Saviour's
prophecy concerning the visitation of judgments upon Jerusalem is to
have another fulfillment, of which that terrible desolation was but a faint
shadow."—The Great Controversy, pp. 25, 36.

Sunday                                                  March 5
THE GATHERING STORM (Matt. 24:4-14).

   In His discourse Jesus did not describe the destruction of Jerusa-
lem in some sections and His second coming in others. "He mingled
the description of these two events. . . . In mercy to them He blended
the description of the two great crises, leaving the disciples to study
out the meaning for themselves. . . . This entire discourse was given,
not for the disciples only, but for those who should live in the last
scenes of this earth's history."—The Desire of Ages, p. 628 (italics
supplied; see The Great Controversy, p. 25).

  Applying the principles of interpretation outlined above, how
would you relate Jesus' predictions in Matthew 24:4-8 to our
day?


   The twentieth century has witnessed the three phenomena men-
tioned in these verses to an extent unprecedented in history—the
claims of false messiahs, the most devastating wars in history, and
famines and earthquakes of great extent and frequency. The recent
famines in Africa and Eastern Europe dramatically fulfill Jesus'
prediction. The history of earthquakes, from the Lisbon earthquake
of 1755 to the more recent quakes in such places as California, Japan,
Chile, Peru, Morocco, the Soviet Union, and Mexico, testifies to the
truth of Jesus' words.

  What events can we expect as the final effort is being made to
preach the gospel worldwide? Matt. 24:9-14.


   The hatred shown to God's remnant people is in view of their
determination to obey, through the power of Christ, all God's com-
mandments, including the seventh-day Sabbath command. (See Rev.
12:17; 13:15-17; 14:9-11.) Professed believers who give in to the
demands of nations that they break the Sabbath command will betray
their former brothers and sisters (Matt. 24:10).
   "As the storm approaches, a large class who have professed faith
in the third angel's message, but have not been sanctified through
obedience to the truth, abandon their position and join the ranks of
the opposition. . . . Men of talent and pleasing address, who once
rejoiced in the truth, employ their powers to deceive and mislead
souls. They become the most bitter enemies of their former breth-
ren."—The Great Controversy, p. 608.



                                                                     79

MIDNIGHT DARKNESS (Matt. 24:15-28).

  What events fulfill Jesus' forecasts contained in Matthew 24:15-
22? Compare Dan. 8:13, 14; 9:27; 11:31; 12:11.


   The work of the "little horn" described in Daniel 8:9-14 estab-
lishes "the transgression that makes desolate" (Dan. 8:13, RSV), or
"the abomination that makes desolate" (Dan. 11:31, RSV). Jesus was
referring to "the desolating sacrilege spoken of by the prophet Daniel"
(Matt. 24:15, RSV), which does not finally end until the second
coming of Jesus. (See Dan. 8:25; compare 2:45.)
   The tribulation of Matthew 24:15-22 has a threefold application:

   1. The armies of Rome led by Cestius besieged Jerusalem late in
A.D. 66. Cestius withdrew, and the Christians escaped from the city.
Finally Jerusalem was overthrown and the temple destroyed by the
armies of Titus in A.D. 70.
    "[Matt. 24:15, 16 quoted. . . .] When the idolatrous standards of
the Romans should be set up in the holy ground, which extended
some furlongs outside the city walls, then the followers of Christ
were to find safety in flight."
   "Not one Christian perished in the destruction of Jerusalem."
—The Great Controversy, pp. 26, 30. (See Ellen G. White Com-
ments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 1145.)

   2. The tribulation also refers to the work of the church-state union
of the Middle Ages in Europe, which enforced an unbiblical mode of
worship. (See The Great Controversy, pp. 39, 266, 267.) Once again
God's faithful people were forced to flee.

   3. The tribulation Jesus mentioned also refers to the events shortly
before His second advent when, once again, the papal power, united
with spiritism and apostate Protestantism, will dictate to the world.
(Compare Matt. 24:21; Dan. 12:2; 2 Thess. 2:7, 8; Rev. 19:20.)
   "The time is not far distant, when, like the early disciples, we shall
be forced to seek a refuge in desolate and solitary places. As the siege
of Jerusalem by the Roman armies was the signal for flight to the
Judean Christians, so the assumption of power on the part of our
nation in the decree enforcing the papal sabbath will be a warning to
us. [See Matt. 24:20.] It will then be time to leave the large cities,
preparatory to leaving the smaller ones for retired homes in secluded
places among the mountains."—Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 464, 465.
(See The Great Controversy, pp. 36, 37; SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 4, p. 1166.)

THE SON OF MAN COMES (Matt. 24:29-31).

   At what stage in history do the dark day and the falling of the
stars occur? Matt. 24:29 (compare verses 21, 22).


   As we have seen, the great tribulation of Matthew 24:21, 22 refers
to the suffering of the chosen people in A.D. 70, the persecutions of
Bible-loving believers during the Middle Ages, and the persecution
of Christ's loyal people shortly before He comes. (The tribulation
during the period of papal supremacy [A.D. 538-1798; Dan. 7:25]
largely ended before 1798. See Matt. 24:22; Mark 13:24.)
    The two great historical tribulations (A.D. 70 and 538-1798) were
types or examples of the ultimate tribulation that will occur after the
end-time church-state union enforces "the desolating sacrilege" (Matt.
24:15, RSV). Daniel speaks of this tribulation commencing before
the close of probation (Dan. 11:44). Then comes the close of proba-
tion after which "there shall be a time of trouble, such as never has
been" (Dan. 12:1, RSV).
    The dark day and the falling of the stars refer to:

   (1) natural events after the worst persecutions of the medieval and
early modern period (Mark 13:24)—the dark day of May 19, 1780
and the meteoric shower of November 13, 1833. (See The Great
Controversy, pp. 306, 307, 333, 334.)

   (2) The events at the conclusion of the end-time tribulation, im-
mediately prior to the Day of the Lord, the second coming of Jesus.
(See Isa. 13:9-11; 34:1-4; Eze. 32:7, 8; Joel 2:10, 11, 30-32; Rev.
6:12, 13.) "With shouts of triumph, jeering, and imprecation, throngs
of evil men are about to rush upon their prey, when, lo, a dense
blackness, deeper than the darkness of the night, falls upon the
earth."—The Great Controversy, p. 334.

   Will Jesus' second coming be a secret or a public event? What
happens when He comes? Matt. 24:30, 31 (compare 1 Thess.
4:16-18; 1 Cor. 15:51-54; Rev. 1:7).


   All earth's lost inhabitants mourn when they see Jesus coming,
because they are not spiritually ready to meet Him. (See Rev. 6:15-
17.) But God's faithful people are ready. Those who died believing
are raised (1 Thess. 4:16), and with the living believers are gathered
by the angels to meet the Lord in the air (verse 17). Together they are
taken to the heavenly kingdom (John 14:3; Rev. 7:13-17).

                                                                     81
Wednesday                                                 March 8
PREPARING TO MEET THE LORD (Matt. 24:32-51).

 How can we be sure that the second coming of Jesus is near?
Matt. 24:32-35.


   Jesus pointed out that no one has difficulty in detecting the com-
ing of summer. Springtime is a beautiful time of promise and renewal
in nature. Even so, those who witness the final signs of Jesus' coming
will live to see the Second Advent.

   What will be the state of our world socially and morally in the
period just prior to Jesus' advent? Matt. 24:36-38. How did Jesus
intend us to follow His counsel in verses 42-44? 1 Thess. 5:1-23.


    Postmillennialists argue that Christ will come after 1,000 years of
peace on earth. They point to vast improvements in the human
situation, economically, morally, and spiritually. But Jesus taught
that world conditions will become progressively worse until He
comes to end the night of gloom. (Compare 2 Tim. 3:1-5; 2 Peter 3:3-
7.)
    By following the counsel contained in 1 Thessalonians 5:1-23 and
other passages, we are to draw progressively nearer to the Lord and,
by His indwelling Spirit, experience victory over sin. (See 2 Cor.
7:1.) We are to "come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge
of the Son of God, to maturity, to the measure of the full stature of
Christ" (Eph. 4:13, NRSV).

   Apart from being prepared ourselves, what is our responsibil-
ity to others? Matt. 24:45-51.


    Every Christian believer has been set over some feature of Christ's
household (verse 45). We each have a spiritual responsibility to those
around us, not to "beat" others because they do not see things our
way, but to gently lead them to the Saviour. To enjoy the blessings
the church has to offer, to revel in the spiritual delights the Lord
provides, while exercising little or no effort to give others "their food
at the proper time" is to fail dismally in the task Jesus has given us.

   How do you answer for yourself the issues raised in the
 above paragraph?

THE STATE OF THE CHURCH BEFORE JESUS COMES
(Matt. 25:1-46).

 What is the central message in the parable of the ten virgins?
Matt. 25:1-13.


   The three parables of Matthew 25 warn us of spiritual unprepared-
ness in the period when our Lord's return is delayed. These parables
also reveal the two classes that will coexist in the last-day church—
those who have sufficient oil in their lamps and those who do not. In
the parable of the ten virgins, the lamps represent the Word of God.
(See Ps. 119:105.) The oil represents the Holy Spirit dwelling in the
hearts of believers. (See Zech. 4:1-6.)
   "Without the Spirit of God a knowledge of His word is of no avail.
The theory of truth, unaccompanied by the Holy Spirit, cannot quicken
the soul or sanctify the heart. One may be familiar with the com-
mands and promises of the Bible; but unless the Spirit of God sets the
truth home, the character will not be transformed. Without the en-
lightenment of the Spirit, men will not be able to distinguish truth
from error, and they will fall under the masterful temptations of
Satan."--Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 408-411.

  In the parable of the talents (Matt. 25:14-30), why did the
master take a servant's one talent and give it to the servant who
had ten talents (verse 28)?


   The greatest talent available to Christian believers is the gift of the
Holy Spirit (John 14:15-24). He imparts spiritual gifts to all those
who come to Christ (1 Cor. 12:8-11). In addition, everyone has
natural endowments, inherited or cultivated abilities. Empowered by
the Holy Spirit, we have the capacity to employ all these talents in
Christ's service.
   Until Christ comes, there will be those who are cooperating with
the Spirit in using their talents, and others who are refusing to
cooperate, burying their abilities. Talents unused are ultimately tal-
ents lost.

    In the parable of the great judgment scene (Matt. 25:31-46),
 how did Jesus suggest we should all employ our talents? What
 does this message have to do with righteousness and salvation
 by faith? What is the one reason Jesus saves some and rejects
 others? In the light of this, are you ready to meet Him?


                                                                       83
Friday                                                 March 10
FURTHER STUDY: On preparation to meet Christ read Joel 2:28-
32, Rom. 13:11-14, Titus 2:11-15, and Rev. 3:1-5. Read "On the
Mount of Olives" in The Desire of Ages, pp. 627-636.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Why did Jesus provide signs of the times for the church? Give
     at least three reasons.

     2. In the light of the many forecasts of Jesus' second advent,
        would you say that there is much or little yet to be fulfilled?

     3. Why did not the Lord give us the exact day, month, and year of
        His appearing?

     4. In this, the time of the end, are we looking for and hastening
        the advent of the Lord? How can we hasten (2 Peter 3:12) His
        return? 1 John 3:1-3.

     5. How would you explain to a questioner why Seventh-day
        Adventists are so focused on the end of the world?

SUMMARY: In Matthew 24 Jesus traces prophetically the future of
His church in the Christian Era; first, in connection with the destruc-
tion of Jerusalem; second, during the great tribulation period of the
Middle Ages; third, in the time of the end, just prior to His second
advent. History repeats itself. The events of history illustrate the
events of the end time. The triumph of the gospel is assured and, in
spite of horrendous times of persecution, Jesus calls for patient
endurance and warns of the danger of eternal loss. Because the return
of Christ is imminent, as the fulfilling signs indicate, Scripture chal-
lenges us to identify with the wise virgins, who represented Spirit-
filled believers.

                             A Missionary to Earth
                                   Terri Jean Webb

              "Last call for Flight 892 to San Francisco." Oh, no! It's still
          not my flight, I thought. I had been sitting in the Narita Airport in
          Japan for five hours, awaiting the connecting flight that would
          take my parents and me to the Philippines. The longer I sat there
          feeling miserable, the more resentment grew inside me. How
          could I ever have agreed to be dragged halfway around the
          world to the Philippines? I am so hungry and thirsty! I would
          love to buy a soda, but it costs more than $3.00! Is this what my
          life will be like for the next two years? Anger grew inside me.
              With these angry thoughts rolling around in my mind, I stretched
          on the seats to take nap. I fell into a troubled sleep and began to
          dream. In my dream I saw a panoramic view of Christ's life. I
          saw Him leave His holy, sinless home in heaven to come to our
          sinful earth. I saw him lying in a wretched stable with smelly
          cows. I saw Him being ridiculed by his brothers. I saw Him in
          the Garden of Gethsemane, His face twisted in agony. I heard
          him breathe the words "Not my will, but Thine." I saw Him on
          the cross as the soldier pierced His side.
              I awoke with a start. I felt as if tons of guilt were laid on my
          heart. What was I complaining about? Sure, I had to leave my
          friends and family. But at least, I can go back home in two years.
          Jesus chose to go through a whole lifetime of humiliation, ridi-
          cule and torment! And He died on the cross, not for His sins, but
          for mine! Wow! I guess giving just two short years isn't so bad. I
           slid to my knees and prayed. "Thank You, Jesus, for giving me a
           chance to be a missionary to the Philippines. And thanks for
           being a missionary to Earth!"

            The Gospel for the
                End-Time




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Rev. 14:1-20; 15:2-4.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Here is the patience of the saints: here are
     they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of
     Jesus" (Revelation 14:12).

  KEY THOUGHT: The Lord will give spiritual victory to those
who respond to the three angels' messages and remain true to Him.
He will "reap" them from the earth at Jesus' second coming.

    REVELATION 14 PRESENTS HEAVEN'S LAST APPEAL
TO A FALLEN WORLD. Verses 1-5 describe the character of the
redeemed saints who live through the tribulation of the last days and
who will stand triumphant with Jesus on the heavenly Mount Zion.
Verses 6-14 describe the messages that shape the characters of God's
people. These are the messages they proclaim to the world. Moti-
vated and empowered by angels of mercy, believers are sent by God
to minister messages of salvation to the whole world. Verses 15-20
depict a second trio of angels, who give the command to harvest the
ripe sheaves of grain and supervise the awful judgment upon the
world of impenitent souls. Then Jesus returns in power and glory
seated on the throne, to awaken the righteous dead and translate the
living saints.
   The three angels' messages proclaimed by God's people prepare
those who respond to stand triumphant when Jesus appears (Rev.
6:17; 15:2-4). They have overcome the deceptions of Satan and are
qualified to enter the perfection of the eternal world.

GOD'S SEAL FOR THE SAVED (Rev. 7:1-8; Rev. 14:1-5).

  What is the seal in the foreheads of the 144,000? (Compare
Rev. 7:1-3 with 14:1.)


    First, we should note that 144,000 are standing on "Mount Zion"
(Rev. 14:1, RSV). This is the heavenly Jerusalem (Heb. 12:22).
Because they were sealed on earth, they could be translated to heaven
at Jesus' second coming. (See John 14:1-3.)
    Second, we should note that the seal in their foreheads (Rev. 7:3)
is "his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads" (Rev.
14:1, RSV). Because Christ's name and the Father's name are sym-
bols of their character (Ps. 18:49), we conclude that the 144,000 have
been given the character of God by the indwelling Holy Spirit (Rom.
8:9-17). The earthly high priest wore "the golden plate, the holy
crown" on his turban (Lev. 8:9, RSV), on which were the words,
"Holy to the Lord" (Ex. 39:30, RSV). Just so, because the 144,000
possess the holiness of Christ, they are set apart for a holy purpose.
    A further dimension to the seal is that in Scripture the words sign,
seal, and mark are sometimes used synonymously. (Compare Rev.
7:3 with Eze. 9:4, Rom. 4:11; Rev. 13:16, 17.) God's seal, or sign, of
the everlasting covenant relationship between Himself and His people
is the Sabbath (Ex. 31:13, 17; Eze. 20:12, 20). The end-time seal of
God (Rev. 7:3; 14:1) is given to those who are enjoying the fullness
of the righteousness-by-faith experience and who are faithfully ob-
serving the Sabbath.

   When do the 144,000 receive the end-time seal of God? Rev.
6:14-17; 7:1-3.


   The 144,000 are able to "stand" amidst the outpouring of God's
wrath at Jesus' second coming because before this event God will
have sealed them with His end-time seal. Moreover, Joel 2:28 pre-
dicts the "latter rain" outpouring of the Holy Spirit before the coming
of Jesus.
   Ellen White wrote, "Reference to our published works will show
our belief that the living righteous will receive the seal of God prior
to the close of probation."—Selected Messages, book 1, p. 66.

    Why must we seek to receive both the Holy Spirit's initial
 seal (Eph. 1:13, 14) and end-time seal (Rev. 7:3; 14:1)?



                                                                      87

HOW CAN WE BE AMONG THE 144,000? (Rev. 14:5).

     Who are the 144,000? Rev. 6:17; 7:1-8; 14:3, 4.


   To answer the question How can we be among the 144,000? we
must have some idea who the 144,000 are. When the impenitent are
crying out in despair at the second advent of Jesus (Rev. 6:14-16),
their question is "The great day of their wrath has come, and who can
stand before it?" (Rev. 6:17, RSV). John's answer is, the 144,000
who were sealed before the winds of strife were let loose, before the
close of probation. The 144,000 are the righteous living on the earth
when Jesus comes. They are "redeemed from the earth," "from among
men" (Rev. 14:3, 4). When Jesus comes, "we which are alive and
remain" (1 Thess. 4:17) are the 144,000.
   "These, having been translated from the earth, from among the
living, are counted as 'the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.'
Revelation 15:2, 3; 14:1-5. 'These are they which came out of great
tribulation;' they have passed through the time of trouble such as
never was since there was a nation; they have endured the anguish of
the time of Jacob's trouble; they have stood without an intercessor
through the final outpouring of God's judgments. But they have been
delivered, for they have 'washed their robes, and made them white in
the blood of the Lamb.' "—The Great Controversy, p. 649.
   Why do we regard the number 144,000 as symbolic of the total
number of the sealed believers when Jesus comes? (1) Because the
prophecy is symbolic. The "four corners," the "four winds," the
"east," the "seal," the "earth," "sea," "trees," are all symbols (Rev.
7:1-3). Likewise, the 12 tribes are symbols; they do not exist today in
that form. The 144,000 are not only Jews. The number 144,000 (12
times 12 times 1,000) is a symbol of perfect symmetry, spiritual
perfection. (See Rev. 21:12, 14-17, 27.)

   What must our characters be like if we are to be among God's
living people when Jesus comes? Rev. 14:5 (compare Eph. 1:4;
5:27; Col. 1:22; Jude 24).


    "None but those who have been overcoming by the blood of
 the Lamb and the word of their testimony will be found with
 the loyal and true, without spot or stain of sin, without guile in
 their mouths. We must be divested of our self-righteousness
 and arrayed in the righteousness of Christ."—Selected Mes-
 sages, book 2, p. 380.

THE VOICE OF THE FIRST ANGEL (Rev. 14:6, 7).

  What is the heart and soul of the first angel's proclamation?
Rev. 14:6.


   The "everlasting" (KJV) or "eternal" (RSV) gospel is good news
containing a number of emphases: (1) Jesus is the Lamb of God, who
died for the sins of the whole world and arose from the dead (1 Cor.
15:1-4). (2) Because Jesus intercedes for us in the heavenly sanctu-
ary, applying the merits of His sacrifice, all our sins can be forgiven
(1 Tim. 2:5; 1 John 1:9; 2:1). (3) We can have the righteousness of
Christ in our hearts by the Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:1-10). (4) Jesus will
return to make eternal life a reality for those who believe (John 3:36;
1 Peter 5:10).
   The gospel message is so important that it takes on global signifi-
cance. It must be proclaimed worldwide before Jesus comes (Matt.
24:14).

   Because the message of the first angel is the gospel, the special
features of this proclamation must be part of the gospel. What
are those features? Rev. 14:7.


   The first angel's message is a solemn call to return to Creator-
worship.
   "Fear God": To fear God is not to be afraid of Him, but to give
Him reverence and respect, to do His will. The distinction between
being afraid of God and reverencing Him is spelled out in Exodus
20:20.
   "Give glory to him": We glorify God by allowing Him to live out
His life through us (Gal. 2:20) so that our characters are a reflection
of His (John 17:22, 23).
   "The hour of his judgment is come": Because the end comes
after the gospel has gone into all the world, the judgment, which is
announced as part of the gospel message, must occur before the end
of the world. (See Dan. 7:9-14, 21, 22, 25-27; 8:14.) Daniel 8:14;
9:24-27 pinpoint the beginning of the pre-advent judgment as 1844.
Christ's righteousness qualifies us to stand in the judgment.
   "Worship him that made": God is to be worshiped because He is
the Creator of heaven and earth. This takes us back to the origin of
humanity and the world, back to Genesis 1 and 2. God created our
world in six days and six nights, and rested on the seventh day,
setting it apart as the day to worship Him as Creator. (See Isa. 56:1,
2; 58:13, 14; Matt. 24:20.)

                                                                     89
Wednesday                                                March 15
THE SECOND ALARM (Rev. 14:8).

   What startling announcement does the second angel make
concerning the city of Babylon? What does "Babylon" symbol-
ize? Why does it fall? Rev. 14:8.


    The Medes and Persians conquered the literal city of Babylon in
the days of Belshazzar (Daniel 5). Centuries before, the Tower of
Babel fell when God toppled the tower. The rebellious builders found
themselves speaking in foreign tongues, unable to understand one
another. They spread out over the plains and populated the earth,
leaving behind them the ruins produced by their false worship. (See
Gen. 11:1-9.)
    The second angel's message does not refer to the literal history of
an ancient kingdom. It is a call to abandon the worship espoused and
taught by the false religious system of today, the "Babylon" of
apostasy.
    In 1843 and 1844 the loyal Adventists who had announced the
first angel's message with power, also proclaimed the second angel's
message. It applied to those people in the popular churches who had
heard the warning message and refused to accept it. Now the popular
churches had fallen, and the Lord turned from them to bestow His
blessing upon those who had accepted the light.

   Because modern "Babylon" began with the false teachings
that came into the early Christian church, why do we believe that
Revelation 14:8 applies especially in our day? What prophetic
evidence is provided by Revelation 17:1-6, 15-18; 18:1-4 that the
message announcing the fall of Babylon is especially relevant in
our contemporary world?


   Any church that accepts the nonbiblical doctrines taught by the
medieval church can be regarded as a daughter of "Babylon the great,
the mother of harlots" (Rev. 17:5). Those doctrines include: (1)
Sunday sacredness; (2) the immortality of the soul; (3) an eternally
burning hell; (4) the belief that human works contribute to our justifi-
cation; (5) the contention that Christ is not the only Head of the
church; (6) that priests can forgive sins.
   More recent falsehoods taught by popular churches include: (1)
salvation by grace releases us from keeping the Ten Commandments;
(2) Christ is not the Deity in the fullest sense; (3) Christ will translate
His people to heaven by means of a secret rapture.

Thursday                                              March 16
THE THIRD ANGEL'S MESSAGE (Rev. 14:9-12).

   Explain the warning sounded by the third angel. Rev. 14:9-11.
Identify the beast of Revelation 13:1-10; the mark of the beast
(verses 11-17); the image and the number of the beast (verse 18).


   "The Sabbath question will be the issue in the great conflict in
which all the world will act a part [Rev. 13:4-8, 10 quoted]. . . . This
entire chapter is a revelation of what will surely take place [Rev.
13:11, 15-17 quoted]. . . .
   "The third angel's message has been sent forth to the world,
warning men against receiving the mark of the beast or of his image
in their foreheads or in their hands. To receive this mark means to
come to the same decision as the beast has done, and to advocate the
same ideas, in direct opposition to the Word of God."—Ellen G.
White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 979. (See the
last half of "God's Law Immutable," The Great Controversy,
pp. 437-450.)
   The third angel's message is intended to point us to Christ as the
source of righteousness and salvation. Those who maintain faith in
Christ, experiencing the gift of His righteousness and the joy of
present salvation, will be immune from the terrible judgments upon
unbelievers (Rev. 14:12). If they die before Jesus comes, they are
assured the blessing of eternal life (verse 13).

   Is the fire of God's judgment an endless burning? Rev. 14:11.
Is the "eternal fire" that fell on Sodom still burning? Jude 7
(compare 2 Peter 2:6).


   How does John describe the second coming of Christ? Rev.
14:14-16. What signal does Christ give to reap the harvest of His
saints? Verse 15. What does the picture of a winepress filled with
ripe grapes symbolize (verses 17-20)?


   These six dramatic verses (15-20), while punctuated with God's
judgment and wrath, are also brightened by the radiant pictures of
deliverance for the Lord's suffering saints. The hour has come at last
for the dividing of the sheep and the goats (Matt. 25:31-46), the wise
and foolish virgins (Matt. 25:1-13). (See The Great Controversy,
p. 650.)



                                                                      91
Friday                                                   March 17
FURTHER STUDY: Noah had a warning message for the ante-
diluvians (Gen. 6:3-7; 2 Peter 2:5). Elijah brought the message of
decision to apostate Israel in the days of King Ahab (1 Kings 18:1-
46). Lot witnessed in Sodom (Luke 17:28-30). John the Baptist
proclaimed the arrival of the Saviour (Mark 1:7-11). Wycliffe in
England, Huss in Bohemia, Luther in Germany, Zwingli and Calvin
in Switzerland, Knox in Scotland, Miller in America—all proclaimed
the gospel. Likewise, Adventists are to sound the Elijah message
prior to the Second Advent (Mal. 4:5, 6).
   Read "The Final Warning" in The Great Controversy, pp. 603-
612.

 DISCUSSION QUESTION:
  1. Why do you think so many writers on religious themes tend to
     avoid the book of Revelation?

     2. How can we restate the second and third angels' messages in
        more positive terms?

     3. Why is it especially important to teach the first angel's mes-
        sage along with the other two?

     4. A friend cannot understand why God endeavors to arrest the
        attention of nonbelievers by the terrible threat of punishment
        in the third angel's message. How would you explain this?

SUMMARY: In the three angels' messages one can feel the strong
heart-longings of the Creator God for His earthly children. At differ-
ent crises in the church and in the world God has commissioned His
messengers to go to the people with the warning message, the
eleventh-hour call, the third alarm, the last call. The three alarms of
the trio of angels of Revelation 14 are the final call to earth's inhabit-
ants. The issues center in God's holy law, His sovereignty, and the
transforming grace of Jesus Christ in the gospel. Eternal life is the
gift for those who accept it.

                      God Changed Me
                        Dimiter Stoyanov

   My name is Dimiter Stoyanov. I am a Gypsy, living in Bul-
garia with my wife and two little children. I have been handi-
                                                                            I
capped all my life and must walk with crutches, but this did not
prevent me from going from town to town cheating people,
selling false gold jewelry, and using counterfeit money. Many
                                                                            n
people in the towns and villages of Bulgaria would like to beat
me to death if they saw me.
   I have led a violent life. I drank and smoked, and I never
looked after the needs of my family. Most of the local criminals
protected me when I needed to escape.
   One day, I heard that an American evangelist was holding
some meetings for the Gypsy community nearby. Like most
Gypsies, I scoffed at Christians, and my friends and I decided to
                                                                            i
attend the meetings—to rob the evangelist! I went to the meet-
ing and stood behind the stage. I half listened as the evangelist,
Robert Wagley, spoke of the love of God to all sinners. I do not
                                                                            d
know what happened to me, but something broke in my heart,
and I began to cry. This was the first time I had considered
letting God into my life.
    From that moment on, my life was changed. I gave up alco-
                                                                            e
hol and cigarettes immediately. The change surprised my friends
and relatives. I began studying the Bible, and was baptized
together with 200 other Gypsies in my community.
    The police do not yet know of the change in my life. They
still are looking for me for crimes I have committed. I owe much
 money to the bank and to individuals, but I know that with
God's help, I can repay my debts and more. There is nothing
                                                                            S
 impossible for God. Now my greatest desire is to help my wife
 and family to know Jesus and His power to change lives.

          God's Care in Storm
              and Stress




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ps. 91:1-16; Ps. 46:1-11.

     MEMORY VERSE: "He that dwelleth in the secret place of
     the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I
     will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God;
     in him will I trust" (Psalm 91:1, 2).


   KEY THOUGHT: In times of trial, God's faithful people are
assured of His constant presence, protection, and reassurance. Even
when the Lord chooses to allow His people to suffer physically, He is
an impenetrable fortress against their spiritual enemies.

   GOD PROVIDES SHELTER IN TIME OF STORM. "In the
ninety-first psalm is a most wonderful description of the coming of
the Lord to bring the wickedness of the wicked to an end, and to give
to those who have chosen Him as their Redeemer the assurance of
His love and protecting care. . . .
   "In the time when God's judgments are falling without mercy, oh,
how enviable to the wicked will be the position of those who abide
`in the secret place of the Most High'—the pavilion in which the
Lord hides all who have loved Him and have obeyed His command-
ments! . . . But the door of mercy is closed to the wicked, no more
prayers are offered in their behalf, after probation ends.
   "But this time has not yet come. Mercy's sweet voice is still to be
heard. The Lord is now calling sinners to come to Him."—Ellen G.
White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1150.

GOD OUR REFUGE AND DWELLING PLACE (Ps. 91:1; Ps.
46:1-3).

   Why can we be sure of God's protection in time of trouble? Ps.
91:1; 46:1-3.


   Among the most quoted verses of Scripture is the Lord's promise
in Psalm 91:1 of His sheltering care and protection in the soon-to-
come time of trouble. The promise is embossed, as it were, lifted
high above many verses of Scripture—comforting words, poetic and
warmly descriptive. The Lord is a refuge in time of storm, a fortress,
a safe place beneath His outstretched wings, and His truth a shield to
guide and to protect.

  How did David's personal life and experience prepare him to
write this prophetic psalm? Ps. 32:1-11.


   Saul's pursuit of David taught the future king of Israel that there is
no other refuge than God. After his sin with Bathsheba and the
murder of Uriah the Hittite, David found God to be a shelter, a
forgiving Lord, One who still accepted him in spite of his fall (Ps.
51:1-10). The subsequent tragedies in his family life brought David
to his knees in total dependence upon God. He had already experi-
enced a time of trouble, and he knew he could depend upon God.

   In what ways does Psalm 91 have meaning for God's children
in every age? Deut. 33:27-29; Acts 5:17-21; Rev. 2:10.


   God is eternally present with His people generation after genera-
tion. He is with us today and will be with us until the end, even
during that "time of trouble, such as never was since there was a
nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be
delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book" (Dan.
12:1). Consider Jesus' promise in Matthew 28:20, "Lo, I am with you
alway, even unto the end of the world."

    What testimony can you give of the protecting, guiding hand
 of the Lord in your life? How would you explain to an enquirer
 that, although God always provides spiritual shelter for His
 people, there are times when He allows trial and tragedy to
 come upon them?


                                                                       95

THE PEOPLE WHO CLAIM GOD'S PROMISES (Ps. 91:2).

   How would you describe those who "dwell in the secret place
of the most High"? Ps. 91:1, 2, 9, 14, 15.


   Those who are extended the protection of the Almighty, who
abide under the shadow of the Most High, are identified in different
ways in many Scripture passages:
   1. The sheep whom He leads in paths of righteousness (Ps. 23:3);
   2. The upright and truthful (Ps. 15:1-5);
   3. The wise virgins of Jesus' parable (Matt. 25:1-13);
   4. The blessed people of the beatitudes (Matt. 5:1-12);
   5. The lightbearers and salty saints (Matt. 5:13-16);
   6. Those who keep His Word (Rev. 3:10).

   "Not every one that saith, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom
of heaven" (Matt. 7:21). It is not ritual-ridden worshipers who dwell
in the shadow of the almighty, but godly people who communicate
with the Lord and with their fellow human beings. In times of
suffering, danger, and calamity, they are assured of God's sustaining
presence.

   What promises are made to those who abide in Christ? Rev.
3:10-12; Isa. 26:1-9.


    There are many "places" that capture our attention and demand
our time and affection. The family room with its VCR and television
set, the theater with its fantasy and allurements; the workplace that
demands so much of us, the stadium filled with powerful athletes—
all of these offer excitement and pleasure. But the secret place of the
Most High is the place of peace and rest, of strength and renewal.

   With what pertinent questions did Jeremiah confront back-
slidden Israel? Jer. 12:5. How would you personally answer these
questions?


    Not the Christian who occasionally prays and darts in and
 out of the "quiet place," but the Christian who "dwells" in
 God's presence "abides" under the constant shadow of God's
 care. Are you dwelling in His presence and enjoying the secu-
 rity that He brings? How do you know?

THE NATURE OF GOD'S DELIVERANCE (Ps. 91:3-7, 10,13,
16).

   From what perils are the people of the Lord delivered in the
time of trouble? Ps. 91:3-7.


   The idea of a covering is strongly emphasized in this psalm. The
figure is that of a mother hen sheltering her helpless brood from
attack by a swift flying falcon or predatory owl. The trusting chicks
press close to their mother, alert and watchful but not panicky. What
a figure by which to represent God's care for His children! Contrast
this with the actions of Greek, Roman, or Egyptian mythological
deities. We have a right to expect God, unlike false deities, to protect
us, since He created and redeemed us, and since all things are subject
to Him—all things. Even when, for reasons we do not know, the Lord
chooses to allow His people to suffer, they are assured of His unfail-
ing love and reassuring presence.

  What is the attitude of the Lord to those who do not accept His
Lordship? Ps. 91:8; Eze. 33:11.


   The righteous people of God actually see the punishment of the
wicked but experience no part in it themselves (Ps. 37:34). The
Israelite slaves saw the calamities that came upon their Egyptian
overlords. They stood in awe-struck silence as the Egyptians per-
ished in the Red Sea (Ex. 14:31).

   Will the people of God suffer when the end-time plagues are
being poured out (Revelation 16)? Ps. 91:10; 1 Peter 4:12-14, 19;
5:7-11. Can you give examples of innocent Bible characters who
suffered despite their innocence? What was the purpose of their
suffering?


  What special promises does the Lord make to His suffering
people? Ps. 91:9-13, 16.


   There have been times when, for reasons we will know only in the
kingdom, God has allowed His people to suffer calamity. Job is a
classic example. But we are assured that, in the great last-day time of
trouble after the close of probation, God will shelter those whom He
has eternally vindicated (Dan. 12:1).

                                                                      97

DANGERS THAT THREATEN THE PEOPLE OF GOD (Ps.
46:1-11).

   Consider the dangers that surround God's saints in the last day:
(1) earthquakes, Ps. 46:2, 3; Isa. 24:19-20; (2) floods, Ps. 46:2, 3;
Luke 21:25; (3) rage of the heathen, Ps. 46:6; Rev. 16:14; Rev.
11:18; (4) the breakup of the earth, Ps. 46:6; 2 Peter 3:10, 11; (5)
God's judgments, Ps. 46:8; Rev 16:20, 21; (6) weapons of war, Ps.
46:9; (7) hostile governments, Ps. 46:6, 10; Rev. 11:18.

   When God's people are feeling forsaken what is His attitude
toward them? Isa. 49:13-16; Ps. 13:1-6.


   J. Wilbur Chapman illustrates God's protecting providence: "Some
years ago the King of Abyssinia took a British subject prisoner. They
carried him to the fortress of Magdala, and in the heights of the
mountains put him in a dungeon, without cause assigned. Britain
demanded his instantaneous release. King Theodore refused, and in
less than ten days ten thousand British soldiers were on shipboard
and sailing down the coast. They marched seven hundred miles
beneath the burning sun, up the mountains to the very dungeon where
the prisoner was held, and there they gave battle. The gates were torn
down. Presently the prisoner was lifted upon their shoulders, carried
down the mountain, and placed upon the white-winged ship which
sped him in safety to his home. It cost the English government
$25,000,000 to release that man. I belong to a better kingdom than
that, and do you suppose that earthly powers will protect their sub-
jects and God will leave me without help?"—G. B. F. Hallock, ed.,
2,500 Best Modern Illustrations (New York: Harper & Brothers
Publishers, 1935), p. 288.

   Identify the manner in which God protected His faithful ones
in the following situations:

Dan. 3:13-28

Dan. 6:11-23

Acts 7:9, 10

   Cite an incident in which a servant of God was not delivered.
(For example, Stephen, Acts 7:54-60.) How have you been able
to reconcile yourself to your own suffering or that of a loved
one? Why are God's promises in Psalm 91 still valid?

ANGEL GUARDIANS (Ps. 91:11-16).

   Whom has God appointed to protect and "take charge" of His
people? Heb. 1:14; Ps. 103:19-21; 34:7. How large is the company
of guardian angels willing to do God's bidding? Dan. 7:9, 10
(compare Rev. 5:11; 2 Kings 6:11-19).


   "A guardian angel is appointed to every follower of Christ. These
heavenly watchers shield the righteous from the power of the wicked
one. This Satan himself recognized when he said: `Doth Job fear God
for nought? Hast not Thou made an hedge about him, and about his
house, and about all that he hath on every side?' (Job 1:9, 10)."—The
Great Controversy, pp. 512, 513.

   Describe the angel ministry in the last-day time of trouble. Ps.
91:11, 12.


   "Could men see with heavenly vision, they would behold compa-
nies of angels that excel in strength stationed about those who have
kept the word of Christ's patience. With sympathizing tenderness,
angels have witnessed their distress and have heard their prayers.
They are waiting the word of their Commander to snatch them from
their peril. But they must wait yet a little longer. The people of God
must drink of the cup and be baptized with the baptism. The very
delay, so painful to them, is the best answer to their petitions. As they
endeavor to wait trustingly for the Lord to work they are led to
exercise faith, hope, and patience, which have been too little exer-
cised during their religious experience. Yet for the elect's sake the
time of trouble will be shortened. . . . The end will come more
quickly than men expect. The wheat will be gathered and bound in
sheaves for the garner of God; the tares will be bound as fagots for
the fires of destruction."—The Great Controversy, pp. 630, 631.

  To whom are we indebted for the comparative peace we now
enjoy? Rev. 7:1-3.


    "Men cannot discern the sentinel angels restraining the four
 winds that they shall not blow until the servants of God are
 sealed; but when God shall bid His angels loose the winds, there
 will be such a scene of strife as no pen can picture."—Testimo-
 nies, vol. 6, p. 408.

FURTHER STUDY: On the question of suffering, study 1 Peter
4:12-19. On patient preparation to meet Jesus at His return, study
2 Peter 3:1-18. Read "The Time of Trouble" in The Great Contro-
versy, pp. 613-634.

 QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION:
  1. How can we know the Lord better than we do now?

   2. Is there any limit to the spiritual growth of one who is abiding
      in Christ? Will we continue to grow spiritually during the time
      of trouble? Does this mean that we will continue to sin and
      repent? (See Rev. 3:5; 19:7, 8; 22:11.)

   3. Why must Christians endure great trials and afflictions? Are
      they good for us or bad? Can we avoid much of the trouble we
      experience? How?


SUMMARY: Psalm 91 presents in 16 verses a positive attribution of
faith and confidence in the protection and care of God over His tried
and faithful people. This faith expressed by David and learned by
Israel's king through much affliction, is to become an expression of
our faith as we near the time of trouble. We too must learn to trust
God more fully and be prepared to live by faith during the disastrous
times ahead. The present state of danger in the world is but a breeze
compared with the storm soon to burst upon men and women every-
where. But we are assured: "When you pass through the waters I will
be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you;
when you walk through the fire you shall not be burned, and the
flame shall not consume you" (Isa. 43:2, RSV).

Global Mission
                             Creative Evangelism
    ISWAV                       James H. Zachary

             I stood in the parking lot of the General Santos Seventh-day
         Adventist Church in the South Philippines. The roar of motor-
         cycle engines in the distance grew louder. As they neared the
         church, they slowed down, then one by one they pulled into the
         church yard.
             These motorcycles, equipped with a side car, served the city
         as taxis. Each taxi driver was a member of the Adventist Taxi
         Association. The cyclists' leader excitedly told me that with
         their own funds they were conducting radio evangelism. One of
         their drivers was the "radio evangelist." Another was the an-
         nouncer. Their program had been on the air for several months.
             Now they were planning evangelistic meetings. All of the
         expenses would come from their club budget. No wonder the
         General Santos Church was overflowing with members! Satel-
         lite churches were planned in other parts of the city.
             The children in the primary division were also holding evan-
         gelistic meetings. They had targeted 20 non-Adventist parents
         in the school most of the students attended.
             The children divided topics into three or four sections, and
         memorized their sermonettes. Other children prepared special
         music, offered prayer, or announced the program. Parents were
         invited to come to the meetings.
             How touching it was to listen to a 7-year-old child tell the
         audience that Jesus is coming soon, and to hear a child's voice
         read the Scriptures with power and understanding.
              At the time of my visit, the children had reached half of their
         goal—ten parents were being prepared for baptism by the pas-
         tor.
              Members of the General Santos Church have learned some-
          thing every Adventist needs to know: Everyone's help is needed
                                 so that Global Mission can complete its
                                 task. What are you doing to help?

          It's Time for Action!
    Would you like your Sabbath School to be aglow with Christ's
love—a dynamic center of spiritual nurture and outreach? Would you
like your Sabbath School members to be genuinely caring for and
supporting one another while also reaching out systematically with
loving concern to inactive and former members? Would you like to see
them involved in united outreach to the community? Would you like to
see them offering greater assistance to the World Mission of the church?
     If you would like to see all this, and also experience virtually total
participation in lesson discussion combined with a significant increase
in daily lesson study and daily devotions, then Sabbath School Action
Units in your Sabbath School are the answer.
     Many Sabbath Schools have discovered that the small group Sab-
bath School class Action Unit can, if properly conducted, provide the
supporting fellowship and relevant nurture that is so greatly needed in
the church today. It can also provide the caring atmosphere, inspiration,
and training needed to bring our missing members back, so they will
stay and assist us in reaching the world with the Three Angels' Mes-
sages.
     When the Action Unit plan is followed, such warm interaction and
 mutual trust develop that the Sabbath School class members will not
allow any of their closely knit group to miss Sabbath School without
 immediately reaching out to them with concern. Loving class members
 immediately plug the "leak in the bucket," as it were, so it can be filled.
     What's it like to be a part of an Action Unit? Each week, members
share witnessing experiences and pray for specific individuals. But
 beware—it's contagious! When even one active class member shares
 what God is doing, others follow suit. And it's not long before everyone's
 involved in outreach.
      Here's just a sampling of the exciting results that occur when
 Sabbath School Action Units are put into action!
 The Plan Spreads Like Wildfire
    • Fifty churches, large and small, including the large Sao Paulo,
 Brazil, College (SAD), began following the plan within three months
 of its introduction.
     • The South Brazil Union Sabbath School Director says, "We are
 unable to meet the requests [for starting Action Units]. It is spreading
 like fire in the straw."
     • Eighty percent of the 441 churches in Negros Mission, Philippines
 (FED), responded to the plan within a six-month period.
     • Ninety percent of the churches of the North Mindahasa Mission,
  Indonesia (FED), began active outreach units within six months of
  being introduced to the plan.
  A Caring Atmosphere Prevails
     • Four non-Adventist husbands in California attended one Sabbath

                                                                        105
School to find out why their wives had changed so much.
Personal Bible Study Increases
   • A church in Michigan experienced an increase in daily lesson
study from 15 percent studying daily to 90 percent within two months.
 Sabbath School Attendance Increases
   • Sabbath School attendance jumped from 20 to 100 in only six
weeks at a church in Oregon.
   • A New Jersey Sabbath School reported an increase in attendance
from 15 (including children) to 70 (excluding children) within two
months.
Inactive Members Return
   • After starting the Action Unit plan, a church in Michigan reported
that 50 families returned to Sabbath School.
   • Four of 31 people who returned to a Sabbath School of 60 in
Michigan stated they were "impressed" to return.
   • Twenty-eight backsliders have returned to a church in India be-
cause of Action Units.
More Outreach
   • "I have more outreach in one small Sabbath School class than we
had in the entire church before," reports one pastor from one of the
more than 30 churches in the Upper Columbia Conference (NAD) now
using Sabbath School Action Units.
   • The number of members giving Bible studies at a church in
Michigan jumped from 3 to 30 in just a few months.
Baptisms Increase
   • Forty-four Moslem families were ready for baptism as a result of
Sabbath School Action Units in one village in the West Indonesia
Union Mission (FhD) only six months after the plan was introduced.
Baptisms tripled in Irian Jaya during the same time period.
   • In one Michigan church (NAD), there were 24 baptisms during the
first four months of the fourth year following the Action Unit plan.
Previously, this church had experienced only one or two baptisms per
year over a ten-year period. After Action Units were initiated, however,
there were 4 baptisms the first year, 16 the second year, and 27 the third
year!
Tithe and Offerings Skyrocket
   • Several churches have reported a 200 percent increase in Sabbath
School offerings, and a 200 percent increase in tithing.
   • One church in India reports a 500 percent increase in tithing!
    Would you like to see similar results in your church? Then, Sabbath
School Action Units are the answer! For more information on how to
