        OUR WONDERFUL GOD
                 Understanding Him Better

    God is the outstanding fact of the universe. Our greatest needs are
to understand Him better and to have His image restored in us. If
these needs are not fulfilled, it is impossible for us to be truly happy
or at peace with ourselves and others.
    When we become acquainted with God, we discover that He is,
indeed, wonderful. He is a God of goodness, as well as greatness. Of
love, as well as wisdom. Of mercy, as well as justice. He is the God
of the poor and meek, the wealthy and the great. He is the God of all
races, which are equally loved by Him.
    The purpose of the lessons this quarter is to help us become better
acquainted with our wonderful God and to serve Him better. We will
begin by learning what the Bible reveals about His nature and
characteristics. Other lessons will show us specifically why He is
called "wonderful" and what He has done so we can claim Him as
"ours." An overview of the entire quarterly is given below:
    Lesson 1—"Our Ancient of Days." God cannot be compared to
humankind. He is eternal, omnipresent, and without equal.
    Lesson 2—"Our Lord Most High." God is Creator and Benefac-
tor of all creation. His universal scope makes Him the perfect Judge.
    Lesson 3—"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit." The Godhead consists
of three divine Beings, unified in action but distinct in personality.
    Lesson 4—"Emmanuel—God With Us." Voluntarily, God came
 to this earth as a man to redeem what Satan had snatched away.
     Lesson 5—"The Holy One." Because of His perfection, power,
 and glory, God stands distinct—that is, holy—above all else.
     Lesson 6—"The God of Love." Nature, the Scriptures, and the
 life of Christ reveal God's love. It knows no season, geography, or
 culture. It reaches out to all unconditionally.
     Lesson 7—" The God of Peace." God provides peace to all who
 receive Christ and obey the Spirit.
     Lesson 8—"Wonderful, Counselor." Those who reach out to God
 find a hand waiting to grasp theirs.
     Lesson 9—"The Lamb of God." God offered the Lamb in a
 dramatic act of reconciliation.
     Lesson 10—"My Father and My God." God desires to be our
 dearest friend and closest companion.
     Lesson 11—"The Lord of Hosts." The angels who serve God
 unselfishly play an important role in our salvation.
     Lesson 12—"The God of Help." Because He is on our side, God
 makes His unlimited power available to protect us and guide us.
     Lesson 13—"King of Kings." The righteousness of God will
 triumph.
                                                                      5
Lesson 1                                September 26—October 2

          Our Ancient of Days




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 1 Chron. 16:24, 25; Ps. 90:1,
2, 4; 139:7-10; Isa. 44:6-8; 14:26, 27; Jer. 10:10, 11.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Look to Me, and be saved, all you ends of
     the earth! For I am God, and there is no other" (Isaiah 45:22,
     NKJV).

    KEY THOUGHT: It is important to have a clear concept of God.
It is important to know how He relates to evil and how we should
relate to Him.

   "DOES GOD HAVE A BEARD?" Four-year-old Schuyler asked
her mother.
   "Why do you want to know?" her mother wondered.
   "Because," Schuyler explained, "I don't like beards. And if God
has one, I need to get used to the idea now so I won't mind hugging
Him when I meet Him in heaven!"
   Schuyler's curiosity about God echoes both our own interest in
Him and the need to have that interest satisfied. But how can we learn
about God? We recognize that we cannot really know Him unless He
chooses to reveal Himself. So we are grateful that He has revealed
Himself in Creation, the Bible, and the life of Christ. We also have the
writings of Ellen White, often referred to as the Spirit of Prophecy, a
modern-day manifestation of God's revelation through a prophet.
Through all these sources we can become acquainted with God, whom
to know is eternal life (John 17:3).
   Knowing God lifts us out of the mire of human life. Although we
have inherited the fallen nature of Adam, we look forward to the time
when we can reflect God's character more fully.

Sunday                                            September 27
THE ETERNAL GOD (Ps. 90:1, 2, 4).

  What does Psalm 90:1, 2, 4 emphasize about God?


   In this psalm, Moses contrasts our temporary existence with the
eternity of God. Our life is limited. We come and go like the grass. We
spend our years as a tale that is told. But God abides forever.

   How do the following texts describe God?

   Rev. 11:15



   Dan. 2:44



   1 Tim. 6:13-16




   "My days are like the evening shadow; I wither away like grass.
But you, 0 Lord, sit enthroned forever; your renown endures through
all generations" (Ps. 102:11, 12, NIV).
    The eternity of God means the eternity of His righteousness and
peace. When we make the eternal God our refuge, we will never be
moved. Everything around us changes and decays. But God never
changes. When God abides with us, we can abide in Him forever.
    "I AM means an eternal presence; the past, present, and future are
alike to God. He sees the most remote events of past history, and the
far distant future with as clear a vision as we do those things that are
transpiring daily."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 1, p. 1099.

    We like and expect new things, new experiences, new ideas.
 And many of us try to retain our youthful looks as long as
 possible. Perhaps these are some of the reasons why many of us
 find it difficult to relate to the eternal God. "He is ancient," we
 seem to be saying. "How can He offer anything to help me cope
 with this fast-changing world?" Take time today to consider
 how our eternal God can change your life for the better.


                                                                     7
Monday                                        September 28
THE ONLY GOD (Isa. 44:6-8).

   Isaiah 44:6-8 describes the uniqueness of God. As you read
these verses, choose one or two phrases that highlight this unique-
ness. Why do these phrases appeal to you?


   The Bible makes it clear there is only one God—the God who
created us and who is the Supreme Ruler of heaven and earth. God's
Word emphasizes that the Lord is the only true God.

  Explain how the following texts increase our understanding of
God's uniqueness.

     Isa. 45:5, 6


     Isa. 43:10


     1 Cor. 8:6


     Ps. 86:10




   The more we learn to appreciate God's uniqueness, the more we
will appreciate His first and second commandments (Exod. 20:3, 4).
As we love God more and more, we will put away our other gods and
worship only Him.

   The SDA Bible Commentary on Isaiah 44:8 points out that the
Hebrew word translated "God" in this passage literally means
"Rock," "a common Scriptural term for God, denoting His en-
during qualities and His strength (see Deut. 32:4; 2 Sam. 22:3;
23:3; Ps. 18:2; cf. Isa. 26:4). Israel has nothing to fear with God
as their strength and defense."—Vol. 4, p. 264. In what practical
ways have you experienced God as your strength and defense?
Think of two areas in your life that God's enduring strength can
fortify. Be prepared to share one of these experiences with your
class members. Pray to God the Rock to make you strong.

THE UNIVERSAL GOD (Isa. 14:26, 27).

  How does Isaiah contrast God's greatness with our insignifi-
cance? Isa. 14:26, 27.


   When Isaiah wrote these verses, "the whole world stood in awe of
Assyrian might. But Isaiah saw the Lord as One who had 'measured
the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the
span,' before whom the 'nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are
counted as the small dust of the balance' (ch. 40:12, 15). . . .
   "Isaiah saw the hand of God stretched out in judgment against
Assyria and the other nations of his time, and knew there was no
power in heaven or earth that could turn it back. When God purposes
to do something His will shall be accomplished, regardless of the will
of man (see Num. 23:19; Job 9:12; Isa. 43:13; Dan. 4:32, 35)."
—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, pp. 172, 173.

  List three or four facts Matthew 10:29, 30 teaches us about our
universal God.


   It is comforting to know that the Supreme Ruler above is our
Friend. People everywhere are objects of His saving grace. "God is no
respecter of persons: but in every nation he that feareth him, and
worketh righteousness, is accepted with him" (Acts 10:34, 35).
   "The life of Christ established a religion in which there is no caste,
a religion by which Jew and Gentile, free and bond, are linked in a
common brotherhood, equal before God. No question of policy influ-
enced His movements. . . . That which appealed to His heart was a
soul thirsting for the waters of life."—Testimonies for the Church,
vol. 9, p. 191.

  The way Christ treated others while He lived on earth shows us that
Christianity is a religion meant to serve everyone. See Him win
Matthew the tax collector (Matt. 9:9), the Syrophoenician woman
(Mark 7:24-30), the children (Mark 10:13-16), blind Bartimaeus (Mark
10:46-52), and the Samaritan woman (John 4:4-30). How many others
can you think of? Include yourself in the list.

    Because our "God is no respecter of persons," how should we
 treat those around us, even our "enemies"? Think of at least one
 person with whom you have a less-than-ideal relationship. Ask
 God to help you develop a Christlike love for her or him.


                                                                      9
Wednesday                                       September 30
THE LIVING GOD (Jer. 10:10, 11).

  Besides His eternity and uniqueness, what other characteristic
does God have? Jer. 10:10, 11.


   These verses set forth the living God of the Hebrews in striking
contrast to the handmade gods of the heathen, which have no life. (See
1 Sam. 17:36; 1 Kings 18:26-29; 1 Thess. 1:9.) The term "living God"
means more than that God is alive. It also means that God gives life.
That is why the psalmist says: "With my whole being I thirst for God,
the living God" (Ps. 42:2, NEB; see also Ps. 63:1). The psalmist
knows that, as the parched animal drinks water and is refreshed, so we
can come to the living God and receive renewed energies. There is
also the idea of watching, caring, and acting—something a living God
could do but idols could not. We can be thankful we have a living God
whom we can trust to care for our every need.

 By what name did God reveal Himself to Moses? Exod. 3:14.
What does this name tell you about God?


   The four Hebrew letters composing this name have no related
vowels. The devout Hebrew considers the name too sacred to pro-
nounce. The name suggests that God is the ever-present, ever-active
God, the One who is ready to help when the need arises. Of Jesus,
Peter proclaimed, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God"
(Matt. 16:16, NIV). Jesus claimed that He is the Life-giver (John 6:47;
10:10), the Bread of Life (John 6:51), the Door (John 10:7, 9), and the
Shepherd (John 10:9, 14).
   "It was Christ who from the bush on Mount Horeb spoke to Moses
saying, 'I AM THAT I AM. . . . Thus shalt thou say unto the children
of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.' Ex. 3:14. This was the pledge
of Israel's deliverance. So when He came 'in the likeness of men,' He
declared Himself the I AM. The Child of Bethlehem, the meek and
lowly Saviour, is God 'manifest in the flesh,' 1 Tim. 3:16. And to us
He says: 'I AM the Good Shepherd.' I AM the living Bread,' I AM
the Way, the Truth, and the Life.' All power is given unto Me in
Heaven and in earth.' John 10:11; 6:51; 14:6; Matt. 28:18. I AM the
assurance of every promise. I AM; be not afraid.' "—The Desire of
Ages, pp. 24, 25.

    If the words of Christ are eternal life, what should I do about
 them? How do His words of life become life to me in my daily
 experiences?

THE OMNIPRESENT GOD (Ps. 139:7-10).

  What two phrases does David repeat in Psalm 139:7-10 to
emphasize God's omnipresence?


   God is everywhere. There is no place where we may flee from His
presence, nowhere that His power is not at work. By the omnipresence
of God we mean that God is not limited by space as we are. We can be
in only one place at a time. But He can be everywhere at the same
time. It is not that He spreads Himself out everywhere but that He is
wholly present everywhere. This concept is beyond our comprehen-
sion. But so is everything else about God!
   God has given us assurance in His Word that He is ever present
with us. To His followers, Jesus said, "Lo, I am with you alway, even
unto the end of the world" (Matt. 28:20). Through His prophet Isaiah,
God spoke these words of courage, "Fear thou not; for I am with thee:
be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will
help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteous-
ness" (Isa. 41:10). In the final crisis, God's people will be able to say,
"The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge"
(Ps. 46:7).

   What desire did God express in Exodus 25:8?


   The church building today has, in some ways, taken the place of the
tabernacle of Old Testament times. There the Lord meets with His
people. There we can hear His voice speaking to our hearts. God can
be to us more than mere theory. Wherever we may be, walking and
talking with Him can be a matter of personal experience. With our
spiritual ear, we personally can hear God speaking to us, telling us He
loves us and is with us, directing our ways, and speaking confidence
and joy to our hearts. When Jesus returns in glory, we can be with
those who say, "Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he
will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad
and rejoice in his salvation" (Isa. 25:9).
   In 1845, Sir John Franklin set sail to look for a passage across the
polar seas. Crew members of a whaling ship in Baffin Bay were the
last to hear from him. One of the items recovered from the shipwreck
included Franklin's Bible. He had underlined Psalm 139:9, 10.

   Recall an experience when the omnipresence of God was of
 great assurance to you. Be prepared to share that experience
 with your Sabbath School class.

                                                                      11
Friday                                                     October 2
FURTHER STUDY: David's concept of God includes the following:
"Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among
all nations. For great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised: he also is to
be feared above all gods" (1 Chron. 16:24, 25). Also read Job 38:
1-41; Psalm 19:1-6; Isaiah 40:9-31; and Education, pp. 13-19, "The
Source and Aim of True Education."

   "God so loved the world that He would not suffer it to remain
possible for it to be said that He could have given us more, or mani-
fested for the human family a greater measure of love. He knew that
the great manifestation of love, displayed in the life and death of the
Son of God, would awaken the fiercest jealousy on the part of Satan.
The gift of Christ to the world was beyond computation, and no power
could compete with God by giving a gift that would bear any compari-
son to the value of heaven's best treasure. The greatness of this gift
was to furnish men with a theme of thanksgiving and praise that would
last through time and through eternity. Having given His all in Christ,
God lays claim to the heart, mind, soul, and strength of man. Looking
upon the treasure which God has provided in the full and complete gift
of Christ, we can exclaim: 'Herein is love!--Ellen G. White, The
Youth's Instructor, "Words to the Young," Dec. 13, 1894.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. List some of the ways we can see God's greatness. The
     following texts will help you: Ps. 31:19; 92:5; 139:17;
     1 Sam. 12:24. What others can you think of? Which ways
     are most meaningful to you, and why?

   2. Define greatness by worldly standards and by God's stand-
      ards. How can we be truly great? (See John 15:1-17;
      Gal. 5:22-26; 1 Corinthians 13.)

  3. What would you say about why it is important to have a
     clear concept of God? How does He relate to evil? And how
     does He want us to relate to Him?

  4. Based on what you learned about God from this week's
     lesson, how would you describe Him to a friend who does
     not believe in Him?

SUMMARY: We serve an eternal, living God who delights in making
us the objects of His saving grace. His greatness and omnipresence
can give us strength and courage during even the most difficult situa-
tions. Nowhere else can we find such a friend.

                         A Work to Do
                           J. H. Zachary

   Vasele Lupu looked up from his hospital bed into the eyes of his
son, Benone. "It's not good news," he said quietly. "The doctor
says the cancer might have spread. But I have placed my life in
God's hands. I am ready to live or die as He wills."
   The two men prayed together in the hospital room in Bucharest,
Romania. Then Benone left. Two days later when he returned to
visit his father, he found him preparing to go home.
   "What happened?" the younger man asked. "You were so ill!"
   "I may have been dreaming," the elder man told his son. "But
after you left, I saw an intense light at the foot of my bed. A man
standing in the light told me that God had a work for me to do.
Later I asked my roommate if he had seen a bright light or heard a
voice during the night, but he had seen and heard nothing. Surely I
have been visited by an angel!"
   Lupu asked God to show him the ministry God had for him. He
began visiting the prison in Bucharest where he had spent several
years as a prisoner for his faith during Communist times. He
recognized many of the guards, and he remembered the insults that
he endured from guards and prisoners alike because of his faith.
One guard recognized him and hurled new insults at him.
   Lupu began sharing with the prisoners messages of hope in
Christ. The guard who had insulted him listened to Lupu's testi-
mony. His heart was touched, and he accepted Christ as his Sav-
iour.
   But the guard's wife was angry with his decision. "How can an
intelligent person believe there is a God?" she demanded. Then she
challenged her husband. "Do you see this plant? It has never
blossomed. If your God can make this plant bloom, then I will
believe!"
                             Later that day the woman walked into
                         the room where the barren plant sat. She
                         stared at it amazed, for the plant was bloom-
                          ing! Faith blossomed in her heart, and she
                          joined her husband to worship God and
                          later followed him in baptism.
                             Lupu thanks God for giving him a spe-
                          cial work to do.

         Our Lord Most High




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Gen. 18:25; Ps. 147:5;
Jer. 31:34; Rom. 11:33; Eph. 1:19-21; Col. 1:16, 17; Rev. 5:13.

   MEMORY TEXT: "He who dwells in the secret place of the
   Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will
   say of the Lord, 'He is my refuge and my fortress; my God, in
   Him I will trust" (Psalm 91:1, 2, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: As Creator, Judge, and Benefactor of His cre-
ated beings, God is sovereign over all the universe.

   THERE ARE MANY PHILOSOPHIES OF HISTORY. For some,
history is a random occurrence of events, without meaning or purpose.
For others, history can be explained in terms of economics and per-
sonal ambition. Still others think of history as cyclical, ever
repeating itself like a wave.
   The Christian understands by revelation that above and through all
history there is a God who began the process, sustains it, and ever
works to accomplish His plans and purposes. We are not alone to fend
for ourselves or determine our destiny.
   "To understand these things, . . . to recognize the outworking of
these principles in the manifestation of His power who `removeth
kings, and setteth up kings' (Daniel 2:21),—this is to understand the
philosophy of history.
   "In the word of God only is this clearly set forth. Here it is shown
that the strength of nations . . . is not found in their boasted greatness.
It is measured by the fidelity with which they fulfill God's
purpose."—Education, p. 175.

THE SUPREME RULER OF ALL (Rev. 5:13).

   What portion of God's creation acknowledges God as ruler of
all? Rev. 5:13.


  The Bible makes it clear that God is the one Supreme Ruler of this
world and all the universe. It is He who rules in the heavens. And it is
He who is sovereign over the earth.

   What position does David say is God's? What possessions?
1 Chron. 29:10, 11.


   These words are part of a prayer David offered when he presented
to his son Solomon the plans for a temple in Jerusalem. David had
indicated what he had prepared for the temple and what he had given.
He called upon the people also to be generous with their offerings.
This they were. Everyone was happy with the results (verse 9). This
prayer is one of the most beautiful in the Old Testament. It represents
how devout people feel when they stand in the presence of God.
Words are hardly adequate to express all the supreme qualities God
possesses.
    In contrast to God's position, David wrote that His people "are like
a shadow" (verse 15, NIV).
    We have nothing in ourselves. But in God we have everything! As
we submit ourselves to Him, He gives us a loyal heart to keep His
commandments and statutes (verse 19). Our Supreme Ruler becomes
our Supreme Benefactor if we are faithful to Him.
    "The Most High is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives
them to anyone he wishes" (Dan. 4:17, NIV). So Daniel implies that
even though much of the world is in rebellion against God, the time is
coming when the forces of evil will be overthrown and God will take
 complete control. (See Rev. 11:15.) This time is portrayed in the
 parable of the sheep and goats (Matt. 25:31-34).
    "The shaping of events seems, to a great degree, to be determined
 by [man's] power, ambition, or caprice. But in the word of God the
 curtain is drawn aside, and we behold, behind, above, and through all
 the play and counterplay of human interests and power and passions,
 the agencies of the all-merciful One, silently, patiently working out
 the counsels of His own will."—Education, p. 173.

    Though God is the Supreme Ruler of the world, why does He
 permit so much misery and injustice? How do you deal with misery
 and injustice? Be prepared to share your answer with your class.

                                                                     15

THE CREATOR OF ALL (Col. 1:16, 17).

  According to Paul, how complete is God's creation?
Col. 1:16, 17.


   Paul excludes nothing from God's creation. It includes heaven and
earth. It may or may not be visible. It may be any order of supernatural
being included under such terms as thrones or principalities. Then he
points out that Creation was accomplished through Christ and for
Him. That is, Christ is the agent of Creation and its goal. (See John
1:3.) Christ is the one in whom all things are held together. There
could hardly be any stronger statement to indicate the comprehensive-
ness of Creation and its total dependence upon Christ. Here is a
doctrine by which we can test all theories of origin, all philosophies of
existence.

  How does nature testify to its Creator? Ps. 19:1-6. What part of
Creation speaks most eloquently to you about God? Why?


   Only a Being of infinite wisdom, power, and love could have
brought the world into being. In the sunset, the snowflake, the rose,
we can see God's sense of beauty. In the mountains that tower above,
the abyss that yawns beneath, the seas that circle the globe, and the
stars in their paths through space, we can see something of God's
infinite power.
   We ourselves provide the most telling picture of the Creator. Our
wisdom and love can reflect the wisdom and love of God. Our physi-
cal form in some small way reflects something of the form of God.
Our sense of justice, mercy, and truth is a spark of God's matchless
and holy character.
   But also in us may be seen the evil image of the enemy who has
sought to destroy in us the image of God. The greatest work of the
Creator is that of restoring us to His own image. (See 1 John 3:2.)
   "Man was to bear God's image, both in outward resemblance and
in character. . . . His nature was in harmony with the will of God. . . .
He was holy and happy in bearing the image of God, and in perfect
obedience to His will."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 45.

    Some people express gratefulness to the Creator through mu-
 sic, painting, prayer, poetry, service, etc. How can you express
 gratefulness to God? Determine to express your gratefulness to
 God in some way every day.

THE INFINITE GOD (Ps. 147:5).

  In what respects may God be declared to be infinite? Ps. 147:5;
Rom. 11:33, 34.


   Since we are finite, we cannot grasp the meaning of infinity. But
we can begin to feel its magnitude when we think of all the knowledge
in the world, both past and present, and recognize that God has
comprehended it all. We bow today before the superior knowledge of
authorities in fields of learning. But God is the authority. When we
think of how narrow a field is included in the expertise of the expert
and how vast the area of possible exploration, we begin to marvel at a
God who has the expertise of innumerable experts. There is no area in
which He is not an expert. God's knowledge is infinite. And we
cannot but bow before Him in utter awe and humility.

   How does this infinite God relate to you and me? Jer. 31:3.


   "A minister remarked: When Mary and Martha sent to Jesus their
message, it was not, "'Lord, he loveth Thee,"' but, "`Lord, he whom
thou lovest is sick.'" It is not our imperfect love to Him that comforts
us, but His perfect love to us."—Encyclopedia of 7700 Illustrations,
ed. Paul Lee Tan (Rockville, Md.: Assurance Publishers, 1979), p.
496.
    However complex your problem may be, God can unravel it. How-
ever difficult you may be to understand, God can enter into the
deepest recesses of your mind and appreciate every aspect of your
thinking and feeling. There is nothing too difficult for Him. We can
commit our ways to Him with absolute confidence that He will work
everything out for our best interests.
    "If you come to God, feeling helpless and dependent, as you really
are, and in humble, trusting prayer make your wants known to Him
whose knowledge is infinite, who sees everything in creation and who
governs everything by His will and word, He can and will attend to
your cry, and will let light shine into your heart and all around you; for
through sincere prayer your soul is brought into connection with the
 mind of the Infinite. You may have no remarkable evidence at the time
 that the face of your Redeemer is bending over you in compassion and
 love, but this is even so."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3, p. 323.

   Why is the infinity of God important to you? What difference
 does this make in your everyday life?


                                                                      17

THE ALL-POWERFUL GOD (Eph. 1:19-21).

   What evidence of God's power does Paul mention in Ephesians
1:19-21?



   2.

    Note also that God manifests His power to "us-ward;" that is, in the
direction of our interests. If our all-powerful God left us to our own
devices, His power would mean nothing to us.
    Contrast how people treated Jesus with the way God treated Him.
Left to our own devices, we do not know what is for our best interest.
Religious leaders rejected Christ (see John 1:11). But God has made
Christ the means of our salvation.
    Infinitely greater than any power on earth is the power of God. He
is the Source of all power in the heavens or in the earth. The power of
the mightiest sun or the power in the smallest atom has its origin in
Him. The power in the minds and bodies of humans came from Him
and is sustained by Him.
    We witness further evidence of God's power in His Creation (Rom.
1:19, 20). As we meditate upon the infinite power of God, we stand
before Him with awe and reverence. "By his spirit he hath garnished
the heavens. . . . Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion
is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?"
(Job 26:13, 14).

   How can we receive power to accomplish our daily tasks?
Isa. 40:29-31. What special power is available to us as Christians?
Acts 1:8.


   "Worry is blind and cannot discern the future; but Jesus sees the
end from the beginning. In every difficulty He has His way prepared
to bring relief. . . .
   "Our heavenly Father has a thousand ways to provide for us of
which we know nothing. Those who accept the one principle of mak-
ing the service of God supreme, will find perplexities vanish, and a
plain path before their feet."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 481.

    If infinite power is available to us, why are we so slow to tak(
 possession of it? List at least one area of your life that conic
 benefit from God's power. Then list two things you can do t(
 accept and use His power to improve in that area.

Thursday                                              October 8
THE JUDGE OF ALL THE EARTH (Gen. 18:25).

  What did Abraham hint to God about His judgments?
Gen. 18:25.


   Abraham was concerned about the safety of Lot, his nephew, now
living in Sodom. Would God destroy a righteous man and his family
along with the wicked? It seemed unthinkable. What evidence was
there that this would not happen? The story in Genesis 18 shows
Abraham pleading with his heavenly Visitor—who was Christ—that
God would not destroy a whole city for the sake of ten righteous ones.
   The heart of a person calls for justice to be done to all, to the
righteous as well as the wicked. As it is right for the wicked to be
condemned, so it is also right for the righteous to be freed from
condemnation.
    While the Bible teaches that God is the Creator and the Supreme
Ruler of the universe, it also teaches that He is the Supreme Judge,
who will exercise His saving grace in behalf of the salvation of the
righteous and give final judgment to the wicked and rebellious.

  Who will judge the world and how? Acts 17:29-31. On what
basis will people be judged? Matt. 25:31-46.


    "Those whom Christ commends in the judgment may have known
little of theology, but they have cherished His principles. Through the
influence of the divine Spirit they have been a blessing to those about
them. Even among the heathen are those who have cherished the spirit
of kindness; before the words of life had fallen upon their ears, they
have befriended the missionaries, even ministering to them at the peril
of their own lives. Among the heathen are those who worship God
ignorantly, those to whom the light is never brought by human instru-
mentality, yet they will not perish. Though ignorant of the written law
of God, they have heard His voice speaking to them in nature, and
have done the things that the law required. Their works are evidence
that the Holy Spirit has touched their hearts, and they are recognized
as the children of God.
     "How surprised and gladdened will be the lowly among the na-
tions, and among the heathen, to hear from the lips of the Saviour,
 `Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My
 brethren, ye have done it unto Me'!"—The Desire of Ages, p. 638.

   What makes Christ supremely qualified to judge? Why are
 we not to worry about or fear His judgments?

                                                                   19
Friday                                                  October 9
FURTHER STUDY: What condition does God say will eventually
exist in the world? Jer. 31:34. Also read Isaiah 54:13 and Jeremiah
33:8. The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 35-46, "Pentecost," provides a
picture of how such a condition can be achieved.
   God has made it clear that His efforts for the restoration of this
earth from rebellion to loyalty will succeed. The iniquity of this world
will ultimately destroy it, and this world of evil will be replaced by a
new world of righteousness. Christ's sacrifice for sinners will not be
in vain. This world created by God will be restored to its original
purpose. Humankind, created in the image of God, will be morally re-
created in that image.

   "The great controversy is ended. Sin and sinners are no more. The
entire universe is clean. One pulse of harmony and gladness beats
through the vast creation. From Him who created all, flow life and
light and gladness, throughout the realms of illimitable space. From
the minutest atom to the greatest world, all things, animate and inani-
mate, in their unshadowed beauty and perfect joy, declare that God is
love."—The Great Controversy, p. 678.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. List five steps the disciples at Pentecost and their listeners
     took in accepting God and His salvation (Acts 2:1-41).

   2. What evidence do we have today of the effective ministry of
      the Spirit of God?

   3. What leads us to expect fairness in God's dealings with us?
      (See Ps. 97:2; 96:13; 103:6.)

   4. Explain the ultimate goal of our Supreme Benefactor.

   5. Describe the effect believing in God's supremacy will have
      on our lives. Provide biblical support for your thoughts.

SUMMARY: God is not dependent upon any other being for permis-
sion or guidance in order to sustain what He has created or to conquer
the terrible reign of sin. However, God chooses to use human agents
such as kings, presidents, prime ministers, governors, and other indi-
viduals as instruments by which the purposes of His grace may be
fulfilled in the earth. The Scriptures teach that both individuals and
nations are exalted through their adherence to the principles of God's
kingdom. These principles are but a natural outflowing of the nature
of God, which is love. That love brings blessing to all who allow it to
be a part of their lives, individuals and nations alike.

                    Give Me My Brother!
                          Part 1
                             K. Dkhar

    Baxstar Fanwar received an invitation to conduct evangelistic
meetings in Shillong, a large city in northeast India. He yearned to
minister in the land of his birth, where he had begun his career in
teaching and evangelism. Years ago he had accepted a call to serve
as a school principal on the tiny Caribbean island of Grenada and
later taught at Columbia Union College in Maryland.
    Teaching was his career, but evangelism was his passion. Wherever
he lived he conducted group Bible studies and successful evange-
listic meetings. But the Adventist church in Shillong had never had
notable success in evangelism; other Christian churches were too
firmly entrenched. Would it be worth the expense to go?
    As he prayed about the invitation, he gave God a list of re-
quests: "Lord, if it is Your will that I go to India, I want former
Adventists to return and believers to be stirred to evangelistic
action. I want to reach the Khasi-speaking people for You. And,
 Lord, I want my brother back in the church!"
    Fanwar had not seen his brother, Ulstar, in 20 years. Ulstar had
drifted away from the church, traveled around the world as a
 merchant marine, and married a woman who belonged to a Sun-
day-keeping denomination. Fanwar had heard that his brother had
joined his wife's church. "If You will give me these souls, Lord,
 and take care of expenses, I will gladly go."
    Almost immediately donations began arriving from unexpected
 sources. It was evident that God wanted Fanwar to go. He shared
 his goals with the church in Shillong.
    "Enlarge your vision," he challenged. "Lift up Jesus Christ and
 let Him draw men and women to Himself. Expect God to do the
 impossible. I have asked God for 100 souls!" The church was
 hopeful but could not forget that up until then they had baptized
 only a few new believers a year. "God is going to move, and we
 must be prepared!" he urged. "Rent a tent—a big tent! Act in

 shake the feeling that God had His own plans for Shillong.

Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Deut. 6:4; Matt. 28:19; 6:9;
John 1:14, 18; 2 Cor. 13:14; 1 Tim. 3:16.

   MEMORY TEXT: "Oh, the depth of the riches both of the
   wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His
   judgments and His ways past finding out! 'For who has known
   the mind of the Lord? Or who has become His counselor? Or
   who has first given to Him and it shall be repaid to him?"
   (Rom. 11:33-36, NKJV).

    KEY THOUGHT: One of the mysteries of God's being and nature
is that the Godhead consists of three divine Beings, unified in purpose
and action but distinct in personality.

   THE NATURE OF GOD IS A MYSTERY. We approach the
subject with reverence and with a recognition that in matters not
revealed we have no right to speculate.
   The oneness of God was declared in the days of Moses—"The Lord our
God is one Lord" (Deut. 6:4, KJV). Jesus quoted this and said it was the first
commandment of all. (See Mark 12:29.) The Christian faith is, therefore,
monotheistic. Yet Jesus told His disciples to baptize "in the name of the
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost" (Matt. 28:19). This indicates
there are three Persons in One. Jesus taught His disciples to address God as
"our Father" (Matt. 6:9). He Himself addressed God as His Father (John
11:41). At His baptism, the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove descended upon
Him. (See Matt. 3:16.) A voice from heaven spoke and said, "This is my
beloved Son" (verse 17). These texts and others lead us to believe that our
wonderful God is three Persons in one, a mind-boggling mystery but a truth
we accept by faith because Scripture reveals it.

THE TRUE GOD (Dent. 6:4).

  What do we learn about the nature of God in Deuteronomy 6:4?


   Down through history, people have worshiped many gods. But
there is only one Supreme Deity.
   "In striking contrast to the nations about them, who were polythe-
ists, the Hebrews believed in one true God. This profession of faith
has been the watchword of the Hebrew race for more than 3,000 years
(see Mark 12:29). The apostle Paul states the same truth as a tenet of
Christianity (1 Cor. 8:4-6; Eph. 4:4-6)."—SDA Bible Commentary,
vol. 1, p. 974.

   How does Isaiah 43 characterize the true God? Contemplate
how this is helpful to you. Fill in the blanks of each verse below. (If
you are using a version other than the NIV, you still should be able
to complete this exercise successfully.)


  Verse 1: "But now, this is what the Lord says—he who
you, 0 Jacob, he who              you, 0 Israel: 'Fear not, for I have
        you; I have called you by name; you are mine " (NIV).

  Verses 11, 12: "'I, even I, am the LORD, and apart from me there is no
                                                                        >1
        I have              and              and
(NW).
  Verse 15: "'I am the LORD, your             One, Israel's
your               "
   Nature also speaks to us of God. (See Ps. 19:1.) It tells us there is a
God who brought it into being, because it did not create itself. It also
tells us about the greatness of God, because only the true God could
have brought into being the vast universe with its galaxy of stars. Only
the true God could have designed all the aspects of nature with its
infinite detail and microscopic structure. There can be nothing better
for us than to look beyond nature to the true God and worship Him
who made the stars, the world, and everything in it.

    Sin has affected nature to the point where it can even harm us
 (tornadoes, hurricanes, monsoons, floods, etc.). Yet there is still
 much about nature that speaks to us of God. What aspect of
 nature do you find particularly helpful in this respect, and why?
 Be prepared to share your testimony with your class members.

THREE PERSONS (Matt. 28:19).

   Read Matthew 28:19. In this baptismal formula, it is notable that
the word name is in the singular, but it is followed by the three names,
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
   The word persons used in the title of today's lesson must be
understood in a theological sense. If we equate human personality
with God, we would say that three persons means three individuals.
But then we would have three Gods, or tritheism. But historic Chris-
tianity has given to the word person, when used of God, a special
meaning: a personal self-distinction, which gives distinctiveness in
the Persons of the Godhead without destroying the concept of one-
ness. This idea is not easy to grasp—or to explain! It is part of the
mystery of the Godhead.

   What hints of a Trinity does the Old Testament give us? Gen. 1:1-3.


    The Hebrew word for God in this passage is Elohim, a plural form.
Yet the verb bara, "created," is in the singular form. God speaks; that
is, He uses the Word, in Creation. (See John 1:1.) And the Spirit of
God "moved upon the face of the waters." Here there seems to be an
indication of at least more than one person. Note also the use of us and
our in this pronouncement, "Let us make man in our image" (Gen.
1:26). "The plural 'us' was regarded by the early church theologians
almost unanimously as indicitive of the the three persons of the Godhead."
—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 215.
    "There are three living persons of the heavenly trio; in the name of
these three great powers—the Father, the Son, and the Holy
Spirit—those who receive Christ by living faith are baptized, and
these powers will co-operate with the obedient subjects of heaven in
their efforts to live the new life in Christ."—Evangelism, p. 615.

   How do the following Old Testament verses suggest the concept
of the Trinity?

   Gen. 16:7-13; 48:16

   Isa 9.6

   Isa. 11:2; 42.1

    How does the concept of the Trinity help us to see how God is
 love? In what ways may we partake of this divine love and share
 it with others around us?

GOD THE FATHER (Matt. 6:9).

  How did Jesus teach His disciples to address God? Matt. 6:9.

  1.

  2.

  What description of God did Daniel receive in vision? Dan. 7:9, 10.


   Such a picture of the Father should strike one with awe. Our Father
loves us with an everlasting love. But we must ever be careful not to
be disrespectful or unduly familiar with Him.

  Who is the express image of the Father? Heb. 1:2, 3.


    When we forget that Jesus came to reveal the Father, we will begin
to misunderstand the Father. We must remember that when we see
Jesus in His sacrifice and love, we also are seeing the Father at work.
We must never separate the work of One from the work of the Other.
God is not demanding and Jesus pleading. They both demand. And
They both plead.
    "Christ came to reveal God to the world as a God of love, full of
mercy, tenderness, and compassion. The thick darkness with which
Satan had endeavored to enshroud the throne of Deity was swept away
by the world's Redeemer, and the Father was again manifest to men as
the light of life.
    "When Philip came to Jesus with the request 'Show us the Father, and
it sufficeth us,' the Saviour answered him: 'Have I been so long time
with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me
hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father?'
Christ declares Himself to be sent into the world as a representative of
the Father. In His nobility of character, in His mercy and tender pity, in
 His love and goodness, He stands before us as the embodiment of divine
 perfection, the image of the invisible God."—Testimonies for the Church,
 vol. 5, pp. 738, 739.
     The world is at enmity with God because it misunderstands Him. It
 is for us to change that conception by being God's true ambassadors,
 who reflect His character of love. (See 2 Cor. 5:17-21.)

    How do we go about telling the world that God is love? If someone
 you know has not had a good relationship with his or her father, how
 can you help that person understand God as his heavenly Father?

                                                                      25
Wednesday                                              October 14
GOD THE SON (John 1:14, 18).

   "The Word became flesh; he came to dwell among us, and we saw
his glory, such glory as befits the Father's only Son, full of grace and
truth."
   "No one has ever seen God; but God's only Son, he who is nearest
to the Father's heart, he has made him known" (John 1:14, 18, NEB).
    John wants us to be sure that in Jesus, the Son of the living God, we
recognize full Deity. He was God incarnate. (Read verses 1-4.) He
was One with the Father and existed with Him from eternity.

   Which of the following statements best describes Jesus' relation-
ship to the Holy Spirit? Check your answer by reading John 15:26.
-        The Holy Spirit goes where He sees a need. He testifies of
         Jesus.
-        The Holy Spirit is sent by Jesus to testify of Him.

   In another passage, Jesus says the Father will send the Comforter
(John 14:26). Thus there seems to be perfect collaboration between
the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This perfect cooperation
among the three Persons is to help Christ's disciples powerfully testify
of Him and spread the good news of salvation.

  Describe the relationship between the Father and the Son.
John 5:19-22.


   It is interesting to note that not only do the Father and the Son work
together, but They assume parallel functions. The Father raises the
dead. So does the Son. He gives life to whom He will. As for judg-
ment, the Father seems to have given this authority to the Son, so there
will be mutual honor. (See verse 23.) Everlasting life is dependent on
hearing what Jesus says and believing in the Father (verse 24). Both
Father and Son have life in Themselves (verse 26).
   After the resurrection, Thomas called Jesus "My Lord and my
God" (John 20:28, NIV). There was no doubt in his mind about the
deity of Christ—after he had examined Christ's scars. Jesus told
Thomas that he had been given the privilege of the direct touch in
order to help him believe. Then Jesus called those people blessed who
do not have the privilege of visual contact, yet still believe (verse 29).

       How does Jesus' relationship with the Father help us to see
    that the Father is by nature a living God? What difference does
    this make in our relationship to God?

GOD THE HOLY SPIRIT (2 Cor. 13:14, 15).

   Read 2 Corinthians 13:14, 15. This threefold benediction shows
that, in the days of the apostles, Christians understood the doctrine of
the Trinity fairly well. It was for later centuries to work out philo-
sophical and other aspects of the teaching.

   What part did the Holy Spirit have in the birth and baptism of
Jesus? Luke 1:35; 3:21, 22.


   What evidence is there that the Holy Spirit is a Person and not a mere
influence? Match the texts in column A to the items in column B.
    Column A                                         Column B
   A. 1 Tim. 4:1                       The Holy Spirit makes intercession.
   B. Rom. 8:26                        The Holy Spirit feels emotions.
   C. Rev. 22:17                       The Holy Spirit speaks.
   D. Eph. 4:30                        The Holy Spirit invites.

  What important function does the Holy Spirit serve in each of
our lives? Gal. 5:16-26.


   "Several centuries ago, the Emperor of Japan commissioned a
Japanese artist to paint a bird. Months passed, then years. Finally, the
Emperor went to the artist's studio to ask for an explanation. The artist
set a blank canvas on the easel and in fifteen minutes completed the
painting of a bird that became a masterpiece. The Emperor asked why
there had been such a long delay. The artist then . . . produced
armloads of drawings of feathers, tendons, wings, feet, claws, eyes
and beaks of birds; these he placed one by one before the Emperor.
   "The Holy Spirit operates in the life of the believer, so that we may be
conformed to the image of God's Son (Romans 8:29). This is not done in the
moment of our new birth.... It is just the beginning of the long work ... 'until
Christ be formed in you' (Galatians 4:19). Then the day shall come when the
Emperor of emperors will come for us, and the completed work will flash
forth in a moment."—Donald Grey Barnhouse, Let Me Illustrate (Grand
Rapids, Mich.: Fleming H. Revell, 1967), pp. 160, 161.

    Which fruit of the Spirit do you feel you need to grow? Pray
 that the Holy Spirit will help you to cultivate that characteristic,
 remembering all the while that the fruit describes the character of
 Christ.

                                                                            27

FURTHER STUDY: Read 1 Timothy 3:16. What about the Godhead
does this text emphasize? Also read Testimonies for the Church,
vol. 5, "The Word Made Flesh," pp. 746-749; vol. 7, "Extending the
Triumphs of the Cross," p. 29; and vol. 8, "Nature a Key to Divine
Mysteries," pp. 326, 327.

   "Great is the mystery of godliness. There are mysteries in the life of
Christ that are to be believed, even though they cannot be explained.
The finite mind cannot fathom the mystery of godliness. . . .
   "The work of redemption is called a mystery, and it is indeed the
mystery by which everlasting righteousness is brought to all who
believe. The race in consequence of sin was at enmity with God. Christ,
at an infinite cost, by a painful process, mysterious to angels as well as to
men, assumed humanity. Hiding His divinity, laying aside His glory, He
was born a babe in Bethlehem. In human flesh He lived the law of God,
that He might condemn sin in the flesh, and bear witness to heavenly
intelligences that the law was ordained to life and to ensure the happi-
ness, peace, and eternal good of all who obey. But the same infinite
sacrifice that is life to those who believe is a testimony of condemnation
to the disobedient, speaking death and not life."—Ellen G. White
Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p. 915.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. After studying this week's lesson, how would you explain
     the Godhead to an unbelieving friend? Include in your
     explanation evidence from both the Old Testament and the
     New Testament.

   2. Why is the "mystery of godliness" not a good reason for
      disbelief? What text can you use to support your answer?

SUMMARY: Have I allowed the Father to be my friend? Have I
opened my mind to the beauties of salvation through the Son? Have I
surrendered my life to the guidance and ministry of the Holy Spirit?
Have I allowed Those who provided my salvation to become the rulers
of my life?

                    Give Me My Brother!
                          Part 2
                             K. Dkhar

    Baxstar Fanwar had accepted an invitation to return to his
birthplace in northeastern India to hold evangelistic meetings. God
had opened unexpected doors to provide for his travel and the
campaign costs. But Fanwar's deepest hope and prayer was for his
brother, Ulstar, to return to the church that he had left nearly forty
years earlier. But when he arrived in Calcutta, his daughter met
him with the news that his brother soon would be ordained into a
lifetime position in the Protestant church to which he belonged.
The news shocked Fanwar, for it seemed that his deepest desire
would be denied him. But Fanwar prayed, "God, You have not
brought me this far just to see my brother lost forever. You must
stop the ordination!"
    Meanwhile, Ulstar was so wrapped up in his impending ordina-
tion that he did not even know Fanwar was in India.
    Fanwar arrived in Shillong and began preparations for the cru-
sade. In spite of church members' doubts about the success of the
meetings, they caught the vision and rallied behind the evangelist.
They pooled their meager funds and rented the largest tent they
could find; they prepared notices and sent out invitations to the
meetings; they invited their friends and relatives. And they prayed
for big results.
    God honored their faith, and the tent was filled with some five
hundred people, two-thirds of whom were not Adventists. Among
the visitors was Fanwar's brother, Ulstar. After the meeting Ulstar
spoke to his brother. "You know that I did not get the ordination."
    Fanwar nodded. "I prayed that God would stop the ordination and
call you back to His true church." As the brothers talked, Fanwar told
his brother, "I asked God for 100 souls in this crusade. But my first
goal in coming was to win you back to the truth." With tears, his
brother decided to return to the church of his childhood.
    If no one else had taken a stand during those meetings, Fanwar
still would have rejoiced. But his brother's wife and mother took
 their stand as well. Following the meetings, 88 people were bap-
 tized in a river near the church, and others continue studying. God
 gave Baxstar Fanwar his brother—and a hundred more.

  Emmanuel God With Us




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: John 1:1-3, 10, 11; 3:16, 17;
Phil. 2:9-11; 1 Tim. 3:16; Heb. 2:14, 15; Rev. 5:9.

   MEMORY TEXT: "'Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and
   bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,' which is
   translated, 'God with us" (Matthew 1:23).

   KEY THOUGHT: Entirely through Their own initiative, the Godhead
arranged for One among Them to become a human being. They did so
in order to (1) provide us with our Substitute and Surety, (2) make
God's ways plain, (3) restore us to our pre-sin perfection, and (4)
settle the debate about God's justice.

   HUMANKIND NEEDED GOD, AND GOD EARNESTLY SOUGHT
THE RETURN OF HIS WAYWARD CHILDREN. That was why He
came to earth. Without His coming, we would be eternally doomed.
   God came to earth in a vastly different form from what people
expected. Not even God's chosen people looked for the Saviour to
come in poverty and humility. They looked for greatness above good-
ness, for majesty above meekness, for power above poverty, for state-
liness above sacrifice.
   Emmanuel was God in the truest and fullest sense. He was God in
heart and God in everyday life. He was in human flesh all the love of
God and the revelation of all His goodness. This was Jesus, the son of
Mary, the Son of God—Emmanuel.
   This week, meet Jesus again as if it were the first time. Renew your
commitment to Him and let Him renew your life.

THE WORD OF GOD (John 1:1, 2).

  What three things do we learn about Jesus from John 1:1, 2?

  1.


  2.


  3.


   John's language is simple but deep. We need to study these verses
in great detail to draw out their full meaning. For instance, do you
fully understand the expression the Word? Do you see how important
the Word is? We really do not know Jesus unless we recognize His
divinity, His part in Creation, His relation to the Father, and what He
has done for humanity.
   Jesus is the Word of God. The Word is an expression of God.
Through Jesus, God expressed Himself to angels and to humans. In
Jesus we find the expression of the inmost, the dearest, the most vital,
the most enduring thoughts of God. Jesus is so completely identified
with His Father that He can be considered His Word.
   When Philip wanted Jesus to reveal the Father, Jesus answered,
"Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father" (John 14:9, NIV).
When we become acquainted with Jesus, we become acquainted with
God. If we desire to become acquainted with the love, the goodness,
the ways of God, there is no better way than to become acquainted
with Christ. He is God's very word, a perfect expression of His Father.

  How do we know that the Father and the Son are distinct
Persons? Matt. 3:17; John 20:17. What does Their distinctness, as
well as Their union, teach us?


   Because of the complete identification between God and Jesus,
between Father and Son, there are those who look upon Them as one
and the same Person. But that is not true. Jesus was a perfect expres-
sion of God. But He was a separate Person from the Father.

    Why did Philip, why would anyone, want to see the Father?
 Why do you want to see the Father? If you were in Philip's
 place, how would you have felt about Christ's response?


                                                                    31

THE WORLD'S CREATOR (John 1:3, 10, 11).

   What great doctrine of the Christian faith do we find in John 1:3?


    Christ's creation of the world was an event of outstanding impor-
tance to every human being, to all created beings.
    "It was Christ that spread the heavens, and laid the foundations of the
earth. It was His hand that hung the worlds in space, and fashioned the
flowers of the field.... It was He that filled the earth with beauty, and the
air with song. And upon all things in earth, and air, and sky, He wrote the
message of the Father's love."—The Desire of Ages, p. 20.
    "When God said to His son, 'Let us make man in our image,' Satan
was jealous of Jesus. He wished to be consulted concerning the
formation of man, and because he was not, he was filled with envy,
jealousy, and hatred. . . .
    "Until this time all heaven had been in order, harmony, and perfect
subjection to the government of God."—Early Writings, p. 145. Now,
however, the harmony of heaven was broken. Satan was cast out to
take up his abode in the newly created world, purposing to carry his
rebellion throughout the universe. He enticed humans, created in the
image of God, into disobedience. Thus they lost their innocence and
happiness and were doomed to suffer the penalty of death. God,
however, still loved them. So He created a plan whereby He could
reclaim them from sin and restore them to loyalty and holiness. Jesus
came to the world to save it.

  What do the following verses tell us about Christ, the world's
Creator?

   John 1:10:

   1 Cor. 8:6:

   Eph. 3:9:

   Describe the reception Jesus received when He came. John
1:11. Why is this still often the case? John 7:7.


  The scene is beyond understanding, almost beyond belief. Here
was something that must not be, that just could not happen. But it did.

   If Jesus knew He would be rejected, why did He come? What
 does this tell us about His feelings for us?

CHRIST AND THE FATHER (John 3:16, 17).

  What motivated Christ to come to our world in the form of
humanity? What was His purpose for coming? John 3:16, 17.


Motivation

Purpose

   The love of God portrayed in John 3:16 can be divided as follows:
   The Breadth: "God so loved the world"
   The Length: "that He gave His only begotten Son"
   The Depth: "that whosoever believeth on Him shall not perish"
   The Height: "but shall have everlasting Life."—Encyclopedia of
7,700 Illustrations, p. 496.

   In the plan for our salvation, there was complete unity between the
Father and the Son. God sent the Son. And the Son volunteered to go.
The results of this unity of purpose and effort was the death of Jesus
and the offer of eternal salvation to us.

   In John 10, what facts did Jesus present to show the close unity
that exists between Him and the Father?
verse 15
verse 17
verse 30
verse 36

    In the relationship between the Father and the Son, there is always
the closest possible unity in everything. This is true in thought and
purpose, in plan and effort.
   "Jesus is the revealer of God. In all that he says and does God is
speaking through him. If they [His listeners] have not the spiritual perception
to read the revelation in his whole conduct, if they cannot hear the divine
voice in his message, at least they ought to be able to know and understand
the 'signs' discernible in his mighty works. These tell that the Father is
in me and I am in the Father (vs. 38)."—The Interpreter's Bible (Nashville,
Tenn.: Abingdon Press, 1956), vol. 8, pp. 634, 635.

   What implications does the unity of the Father and the Son
 have for you if you are in Christ? How should this affect your
 daily life and witness?

GOD MADE FLESH (Heb. 2:14).

 What change did God the Son accept when He came into the world?
What were the results of this change? Heb. 2:14, 15; 2 Cor. 5:21.

   The change

   The results

   It is a great mystery that the God of heaven appeared on earth in the
form of human flesh (1 Tim. 3:16). The God who created the world
made the dust that composes the earth. God formed humankind of the
dust. Yet God became human when He came to earth. That mystery is
the very heart of Christianity. That mystery is also the fulfillment of
prophecy. (See Matt. 1:21-23; Isa. 7:14.)
   Human ears could not have heard a more joyful or important
message. God was to come down from heaven to earth to live as a
human. The Son of God was to become the Son of humankind so
children of earth might again become children of God (John 1:12).
Divinity became humanity in order that sinful humanity might be
accepted by God and restored to His image.
   Jesus came to earth at a time when humanity had sunk to the lowest
depths of vice and iniquity. He took on human flesh after it had been
weakened by thousands of years of wickedness. But never once was He
overcome by evil. He came both to die for us and to show us how to live
with the help of His divine power. As He was victorious against the
powers of evil, so He wanted us to know that we also could be victorious.
   "He gave His only-begotten Son to come to earth, to take the nature
of man, not only for the brief years of life, but to retain his nature in
the heavenly courts, an everlasting pledge of the faithfulness of God.
O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and love of God!
`Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that
we should be called the sons of God' (1 John 3:1)."—Selected Mes-
sages, book 1, p. 258.
   "Through faith in Christ we become members of the royal family,
heirs of God, and joint heirs with Jesus Christ. In Christ we are one."
—Selected Messages, book 1, p. 258.

   Why might it have been harder for Jesus to live on earth than
for you and me?


    Earlier, it was said that God's coming to earth as a human is
 the heart of the Christian faith. Is it the heart of your faith? If
 not, how can you make it so?

THE WORLD'S REDEEMER (Rev. 5:12).

   Of what seven things is our Redeemer worthy, and why? Rev. 5:12.


   Revelation 5:12 is the chorus of praise and victory sung by the
redeemed as they stand about the throne at Christ's final coronation.
(See The Great Controversy, p. 671.) The saints are there because
Christ has redeemed them from death. They were sinners, doomed to
eternal death. But now they enjoy eternal life and glory because Jesus
paid the price for their redemption. That price was His life and blood.
He died that they might live. He gave up all that they might inherit all.
He came from heaven in order that heaven might be theirs eternally.
He came from heaven to earth that earth itself might become heaven.
He left His position on the throne with His Father that the redeemed
might reign in glory. Now they give Jesus, crowned universal King,
the universal acclaim He deserves.

    How does 1 Peter 1:18, 19 assure us of our salvation in Christ?
How does this verse assure us of our inestimable worth? How does
it affect our sense of self-worth in Christ?


   Christ is the "Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the
world" (John 1:29). He is the provision that God had made before the
Creation of the world (1 Pet. 1:20; Rev. 13:8). This is an important
concept to consider. God is not Creator first and Redeemer second. He
did not become Redeemer after Adam had sinned. He planned for
redemption before creating humankind. It is not that we want to limit
God by a time factor. But it is important to recognize in Him an eternal
Redeemer, as well as an eternal Creator.
   Satan laid hold to the claim, "prince of this world." Jesus came to
earth to dispute that claim and to redeem us from the enemy's hold. As
He faced the cross, He said, "'Now is the hour of judgment for this
world; now shall the Prince of this world be driven out. And I shall
draw all men to myself, when I am lifted up from the earth.' This he
said to indicate the kind of death he was to die" (John 12:31-33, NEB).
   Christ's death on the cross purchased eternal life for the righteous
and ensured a just judgment for the wicked. The hour of humankind's
redemption by the blood of Christ is your great hour of destiny.

   Imagine yourself with the multitude, singing the words of
 Revelation 5:12. What do you see? How do you feel? Determine
 now, that by God's grace, you will be there!


                                                                      35
Friday                                               October 23
FURTHER STUDY: In view of what Christ has done, how should we
respond to Him? Read Philippians 2:9-11. To learn what the Lamb
will do for the victorious saints, read Revelation 7:17. Also see The
Great Controversy, pp. 666, 669-671.

   "All who have borne with Jesus the cross of sacrifice will be
sharers with Him of His glory. It was the joy of Christ in His humilia-
tion and pain that His disciples should be glorified with Him. They are
the fruit of His self-sacrifice. The outworking in them of His own
character and spirit is His reward, and will be his joy throughout
eternity. This joy they share with Him as the fruit of their labor and
sacrifice is seen in other hearts and lives. They are workers together
with Christ, and the Father will honor them as He honors His Son."
—The Desire of Ages, p. 624.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Why did God use both the words of language and the words
     of a life to help us understand what He is like?

   2. What effect does the Word of God have upon those who
      receive it and understand it? What effect does a person's
      Christian example of service have upon those who observe
      it? (Think of a person whose life in Christ has made a
      specific difference to another person. Be prepared to share
      this example with your Sabbath School class. Give as many
      details as you can without betraying a confidence.)

  3. Describe the lifestyle of those who seek to be ready for the
     Second Coming. Include in your description not only stand-
     ards but attitudes and relationships. Is one of these three
     more important than the other? Why, or why not?

  4. How did God's becoming a human help us to (1) experience
     Him as our Substitute and Surety, (2) make God's ways
     plain, (3) restore us to our pre-sin perfection, (4) settle the
     debate about God's justice?

SUMMARY: At precisely the right time and in the right way, the
three Members of the Godhead put into operation a plan They had
devised before the world was created. They surrendered a portion of
Themselves—the Divine Son—to become the Saviour of the world.
(See Gal. 4:4; I Pet. 1:18-21.) Is He your Saviour today?

     Garneita Goffar and her husband moved into their new apartment
in a large condominium complex in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Garneita
wondered how she could share her faith with her new neighbors.
     The condo community was home to many retired people. Taxis
drove up often to pick up or deliver one of the residents who did
not have a car. As Garneita watched one taxi pull away from the
curb she thought, I could offer to drive people to their appoint-
ments. She prepared a notice for the community bulletin board.
"Please give me a call if you need a ride to an appointment." She
l isted her name, apartment number, and telephone number.
     The first callers were hesitant. Was it safe to ride with a stranger—
even one who lived in the same building?
     But soon word spread that Garneita was a kind neighbor willing
to help others, and she began to get regular requests to drive to
doctor appointments, the airport, or the shopping mall. "It took
many trips in my car before my neighbors learned to trust me,"
Gameita reported.
     Finally one curious neighbor asked, "Why are you doing this?
Are you a Christian?" Garneita answered that she was, and the
rider responded with a big smile and another question. "Would you
be willing to study the Bible with me?"
     One day Garneita saw a woman struggling to move a stack of
boxes into a nearby apartment. Garneita understood the challenges
the woman faced. She greeted her new neighbor with a smile and
an offer. "Welcome to the community! I live a couple of doors
away. May I wash your windows while you are unpacking your
 things?" The surprised woman gratefully accepted her offer of
 help, and the two women spent several hours working together.
     A few days later the new neighbor commented to Garneita,
                            "You are different. Are you a Christian?"
                            When Garneita answered that she was, the
                            new neighbor asked, "Why don't we start a
                            Bible study group?"
                                Garneita praises God for opening the door
                            to a unique witness to her neighbors. She
                             requests prayers for the condo Bible studies
                             she has begun with several neighbors.

                   The Holy One




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Gen. 2:3; Exod. 15:11; 3:5;
John 17:19; Rom. 7:12; 2 Tim. 1:8, 9.

   MEMORY TEXT: "And one cried to another and said: 'Holy,
   holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of His
   glory!" (Isaiah 6:3, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: The Sovereign of the universe, by virtue of His
perfection, power, and glory, stands distinct—that is, holy—above all
else. Whatever He dwells in becomes holy, including the human heart.

    HOLY TIMES THREE. Some Bible scholars believe the threefold
repetition of the word holy in Isaiah 6:3 suggests the three Persons of the
Godhead. Be that as it may, a triple repetition of a characteristic must
mean an emphasis. This week, we shall try to discover what the holiness
of God means. It seems to be an attribute that distinguishes Him from all
other gods. It stands for a high moral perfection that sets Him apart from
all others. All three Persons are called holy—the Father (John 17:11), the
Son (Acts 4:30), and, of course, the Holy Spirit.
    God has attributes that are incommunicable, that are part of His
Godhead, such as omniscience and immortality. But holiness is an
attribute He not only communicates but desires to communicate. Thus
His people are to be a holy people. Holiness is what God is seeking for
us so He can take us into His kingdom (2 Pet. 3:14). This is a grace
that is possible only through Christ, who said that He sanctified
Himself in order that we might be holy (John 17:19). What a wonder-
ful God we worship, a Holy God, whom we have the privilege of
worshiping "in the beauty of holiness" (Ps. 29:2).

A HOLY GOD (Exod. 15:11).

   Exodus 15:11 is part of a victory song that Moses and the children of
Israel sang after they crossed the Red Sea and witnessed the destruction
of the Egyptian armies. While in Egypt, they saw many gods. They saw
these gods put to shame by the plagues that were called down because
the Egyptians would not let God's people go. But now they had wit-
nessed how God can work on behalf of His people. He not only did
wonders but He was "glorious in holiness." What does this mean?
    The key idea seems to be separateness and, as applied to God,
means that He transcends His created works. He is the Supreme Deity,
to whom nothing can be equal. To worship any other is to worship the
lesser one. That is sinful. Holiness also has a moral quality and
suggests that God is morally excellent. Finlayson says: "Since holi-
ness embraces every distinctive attribute of Godhead, it may be de-
fined as the outshining of all that God is. As the sun's rays, combining
all the colours of the spectrum, come together in the sun's shining and
blend into light, so in His self-manifestation all the attributes of God
come together and blend into holiness."—J. D. Douglas, ed., The New
Bible Dictionary (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing
Co., 1962), p. 530.

   How did the following persons address God and Jesus?

   Mary, Jesus' mother (Luke 1:49)
   Jesus (John 17:11)
   The disciples (Acts 4:30)

   How careful should we be in using God's name, and why? Exod. 20:7.


   "This commandment not only prohibits false oaths and common
swearing, but it forbids us to use the name of God in a light or careless
manner, without regard to its awful significance. By the thoughtless
mention of God in common conversation, by appeals to Him in trivial
matters, and by the frequent and thoughtless repetition of His name, we
dishonor Him. Psalm 11:9. All should meditate upon His majesty, His
purity and holiness, that the heart may be impressed with a sense of His
exalted character. . . ."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 306, 307.

    Reread Exodus 15:11. Write a "poem" that expresses praise
 for God's work in your behalf. Be sure to include in your "poem"
 the concept of God's holiness.

                                                                     39

HOLY PLACES (Exod. 3:5).

  How did Moses show reverence for the place where God ap-
peared to Him? Exod. 3:5.


   The custom Moses followed still prevails in some parts of the
world. In other parts of the world, men show reverence by removing
their hat and women by covering their heads. It is not the particular
custom that is important. It is the fact of reverence.

   How were the children of Israel to show reverence at Mount
Sinai? Exod. 19:10-13.


    God's presence can be terrifying. (See verse 18.) All nature trembles
at His presence. How much more should sinful humans enter into His
presence with holy fear.
    The sanctuary was to be a symbol of God's presence with His
people (Exod. 29:42, 43). It was to be a holy place. The garments used
by the priests were holy (Exod. 39:41). All the vessels were holy. The
altar was most holy (Exod. 40:9, 10). Wherever God is and whatever
is dedicated to the Lord is holy. In the same way, the temple was holy
(Ps. 65:4). The New Jerusalem is the Holy City (Rev. 21:2). And all
heaven is holy (Ps. 20:6).
   The Bible makes it clear that there is a difference between that
which is hallowed and that which is common. We ignore those differ-
ences at great risk to ourselves.
   "Humility and reverence should characterize the deportment of all
who come into the presence of God. In the name of Jesus we may
come before Him with confidence, but we must not approach Him
with the boldness of presumption, as though He were on a level with
ourselves."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 252.
   "To the humble, believing soul, the house of God on earth is the
gate to heaven. . . .
   "Common talking, whispering, and laughing should not be permit-
ted in the house of worship, either before or after the service. . . .
   "If when the people come into the house of worship, they have
genuine reverence for the Lord and bear in mind that they are in His
presence, there will be a sweet eloquence in silence."—Testimonies
for the Church, vol. 5, pp. 491, 492.

   Examine carefully how you behave in church. Think of two
 ways you could be more reverent. Pray that God will help you
 develop these behaviors.

A HOLY LAW (Rom. 7:12).

  What three words does the apostle Paul use to describe God's law?
Rom. 7:12. Why can the law be described in such a way? Exod. 20:1.


   We generally dislike the law of God (Rom. 8:7) because anything
that goes against our fallen natures is unpleasant to us. We want to be
free to do what we please. But if we want to be free to enjoy life, we
must learn to live in harmony with the laws of God (James 1:25; 2:12).
Only by observing the laws of harmony can a musician compose good
music. Only by observing the rules of the game can an athlete play and
win. Without law there can be only chaos and frustration.
   Jesus summed up God's holy law in Matthew 22:37-40: "'Love the
Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all
your mind.' This is the first and greatest commandment. And the
second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' All the Law and
the Prophets hang on these two commandments" (NIV). Read what
else Jesus said about the law in Matthew 5:17, 18.
   "If the law could be changed, man might have been saved without
the sacrifice of Christ. . . .The very fact that Christ bore the penalty of
man's transgression, is a mighty argument to all created intelligence
that the law is changeless; that God is righteous, merciful, and
self-denying; and that infinite justice and mercy unite in the adminis-
tration of His government."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 70.

   Those who follow God's law are pronounced "blessed" (Ps.
119:1). Discover some of the ways obeying God's holy law can be
a blessing by filling in the blanks below with the following words:
simple, reviving, eyes, joy.

   "The law of the Lord is perfect,                 the soul. The stat-
utes of the Lord are trustworthy, making wise the
The precepts of the Lord are right, giving
to the heart. The commands of the Lord are radiant, giving light to the
                  " (Ps. 19:7, 8, NIV).

    The Ten Commandments are not merely a list of "Thou shalt
 nots." Each one has a positive side. "Thou shalt not kill" means
 "Thou shalt promote life." We desire and work for the happiness
 of the people we know. (See Seventh-day Adventists Believe . . . ,
 p. 235.) Take time now to consider the other nine commandments
 (Exod. 20:2-17). What are the positive principles represented by
 each one? How could each principle improve your life and the life
 of those around you?

                                                                       41
Wednesday                                              October 28
A HOLY DAY (Gen. 2:3).

    The weekly cycle has no relationship to any phenomenon of nature,
like the day, the month, or the year. It has its origin in a holy God, who
created the world in six days and rested the seventh. God's sanctifying
it, or making it holy, set it apart for a holy use—holy communion with
a holy God.
    According to Abraham Heschel, Jewish theologian, God's presence
in time makes it holy, just as His presence in a place makes it holy. "The
reason that it matters which day one keeps as the Sabbath is that God
puts Himself in a special way, so to speak, into the hours that comprise
the Sabbath. He pauses and fills the time that runs between sunset and
sunset with a quality of presence not found in any other time period
during the week. . . . The seventh-day is the one God has set aside as a
special day for communion between heaven and earth."—Donald John,
Teaching Aids for Adult Lessons, first quarter, 1978, p. 71.

   What did Jesus say about the Sabbath and its Lord? Mark 2:27, 28.


   People have made the seventh day a day of evil omen, a day of
fasting, a day of buying and selling, or doing one's own pleasure. But
Jesus pointed out that the day "was designed to bring men into com-
munion with God."—The Desire of Ages, p. 286. Jesus showed that
bringing release from sin or disease is in harmony with the purpose of
the Sabbath. A day of mere rites and ceremonies would be wearisome,
and the whole objective of bringing good to others could be set aside
by such practices.

   What two acts of God does the Sabbath memorialize?

   Exod. 20:8-11

   Exod. 31:13 (Dent. 5:15)

   The fact that Deuteronomy gives another reason for the keeping of
the Sabbath does not negate the fact that the Sabbath is a memorial of
Creation. It points out that there may be other reasons for keeping the
Sabbath, reasons that have to do with our deliverance from sin.

   One Sabbath, Ann and David's elderly neighbors asked them to fill
a desperately needed prescription. It couldn't wait until sun-
down. What should Ann and David have done? Upon what principles
regarding the Ten Commandments in general and the Sabbath com-
mandment in particular would you base your answer?

A HOLY CALLING (2 Tim. 1:8, 9).

     Upon what two things is our "holy calling" based?

1.

2.

    "There is no alteration of life, no change of condition that implies
half so much as the alteration which Christianity introduces. It is a
kingdom of heaven begun upon earth, and by being made members of
it, we are entered into a new state of goods and evils."—William Law,
Christian Perfection (Carol Stream, Ill.: Creation House, 1975), p. 31.

  By what term does the writer to the Hebrews address his fellow
Christians? Heb. 3:1.


    Some Christians are reluctant to apply this term to themselves. This
may be because they have met Christians who have done so, yet have
lived lives that were otherwise. The fact is that the nearer we come to
the pattern Jesus has set for us, the more humble we will become. We
should not run away from this pattern. But we should be sure that the
experience we enjoy is genuine and God-given.
    The apostle Paul calls the Christians to whom he writes saints. (See
Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:2; Eph. 1:1.) The word saint is not a popular word
for Christians today. It has been used to refer to outstanding members
of a church who have been officially canonized, and thus it cannot be
applied to everyone. That is why some modern versions of the New
Testament in English avoid using the word. The word saints is
translated "his dedicated people" (Rom. 1:7, NEB), "his own people"
(Rom. 1:7, TEV), and "God's holy people" (1 Cor. 1:2, TEV).
    Paul lived a life that we may be proud to imitate. But the fact is, he
recognized he was nothing in himself (Gal. 2:20). He could glory only in
the Cross, because that was the symbol of the salvation that had been
purchased for him. It was the reason why he could be what he was
(Gal. 6:14).
    "Paul realized that his sufficiency was not in himself, but in the
 presence of the Holy Spirit, whose gracious influence filled his heart,
 bringing every thought into subjection to Christ."—The Acts of the
 Apostles, p. 251.

    How is it that some people have joined the church, keep the
 Sabbath, and yet are far from being holy in the way they treat
 other people?

                                                                      43
Friday                                                     October 30
FURTHER STUDY: Read John 17:19. In praying to His Father,
Jesus said that He sanctified Himself, consecrated Himself (NEB), or
dedicated Himself (TEV) so that His disciples may be sanctified,
consecrated, and dedicated. This is an example of total commitment.
A holy God is dedicated to the cause of having a holy people. Could
anything be more appealing to produce a response of dedication in us?
   To discover God's desire for us and why it is so important to fulfill
this desire, read Leviticus 11:44, 45; 1 Peter 1:15, 16; and Hebrews
12:14. How can we attain this desire? John 15:1-8; Philippians 4:13;
Hebrews 8:10. Also read Steps to Christ, "The Sinner's Need of Christ,"
pp. 17-22, and Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, "Blessed Are the
Pure in Heart," pp. 24-27.

    "Holiness is not rapture: it is an entire surrender of the will to God; it
is living by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God; it is doing
the will of our heavenly Father; it is trusting God in trial, in darkness as
well as in the light; it is walking by faith and not by sight; it is relying on
God with unquestioning confidence, and resting in His love."
—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 51.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. List the reasons why God declares certain places or certain
     times (like the Sabbath) holy.

   2. The worshipers at the wilderness sanctuary or at the temple
      in Jerusalem knew when God was present because of the
      brightness of His glory, called the Shekinah. Can we today
      determine whether and when God is present? If so, how?
      Does the dedication of a place of worship make it holy? Or
      is it also necessary for God to be present? Explain.

   3. What can we do to recognize the Sabbath as distinctive with-
      out making its observance a burden as the Pharisees did?
      Base your answers on the guiding principles of God's laws.

   4. A friend believes you are legalistic because you observe the
      Sabbath. Based on what you learned from this week's les-
      son, how would you respond?

SUMMARY: It was not natural for a holy God to take on human
nature as Christ did. It is not natural for us to become partakers of the
divine nature as we may. But the redemption of a sinful world re-
quired God to take this step. Your own personal redemption requires
that you take your step. Will you choose to remove all barriers today
and allow Christ's power and grace to lead you to holiness?

                  Face to Face With Death
                           Marec Smalek

    When a young Polish man named Mark was inducted into the
Polish military, he was assigned to the paratrooper school. While
on a training mission thousands of feet above the ground, he
moved toward the plane's door, ready to jump when his com-
mander gave the signal. When he saw the signal to jump, he
pushed himself away from the plane and yanked on his parachute
cord. But another paratrooper had jumped at nearly the same in-
stant. Both men's parachutes opened at the same time. The chutes
became entangled and failed to open completely.
    The two men desperately struggled to separate their parachutes
as they plummeted toward earth. In an instant Mark sensed that he
was facing death and he was not prepared. He had no idea what lay
beyond the grave. After what seemed like an eternity, the men
were able to separate their parachutes. They opened their emer-
gency chutes in time to slow their plunge to earth and allow for a
safe landing.
    Dazed, but without any broken bones, Mark could not shake the
thought that he had just faced death. But he was not ready to die.
During the remainder of that day, thoughts of death haunted him,
and the question, What happens to me when I die, played over and
over in his mind.
    That evening he turned on his radio, hoping to get his mind off
his close call. As he searched the shortwave dial for a station
broadcasting in Polish, he found Adventist World Radio's Polish
 Voice of Hope. He listened in stunned silence, unable to believe his
ears. The speaker's topic was what happens when you die.
    Mark felt that it had to be more than coincidence that he had
tuned in to this particular program that answered his deepest ques-
tions just when he needed it. He became a regular listener and
requested a Bible correspondence course. He completed the course
and began attending the Seventh-day Adventist Church. In time he
was baptized.
     Mark thanks God for saving him from death and leading him to
 that radio program that in turn led him to a Christ-filled life. Now
 Mark and his wife share with others how up-to-date God's ancient
 truths are.
    Pray for people around the world who are finding their way to
 Jesus through the ministry of radio.

   Marec Smalek is director of the Voice of Hope in Poland.

               The God of Love




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ps. 103:2-4; Hos. 11:8; Matt.
22:36-40; John 3:16; Rom. 5:7, 8; 1 John 4:16.

   MEMORY TEXT: "Beloved, let us love one another, for love
   is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows
   God. He who does not love does not know God, for God is love"
   (1 John 4:7, 8, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: God's love for humankind, revealed in nature
and the Scriptures and demonstrated perfectly in His Son's life, knows
no limits of season, geography, or culture. It reaches out to all.

   LOVE IS A FLAME THAT WARMS, a light that glows, a
magnet that draws, a fragrance that refreshes, a cup that cheers, a
mountain that endures, a smile that reveals.
   When you see love, you know it. When you experience it, you
recognize it. When you lack it, you need it and want it.
   When you experience the new birth of conversion, you experience
a new birth of love—toward God and toward all the world about you.
   "God is the source of life and light and joy to the universe. Like
rays of light from the sun, like the streams of water bursting from a
living spring, blessings flow out from Him to all His creatures. . . .
   "When the love of Christ is enshrined in the heart, like sweet
fragrance it cannot be hidden. Its holy influence will be felt by all with
whom we come in contact. . . .
   "Love to Jesus will be manifested in a desire to work as He worked,
for the blessing and uplifting of humanity. It will lead to love,
tenderness, and sympathy toward all the creatures of our heavenly
Father's care."—Steps to Christ, pp. 77, 78.

Sunday                                                 November 1
GOD IS LOVE (1 John 4:16).

  If there were only one word to describe God, what would that
word be? 1 John 4:16.


   Love is the very nature of God. Everything He does is prompted by
love. We may see His love in all His works. His wondrous love is
revealed in the things of the world about us and in the infinite ex-
panses of the heavens above. If we would see love, we must see God.
No one can see love without seeing God! Those who feel the touch of
God feel the touch of love.
   Because human vision is limited, we do not always see love in the
ways of God. Children do not always perceive their parents' love in
deeds of the greatest wisdom and most tender concern. The more fully
our eyes are opened and the more comprehensive our understanding
becomes, the more clearly we are able to see that God, indeed, is love.
   Were it not for a God of love, there would be no world and no one
to inhabit it. Were not God a Being of love, He would not be the
embodiment of infinite wisdom and power. God's power exerts itself
always, and only, in love. God's wisdom shows itself in constant
outpourings of love to make us truly happy.
   Love is personal. It must have someone to love, someone with
whom to share. Unless it can expend itself in deeds of honest concern
for the welfare of others, it is not happy, and it is not love. Love craves
love and creates love. The more it manifests itself, the wider will be
the circle of happiness and love.

  What two words describe the Christian's relationship to God's love?
Eph. 3:17. What effect will such a relationship have on our lives?

   1.

   2.

   Effect:

   All of our highest attributes are due to love, and therefore due to
God. Unselfishness, truthfulness, sympathy, justice, goodness, and
mercy all come from love and cannot exist without it. These attributes
find their fullest expression in God. He is "merciful and gracious,
longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth" (Exod. 34:6, KJV).

   Describe what life would be like without love. What impact
 has God's love had on your life?

                                                                       47
Monday                                                November 2
GOD'S LAW OF LOVE (Matt. 22:36-40).

   What was Jesus' summary of the Ten Commandments and the
teaching of Scripture? Matt. 22:36-40.


    "Our duty to obey [God's] law is to be the burden of this last
message of mercy to the world. God's law is not a new thing. It is not
holiness created, but holiness made known. It is a code of principles
expressing mercy, goodness, and love. It presents to fallen humanity
the character of God, and states plainly the whole duty of man."
—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, pp.
1104, 1105.
    There can be no greater law than love. Love embraces every duty
we have—to God and to those in the world about us. If we have
supreme love for God, we will do all that God commands. If we love
others, we will do nothing against their best interests.
    In heaven, the law of angels is the law of love. They need no other
law, for their every thought and deed is always, and only, love. With
us, however, that is not the case. The details of right and wrong in our
relationships with God and others need to be set before us in more
specific detail. That is why God gave us His Ten Commandments, the
first four pointing out our love and duties to God and the last six, our
love and duties to others.
    "Man's natural tendency is to make self first, irrespective of
obligations incumbent upon him in his relations to God and to his fellow
men. To be completely selfless in dealing with his fellows, a man must
first love God supremely. This is the very foundation of all right con-
duct."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 484.
    The saving acts of God in our lives form the basis of our relationship
to God (Deut. 6:5; Exod. 20:2). God brought Israel out of Egypt with a
mighty arm, and so the Israelites were to recognize Him as the one true
God. They were to remember His acts of Creation (Exod. 20:11) and
deliverance (Deut. 5:15). They would be moved to respond in love.
    You and I have experienced God's love in our lives. Thus, we are
moved to thank Him and to love Him. When God instructed Moses to
tell Israel, "Ye shall be holy: for I the Lord your God am holy" (Lev.
19:2), one of the specifications was, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself" (verse 18). Love was as important in the days of Moses as it
was at the time of Christ. It was ever the basis of God's law as it is
ever the foundation of God's eternal throne.

   How do we show we love God? John 14:15; 1 John 5:2, 3. How
 can Christians have both love and hate in their heart? Ps. 97:10;
 Amos 5:15.

Tuesday                                             November 3
GOD'S LOVE TOWARD SINNERS (Rom. 5:7, 8).

  How do we know God takes His love for us seriously? Rom. 5:7, 8.


   God has shown His love in untold ways—in His works of Creation
and preservation, in bringing into existence holy beings who are to be
eternally happy, in maintaining an endless universe by boundless
wisdom and love. But God's greatest demonstration of love was the
love He showed toward sinners who were in rebellion against Him.
"For when we were still without strength, in due time Christ died for
the ungodly" (Rom. 5:6, NKJV).
   Sinners need love. But they do not deserve it. What they deserve is
death. But it is from death that God purposes to save them. Only love
could have prompted that purpose. Justice demanded that sinners
should die. But God's love provided a substitute.
   God loves not only good people but bad people; not only one
person but all persons. God loves people who do not love Him. He
loves people who reject His love and spurn His mercy, who love sin
rather than righteousness, and who choose ways of death rather than
ways of life. God loves people who despise and reject His Son, who
came to save them. He loves them even though they would put His
Son to death on a cruel cross, demanding death for the Prince of Life
but mercy for a servant of the prince of evil.

   Because of God's great love, of what may we be confident? Rom.
8:38, 39. What about Paul's life qualified him to write these verses?


   Paul lists a number of elements that might be strong and that we
think might prevent God from reaching us with His love. But Paul
holds these elements up to ridicule. Not one of them is more powerful
than God. Not one of them can be considered an obstacle to God's
saving grace.
   It took just such love to save us. Nothing less would have worked.
Unless God had been willing to give up His Son for sinners, they
could not have been saved. Unless Jesus would have given up His
throne and His life for sinners, they would have perished in their
iniquity. "We, like the rest, lay under the dreadful judgement of God.
But God, rich in mercy, for the great love he bore us, brought us to life
with Christ" (Eph. 2:3, 4, NEB).

   What about your life qualifies you to believe the way Paul
 does? How can the Holy Spirit help you in your daily life to
 share in Paul's vibrant life of faith?

                                                                     49
Wednesday                                            November 4
GOD'S LOVINGKINDNESS (Ps. 103:2-4).

    Read Psalm 103:2-4. The word translated "lovingkindness" has
been translated in a number of different ways: "mercy," "kindness,"
and "goodness" in the KJV. The RSV translates it "steadfast love."
Two related ideas are "covenant" and "faithfulness." (Compare SDA
Bible Commentary, vol. 3, pp. 719, 720.) The thought of the psalmist
seems to be that God has given a covenant to His people and has been
faithful to it, and this relationship can be considered as honorable and
glorious as the wearing of a crown.
    God's ways are ways of incomparable kindness. His gifts are those of
the most tender love. No parents ever displayed greater love for their
child than does God for His children. Where God is, there His loving-
kindness is revealed and His goodness and mercy are displayed.
   Wherever we find loveliness and harmony, grandeur and virtue, it
is because of God's goodness and love. If only the eyes of our spiritual
vision were opened, we would everywhere see evidences of God's
tender, all-pervading, never-failing love. We would see God's love in
rain as well as sunshine, in the clouds above and the grass beneath.

   What is the basis of true happiness? Ps. 144:15.


   "God's love is revealed in all His dealings with His people; and
with clear, unclouded eyes, in adversity, in sickness, in disappoint-
ment, and in trial we are to behold the light of His glory in the face of
Christ and trust to His guiding hand. But too often we grieve His heart
by our unbelief. . . ."—My Life Today, p. 12.
   "God is neither capricious nor petty, neither remote nor repressive;
but a God of holiness and love, of wisdom and power. The God of the
Bible is greater than any man's experience of him, far greater than
human powers of expression; but while far above us in majesty and
might, he cares for us, deals with us individually, and grants to those
who trust him fullness of life. He is the God of light and truth, of
strength and beauty and peace. Not only did he create, but he is ever
active, working in infinite patience and with endless resources. Happy
are the people who acknowledge such a God, wait for him, live with
him, obey him in thought and speech and deed. His peace is in their
hearts, his liberty and joy in their minds, his omnipotence at their
disposal."—The Interpreter's Bible, vol. 4, p. 739.

   What special blessings come to those whose relationship with
 God is right? Ps. 103:1, 3, 5. What is the greatest blessing you
 have received from God, and why?

Thursday                                               November 5
GOD'S UNIVERSAL LOVE (John 3:16).

  In the verse below, circle the two words that tell us God's love is
universal.


   "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that
whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life" (John
3:16, NIV).
   God's love is like an artesian well. We do not have to sink a shaft
hoping to strike water. We do not need a bucket or a pump to bring the
water up. It flows freely. It cannot be stopped. The symbolism of
water in the Bible portrays the picture of God's generous, refreshing,
life-giving, ever-flowing, never-failing love. (See Ps. 1:3; Isa. 12:3;
John 4:14; Rev. 22:17.)

   Christ's perfect love enabled Him to love even His enemies.
Why are we to do the same? Matt. 5:43-48. How is it possible to
love our enemies when it seems so impossible?


   We usually discriminate in our love. But that is not true of God and
must not be true of those who claim to be Christians. The Christian
standard of relationship to other people is that of God, who distributes
His gifts bountifully without regard to worthiness or response. The main
criterion is that of need. The good and the bad alike need sunshine and
rain, and God supplies them impartially. Does my enemy need my
witness? If so, then it is my responsibility, as a Christian, to reach out a
helping hand and do what God would do if He were in my place.
    Everything, animate or inanimate, constantly experiences the care
of God (see Matt. 10:29-31; 6:26-31). "The Lord is good to all: and his
tender mercies are over all his works" (Ps. 145:9). "The eyes of all
wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season. Thou
openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing"
(verses 15, 16). "The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to
all that call upon him in truth" (verse 18).
    God sent Israel into Canaan with the charge "Be strong and of a good
courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the Lord thy God, he it is that
doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee" (Deut. 31:6).
Has God helped to transform an enemy to a friend by His love? If yes,
what valuable lessons have you learned from this experience?

    How has God displayed His universal love to you, even in
 difficult times? Now think of ways you can share God's univer-
 sal love with someone you consider to be your enemy.

                                                                         51
Friday                                                 November 6
FURTHER STUDY: What is God's attitude toward people who are
unworthy of His love? Hosea 11:8. Admah and Zebolim are two cities
of the plains that were destroyed with Sodom and Gomorrah. (See
Gen. 14:2; 19:25, 29.) Fire and brimstone rained down from heaven
(Gen. 19:24) and the "smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a
furnace" (verse 28). There comes a time when God must punish evil.
But it is not a pleasant task for a God of love. To learn more of God's
attitude toward the sinner, read Ezekiel 18:31, 32; 33:11. Also read
The Desire of Ages, "The Divine Shepherd," pp. 476-484.

   "All the paternal love which has come down from generation to
generation through the channel of human hearts, all the springs of
tenderness which have opened in the souls of men, are but as a tiny rill
to the boundless ocean when compared with the infinite, exhaustless
love of God. . . . You may study that love for ages; yet you can never
fully comprehend the length and the breadth, the depth and height, of
the love of God in giving His Son to die for the world. Eternity itself
can never fully reveal it." Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 740.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. In Sabbath and Thursday's lessons, there are figures of
     speech describing God's love ("love is a flame that warms"
     or "love is a cup that cheers,"etc.). Based on what you have
     learned from this week's lesson and from your own experi-
     ence, write two or three original figures of speech to de-
     scribe God's love.

   2. Define love by writing out some of its aspects. For example, love is
      a self-forgetting concern for the well-being of others. Then apply
      these definitions to God. Do they still fit? For example, how has
      God shown self-forgetting concern for others? For you?

   3. A family in your church has learned that one of its members
      has terminal cancer or AIDS. Based on what you have
      studied this week, how do you react toward them?

   4. In Matthew 5:47, after telling us to love our enemies, Jesus
      says, "'Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is
      perfect' (verse 48, NIV). What is the standard of this per-
      fection and why? 1 Cor. 13:4-7.

SUMMARY: Do you marvel that God could do so much for so many
who are so ungrateful? Will you just now let Him lead you to this river
of gracious love, where you may drink from these waters of life, never
to thirst again?

                          A Child Shall Lead
                             Charlotte Ishkanian

        Ten-year-old Eglute Ratkute is a quiet, intense girl who lives in
    Kaunas, Lithuania. When she learned about Jesus Christ, she wanted
    to follow Him. In doing so, she led her mother to Christ as well.
        Shortly after Communism fell in Lithuania, Eglute's mother
    heard about some Bible lectures and decided to go. Eglute wanted
    to go, too, but she was just seven years old then, and her mother
    wondered if she could sit still through the meetings.
        As they entered the lecture hall, Eglute's mother noticed that no
    other children were present. She worried that Eglute would be
    bored, but the little girl was fascinated with the slides of the
    ancient city of Petra and listened carefully to the lecture. After the
    meeting a lady invited Eglute to the special children's meetings,
    but Eglute wanted to attend the adult meetings.
         Eglute attended all the lectures with her mother. She heard the
    speaker explain the importance of following Christ. When he
    asked who wanted to follow Jesus, Eglute raised her hand. When
    the speaker presented the topic of baptism, Eglute again raised her
    hand; she wanted to obey Jesus and be baptized.
         Later at home Eglute told her mother she wanted to follow
     Jesus and be baptized. When Mother told her that seven years old
     is too young to be baptized, Eglute began to cry. Mother tried to
     console her, but Eglute could not be persuaded to wait.
         Eglute's mother talked to the pastor about her child's wish to be
     baptized. He agreed that probably she was a little young, but he
     asked Mother, "Have you considered baptism?" Eglute's mother
     shook her head; she had not seriously considered it.
         Later at home, Eglute began to talk to her mother about follow-
     ing Jesus. "You really should do what Jesus says," Eglute would
     urge her mother. Mother's heart was touched, and she decided to
                              follow Christ in baptism. Eglute joined her
                              mother in the baptismal class. She studied
                              the doctrines, and a few months later mother
                              and daughter were baptized together.
                                  Eglute is now 10 years old. After attend-
                               ing adult Sabbath School for a year, she was
                               persuaded to join the children's Sabbath
                               School, where she happily takes part.

              The God of Peace




Sabbath Afternoon

READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ps. 119:165; Matt. 10:34;
Gal. 5:22, 23; Phil. 4:6, 7; Col. 1:19-22; Heb. 12:14.

   MEMORY TEXT: "The work of righteousness will be peace,
   and the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance for-
   ever. My people will dwell in a peaceful habitation, in secure
   dwellings, and in quiet resting places" (Isaiah 32:17, 18, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Our God has provided that each one who re-
ceives Christ and obeys the Spirit will experience a peace and content-
ment beyond imagination.

   GOD MAKES NO STATEMENTS THAT ARE NOT TRUE.
Nor does He make promises He does not keep. What He says concern-
ing the relationship between righteousness and peace is altogether
true, and what He promises His people is altogether certain.
   It is the very nature of righteousness to bring peace to those who are
righteous and the end of inner strife to all who accept righteousness. It is
true now in this world, and it will be true in the new earth forever.
   Since the saints look forward to a new world of righteousness in
harmony with God's Word, they can look forward with certainty to a
heaven of peace in accord with His promises. The people of God are
those who have permitted peace to replace strife here in their own
hearts and lives. For this reason, the land they will inherit forever will
consist of sure dwellings for all, with quiet resting places.
   This week, learn about the relationship that exists between peace
and righteousness, plus some of the results of allowing God's
righteousness to be manifested in our lives.

PEACE FROM JESUS (Col. 1:19-22).

  In what state of being do we exist before we accept Christ?
After we accept Him? Col. 1:19-22; Rom. 5:1.

  Before
  After

   "When peace enters the human soul, it will enter by that door [the
gospel]. A young woman, whose letter tells its own story, wrote: 'I
haven't found Christ's way smooth. Perhaps because I had chosen so
long to walk my own. Until one day quite unexpectedly I caught sight
of His; and my plans for the future faded before the blaze of one great
certainty: whatever the cost, I must follow Him. It meant fighting
through years that I had pledged to work against Him. It meant losing
one job after another, and one friend after another. But I couldn't turn
back. I found in him a measure of life so strong, so joyous, and so
unafraid that I had to keep on. He has come to mean not a dusty figure
of ancient history, but a living, vibrant Presence; and the throbbing
grandeur of the steady purposes of God.'
   "There is a peace which is of this world—a spurious peace at the
last. And a peace that this world cannot give. 'My peace."
—The Interpreter's Bible, vol. 8, p. 341.

   What is the nature of the peace that comes to the Christian
through Christ? What will it do? Phil. 4:6, 7.


   Jesus tells us that His sense of security, His peace, rested not on the
circumstances in which He found Himself, not even on His being able
to understand the meaning of those circumstances, but in absolute,
unwavering confidence in His Father (John 14:27-31). He knew that
the Father would permit nothing to come into His experience that was
not a part of Their plan.

    God instructed Aaron and his sons to bless the Israelites with
 the following words:
    "The Lord bless you
         and keep you;
    the Lord make his face shine upon you
         and be gracious to you;
    the Lord turn his face toward you
         and give you peace" (Num. 6:24-26, NIV).
    How long has it been since you claimed this blessing?

                                                                      57

PEACE AND HOLINESS (Heb. 12:14).

   If we are to see God, how should we relate to others? Heb. 12:14.


    That such a command exists suggests it is not an easy one to follow.
It requires a goal we are to pursue with effort, giving no heed to
obstacles.
    We should note that relating thusly toward others means more than
the absence of war or trouble. It means we deal justly with others, that
we are no longer motivated by jealousy, greed, or hatred but by God's
great love shining in our hearts.

   How do we achieve such a relationship with others? Isa. 26:3.


   "In his autobiography, Robert Louis Stevenson tells of a day in his
childhood when he accidentally locked himself in a dark room. He could
not turn the key to release himself, and he was in terror by reason of
imagined enemies, until his father came to the door and called to him.
Then he became quiet. In a little while the music of his father's voice
made him forget his surroundings and his terrors. And he actually en-
joyed the remaining time of his imprisonment before the coming of the
locksmith. So we may bear terrors, difficulties, dangers—every unto-
ward thing—as we remember that God is with us, Who speaks reassur-
ingly.—F. S. Corbett." J. Gilchrist Lawson, ed., Greatest Thoughts
About God (New York: George H. Doran Company, 1920), p. 282.

   What other attribute must go along with peace, and why? Heb.
12:14. How can we "pursue" such attributes as this text indicates?


   Peace is very closely connected to holiness, and holiness is closely
connected with God. It is not a matter of peace at any price! The
Christian must pursue the goal of peace only in ways compatible with
Christian principles. Genuine peace is a matter of the heart and spirit.
   Peace within produces happiness. God's people are a happy people
because they are a peaceful people. Heaven will be a place of happi-
ness because it is a place of peace. "The meek shall inherit the earth;
and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace" (Ps. 37:11).

    Is there someone with whom you are not at peace? A family
 member perhaps? Or a co-worker? Pray that the music of your
 Father's voice will bring peace to your heart and your relation-
 ships with others.

PEACE AND THE LAW OF GOD (Ps. 119:165).

  Describe the connection between the law and peace among
people. Ps. 119:165.


   God designed His law to preserve a close and happy fellowship
between Himself and all created beings. If we violate any of its first
four precepts, there will be conflict between us and God. If we violate
any of the last six commandments, there will be conflict not only
between us and others but also between us and God. Loving obedience
to God's will brings forth His peace in our hearts.
   Consider Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Neither peer pres-
sure, mob psychology, loss of position, nor safety from physical pain
and death could influence them to waver in the least from their
allegiance to an unseen God!
   Let us sense the "calm contentment with which they stood their
ground in face of Nebuchadnezzar's ultimatum—`if ye worship not,
ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery
furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?'
Their reply (Dan. 3:16-18) is classic: '0 Nebuchadnezzar, we are not
careful to answer thee in this matter.' (No panic!) `If it be so, our God
whom we serve is able to deliver us . . . and he will deliver us out of
thine hand, 0 king.' (Courteous, but unanswerable—they knew their
God!) 'But if not'—if no deliverance comes—'be it known unto thee,
0 king, that we will not serve thy gods.' (It doesn't matter! It makes
no difference! Live or die, they are content.)"—J. I. Packer, Knowing
 God (Downers Grove, Ill.: Intervarsity Press, 1975), pp. 26, 27. "Great
 peace have they which love thy law" (Ps. 119:165, KJV).

  What is the source of fightings and wars? James 4:1-3. How
does being "a friend of the world" fit into this picture? See verse 4.


   War erupted in heaven because Lucifer violated the very first
principle of the law in his attempt to set his throne above the throne of
God. Because Adam and Eve disobeyed, Eden was deprived of peace,
and humankind was robbed of the tranquility and happiness God had
placed in its soul. Sin brought unrest.
   Heaven will be the eternal home of all happiness and peace, be-
cause all who abide there have God's law of peace written in their
hearts, and they live it out in their lives.

   Have you had a difficult time viewing the Ten Command-
 ments as a source of God's peace? Review how each command
 can be a source of peace in your life.

PEACE—A FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT (Gal. 5:22, 23).

   What is the only way we can have peace in our hearts? Gal.
5:22, 23; Rom. 8:6.


    Although the natural heart is against God, against right, against
peace, it need not remain so. God has provided a remedy. He has sent
His Holy Spirit into the world to convict us of sin and give us strength
to overcome. Instead of the works of flesh (Gal. 5:19-21), we are to
enjoy the fruit of the Spirit. In place of hatred, discord, wrath, and
strife, the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, and peace.
    Sometimes peace floods over the Christian in a dramatic way. Dr.
R. A. Torrey, founder of the Bible Institute of Los Angeles, and his
wife passed through a period of severe trial when their 12-year-old
daughter died. Their hearts were leaden; their grief keen. Even the
weather added its gloom on the day of the funeral. Rain was their
companion as the little coffin was lowered into the ground.
    The next day Dr. Torrey felt a renewed surge of grief as he thought
of their loneliness in the years ahead, the emptiness of their house, and
the many changes their daughter's death would introduce into their
lives. With tearing heartache, he looked to the Lord for help. He wrote
of that moment:
    "And just then this fountain, the Holy Spirit, that I had in my heart,
broke forth with such power as I think I had never experienced before,
and it was the most joyful moment I had ever known in my life! Oh, how
wonderful is the joy of the Holy Ghost! It is an unspeakably glorious
thing to have your joy not in things about you, not even in your most
dearly loved friends, but to have within you a fountain ever springing up,
springing up, springing up, always springing up three hundred and sixty-
five days in every year, springing up under all circumstances unto
everlasting life!"—Quoted by Ray C. Stedman, Secrets of the Spirit (Old
Tappan, N.J.: Fleming W. Revell Co., 1975), p. 120.
    "The mighty power of the Holy Spirit works an entire transformation
in the character of the human agent, making him a new creature in Christ
Jesus. . . . The peace that dwells in the soul is seen on the countenance.
The words and actions express the love of the Saviour. There is no
striving for the highest place. Self is renounced. The name of Jesus is
written on all that is said and done."—Ellen G. White Comments,
SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1117.

    In what area of your life do you particularly need to experience
 the indwelling of the Holy Spirit and His peace? Look to the Lord
 for help and experience the transforming power of His Holy Spirit.

PEACE AND THE SWORD (Matt. 10:34).

   How can you harmonize Christ's promise of peace with His
statement in Matthew 10:34?


   The parallel scripture, Luke 12:51, reads: "Do you think that I have
come to give peace on earth? No, I tell you, but rather division" (RSV).
The verses following—in both Gospels—clearly reveal how those who
follow their Master will suffer ostracism, how those who are closest to
them will become their most stubborn enemies. God and mammon, light
and darkness, righteousness and sin have nothing in common. Christ's
sword is His Word of truth. Those who abide in His Word are separated
from those who reject His Word, as a sword cleaves the flesh.
   "It was the mission of Jesus to reconcile men to God, and thus to one
another. But the world at large are under the control of Satan, Christ's
bitterest foe. The gospel presents to them principles of life which are
wholly at variance with their habits and desires, and they rise in rebellion
against it. . . . It is in this sense—because the exalted truths it brings
occasion hatred and strife—that the gospel is called a sword."
—The Great Controversy, p. 47.

   What danger does the Christian face? But what victory assures
us of final peace? 1 Pet. 5:8; Rev. 12:7-21.

   Danger
   Victory

   Christ's word about the sword had a sure, early, and sad fulfillment.
His own disciples were to experience it. John the Baptist had already
fallen. Stephen was soon to fall. Peter and John in prison (Acts 4:1-3),
the apostles in the common jail (Acts 5:18), the scattering of the church
before the persecuting Saul (Acts 8:1-3; 9:1, 2), the vexed church at the
hands of Herod, and the death of James (Acts 12:1, 2), the numerous
persecutions of Paul (2 Cor. 11:23-26), and the banishment of John to
Patmos (Rev. 1:9)—all point to the certainty that the forces of evil will
make war against the teaching of righteousness. In the last days, God's
people will experience those forces again (Rev. 12:17).

    "And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory
 in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself
 restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast" (1 Pet.
5:10, NIV). Pray to God for the strength and steadfastness to
 withstand your "most stubborn enemies."

                                                                        61
Friday                                            November 13
FURTHER STUDY: To learn how we can enjoy inward peace de-
spite outward turmoil and strife, read Philippians 4:6, 7. For images of
the peace we can experience as Christians, review Psalm 23. What
images of peace in this psalm are the most meaningful to you, and
why? Why not try writing your own psalm of peace? Also read
Christ's Object Lessons, "To Meet the Bridegroom," pp. 419-421.

   "Those who take Christ at His word, and surrender their souls to
His keeping, their lives to His ordering, will find peace and quietude.
Nothing of the world can make them sad when Jesus makes them glad
by His presence. In perfect acquiescence there is perfect rest."—The
Desire of Ages, p. 331.


 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Which comes first, peace or the keeping of the law? Will
     people who keep the law possess peace because they are free
     of guilt? Or will people naturally keep the law when they
     are at peace with the One who governs them?

   2. What is the relationship between righteousness and peace?
      (Ps. 85:10-13). What are some of the results of accepting
      God's righteousness?

   3. Your next-door neighbor was laid off three months ago
      from a high-paying job he had held for several years. Now
      the bank is threatening to foreclose on his mortgage. One
      day, he asks you how you seem to stay so calm in the face of
      adversity. How do you respond based on what you have
      studied this week about the God of peace?

SUMMARY: When the angels announced the birth of Jesus, they
sang of peace. God was freely providing His grace and mercy for all
who would accept them, bringing forgiveness of sin through the Sav-
iour of the world. Scripture reveals that Christians may experience
peace with God and the peace of God. The first means the end of
God's wrath against the sinner; the second, the tranquility that floods
the mind with the assurance that one is reconciled with God. It is not
enough to say that God through His Son brought peace to this earth or
that peace is a euphoric substance that can be injected into the human
experience. Rather, peace becomes ours when we receive Jesus Christ,
for He is our peace. (See Eph. 2:11-18.)

                   A Priest's Long Search
                            J. H. Zachary

    A priest stepped inside the Adventist church in Milasauti, Ro-
mania. The woman cleaning the church welcomed him then contin-
ued her work while the priest sat down and meditated. Later, when
the woman returned to the sanctuary, she was surprised to hear
someone playing the organ in the balcony and went to investigate.
She found the priest playing an Adventist hymn from memory,
singing along with all his heart.
    How was it that an Orthodox priest knew this Adventist hymn?
the woman wondered. But she did not ask. Before leaving the
church, the priest asked directions to the Adventist church in Radauti,
a city near his monastery.
    A few days later Pastor Benone Lupu of the Radauti Adventist
Church watched as the same priest entered the churchyard. Lupu
greeted him. "May I see inside your church?" the priest asked.
Pastor Lupu smiled and showed him the way.
    The priest was deeply impressed by the church, especially the
children's Sabbath School rooms. The two men began talking.
When it grew dark, Pastor Lupu invited his guest to stay the night.
The two talked until long past midnight.
    The priest told Pastor Lupu that during his teens he had some-
times attended an Adventist church. But when his father learned of
his visits, he beat the boy brutally and even chained him to a post
so he could not go to the church. Once the man threw him into a
well, intending to drown him, but the neighbors saw what had
happened and rescued the teenager. Finally, to make peace with his
 father, the teen agreed to enter a monastery and become a priest.
 But he had no peace. Now, seven years later, he saw the Adventist
 church and stopped to visit.
    A few weeks later, while gathering alms from the people to help
 finance the monastery, this priest saw another Adventist church.
 He decided to attend church that Sabbath. He did not want to go in
 his clerical robes, so he used some of the alms he had collected to
 buy civilian clothes. He packed his robes in a box and sent them to
 the monastery with a note. "I have found Jesus in the Adventist
 church. Please forgive me, Father, for leaving you."
    This former priest found Christ and the peace, joy, and fellow-
 ship he needed in the Adventist church. Would he have found them
 in your church?

Hour in Redlands, California.

Lesson 8                                         November 14-20

       Wonderful, Counselor




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Prov. 3:1, 2; Eccl. 12:13;
Isa. 40:13, 14; Jer. 31:3; 2 Tim. 1:2; 2:7; Rev. 3:18.

  MEMORY TEXT: "And His name will be called Wonderful,
  Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace"
  (Isaiah 9:6, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Because of His love for His children, God
offers beneficial counsel to all who look to Him.

   GOD AS COUNSELOR IS THE THEME OF THIS WEEK'S
LESSON. Good counsel is always important, whether from another
person or from God. Counsel from God is always good. In this world,
we owe much of our happiness and success to counsel that comes from
others. Misery and mistakes are all too frequently the result of our
failure to accept counsel, both human and divine. We always hurt
ourselves when we neglect to heed counsel from God.
   The Word of God consists largely of counsel the Lord has given. It
is always the best counsel we can receive, because it is designed to
give us happiness, prosperity, and peace here and an eternity of bliss
in the world beyond. Only to a slight extent have we come to recog-
nize the wisdom and worth of the heavenly counsel found in the Word
of God. Giving heed to injunctions will expand our intellect, give
health to our body, and purify our soul.

COUNSEL OF WISDOM (Isa. 40:13, 14).

  What is unique about God's wisdom and knowledge?


   With whom could the Creator of the world, the One infinite in
power, wisdom, and knowledge, have taken counsel when He brought
the world into being? He alone knows and understands all. Only He
can teach all others but has no one who can instruct Him. Only He can
give unerring counsel to all but has none to direct His ways.

   What contrast does Solomon make between the person who
seeks counsel and the person who does not? Prov. 12:15.

   The person who seeks counsel is

   The person who does not seek counsel is a

   Accepting God's counsel of wisdom and counsel of love is like
taking God by the hand. Without these counsels, we are no different
from the wicked, who grope along in deep darkness, knowing not
what they are stumbling over.
   "I bless the Lord who gives me counsel," wrote the psalmist; then,
addressing his Benefactor: "Thou dost show me the path of life"
(Ps. 16:7, 11, RSV). There is One who knows the way, and we may
safely trust our footsteps to Him.

   How does the psalmist describe people who follow God's coun-
sel? Ps. 25:9.


   God being the embodiment of wisdom, all His counsel is wise. And
God being the embodiment of love, all His counsel is good. It is wisdom
for us to listen to counsel of wisdom. He might have kept His wisdom to
Himself. But had He done so, He would not have been God, for love
called for the sharing of His wisdom and counsel with those in need.
   "Let God teach you His way. Inquire of Him daily to know His will.
He will give unerring counsel to all who seek Him with a sincere heart."
—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 9, p. 276.

    What area of your life are you having problems with? Your
 marriage? Your relationship with a friend or co-worker? Nega-
 tive emotions such as anger, pride, or jealousy? What helpful
 counsel does the Bible give concerning this area? How can this
 counsel improve your life?

                                                                    65

COUNSEL OF LOVE (Jer. 31:3).

   How does God draw us to Himself, and what does this reveal to
us about what He is like? Jer. 31:3.


   True love does not forget. It always seeks to help, never to hurt.
One of the best ways in which love can show itself is by giving
counsel. Gifts of counsel are often of greater value than any other
gifts. They cannot be measured in terms of material value, although at
times they are of the highest material value. Heavenly counsel pro-
vides us with the greatest values we can obtain in life.
   Counsel from people is not always prompted by love and is not
always wise. People may give counsel to others that they would not
want for themselves. Counsel from people may be for the purpose of
benefiting the giver rather than the receiver.
   But God's counsel is always prompted by love and is always
helpful and wise. Accepted, God's counsel may seem to hurt at the
time, but its fruitage is always good.
   Those whom God loves, He rebukes and disciplines (Rev. 3:19).
Jesus at times administered counsel in terms of stern rebuke. But when
He did, it was prompted by love. "He did not censure human weak-
ness. He spoke the truth, but always in love. He denounced hypocrisy,
unbelief, and iniquity; but tears were in His voice as He uttered His
scathing rebukes."—Steps to Christ, p. 12.
   As persons and situations differ, so counsel varies. What is good
counsel for one may prove to be poor counsel for others. When people
follow counsel intended for others in entirely different circumstances,
the results they reap may be ill instead of good. But God must not be
blamed for people's lack of judgment or discernment.

   What counsel did Jesus give to a rich young ruler? Matt. 19:21.


   "God does not require us to give up anything that it is for our best
interest to retain. In all that He does, He has the well-being of His
children in view. Would that all who have not chosen Christ might
realize that He has something vastly better to offer them than they are
seeking for themselves. Man is doing the greatest injury and injustice
to his own soul when he thinks and acts contrary to the will of God."
—Steps to Christ, p. 46.

   Why are we sometimes reluctant to accept good counsel? If
 you had the choice of receiving money or good counsel, which
 would you choose, and why?

COUNSEL TO A MINISTER (2 Tim. 1:2; 2:7).

   What counsel did Paul give Timothy? 1 Tim. 1:2; 2:7; 4:12,15,16.


   Although Paul's words were directed to Timothy, they are of value
to all who aspire to be God's helping hand.
   Timothy was a young minister with his future before him. In his
work, he might be merely mediocre. He might be a failure. Or he
might be an outstanding success. Paul loved Timothy as his own son
and gave him the best counsel he could so he might be successful.
   "This epistle was written to Timothy while he was pastor of the
Ephesian church, and is composed primarily of instructions addressed
to him as a leader of the church. . . . In it Paul admonishes Timothy to
conduct himself in a manner pleasing to God and helpful to the flock
over which God has placed him, and delivers to him a solemn charge
to preach the Word and to defend its teachings."—SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 7, p. 285.
   "Paul urged Timothy to meditate upon those things that are pure and
excellent, that his profiting might appear unto all. The same counsel is
greatly needed by men of the present age. I urge upon our workers the
necessity of purity in every thought, every act. We have an individual
accountability to God, an individual work which no one else can do for
us. It is to strive to make the world better. While we should cultivate
sociability, let it not be merely for amusement but for a higher purpose.
   "Is there not enough taking place around us to show the need for
this caution? Everywhere are seen wrecks of humanity, broken-down
 family altars, ruined homes."—Gospel Workers, p. 125.

   What truth did Paul note to encourage Timothy to be fearless?
2 Tim. 1:7, 8.


   When one is on the side of right, on the side of God, there is no
reason to fear. Note how Jesus was unafraid in the storm and before
the two demoniacs. (See Matt. 8:23-34.)
   "The inference may be drawn from this epistle that Timothy was a
man of mild temperament and not so aggressive as Paul might have
wished. Accordingly the apostle encourages his younger companion
in the ministry to more vigorous leadership."—SDA Bible Commen-
tary, vol. 7, p. 285.

    Read 2 Timothy 2:1, 2, 16, 19, 22-25; 3:14, 15; 4:2, 5; and
 indicate the ways in which this counsel is relevant to you today.

HEAVEN'S COUNSEL FOR ALL (Eccles. 12:13).

  Explain why it is important to fear God. Eccles. 12:13. Why is
our first duty to God and not ourselves?


   No better counsel can be given than to make first things first. True
religion requires an ordering of priorities. Eternity is at stake. If we
lose heaven, we lose everything. If we do not find God in this world
and fail to live in accord with His ways, we not only lose the finest and
best that this life can offer but eternal life, as well.

  What counsel do we read in Matthew 6:25-33 regarding our
daily needs?


   "God's law is the law of love. He has surrounded you with beauty
to teach you that you are not placed on earth merely to delve for self,
to dig and build, to toil and spin, but to make life bright and joyous
and beautiful with the love of Christ—like the flowers, to gladden
other lives by the ministry of love. . . .
   "Lead the children to see in every pleasant and beautiful thing an
expression of God's love for them. Recommend your religion to them
by its pleasantness."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 97.
   The present world of sin is doomed to pay the wages of sin, which
is destruction. Evil people are simply destroying themselves and the
world in which they live.
    When we forget God and His commandments, we forget the only
force that can hold the world together, the only means by which peace,
happiness, and well-being can be preserved and life itself maintained.
   We need to learn that there is a God in heaven and that we owe
allegiance to Him—an allegiance we can neglect only at the expense
of our present well-being and eternal happiness. When we do neglect
our allegiance to the Lord, we neglect ourselves and others and the
world in which we live. The price for such negligence is a life on earth
without God's goodness and love and the loss of life in heaven.

   What is Micah's summary of God's requirements? Mic. 6:8.


   Is there a person you know who walks humbly with God and
treats others with mercy (kindness) and justice? How has that
person made a difference in your life? Pray for God to help you
meet these requirements.

COUNSEL FOR LAST-DAY PEOPLE (Rev. 3:18).

  What special counsel does Revelation 3:18 give to the Laodicean
church?


   We do not need to be rich in this world's goods. But we do need to
have spiritual riches. The symbolism of gold, white raiment, and eye
salve may be interpreted as follows: gold—faith that works by love;
white raiment—Christ's righteousness; eye salve—the ability, through
the Spirit of God, to distinguish between truth and error.

   Why is it necessary for us to be on guard at all times? Matt. 25:13.


    God has given many details concerning the kind of people the
saints should be in order to be ready for His coming. Some character-
istics are as follows:
    Sober (1 Thess. 5:6). The daytime is a time to work, not to sleep.
(See John 9:4.)
    Diligent (2 Pet. 1:10, 11). Although we are called and chosen, we
must never cease to be careful lest we fall.
    Obedient (Rev. 22:14). An alternate reading gives "wash their
robes." We need to have the robe of Christ's righteousness to enter the
kingdom.
    Confident (Heb. 10:35). There may be periods of waiting and
uncertainty. But our faith must remain firm.
    Patient (Heb. 10:36, 37). Christ's coming is as certain as day
following night. Wait for it!
    Overcoming (Rev. 2:7). The Christian is a faithful warrior for
Christ. Victory is assured.

   Now look up the following texts to find others:
   1 Pet. 5:8
   2 Pet. 3:11, 14
   1 John 3:3
   Rev. 21:27
   Rev. 3:14

    Why is it more difficult, or less so, to be holy in the last days
 than in earlier times? In what practical ways can God help you
 to grow in holiness?

                                                                    69

FURTHER STUDY: To learn about the blessing of heeding God's
counsel, read Proverbs 3 and Deuteronomy 28. Also read Thoughts
From the Mount of Blessing, pp. 147-152.

   "Had the Israelites obeyed the instruction they received, and prof-
ited by their advantages, they would have been the world's
object-lesson of health and prosperity. If as a people they had lived
according to God's plan, they would have been preserved from the
diseases that afflicted other nations. Above any other people they
would have possessed physical strength and vigor of intellect. They
would have been the mightiest nation on the earth."—The Ministry of
Healing, p. 283.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  I. What are the present-day sources of divine counsel and
     guidance? How do these sources relate to each other?

   2. The principal source of God's counsel is the Bible (Ps. 119:105).
      In what areas of life is the Bible an especially important
      counselor?

   3. Why should God's remnant people search both the Bible
      and Spirit of Prophecy writings? Why is there need for
      additional counsel in the last days?

   4. If you were to give your pastor counsel for the carrying out of
      the work in your congregation, what would that counsel be?

   5. What do submission, surrender, and humility have to do
      with the effectiveness of divine counsel to leaders and church
      members?

SUMMARY: God is not silent. He speaks. What He says benefits His
creation. Although Adam and Eve walked away from Him in dis-
obedience and rebellion, God did not remain silent. He has kept in
touch.
    The extent to which our wonderful God has kept in touch is truly
amazing. He might have simply revealed His keen disappointment over
our first parents' lack of trust. But He did more. He came calling for them
in the Garden. He might have simply told them how He was going to put
an end to Satan's escapades. But He did more. He promised the guilty
pair full restoration. He might have simply told them to look for a better
tomorrow. But He did more. He helped them and their descendants live
good lives today. God has always been interested in the total welfare of
His people. He is a wonderful Counselor.

               God's Persistent Call, Part 1
                        Mihalet Dogaborh

    Josef had recently finished school and started a new job in
Budapest, Hungary. With time on his hands, he began looking for
new friends and interesting things to do. He became involved with
some young people who worshiped Satan. They taught him how to
call up demons, and he soon won their respect, for he seemed to
have great psychic power.
    The young people spent their time smoking marijuana, drink-
ing, and listening to hard rock music. Josef bought a motorcycle so
he could ride with his friends. But a serious accident nearly cost
him his life when a piece of flying debris cut a long gash in his
neck, and he nearly bled to death. The doctor who cared for him
told him he was lucky to be alive. "You should have died beside
the road," he told Josef solemnly. But Josef paid little attention.
He did not believe in God.
    Just weeks after his near-fatal accident, Josef was again riding
his motorcycle. Then one day as he sped down a road, he lost
control and hit a pole, tearing his motorcycle apart and throwing
him into a ditch. But he climbed out of the ditch with barely a
scratch. His friends began calling him Lucky, but Josef began to
think that maybe something—or Someone—had saved his life.
But why? Was God trying to tell him something?
    Josef knew nothing about religion; he felt he needed to learn if
God exists and what God wanted from him. He had no idea which
church to attend, so he looked up a friend who was a Christian.
Josef talked to him about religion and began attending church and
studying the Bible with him.
    The devil was not willing to let Josef go without a struggle. One
night Josef awoke feeling as though a heavy weight had been laid
across his chest. He tried to get out of bed, but he could not move.
 It was as if a mighty hand was holding him down. The experience
 frightened him, and when he told his girlfriend, she became fright-
 ened too. "You must pray to God—and keep studying the Bible!"
 she urged. She found an enrollment card for a Bible correspon-
 dence course and gave it to Josef. He sent for the course and began
 studying it.
                                               (continued next week)

              The Lamb of God




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Exod. 34:5-7; Isa. 53:5, 6;
Rom. 3:28, 5:1; Phil. 2:5-8; 1 Thess. 5:23.

   MEMORY TEXT: "The next day John saw Jesus coming to-
   ward him, and said, 'Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away
   the sin of the world!" (John 1:29, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: When confronted with Adam and Eve's rebel-
lion, God provided a means of reconciliation that proves His love for
each sinner even though He abhors sin.

   JESUS CAME TO EARTH AS A SINLESS LAMB to take on
Himself the guilt of a sinful world. He came knowing that He would
die but knowing also that we would live. Today heaven is ours be-
cause Jesus was willing to give up heaven. I am a child of God
because Jesus became the Son of man.
   "Satan in heaven had hated Christ for His position in the courts of
God. He hated Him the more when he himself was dethroned. He
hated Him who pledged Himself to redeem a race of sinners. Yet into
the world where Satan claimed dominion God permitted His Son to
come, a helpless babe, subject to the weakness of humanity. He
permitted Him to meet life's peril in common with every human soul,
to fight the battle as every child of humanity must fight it, at the risk of
failure and eternal loss."—The Desire of Ages, p. 49.
   To test the acoustics in Agricultural Hall, London, Charles Spurgeon
shouted into the empty auditorium, "Behold, the Lamb of God which
taketh away the sin of the world!" A worker in the ceiling heard, knelt
before God, and received salvation. Won't you kneel before God this
week and receive salvation anew?

GOD'S THOUGHTS TOWARD SINNERS (John 1:29).

   What does God want to do for us? John 1:29.


   Leviticus 4 deals with the case of a person who had sinned "through
ignorance against any of the commandments of the Lord concerning
things which ought not to be done" (verse 2). Four categories of
sinners are mentioned: priest, congregation, ruler, and common per-
son. Those who had a greater knowledge of the law were required to
bring a more expensive sacrifice, but the poor man was not left out.
   "A lamb was even less expensive than a goat, and for this reason it
was expected that a poor man would bring a lamb. The lamb was
therefore considered the poor man's offering. It is significant that Christ
is repeatedly spoken of as the Lamb of God. He is the poor man's
sacrifice."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 732.
    A lamb also was significant in a Hebrew's mind as an animal slain
for the Passover. This commemorated Israel's deliverance from slav-
ery in Egypt and also pointed forward to their deliverance from the
slavery of sin through the sacrificial death of the Messiah to come.
    What thoughts must have raced through the minds of the
congregation at the Jordan River when John the Baptist referred to
Jesus as "the Lamb of God"! Although no one knew it, there before
them stood the very Man who some three years later would perish as a
sacrifice for the sins of the world. Did any truly understand?
    What thoughts must have raced through Jesus' mind as He heard
those words! He knew that all those prophetic words implied a Gethsemane,
a Calvary. He was to be the sin offering for a lost humanity.

   Explain how God views sinners. Ps. 103:8-14; Jer. 29:11.


   God looks on us, not as we are, but as we should be, might be, and
will be, when redeemed from sin and rescued from its deadly grip.
   "Can you believe that when the poor sinner longs to return, longs to
forsake his sins, the Lord sternly withholds him from coming to His
feet in repentance? Away with such thoughts! . ..We must not think of
God only as a judge ready to pronounce sentence against us. He hates
sin; but from love to sinners He gave Himself, in the person of Christ,
that all who would might be saved and have eternal blessedness in the
kingdom of glory."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 633.

   What thoughts race through your mind as you hear the call
 "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the
 world"? Before you stands the Son of God!

                                                                       73
Monday                                             November 23
GOD'S MERCY TOWARD SINNERS (Exod. 34:5-7).

   How did God reveal Himself to Moses? Exod. 34:6, 7.


    God's justice demands that the transgressor pay the penalty of
transgression. Death is that penalty. So if justice alone were to prevail,
all of us would die, for all of us have sinned. God, however, is
merciful. His mercy makes it possible for the condemned sinner to
live. God, in Jesus, paid the penalty for all who repent of their sins and
accept Jesus as their Substitute. God's mercy is great. But His justice
is real. If we refuse to accept the provisions made for our salvation,
then we will have to face full justice.

   What truth points out the mercy of God? Rom. 5:8.


   Let us suppose that the richest and most generous person on earth
set up a trust fund with the simple provision that any person who
wrote and asked could have $10,000. Would that multibillionnaire
watch to see how many took advantage of the offer? Would that
person be interested in knowing why some had not gotten the word
and why, when they had heard, they did nothing about it?
   God the Father and God the Son watch eagerly to see who will
accept Their gift of mercy. Some have never gotten the word. Some
who have heard pay little attention. As Satan tries to snatch the gift
away from many, God lovingly, anxiously presses His gift upon those
who will accept it. To coerce them to do what is right would be to play
into the hands of Satan, who claims that God forces obedience. God's
loving approach is to urge sinners to turn from their evil ways, allow-
ing them to be attracted to Him and to respond in turn by love. This
kind of love is hard for us to understand. We have never seen anything
like it. So God has to reassure us that He is not out to destroy us. He
said through Jeremiah: "I know the plans I have for you, says the
Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a
hope" (Jer. 29:11, RSV).
   "Theme for the most profound meditation! The matchless love of
God for a world that did not love Him! The thought has a subduing
power upon the soul and brings the mind into captivity to the will of
God."—Steps to Christ, p. 15.

  Take a few moments to meditate on "the matchless love of
God for a world that did not love Him!" As you do so, put
yourself in the picture. You are part of that world. How much do
you love Him? And how will you express that love?

HEAVEN'S SACRIFICE FOR SINNERS (Phil. 2:5-8).

  Through what twofold sacrifice did God reveal His love for us?
Phil. 2:5-8.


   "Now our whole souls are filled with one thought—the condescen-
sion of God. . .. As we assign no limit to the height of his glory, we shall
assign none to the depths of his grace. . . . So far from taking offence at
the inferiority of the position which he assumed, the very lowliness of his
incarnation and the very degradation of the death he died, will kindle in
us a brighter and more burning gratitude, when we remember that though
rich it was for our sakes he became poor; and that for us, his wayward
and wandering sheep, the chief Shepherd offered up himself as the Lamb
of God, laying down his life of his own accord, and taking it up again to
die no more."—Edward H. Bickersteth, The Trinity (Grand Rapids,
Mich.: Kregel Publications, 1959), p. 92.

  Why do you think God asked Abraham to sacrifice his son?
Gen. 22:1-13. What did Jesus say about this experience that caused
some people to be angry? John 8:56-58.


   Some ,have been called upon to make the sacrifice of a son or
daughter to die for their country. It is not an easy experience. Some
parents would rather die and have their children live. But the supreme
sacrifice becomes the measure of supreme love and devotion.
   For the Son "this was a voluntary sacrifice. Jesus might have
remained at the Father's side. He might have retained the glory of
heaven and the homage of the angels. But He chose to give back the
scepter into the Father's hands, and to step down from the throne of
the universe, that He might bring light to the benighted, and life to the
perishing."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 22, 23.
   Before Jesus came to earth, He knew what suffering, humiliation,
and shame it would bring. He knew that He would be despised and
rejected; insulted, spat upon, treated as the vilest of criminals, and die
upon the cross. But He was willing to pay the price.
   The sacrifice made by Christ is likened to that of an innocent lamb
placed upon an altar. Until Christ came in person to offer Himself
upon the cross, the system of sacrifices kept ever before the repentant
sinners the high price their salvation would cost. What a price it was:
the very life of God!

    Are you willing to respond to God in the same way He responds
 to you? What are you willing to sacrifice for Him?

                                                                        75

OUR SINS ON THE LAMB OF GOD (Isa. 53:5, 6).

   How are we healed of the gaping wound caused by our sins?
Isa. 53:5, 6.


   "All that He endured—the blood drops that flowed from His head,
His hands, His feet, the agony that racked His frame, and the unutterable
anguish that filled His soul at the hiding of His Father's
face—speaks to each child of humanity, declaring, It is for thee that the
Son of God consents to bear this burden of guilt; for thee He spoils the
domain of death, and opens the gates of Paradise. He who stilled the
angry waves and walked the foam-capped billows, who made devils
tremble and disease flee, who opened blind eyes and called forth the
dead to life—offers Himself upon the cross as a sacrifice, and this from
love to thee. He, the Sin Bearer, endures the wrath of divine justice, and
for thy sake becomes sin itself."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 755, 756.

   List the results of Christ's sacrifice. 1 Pet. 2:24. Consider the
relationship between dying to sin and living for righteousness in
the context of Christ's great sacrifice for us.
   1.
   2.

   While dying on the cross, Christ agonized "My God, my God, why
have you forsaken me?" (Matt. 27:46, NIV). The sins of the ages
resting on Christ caused separation between Him and His Father, and
He died for sin.
   "The Saviour could not see through the portals of the tomb. Hope did
not present to Him His coming forth from the grave a conqueror, or tell
Him of the Father's acceptance of the sacrifice. He feared that sin was so
offensive to God that Their separation was to be eternal. Christ felt the
anguish which the sinner will feel when mercy shall no longer plead for
the guilty race. It was the sense of sin, bringing the Father's wrath upon
Him as man's substitute, that made the cup He drank so bitter, and
broke the heart of the Son of God."—The Desire of Ages,
p. 753.

    At times, we all feel forsaken by God. How does the cry of
 Christ recorded in Matthew 27:46 help you to work through
 those times? Remember that He was forsaken for your sake that
 you may never be forsaken for His sake.

Thursday                                          November 26
THE GOD WHO JUSTIFIES (Rom. 3:28; 5:1).

  What must we have to be justified? Rom. 3:28; 5:1.


   Sinners are not at peace with God but at enmity. Sin fights against
God, rebels against conformity to His law and His will. Death is the
penalty for sin. Christ came into the world, however, to rescue us from
that death penalty and to restore us to peace with God. He offers love
for enmity, pardon for condemnation, reconciliation for alienation.
    All this is what is meant by justification. God accepts us not
because of what we have done for God but because of what God has
done for us in Christ. Justification is accomplished the moment we
accept salvation by faith in Christ. It changes our standing before the
court of heaven. Our sins are pardoned. We are accepted as members
of the heavenly family, in peaceful and happy relationship with God.
   "God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that
the world through him might be saved" (John 3:17, KJV). Justification
is the opposite of condemnation. Christ's purpose was to justify, not
condemn.
    We are "justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is
in Christ Jesus" (Rom. 3:24), not "by the works of the law, but by the
faith of Jesus Christ" (Gal. 2:16). Sinners are justified by Christ
immediately when they accept Him by faith—there is no waiting until
sainthood has been achieved.
    "We have no righteousness of our own with which to meet the
claims of the law of God. But Christ has made a way of escape for us.
 He lived on earth amid trials and temptations such as we have to meet.
 He lived a sinless life. He died for us, and now He offers to take our
sins and give us His righteousness. If you give yourself to Him, and
 accept Him as your Saviour, then, sinful as your life may have been,
 for His sake you are accounted righteous. Christ's character stands in
 place of your character, and you are accepted before God just as if you
 had not sinned.
    "More than this, Christ changes the heart. He abides in your heart
 by faith. You are to maintain this connection with Christ by faith and
 the continual surrender of your will to Him."—Steps to Christ, p. 62.

    Put your name in the blank that appears in the verse below:

   "Being justified by faith,                  [has) peace
 with God through our Lord Jesus Christ" (Rom. 5:1).

   What does "peace with God" mean to you? What experience
 can you share to describe it?

                                                                    77

FURTHER STUDY: Not only is our God a God who justifies; He sancti-
fies, as well. What do the following verses teach us about this process?
Acts 26:18; John 17:17; 1 Cor. 1:30; 1 Thess. 5:23; Ezek. 11:18-20; Gal.
5:16-25. Also read Steps to Christ, "Growing Up Into Christ," pp. 67-75.
   Justified means I am cleansed from the guilt of sin, and I walk free
from its penalty; sanctified means I am strengthened by the Holy
Spirit to resist the power of sin.
   The effect of sin is to destroy the image of God in us. The effect of
the gospel is to restore us to God's image. The purposes of Christ in
coming to the world were to reveal God's character to us, to die for
our sins, and to make it possible by His grace that His character be
reproduced in us. If we are to live eternally in a holy heaven with a
holy God, we must accept and manifest His gift of holiness. (See Heb.
12:14.) The transformation from sinfulness to holiness flows from our
Saviour's righteousness. It is the holy law of God being written on the
hearts of the saved.

   "One day alone is ours, and during this day we are to live for God,
beautify our characters by faith in the righteousness of Christ. This one
day we are to place in the hands of Christ in solemn service, in all our
purposes and plans to be guided by Him. This one day we are to do unto
others exactly as we wish them to do unto us. We are to be ready to speak
kind words from hearts full of sympathy and love. We are to manifest
patience, revealing to the world what it means to be a practical doer of
the words of Christ, ever remembering that our life is bound up with the
life of Him who died for us. Christ and the child of humanity become
one, so that the Spirit and character of Christ are represented in His
followers day by day and hour by hour. By faith Christ becomes unto
the believer righteousness, sanctification, and redemption."
—Ellen G. White, "By Their Fruits Ye Shall Know Them," Signs of the
Times, July 11, 1892; italics supplied.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Why was Christ fully qualified to be our Sin-bearer?

   2. Which was a harder experience to bear, the Father giving the
      Son, or the Son offering Himself for our salvation? Why?


SUMMARY: May this consecration prayer be your heart's desire:
   O Lamb of God, You freely chose to take away the sins of the
world. I accept Your perfect sacrifice as a full atonement for all my
sins. I plead Your abiding presence for power to obey. You are my
strength, my everlasting helper. Our Father has made You my right-
eousness and wisdom, my sanctification and redemption. Amen.

                        Mihalet Dogaborh

    While he was a member of a group that worshiped Satan, Josef
was involved in two serious motorcycle accidents. His miraculous
escape from death forced him to wonder if God was trying to tell
him something. But the devil was not willing to let go and tried to
frighten Josef into giving up his search for God. But the devil's
plan only drove Josef to seek God more intensely.
    Josef spent his free time reading his Bible and studying the
Bible correspondence course he had sent for. One day he found the
passage in Exodus that commanded God's people to remember the
Sabbath day. He wondered, How is it that the Bible commands
God's people to keep the Sabbath, but Christians worship on
Sunday?
    When he found no one who had an answer, he asked God to
send him the answer. A few days later he received the next lesson
in the Bible study course. It was on the Sabbath. He recognized
this lesson was God's answer to his prayer, and he decided he
would keep the Sabbath holy—even if he had to keep it alone.
    Then he received the Bible lesson that spoke of Jesus' soon
return. This was another surprise for him. Josef wanted to talk to
someone who could help him understand these new teachings. He
wrote a letter to the Bible correspondence school, asking if they
knew someone in his area who could answer his questions.
    A pastor telephoned Josef and arranged to meet him at the train
station. Josef waited at the appointed spot, but no one came.
Finally a man walked up to him and asked, "Are you Josef?" Josef
nodded. The pastor explained that Josef did not look the way the
pastor had pictured him in his mind, so he did not recognize the
young man. Josef smiled as he thought of his long hair, shaggy
beard, and army pants.
    Josef told the pastor of his experiences with Satan, the motor-
cycle accidents, and his subsequent search for God. The pastor
arranged to begin personal Bible studies that would answer Josef s
questions about God. Josef was an eager student and the pastor a
 patient teacher. Josef thanks God for saving him from death while
 riding his motorcycle; but even more, for saving him from eternal
 death at the hands of Satan and giving him a new life, new hope,
 and the promise of an eternity with Christ.

   Mihalet Dogaborh is a pastor in Hungary. Josef now lives in Goreab,
a small town in Hungary.

Lesson 10                              November 28—December 4

      My Father and My God




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Deut. 7:6-8; Ps. 34:8-10;
91:2; 145:18; Mal. 3:16, 17; Rom. 8:38, 39.

   MEMORY TEXT: "You are my Father, My God, and the
   rock of my salvation"' (Psalm 89:26, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: The God of all creation awaits our invitation
for Him to be our dearest Friend and closest Companion, so that we
may be His special people.

   GOD WAS VERY REAL TO DAVID. He knew from personal
experience that the Lord guided the meek and taught them His ways
(Ps. 25:9). He had learned that God gave strength to His people and
blessed them with peace (Ps. 29:11). He had the assurance that the
Lord encamped about those who feared Him and that He delivered
them (Ps. 34:7). To David that person was a fool who said, "There is
no God" (Ps. 53:1).
   Because the lovingkindness of God was better than life to David,
he praised God with joyful lips. Because the Lord had been his help,
David rejoiced in the shadow of the heavenly wings (Ps. 63:3-7).
   The purpose of the lesson this week is to see how the God of heaven is
the personal God of His children on earth. From the time of Adam to the
present, there have always been people who knew God as their Saviour
from sin, their Deliverer from evil, and their Guide and Companion in
daily life. There is nothing more important in life than to become
acquainted with God as a personal Friend. As you study this lesson, ask
yourself, How personal is God to me?

GOD AND HIS PEOPLE (Mal. 3:16, 17).


 List at least three ways the Lord relates to those who love Him.
Mal. 3:16, 17.
  1.

  3.

   The first few lessons this quarter revealed the great and magnifi-
cent qualities of God. Succeeding lessons have introduced His more
endearing qualities—His interest in us, His redeeming love, and His
thoughts of peace. This week we will see this divine Being through the
eyes of Bible writers who were particularly conscious of Him as a
personal Friend. We will invite Him into our hearts and homes and
share with Him our loftiest joys, as well as our most deeply rooted
sorrows. We will have the opportunity to begin a lasting friendship (if
we have not formed one already) with the One who created us and
understands us perfectly.

  Because of how God relates to us, how should we relate to one
another? Heb. 10:24, 25.


   If any people on earth deserve to associate themselves closely
together in meaningful fellowship, it is the saints of God. They did so
in Old Testament times and also after the Saviour came to earth. God
watches over them in this fellowship and blesses them in it.
   But the saints are not to fix their eyes on themselves and their own
affairs. They are to look at the needs of those around them and
encourage everyone to be more loving and more active in good deeds.
Saints are not to be concerned only with personal salvation but also
with the salvation of others. This means faithful attendance at meet-
ings where they can encourage one another and give public testimony
to their unity and common faith. This becomes more important in
Christian life as the Second Advent approaches.

    Because Janene is shy, she seldom speaks to people first. When
 she attended church, she grew tired of people speaking only to her
 husband and not her. So she quit attending. What are some other
 reasons people might not attend these services? What can you do
 to improve things for them? Think of someone you have not seen
 in church for quite a while. Write them a friendly note or give
 them a cheery call to tell them you have missed them.

                                                                   81

GOD AND THE INDIVIDUAL, PART ONE (Dent. 7:6-8).


   Why and for what purpose did God choose Israel? Deut. 7:6-8.
   Why
   For what purpose

  What qualities of Abraham showed him to be one of God's
people? Gen. 12:1-4, 7, 8; 14:20; 15:6; 18:17-19.


    In Isaiah 41:8, God speaks of Abraham as "my friend." How did
this friendship come to be? It appears that God made the first move.
He came to Abraham (Gen. 12:1) and commanded him to move out of
Ur and into a "land that I will show you" (RSV). The story suggests
that God and Abraham entered into a gentleman's agreement for the
purpose of establishing a great nation that would bring blessing to the
whole world. Abraham's side of the friendship occasionally left much
to be desired. He sometimes acted out of fear rather than principle.
Yet his Friend did not forsake him.
   To become a friend of God requires a response to His friendship.
That involves accepting His protection, His wisdom, His guidance,
and His friendship. "[God] watches over us with more tenderness than
does a mother over an afflicted child. . . . God is a friend in perplexity
and affliction, a protector in distress, a preserver in the thousand
dangers that are unseen to us."—Sons and Daughters of God, p. 16.
   The psalmist spoke of meditating on the law of the Lord and on His
works. God was his delight. His mind frequently turned to the goodness
of his Maker and to the marvelous provisions He has made for the
happiness of all His creatures. This kind of thought life leads to trust.
Can there be a meaningful friendship without trust? To lift one's thoughts
to heaven, to appreciate the tiny blessings of life as well as the dramatic
providences, to contemplate the majesty of forests and mountains, to see
beauty in a leaf—these are some of the ways we draw near to God. The
Bible directs us toward our Creator and enhances our ability to see God
at work. Reading the sacred pages in personal devotion brings us close to
our Friend. The promise then is ours: "Draw near to God and he will
draw near to you" (James 4:8, RSV).

    In what ways does God give us assurance that He will help us
 as His people? Isa. 41:8-10; 43:5-7, 10. What impact does such
 assurance have on your life today? In what ways does such a life
 of assurance in God affect our witness to our friends, neighbors,
 and colleagues who are experiencing heartache and trials?

GOD AND THE INDIVIDUAL, PART TWO (Ps. 91:2).

  Describe the psalmist's personal relationship to God. Ps. 91:2.


   "Those who surrender their lives to His guidance and to His service
will never be placed in a position for which He has not made provision.
Whatever our situation, if we are doers of His word, we have a Guide to
direct our way; whatever our perplexity, we have a sure Counselor;
whatever our sorrow, bereavement, or loneliness, we have a
sympathizing Friend."—The Ministry of Healing, pp. 248, 249.
   "If we have fellowship with Him, we must ever set the Lord before
us, and treat Him as an honored Friend, giving Him the first place in
our affections."—Sons and Daughters of God, p. 27.

  What words or phrases in the following passages indicate a
personal relationship with God?
   Job 19:25-27
   Luke 1:28
   2 Tim 4.8

  What words or phrases in the following texts indicate we can all
have a personal relationship with God?
   Rev. 3:20-22
   John 1:9
   Rom. 1:16

  Explain the three things that should happen to a person when
she or he personally encounters God. Isa. 6:1-13.


  All the wonderful things God has done for others He desires and
has promised to do for each one of us. What we must do is allow the
eyes of our spiritual vision to be opened and to respond to God when
He addresses us.

    What is the secret of experiencing the reality of God's pres-
 ence? Jer. 29:13. What are the things that keep you from enjoy-
 ing a personal experience with God? What can you do about
 them, with God's help?


                                                                    83
Wednesday                                            December 2
THE NEARNESS OF GOD (Ps. 145:18).

   If Christians view God as a chief accountant, they will not want Him
too near. The account book, with its debits and credits, may have too
exact a record. It would be better if God were not too close. However, if
Christians view God as their Friend and themselves as His special
possessions, the thought of God's presence will bring vigor and delight
to each hour.

   Describe the people who find that God is near to them.


   The expression "to call upon" the Lord means to worship Him, to
recognize His strength and our dependence. We are always in need of
help. To whom shall we turn in our need? We may be tempted to turn
to other people or even to one who holds a high station in life. But the
psalmist warns against this. (See Ps. 118:8, 9.) There is only One to
whom we can turn to supply our deepest needs.
   Our challenge is that our worship shall be "in truth"—in sincerity
and singleness of heart. We must never divide our loyalty or fail in
trust and confidence. Sometimes we are tempted to put our trust in a
bank balance, in friends, in our skill, or cleverness. It seems easier to
have confidence in what we can see and feel rather than in God who is
invisible and apparently intangible. But a faith that is the "evidence of
things not seen" (Heb. 11:1) must motivate us in all our dealings with
God. Then we can be sure He will never let us down as we let Him
have His way in our lives.

  Under what circumstance did Jesus say He and the Father
would make Their abode with us? John 14:23.


   "Our heart the home of God! The door into which Christ turns with
the restful feeling that he is in his own place, where love will meet him
and surround him, where he is at home. So much do these broken bits
of faith and affection which we are half ashamed to offer him mean to
our Lord. For it is still true that he comes unto his own, and they
receive him not. . . .
   "And if remembering our many failures and disloyalties, our hearts
misgive us, Zacchaeus also had a sorry record. Yet Christ asked for his
hospitality. Our home, says Christ, speaking of himself and God.
Our Home!"—The Interpreter's Bible, vol. 8, pp. 710, 711.

   What is the difference between feeling the nearness of God and
 having faith in His nearness? When have you experienced both?

THE GOODNESS OF GOD (Ps. 34:8-10).

   What invitation does God extend to us? Ps. 34:8-10.


   The goodness of God is revealed in that He provides us with
everything we really need. We are to experience God's abundant
provision. Nothing is more convincing than experience—being in that
situation where only God can be the source of our supplies. We always
are afraid of being without our daily needs. But when circumstances
take away every visible means of support and we find that God has
supplied every need, then we are tasting how good God is. Happy is
that person whose trust in God has not been in vain.
    The imagery of the lion going hungry is very striking. Can the king of
beasts with all its strength go hungry? Yes, it can, says the psalmist. But
those who trust in God will never find themselves without
necessities. Their lot is better than that of the most naturally privileged.

   In view of God's goodness, how should we respond? Ps. 107:8,
9; 105:1, 2.


   "Appreciate the goodness of God. Count your blessings. Learn not
to take natural benefits, endowments, and pleasures for granted; learn
to thank God for them all. Do not slight the Bible, or the gospel of
Jesus Christ, by an attitude of casualness towards either. . . . Ask
yourself the psalmist's question—'What shall I render unto the LORD
for all his benefits toward me?' Seek grace to give his answer-1 will
take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD. . . . 0
LORD, truly I am thy servant. . . . I will pay my vows unto the LORD
now' (Psalm 116:12)." Knowing God, p. 150.
    We also will respond to God's goodness by becoming a channel of
blessing to the world. One of God's laws of giving and receiving is
that those who share with others the blessings they have received soon
receive added blessings from the Giver of every good and perfect gift.
If the church as a body would bend its energies to bringing God's
limitless blessings to the world, its own state would be greatly el-
evated and its progress toward the kingdom markedly advanced.
    "Those who thus become participants in labors of love are brought
nearest to their Creator."—Steps to Christ, p. 79.


    Think of a time when things were going badly for you. What
 evidence existed even then of God's goodness? How did He still
 supply everything you needed?

                                                                        85
Friday                                               December 4
FURTHER STUDY: This week we have learned about God's
relationship with His people, God's relationship with the individual,
God's nearness, and His goodness. To learn about His invincible love for
us, read Romans 8:38, 39 and Matthew 23:37. What comparison does
Paul make between human love and God's love in Romans 5:6-8? What
illustration does Isaiah 49:15 use to indicate that God cannot forget His
people? Also read "God's Love for Man," pp. 9-15, in Steps to Christ.

   "When through poverty a Hebrew had been forced to part with his
patrimony [inheritance], and to sell himself as a bondservant, the duty
of redeeming him and his inheritance fell to the one who was nearest
of kin. See Lev. 25:25, 47-49; Ruth 2:20. So the work of redeeming us
and our inheritance, lost through sin, fell upon Him who is 'near of
kin' unto us. It was to redeem us that He became our kinsman. Closer
than father, mother, brother, friend, or lover is the Lord our Saviour.
`Fear not,' He says, 'for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by
thy name; thou art mine.' . . .
   "Christ loves the heavenly beings that surround His throne; but
what shall account for the great love wherewith He has loved us? We
cannot understand it, but we can know it true in our own experience.
And if we do hold the relation of kinship to Him, with what tenderness
should we regard those who are brethren and sisters of our Lord!"
—The Desire of Ages, p. 327.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What good for the church and the world may come from
     the interaction of saints? Think of specific examples.

   2. What attitude is favorable for staying in close touch with God?

   3. Explain what it means to practice the presence of God. How
      do you practice the presence of God in your life?

   4. How would you explain to a curious friend what God means
      to you? David said God was the light of his pathway and the
      strength of his life (Ps. 27:1; also see Ps. 18:2). Fill in the
      blanks below to explain what God is to you:

SUMMARY: In light of God's magnificent qualities, we are totally
unworthy. Yet this great God invites us to experience personally His
presence, love, and goodness. If we will rely upon Him in patience, He
will bring us through distressing experiences as more than conquerors.

                        The Jesus Cow
                       As told by Deep Thapa

    The majestic Himalayas towered brilliantly in the blue sky
outside the shop window. But the tailor inside hardly noticed. His
skillful fingers guided needle and thread through cloth as he lis-
tened to the message coming from his shortwave radio. Through
the speaker's words, a seed of hope had been planted that began to
grow in his heart, a hope that would change his life. The program
was the Voice of Hope, heard over Adventist World Radio.
    Some weeks later a friend came to the tailor's shop and noticed
a new sign above the door. "What does it mean, 'The Shop of the
Jesus Tailor'? What is Jesus?" he asked.
    The tailor told him the wonderful news he was learning on the
radio, that Jesus Christ came to earth, lived, died, and was resur-
rected from the dead. And all who believe in Him do not have to
worry about the future. "Since Jesus has done all that for me, I put
His name on my shop sign."
    The tailor's friend wanted to know more, so the two men began
to study the Bible together. One day the friend said, "I am almost
convinced that this Jesus is God, but I want to see if prayer really
works." He thought for a while then posed a test. "Your cow does
not give milk." The tailor nodded. "If you ask Jesus to make that
cow give milk, and if she does give milk, then I will be con-
vinced!" The tailor agreed. After all, if Jesus had the power to save
him, surely He could make his cow give milk.
    After his friend left, the tailor went to the shed, laid his hands
on the cow, and began to pray. Then he wondered, Would God
think this was a silly request, not worthy of His attention? He
dismissed the thought, finished his prayer, and returned to work.
    A little later he returned to the cow shed. He stood looking at
his cow for a minute, then took a pail, pulled up a stool, and began
 to milk his cow. Milk flowed in a steady stream.
    The tailor jumped up and ran to get his friend. "You must
 come!" he said. "Come, see for yourself'!" The two men returned to
 the cow shed, and the tailor's friend watched in wonder as his
 friend milked his cow.
    High on the slopes of the Himalayas stands the Shop of the
 Jesus Tailor. And behind the shop lives the Jesus cow, a testimony
 to one man's faith in the God who listens to prayers.
     Pray that the message of salvation will spread throughout Nepal.

Adventists.

            The Lord of Hosts




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Gen. 19:1, 12, 13; Matt.
16:27; Luke 2:8-11; Heb. 1:14; Rev. 5:11; 7:1.

   MEMORY TEXT: "The angel of the Lord encamps all around
   those who fear Him, and delivers them" (Psalm 34:7, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: The angels, who serve God unselfishly, play an
important role in our everyday life, and they work actively for our
salvation.

   WHO ARE THE "HOSTS"? The scriptural usage points to the
angels as representing the hosts over which God is Lord. Angels
surround His throne and do His bidding. Occasionally, people have
seen them and recognized in them a power available for their protec-
tion. (See Gen. 32:1, 2; 2 Kings 6:17.)
   David mentions the title "Lord of hosts" when he approaches Goliath
(1 Sam. 17:45). He uses it again in the climax to his poem of praise in
Psalm 24 (verse 10). Jeremiah uses the name 88 times as indicating
that God is the Saviour and Protector of His people.
   To understand God better, we need to understand something about
His angelic hosts. In heaven, there are thousands of them, ten thousand
times ten thousand, ever worshiping God and ready to go on their
missions throughout the universe. Myriads of them are at God's service
here in this world. Each child of God has his or her own guardian angel.
This angel always has access to God Himself on His heavenly throne.
   This week, we shall try to become better acquainted with God by
studying the work of His angelic hosts. We will see how He uses
angels in His activities for humankind.

ANGELS ABOUT GOD'S THRONE (Rev. 5:11).

   What creatures and how many of them does John see around
the throne of God? Rev. 5:11.


   Heaven is the headquarters of the universe. There God is seated on
His throne. God is infinitely great. The universe is infinitely large. Its
work must be one of almost unbelievable complexity. It is through
angels that God conducts His work.
   God's work for the world is of great importance, to Him and to every
one of us, whether sinner or saint. Every detail is closely watched. Not a
sparrow in this little earth of ours falls to the ground without His notice.
No king rules, no saint falls, without God's being aware of it.
   Angels keep all the extremely complex and mutually interwoven
affairs of earth under Heaven's control. In Ezekiel 1:15-21 and 10:9-16,
the seemingly chaotic array of worldly affairs is likened to four wheels
kept under the control of four living creatures, cherubim, who in turn are
under the direction of God. (See Ezek. 1:26, 28; 10:1, 5, 18-20.)
   "The seraphim around the throne are so filled with reverential
awe as they behold the glory of God, that they do not for an instant look
upon themselves with admiration. Their praise is for the Lord of
hosts. . . . They are fully satisfied to glorify God; abiding in His presence,
beneath His smile of approbation, they wish for nothing more."
—Evangelism, p. 21.

  Describe Jacob's dream in Genesis 28:10-15. What does it
symbolize?


   David spoke of God's "throne in the heavens" and of His kingdom
which "ruleth over all," with His "angels that excel in strength, that do
his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word," the
"ministers of his, that do his pleasure" (Ps. 103:19-21). Micaiah saw "the
Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on
his right hand and on his left" (1 Kings 22:19). Daniel beheld the Ancient
of Days seated on His throne, which appeared "like the fiery flame"
(Dan. 7:9, 10). Peter tells us that angels are even interested in our
salvation (1 Pet. 1:10-12). These things, which mortal eyes cannot see,
are just as real as, and infinitely more important than, the visible things
of earth. The Bible draws the curtain aside and helps us to glimpse the
close connection between heaven and earth.

    Why would angels be interested in your salvation? What does
 this tell us about their nature?

                                                                          89

ATTENDANTS OF CHRIST (Matt. 16:27).

   What role do angels play in Christ's second coming? Matt.
16:27; Luke 9:26.


    The angels of heaven are the attendants of Christ and are under His
command. When Satan rebelled and was cast to earth, a majority of
the angels remained loyal to Christ. (See Rev. 12:4, 7, 8.)
    Since the first rebellion, all the loyal angelic host has been closely
connected with Christ in continued warfare against the dragon. In the
conduct of the work of Heaven, many activities involve the entire
universe. But none are of greater importance than those activities
having to do with winning the world back to God. The angels are
closely connected with Christ in the conduct of this work, ever eager
to be sent on missions of mercy.
   "Our Saviour . . . is surrounded with heavenly intelligences, cheru-
bim, and seraphim, ten thousand times ten thousand of angels.
   "All these heavenly beings have one object above all others, in
which they are intensely interested—His church in a world of
corruption. All these armies are in the service of the Prince of heaven,
exalting the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the world.
They are working for Christ under His commission, to save to the
uttermost all who look to Him and believe in Him. These heavenly
intelligences are speeding on their mission, doing for Christ that
which Herod and Pilate did against Him. They confederate together
to uphold the honor and glory of God. They are united in a holy
alliance, . . . to show forth the power and compassion and love and
glory of the crucified and risen Saviour." Ellen G. White Comments,
SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, pp. 967, 968.

   On what two special occasions did angels minister to Christ?
   Matt. 4:1-11
   Luke 22:39-43

   When Christ prayed to have "the cup" removed from Him,
God responded by sending an angel to strengthen Him instead.
Looking back over your life, was there a time when you prayed
to have "a cup" removed but God sent an angel to help you
drink "the cup" instead? What form did "the cup" and the angel
take? How does this experience prepare you to identify with and

ANGELIC MINISTRY TO PEOPLE (Heb. 1:14).

  Describe the work angels do for humans. Heb. 1:14.


    If we would understand the impact of angel ministry in our lives,
we must first appreciate angels' involvement in the work of Heaven.
In a previous lesson, we learned the extent to which the Trinity have
expended Themselves for the sake of this world. This is not to say that
God is any less involved in upholding other inhabited worlds or in
communing with their holy inhabitants. Not at all. But this world has
been the object of untold attention and immeasurable blessings
because it is a lost world. As "foot soldiers" of God's army, angels are
used in every battle and participate in every victory. They are
personally involved.
    "Into the experience of all there come times of keen disappoint-
ment and utter discouragement—days when sorrow is the portion, and
it is hard to believe that God is still the kind benefactor of His
earthborn children. . . . Could we at such times discern with spiritual
insight the meaning of God's providences, we should see angels
seeking to save us from ourselves, striving to plant our feet upon a
foundation more firm than the everlasting hills; and new faith, new
life, would spring into being."—Prophets and Kings, p. 162.

   How did angels minister to humans in the following verses?
   Acts 12:7-10
   Matt. 28:1-7

  How only can we be aware of the work of angels on our behalf?
2 Kings 6:17.


   "Angels are constantly ascending and descending this ladder of
shining brightness, bearing the prayers of the needy and distressed to
the Father above, and bringing blessing and hope, courage and help, to
the children of men. These angels of light create a heavenly atmos-
phere about the soul, lifting us toward the unseen and the eternal."
—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 153.

    As you pray Elisha's prayer in 2 Kings 6:17, replace the word his
 with the word my and the word he with the word I. Then envision the
 angels ascending and descending the ladder, bearing your prayer to
 the Lord of Hosts and bringing you blessing and hope in return.

                                                                    91

BEARERS OF GOOD TIDINGS (Luke 2:8-11).

 What news did an angel host bring to shepherds? Luke 2:8-12.
What song did a host of angels sing? Verses 13, 14.


    "Heaven and earth are no wider apart today than when shepherds
listened to the angels' song. Humanity is still as much the object of
heaven's solicitude as when common men of common occupations met
angels at noonday, and talked with the heavenly messengers in the
vineyards and the fields. To us in the common walks of life, heaven may
be very near. Angels from the courts above will attend the steps of those
who come and go at God's commands."—The Desire of Ages, p. 48.

  Describe other instances when angels communicated important
messages from God.

   Gen. 19:1-23

   Judg. 13:1-5

   Matt. 1:18-21

   Matt. 28:1-7

   Luke 1:26-38

   Acts 1:10, 11

   Acts 27:22-24

   When Mary first received her angel messenger, his news greatly
troubled her. But as he continued with the rest of the message, she grew
calm and accepting. Thus, she symbolizes what we all can become by
God's grace—ready and willing to act upon His instructions,
submissive to His will.

   "Do not forget to entertain [be hospitable to] strangers, for by
doing so some people have entertained angels without knowing
it" (Heb. 13:2, NIV). This was written at a time when inns were
rare, and those that did exist were dirty, prohibitively expen-
sive, and of poor repute. Thus the same need for hospitality may
not be as great today. But the principle remains. What hospital-
ity needs exist today? How can we as Christians fulfill them?

MESSAGES OF DOOM (Gen. 19:1, 12, 13).

   Sometimes the special assignments given to angels were unpleasant
tasks. After Adam and Eve's disobedience, angels escorted them from
their garden home and guarded the tree of life. (See Early Writings, pp.
148, 149.) Shortly before the Flood, with Noah and his family and
selected animals safely inside the ark, an angel came to close the door.
   Angels aided in the confusion at the tower of Babel and worked
mightily in behalf of the children of Israel prior to their escape from
Egypt by bringing destruction to that nation.

   What message did an angel give in Genesis 19:1, 12, 13?


   Because of its iniquity, God saw fit to withdraw His protection and
mercy, and the city met its doom. Angels carried out His purpose. At
the same time angels were working to save Lot and his family. Their
patience and insistence is an example of how God is eager to save us
from the destruction of this world.

   How are angels involved in the following passages?
   2 Chron. 32:20, 21
   1 Chron. 21:14, 15
   Rev. 16

   "The God of the Hebrews had prevailed over the proud Assyrian
[Sennacherib]. The honor of Jehovah was vindicated in the eyes of the
surrounding nations. In Jerusalem the hearts of the people were filled
with holy joy. Their earnest entreaties for deliverance had been mingled
with confession of sin and with many tears. In their great need they had
trusted wholly in the power of God to save, and He had not failed them."
—Prophets and Kings, pp. 361, 362.
   At the end of time, angels will again carry out the will of God as the
history of sin is closed. They will conduct the work involved with the
plagues and the sealing. (See Rev. 16; 7:2, 3; Prophets and Kings,
p. 591.) Then, at last, earth's clouds will part and down the trackless
corridors of space will come all the angels of heaven accompanying their
King as He returns to take His redeemed ones home with Him. How
bright they will shine! How richly fulfilled they will be as they reopen
the gates to Paradise and escort their human friends to the tree of life!

   How do you reconcile these destructive acts of God's angels
 with the goodness of God?

                                                                     93
Friday                                              December 11
FURTHER STUDY: Angels also serve as controlling agents. How did
John the revelator see them in this capacity? Rev. 7:1. How was Daniel
saved from death? Dan. 6:22. Also read Selected Messages, book 1, pp.
96, 97 and Testimonies for the Church, vol. 6, pp. 456, 457.
   Angels unseen are commissioned by God to hold in check
throughout the earth powers that could prematurely explode into
outbreaks that would engulf the entire world in final destruction. Satan
incites people everywhere to outbursts of wrath and violence. But angels
from God hold them in check. Had it not been for the restraining
activities of the angels, earth's troubles would long since have erupted
into conflicts that would have ended only in Armageddon.

   "Fearful tests and trials await the people of God. The spirit of war is
stirring the nations from one end of the earth to the other. But in the
midst of the time of trouble that is coming—a time of trouble such as has
not been since there was a nation—God's chosen people will stand
unmoved. Satan and his angels cannot destroy them, for angels that excel
in strength will protect them."—Selected Messages, book 2, p. 55.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Why is a message from an angel as authoritative as if it
     came directly from God Himself?

   2. How do angels relate to those who suffer trials and
      persecution? Base your answer on biblical examples.

   3. How does God use angels to protect us in times of danger?
      Base your answer on biblical examples. Does this mean that
      as Christians we will never suffer? Explain. How can angels
      be with us when harm does befall us? Again, base your
      answer on examples in the Bible.

   4. In what ways have you recognized the intervention of an-
      gels in your life?

SUMMARY: The God of heaven, whom we serve, is the Lord of
hosts. Under His command innumerable angels move throughout the
universe, fulfilling His wishes. Nothing delights them more than to
perform some duty, some service, for their beloved Maker.
    Angels are by our sides continually. They encourage us in the way of
life. They offer us opportunities for spiritual growth. They minister to
our every need. Should we not praise God for giving us such personal
attention and sustaining us constantly on the battlefield of life?

                   Following a Good Example
                           Satulu Gerembaya

   As a child growing up in Kinshasa, Zaire (now Republic of
Congo), I lived near an Adventist church. I knew nothing about the
church or the people who worshiped there, except that they were
different. My friends and I sometimes threw stones and shouted
accusations at the believers as we walked by the church.
   Some years later a friend told me that, according to Revelation
13, the Catholic and Protestant churches would combine and per-
secute Christians who kept God's laws. I could not understand
how Christians could hurt other Christians. Then I began to won-
der who were these Christians who kept God's law.
   Shortly after I was married, my wife became a Seventh-day Adventist.
I was not happy when she told me, for I still thought this church was
a bad church. I got angry when she refused to go to the market or
cook on Saturday or when she refused to eat certain foods, even
though she prepared them for me. But I noticed that when I argued
with her, she no longer argued back. Something had changed.
   I went to another area of Zaire to work in the gold mines. I
discovered that the Adventist church was there too! Curious, I
decided to attend a service. As I listened to the preacher and
studied the texts he gave, many of the things my wife did began to
make sense to me. I liked the way Adventists worshiped too. They
did not shout or play loud music as my church did. When I learned
about returning a tenth of my earnings to God, who gave them to
me, I decided to try. I began returning tithe and waited to see what
would happen. Not long after this I found a gold nugget weighing
about six pounds!
    I returned to Kinshasa and began attending church with my wife. I
read some Ellen White books, and soon I realized that the religious
minority that would be persecuted for "keeping the law" was the
                          Adventist church. I decided to be baptized.
                              African men want women to follow them,
                          but this time I was glad to follow my wife's
                           example! My only regret is that so many
                           years passed before I took my stand. I think
                           of all the people I could have witnessed to
                           over the years and wish I had made the
                           decision sooner.

                              Satulu Gerembaya is a businessman living
                           in Kinshasa, Republic of Congo.

              The God of Help




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ps. 27:1-3; 48:14; Isa. 41:10;
59:18-20; Nah. 1:7; Eph. 3:20.

   MEMORY TEXT: "So we may boldly say: 'The Lord is my helper;
   I will not fear. What can man do to me?" (Hebrews 13:6, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: God's unlimited power is available to help us,
protect us, and guide us in all situations.

   "I NEED AN AMBULANCE!" When people dial an emergency
telephone system for help, they immediately reach a dispatcher who
reads on his or her computer screen the caller's name, phone number,
and address. That way, even if the person calling cannot clearly
describe the problem, the dispatcher can still send emergency person-
nel. As Christians, we have a God who knows our name, location, and
circumstance even before we call for help.
   If, in past ages, God's people needed to know Him as their Helper,
there is much greater need today. Now in earth's last hours, there are
greater trials, temptations, and dangers than ever before. We are living
during the time in which Christ warned that efforts would be made, if
possible, to "deceive the very elect" (Matt. 24:24). These are the times
about which God spoke when He said the devil would come down in
"great wrath," knowing "that he hath but a short time," and that the
dragon would be "wroth with the woman" and would "make war with
the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and
have the testimony of Jesus Christ" (Rev. 12:12, 17). In this lesson,
we shall endeavor to become better acquainted with God as our divine
Helper and Protector.

GOD'S GREAT POWER TO HELP (Eph. 3:20).

  What was Paul's view of God's power to help? Eph. 3:20. Focus
on the significant words he used to describe the extent of God's
willingness to help.


    When we want someone to do something for us, we go to someone
who is able to do it. If we want a watch repaired, a motor fixed, a
house built, we go to someone competent.
    We are conditioned to think that, in these days of scientific progress,
there is no limit to what science can do. We talk of the miracles of
medicine and technology. We think that all we need to do is to invest
more money and time, and we will find the answers. But the fact is
that we are limited by time and conditioned by environment. With all
our efforts and skill, we still face death and the end of the world. If we
are wise, we will look beyond the immediate and recognize a God who
is there to help; and there is no limit to what He can do.

   Explain Paul's attitude regarding his "weakness," or "thorn."
2 Cor. 12:7-10.


   "The weakness or defect can bring people into the condition in
which they are open to God's Spirit. We come to God through the
sense of need. The feeling of inadequacy turns into prayer. . . . We
come to that dependence only when self-sufficiency has been broken
by some situation or experience that is too much for us. When self in
its various forms is laid in the dust, God can fully come in."—The
Interpreter's Bible, vol. 10, p. 409.
    Isaiah 40:28-31 assures us that when we "wait upon the Lord," our
strength will be renewed, and we will soar like eagles. To "wait upon
the Lord" is not simply to do nothing. It is to look to God for guidance
and strength. In Him and not in ourselves is the secret of success in our
struggles with ourselves, with our environment, and with the task God
has given us to do.
    Does the church feel that Christ's command to give the gospel to all
nations is too great a task? Let it recall His promise: "Lo, I am with
you alway, even unto the end of the world." "All power is given unto
me in heaven and in earth" (Matt. 28:20, 18). Yes, the One who
promised to be with us has all the power in the universe!

   What "weakness" have you been struggling with lately? How
 has it taught you to depend more on God? Pray that He will give
 you strength to endure and guidance to continue working for Him.

                                                                       97

GOD'S WILLINGNESS TO HELP (Isa. 41:10).

   Why does God say we need not be afraid in any circumstance?
Isa. 41:10.

    Every child of God may have complete confidence in God's
willingness to help and in His ability and purpose to strengthen and
uphold. As a mother loves her child and would make any sacrifice in
its behalf, so with God.
    When Elijah ran for his life after Jezebel threatened him, the Lord
made Himself known to Elijah, showing him "that quiet trust and firm
reliance upon God will ever find Him a present help in time of need. . . .
    "We have the frailties of mortal feelings to contend with. But if we
trust in God, He will never leave nor forsake us. Under all circumstances
we may have firm trust in God, that He will never leave nor forsake us
while we preserve our integrity."—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 3,
pp. 292, 293.
    "To all who are reaching out to feel the guiding hand of God, the
moment of greatest discouragement is the time when divine help is
nearest. They will look back with thankfulness upon the darkest part
of their way. 'The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly.' 2 Peter
2:9. From every temptation and every trial He will bring them forth
with firmer faith and a richer experience."—The Desire of Ages,
p. 528. (Review 1 Kings 19:3-18.)

   How certain was the psalmist that God would provide for him?
Ps. 27:10. What assurance may we have concerning the watchcare
of God? Ps. 121:3-7.


   "In His loving care and interest in us, often He who understands us
better than we understand ourselves refuses to permit us selfishly to
seek the gratification of our own ambition. He does not permit us to
pass by the homely but sacred duties that lie next to us. Often these
duties afford the very training essential to prepare us for a higher
work. Often our plans fail, that God's plans for us may succeed. . . .
   "In the future life, the mysteries that here have annoyed and disap-
pointed us will be made plain. We shall see that our seemingly
unanswered prayers and disappointed hopes have been among our
greatest blessings."—The Ministry of Healing, pp. 473, 474.

   If God is always for me, why do events so often appear to be
against me? Why does God often seem willing to help me at a
time or in a way of His choosing instead of mine? How can I keep
from becoming discouraged when this happens?

GOD, THE PROTECTOR OF HIS PEOPLE (Ps. 27:1-3).

   List the things David did not fear, because the Lord was his
light and salvation. Ps. 27:1-3.


   Do we sometimes feel the whole world is against us? Perhaps! But
we have no reason to fear the outcome. With God, our Helper, on our
side, we can be sure of victory. We have enemies. But we need not
fear them. We who endeavor to do right have the forces of evil against
us. But we need not live in terror. What we need is faith in God and the
courage that comes with it. With these we may have peace in our heart
and victory in our life.

   What may be our confidence? Ps. 17:6-15.


    In this psalm, David dials, as it were, God's emergency phone
system.
    Apple of the eye. The Hebrew for this phrase literally means "a
little man." "The term is applied to the pupil of the eye, probably
because, as in a mirror, one sees a tiny image of himself. The prayer is
that God will guard the psalmist as a man protects his eyesight.
Compare a similar figure in Deut. 32:10 and Prov. 7:2.
    "Shadow of thy wings. This phrase, common in the psalms,
suggests a mother bird protecting her young. Compare a similar figure
in Deut. 32:11, 12 and Matt. 23:37."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3,
p. 668.
    "All Paths Are Beset With Peril.—You need not be surprised if
everything in the journey heavenward is not pleasant. There is no use
in looking to our own defects. Looking unto Jesus, the darkness passes
away, and the true light shineth. Go forth daily, expressing the prayer
of David, 'Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.'
All the paths of life are beset with peril, but we are safe if we follow
where the Master leads the way, trusting the One whose voice we hear
saying, 'Follow me.' He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness,
but shall have the light of life.' Let your heart repose in His love. We
need sanctification, soul, body, and spirit. This we must seek for."
 —Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 3, p. 1143.

    What "armies" are attacking you? What "wars" are you

THE GOD OF EMERGENCIES (Isa. 59:18-20).

  When God's people find themselves in emergency situations,
what will He do for them? Isa. 59:18-20.


   We live in a world where those who endeavor to serve God must
expect manifestations of the power of the enemy and revealings of the
power of God. Left to themselves alone, the children of God would be
no match for the relentless foe. But the battle is not theirs alone. It is
God's. In every crisis the Lord is with His people, ready to defend and
deliver.
   "Again and again throughout history God has intervened in the
most marvelous ways to deliver His people. Such will again be the
experience of God's people in the great crisis at the end of time. At the
moment the wicked of earth think they have the saints completely
within their power, the Lord will manifest Himself, destroying their
enemies and taking the saints home with Him to receive their
inheritance."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 312.

   Review some of the emergency situations listed here. How does
the Lord's intervention in each case help to strengthen your faith?
Exod. 14:5-33; Esther 3-8; Dan. 3. What does verse 18 teach us
about the true nature of faith?

   "From age to age the Lord has made known the manner of His
working. When a crisis has come, He has revealed Himself, and has
interposed to hinder the working out of Satan's plans. With nations,
with families, and with individuals, He has often permitted matters to
come to a crisis, that His interference might become marked. Then He
has made manifest that there is a God in Israel who will maintain His
law and vindicate His people."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 178.
   "His [God's] power is absolute. . . .
   "In the darkest days, when appearances seem most forbidding,
have faith in God. He is working out His will, doing all things well in
behalf of His people. The strength of those who love and serve Him
will be renewed day by day.
   "He is able and willing to bestow upon His servants all the help
they need. He will give them the wisdom which their varied necessi-
ties demand."—The Ministry of Healing, pp. 481, 482.

   In what emergency situation do you presently find yourself?
How is God helping you through it? Can you say, like Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego, "Even if God does not save me from
this situation, I will still serve Him"?

GOD GUIDES HIS PEOPLE (Ps. 48:14; 32:8).

  What does Psalm 48:14 tell us about our need for God's guid-
ance? How personal is God's guidance? Ps. 32:8.


   "I will guide you with My eye" (NKJV). Guidance with the eye is
a close and intimate guidance. It is more than giving instructions and
leaving a person to carry them out. It means watching the person
continually to make sure every move is correct. It is the guidance a
parent would give a child, freely, willingly, and with a deep concern
for the child's best interest.
    "Bob Mumford, in Take Another Look at Guidance, compares
discovering God's will with a sea captain's docking procedure:
    "A certain harbor in Italy can be reached only by sailing up a
narrow channel between dangerous rocks and shoals. Over the years,
many ships have been wrecked, and navigation is hazardous.
    "To guide the ships safely into port, three lights have been mounted
on three huge poles in the harbor. When the three lights are perfectly
lined up and seen as one, the ship can safely proceed up the narrow
channel. If the pilot sees two or three lights, he knows he's off course
and in danger.
    "God has also provided three beacons to guide us. The same rules
of navigation apply—the three lights must be lined up before it is safe
for us to proceed. The three harbor lights of guidance are:
    1.The Word of God (objective standard)
    2. The Holy Spirit (subjective witness)
    3. Circumstances (divine providence)
    "Together they assure us that the directions we've received are
 from God and will lead us safely along his way."—Illustrations for
 Preaching and Teaching From Leadership Journal, Craig Brian Larson,
 ed. (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Books, 1994), p. 108. (See also
 Testimonies for the Church, vol. 5, p. 512.)
    "Let all who claim to be preparing for the coming of the Lord
 humbly seek Him for a knowledge of His will, and for a spirit that is
 willing to walk in all the light He sends. . . . Let us go to the Word of
 God for instruction."—Selected Messages, book 2, p. 326.

  Memorize one of the following prayers for God's guidance and
pray it often: Ps. 27:11; 31:3; 43:3.


    How can we make sure the impressions of our hearts (subjec-
 tive witness) are right impressions?


                                                                     101
Friday                                             December 18
FURTHER STUDY: What role does trust in God play when it comes to
seeking His help? Nah. 1:7. What about the human experience
contributing to a lack of trust in God? 2 Cor. 1:9; Heb. 3:12. Explain
what trust in God meant to the psalmist (Ps. 48:5-9). Also read Educa-
tion, pp. 253-256.
   There is no limit to what we may accomplish when we go forward
with full confidence in God and complete reliance on His strength.
Read Philippians 4:13. Paul was well aware of his own weaknesses.
But he also was acquainted with God's infinite strength that was
placed at his disposal.

   "God will do great things for those who trust in Him. The reason
why His professed people have no greater strength, is that they trust so
much to their own wisdom, and do not give the Lord an opportunity to
reveal His power in their behalf. He will help His believing children in
every emergency, if they will place their entire confidence in Him,
and faithfully obey Him."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 493.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Is trust in God important for the things of earth, as well as
     for the things of heaven? Explain. If we lack trust in God,
     how may we secure it? Explain the relationship between
     trust in God and obedience to His commands.

   2. How are we to understand the purposes of God in some-
      times providing protection and sometimes withholding it?

   3. For one who desires guidance by God, what is the relation-
      ship between the Scriptures and the still, small voice of the
      Holy Spirit?

SUMMARY: Trust in God lies at the heart of all we have studied this
week. God wants to provide us with every type of assistance in our
battle with the enemy and in our growth as His sons and daughters.
But it is clear that unless we are walking in the path of obedience and
trust, most of God's help will be unavailable to us.
   God has the power to help. He is willing to help. But His sover-
eignty ends where a rebel's sovereignty begins. If we are rebels, He
can give us no more help, no more protection, than He provides for all
inhabitants of our wayward world. But the moment we step under His
banner, claiming Him our Commander, He accepts the gift of our
sovereignty and begins to work in us to will and to do His good
pleasure. It is His pleasure to care for us, protect us, and guide us. He
will be our God of help.

                       Apricots for Souls
                             J. H. Zachary

   God works mightily through people who put their trust in Him.
   Alexander Butoy escaped from Communist Romania and journeyed
through Italy and Brazil, finally settling in Southern California.
   When Communism collapsed in Romania, Butoy prayed for a
way to share his love for God with the people of Mari, his home
village. In 1992 he returned to Mari, taking 50 Bibles with him.
When he arrived he discovered that not one home had a Bible! He
traveled to Bucharest to buy 105 more Bibles, so each home would
have one.
    While in Mari, two men from Veda, a neighboring village,
came to see Butoy. "Please bring Bibles to our village too," they
pleaded. Butoy promised to help them, but he had no more money.
    He returned to California, praying that God would answer the
prayers of these spiritually hungry people. He visited two of his
cousins whose ancestral home was Veda and challenged them to
help provide Bibles for their village. A few months later Butoy and
his cousins returned to Veda with Bibles for every family.
    While visiting the homes, they met the Orthodox priest. He
thanked the men for providing the Bibles. "I cannot attend your
meetings," he said. "But I encourage my people to attend. It is all
right with me if half of the town becomes Adventists!" the priest
told his surprised visitors.
    Butoy wanted to provide Bibles for six additional villages in
 Romania. He asked The Quiet Hour and several churches to help
 him provide 2,500 Bibles.
    Then some of the people who had received Bibles asked for
 help to understand the Word of God better. But Butoy had no
 money to support lay Bible teachers in the villages. Again he asked
 God to provide for this outreach.
    Butoy saw his three apricot trees in full bloom. He knelt under
 one of the trees and dedicated it to the Lord. "I will sell the apricots
 from this tree to finance lay workers in Romania," he promised
 God. The apricot tree he had dedicated to God produced twice as
 much fruit as the other two trees. The funds from the apricots paid
 for several lay workers to teach the people in Mari and the sur-
 rounding villages. Today there is a company of believers in each of
 these villages.

  J. H. Zachary is international evangelism coordinator for The Quiet
Hour.

Lesson 13                                          December 19-25

                 King of Kings




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Ps. 24:7, 8; Isa. 32:1; 33:22;
Dan. 2:44; 1 Tim. 1:17; Rev. 5:12, 13.

   MEMORY TEXT: "But the Lord is the true God; He is the
   living God and the everlasting King. At His wrath the earth will
   tremble, and the nations will not be able to abide His indigna-
   tion" (Jeremiah 10:10, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Some day soon the entire universe will joyfully
celebrate the final victory of our glorious King of kings and the
inauguration of the eternal reign of righteousness.

   OUR WONDERFUL GOD IS PICTURED IN SCRIPTURE AS
A KING. In these days, there are not many kings. We might well,
therefore, review the responsibilities of a king in order to see clearly
some of the functions of our God.
   Kings, in the days when the Bible was written, were sovereign in
their land. In the same manner, God has sole authority. We are to obey
His commands. He gives direction to every movement and policy.
   Some kings have been arbitrary in their judgments, even wicked in
their intentions. David was far from perfect. (Remember the way he
treated Uriah, 2 Samuel 11.) By contrast, our God is a righteous king.
   Some kings have contributed very little, if anything, to the great-
ness of their nation. They have been mere figureheads. But this is far
from true of our God, whom we can call the King of glory.
   Some kings have had to fight for their kingdom and failed. Our God
is a king who is engaged in a battle for the truth. And His victory is
assured. In this lesson, we look at our God as King of kings.

THE LORD IS KING (Isa. 33:22).

  What is God's four-point job description according to Isaiah 33:22?

  1.

  2.

  3.

   4.

   This multifaceted aspect of the responsibilities of a king is not true
of many, if any, kings today. Most rulers have checks placed on their
powers. This seems to be necessary because of the limitations of any
person. But the Lord who is our King is able, and He functions in
these, as well as other ways.

   How did Abraham expect that the Judge of all the earth should
act? Gen. 18:25.


   Note that it would be an injustice for the righteous to suffer with
the wicked. Note also that the wicked can be given extra grace be-
cause of the presence of a few righteous people. Have you thought
that, when you are fully surrendered to God and obedient to Him, your
neighbors profit from your presence among them?
   God is not interested in condemning the world and destroying it (John
3:17). But when people refuse to accept God's mercy, then
punishment is inevitable. God sometimes has to do things He does not
like to do. His heart "churns within" Him as He cries: "How can I give
you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel?" Hos. 11:8, NKJV.

   What is the relation between judging one another and the law
of God? James 4:11, 12.


   A king could also be a savior to his people. He could protect them
from their enemies. Not all kings were always capable of this. But our
God is a king who will never fail to save those who come in submis-
sion to Him.

     What is the relationship of law to Saviour as far as human-
 kind is concerned? How does that relationship affect your daily
 life and spiritual growth?

                                                                    105

KING ETERNAL (1 Tim. 1:17).

   List the four characteristics of God that Paul mentions in
1 Timothy 1:17.

  Contrasted with the wages of death, what is the gift of God?
Rom. 6:23. What is the significance of the words wages and gift
used in this context?


   Life is a very precious commodity. God desires that we shall have it
abundantly (John 10:10). He is the only source of life (John 11:25). The
knowledge of God leads to life eternal (John 17:3). It is very fitting,
therefore, that our God should be represented as an eternal king.
   The concept of eternal kingship rules out the possibility of
unwelcome change or an order passing away. It speaks of stability and
continuity, that which creates trust.
   David writes in Psalm 145:13 that God's kingdom is an everlasting
one and that His "dominion endures through all generations" (NIV).
Thus we know that God's kingly authority governs all time and space.
In other words, He is the sole ruler of the universe, and as such,
demands our compliance and worship.
   In Malachi 3:6, God says, " the Lord do not change " (NIV).
Because God remains eternally the same, we have the assured hope
that He will fulfill His promises.
   By contrast, we can see how fickle people are. Laban deceived
Jacob and changed his wages ten times (Gen. 31:7). We cannot put our
trust even in princes. We can never be certain of anything in this life,
particularly riches (1 Tim. 6:17). We can only be certain that God is
ruling heaven, that all things are in His control, and that we are under
His care if we put our trust in Him. "We need to have far less
confidence in what man can do and far more confidence in what God
can do for every believing soul."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 146.

    Think of at least three or four ways you can express loyalty to
 your Eternal King. Plan to follow through with these expres-
 sions every day of the week.

  KING OF GLORY (Ps. 24:7, 8).

  What question and answer do we find in Psalm 24:7, 8?

  Question

  Answer

   Explain how God displayed His glory to Moses in Exodus 33:18,
19. What implications does this have for Paul's counsel to "do all
to the glory of God"? (1 Cor. 10:31, KJV).


    God's glory is seen in His gracious character. Some people think
glory is an outward manifestation of light, a display of riches and
power. But God's glory has to do with His inner being. What He is
makes Him glorious. God made all His goodness pass before Moses.
"The glory reflected in the countenance of Moses illustrates the
blessings to be received by God's commandment-keeping people through
the mediation of Christ. It testifies that the closer our communion with
God, and the clearer our knowledge of His requirements, the more
fully shall we be conformed to the divine image, and the more readily
do we become partakers of the divine nature."—Patriarchs and Prophets,
p. 330.
    Jesus pointed out the difference between an inner glory and one
that is "put on" when He contrasted the lily of the field with Solomon
and all his finery. If we want to reflect the glory of God in our lives,
we need to allow Him to remake us. (See Ezek. 36:26, 27.) First
Corinthians 13 and Galatians 5:13-26 elaborate on the goodness of
God that we ourselves are to display.
    God's glory is seen not only in His goodness and mercy. It is seen
also in the conflict with evil. When sin first entered heaven, God was
all good in pleading with Lucifer and his angels. But the time came
when there could be no room for rebellion in heaven. A war broke out
in which Michael and His angels fought against the dragon and his
angels. (See Rev. 12:7-9.) Then there was the struggle on the cross,
when it seemed as if Satan had gained the victory. But with the
 resurrection, God was vindicated. Truth will always triumph over evil.
 The King of glory is "mighty in battle." His strength is ours to claim.

    Meditate upon your relationship with friends, family, and
 co-workers. How could God's goodness improve these relation-
 ships? How could your being made anew in the image of His
 goodness change some of the uncomfortable situations in which
 you now find yourself?

                                                                   107

FINAL VICTORY (Dan. 2:44; Rev. 22:20).

   Summarize what Daniel 2:44 tells about the future of earthly
kingdoms and God's kingdom.
   Earthly kingdoms
   God's kingdom

   The time is coming when God can stand no more delay. Everyone
will have decided which side of the conflict she or he is taking, and
God will destroy the wicked and vindicate the righteous.

  Who does Daniel, in another vision, state are the final victims?
Dan. 7:27.


  What does God say about when this final victory will occur?
Rev. 22:20.


    Jesus told His disciples to watch for the signs of His coming (Matt.
24:42). We know we are living in the last days, because the prophecies
have almost all been fulfilled. It is not for us to know the time of His
coming (Acts 1:7). But we are to be ready, since it will be unexpected
(Matt. 24:44).
    While we look forward to sharing in the victory which the King of
glory will win over Satan, we ought to feel deep concern for the millions
of unreclaimed sinners for whom that victory will mean eternal death.
    "Again I appeal to the members of the church to be Christians, to be
Christlike. Jesus was a worker, not for Himself, but for others. He
labored to bless and save the lost. If you are Christians you will imitate
His example. He has laid the foundation, and we are builders together
with Him. But what material are we bringing to lay on this foundation?
`Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it,
because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's
work of what sort it is.' If you are devoting all your strength and talent to
the things of this world, your lifework is represented by wood, hay, and
stubble, to be consumed by the fires of the last day. But unselfish labor
for Christ and the future life will be as gold, silver, and precious stones; it
is imperishable."—Testimonies, for the Church, vol. 5, p. 466.

   Examine your work for the Lord. What materials are you
 bringing to lay on the foundation He has laid? Pray that with
 His help you will better imitate His example.

A REIGN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS (Isa. 32:1).

  What two words does Isaiah use to describe how God will rule
His eternal kingdom? Isa. 32:1.


   "Reign in righteousness. Isaiah turns from the imminent Assyrian
attack on Jerusalem (ch. 31:8, 9) to the time of peace that was to
follow. . . . In a similar way the overthrow of all the forces of Satan
will be followed by Christ's eternal reign in righteousness and glory.
As usual, the prophetic picture of peace and security following upon
tribulation blends into a description of the glories of the world to
come, the Messianic age. In this Messianic setting the 'king' is Christ."
—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 224.

  What wonderful things will God's people experience as He
begins this reign?


   Rev. 19:6, 7

   Rev. 21:4

   Isa. 25.9

   Being saved is a goal that some of us hardly feel possible. Paul felt
that he was the chief of sinners (1 Tim. 1:15). But God's grace is
abundant (verse 14). Joshua the high priest was a "brand plucked out
of the fire" (Zech. 3:2, KJV). But God had made every provision for
him. Thus it will be with us. And we shall rejoice that God has saved
us in spite of our weaknesses.
   It can be our privilege to live during the Lord's eternal reign only
because of God's forgiveness. God is eager for us to live in His
kingdom. Jesus has extended a gracious invitation (John 14:1-3). John
the revelator had a glimpse of the earth made new and recorded the
invitation of the Spirit (Rev. 22:17). Paul says that the suffering we
may have in this world is no hindrance to us when we consider future
glory (Rom. 8:18, 19). We must learn to set our minds on the things
above, not on the things around us.

    What are some of the things you look forward to when God
 sets up His kingdom, and why? What spiritual impact does
 contemplating the wonderful things God has prepared for us
 have on our challenging daily existence?


                                                                    109
Friday                                             December 25
FURTHER STUDY: Read Revelation 5:12, 13. Jesus is our worthy
King. The scene is His final coronation. He had occupied the throne
with God before the fall of Adam and Eve. But He had given it up
when He came to earth as a human to give up His life for our
salvation. Now Jesus is to reign again as Lord over all the universe.
And all the universe is there to witness His coronation. As Christ is
crowned King of kings and Lord of lords—as He is given a name
"above every name"—all, both good and evil, bow in homage before
Him. Why is Christ worthy of the highest honors that can be bestowed
upon Him? Rev. 5:9, 10. Also read The Desire of Ages, pp. 832-835.

   "Every question of truth and error in the long-standing controversy
has now been made plain. The results of rebellion, the fruits of setting
aside the divine statutes, have been laid open to the view of all created
intelligences. . . . Satan's own works have condemned him. . . .
   "Before the universe has been clearly presented the great sacrifice
made by the Father and the Son in man's behalf. The hour has come
when Christ occupies His rightful position and is glorified above
principalities and powers and every name that is named. . . . And the
song of praise ascends from the white-robed ones about the throne:
[Rev. 5:12 quoted]."—The Great Controversy, pp. 670, 671.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Which of the following aspects of God and His govern-
     ment are subject to change, and which are changeless?
     Why? His methods; His nature; His character; His plans;
     His law; His love. Explain your answers.

   2. Why has God delayed His final victory? Why has He al-
      lowed the reign of sin to continue yet a little longer?

SUMMARY: Throughout this quarter, we have learned much about
God. At times we have trembled to think of His power and majesty. At
other times we have rejoiced that every atom in the universe is under
His direction. As we have encountered His call for obedience and
justice, we also have come to know Him as a God of mercy and peace.
Our divine Father combines the traits of strength and love, transcen-
dence and personal friendship. Can all these characteristics really
exist in one Person? They can, and they do. They exist in our King of
kings. Today, as you celebrate His birth, invite Him again to reign in
your heart.

                         Taking Inventory
                         Robert S. Folkenberg


    Year end is inventory time, a time to evaluate progress and lay
plans for the future. As Christians we need to conduct a spiritual
inventory, to evaluate our personal spiritual growth. But what
questions does a Christian answer during this personal inventory?
Here are some suggestions: What is my highest priority? How do I
define success? Does God define it the same way? Where do I
spend my time? What topic most stimulates my interest?
    Ellen White suggested an answer. "We should not make self the
center, and indulge anxiety and fear as to whether we shall be
saved. . . . Commit the keeping of your soul to God, and trust in Him. Talk
and think of Jesus. Let self be lost in Him."—Steps to Christ, p. 71.
    As a practical example, let me share with you the words penned
by a young Christian pastor in Zimbabwe that were found in his
office shortly after he was martyred for his faith.
    "I'm part of the fellowship of the unashamed. I have the Holy
Spirit power. The die has been cast. I have stepped over the line.
The decision has been made—I'm a disciple of His. I won't look
back, let up, slow down, back away, or be still. My past is re-
deemed, my present makes sense, my future is secure. I'm finished
with low living, sight walking, smooth knees, colorless dreams,
tamed visions, worldly talking, cheap giving, and dwarfed goals.
    "I no longer need preeminence, prosperity, position, promo-
tions, plaudits, or popularity. I don't have to be right, first, tops,
recognized, praised, regarded, or rewarded. I now live by faith,
lean in His presence, walk by patience, am uplifted by prayer, and
I labor with power.
    "My face is set, my gait is fast, my goal is heaven, my road is
narrow, my way rough, my companions are few, my guide reliable,
my mission clear. I cannot be bought, compromised, detoured, lured
away, turned back, deluded, or delayed. I will not flinch in the face of
sacrifice, hesitate in the presence of the enemy, pander at the pool of
 popularity, or meander in the maze of mediocrity.
    "I won't give up, shut up, let up, until I have stayed up, stored
 up, prayed up, paid up, preached up for the cause of Christ. I am a
 disciple of Jesus. I must go till He comes, give till I drop, preach till
 all know, and work till He stops me. And, when He comes for His
 own, He will have no problem recognizing me . . . my banner will
 be clear!"—Brennan Manning, The Signature of Jesus.
