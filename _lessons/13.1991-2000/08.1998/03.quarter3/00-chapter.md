                     2 Corinthians
               A Call to Christian Ministry

    As we glance back at our study during the first quarter of this
year, we recall that 1 Corinthians gives us access to the ground floor
of Christianity. We see Christianity as it grows, thrives, and spreads.
We see the gospel making inroads into one of the great cities of the
ancient world. In 1 Corinthians, Paul tries to equip early Christian
disciples to live the gospel in the sophisticated culture of Corinth.
He longs for his correspondents to establish a firm self-identity as
Christians, one that will stand the onslaught of social pressure.
    As we study 2 Corinthians this quarter, we see also Paul's rea-
soned arguments and enthusiasm for the gospel. All these things are
present in his Second Epistle to the Corinthians. But we also find
something more. We find what is perhaps Paul's most personal
letter. Here we see him not only courageous and triumphant but
deeply concerned and personally threatened. In 1 Corinthians we
learn about conditions in Corinth; in 2 Corinthians we learn about
conditions in Paul.
    While reading this letter, it is tempting to feel disconnected from
it. After all, Paul's disagreements with the Corinthians and discus-
sions about the legitimacy of his apostleship are hardly front-page
news today.
    On second thought, though, the letter is all about ministry. And if
we as Seventh-day Adventists are to fulfill the commission to take
"this gospel of the kingdom" into "all the world," we surely need to
study it with care.
    From Paul's experiences as he records them in his second letter to
the church in Corinth, we may learn the following about how to
improve each of our own personal ministries:
1. What it means to minister on Christ's behalf;
2. How to create a personal ministry based on the Cross of Christ
    and His resurrection;
3. What the true qualities of an effective ministry are; and
4. How our weaknesses can become the genius of our ministry.
     To outline 2 Corinthians in such a way may seem to miss much of
the excitement that pulses through its pages. But as you study and
 learn from this outline, Paul and his emotions will become real and
 meaningful. You will begin to sense his drive and relate to his
 mission. You will, indeed, find yourself enlisting on Paul's mission-
 ary team, eager for the joys and sorrows of the most exciting and
 demanding challenge ever to face a human being—Christian
 ministry.

Sabbath Afternoon

READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Cor. 1:1-2:4. Also read all
of 2 Corinthians through in one sitting. As you do, look for its
major themes.

     MEMORY TEXT: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord
     Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who
     comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to
     comfort those who are in any trouble, with the comfort with
     which we ourselves are comforted by God" (2 Corinthians
     1:3, 4, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: God does not give us His Spirit for selfish use.
We are not to enjoy this blessing privately. We are to pass it along to
others.

   GOD WANTS TO EQUIP US TO MINISTER TO OTHERS.
Are the things that happen to us—good and bad—meaningless? In this
week's lesson, Paul describes a crisis and how God made use of it in
his experience. We learn from Paul's experience that each of us is
gifted and anointed for ministry. Through the wonders of God's grace,
the trials that come our way may become part of our training for
service. Pain and hardship may be worked into the school of God's
grace. Crises that Satan designs for our undoing become part of our
retooling so we may become better equipped to minister to others. As
you study this week's lesson, ask yourself how the difficulties you are
dealing with can help you lead others to Jesus.

Sunday                                                   June 28
DIVINE CONSOLATION, DIVINE COMMISSION (2 Cor. 1:1-7).

  Who joins Paul in writing 2 Corinthians? To whom do they
address the letter? 2 Cor. 1:1.


   Just as Paul had someone join with him in sending 1 Corinthians
(1 Cor. 1:1), so he has someone join with him in sending the letter of
2 Corinthians. While the letter is addressed to the church in Corinth,
Paul has a wider audience in view—"all the saints throughout Achaia,"
NIV. Achaia was a province of the Roman Empire. Corinth was its
capital. Much of the letter focuses on the relationship between Paul
and the Corinthian believers. But including this wider audience invites
us to think about its significance for our own time.

   Describe the relationship between suffering and consolation in
the Christian's life. 2 Cor. 1:3-7.


    Paul gives us one of the best pictures of God in all Scripture when
he calls Him "the Father of mercies and the God of all consolation"
(2 Cor. 1:3, NRSV). This picture is of a God who carefully tends the
lives of His saints, making sure their affliction is met with consola-
tion. Such attention on God's part is for a purpose—to help us share
God's consolation with others who suffer (verse 4).
   "Not only does Christ know every soul, and the peculiar needs and
trials of that soul, but He knows all the circumstances that chafe and
perplex the spirit. His hand is outstretched in pitying tenderness to
every suffering child."—Ministry of Healing, p. 249.

  What hope does the passage offer when we feel we are experi-
encing more affliction than consolation? 2 Cor. 1:7.


   Paul gives an example of unshaken hope in those times when
affliction seems greater than consolation. We also may learn some-
thing from the attitude of this introduction. Rather than presenting a
mournful request, Paul praises God for a generous supply of comfort.
How would it affect our Christian experience if we adopted Paul's
attitude of praise?

    Think of someone you know who needs to experience the
 comfort of God. Today or tomorrow, share with that person a
 time when God was for you "the Father of mercies and the God
 of all consolation."

                                                                     7
Monday                                                      June 29
CRISIS IN ASIA (2 Cor. 1:8-11).

   What divine purpose did Paul come to understand in the crisis
he describes in 2 Corinthians 1:8-11?


   Paul refers to events that occurred in the Roman province of Asia.
Because Paul spent three years of his third missionary journey in
Ephesus, the capital and most important city of the province, the
events most likely happened there. It is difficult to say exactly what
happened. But we can be sure his readers knew. Some Bible scholars
think the crisis may have been a grave illness, an unrecorded impris-
onment, or the persecution caused by the silversmiths (Acts
19:23-41).

     List three elements Paul mentions about this crisis.

     2 Cor. 1:8, 9

     verse 10, first half

     verse 10, second half

   Now list some of the emotions Paul must have felt during this
crisis.


    Reviewing the major events in the relationship between Paul and
the Corinthian Christians helps to show how 2 Corinthians contributes
to that relationship:
1. Paul establishes the church in Corinth during his second
    missionary journey (Acts 18:1-17).
2. Paul sends a "previous" letter to Corinth from Ephesus (1 Cor.
   5:9-11).
3. The Corinthians reply with more questions for Paul to help them
   with practical issues confronting them (7:1).
4. Paul writes 1 Corinthians from Ephesus telling them about the
   opportunities and obstacles before him (16:8).
   This list is completed in Tuesday's lesson.

  Remember a time you sensed your dependence upon God.
Did you feel any of the emotions Paul must have felt? Take a
moment now to thank God for His guidance and to recommit
your life to Him.

A PAINFUL VISIT (2 Cor. 1:12-2:4).

   How and why had Paul's travel plans changed? 2 Cor. 1:12-2:4.


   In Monday's lesson, we began to list major events in the relation-
ship between Paul and the Corinthians. The next events help us put
Paul's changed plans in their context:
5. Paul pays the Corinthians a brief and "painful" visit (2 Cor. 2:1)
   during which someone attacks him (2:5; 7:12) and he fails to
   receive support from the believers in Corinth (2:3). In reporting his
   changed travel plans, Paul refers to this uncomfortable encounter
   (1:12-2:4).
6. In view of the events of the "painful" visit, Paul writes a
   "severe" letter of reprimand to the Corinthians from Ephesus
   (2:3, 4, 9; 7:8).
7. After receiving word from Titus of the positive response of the
   Corinthians to his "severe" letter, Paul writes 2 Corinthians, a letter
   of reconciliation that shows his untiring love to them and great
   hope for them (2:13; 7:5-16).
8. Paul pays a third and final visit to Corinth, where he winters before
   going on to Jerusalem via Macedonia with the collection for the
   church there (Acts 20:2, 3).

   Meditate on 2 Corinthians 1:12-14. How may we apply these
verses to our lives today? Think of specific things that bring
rejoicing to your heart. How can things which uplift you bcome a
source of inspiration to draw others to Christ?


   Among the ways we may apply these verses are the following:
   1. They help to develop a hunger in our lives for spiritual "simplic-
      ity" (or "holiness") and "godly sincerity."
   2. They invite self-examination. Paul's "boast" consisted of the
      Corinthian believers in whose lives he had invested. What is
      your "boast"? What achievements of the past year do you in-
      clude in your Christmas letters, for instance? Business success?
      Advanced degrees? Vacations in exotic places? What percent of
      your life really focuses on some sort of ministry to people? Is
      their spiritual advancement of utmost importance to you?

    Paul was motived by the desire to see Jesus return and by a
 longing to prepare as many as possible to meet Him. In what
 ways do you share Paul's motivations?


                                                                        9
Wednesday                                                    July 1
WE ARE THE LORD'S ANOINTED (2 Cor. 1:12-2:4).

   What charges seem to have been made against Paul because of
his changed travel plans? Why do you think Paul felt the need to
give such a detailed explanation? 2 Cor. 1:12-2:4.


   Paul's adjusted schedule caused someone to accuse him of waver-
ing. On the surface, it did appear that he was speaking inconsistently
(verse 17). Paul argues strongly, though, that instead of human indeci-
sion, his experience had been marked by God's anointing (verses 21,
22). He also includes the Corinthian believers as "anointed ones"
when he says, "It is God who establishes us with you in Christ and has
anointed us [that is, all believers]. . . ." (verse 21, NRSV, italics
supplied).

   Compare the description of the Spirit's role in the Christian life
in 2 Corinthians 1:21, 22, with the descriptions in 2 Corinthians
5:5 and Ephesians 1:13, 14; 4:30. Is "the sealing" in these verses
something past, present, or future? Be able to explain your answer.


   Paul repeatedly describes the Holy Spirit as God's "down pay-
ment" and "seal" of acknowledgment that we are His children. The
Greek term for "earnest" (KJV), "first installment" (NRSV), or
"deposit" (NIV) is a commercial term describing the first installment
of a payment or gift put down as a way of guaranteeing that the rest
will follow. Imagine that someone offers you $5,000 for a car you are
selling. You request $500.00 down to hold the car while the buyer
arranges to borrow the rest. How would the buyer feel if, on his or her
return, you demanded the full price. You see, the "earnest money" is
part of the purchase price. "As the Holy Spirit imparts grace and
power to overcome sin, the Christian experiences an 'earnest' of the
complete triumph and victory that will be his upon admission to
heaven."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 834.
    Paul wants us to understand that the Spirit is God's guarantee of
more to come. We can gauge the glories of the age to come by the
Spirit's present work with us.

    "We are 'the Lord's anointed'! United with Christ by the
Spirit, we are saved by him to be his instruments of salva-
tion."—G. R. Beasley-Murray, "2 Corinthians," in The Broadman
Bible Commentary (Nashville, Tenn.: Broadman, 1971), vol. 11,
p. 13. As an instrument of God's salvation, how will you relate to
others differently than you are relating to them now?

2 CORINTHIANS—A GUIDE FOR MINISTRY.

   What is true of the early part of 2 Corinthians is true of the entire
letter—it focuses on Paul's relationship to the Corinthian believers
and his role as apostle. As founding pastor of the Corinthian church,
Paul had a special function to fulfill in nurturing the church there.

   Considering that the letter focuses so much attention on Paul's
relationship as missionary pastor to the church in Corinth, how
can it apply to us?


   "Paul's pastoral position was probably unique, but all Christians
are in some kind of a pastoral situation in relation to others, as parents,
teachers, administrators, executives, supervisors, as working along-
side others and in constant contact with them. All are the keepers of
their brothers and sisters. How then should they care for them? All
Christians are also subject to some kind of pastoral responsibility
exercised over them by others. What should their attitude be to those
who exercise that responsibility?"—Ernest Best, Second Corinthians
(Atlanta, Ga.: John Knox Press, 1987), p. 4.
   We can view 2 Corinthians as a ministry manual. Each of us is a
minister of the gospel to those whom God has placed within our care.

   Refer back to your reading assignment of 2 Corinthians given
at the beginning of this lesson. In the space provided, jot down
ideas that you consider helpful in your service to others.




   How does Paul remind the Corinthians that God has given each
believer a ministry? 1 Cor. 12:4-11; 2 Cor. 5:15.


   "What an admirable Epistle is the second to the Corinthians! How
full of affections! He [Paul] joys, and he is sorry, he grieves, and he
glories, never was there such care of a flock expressed, save in the
great Shepherd of the fold, who first shed tears over Jerusalem, and
afterwards blood."—George Herbert, The Country Parson (New York:
Paulist Press, 1981), p. 63.

    What are you doing to fulfill the ministry God has given to you?

                                                                       11

FURTHER STUDY: "Consolation" or "comfort" (Greek, parakale
[verb]; parakl sis [noun]) is an important word group in 2 Corinthians.
Check the uses in: 2 Cor. 2:8; 5:20; 6:1; 7:4; 8:4, 6, 17; 9:5; 10:1; 12:8,
18. In 2 Corinthians, "consolation" points to "God's fruitful presence
and support in situations of human crisis."—J. Thomas, "parakale," in
Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament, vol. 3,
(Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1993), p. 26.

   "It was through suffering that Jesus obtained the ministry of conso-
lation. In all the affliction of humanity He is afflicted; and 'in that He
Himself hath suffered being tempted, He is able to succor them that
are tempted.' Isaiah 63:9; Hebrews 2:18. In this ministry every soul
that has entered into the fellowship of His sufferings is privileged to
share. 'As the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation
also aboundeth by Christ.' 2 Corinthians 1:5. The Lord has special
grace for the mourner, and its power is to melt hearts, to win souls. His
love opens a channel into the wounded and bruised soul, and becomes
a healing balsam to those who sorrow. 'The Father of mercies, and the
God of all comfort .. . comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may
be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort
wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.' 2 Corinthians
1:3, 4."—Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 13.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. A true story: A young woman, active in her local church,
     discovers she has acquired AIDS through the use of
     intraveneous drugs several years ago. Many people in the
     church responded by "blaming the victim" and distancing
     themselves from her. How might they have become active in
     a "ministry of consolation" instead? Be specific.

   2. On a scale of 1-10, how active is your local congregation or
      Sabbath School class in "consoling the afflicted"? List some
      of the "afflicted" ones in your community/church whom
      you may have ignored. Draw up a plan to minister to two of
      these people on a continuing basis.

   3. How would you react if some members of your church
      began challenging the authority of your pastor? Why?

SUMMARY: In times of difficulty, God brings into our lives the
blessings of His grace. The Spirit comes with divine consolation to
minister hope in the midst of distress and to anoint us for ministry.
Since we have ourselves experienced God's presence in crisis, we are
better able to console others.

                        Sharing the Hope
                            J. H. Zachary

    When Viktor Bechterev lost his wife in 1992, he was devastated.
His atheistic upbringing offered no comfort. In his grief he reached
out for God. He started reading the Bible and, after a difficult begin-
ning, he found comfort from his reading. As he continued reading the
Bible, he felt a strong need to know God better.
    He saw a notice for a Revelation Seminar and decided to attend.
During the seminar he accepted Jesus as his Saviour. Elevantina
Kazak, a widow, also attended the seminar in search of God. The two
decided to begin their new lives in Christ together.
    The couple wanted to share their new faith with others. They
attended a lay training seminar for Global Mission Pioneers, con-
ducted by The Quiet Hour. During the training sessions, they com-
mitted one year of their lives to establish a church in an unentered
city in the Russian Federation. Their assignment was Neftekamsk, a
city in the oil-rich region of the Ural Mountains. The city's residents
were mostly Muslims.
    Viktor and Elevantina arrived in Neftekamsk, eager to work for
God. They met strong resistance; few wanted Bible studies; and five
times they were asked to move from their living quarters. But they
kept praying and visiting. Viktor visited factories, schools, nursing
homes, and kindergartens, offering to present lectures on health and
family life. They continued visitation, and contacted more than 900
persons. Slowly friendships developed, and God opened the way for
Bible studies. What joy was theirs when they saw eight new friends
become brothers and sisters in Jesus Christ!
    A factory where Viktor had lectured offered to let them use an
auditorium for church services. Eight months after Viktor and Elevantina
arrived, a Quiet Hour/Global Mission evangelistic team conducted a
harvest meeting, and 30 persons were baptized.
    Viktor and Elevantina have stayed beyond their one-year commit-
ment to study with 140 interested persons and to nurture the new
 believers. When the new believers are sufficiently grounded in their
 faith, these two pioneers plan to move to another unentered city.
     Viktor and Elevantina rejoice as they share the hope they found
 in Jesus Christ with other lonely, discouraged wanderers. Pray for
 them, and for other Global Mission Pioneers working around the
 world.

  J. H. Zachary is director of evangelism for The Quiet Hour in Redlands,
California.

               The Ministry of
                Forgiveness




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Cor. 2:5-17.

  MEMORY TEXT: "For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I
  have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ,
  lest Satan should take advantage of us; for we are not ignorant
  of his devices" (2 Corinthians 2:11, 12, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: When we extend and receive forgiveness, we
play a major part in the plan of redemption. When we extend and
receive forgiveness, we live daily in a way that shows we stand in
God's presence.

   FORGIVENESS IS A STRATEGIC ISSUE. We have tamed the
words "forgiveness" and "forgiving" by making use of them in a
variety of routine ways. All too often, forgiveness becomes ordinary
and optional, something we extend or withhold at will or refuse to
accept because we would rather be bitter.
   For Paul, however, forgiveness is more a term for the battlefield of
the great controversy. In the battle between good and evil, forgiveness
is a major part of God's strategic battle plan. If Christians fail to
forgive one another, they divide the army of Christ and hand Satan an
advantage. In 2 Corinthians 2:5-17, Paul invites us to recapture the
importance, power, and pathos of "forgiveness." As you study the
lesson this week, decide whether there is anyone you need to forgive.
Then take specific steps to do so.

A TIME TO FORGIVE (2 Cor. 2:5-11).

   What counsel does Paul give the believers concerning the disci-
pline of one of its members? 2 Cor. 2:5-11.


   Paul does not address his letters to make-believe situations. In
2 Corinthians 1:3-7, he has discussed the theme of "consolation" or
"comfort." Then in 2 Corinthians 2:5-11, he discusses a particular
situation where "consolation" is needed (verse 7). A member of the
church in Corinth had caused his fellow church members and Paul
much pain. Paul had, in his "severe letter" (2 Cor. 2:3, 4), recom-
mended "punishment" (verse 6), which the church had carried out.
The outcome reveals that the discipline was not vengeful but loving
and redemptive, leading to repentance and restoration. In Paul's view,
the discipline had done its work. He is now concerned that the erring
member may be "overwhelmed by excessive sorrow" (verse 7, NIV,
NRSV).

   This member is sometimes thought to be the offender of
1 Corinthians, chapter 5. Do you think they are the same person?
Why or why not?

   Paul goes out of his way to help the Corinthian Christians avoid
blaming one individual while withdrawing from any further involve-
ment with the problem. First, the pain inflicted on the victim (in this
instance, Paul) is, in reality, something everyone shares. In the attack
on Paul, all have been wronged. The victim is not to be blamed as
somehow deserving of the ill treatment.
   Second, when discipline has been administered, the results should
be carefully watched. The congregation cannot "wash its hands" of the
situation. Instead, we must be alert to the fresh work of the Spirit in
that person's life, always ready to reaffirm our love for that individual
(verse 8). Forgiveness is never an end in itself. It must lead us to be
kind, supportive, and consoling of the one forgiven.
   "What this man [Paul] preached he practiced, and he was the living
embodiment of the gospel of a forgiving Father who seeks and saves
the lost."—Ralph Martin, 1, 2 Corinthians (Dallas, Tex.: Word, 1988),
p. 51.

    As a Christian parent, pastor, or teacher administering disci-
 pline, how do you know when "enough [discipline] is enough"?
 As you contemplate Paul's wise counsel, in what specific ways
 can you follow his example in applying discipline redemptively?


                                                                     15

FORGIVE ... AS WE FORGIVE (2 Cor. 2:5-10).

   Define forgiveness.


   Forgiveness is one of those common words we use on a daily basis.
As Christians, we usually think of it in two distinct categories:
1. Either it is human in the sense that one person is forgiving another,
2. Or it is divine in that we ask forgiveness from God. But are these
   two categories really that distinct?

   How are divine and human forgiveness related in each of the
following passages?

   2 Cor. 2:5-10

   Matt. 6:9-15

   Matt. 18:15-20

   John 20:19-23

    Some time ago, Lewis Smedes wrote an article titled "Forgiveness:
The Power to Change the Past." In it, Smedes writes, "When you
forgive someone, you slice away the wrong from the person who did
it. You disengage that person from his hurtful act. You recreate him.
At one moment you identify him ineradicably as the person who did
you wrong. The next moment you change that identity. He is remade
in your memory.
    "You think of him now not as the person who hurt you, but as a
person who needs you. You feel him now not as the person who
alienated you, but as the person who belongs to you. Once you branded
him as a person powerful in evil, but now you see him as a person
weak in his needs. You recreated your past by recreating the person
whose wrong made your past painful."—Christianity Today, January
7, 1983, p. 24.

   Have you ever given or received such forgiveness? This week,
why not let Christ's spirit of forgiveness lead you to forgive
someone who wronged you in this manner. Remember, "Let all
bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speak-
ing, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind to
one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God
for Christ's sake hath forgiven you" (Eph. 4:31, 32, KJV).

OUR SCHEMING FOE (2 Cor. 2:11).

  Compare the description of Satan in 2 Corinthians 2:11 with
the descriptions in Ephesians 6:11 and 1 Peter 5:8. What is he
determined to do?


   If the church members in Corinth now forgive the once-offending
member, they may avoid being "taken advantage of" by Satan. In
mistreating one another, we allow Satan a strategic edge, for he uses
our unforgiving spirit to drive offending persons to despair. However,
this need not be, for Paul adds, "We are not unaware of his schemes"
(NIV). In 2 Corinthians, the Greek word translated "schemes" usually
means "mind," "thoughts," or "intentions." (Compare the uses in
2 Cor. 3:14; 4:4; 11:3.) It is always helpful to be able to understand the
thinking of your opponent! And Paul claims that Christians have the
ability to do just that!

  How is Satan referred to elsewhere in 2 Corinthians? What do
we learn of his schemes?

   2 Cor. 4:4

   2 Cor. 6:15

   2 Cor. 11:3, 12-15

    "There is active engagement between the kingdom of Christ and
the kingdom of Satan. If Satan strives to maintain humans in his thrall,
he also attempts to regain those who have been lost to Christ and he
resists Paul, a leading opponent in the battle for human lives."—D. G.
Reid, "Satan," in Dictionary of Paul and His Letters (Downers Grove,
Ill.: InterVarsity Press, 1993), p. 865.
    Second Corinthians 2:11 alerts us to the fact that Satan seeks to
destroy not only our individual Christian experiences but also our
Christian unity. To Paul's list of the divine armor, he adds these
words: "Pray in the Spirit at all times in every prayer and supplication.
To that end keep alert and always persevere in supplication for all the
saints" (Eph. 6:18, NRSV).

   How might Satan be attempting to destroy unity in your
 church through unforgiving attitudes? In what specific ways do
 you plan to counter his subtle attempts? Make this an ongoing
 subject of your prayers.


                                                                       17

LED IN TRIUMPH (2 Cor. 2:12-17).

  How do you explain the conflict Paul faced between the door
being open to evangelism in Troas and the restlessness in his
spirit? How can both exist at the same time? What does this
experience tell us about Paul? 2 Cor. 2:12, 13.


   Having conducted his "painful" visit and sent his "severe" letter,
Paul leaves Ephesus and goes to Troas, where he has an "open door"
in evangelism but no freedom of spirit. Troubled by his relationship
with the Corinthian Christians, he hopes Titus will join him in Troas.
When he does not, Paul goes to Macedonia to meet him there.

   How does Paul respond to Titus's good news from Corinth?
2 Cor. 2:14-17; 7:5-7.


   Paul has portrayed the harsh realities of his ministry in Asia, his
troubled relations with the Corinthians, and his distracted mission in
Troas. He now gives us an image of the joy of being a true ambassador
for Christ. He compares the victory parade of a Roman general to the
victory of Christ over Satan. We, as soldiers of the Cross, are captured
by Christ's love, as trophies of His grace. Then we are appointed to
spread the fragrance of His good news of salvation and proclaim
victory over Satan the enemy.

   What spiritual importance does Paul's use of "always" "in
every place," "in Christ," and "through us" have in spreading the
fragrance of Christ's knowledge? 2 Cor. 2:14. How can you spread
the fragrance of Christ in your home, church, and neighborhood?

   The clouds of sweet-smelling incense announced the Roman general's
victory. As we devote ourselves to Christ and march in His victory
procession, He fills us and our environment with the fragrance of His
love and knowledge. Such spiritual fragrance becomes so much a part
of our experience that others will know we march with Him. Even our
enemies will take notice of the close relationship that exists between
us and Christ, just as the Jewish rulers and elders reacted to the
witness of Peter and John when they marveled and "realized that they
had been with Jesus" (Acts 4:13, NKJV).

   How does the sweet aroma of life to some become the aroma
of death to others? 2 Cor. 2:15, 16. How does accepting or
rejecting the gospel relate to this?

LIVING IN GOD'S PRESENCE (2 Cor. 2:10, 17).

   There is an important theme in 2 Corinthians 2 that can be easy to
miss. It is the idea of being in the presence of Christ (verse 10) or of
standing before God (verse 17).

  As you read 2 Corinthians 2:5-17, try to decide what Paul
means by the idea of Christ's or God's "presence."


   In verse 10, Paul's concern is for the church at Corinth to exercise
forgiveness toward the disciplined and repentant member. To moti-
vate them, Paul tells them he has already done so on their behalf and
"in the sight of Christ" (NIV).
   In verse 17, Paul contrasts the ministry of his missionary group to
that of "so many" whom he regards as "peddlers of God's word"
(NRSV). False charges may have been spreading about Paul's man-
agement of church funds, especially of money intended for poor
members in Jerusalem (2 Cor. 12:14-18). But Paul reassures his read-
ers that he is not seeking to enrich himself. He and his co-workers will
not be tempted to mold their message or dampen their enthusiasm for
personal or financial gain. Instead, they are persons who are both
"sent from God" and "standing in his presence."

   What changes would you make in your life today if you were to
live standing in God's presence?


    We often ask God to be present in our lives. Perhaps we should ask
not so much for God to be present with us but to make us "present"
with Him. "The presence of God is guaranteed to the Christian. This
Rock of faith is the living presence of God. The weakest may depend
upon it. Those who think themselves the strongest may become the
weakest unless they depend on Christ as their efficiency, their worthi-
ness. This is the Rock upon which we may build successfully. God is
near in Christ's atoning sacrifice, in His intercession, His loving,
tender ruling power over the church. Seated by the eternal throne, He
watches them with intense interest."—Sons and Daughters of God,
p. 77.

   Risen Lord, carry me above the cares of the world today.
 Bring me into Your very presence. Bow my mortal form before
 Your eternal throne. Raise me up to join in the angelic songs of
 praise, to stand in Your presence. Allow me to remain there in
 adoration even as You send me forth to minister in Your name.

                                                                     19
Friday                                                   July 10
FURTHER STUDY: How important is the preaching of forgiveness
to the Christian message? Acts 3:17-21; 5:27-32; Matt. 6:12, 14, 15;
18:20-35; Mark 10:25.
   Read The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 323-326.

   "In dealing with the erring, harsh measures should not be resorted
to; milder means will effect far more. Make use of the milder means
most perseveringly, and even if they do not succeed, wait patiently;
never hurry the matter of cutting off a member from the church. Pray
for him, and see if God will not move upon the heart of the erring.
Discipline has been largely perverted. . . . Passion, prejudice, and
partiality, I am sorry to say, have had abundant room for exhibition,
and proper discipline has been strangely neglected. If those who deal
with the erring had hearts full of the milk of human kindness, what a
different spirit would prevail in our churches. May the Lord open the
eyes and soften the hearts of those who have a harsh, unforgiving,
unrelenting spirit toward those whom they think in error. Such men
dishonor their office and dishonor God. They grieve the hearts of His
children, and compel them to cry unto God in their distress. The Lord
will surely hear their cry, and will judge for these things."—Review
and Herald, May 14, 1895.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Gordon D. Marino questions the common notion of "self-
     forgiveness." He believes forgiveness "belongs to the in-
     jured," that it is "a relational act and as such cannot be
     carried out alone." He asks, "Whence comes this notion
     that we can forgive ourselves our own trespasses?"—"The
     Epidemic of Forgiveness," Commonweal, vol. 122, no. 6 (March
     24, 1995), pp. 9-11. In view of this week's lesson, do you
     agree with Marino's perspectives? Why or why not?

  2. A true story: A church treasurer confessed to embezzling a
     large amount of church funds. After he is disciplined, how
     should he be forgiven and reaffirmed? Let 2 Corinthians
     2:6-8 guide your answer.

SUMMARY: Satan seeks to use every situation to bring conflict into
the church. Now that the Corinthian believers have followed Paul's
counsel to discipline an erring member, they may be open to Satan's
tricks by failing to forgive the repentant member. Paul encourages
them (and us) to practice the ministry of forgiveness.

                 The Young Soldier, Part 1
                    Simon Vieira Morase Neto

    I stepped off the bus in suburban Sao Luis, Brazil, and started
toward my home. I had gone to the church office to pick up two
Bibles to take to the evangelistic meeting that night. As I walked
along the street, I sensed that someone was following me. I glanced
behind me and saw a young man who had been on the same bus as
I. I walked a little faster, but the young man walked faster as well.
Soon he caught up with me.
    "Excuse me," he said. "Are you an Adventist?"
    Surprised, I stammered, "Yes. Why?"
    "When I saw you in the bus, I noticed you had a Bible," he said.
"I thought you must be an Adventist. I am looking for a Seventh-
day Adventist church."
    "How do you know about Adventists?" I questioned, still amazed
at our encounter.
    "My father is in the military. He has studied the Bible faith-
fully. He found verses in the Bible that commanded people to
worship on the Sabbath. There were no Sabbath keepers in our
area, so Father sometimes held meetings in our home on the
Sabbath. When I learned that I would come to Sao Luis to attend
military school, Father challenged me to find an Adventist church
and learn more about what they believe."
    It started to rain, so we stepped under a shelter to continue our
discussion.
    "How does your father know about Adventists if there are none
where you live?" I asked, now intensely curious.
    "My aunt and my father often discussed religion, and once she
told him, 'You're always talking about the Sabbath. You sound
 like a Seventh-day Adventist!' This is how we knew the Adventist
 church believed in the Sabbath. I also like to study the Bible, but
 as I saw what other churches teach, I began to wonder if there is
 any church that practices all that the Bible teaches."
     I invited the young man, Sidraque, to the evangelistic meeting
 at the church that night, and he eagerly accepted. I gave him the
 church address and took his address, so I could visit him if he did
 not come that night. Then we parted. As I hurried on home, I had a
 strong feeling that the Lord wanted this young man to be a soldier,
 but not in the Brazilian army.

             How to Have a
          Life-giving Ministry




Sabbath Afternoon

READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Cor. 3:1-18.

   MEMORY TEXT: "But we all, with open face beholding as in a
   glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image
   from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord"
   (2 Corinthians 3:18, KJV).

  KEY THOUGHT: Our relationships with others should mirror
God's gracious, transforming covenant with His people.

    WHO CARES? After the editor of a famous news magazine climbed
a 23,000-foot peak in the Andes, he commented that the mountain
could have cared less about his accomplishments in life. (James M.
Wall, "A Graduation Speech: Failure and Forgiveness," The Christian
Century, June 1, 1994, pp. 555, 556.) But some who stand before the
mountain of the Lord love to brag about their achievements. And what
is true of the Andes is true also of Sinai. It could care less.
    Paul wishes his readers to know that his work involves a "new
covenant" ministry of life in the Spirit. He does not come waving his
credentials. His work is not a ministry of death and condemnation but
of life and salvation. Paul invites us to contemplate the ministry God
has entrusted to each one of us. As you study this week's lesson, ask
yourself, How am I allowing God to minister His life in the Spirit
through me? How am I allowing Him to help me lead others from a
life of condemnation to a ministry of salvation?

LIVING LETTERS (2 Cor. 3:1-3).

  Recall a time when you wrote a letter of recommendation or
had one written on your behalf. What was its purpose? Was it
honest? Did it accomplish its goal?


   Letters of recommendation played an important part in early Chris-
tianity. Philemon and 3 John are two such letters. (You may wish to
read one of them to get a feel for this type of letter.) Though today
they may be sent by electronic mail or fax machine rather than written
on papyrus, letters of recommendation continue to play an important
role in our lives.

  How does Paul use the custom of writing letters of recommen-
dation to discuss his relationship to the Corinthians? 2 Cor. 3:1-3.


   Demetrius, an ancient author who describes how to write letters,
provides a model letter of recommendation: "So and so, who is con-
veying this letter to you, has been tested by us and is loved on account
of his trustworthiness. You will do well if you deem him worthy of
hospitality both for my sake and his, and indeed for your own. For you
will not be sorry if you entrust to him, in any matter you wish, either
words or deeds of a confidential nature. Indeed, you, too, will praise
him to others when you see how useful he can be in everything."—As
translated in Stanley K. Stowers, Letter Writing in Greco-Roman
Antiquity (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1986), p. 154.
   In an age of traveling teachers, there was a need to carry letters to
prove one's character. Paul, who established the church at Corinth and
knows its members well, suggests, tongue-in-cheek, the idea that he
bring them such letters of reference on his next visit. This idea gives
Paul a chance to make his point—the Corinthian Christians are them-
selves all the letter of recommendation he needs. They are a "letter of
Christ" that Paul and his companions have helped to compose.
   "The world has need of more legible Christians. The language of a
Christlike life is intended for all mankind. Only thus can men compre-
hend what Christianity means, understand its great truths, and learn to
love and obey God's law."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, pp. 843,
844.

   How well can others "read" Christ in you? Examine your
 own life to determine whether you are a "letter from Christ." In
 what specific ways can you invite Christ to write His letter on
 your heart?

THE OLDEST COVENANT OF ALL (2 Cor. 3:4-18).

   What are the characteristics of the "new" covenant? How old is
it? 2 Cor. 3:4-18; Jer. 31:31-34; Eph. 1:3-6; Deut. 9:1-6.


   God has always invited His people to accept a covenant based on
grace. Such a covenant, prepared by the Godhead before Creation,
was offered to Adam and Eve (Gen. 3:15), to Noah (Gen. 6:18; 9:8-
17), to Abraham (Gen. 15:7, 18-21), and to the children of Israel at
Sinai (Exod. 19, 20). The covenant at Sinai "is of just as much force
today as it was when the Lord made it with ancient Israel."—Ellen G.
White, The Southern Watchman, March 1, 1904, p. 142. From God's
point of view, the covenant at Sinai was an expression of His eternal
covenant of grace offered to humankind.
   "From the perspective of the New Testament, the covenant that
God initiates in the ministry of Jesus is "new" because: (1) Christ's
death ratified it; (2) Israel so lost sight of God's everlasting covenant
of grace that His work in Christ appears "new"; (3) God's revelation
in Christ helps us to understand God better".—Adapted from Edward
Heppenstall, "The Covenants and the Law," in Our Firm Foundation,
vol. 1, pp. 455-457.

   List and define the characteristics of the "old" covenant. 2 Cor.
3:4-18.


    From the human side, the Sinai covenant became marked by fruit-
less attempts at external obedience, a dependence on man's unaided
"works of law" rather than the response of faith. From this human
side, then, the covenant at Sinai may be called the "old covenant."
    "Seventh-day Adventists have held that the law of God has been at
the heart of the controversy from the very beginning; that the Chris-
tian Era is pre-eminently the age when the law of God .. . is to be kept
as never before, not as the means of salvation, but as the fruit of a life
that is hid with Christ in God. We further believe that there never was
a time when men were saved by law; that the covenant of grace was
established from before the foundation of the world; that all men are
saved by grace alone."—Heppenstall, p. 438.

    What kind of covenant relationship are you experiencing
 with God? What difference does it make in your life? What
 specific things do you plan to do, by His grace, to strengthen this
 covenant relationship?

NEW COVENANT MINISTRY (2 Cor. 3:4-11).

  In 2 Corinthians 3:4-11, Paul compares the "new covenant"
ministry, which he and his companions exercise, to "old covenant"
ministry. The chart below illustrates this contrast. Fill in the
missing sections.
    Old Covenant Ministry                New Covenant Ministry

Of the letter that kills (verse 6)
                                     Ministry of the Spirit (verse 8)

(verses 7, 9-11)
                                     Lasts, is permanent (verse 11)

   Apparently, Paul had in mind some people whose "old covenant"
ministry contrasted with his "new covenant" approach. Later, Paul
will refer to these opponents as "false apostles" who are actually
Satan's partners (2 Cor. 11:5, 13-15). They boasted of their Jewish
credentials (11:22) and compared their possession of letters of recom-
mendation (perhaps from the church in Jerusalem) to Paul's lack of
such credentials (3:1-3).
   We must keep in mind that when Paul refers to the "old covenant,"
he is considering its misapplication by the Jewish nation and the
Judaizers of his day. There is nothing wrong with the letter of the law,
for God Himself wrote it on tablets of stone. However, it must not
only remain in stone but it must also be inscribed in the human heart.
Otherwise it becomes a set of lifeless rules and regulations to secure
external conformity.
    God intended that the ministry of the letter of the law and its spirit
go hand in hand. He did not intend one to exclude the other. The law
contains the record of His revealed will, which must be realized in the
life of believers by the power of the Holy Spirit. Thus what is recorded
in Jeremiah becomes a living reality: "I will put my law in their minds,
and write it on their hearts" (31:33). Even Jesus' teaching can become
lifeless unless we allow the Holy Spirit to make it a transforming
experience. Our spiritual life must always be anchored in "thus says
the Lord" and "it is written."

   How has your ministry brought life and glory to those in your
 care? What might you be doing that stifles others' spiritual life
 and wilts their courage?

                                                                        25

THE UNVEILING (2 Cor. 3:12-18).

  Why did Moses put a veil over his face? Exod. 34:29-35. How
does Paul interpret this event? 2 Cor. 3:7-16.


   Paul sees this same veil as still dimming the sight of most of his
fellow Jews. They neither find Christ in the Old Testament nor accept
the message that He is the Messiah. Paul may well be suggesting that
the veil has not fully slipped from the minds of some Jewish Chris-
tians, especially from the minds of those who oppose him at Corinth.

   How did the Old Testament become a "new" book for some
early converts to Christianity? Luke 24:27, 32, 44-49; Acts
9:17-22.


    Paul's statement that "when one turns to the Lord, the veil is
removed" (2 Cor. 3:16, NRSV) refers to Exodus 34:34: "But when-
ever Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him, he would take
the veil off." Paul sees the experience of Moses in the life of the
Christian convert. In turning to "the Lord" Jesus Christ, the veil is
lifted, and the very words once read as excluding Christian claims
become testimony to them.
    This truth had been active in Paul's own conversion: "During the
long hours when Saul was shut in with God alone, he recalled many of
the passages of Scripture referring to the first advent of Christ. Care-
fully he traced down the prophecies, with a memory sharpened by the
conviction that had taken possession of his mind. As he reflected on
the meaning of these prophecies, he was astonished at his former
blindness of understanding and at the blindness of the Jews in general,
which had led to the rejection of Jesus as the promised Messiah. To his
enlightened vision, all now seemed plain. He knew that his former
prejudice and unbelief had clouded his spiritual perception and had
prevented him from discerning in Jesus of Nazareth the Messiah of
prophecy.
   "As Saul yielded himself fully to the convicting power of the Holy
Spirit, he saw the mistakes of his life and recognized the far-reaching
claims of the law of God. He who had been a proud Pharisee, . . . now
bowed before God with the humility and simplicity of a little child."
—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 119.

beyond hope of enlightenment. Write a prayer that the miracle
described in this passage will be true for them.

CHANGED INTO HIS LIKENESS (2 Cor. 3:18).

   Read Paul's hopeful conclusion to this paragraph, verse 18, in
different translations. What does it say to you?




   Second Corinthians 3:18 says that Christians are transformed
into the "image" of Christ. How does Paul express similar thoughts
in Colossian 3:9, 10 and Romans 8:29, 30?


   Paul's description of the Christian's privileges could strike us as
bad news. Because the reality of our individual Christian experience
sometimes differs noticeably from Paul's joyful account of the Chris-
tian walk, we might tend to reject his enthusiasm. We should note that
his sketch of Christian privileges includes these thoughts:
1. Paul clearly regards this to be good news. His conclusion is a
   positive, upbeat promise. "The power of the Spirit is the power that
   raised Jesus from the dead and will give us newness of life in the
   present as well as in the future. For Paul this is the most important
   reality of Christian experience, and he would not subscribe to the
   melancholy view that Spirit and flesh are two almost equal contes-
   tants within the believer's life."—David Wenham in Pauline Stud-
    ies (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1980), p. 89.
2. The Christian's reflection of Christ is to be a progressive experi-
    ence. Paul's emphasis is on growth and continued discovery—the
    thrill of moving from one breathtaking scene of Christ's glory to
    the next.
3. This positive, progressive reflection of Christ is not something we
    create on our own. It has a divine source—"the Lord, the Spirit."

    "Look to Christ, behold the attractive loveliness of His char-
 acter, and by beholding you will become changed into His like-
 ness. The mist that intervenes between Christ and the soul will
 be rolled back as we by faith look past the hellish shadow of
 Satan and see God's glory in His law, and the righteousness of
 Christ."—Ellen White Comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol.
6, p. 1097.

                                                                    27

FURTHER STUDY: Read through Paul's letter to the Galatians.
Though Paul does not use the specific language in the letter, how does
he contrast the old and the new covenant?

   "Professed Christians keep altogether too near the lowlands of
earth. Their eyes are trained to see only commonplace things, and
their minds dwell upon the things their eyes behold. Their religious
experience is often shallow and unsatisfying, and their words are light
and valueless. How can such reflect the image of Christ? How can
they send forth the bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness into all
the dark places of the earth? To be a Christian is to be Christlike."
   "Satan is seeking to veil Jesus from our sight, to eclipse His light;
for when we get even a glimpse of His glory, we are attracted to Him.
Sin hides from our view the matchless charms of Jesus; prejudice,
selfishness, self-righteousness, and passion blind our eyes, so that we
do not discern the Saviour. Oh, if we would by faith draw nigh to God,
He would reveal to us His glory, which is His character, and the praise
of God would flow forth from human hearts and be sounded by human
voices. Then we would forever cease to give glory to Satan by sinning
against God and talking doubt and unbelief. We should no longer
stumble along, grumbling and mourning, and covering the altar of
God with our tears."—Ellen G. White Comments, SDA Bible Com-
mentary, vol. 6, p. 1097.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. One contrast Paul draws between old-covenant and new-
     covenant ministries is that the first is timid, while the sec-
     ond is marked by "boldness" (See especially 2 Cor. 3:12,
     13). In what ways should we be "very bold" (NIV) where
     now we are timid?

   2. Do you see Paul's optimism about the Christian life as being
      a bit naive? How is it possible to live the promise of verse 18
      despite the trials, temptations, and pressures of life?

   3. Paul states that "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is
      liberty" (2 Cor. 3:17, KJV). Explain the dynamic relation-
      ship between "Spirit" and "liberty." How does this relate to
      our obedience?

SUMMARY: Like Paul, we are to practice a Spirit-filled, life-giving,
new-covenant ministry that nurtures the work of Christ in human
hearts. Such ministry finds its source and inspiration in ever clearer
visions of our Lord.

                  The Young Soldier, Part 2
                     Simon Vieira Morase Neto

   I met Sidraque on the way home from town one afternoon. The
earnest young man was looking for an Adventist church, so I invited
him to evangelistic meetings that evening.
   I arrived at the meeting hall early, and found Sidraque already
waiting. We sat together during the meeting, and afterward I invited
him to study the Bible with me and see for himself if the Adventist
church taught the truth. He readily agreed. I gave him some Bible
study guides and invited him to come again the next night.
   The following evening he brought three cousins with him to the
evangelistic meeting. After the meeting all four young men stayed to
review the Bible lesson I had given Sidraque the night before. It took
a long time to cover each lesson, for Sidraque had many questions.
He wanted to understand everything!
    When we studied the lessons on the Ten Commandments and the
Sabbath, Sidraque hesitated. He was convinced that the Sabbath was
God's holy day, but some of his classes at the military school met on
Saturdays, and he could not let his family down. They expected him
to do well, become a professional soldier, and bring honor to the
family. And even though his father knew Sabbath was special, he did
not know how to keep it. Sidraque was not sure what to do; he was
not ready to give up his dream of becoming a soldier.
    Not long after this he asked me if an Adventist could become a
soldier. I told him, "I know Adventists who are soldiers in the army,
but they have difficulties keeping the Sabbath."
    After one Bible study Sidraque asked me how he could learn to
tell others what he was learning from the Bible. He paused, then
asked, "What do I do to become a preacher?" I explained that he
would have to study theology for four years to become a minister.
    Not long after that, Sidraque announced, "I have decided to quit
my military studies. I want to be baptized and study to become a
minister."
    "Finish your classwork and take your exams," I advised him. "If
 you pass the exams, you can feel confident that the Lord wants you to
 continue your military training. And if you fail, then you will know
 that God wants you to become a minister. Then you will not regret
 your decision to quit the military."
    Sidraque agreed to put the matter in God's hands.

      Principles for Ministry




Sabbath Afternoon

READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Corinthians 4:1-18.

   MEMORY TEXT: "For it is the God who commanded light to
   shine out of darkness who has shone in our hearts to give the
   light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus
   Christ" (2 Corinthians 4:6, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: When we minister on behalf of Christ, we
sometimes expect recognition for the work we do. Instead, Paul re-
minds us that ministry often brings pain and hardship, plus a deeper
reward than we ever could have imagined.

   COULD THIS BECOME YOUR STORY? Jim and Carol saw a
need. And they set about to fill it. Their creative, energetic leadership
brought fresh life to an old idea—small-group Bible-study groups in
neighborhoods. This ministry brought them much fulfillment until a
fateful meeting when Jim and Carol felt that a few people did not
appreciate their efforts. What happened next is all too familiar. They
became discouraged and resigned from the outreach they had begun
and became irregular in their church attendance. Within a few months
they were gone.
   This week's lesson provides safeguards against just such crises. If
you dare to use your gifts to minister to others, you will want to reflect
on these principles for ministry and put them to work for you. You
will need to reflect on the difference between God's approval and
others' approval.

MERCY-BASED MINISTRY (2 Cor. 4:1-6).

   List the principles of Christian ministry found in 2 Corinthians
4:1-6.


   Paul builds his discussion on an important concept: The opportu-
nity to minister is not a privilege we earn. It is given "by the mercy of
God" (verse 1, RSV). Like the blessings of the gospel itself, it is
granted by God, not on the basis of our merit, but on the basis of His
grace. We do not claim some privileged ministry. Instead, God claims
us for ministry. Saul, the persecutor of Christians, hardly merited
consideration for the position of leading Christian evangelist! True
ministry, then, is not based on the declaration, "I can!" but on God's
"You can!" For Paul, this truth is central to how we should conduct
our ministry:
1. We should declare the truth openly. Since he was not commissioned
   for ministry based on merit, Paul did not "lose heart" when people
   questioned his reputation or capabilities. He was free to express the
   gospel truthfully and openly. God's graciousness is best reflected
   in our openness.
2. Our message should be Christ-centered. It would be ridiculous for a
   ministry granted in mercy to focus on the merits of the person
   ministering! "For we do not proclaim ourselves; we proclaim Jesus
   Christ as Lord and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus' sake" (verse
   5, NRSV).
   The situation in Corinth demanded that Paul discuss and defend his
own ministry. As he defended his reputation and reviewed his creden-
tials, he was concerned that he not neglect this important principle
(see 2 Cor. 11:16-18). We should model this concern of Paul's that his
message be Christ-centered. How often self gets in the way in our
attempt to proclaim God's saving message to others. Jesus Himself in
 His earthly ministry "emptied Himself, and in all that He did, self did
not appear. He subordinated all things to the will of His Father."
 —Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 14.

   How does Paul define the work of "the god of this world"?
2 Cor. 4:3, 4, MV.


    Whether we preach a sermon, teach a Sabbath School class,
 chair a committee, or lead an outreach ministry, our egos tend
 to get in the way. How can we separate our reputations and egos
 from the service we perform? How do we help others whose egos
 and service are often entangled?

                                                                     31

THE MINISTRY OF SLAVES (2 Cor. 4:1-6).

   Paul and his companions are active in "ministry" (verse 1) and
are "slaves" (verse 5, NRSV). What meanings do these words have
today?


    Paul borrows from two important word groups to describe his role
and the role of his evangelistic team. First, Paul sees themselves
involved in "ministry." The Greek word is related to the verb "serve"
and the noun "servant." This word group originally referred to "table
service," or what we might call "waiting on tables" (see Mark 1:31).
These terms have " 'the special quality of indicating very personally
the service rendered to another.' "—Beyer quoted in Balz and Schneider,
Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament, vol. 1, p. 302.
    Second, Paul says he and his companions "proclaim Jesus Christ as
Lord and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus' sake" (verse 5, NRSV;
italics supplied). The emphasis of the word slave is on the subordinate
relationship of the slave to the master. In the Greek world, the word
had a humiliating, scornful ring to it. In the Old Testament, with its
understanding of God as Lord, to be His slave is both honorable and
desirable. For Paul, Jesus is His "Lord" or "Master," who has assigned
him and his co-workers to serve the Corinthian believers. Far from
dictating to the Corinthians (as some likely charged), he served them
on behalf of his Master. A true Christian leader is a servant of others.
Far from showing a dictatorial spirit, she or he imitates the servant-
leader model Jesus lived.

  How did Paul, as "servant," reflect his Master's ministry? Mark
10:41-45; Phil. 2:5-8.


   Think about it: "In the gospel the lordship of Christ is proclaimed
and people are called to give their allegiance to him, but the one to
whom they are thus called to submit is also the crucified one, the one
who died for them. These two basic elements of the gospel need to be
held together, for if they are not the gospel itself is distorted."—Colin
Kruse, 2 Corinthians (Grand Rapids, Mich.: InterVarsity Press, 1987),
pp. 104, 105.

   Consider the above two basic elements of the gospel, and then
reflect on the following two questions: In what specific ways can
you uphold the gospel when these elements are held together? In
what specific ways can you distort the gospel when you separate
them from each other?

HIS WONDERFUL FACE (2 Cor. 4:4, 6).

  What divine act motivates Paul's ministry? 2 Cor. 4:6. (Com-
pare John 1:14, 18.)


    Ellen White begins The Desire of Ages this way: " 'His name shall
be called Immanuel, . . . God with us"' (Matt. 1:23; Isa. 7:14) and
" 'The light of the knowledge of the glory of God' is seen 'in the face
of Jesus Christ,"' page 19; 2 Cor. 4:6. This last verse is a major point
of Christian faith: The clearest representation of God comes to us in
the incarnation Jesus Christ.

  What does the New Testament mean when it calls Jesus the
"image" of God? 2 Cor. 4:4; Col. 1:15; Heb. 1:3.


   To describe Jesus as "the image of God," or God's "express image"
means that He is the true and perfect representation of the very nature
of God in every sense of the word. They are one in outward likeness,
as well as inward character, nature, and purpose. That is why Jesus
said, "Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father" (John 14:9,
NIV). The One through whom the light was created in the beginning
became the Redeemer revealing in His face "the light of the knowl-
edge of the glory of God" (2 Cor. 4:6).
   "Our little world is the lesson book of the universe. God's wonder-
ful purpose of grace, the mystery of redeeming love, is the theme into
which 'angels desire to look,' and it will be their study throughout
endless ages. Both the redeemed and the unfallen beings will find in
the cross of Christ their science and their song. It will be seen that the
glory shining in the face of Jesus is the glory of self-sacrificing love.
In the light from Calvary it will be seen that the law of self-renouncing
love is the law of life for earth and heaven; that the love which
`seeketh not her own' has its source in the heart of God; and that in the
meek and lowly One is manifested the character of Him who dwelleth
in the light which no man can approach un10. . . .
   "But turning from all lesser representations, we behold God in
Jesus. Looking unto Jesus we see that it is the glory of our God to
give."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 19-21.

    Paul declares that the new covenant reflects a permanent
 glory (2 Cor. 3:7-18). Indeed, the glory of God's revelation in
 Christ is both for time and for eternity. Meditate upon your
 favorite New Testament story involving Jesus. What does it
 teach you about God and His desire to save you?

                                                                      33

TREASURE IN CLAY POTS (2 Cor. 4:7-15).

   How does Paul continue to show the relationship between his
evangelistic team and the message they preach? 2 Cor. 4:7-12. List
the striking contrasts he employs that give hope and confidence in
God's power at work in our lives.




    Imagine going to a fine department store and buying an expensive
vase. The clerk wraps the article carefully, places it in a bag, and sends
you on your way. When you arrive home, you throw away the wrap-
ping and bag, then find the perfect place for your new treasure.
    Paul is suggesting that he and his partners are disposable, like the
packaging around a treasure. Their purpose is not to draw attention to
themselves but to help others appreciate the treasure they bear—"the
glory of God in the face of Jesus" (verse 6, NRSV). If they are always
being thrown aside, it is so Jesus' life may be displayed (verse 10).
    True ministry is often exhausting. Those who participate in it (as
we all should) often will feel rejected. However grand its moments, it
is bound to have times of emotional and physical stress. Ministry costs
something. Sometimes it costs everything.
    Such knowledge should not surprise those who know the story of
Jesus. In fact, those who are ministering on behalf of Jesus will
discover they are reflecting His story. "We always carry around in our
body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed
in our body" (verse 10, NIV).

   In spite of his difficult situation, what hope does Paul express
for the future? 2 Cor. 4:13-15.


    Because God has a splendid future for those who display His glory,
it does not matter how often Paul and his friends are "thrown away."
They serve One who has been resurrected. That One has a common
destiny for His servants and the people they serve. One day, they will
be led "into his presence" (verse 14, NRSV).

   What gives you hope during stressful times? What difference
 does such hope make in your life? In what ways can you impart
 hope to those facing trying circumstances?

HARD PRESSED BUT NOT CRUSHED (2 Cor. 4:7-12).

   Compare the summary of Paul's afflictions in 2 Corinthians
4:7-12 with lists he provides elsewhere:

  1 Cor. 4:9-13

  2 Cor. 6:4, 5

  2 Cor. 11:23-29

  2 Cor. 12:10

   Think of two or three of your friends who minister on behalf of
Jesus. What types of affliction do they experience as a result of
their efforts? How have you suffered as a result of your witness?


    Paul adds to our understanding of the role of suffering in Christian
life and ministry. He sees God at work in the trials he experiences. The
fact that Paul is "afflicted in every way" (2 Cor. 4:8, NRSV) allows us
to understand that he is the bearer of a divine treasure. And while Paul
experiences "death," it brings "life" to others (verse 12). Also, Paul
sees God's hand at work in limiting his suffering. He and his friends
are "hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in
despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not de-
stroyed" (verses 8, 9, NIV; compare 1 Cor. 10:13). Most inspiring of
all, Paul comes to understand that suffering hardships to bring life to
others is a reflection of his Lord's work (2 Cor. 4:10-12).

   If the treasure in our earthen vessels is what is so precious, why
do we concern ourselves so much with the vessels? 2 Cor. 2:7.


   "Our weakness is no barrier to the purposes of God. Self-reliance is
the barrier. Whatever you do, don't make the mistake of focusing on
the container, either in awe or in criticism. Look to the treasure. As
someone put it years ago, 'It is impossible to impress people with your
own cleverness and at the same time to impress them with the wonder
of Jesus Christ.' "—Louis Venden in the Richards Lectureship Series,
October 22 and 23, 1995, Andrews University.

    What can you do today to develop the endurance and loyalty
 to the gospel in the face of hardship that Paul consistently showed?

FURTHER STUDY: In Romans 5:1-5, what attitude toward suffer-
ing does Paul view as a result of justification by faith? Review Paul's
understanding of the benefits of suffering in 2 Corinthians 1:3-11.

   "Let us then put away all self-exaltation. As long as the cross of
Calvary stands as a monument of the cost of our salvation, as a
reminder of the amazing love and humiliation of the King of glory, let
us walk in its shadow, and seek to reflect the character of our Re-
deemer. Go to him as a perfect Saviour, for He has said, 'Him that
cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.' There is no reason why we
should seek to exalt ourselves, for we are full of weakness. As you
realize this, trust in Him whose grace is sufficient for you, for 'we
have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power
may be of God, and not of us.' "—The Signs of the Times, March 9,
1888.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  I. Design two or three questions that could help determine
     whether or not one is practicing servant ministry. Share
     your list with others. Use the best of them to make a set of
     questions you can use in prayerful self-examination.

   2. In conducting evangelistic outreach, we sometimes hide our
      identity by holding meetings in neutral locations and by not
      placing the name Seventh-day Adventist on advertisements.
      In view of Paul's call to openness, would he approve of such
      strategies? Why or why not?

   3. How might the following quotations help us to understand
      our ministry as Christians?

      "The world is changed not by the self-regarding, but by
      men and women prepared to make fools of themselves."
      —P. D. James.

      "Learn the lesson that, if you are to do the work of a
      prophet, what you need is not a scepter but a hoe."
      —Bernard of Clairvaux.

SUMMARY: In His mercy, God commissions Christians to share
"the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ." In fulfilling this
commission, we may experience all types of trouble. But no trouble
can dim the privilege of bearing the treasure of the gospel to a desti-
tute world.

                 The Young Soldier, Part 3
                     Simon Vieira Morase Neto

    After studying the Bible with me for two months, Sidraque de-
cided to be baptized. He was concerned about what his family's
response would be, so I agreed to pray with him that God would
soften their hearts.
    He contacted them and told them that he had found the Seventh-
day Adventist church in Sao Luis and had been studying the Bible
with an Adventist. Then he told them of his decision to be baptized
as a Seventh-day Adventist. His mother had heard that some reli-
gious sects were kidnapping and brainwashing young people. She
feared that Sidraque had fallen into the hands of one of these
groups, and reacted strongly. "If you join this church, forget that I
am your mother!"
    However, Sidraque's father, who was quite ill at the time, told his
son, "If it is your desire, and if it is for your good, you may be
baptized."
    Sidraque wanted me to visit his father. He told me, "I don't want
my father to die without knowing what I have learned. And if he
should die before I am 18, my mother won't let me get baptized."
    But Sidraque's family lived a long distance from Sao Luis, and I
would not be able to go for several months. Because Sidraque wanted
his parents' blessing on his baptism, he decided to wait. However,
just after Sidraque turned 18, his father died. A few weeks later
Sidraque and his three cousins, who had been studying with him, set
the date for their baptism. I urged him to invite his family. His
mother and brothers, who had objected to his baptism, agreed to
come.
    As he had promised, Sidraque completed his classes and prepared
 for his exams. When he did not pass, he accepted this as an answer to
 prayer. Now he attends the theological seminary in Brazil to prepare
 for the ministry. During his vacations he colporteurs to earn his
 school tuition. His brothers, who had initially objected to his joining
 the church, are helping him with his tuition.
    "I always wanted to become a soldier in Brazil's army," Sidraque
 says. "But now I am training to be a soldier in God's army, not to win
 wars for a country, but to win souls for God's kingdom; not to
 receive medals as a hero, but to receive trophies from the King of
 Kings; not to kill, but to bring life through Jesus Christ."

             Ministry in Focus




Sabbath Afternoon

READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Cor. 4:16-5:21.

   MEMORY TEXT: "For our light affliction, which is but for a
   moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal
   weight of glory, while we do not look at the things which are
   seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which
   are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are
   eternal" (2 Corinthians 4:17, 18, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Accepting Christ's work on our behalf changes
our outlook on everything. God's plan for us will guide the choices we
make. And we will learn to value ourselves and others at the foot of an
old, rugged cross.

    TO MINISTER FOR CHRIST REQUIRES FOCUS. Have you
ever watched a slide show that is slightly out of focus? The temptation
is to shout, "Focus, please!" And when at last the blurred images
clear—what a great relief.
    Unlike a slide show, ministry is not a spectator activity. We must
invest every fiber of our being to serve others on behalf of Jesus. But
ministry does require focus. For each of us, the focus of our service for
Christ, the "Why?" of our ministry, may slowly blur. In 2 Corinthians
4:16-5:10, Paul invites us to sharpen our focus on ministry. In view of
God's reconciliation worked out in Christ's ministry on our behalf, we
receive clearer vision of ourselves and others, plus the present and the
future. We gain focus for reflecting God's own ministry in our lives.

FOCUS ON OURSELVES (2 Cor. 4:16-5:5).

   Paul's success in ministry does not depend on how others evaluate
him but on how God views things. If one applies the usual measures of
success, one may fault him for his physical appearance or his lack of
confidence and eloquence (see 1 Cor. 2:3, 4; 2 Cor. 10:10). Also, one
may think there must be something wrong with a person who experi-
ences so many trials! But fortunately "The Lord sees not as man sees;
man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart"
(1 Sam. 16:7, RSV).

  Paul viewed himself and his ministry from God's point of view.
How are you viewing yourself and your ministry? 2 Cor. 4:16-
5:10. What difference does it make to see things from God's
perspective instead of our own?


   Paul seems to be saying, "If you wish to pass judgment on me and
my ministry, you must not do so on the basis of this poor, battered
frame. Instead, your judgment must be in agreement with that final
and eternal opinion coming from the court of Christ" (verse 10). His
judgment will not be based on the visible and temporary but on the
invisible and eternal. "I have nothing to fear from such an investiga-
tion, for I have not based my life and ministry on short-lived values,
but on eternal ones."
   This passage is good news for all of us who gaze into the mirror and
find fresh evidence of our mortality. Our true significance and worth
is not reflected in deepening wrinkles and receding hairlines. Disease
and disability may afflict our mortal bodies. But God has a far greater
reality in store for us! What really matters ultimately is how God
views us and the blessed hope awaiting us. These are the eternal
realities that we need to focus on during our earthly pilgrimage.

   To discover what that greater reality is, read 2 Corinthians
1:22; 4:16; 5:5; and Ephesians 1:14.


    What do the following verses mean to you? "Then the eyes of
 the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped;
 then the lame shall leap like a deer, and the tongue of the
 speechless sing for joy." "And the ransomed of the Lord shall
 return, and come to Zion with singing; everlasting joy shall be
 upon their heads; they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow
 and sighing shall flee away" (Isa. 35:5, 6, 10, NRSV).


                                                                   39

FOCUS ON THE FUTURE (2 Cor. 5:1-9).

  Many believe that 2 Cor. 5:1-9 proves we will go immediately to
heaven when we die. How would you explain the passage?


   In verses 1-5, Paul describes three human conditions. He does not
focus on when the change will occur from one condition to the next.
To discover Paul's description of these conditions, complete the fol-
lowing chart:
     Earthly Life                 Death            Heavenly Life
 "the earthly tent" "when we have taken it
 (verse 1, NIV)         [this tent] off" (verse 3,
                        NRSV)
 "this tent" (verses 2,                           "our    heavenly
4, NIV)                                          dwelling" (verse 2)

                          "unclothed" (verse 4,
                          NIV)

   Does Paul look forward to the "nakedness' of death as a time
when he will be with the Lord? When will believers be "at home
with the Lord"? 2 Cor. 5:2-9, NIV (compare John 14:1-3; 1 Cor.
15:51-57).

   In 2 Cor. 5:6-9, Paul, employing the contrast of being at home or
away from home, discusses the present and future conditions. While
thinking that Paul is emphasizing what happens at death, we can
continue the chart above as follows.
      Earthly Life               Death              Heavenly Life
"at home in the
                      [verses 6-9 do not
body . . . away
                 from discuss death]
the Lord" (verse 6)
"we walk by faith"                       walking by "sight"
(verse 7, KJV)                           (verse 7)
                                                  "at home" (verse 9)
  First Corinthians 15 51-57 is clear about when the dramatic change
occurs. So Paul's readers already know that the blessed state of "at
home with the Lord" begins at Christ's return.

  As you read 1 Corinthians 15:51-57, meditate upon what this
moment will mean to you, your friends, and your family.

FOCUS ON THE PRESENT (2 Cor. 4:16-18; 5:10).

  How should we evaluate the afflictions and trials we experi-
ence? 2 Cor. 4:16-18.


   While Paul wants his readers to view clearly the future, he does not
ask them to forget the present. To understand the present, they and we
need to start looking through the wide-angle lens of the plan of
redemption.
   Paul refers to the present life as "the earthly tent" or "this tent"
(2 Cor. 5:1, 2, 4, NIV). Our bodies are fragile and temporal. Paul
agrees with the prayer "Lord, let me know my end, and what is the
measure of my days; let me know how fleeting my life is" (Ps. 39:4,
NRSV; compare Ps. 90:12). But God has in store for us a resurrection
body—a "house." A tent is a temporary structure. But God's "house"
is heavenly, permanent, and eternal.

  What future event should guide our lives now? 2 Cor. 5:9, 10;
Rom. 14:10. Do we view such an event with anxiety and fear or
with joyous anticipation? Why?


   Paul stresses the aim of the Christian life—to please the Lord. Later,
he will urge, "Try to find out what is pleasing to the Lord" (Eph. 5:10,
NRSV). To emphasize the importance of doing so, he points to our
appointment before "the judgment seat of Christ." "Judgment seat"
translates from a Greek term used for public seats of judgment and
especially for the official seat higher-ranking Roman officials used when
issuing their judgments. Paul had made an appearance before such a seat
of the Roman proconsul Gallio in Corinth (Acts 18:12-17). Towering far
above all human courts is the judgment seat of Christ.
   "He [Christ] is particularly fitted for this task. He is the world's
Creator and its Redeemer. It is a most awesome thought that our
Saviour is to be our judge. He took upon Him the nature of those who
will come before His bar of justice (Phil. 2:6-8), those whose destiny
He will decide. He suffered every temptation to which they have been
subjected (Heb. 2:14-17; 4:15). He stood in man's place. In Christ
divine wisdom is combined with human experience."—SDA Bible
Commentary, vol. 6, p. 864.

    In view of Paul's counsel, how might you evaluate (1) the
 daily challenges of seeking to be a good parent, spouse, or friend;
 (2) the priority of squeezing time for ministry into an already
 stretched schedule.

                                                                     41
Wednesday                                                 July 29
FOCUS ON PEOPLE (2 Cor. 5:11-17).

  If we need to evaluate others, what attitudes should we have?
On what basis should a Christian evaluate others? 2 Cor. 5:11-17.


   All too often we characterize people by their weaknesses or the
traumas they have experienced. We refer to someone as "the blind
man" or "the crippled woman" or "the one who just got divorced."
Our human eyes focus on a person's flaws. But God invites us to see
people from His point of view.
   The Corinthians were tempted to view Paul from a human point of
view, to discredit him because of his weaknesses and trials. Paul,
however, learned a different outlook—not his own but his Lord's.
"From now on, therefore, we regard no one from a human point of
view" (verse 16, NRSV).

   What was wrong with the way Paul once viewed Christ? 2 Cor.
5:16.


   Paul once viewed Christ from only a human viewpoint. Jesus was
simply a misguided would-be messiah whose erring followers must be
disciplined. But Paul learned to worship as Lord the One he had
scorned. And with this transformation, he found that his view of all
people changed drastically. He came to see Jesus as the Son of God.
And he came to see all people as potential daughters and sons of God.
Such vision motivates Paul's plea, "Be reconciled to God" (verse 20).
   Francis Schaeffer once reflected upon the self-understanding of
many Christians: " 'It is wonderful to be a Christian, but I am such a
small person, so limited in talents—or energy or psychological strength
or knowledge—that what I do is not really important." Schaeffer
provided a corrective: "The Bible, however, has quite a different
emphasis: With God there are no little people."—No Little People
(Downers Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press, 1974), p. 13. Paul invites us
to measure both ourselves and others in the light of Calvary (2 Cor.
5:14, 15).

    Often people need to evaluate other people. For example,
 teachers grade pupils, and employers evaluate employees. How
 could our evaluating procedures reflect the values of 2 Corinthians
5:11-17? How could this passage affect our desire to "evaluate"
 (judge) people such as church officers, fellow members, a young
 member expelled from church school. . .?

FOCUS ON GOD IN CHRIST (2 Cor. 5:14-21).

  As you read verses 14, 15, 18-21 out loud, try to recapture
Paul's joy for God's work of reconciliation.


   These verses include at least three summaries of God's work for us.
Each summary is an attempt to describe the indescribable—God's
grace. With each is an explanation of the change God's work brings to
our lives. Fill in the missing sections of the chart.
       God's Work for Us             Our Response to God's Work


 I. Christ died for all (verses     1. We no longer live for ourselves
14, 15).                           but for Christ (verse 15).


2. God, in Christ, reconciled      2.
 us to himself (verse 18).


  3.                                 3. In Christ we become the right-
                                     eousness of God (verse 21).


  Of all the descriptions of the gospel in 2 Corinthians 5:14-21,
which do you find the most inspiring? Why?


   "When men and women can more fully comprehend the magnitude
of the great sacrifice which was made by the Majesty of heaven in
dying in man's stead, then will the plan of salvation be magnified, and
reflections of Calvary will awaken tender, sacred, and lively emotions
in the Christians's heart. . . . This world will appear of but little value
to those who appreciate the great price of man's redemption, the
precious blood of God's dear Son. All the riches of the world are not
of sufficient value to redeem one perishing soul. Who can measure the
love Christ felt for a lost world as He hung upon the cross, suffering
for the sins of guilty men? . . . "
   "Upon this theme it is a sin to be calm and unimpassioned."
—Testimonies for the Church, vol. 2, pp. 212, 213.

    How have I allowed the gospel to transform me? Am I
 living for Christ? In what specific ways am I a minister of
 reconciliation?

                                                                       43
Friday                                                      July 31
FURTHER STUDY: Two additional points may prove helpful in
sharing your views of 2 Corinthians 5:1-10. (1) In 2 Corinthians 4:13,
14, Paul states his belief in the resurrection and indicates that being
brought into "his [Christ's] presence" follows rather than comes be-
fore that event. (2) Second Timothy 4:6-8 indicates that Paul expected
to receive his "crown" at Christ's return.
   Philippians 1:18-26 is another of Paul's passages about death that
many people misunderstand. Take time to reflect on it in light of our
study on 2 Corinthians 5:1-10. Do some of the same insights apply?
Note that Paul reflects elsewhere in Philippians his belief in the
resurrection (or transformation) at Christ's return (Phil. 3:10, 11, 20,
21).
   Read Ellen White's vision of "The Judgment" in Testimonies for
the Church, vol. 4, pp. 384-387. What should be our attitude toward
the judgment?

   "Today, in the spirit and power of Elias and of John the Baptist,
messengers of God's appointment are calling the attention of a
judgment-bound world to the solemn events soon to take place in
connection with the closing hours of probation and the appearance of
Christ Jesus as King of kings and Lord of lords. Soon every man is to
be judged for the deeds done in the body. The hour of God's judgment
has come, and upon the members of His church on earth rests the
solemn responsibility of giving warning to those who are standing as
it were on the very brink of eternal ruin."—Prophets and Kings,
p. 716.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Paul wrote whole letters dedicated to the theme that salva-
     tion is available to all on the basis of faith in Christ (Ro-
     mans; Galatians). How, then, can he describe a judgment
     based on works "done in the body, whether good or evil"?
     (2 Cor. 5:10, NRSV).

   2. How can we help people who have heard the story of Cal-
      vary again and again recapture the wonder of God's work
      in Christ?

SUMMARY: Just as Paul's perspectives were drastically transformed
on the road to Damascus, our views will likewise be altered by a clear
vision of Christ's work for us. Then we will learn to evaluate every-
thing from the eternal perspective of God's plan of salvation.

                     Treasure in a Trunk
                            J. H. Zachary

   "If you speak any more about this Jesus or the Bible, you will be
fired!" Rosa's boss threatened.
   Rosa Faracova grew up in a Muslim home in the Russian Fed-
eration. In the face of Communist oppression, many people either
set aside their religious practices or gave up their faith completely.
   But in 1995, while sorting through her mother's things, Rosa
discovered an old book hidden in a trunk. She thought it was a
prayer book, but as she began reading, she discovered that it was
an aging Bible that her mother had read in secret during the years
of spiritual drought. As she read, she found stories of men and
women who faced problems in life that were similar to her own.
She thrilled to learn how God helped them. She began reading the
Bible daily.
    A year later Rosa saw an advertisement for a Bible class. She
joined the class, and as she studied, she found new peace and hope.
Six months later she and seven others were baptized and became
the first Sabbath keepers in her city.
    Rosa was eager to share her discoveries with her friends and
fellow workers, all nominal Muslims. She wanted them to experi-
ence the joy she had found. But witnessing was hard. Some called
her a traitor to her religion; others coldly refused to listen to her;
then her boss told her not to speak of religion on the job.
    Rosa, a single mother with a 7-year-old son, could not afford to
risk losing her job. But she had to tell others what Jesus has done
for her. "I long for my friends to come to know my Jesus as their
Friend," she told me at a seminar where she was learning how to
share her faith with her Muslim friends and relatives.
    A new set of Bible study guides is being written and translated
for believers like Rosa. Using the Muslim Quran and the Bible,
 these lessons highlight the points common to Adventism and
                           Islam: faith in Jesus, the Sabbath, the Sec-
                           ond Advent, healthful lifestyle, and the
                           judgment, as well as others.
                               Pray for Rosa and hundreds like her as
                           they share Jesus with others in the Russian
                           Federation.

               The Ministry of
               Reconciliation




Sabbath Afternoon

READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Cor. 5:18-6:13.

MEMORY TEXT: "God was in Christ reconciling the world to
Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed
to us the word of reconciliation" (2 Corinthians 5:19, NKJV).

  KEY THOUGHT: In God's reconciling work through Christ, we
hear a call to extend the message of reconciliation in the home, the
church, and the world.

   IN CHRIST, WE ARE RECONCILED WITH GOD. Some of
the words Paul uses to explain God's work of salvation are difficult to
understand. "Justification" comes from the law courts. And "redemp-
tion" reflects the practice of freeing slaves on payment of a price.
"Reconciliation," though, is easily understood by all who have experi-
enced the healing of a relationship. We need only reflect on a time
when shoulders gave way to warm embraces or when words of accusa-
tion changed to forgiveness. God "reconciled us to himself through
Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation" (2 Cor. 5:18, NIV).
Reconciliation with a human companion is blessed indeed. This, how-
ever, is the greatest wonder—through Christ we have been reconciled
to God!
   As you study this week's lesson, remember that Christ wants to
share with you His ministry of reconciliation as you reach others
for Him. By God's grace, determine to be a minister of such
reconciliation.

PAUL: MINISTER OF RECONCILIATION (2 Cor. 5:18-21).

  On what basis does God offer reconciliation to the human
family? 2 Cor. 5:18-21; Rom. 5:6-11.


   Philip Hughes says of 2 Corinthians 5:21, "There is no sentence
more profound in the whole of Scripture."—Paes Second Epistle to
the Corinthians, (Atlanta, Ga.: Presbyterian Church U.S.A. Executive
Commitee for Home Missions) p. 211. 2 Cor. 5:18-21 discloses a
profound truth: God not only initiates reconciliation. He is its goal.
"Through Christ every obstruction is removed, and access to God is
secured. Man is urged and welcomed to the pardoning love of God. By
His love for fallen men, God is honored and glorified and magnified
through Jesus Christ. God can be just, and yet pardon the transgressor.
Oh, what love, what matchless love!"—Ellen G. White, The Home
Missionary, Nov. 1, 1897.

   What impact does Christ's death have on our relationship with
God and with one another? What is the extent of the reconcilia-
tion Christ won? 2 Cor. 5:18-21; Eph. 2:11-22; Col. 1:19, 20;
Gal. 3:26, 20.


   Paul's focus in 2 Corinthians 5:18-21 is on reconciliation between
humans and God. This is "vertical" reconciliation. However, God's
reconciling work in Christ also affects our relationships with others.
This is "horizontal" reconciliation. That Paul also is interested in
reconciliation among Christians is obvious for at least two reasons: (1)
Paul remains concerned about his relationship with the Corinthian
believers. When he pleads, "Be reconciled to God" (verse 20, NIV),
he also is asking them to open their hearts to him (2 Cor. 6:11); (2) In
chapters 8 and 9, we see the deep commitment Paul has to reconcilia-
tion between Jewish and Gentile Christians. "The collection" dis-
cussed there is likely his way of nurturing such reconciliation.

    Review the following incidents where Paul served as a "minis-
ter of reconciliation" in order to bring Christians together. What
can you learn from them that will help you to become reconciled
to someone? 1 Cor. 1:10-12; Phil. 4:2, 3; Philemon.

    Can you recall an incident when God used you as a "minister
 of reconciliation"? What plans do you have to be a reconciler in
 your family, church, and place of work? How would you go
 about implementing such plans?
                                                                    47

RECONCILIATION GOES TO CHURCH (2 Cor. 5:18-21; Matt.
5:23, 24; 18:15-20; John 13:12-17).

  Jesus provided strategies for reconciliation among church mem-
bers. Describe each strategy after the appropriate verse. How
useful are these strategies today?

   Matt. 5:23, 24.

   "When our duty is so plainly marked out, why do so many church
members go contrary to a plain 'Thus saith the Lord,' and speak of
their difficulties to those who know nothing in regard to them or in
regard to those whom these difficulties concern? Jesus the great Teacher,
has told us what our duty is. Our gifts, our prayers are not acceptable
to God while we leave this duty undone, and let the poison of envy,
evil-surmising, and jealousy, take possession of our souls, and spoil
our union and happiness. Oh, how much unhappiness would be spared,
and how many evil thoughts would be quenched, if believers would
take up the work that Christ has said must be done to prevent evil
thinking and evil speaking."—This Day With God, p. 19.

   Matt. 18:15-20.

   A person who has been wronged is not the only one who can
initiate reconciliation. "If we have in any way grieved or wounded
others, it is our duty to confess our fault and seek for reconciliation.
This is an essential preparation that we may come before God in faith,
to ask His blessing."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 144.

   John 13:12-17.

   "Reconciliation one with another is the work for which the ordi-
nance of feet washing was instituted.
   "As Christ celebrated this ordinance with His disciples, conviction
came to the hearts of all save Judas. So we shall be convicted as Christ
speaks to our hearts. The fountains of the soul will be broken up. The
mind will be energized, and, springing into activity and life, will break
down every barrier that has caused dissension and alienation."
—Evangelism, p. 275.

   As you read Ephesians 4:31, 32, ask youself: How well does
 my life reflect this passage? If there is one characteristic in these
 verses on which God has been wanting to get your attention,
 spend some time now in thoughtful prayer and reflection.

RECONCILIATION COMES HOME (2 Cor. 5:18-21; Eph. 5:21-
33).

   How might family members reflect the reconciling work of God
in Christ? 2 Cor. 5:18-21; Eph. 5:21-33.


   God's work in Christ is designed to be practical to our daily lives.
God longs to make us "ministers of reconciliation." And He invites us
to reflect His reconciling love in our relationships with family mem-
bers. Christians, then, have a marvelous privilege—we, the recipients
of God's reconciliation, may actually help to widen the circle of
reconciliation. Nowhere is such a witness more needed than within the
home.

   What are some of your favorite words of counsel that would
help support reconciliation in the home? Possibilities might
include Prov. 12:18; 14:29; 15:1, 28; 17:9, 14; and Eph. 4:26.


   Tourists on Tokyo's subway sometimes find it difficult to deter-
mine the correct fare. Some clever travelers discover that each station
has a "fare adjustment" window. When someone cannot determine a
fare, one can pay the highest rate, then receive the appropriate refund
at the end of the trip! In the home, there also is a "fare adjustment"
window. It is the two words "I'm sorry." We must often step up to the
window and speak these words. They allow us to make adjustments
for those difficult parts of the journey where we have misjudged the
effects of our words and actions. Also, they trigger the work of
reconciliation.
    "Love's agencies have wonderful power, for they are divine. The
soft answer that `tumeth away wrath,' the love that `suffereth long,
and is kind,' the charity that `covereth a multitude of sins' (Proverbs
15:1; 1 Corinthians 13:4, R.V.; 1 Peter 4:8, R.V.)--would we learn the
lesson, with what power for healing would our lives be gifted! How
life would be transformed, and the earth become a very likeness and
foretaste of heaven!"—Education, p. 114.

    What do you see as a job description of a "minister of recon-
 ciliation"? How much of a reconciler have you been in the last
 month? What specific telephone calls could you place, letters
 could you write, or visits could you make that would help to
 rebuild some bridges in your family, work place, church, neigh-
 borhood, or community?


                                                                    49

CHURCH MISSION AND RECONCILIATION (Rev. 14:6, 7;
Matt. 28:16-20).

  How does our mission imply the need for reconciliation among
races? Rev. 14:6, 7; Matt. 28:16-20. How do the results of that
message reflect the same need? Rev. 7:9, 10.


   In a world where "ethnic cleansing" is a present evil, the church
needs to witness to another set of values—values that "rate" people,
not on the basis of prejudice, but on the basis of eternal worth. We are
to regard no one from merely "a human point of view" (2 Cor. 5:16,
NRSV). We are called to a global mission that is promised success in
winning a reconciled and redeemed community drawn from every-
where on earth.
   "Jesus is not going to save Greeks and Jews, or Blacks and Whites,
or Hispanics and Asians, or Italians and Germans, or Irish and En-
glish, or West Indians and Africans, or Americans and Russians, or
Armenians and Azerbaijanis, or Israelis and Palestinians, or Paki-
stanis and Indians, or Iraqis and Iranians, or Japanese and Chinese. He
is going to save a 'new humanity' who have risen by God's grace
above ethnocentric world views, prejudicial attitudes, political ideol-
ogies, and racist actions, to become the 'new men' and 'new women'—
the new humanity—in Christ."—Caleb Rosado, Broken Walls (Boise,
Idaho: Pacific Press, 1990), p. 87. (See Eph. 2:11-22.)

 Scripture links our mission to the world with reconciliation.
What does this tell us about God?


   We may be tempted to feel that reconciliation between and among
ethnic groups or tribes is something that should be accomplished in an
afternoon or two. But Paul's experience tells us the task is far more
involved than that. He spent his entire ministry trying to reconcile
Jewish and Gentile Christians. We must listen carefully to one another
until we have a fresh degree of understanding. Then we must listen
again and again. We must not be discouraged but work persistently to
reconcile and to be reconciled, ever measuring our reactions to others
by God's own reconciling work toward us.

   How great do you think is the need for reconciliation among
ethnic groups in our church today? In your congregation? What
role do you think God might wish you to play where you live?
Where you work?

HEARTS OPEN TO RECONCILIATION (2 Cor. 6:1-13).

   If you had been one of the Corinthian Christians, what do you
think your response might have been to Paul's appeals in
2 Corinthians 6:1, 2, 11-13? Why?


   Paul has just issued one of the most heartfelt invitations in the
Bible: "We implore you on Christ's behalf: Be reconciled to God"
(2 Cor. 5:20, NIV). To this he adds another invitation. "Behold, now is
the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation" (2 Cor. 6:2,
KJV). Since Paul is addressing Christians, we may each hear a call to
accept afresh God's reconciling work. Have you accepted Christ
today as your Saviour and Lord?

   Why is the life we live important to the success of the gospel?
2 Cor. 6:1-13.


   In 2 Corinthians 6:1-13, Paul returns to the relationship of the
Corinthians between God, Paul himself, and his companions. Paul's
opening appeal invites them to respond to God's grace by accepting it
immediately. His closing appeal invites them to "open wide" their
hearts toward him. "In all his dealings with them . .. Paul has been out
of the abundance of his heart . . . . His heart has always been full of
love for them, and even now he yearns for them and for their loving
response. He has met all their criticisms in the spirit of Christ, with
largeness of heart."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 876.
   Between these two appeals, Paul once again defends his ministry.
He states again that the hardships he has endured are a badge of honor.
In these afflictions, Paul and company have, through God's power,
modeled the great Christian virtues (verses 6, 7). They have minis-
tered consistently through shifting tides of public opinion and unfair
treatment (verses 8-10).
    Among the contradictions of his ministry that Paul lists is that he
and his helpers are "unknown, and yet are well known" (verse
9, NRSV). They have earned no grand reputation among humans. But
in God's sight, they are well known. Interestingly, Paul's sacrificial
ministry has made him, in our own day, one of the best-known figures
of history!

    If we could ask you, 0 Creator, for one gift, it would be for
 the gift of open hearts—hearts that are wide open to You, and
 hearts that are wide open to every one of Your children. We ask
 in the name of the great Reconciler, Amen.

                                                                    51

FURTHER STUDY: Study Genesis 32, 33, and Luke 15:11-31. What
do these stories teach us about reconciliation?

   "No distinction on account of nationality, race, or caste, is recog-
nized by God. He is the Maker of all mankind. All men are of one
family by creation, and all are one through redemption. Christ came to
demolish every wall of partition, to throw open every compartment of
the temple, that every soul may have free access to God. . . . In Christ
there is neither Jew nor Greek, bond nor free. All are brought nigh by
His precious blood"—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 386.
   "Caste is hateful to God. . . .Without distinction of age, or rank, or
nationality, or religious privilege, all are invited to come unto Him
and live."—The Desire of Ages, p. 403.
   "When the Holy Spirit moves upon human minds, all petty com-
plaints and accusations between man and his fellow man will be put
away. The bright beams of the Sun of Righteousness will shine into
the chambers of the mind and heart. In our worship of God there will
be not distinction between rich and poor, white and black. All preju-
dice will be melted away. When we approach God, it will be as one
brotherhood. We are pilgrims and strangers, bound for a better coun-
try, even a heavenly. There all pride, all accusation, all self-deception,
will forever have an end."—Review and Herald, Oct. 24, 1899,
p. 677.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Can you think of biblical stories of reconciliation? (For
     example, the truce between Jacob and Esau, Genesis 33, or
     of Christ's parable of the prodigal son, Luke 15). What
     lessons of reconciliation can we learn from these stories?

   2. What are some problems we face that alienate and separate
      people today? What can you do personally to help bring
      about healing in your church and your community?

   3. How does our attitude toward reconciliation with others
      affect our relationship with God? If we cling to prejudices
      and refuse to reconcile with others, how do we put at risk
      our reconciliation with God?

SUMMARY: The gospel proclamation of God's reconciling work in
Christ commissions us to take part in the "ministry of reconciliation."
To a world in desperate need of reconciliation, Paul calls us to be a
reconciled community.

             Haunted House Helps Open Work
                              Samuel Ada

    The three young missionaries from the 1000 Missionary Move-
ment arrived in Masalisi, a large community in the Philippines, and
began looking for a place to live. They soon found a house that
seemed to meet their needs. It had not been occupied for years, and
the rent was surprisingly cheap. "It belongs to a well-to-do family
who has moved closer to town," the agent explained. They rented
the house and moved in, thanking God for providing for their
needs so quickly and cheaply.
    As the young men began meeting their new neighbors, it seemed
that everyone was interested in where they lived. Then they learned
that the house was "haunted."
    "How did you drive away the devil?" one neighbor asked.
    "We cannot get close to the house! Surely God is with you!"
another remarked.
    The young missionaries' fame spread quickly, and they found
ready welcome in the homes. People listened eagerly to their
testimony, because they had overcome the spirits in the haunted
house. After only four months of visitation, the young people were
ready to hold evangelistic meetings.
    Some 65 people attended the two-week series of meetings. They
listened carefully and seemed to understand the Bible truths. But
when the call was given to follow Jesus in baptism, only one brave
soul came forward. The missionaries were puzzled by the lack of
 response from the people.
    They visited the people, and asked what had held them back
 from taking their stand for Jesus. "I believe," they heard repeat-
edly, "but I am waiting for others to step forward before I take my
stand." The missionaries prayed that God would touch their hearts.
    Little by little the people took their stand for God and prepared
 for baptism. Soon 15 were baptized, and others were studying for
 baptism.
    The new believers worshiped in an old tent and prayed for
 means to provide a church for themselves and those who would
 follow. One of the new members provided a small piece of land in
 the center of the community for a church building. The newly
 organized company is now working toward its dream to have a
 simple church in which to worship.

    Samuel Ada is associate director for missionary training at the 1000
  Missionary Movement campus outside Manila in the Philippines.

  Commitment for Ministry




Sabbath Afternoon

READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Cor. 6:14-7:16.

   MEMORY TEXT: "Do not be unequally yoked together with
   unbelievers. For what fellowship has righteousness with law-
   lessness? And what communion has light with darkness?"
   (2 Cor. 6:14, KJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: The Lordship of Jesus should dominate our
lives rather than just be one influence among many.

    DOUBLE AGENTS NEED NOT APPLY. Aldrich Ames is the
most famous double agent of our times. Ames, who now occupies a
cell in a maximum security prison, worked in the United States Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency for more than thirty years. For at least the last
nine years of his career, he worked as a double agent, selling state
secrets. In exchange for $2.5 million, he exposed more than one
hundred intelligence operations. No one seemed to notice that, on a
modest salary, he paid cash for a $500,000 home and the art work it
contained. Eventually though, a carelessly discarded document testi-
fied to his divided loyalties.
   Paul worries that Christians might be recruited as double agents. So
he commands, "Do not be mismatched with unbelievers" (2 Cor. 6:14,
NRSV). He is concerned that our loyalty to Christ may be at risk.
Ministry for Christ will admit no double agents nor will it allow
double lives. Ours is not an undercover mission. We are to acknowl-
edge openly our absolute allegiance to the kingdom of Christ.

BE SEPARATE! (2 Cor. 6:14-7:1).

  What command opens 2 Corinthians 6:14-7:1? (Compare Deut.
22:10; Lev. 19:19.)


   Five questions follow this command, each expecting in response a
definite, "None!" The contrasts of righteousness/lawlessness, light/
darkness, Christ/Beliar (or "Belial," a Jewish name for Satan), and
believer/unbeliever end in the final contrast, "What agreement has the
temple of God with idols?" (2 Cor. 6:16, NRSV). The claim, "We are
the temple of the living God," is followed by quotations from the Old
Testament. Within these, three strong commands, "Come out!," "be
separate!" and "touch nothing unclean"! (verse 17) stand between two
"promises" (verse 16; verses 17, 18). Looking back to these promises,
the section closes with a call for holiness (2 Cor. 7:1).

   How is holiness before God related to separation from the
world? What kind of separation is Paul talking about? 2 Cor.
6:14-7:1.


   When we read 2 Corinthians 6:14-7:1 in light of his earlier coun-
sel, Paul is not suggesting that we do not have any contact with
unbelievers. After all, how could unbelievers ever have access to the
gospel? Paul, the great Christian missionary, does not want to dampen
the witness of believers. What, then, does he speak against? He speaks
against "all alliances that give undue influence to those who do not
love God." Any alliance with an unbeliever that risks the believer's
exclusive loyalty to God "must be strictly avoided."—Manuscript
Releases, vol. 8, p. 107. So Paul's call to separation in 2 Corinthians is
much the same as his earlier calls to "flee from sexual immorality"
(1 Cor. 6:18, NIV) and idolatry (1 Cor. 10:14).
   "It is all right for the church to be in the world provided the world is
not in the church. The ship does not sink when it is launched in the
water; it sinks when the water gets into the ship . . . . The rescue work
of the church declines in direct proportion to how much the world
invades the church."—Roy J. Fish and J. E. Conant, Every-Member
Evangelism, (New York: Harper and Row, 1976), p. 48.

    The word Pharisees means "separated ones." How do we
 avoid the extreme forms of separation practiced by the Phari-
 sees while preserving our devotion to God? How can we be in the
 world but not of the world?


                                                                       57

CHOOSING ONE'S YOKEFELLOWS (2 Cor. 6:14-7:1).

  To what situations should we apply the counsel not to be "mis-
matched with unbelievers"? (2 Cor. 6:14, NRSV).


    Chrisians often have repeated Paul's words to those thinking about
marriage with unbelievers. Ellen White agrees: "Men and women
professing godliness should tremble at the thought of entering into a
marriage covenant with those who do not respect and obey the com-
mandments of God. It was this that opened the flood-gates of sin to the
antediluvians. Such a connection with the world is a direct departure
from God's express requirements-13e ye not unequally yoked to-
gether with unbelievers.' "—The Signs of the Times, Dec. 30, 1880.
    However, Paul does not address his advice only to marriage. "The
apostle Paul declares that it is impossible for the children of God to
unite with worldlings. . . . This does not refer to marriage alone; any
intimate relation of confidence and copartnership with those who have
no love for God or the truth is a snare."—Testimonies, vol. 5,
p. 13.
   Other applications we might consider are:
1. Membership in secret societies (Evangelism, p. 617);
2. Inappropriate business relations (Historical Sketches of the Foreign
    Missions of the Seventh-day Adventists, p. 215); 3. Inappropriate
    involvement in politics (Fundamentals of Christian Education,
   p. 476);
4. Improper education of our children (Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 195);
5. Institutional collaboration with the world. "Let not God's people in
   any of our institutions sign a truce with the enemy of God and man.
   The duty of the church to the world is not to come down to their
    ideas and accept their opinions, their suggestions, but to heed the
   words of Christ through his servant Paul, 'Be ye not unequally
   yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righ-
   teousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light
   with darkness? and what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what
   part hath he that believeth with an infidel?' "—Testimonies to
   Ministers, p. 271.

   Compare Paul's advice on marriage in 1 Corinthians 7:12-14
with his advice in 2 Corinthians 6:14-16. Is he contradicting him-
self? Why or why not?

   Are you in danger of establishing any relationship that could
put at risk your allegiance to Christ? If yes, what should you do
to correct the situation?

PROMISES, PROMISES (2 Cor. 6:16-7:1).

   God has called us to develop an appropriate distance with unbeliev-
ers in matters that could threaten our Christian identity (2 Cor. 6:14-
16). For Paul, motivation to obey this call is found in God's promises.
God can fulfill these promises only if we remain fully loyal to Him.


   Reflect on the first promise Paul gives us. What should this
promise mean to us today? 2 Cor. 6:16.


   God's original plan, reflected in Eden, was for intimate fellowship
with His newly created human companions. But when God comes,
"walking in the garden at the time of the evening breeze" (Gen. 3:8,
NRSV), His search for fellowship is frustrated by sin. Later, the
tabernacle pitched amidst the camp of Israel testified to God's desire
to dwell with His people. The incarnation of Jesus provides even
greater testimony to God's longing for human fellowship. Jesus Christ
became "Immanuel, . . . God with us" (Matt. 1:23). In the closing
chapters of Revelation, we see the grand, end-time fulfillment of that
divine longing. John sees "a new heaven and a new earth" and watches
as the new Jerusalem descends. Then he hears "a loud voice from the
throne" with its joyous announcement, "'Now the dwelling of God
is with men, and he will live with them. They will be his people,
and God himself will be with them and be their God'" (Rev. 21:3,
NIV).

    What comfort and assurance does God's promise in 2 Cor. 6:18
bring to you as you resolve to put Him first and foremost in your
life?


   Reflecting on this theme of God's desire to be with His people,
Paul invites us to claim the promise now. This promise is not to be
fulfilled only in the new earth. It may be fulfilled to us in the present.
As we separate ourselves, sometimes painfully, from compromising
relationships, we have the promise of God's presence with us.

     Between the "promises" is the command, "Come out!"
 (2 Cor. 6:17). Review other scriptures that repeat this com-
 mand: Gen. 15:14; Ezra 10:11; Rev. 18:4. Think of areas in your
 life from which you need to "come out." In what specific ways
 will you do that?


                                                                      59

I WILL BE YOUR FATHER (2 Cor. 6:17-7:16).

   At what points in your Christian experience would the promise
of 2 Corinthians 6:17, 18 have been most meaningful to you?
(Compare Rev. 21:7.) Why?

   The second promise Paul provides makes fellowship with God
even more personal. " ' . . . then I will welcome you, and I will be your
father, and you shall be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Al-
mighty"' (2 Cor. 6:17, 18, NRSV).
   In order to follow Paul's advice not to be unequally yoked and to
"come out," perhaps some of his converts thought it best to break off
relationships with family members (see Matt. 10:37; Ps. 27:10). If so,
this promise would be especially meaningful. Whenever we give up
something we treasure because it stands in the way of our fellowship
with God, He is there to welcome us with open arms. Paul himself
knew this type of loss. He could say that, because of his devotion to
Christ, he had "lost all things." He came to understand that it was a
small price to pay for "the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ
Jesus my Lord" (Phil. 3:7-9, NIV).
   One inviting feature of this promise is found in Paul's use of the
word daughters. The Old Testament passage he bases his thoughts on
mentions only a "son" (2 Sam. 7:14). Paul wants women to know they
are full partners with God.

   In what specific ways does the Holy Spirit impress your heart
to apply the promises in 2 Corinthians 7:1 and 2 Peter 1:3, 4?
What difference would such application make in your life? What
import would this have on your witness for Christ?


   "The Lord Almighty" (NIV) Himself gives us these promises.
"Almighty" translates the Greek word that means "All-Powerful" or
"Omnipotent" and is used only of God in Jewish and Christian litera-
ture. Aside from several uses in Revelation (1:8; 4:8; 11:17; 15:3;
16:7; 19:6, 15; 21:22), this is the only other use of the term in the New
Testament. Would you expect empty and pointless promises from "the
Lord Almighty"?

     Explain how you have found rest in the arms of the One who
 is almighty. Think of two of your favorite Bible promises. When
 were they particularly helpful? What troubling areas of your
 life do you still need to give to the Lord? Can you think of any
 hindrance that may keep you from doing that?

GODLY GRIEF (2 Cor. 7:2-16).

   What things make you the happiest? Why? Compare the sources
of Paul's joy in 2 Corinthians 7:2-16. Why does Paul repeatedly
exclaim, "I rejoice"?


   On the heels of the "painful visit," Paul had written to the Corinthians
a "painful letter" that he worried about (verse 8). Paul had initially
planned to meet Titus at Troas (2 Cor. 2:12, 13). Not finding him
there, Paul went to Macedonia, where he experienced inner turmoil as
a result of worrying over his relationship with the Corinthians (verse
5). The encouraging report Titus brought when he finally arrived in
Macedonia did much to calm Paul. The Corinthians had welcomed
Titus "with fear and trembling" (verse 15) and true repentance. So
thorough was their heart work that Paul wrote, "I rejoice, because I
have complete confidence in you."

   In applauding the Corinthian believers for displaying "godly
grief," Paul mentions "worldly grief." How do the two compare?
2 Cor. 7:5-16, NRSV.


   "Repentance always brings a person to the point of saying, 'I have
sinned.' The surest sign that God is at work in his life is when he says
that and means it. Anything less is simply sorrow for having made
foolish mistakes—a reflex action caused by self-disgust.
   "The entrance into the kingdom of God is through the sharp, sud-
den pains of repentance colliding with man's respectable 'goodness.'
Then the Holy Spirit, who produces these struggles, begins the forma-
tion of the Son of God in the person's life (see Galations 4:19). This
new life will reveal itself in conscious repentance followed by uncon-
scious holiness, never the other way around., The foundation of Chris-
tianity in repentance. Strictly speaking, a person cannot repent when
he chooses—repentance is a gift of God. The old Puritans used to pray
for 'the gift of tears.' If you ever cease to understand the value of
repentance, you allow yourself to remain in sin. Examine yourself to
see if you have forgotten how to be truly repentant."—Oswald Cham-
bers, My Utmost for His Highest, "Repentance," New York, Dodd,
Mead & company © 1935—December 7th.

    Reflect: "The love and suffering and death of the Son of God
 all testify to the terrible enormity of sin and declare that there is
 no escape from its power, no hope of the higher life, but through
 the submission of the soul to Christ."—Steps to Christ, p. 31.

FURTHER STUDY: To learn more about "godly grief " and true
repentance, study Matt. 3:7-10; Luke 5:29-32; Acts 11:15-18 (the
conclusion of Peter's report to the Jerusalem Council and the reaction
to it); and Rom. 2:4.
    Read Steps to Christ, "Repentance," pp. 23-36.

   The following statement deals with Paul's counsel on marriage in
1 Cor. 7:12-14 and 2 Cor. 6:14-16:
   "He who has entered the marriage relation while unconverted is by
his conversion placed under stronger obligation to be faithful to his
companion, however widely they may differ in regard to religious
faith; yet the claims of God should be placed above every earthly
relationship, even though trials and persecution may be the result.
With the spirit of love and meekness, this fidelity may have an influ-
ence to win the unbelieving one. But the marriage of Christians with
the ungodly is forbidden in the Bible. The Lord's direction is 'Be ye
not unequally yoked together with unbelievers.'"—Messages to Young
People, p. 464.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Does "separateness" always mean "separation"? Explain.
     How can isolation from nonbelievers damage our true "sepa-
     rateness"?

  2. Paul says to avoid being "unequally yoked" with unbeliev-
     ers. We have taken Paul's counsel to include that a Seventh-
     day Adventist should marry only a Seventh-day Adventist.
     What is the wisdom of this counsel as it affects the mar-
     riage, family, and spiritual growth?

  3. In 2 Cor. 6:15, NRSV, Paul refers to Satan as "Beliar." Paul
     mentions Satan often in the Corinthian letters (1 Cor. 5:5;
     7:5; 2 Cor. 2:11; 6:15; 11:14; 12:7) and in the letters he
     wrote from Corinth (Rom. 16:20; 1 Thess. 2:18; 2 Thess.
     2:9). Do we, today, speak too much or too little about God's
     great enemy? Explain.

SUMMARY: Paul urges Christians to be totally committed to Christ.
Supported by the promises of the Almighty, we may free ourselves
from compromising relationships and accept God's gift of true repent-
ance from sin, just as the Corinthians did.

                     Come and Meet Jesus
                           John M. Fowler

    Kandy is a predominantly Buddhist city in the central highlands
of Sri Lanka. Members of the Adventist church there had not held
an evangelistic series in several years. But under the leadership of
a dynamic young pastor, they caught a vision of the needs and
potential around them, and decided to hold an evangelistic series in
their neighborhood. The congregation had little more than their
eagerness to share their talents for God. They laid plans to invite
their neighbors to "come and meet Jesus."
    The Adventist hospital and school worked with church mem-
bers to publicize the meetings and create a strong witness in the
neighborhood where they operate. With minimal advertising other
than word of mouth, the meetings drew an average attendance of
400 each day. The messages were presented in three languages:
Singhalese, Tamil, and English.
    One Buddhist woman attended the meetings against her husband's
wishes. One evening as she was about to leave for the meetings,
her husband again objected. Instead of arguing with him, she
invited him to join her at the meeting and see for himself the joy
she had found there. He went, but in the middle of the meeting he
began to feel ill. Some volunteers took him to a nearby hospital.
Doctors quickly diagnosed his illness as a heart attack, and their
quick intervention saved his life.
    The next day he told his wife that it must have been God's will that
he attend the meetings, for if he had stayed at home alone, there
would have been no one to help him. He likely would have died. This
 faithful Buddhist wife took her stand for Christ—with her husband's
permission—and was baptized at the end of the effort.
    In all, 17 new believers were baptized, and 50 others are prepar-
 ing for baptism in the near future. Of the 17 baptized, 8 were
                          Buddhists. They all live within one mile of
                          the church. Neighborhood witnessing that
                          focuses on the invitation to friends and neigh-
                          bors "to come and see Jesus" still works.

               The Ministry of
                 Generosity




Sabbath Afternoon

READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Cor. 8:1-15.

  MEMORY TEXT: "For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus
  Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became
  poor, that you through His poverty might become rich"
  (2 Corinthians 8:9, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: True fulfillment is found in meeting the needs
of others.

   NEVER UNDERESTIMATE AN EAGERLY GIVEN GIFT.
Tony Campolo tells the story of Teddy Stallard and his teacher, Miss
Thompson. She found Teddy difficult to love even though his records
told of his mother's recent death and his father's lack of attention.
Teddy's Christmas gift for her came wrapped in brown paper and a
maze of Scotch tape. Miss Thompson opened it to find a partly used
bottle of cheap perfume. She silenced the giggles of the other children
by putting some of it on and asking, "Doesn't it smell lovely?" Teddy
lingered after school that day to say softly, "Miss Thompson, you
smell just like my mother." Miss Thompson's heart broke. She be-
came more committed to her students, especially the slower ones and
most especially Teddy Stallard. By the end of the year, his perform-
ance had improved dramatically. And years later, when Teddy Stallard,
M.D., married, Miss Thompson sat in his mother's place.
   As Paul urges the Corinthians to be generous, he shares important
concepts with us. Among them is the thought that the size of a gift is
not nearly as important as the eagerness in the heart that gives it.

"THE COLLECTION FOR THE SAINTS" (2 Cor. 8:1-9:15).

   Early in his missionary career, what did the Jerusalem church
leaders ask of Paul? Gal. 2:10.


   "The Collection for the Saints," which is the focus of 2 Corinthians
8, 9, is an overlooked feature of Paul's ministry. On his visit to
Jerusalem, reflected in Galatians 2, Paul is asked to "remember the
poor," something he was "eager to do" (Gal. 2:10, NRSV). So eager
was he to fulfill the request that "the collection" may be described as
"Paul's obsession for nearly two decades."—S. McKnight, "Collec-
tion for the Saints," Dictionary of Paul and His Letters, editors,
Gerald F. Hawthorne, Ralph P. Martin and Daniel G. Reid (Downers
Grove, Ill. & Leicester, England: InterVarsity Press, 1993), p. 143.

   Paul deals with "the collection" in two other passages, one
written before and the other after 2 Corinthians 8, 9. What does
each passage add concerning this project?

   1 Cor. 16:1-4

   Rom. 15:22-33

   In Acts, we discover that Paul's final trip to Jerusalem was to
deliver "the collection." After his arrest, Paul told Felix he had come
to Jerusalem "to bring my people gifts for the poor and to present
offerings" (Acts 24:17, NIV). Paul seems to have collected funds for
the project from all of his churches. And the sum of money was
probably quite large. Aside from Corinth, donations came from Derbe
and Lystra (Acts 20:4), Berea, Thessalonica and Philippi in Macedonia
(2 Cor. 8:1-5; Acts 20:4, 6), Ephesus, Troas, and probably other cities,
as well. This was an international effort, directed by Paul, to relieve
the needs of poor Christians in Jerusalem.
   It also provided an opportunity for Paul to exercise his "ministry of
reconciliation." He hoped the collection would testify to the unity of
the church, made up as it was of both Jews and Gentiles. He hoped,
too, it would show that Gentile Christians recognized the debt of
gratitude they owed to Jewish Christians. "For if the Gentiles have
shared in the Jews' spiritual blessings, they owe it to the Jews to share
with them their material blessings" (Rom. 15:27, NIV).

   To whom do you "owe" spiritual and material blessings, and
 what do you plan to do about it? To what projects can I dedicate
 some of my time/money/talents so the gospel of Christ may be
 concretely illustrated?
                                                               65

AN EXAMPLE OF GENEROSITY: THE MACEDONIANS
(2 Cor. 8:1-7).

   In 2 Corinthians 8:1-7, Paul points out the example of generosity
provided by believers in Macedonia. Macedonia was not a wealthy
province. The Christians there were probably worse off than others
because they had been persecuted for their faith (1 Thess. 1:6; 2:14;
3:1-5; Phil. 1:29, 30).

  Study the following principles of generosity identified in
2 Corinthians 8:1-7. What other principles can you find here?
Which is most important for our own time and why?


1. Generosity is a divine gift. We cannot generate it ourselves
   (verse 1).

2. The poor and afflicted as well as the rich and famous can be
   generous (verse 2).

3. Generosity is voluntary, not forced. It looks for opportunities to
   give (verses 3, 4).

4. Christian generosity is based on totally giving oneself to God. It is
   not only gifts of money that may serve to soothe a selfish spirit.
   True generosity flows from a committed life (verse 5).

5. Just as they strive to excel in other virtues and gifts, Christians
   should seek excellence in generosity (verse 7).

   How can we recapture the spirit of generosity and sacrificial
giving so evident in the lives of the Macedonian Christians? On a
scale of 1-10, how sacrificial would you say your giving habits
have been during the past six months?


   Why not try one of the following? (1) Have your family choose a
person or family who has an obvious material need and begin a
"collection" to fill it. (2) Lead your Sabbath School class in adopting
an ADRA project that would stretch the class's resources.

   Lord, the pull toward materialism and self-centeredness is
strong. We never seem to acquire quite enough for our own
"needs." We imagine ourselves contributing our time, talents,
and money someday. Please grant us the gift of generosity today.

THE EXAMPLE OF GENEROSITY: JESUS (2 Cor. 8:8, 9).

   In sharing with them the example of the Macedonian Christians'
sacrificial giving, Paul has challenged the Corinthians to be generous.
Before turning to the grandest Example of generosity, Paul shares his
strategy in verse 8.

   Reflect on the incarnation of Jesus in light of 2 Corinthians 8:9.
Compare Philippians 2:5-8. How did Christ make Himself poor
for you? How does your own generosity meet the "test" of Christ's
sacrifice?


   Philip Yancey writes, "I learned about incarnation when I kept a
salt-water aquarium. Management of a marine aquarium, I discov-
ered, is no easy task. I had to run a portable chemical laboratory to
monitor the nitrate levels and the ammonia content. I pumped in
vitamins and antibiotics and sulfa drugs and enough enzymes to make
a rock grow. I filtered the water through glass fibers and charcoal,
and exposed it to ultraviolet light. You would think, in view of all the
energy expended on their behalf, that my fish would at least be
grateful. Not so. Every time my shadow loomed above the tank they
dove for cover into the nearest shell. They showed me one 'emotion'
only: fear. Although I opened the lid and dropped in food on a regular
schedule, three times a day, they responded to each visit as a sure
sign of my designs to torture them. I could not convince them of my
true concern.
   "To my fish I was deity. I was too large for them, my actions too
incomprehensible. My acts of mercy they saw as cruelty; my attempts
at healing they viewed as destruction. To change their perceptions, I
began to see, would require a form of incarnation. I would have to
become a fish and 'speak' to them in a language they could under-
stand.
   "A human being becoming a fish is nothing compared to God
becoming a baby. And yet according to the Gospels that is what
happened at Bethlehem. The God who created matter took shape
within it, as an artist might become a spot on a painting or a play-
wright a character within his own play. God wrote a story, only using
real characters, on the pages of real history. The Word became flesh."
 —The Jesus I Never Knew (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan, 1995),
 pp. 38, 39.

    Have you laid claim to the vast wealth that is yours as a gift
 from Christ, the One who was willingly impoverished? If not,
 why not?

                                                                    67

THE WIDOW'S MIGHTY MITE (2 Cor. 8:12; Mark 12:41-44;
Luke 21:1-4).

   How does God judge a gift? 2 Cor. 8:12. Consider the stories in
Mark 12:41-44 and Luke 21:1-4. How do they illustrate Paul's
principle?


    Aside from the incomparable gift of God in Christ, the widow's
memorable act is the case study of generosity in the Bible. During the
last week before His crucifixion, Jesus is tangled in controversies in
the temple. But somehow He manages to slip away from the strife and
sit opposite the temple treasury. It contains a group of thirteen collec-
tion boxes called "The Trumpets" because each is shaped like a ram's-
horn trumpet. Each of the thirteen is labeled with an "account" name.
Worshipers put an offering into the account, or container, of their
choice.
    After a while, she slips in, an island of poverty in a sea of pride. She
slinks along the wall, fearing someone will notice her. Except for shy
glances to this offering container, then that one, her eyes are glued to
the floor. She is alone. Her clothes are worn, betraying the miserable
status of an impoverished widow. Her face is scarred with hardship
and scored with misfortune. With no time or resources for luxuries,
she is hardly an example of personal hygiene. She is a lament for a
system gone astray.
    She finds the container. What was its label? Perhaps thinking of
someone even more destitute, she chooses the one marked "Poor
Fund." She slips a shaking hand into a bare-threaded robe. Jesus leans
forward. The glint of two copper coins reaches His eye—two lepta—
the smallest coin minted. The name means "thin one." Jesus knows
this woman has only two "thin ones" to her name. Her hand still
quivers. But her will is firm. With reckless generosity and astounding
faith, she casts, not one, but both coins into the temple treasury. Jesus
is so moved, He calls to His disciples. He points out to them this
special woman, and says, "Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put in
more than all those who are contributing to the treasury. For all of
them have contributed out of their abundance; but she out of her
poverty has put in everything she had, all she had to live on" (Mark
12:43, 44, NRSV).

    Compare and contrast your giving style with that of the widow's.
 What does her spirit of generosity teach you about your own
 experience? Do you give out of your abundance or out of your
 necessity? Do you give expecting some benefit in return or out of
 love to God and others?

GOD'S GIFT OF GENEROSITY (2 Cor. 8:10-15).

  What do we learn about "generosity" or "liberality" from Ro-
mans 12:3-8?


   In Romans 8, Paul regards generosity as a spiritual gift. He implies
the same view in 2 Corinthians, as well: "Now as you excel in every-
thing—in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in utmost eagerness, and in
our love for you—so we want you to excel also in this generous
undertaking" (verse 7, NRSV).
   Paul does not want his readers to think that the generosity he talks
about is merely a humane quality, a feature of civilized life. He wants,
instead, to challenge them with the thought that generosity must itself
be a gift from God.

   What additional principles of generosity may be found in
2 Corinthians 8:10-15?


   [Continuing the list from Monday's lesson]
6. If we make a pledge (either formally or in our hearts) to contribute
   our resources (money, time, talents, etc.) to God's cause, we should
   follow through (verses 10, 11). The Corinthians had, at an earlier
   point ("last year," verse 10, NIV), agreed in principle to contribute
   to "the collection for the saints." And they had, apparently, begun
   to raise the promised funds. Paul now encourages them to renew
   their interest in the project and fulfill their earlier pledge.

7. God does not require of us what we do not possess. He invites us to
   contribute what He has first given to us. It is not the size of the gift
   that is the essential element. Our "eagerness" or "willingness"
   (verses 11, 12) is the standard by which our generosity is measured.

8. Paul uses Exodus 16:18 to underline another principle of generos-
   ity—its goal—that is, a "fair balance." If we are experiencing
   "abundance," we should be prepared to minister to those in "need"
   (verses 13-15, NRSV). That God gave the manna in a way that
   supplied the needs of all is a model for our own generosity.

    If others knew the level of your giving, would you provide a
 model for them to follow? If not, how can God help you in this
 area?



                                                                       69
Friday                                                  August 21
FURTHER STUDY: God's Word promises that if we dare to follow
heaven's rules of generosity, we will prosper. Study Proverbs 3:9, 10,
27, 28; 11:24, 25; 28:8.
   Read The Acts of the Apostles, chapter 32, "A Liberal Church,"
pp. 335-345.

     "The Lord has claims upon every living soul, and those whom He
blesses with means should help those who are not thus blessed. 'For
ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich,
yet for your sakes, he became poor, that ye through his poverty might
be rich.' The followers of Jesus are required to practice self-denial, to
cultivate the same beneficent spirit that characterized our Lord. They
are to remember the poor, and be kind and sympathetic to the sorrow-
ing, and thus show that they are following in the footsteps of Jesus."
—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, June 26, 1894.


 DISCUSSION QUESTION:
  1. A relatively small portion of the earth's population con-
     sumes the greatest percentage of its natural resources. That
     is why we hear calls from Christian circles to adopt a "glo-
     bal lifestyle." How does the principle of equality (2 Cor.
     8:13-15) support this call?

   2. How should we relate to the needs of others when their
      poverty is the result of laziness or bad management?

   3. "The principle illustrated in the lives of worldlings is to get,
      get." How can we find the inspiration to model and the
      wisdom to pass on the principle illustrated in Christ's sacri-
      fice, "to give, give"?—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 339.

   4. There is more need in the world than any one person or
      denomination can fulfill. How should that fact influence our
      giving?

   5. Think beyond the financial aspect of giving. What else
      do you have that you could give?

SUMMARY: The eagerness of the Macedonians to give despite their
extreme poverty—and the willingness of Jesus to exchange divine
splendor for human poverty—should inspire us to seek after God's
gift of generosity.

                 Blessing in Blindness, Part 1
                         Charlotte Ishkanian

    Four-year-old Yi Yuen peeked shyly from behind her mother's
skirt and whispered, an xi ri kuai le [ahn shee ri KWEYE
"happy day of rest," the Chinese believers' Sabbath greeting. Chen
did not see her daughter's smile. Chen is blind.
   "I was seven years old when my eyes began bothering me," Chen
recounted. "My parents took me to many doctors, but they all said my
disease was incurable; I would gradually lose my eyesight."
    At first Chen tried to pretend that nothing was wrong. But at night,
alone in her dark room, it was easy to imagine what blindness was
like. Often she hid her face in her blanket and wept.
    Chen's eyesight gradually grew weaker. By age 13, she could no
longer see what the teacher wrote on the board; she was legally blind.
She enrolled in a school for the blind to learn Braille.
    Chen's growing blindness frustrated her. She poured her heartache
into music, sometimes practicing 10 hours a day. She mastered sev-
eral musical instruments. She allowed herself to dream of a musical
career, but her blindness prevented her from enrolling in a music
conservatory.
    One door after another closed for Chen. Eventually she was forced
to quit school and take work in a factory for blind workers. Frustrated
and lonely, she yearned for happiness and fulfillment.
    Chen's mother became a Christian and shared her faith with Chen.
The two attended the official Three-Self Church together. There
Chen accepted Jesus as her Saviour. Then she met a kind young man
and fell in love. The two were married, and Chen felt that at last she
was happy. A year later their daughter was born, and Chen could
almost forget the pain blindness had caused her.
    Chen's mother left China, and Chen began visiting other Three-
Self churches. But with her quick mind, Chen was bored by shallow
preaching. Chen began searching for greater spiritual fulfillment.
    One day Chen met Li, a friend of her mother. When Chen ex-
pressed her disappointment in the churches she had attended, Li
 invited her to attend a Bible study group at her church. But Chen felt
she already knew more than most ministers. Li challenged her friend
to answer the questions on a Bible study form. Chen realized that she
 could not answer any of the questions. "What church teaches the
 Bible in this much detail?" Chen asked.
                                                 (continued next week)

   Chen and her family live in Shanghai, China. Charlotte Ishkanian is
editor of the Mission quarterlies.

              "The Ministry to
                the Saints"




Sabbath Afternoon

READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Cor. 8:16-9:15.

   MEMORY TEXT: "God is able to make all grace abound
   toward you, that you, always having all sufficiency in all things,
   have an abundance for every good work" (2 Corinthians 9:8,
   NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: We are called to contribute our resources to the
cause of God, not to make ourselves poor, but so we might experience
God's blessings.

    HAVE YOU EVER GIVEN A GIFT FROM MIXED MOTIVES?
"Dear Jim," the letter began. "Last week I knelt at the prayer altar to
pray for every member in the prayer book, and I wanted to pray for
you. But your name was not there." The letter continued, its message
implying, "All manner of good things can happen to you if you will
only put your name back in the book. A few dollars in the envelope is
little enough to pay for that!" All too many "Christian" ministries use
such doubtful motivations coupled with the hype of television pro-
gramming and the so-called personalization of mass mailing.
    If Paul were to direct a fund-raising campaign, how would he
organize it? What would motivate him? What efforts would he invest
to make sure the event was above criticism? Second Corinthians 8:16
-9:15 gives us the chance to watch Paul the fund-raiser at work and to
grow in our understanding of what it means to use our money in "the
ministry to the saints" (2 Cor. 9:1, NRSV).

Sunday                                                August 23
THE DELEGATION (2 Cor. 8:16-24).

   No sooner have the Corinthian Christians renewed their loyalty to
Paul than he asks them to give generously to the "collection for the
saints." The project is obviously important to Paul, because we see him
doing all he can to persuade the Corinthians. Among the strategies Paul
uses is to send a delegation of three people to gather the funds.

   For what is the first "brother" who is mentioned known? 2 Cor.
8:18, 19.


   For what is the second "brother" who is mentioned known?
2 Cor. 8:22.


   Healthy church organization and finances are based on the hints
found in 2 Corinthians 8 and 9. Paul is interested that, in a joint
project, local congregations be represented. So he lays the ground-
work for representative church organization.
   Also, the integrity of church finances must be carefully guarded.
Between the introduction of the two "brothers," Paul states his moti-
vation in assembling the delegation: "We intend that no one should
blame us about this generous gift that we are administering, for we
intend to do what is right not only in the Lord's sight but also in the
sight of others" (verses 20, 21, NRSV). Each of the three delegates
was a capable person of noble character. Paul did not send three
because each was a questionable individual or because the safety of
the gift needed to be assured. Any one of the three would have carried
out the duties honestly and efficiently. Any one of the three would
have done what was right "in the Lord's sight." However, this project
was so important, its success so closely tied to the advancement of the
church itself, it was deserving of every safeguard. It must not only be
right before God; others must see it to be so.
   "Strict honesty may not always be sufficient in money matters,
where the least carelessness may become the occasion for criticism.
The Christian minister, especially, must exercise scrupulous care in
handling money matters."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 893.

    How can the following quote help to change any part of your
 behavior? "Everything God's people do should be as transpar-
 ent as sunlight. Escaping detection does not justify crime, and
 make it honesty and righteousness."—Review and Herald, Nov.
18, 1890. What does it mean to be "as transparent as sunlight"
 in your relationship with God and others around you?

                                                                    73

TITUS: A CHARACTER STUDY (2 Cor. 7:2-16; 8:16-24).

  Describe the mission of Titus to the Corinthians. What was its
goal? Did he accomplish it? 2 Cor. 7:2-16.


   What role was Titus to play in conjunction with "The collec-
tion"? 2 Cor. 8:6, 16-24. What high words of praise does Paul
write of Titus in 2 Corinthians 8:16, 23?


   The book of Acts and Paul's letters mention some one hundred
individuals as associated with him in ministry. Some assisted with his
preaching, teaching, or writing. Others provided housing or helped to
pay for Paul's mission. That so many were involved with Paul's work
shows his commitment to teamwork and the ministry of all believers.
Within this large group of co-workers, Titus held an important place.

   What role had Titus played as one of Paul's companions on an
earlier trip to Jerusalem? Gal. 2:1-3.


   On what later travels did Paul send Titus? What ministry did
he perform? Titus 1:1-5; 3:12; 2 Tim. 4:9, 10.


   Titus was with Paul from an early point in the apostle's ministry
(Galatians 2) to the end of it (2 Tim. 4:10). Paul called Titus his
"brother" (2 Cor. 2:13, NIV), "partner" and "co-worker" (2 Cor. 8:23,
NRSV). He addressed a letter "To Titus, my true son in our common
faith" (Titus 1:4, NIV). Paul placed great confidence in Titus and felt
certain of his love for Christ and loyalty to himself and the gospel he
proclaimed.
   The apostle "recognized in his trusted associate a forceful, diplo-
matic, yet winsome and tactful personality."—Frank Holbrook, "To
Titus, My Son," Adventist Review, Jan. 10, 1985, p. 9. The opposition
to Paul at Corinth required the exercise of just such skill. And Titus
proved equal to the challenge. His success may be due in large part to
the personal interest he took in the Corinthians and the genuine love
he showed toward them (2 Cor. 8:16, 17).

    Have you, as did Titus, dedicated your talents and capabili-
 ties to God? What is the mission God wishes to accomplish
 through you? How are you responding to such mission?

REASONS TO GIVE (2 Cor. 9:1-5).

  How does Paul explain his reasons for sending the three men to
Corinth? 2 Cor. 9:1-5.


   Paul has just boasted to the Corinthians about the voluntary gener-
osity of the Macedonians (2 Cor. 8:1-5). Now we learn that he has
been boasting to the Macedonians about the charity of the Corinthian
Christians. In fact, the Corinthians' eagerness helped to motivate the
Macedonians (2 Cor. 9:2). Paul has become fearful that the reality
may not live up to his praise. He worries about the embarrassment that
would result if he were to arrive in Corinth with some Macedonians
only to find that his boasts of them were empty ones.

   Paul wants the gift of the Corinthians to be voluntary. Yet his
own appeal is strong. How would you distinguish between appro-
priate Christian persuasion and inappropriate pressure?


    Listed in the order in which they appear in 2 Corinthians 8 and 9,
the motivations for giving could be summarized as follows:
1. That their generosity might be as "excellent" as their spiritual
   accomplishments in other areas (8:7);
2. As an appropriate response of thanksgiving for the gospel (8:9;
   9:11-13, 15);
3. That their earlier eagerness might be matched by eagerly complet-
   ing the gift (8:10, 11);
4. To advance a "fair balance" within the Christian family (8:13-15,
   NRSV);
5. To relieve the needs of poor Christians in Jerusalem (9:1, 12);
6. To avoid embarrassment in the face of a visit by Paul and represen-
   tatives from Macedonia (9:1-5);
7. To participate in the blessings of generosity (9:6-11);
8. To bring a new level of community to the church (9:14).

  Using the above list, which motivations would you regard as the
most significant? Which would you regard as the least important?
Why? What motivates you to give?


    How does the following text motivate you to give generously?
 "He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all,
 how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?" (Rom.
8:32, KJV).

                                                                   75

GOD IS A CHEERFUL GIVER (2 Cor. 9:6-12).

  What spiritual principle is active in the lives of those who give
cheerfully and generously? 2 Cor. 9:6-12.

   Christian liberality is rooted in God's generosity. That God treas-
ures the cheerful giver should not be a surprise—He Himself is the
cheerful Giver (2 Cor. 9:15).

  How can we determine whether we are being truly cheerful and
generous in our giving?


    A Christian journal recently published a list of questions for self-
examination. The list, titled, "Am I Greedy?" included the following
questions:
1. If I fantasize about winning a magazine sweepstakes, what most
    comes to mind is: (a) what I could do for others with all that money;
   (b) what I could buy, the vacations I could take, and the freedom to
    do what I want.
2. When I hear of someone with about the same talents and energy and
    education as I have who earns $20,000 a year more than I do, I
    think: (a) how nice that he or she can earn that much money; (b) it's
    not fair. . . .
3. When I give money to the church or other charitable organization, I
    typically: (a) think with pleasure about the good that may be done
    with my money; (b) think of the things I could have done with the
    money if I hadn't given it away.
4. If I lend $15 to someone I meet at a retreat: (a) I don't mind much if
    I never see the money again; (b) I get pretty upset if the person
    doesn't repay me.
5. When I give money to the church, I do so because: (a) I like to see
    the church doing well; (b) I feel it wouldn't be right to not give.
    —Christianity Today, April 8, 1996, p. 33.
   "It were better not to give at all than to give grudgingly; for if we
impart of our means when we have not the spirit to give freely, we
mock God. Let us bear in mind that we are dealing with One upon
whom we depend for every blessing, One who reads every thought of
the heart, every purpose of the mind."—Ellen G. White Comments,
SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1105.

    Think about it: "As regularly as the resources of the cheerful
 giver are taxed by his generous giving, they are replenished by
 divine grace."—Murray J. Harris, Expositor's Bible Commen-
 tary, vol. 10 (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan, 1976), p. 376.

FOOD FOR THE HUNGRY (2 Cor. 9:6-15).

  What is God's attitude toward the poor? Ps. 146:5-9; Isa.
3:13-15.


   In our study of 2 Corinthians 8 and 9, it would be possible for us to
focus on the need for contributing eagerly to God's cause and the
importance of integrity in church finance yet still miss a major point.
Paul's enthusiasm for his relief project invites us to consider our
treatment of the poor.

   What does God expect from His people whom He has blessed
with financial means? 2 Cor. 9:6-15; Ps. 112 (note that Paul quotes
verse 9); 1 Tim. 6:17-19.

   "God never meant that the widespread misery in the world should
exist. . . . The means over and above the actual necessities of life are
entrusted to man to do good, to bless humanity.
   "The Lord says, 'Sell that ye have, and give alms.' Luke 12:33. Be
`ready to distribute, willing to communicate.' 1 Tim. 6:18. 'When
thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind.'
Luke 14:13. 'Loose the bands of wickedness,' undo the heavy bur-
dens,' let the oppressed go free,' break every yoke.' Deal thy bread
to the hungry,' bring the poor that are cast out to thy house.' When
thou seest the naked . . . cover him.' Satisfy the afflicted soul.' Isa.
58:6, 7, 10. 'Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every
creature.' Mark 16:15. These are the Lord's commands. Are the great
body of professed Christians doing this work?"—Christ's Object Les-
sons, pp. 370, 371.

  Who should be the special focus of our concern when sharing
with the poor? Acts 4:32-35; 6:4; Gal. 6:10.


    Imagine a family in the church whose lack of skill and disci-
 pline in their personal finances is obvious. At this point, they are
 having difficulty putting food on the table. Which of the follow-
 ing strategies should the local congregation use? Can you think
 of others? (1) Provide emergency assistance until the family can
 apply for government aid; (2) Set up a mentoring relationship
 with a church family who exemplifies both dedication and suc-
 cess in managing personal finances; (3) Provide training in per-
 sonal finances, counseling with a Christian finance counselor,
 etc.

                                                                     77
Friday                                                 August 28
FURTHER STUDY: Using a concordance, look up the word poor to
find more biblical counsel regarding that topic.
    The collection, drawn from Ellen White's writings in Welfare Min-
istry, deals with our ministry to the poor. Note section VII of that
volume, "The Poor," pp. 169-208.

    "Money is a needed treasure. Do not lavish it upon those who need
it not. Someone needs your willing gifts. There are those in the world
who are hungry, starving. You may say, I cannot feed them all. But by
practicing Christ's lessons of economy, you can feed one. 'Gather up
the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost' [John 6:12]. These
words were spoken by Him whose power wrought a miracle to supply
the needs of a hungry multitude."—Counsels on Stewardship, p. 37.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. How successful was Paul's offering appeal (2 Cor. 8, 9)
     according to Rom. 15:25-27?

   2. We sometimes put our giving on hold because we do not
      have quite "enough." In light of the following proverb,
      think about the question "How much is enough?"
      "The foolish person wants more money, and more of the
      things that money can buy. The wise person wants enough
      money, and more of the things money can't buy—like health,
      happiness, love, and peace of mind."—Quoted by Deborah
      Bihler, "The Real American Dream," Business Ethics, July—
      August 1992, p. 46.

   3. Jesus said, " 'You have the poor with you always' " (Matt.
      26:11). Is it right to use this passage to downplay ministry
      to the poor? Why or why not?

   4. How could we use the principles of 2 Corinthians 8 and 9 to
      guide our giving? What should be our attitude, for instance,
      toward those organizations that lack clear lines of account-
      ability and a careful system of audits?

SUMMARY: With joy in our hearts for "God's unspeakable gift," in
Christ, Paul invites us to (1) reflect God's own generosity as we
support the ministry of His church; (2) urge one another to meet the
highest standards of integrity in financial affairs; and (3) minister to
those in need.

                 Blessing in Blindness, Part 2
                         Charlotte Ishkanian

    Chen's blindness had left her sad and lonely. She sought comfort
in God and attended several Three-Self churches in China. But she
found the teachings shallow. Then Li, a friend of her mother, invited
Chen to a Bible study group in her church. When Chen hesitated, Li
challenged her to answer the questions on a Bible lesson. When Chen
could not answer the questions, she agreed to go. She soon discov-
ered that there was much she did not know about God.
    Some of the questions on the Bible lessons puzzled Chen. "If God
commanded that His followers worship Him on a special day, why do
most Christians not worship on that day?" As Li and Chen studied
together, Chen found answers to these questions and many others.
She also found a closer walk with God.
    Chen began attending Sabbath services at Li's church. Because
she was blind, her husband, Hua, took her to the meetings and waited
outside for her. But Chen shared what she was learning with Hua, and
in time he began to join her in studying the lessons and attending
worship services.
    Hua became convicted of his sinfulness and accepted Jesus as his
Saviour too. Chen and Hua studied the Bible with Li and the pastor,
and were baptized together just a few months ago.
    Now Chen feels truly happy and fulfilled. Her husband, Hua, feels
peace in his heart that he never knew was possible. This young couple
has pledged to make Jesus the Lord of their home. Chen no longer
 cries over her blindness. She can look back on her life and see that
God turned a tragedy into a blessing.
    "Had I not been blind," she said, "I might never have felt the need
 for God that led me to attend church. And perhaps Hua would not
 have taken me to the church, where he found God too."
    Chen and Hua know that all things, even seemingly bad things,
                              can work for good to bring people to
                              Jesus. Chen is willing to wait until Jesus
                              comes to see again. For now, she only
                              wants to live in the center of God's will.
                              And for that she does not need physical
                              sight.

                                  Hua, Chen, and their daughter, Yi Yuen
                              (left), live in Shanghai, China. Charlotte

          Armed for Ministry




Sabbath Afternoon
READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Cor. 10:1-18.

   MEMORY TEXT: "For the weapons of our warfare are not
   carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds"
   (2 Corinthians 10:4, NKJV).

  KEY THOUGHT: In the use of spiritual weapons to spread the
gospel, Paul gives us an example to follow.

    GOD OFFERS US HIS OWN RESOURCES IN OUR MINIS-
TRY FOR HIM. In Paul's world, the Roman military controlled
warfare with its well-trained soldiers and siegeworks. Machines called
tormenta launched javelins, arrows, and rocks. In 1902, Kaiser Wilhelm
II built working reproductions of some of these machines. An arrow
shot from one hit the center of a target at 50 meters (160 ft.) and a
second arrow split the first!
    Faced with fresh opposition at Corinth, Paul responded strongly
(2 Cor. 10-13). In doing so, he lays claim to the stockpile of God's
own defense. However powerful the weapons of Rome, Paul knows of
still mightier ones. Military strategists would mock this stockpile,
which features "weapons" like truth, faith, and prayer. But Paul knows
their real force. In an age of Stealth bombers, space-based lasers, and
guided missiles, Paul's point is still true. God arms us for His minis-
try, not with the weak weapons of the world, but with His own
powerful weapons. As you study this week's lesson, ask yourself,
How well-armored am I?

LETTING THE ARROWS FLY: STRONG WORDS FROM
PAUL (2 Cor. 10-13).

  Read 2 Corinthians 10-13 through quickly in one sitting. How
does the tone of this section contrast with 2 Corinthians 1-9? How
do you explain the difference?


     These chapters have been called the saddest and the sorest chap-
ters Paul ever wrote. Recently they have been referred to as "a pas-
sionate, almost brutal defense" of Paul's authority and "a masterpiece
of savage irony."—Stephen L. Harris, The New Testament: A Student's
Introduction, 2nd ed. (Mountain View, Calif.: Mayfield Publishing
Co., 1995), p. 260.
      Marking chapters 1-9 is a sense of reconciliation and rejoicing
over the response of the Corinthian believers to Paul's efforts to
correct their waywardness. But in chapters 10-13, Paul is sometimes
on the defensive regarding his own reputation and sometimes on the
offensive regarding his opponents. These chapters contain some of the
strongest language in all of Paul's writings as he draws on a variety of
devices to make his point.
    Second Corinthians 10-13 may be outlined as follows:
   I. Paul Appeals for Obedience (10:1-18)
       A. Paul's divinely issued weapons (10:1-6)
       B. Paul's authority questioned (10:7-11)
       C. Paul's jurisdiction threatened (10:12-18)
  11. Paul's "Fool ' s Speech" (11:1-12:13)
       A. The "fool's speech" introduced (11:1)
       B. A digression: the church at Corinth as engaged bride and the
           "super-apostles" (11:2-15)
       C. Boasting as a "fool" (11:16-21a)
       D. Boasting of heritage and trials (11:21b-33)
       E. Boasting of visions and weaknesses (12:1-10)

ARE YOUR WEAPONS FROM GOD'S ARSENAL? (2 Cor.
10:1-6).

   What is the setting of Paul's remarks on spiritual warfare?
2 Cor. 10:1-6.


   In 2 Corinthians 10:1-6, Paul warns he may show "boldness" on his
next visit and "punish every disobedience." In between such warnings
(verses 1, 2, 6) is a description of the spiritual battle that he and his
associates are fighting (verses 3-5). On the one hand, Paul's work
reflects "the meekness and gentleness of Christ" (verse 1, NIV). But
on the other, he engages in spiritual warfare with weapons of "divine
power." With such weapons, Paul declares victory—"We destroy
arguments and every proud obstacle raised up against the knowledge
of God, and we take every thought captive to obey Christ" (verses 4, 5,
NRSV).

   If what Paul says about the divine arsenal is true, why does it so
often seem that "truth is forever on the scaffold and wrong for-
ever on the throne"?


    We may view 2 Corinthians 10:4-6 as following the progress of a
victorious army. As the army tightens its siege of a city, it conquers
the "strongholds" (verse 4, NIV). Then the invading army is free to
overrun the walls. No "obstacle" can resist (verse 5, NRSV). After the
army breaches the walls, they capture the citizens (verse 5). When the
leaders of the rebellion are punished, victory is complete (verse 6).
    Paul's converts in Corinth have personally experienced his use of
spiritual weapons. Believing a variety of ideas, they found Paul be-
sieging their own intellectual strongholds with the message of a risen
and returning Lord Jesus. That experience should have made them
think when Paul warned he would use God's weapons again!
   "When the gospel endeavours to penetrate the human heart it meets
with earthworks of prejudice, which men have cast up to screen their
minds from the force of the truth. . . . Let but the gospel come with
power, and all these citadels are laid low. Away they go, like Jericho's
old bulwarks, rocking and reeling, till in a cloud of dust they thunder
to their fall."—Charles Spurgeon, The Treasury of the Bible, vol. 7
(Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Book House, n.d.), pp. 267-269.

   How have your prejudices and opinions fallen before the
 power of the gospel? Which ones may still need to fall?

THE CHURCH MILITANT (2 Cor. 10:1-6).

   Paul uses military imagery as a way of explaining Christian life
and ministry. Reflect on the following passages. Then respond to
the questions that follow: 1 Thess. 5:8; 2 Cor. 6:3-7; 10:1-6; Rom.
6:13; Eph. 6:10-20.


  How can we know we are divinely equipped for the battle?


  How can we fight a spiritual battle and still express "the meek-
ness and gentleness of Christ"? (2 Cor. 10:1, NRSV).


   "Spiritual warfare" is presently a popular phrase in Christian
circles. According to Paul, what exactly is it? What are some
misunderstandings about this subject, and how can we deal with
them?


  How should we respond when the battle appears lost and some-
one turns away from God?


   The context of Paul's remarks have to do with his response to his
opponents at Corinth. However, Paul's description of his spiritual
combat can guide our own struggle against evil. His words invite us to
arm for spiritual combat and to reflect on the nature of the battle.
   First, there is a sense in which this battle knows no human foe. Paul
does confront his opponents. But the targets of the divine weapons are
not so much people as "strongholds," "arguments," "proud obstacles,"
and "thoughts." If we target the people who support harmful concepts
instead of the concepts themselves, we risk fighting "according to
human standards" (verse 3, NRSV).
   Second, Paul's victorious tone is worth some reflection. As we
engage in ministry on behalf of Christ, we too often become discour-
aged about the outcome. We would do well to focus less upon what we
march against and more on the weapons God provides.

    How can you begin doing so today? What are some of the
 "strongholds" you have been confronting? In what ways have
 you experienced God's mighty weapons pull down such
 "stongholds"?


                                                                    83

PAUL'S BUILDING PERMIT (2 Cor. 10:7-11).

   What new charges do Paul's opponents make? 2 Cor. 10:7-11.


   Paul is careful to make a distinction between his opponents at
Corinth, who are visiting from elsewhere, and the Corinthian believers
themselves. For his opponents, Paul seems to have little hope (2 Cor.
11:13-15). For the Corinthian believers, he hopes there will come a
time when their "obedience is complete" (2 Cor. 10:6, NIV).
   This distinction is clear when he writes, "For they [his opponents]
say, 'His letters are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is
weak, and his speech contemptible' " (verse 10, NRSV; compare 10:1;
13:10). That the first point (Paul's letters are "weighty and strong") is
a backhanded compliment is evident from the second point, that
Paul's " 'bodily presence is weak.' " That he is strong at a safe dis-
tance away from them, but weak when he is with them. The word for
"weak" may be translated "sickly" and likely has Paul's infirmities in
mind, as well as a retiring approach to opposition. One element of his
weak personal presence is his lack of style. They rebuke Paul's speech
as "'contemptible,'" a criticism that is reflected in Paul's later admis-
sion that he is "untrained in speech" (2 Cor. 11:6, NRSV; compare
1 Cor. 2:1-5).

  What is the source and purpose of Paul's "authority"? 2 Cor.
10:8; 13:10 (compare 1 Cor. 3:10-17).


   Paul makes two important claims. First, he claims an authority of
divine origin. Second, he argues he has exercised that authority in a
way that builds up the church. Anyone can claim to minister on the
basis of divine authority. Isn't it appropriate to judge the source of
someone's ministry by the results it brings in the church? That is, if a
person, claiming God's gifts of ministry, actually "tears down" rather
than "builds up," isn't it appropriate to question the divine origin of
that person's calling?

   "He [Satan] excites criticism, or insinuates doubts and unbelief.
The speaker's [preacher's] choice of language or his manner may not
please the hearers, and they dwell upon these defects. Thus the truth
they need, and which God has graciously sent them, makes no lasting
impressions."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 44, 45.

    How can we distinguish between constructive and destructive
 criticism? What kind of criticism do you tend to give?

THE LORD'S COMMENDATION (2 Cor. 10:12-18).

  On what basis should we evaluate ourselves and others? 2 Cor.
10:12-18, especially verses 12, 18.


   Many of us spend a lot of time and energy either evaluating others
or being evaluated. From our first day in school, the teacher compares
our performance with that of others. Employers are constantly assess-
ing employees. Loan officers spend their days evaluating the financial
soundness of would-be borrowers. However necessary such evalua-
tions may be in business and education, Paul argues that when we
assess the spirituality of others and ourselves, we must be extremely
careful. On what basis do we measure ourselves and others? If we try
to boost our spiritual standing by comparing ourselves with others, we
are foolish indeed! There is only one source for true commendation
—"For it is not those who commend themselves that are approved, but
those whom the Lord commends" (2 Cor. 10:18, NRSV).

   What missionary desire does Paul express? 2 Cor. 10:12-18 (see
also Rom. 15:22-29). How can you foster this missionary spirit?


   In describing his own missionary activities, Paul reflects nega-
tively on his opponents who have traveled to Corinth. When he came
to Corinth he was a pioneer. He was not trespassing on anyone else's
territory as they were on his. Rather than compare himself with other
laborers in the same area, Paul wishes to push forward the frontier of
Christian mission. Giving in to "righteousness by comparison" is no
temptation for a pioneer.
    Paul's missionary appetite cannot be satisfied. He seems always on
the alert for the next field of service, ever thinking about some unreached
shore. Paul's sense of world geography was incomplete—there were
entire continents to be won to Christ, of which he was unaware. How
well has the dedication to mission expanded with our greater geo-
graphical insight?

 ments with others? What impact can God's acceptance and
 commendation have on this situation?

FURTHER STUDY: Among the issues raised by 2 Corinthians
10-13 is how to employ God's gift of speech (including both speaking
and writing). Study Paul's counsel in Ephesians 4:25-32. Is 2 Corinthians
10-13 an exception to his rule that speech should always build up?
Explain your answer. How do you explain the strong speech in
2 Corinthians 10-13 in light of Ephesians 4:25-32?

    "The religion of Christ never degrades the receiver; it never makes
him coarse or rough, discourteous or self-important, passionate or
hardhearted. On the contrary, it refines the taste, sanctifies the judg-
ment, and purifies and ennobles the thoughts, bringing them into
captivity to Christ. God's ideal for His children is higher than the
highest human thought can reach. He has given in His holy law a
transcript of His character."—Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 63.
   "When the heart is softened and subdued by the grace of Christ,
there is peace and satisfaction in the soul; for the love of Christ rules
in the heart, bringing into captivity the secret motives of action. Then
the easily aroused temper is soothed by the oil of grace. The tumultu-
ous heart at the word of Christ grows calm. When there is a sense of
sins forgiven through the merit of the blood of Christ, and there is a
consciousness of union with Christ, we are encouraged to strive more
earnestly to correct every wrong habit, and our harsh manner will be
refined and cease to work against the sanctifying influences of the
truth, against the existence of the union which Christ prayed should be
manifested among His disciples."—Review and Herald, Jan. 2,1894.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What ideas would you judge to be most resistant to the
     gospel?

   2. Which term best describes the position of your Sabbath
      School class or local congregation? Of the Seventh-day
      Adventist Church as a whole? Your own situation? (a) on
      the march; (b) in retreat; (c) under siege; (d) AWOL (ab-
      sent without leave); (e) in active combat; (f) on training
      maneuvers.

SUMMARY: God longs to arm us for ministry with His powerful
weaponry. With Paul, we are always to be on the alert for some heart
that Satan has barricaded against the truth. Seeking God's commenda-
tion on our service, we shall become true soldiers of the Cross.

                       Now I Have Hope
                            J. H. Zachary

    During the 70 years of Communism in Russia, many people
stopped smiling. Even today, several years after the power of
Communism was broken, one seldom sees a smile on the streets. A
sense of gloom and hopelessness pervades the faces.
    When Global Mission Pioneers began working in Neftekamsk,
an oil-rich city in Russia, they visited people in their homes,
schools, and nursing homes. In one nursing home, where elderly
soldiers sat idly in wheelchairs or wasted away in dimly lit rooms,
they met 17-year-old Anatoli. His mother had died; his alcoholic
father had beaten him several times. To save him from further
abuse, authorities sent Anatoli to live in this nursing home, be-
cause the city did not have an orphanage.
    The Global Mission Pioneers invited Anatoli to evangelistic
meetings they were holding. The quiet young man accepted the
invitation. After the first meeting Anatoli was so excited that he
invited several of his school friends to attend. These youth, who
had been taught all their lives that there is no God, now heard the
Word of God for the first time.
    The Holy Spirit spoke to Anatoli's heart, and he responded to
the invitation to follow Jesus. Having known so much pain and
disappointment, Anatoli was thrilled to learn that God loves him
and allowed Jesus to die for him. Anatoli drank in the truth that
one day Jesus will come to take His faithful followers to a place
called heaven, where there is no suffering or death. With joy he
told us through the translator, "Thank you for telling me about
 Jesus and heaven. Now I have hope."
    It was too cold to baptize the new believers in a nearby lake, so
 Anatoli and 17 others were baptized in the city's bathhouse. Clouds
 of steam filled the tiny room as the new believers shed an old way
                          of thinking and living, and embraced a new
                          life of hope and joy. The Global Mission
                           Pioneers who introduced them to Christ
                           will stay in the city for six months to nur-
                           ture the new believers and introduce others
                           to Jesus, who brings hope to sinners.

         Engaged in Ministry




Sabbath Afternoon

READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Cor. 11:1-33.

    MEMORY TEXT: "For I am jealous for you with godly jeal-
   ousy. For I have betrothed you to one husband, that I may
   present you as a chaste virgin to Christ" (2 Corinthians 11:2,
   NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: We, the church, are engaged to the divine
Bridegroom. And we live in a time when our loyalty to Him is being
tested. Inspired by the thought of the wedding yet to come, we must
remain true.

    WEDDINGS ARE MARVELOUS OCCASIONS, causing deep
emotions. It was no different in ancient times. And Paul draws on the
setting of engagement and marriage to present a sensitive subject to
the believers in Corinth. Their loyalty to Christ is at risk because of
their fascination with the "super-apostles" opposing Paul.
   Paul, the friend of the Groom, is "jealous" for Christ, the absentee
bridegroom. He worries that other suitors are wooing the Corinthians.
At their conversion, Paul had arranged the engagement between the
Corinthian believers and Christ. Paul anticipates the wedding, the
second coming of Christ, as the time when he will have the honor of
presenting the bride, the Corinthian church, to the Bridegroom, the
returning Lord.
   How are you preparing for your own wedding to Jesus, your Bride-
groom?

PROMISED IN MARRIAGE (2 Cor. 11:1-6).

   What worries does Paul express regarding the Corinthian be-
lievers? 2 Cor. 11:1-6.


   At the opening of 2 Corinthians 11, Paul starts his "fool's speech"
(see verse 1). But he begins to stray from this speech (verses 2-15)
when he identifies the Corinthian church as the bride-to-be of Christ,
the Bridegroom.
   If we read the passage with modern weddings in mind, we may
miss the full force of Paul's imagery. In ancient times, both Jews and
Gentiles took a marriage engagement far more seriously than people
do today in the Western world. Now when two engaged persons
decide to end their relationship, they face no legal complications. But
in the ancient setting, engagement carried with it a legal status that
must be settled in court. Unfaithfulness to an engaged partner was
considered adultery. Thus, Paul's use of the engagement theme in
2 Corinthians 11 "stresses the seriousness and permanency of the
Corinthians' past encounter with God's elective love."—Richard Batey,
New Testament Nuptial Imagery (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1971), p. 13.

  With the help of the introduction to this week's lesson, identify
each of the following elements of Paul's imagery. What does he
mean by:
  the period of betrothal;
  "another Jesus" (verse 4, NRSV);
  picturing himself as involved in the marriage arrangements;
   the future "presentation" of the bride?


   Paul had participated in arranging the betrothal and looked forward
to "presenting the bride." In the context of ancient wedding customs,
it may be best to see Paul as identifying himself as the groom's "best
man." (See John 3:29, 30 where John the Baptist describes himself as
the "friend of the bridegroom," Jesus.) Such a one played a role in the
betrothal and presentation and also had a measure of responsibility in
guarding the bridegroom's interests during the period of betrothal. A
friend of the Groom, Paul is "jealous" that the affections of the bride
be reserved for the Groom to whom he promised her.

   In this period of engagement, how loyal are you to the divine
 Bridegroom? What have you done that could be disloyal? What
 should you do about this and when?


                                                                    89

PRESENTED TO CHRIST (2 Cor. 11:1-6).

   Recall a wedding that you attended or in which you took part
(perhaps as the bride or as the one who presented her). How did
you feel at the moment of "presentation"?


   The ancient wedding ceremony began with an evening torchlight
procession when the bride left her father's house to go to the bridegroom's.
The bride proceeded to the groom's residence on a litter, surrounded
by friends, relatives, and musicians. The groom's procession, includ-
ing the best man, relatives, friends, and more musicians met them on
their way. Imagine when the two groups met!
   The wedding blessings and ceremonies took place in the groom's
home for seven days or longer. The end came with the presentation of
the bride to the groom by the "best man."

   In identifying the Corinthian church as bride and Christ as
bridegroom, Paul refers to the Old Testament. See the following
passages: the entire book of Hosea, especially 2:19, 20; Jer. 31:31,
32; Isa. 62:4, 5; and Ezekiel 16, 23. Compare and contrast the
characteristics of the bridegroom with those of the bride.


   The Corinthian believers are living in an important time—the time
between their engagement to Christ (their conversion) and their "pre-
sentation" at the Bridegroom's return (the Second Coming). During
this time, Paul's opponents in Corinth are trying to steal the affections
of the Corinthian church members. The members' main concern (and
our own) is to remain loyal to Him.
   "Christ has made every provision that His church shall be a trans-
formed body, illumined with the Light of the world, possessing the
glory of Emmanuel. It is His purpose that every Christian shall be
surrounded with a spiritual atmosphere of light and peace. He desires
that we shall reveal His own joy in our lives."—Christ's Object
Lessons, p. 419.

    Meditate upon the following: "And I heard what sounded like
 a vast throng, like the sound of a mighty torrent or of great peals
 of thunder, and they cried: 'Hallelujah! The Lord our God,
 sovereign over all, has entered on his reign! Let us rejoice and
 shout for joy and pay homage to him, for the wedding day of the
 Lamb has come! His bride has made herself ready, and she has
 been given fine linen, shining and clean, to wear." (Rev. 19:6-8,
 REB).

"NO, THANK YOU" (2 Cor. 11:7-15).

   What negative things are Paul's opponents saying about him?
2 Cor. 11:7-15.


   The accusations include the following. Paul:
1. is bold at a distance, but meek "face to face" (10:1, 10, 11; 13:10);
2. lives "by the standards of this world" (10:2, NIV);
3. boasts too much of his own authority (10:8);
4. comes off badly when compared to the "super-apostles" (10:12-18;
    11:15, 12-33; 12:11);
5. has overstepped his limits in his ministry at Corinth (10:14);
6. has failed to accept appropriate support from Corinth (11:7; 12:13);
7. is deficient as a public speaker (10:10, 14);
8. does not love the Corinthians (11:11);
9. attempts to take financial advantage of the Corinthian believers
    (12:14-18).
    It seems strange that they accuse Paul of not accepting support
from the Corinthians. But perhaps two social expectations may help
us understand this. First, manual labor was frowned upon. Cicero
(106-43 B.C.) wrote: "Unbecoming to a gentleman . . . and vulgar are
the means of livelihood of all hired workmen whom we pay for mere
manual labour, not for artistic skill . . ."—On Duties, 1:150, 151. So
perhaps they attacked Paul for being a "tentmaker."
    Second, the wealthy expressed power by becoming patrons. And
refusing such patronage was tactless. "The Corinthians want their
apostle to have honor in society and want to share in that honor by
supporting him. So they ask whether or not Paul deserves to be
honored as a true apostle if he refuses to accept true apostolic sup-
port."—J. M. Everts in Dictionary of Paul and His Letters (Downers
Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press, 1993), p. 295.

  Does Paul change his practice and begin to accept support from
Corinth? Why or why not? 2 Cor. 11:7-12.


   Unlike Paul, the "super-apostles" did accept financial support
from the Corinthians. But Paul will not allow himself to be like them
by adopting their ways. In spite of social customs, he believes his
practice of "the gospel for free" is the wisest and most effective.
What can we learn from this that will help us in our ministry?

   How do you react when accusations are leveled against you in
 your ministry? What lessons can you learn from Paul?

IN DISGUISE (2 Cor. 11:1-33; especially verses 12-15).

   What negative view does Paul give of his opponents' work?
2 Cor. 11:12-15.


    Paul argues from the greater, Satan, to the lesser, Satan's workers.
If Satan's method is to appear as an angel of light, it should not
surprise us that his helpers appear in costume, as well. Paul provides
us with a timely reminder that not all things and all people are as they
seem. "Deceitful workers" still come packaged as "apostles of Christ"
and Satan's assistants as "ministers of righteousness." We must "prove
all things" and "hold fast that which is good" (1 Thess. 5:21, KJV).

   Based on your study of 2 Corinthians 10-13 so far, contrast the
view of apostleship and Christian ministry held by Paul with the
view held by his opponents.


    Paul and his opponents clearly disagree on the basis for judging
who is a real apostle. The opponents believed a candidate should have
excellent qualifications. Such a person should look good, speak well,
carry impressive letters of recommendation, be authoritative in deal-
ing with others, have a pure Hebrew heritage, experience many
visions and revelations (12:1), and perform signs and wonders
(12:11-13).
    Paul uses a "fool's speech" because, while he is willing to match
qualifactions with the "super-apostles," he believes their way of evaluating
Christian apostleship is poor. For Paul, an apostle should be judged by
a fruitful ministry (3:2, 3) and will glorify the power of Christ even in
his weakness and suffering.
   "We have here, then, two quite different ways of evaluating au-
thentic ministry. The one is triumphalist and stresses only the mani-
festations of power and authority without any place for weakness and
suffering. The other, while also affirming the importance of power
and authority, insists that these do not belong to the apostle himself
but depend wholly upon the activity of God who chooses to let his
power rest upon his servants in their weakness and to manifest his
power through the folly of gospel preaching."—Colin Kruse, New
Bible Commentary (Downers Grove, Ill.: InterVarsity Press, 1994),
p. 1191.

    Compare Christ's ministry to Paul's criteria, then his oppo-
 nents' criteria. Which of the two sets of criteria would you really
 rather believe in and follow?

PAUL'S SUFFERINGS (2 Cor. 11:16-33).

   When Paul met Christ on the Damascus road, what warning
did he receive regarding his ministry? Acts 9:15, 16. How com-
pletely did the warning come true? 2 Cor. 11:21-29.


    Paul shares a list of his hardships so people will know he is a better
"minister of Christ" (verse 23, NRSV) than the "super-apostles." For
him, his difficulties are a badge of honor. And he often discusses
suffering as it relates to ministry. He also lists his traumas elsewhere
in the Corinthian letters: 1 Corinthians 4:9-13; 2 Corinthians 4:8-11;
6:4, 5; 12:1. Paul did not believe his afflictions disproved his calling.
Rather, they helped to prove it. "For this gospel I was appointed a
herald and an apostle and a teacher, and for this reason I suffer as I do"
(2 Tim. 1:11, 12, NRSV).
    Paul developed a deep spiritual understanding of his suffering.
Through his suffering, God was showing the reality of Christ's death
and resurrection. "For while we live, we are always being given up to
death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus may be made visible in
our mortal flesh" (2 Cor. 4:11, NRSV).
    "In all ages Satan has persecuted the people of God. He has tor-
tured them and put them to death, but in dying they became conquer-
ors. They bore witness to the power of One mightier than Satan.
Wicked men may torture and kill the body, but they cannot touch the
 life that is hid with Christ in God. They can incarcerate men and
women in prison walls, but they cannot bind the spirit."—The Acts of
the Apostles, p. 576.

   What insight does 2 Corinthians 11:21-33 provide into Paul's
life? What specific event does Paul mention at the end of the
section and why? (Compare Acts 9:19-25.)


   Paul's list reminds us of our limited knowledge of his life. We
know of only one imprisonment before the writing of 2 Corinthians (at
Philippi, Acts 16:19-40). Yet Paul recalls "far more imprisonments."
Likewise, Acts describes only one shipwreck, which took place after
this point in his life. But he mentions three.

    How do you look upon a fellow church member who suffers?
 Have you really adopted Paul's view of suffering in Christian
 life and ministry? If not, why not? How can you let the Lord
 help you in this area?

FURTHER STUDY: We find wedding symbolism used elsewhere in
the New Testament to compare the relationship between Christ and
His people. Study the following passages: Matthew 22:1-14 (the par-
able of the wedding banquet; compare Luke 14:15-24); Matt. 25:1-13
(the parable of the ten bridesmaids); Mark 2:18-20 (compare Matt.
9:14, 15; Luke 5:33-35); Eph. 5:21-33; Rev. 19:6-10; 21:2, 9-21.
   Read The Acts of the Apostles, chapter 33, "Laboring Under Diffi-
culties," pp. 346-358.

    "The eleventh chapter of 2 Corinthians contains much instruction.
It reveals to us that men who are liable to view matters after human
eyesight may make very grave mistakes if they engage in a work that
God has not appointed, but condemned. That work is to criticize, to
climb upon the judgment seat, and pronounce sentence. How much
better would it be for the spiritual advancement of such to look well to
their own shortcomings and defects of character through watchful
examination of their own hearts, to try to remove from them the beam
of faultfinding, of evil surmising, of evil speaking, of bearing false
witness, of hatred, and accusing of the brethren."—Ellen G. White,
SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1105.
    Regarding Paul's work in Ephesus, Ellen White writes the follow-
ing: "Amidst the constant storm of opposition, the clamor of enemies,
and the desertion of friends, the intrepid apostle almost lost heart. But
he looked back to Calvary, and with new ardor pressed on to spread
the knowledge of the Crucified. He was but treading the blood-stained
path that Christ had trodden before him. He sought no discharge from
the warfare till he should lay off his armor at the feet of his Re-
deemer."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 297.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Paul's description of the Second Coming as a wedding is an
     attractive image. What other ways of understanding that
     event increase your longing for it?

   2. Study 2 Corinthians 11:28, 29. If leaders in our local churches
      adopted this model of ministry, how would it affect our
      congregations?

   3. How would you help a fellow church member who often
      unkindly criticizes church leadership in your presence?

SUMMARY: If we are genuine in our ministry, we will reflect the life
of the One for whom we minister. And we will show the same concern
as Paul, who called for Christians to focus their affections on Christ.

                 With Charcoal and Prayer
                          Tim Holbrook

   Sparks shot skyward as four men, brandishing blazing branches,
ran between the fire and the hut. Inside the grass-roofed hut,
villagers punched machete knives through cracks in the hut's floor
and walls to drive out the evil spirits. In the corner of the hut, an
old man waved burning ginger root over the stomach of a woman
curled up on a sleeping mat. A rumble of chants filled the night.
   Punsoray, lying on her mat, groaned, and the villagers redoubled
their efforts to chase away the evil spirits that tormented her. The
rising noise awoke student missionary Marisa Miller, sleeping in
the far end of the village. She made her way to the hut and
examined Punsoray. Then she hurried to our home.
   "A woman in Tanoy's house has severe stomach pain," Marisa
spoke into the darkness. Dawn Holbrook dressed, grabbed her bag,
and followed the narrow path to Tanoy's house. She found Punsoray
curled up in a ball, moaning softly. Dawn looked at Tanoy.
   "Is it OK to treat her?" Dawn asked, shouting above the noise.
Tanoy nodded reluctantly. Dawn mixed some charcoal into a glass
of water, then helped Punsoray sit up and drink it. Punsoray made a
weak protest at the taste of charcoal, then she lay down again.
    "May I pray?" Dawn shouted toward Tanoy. Again he nodded.
The spirits had not left; it was time to try something else. Dawn
prayed a simple prayer, asking God to heal Punsoray. Then she left
the hut, promising to check on her in the morning.
    The next morning Dawn walked to Tanoy's house to check on
Punsoray. But Punsoray was not there. Fear gripped Dawn. Had
the woman died? Had the family taken her somewhere? She began
asking, "Where is Punsoray? Have you seen her today?"
    "Yes, she is working in her kiengan (mountain garden)."
    "When did she begin to feel better?" Dawn asked, amazed. The
 woman shrugged her shoulders and turned to enter her house.
    Several weeks later a villager asked Dawn, "Do you remember
 when Punsoray was sick, and the evil spirits would not leave her?
 You came and prayed for her." Dawn nodded. "The next day the
 news was all over the village. Tanoy had been practicing his
 medicine for two hours without results. But after your medicine
 and prayer, the pain left her within 15 minutes!"
    We serve an awesome God, and we praise Him for answered
 prayer and the testimony of His healing power.

among the Alangon people in the Philippines.

        Strength for Ministry




Sabbath Afternoon

READ FOR THIS WEEK'S STUDY: 2 Cor. 12:1-13:14.

   MEMORY TEXT: "For though He was crucified in weakness,
   yet He lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in Him,
   but we shall live with Him by the power of God toward you"
   (2 Corinthians 13:4, NKJV).

   KEY THOUGHT: Even visions and revelations cannot compete
with the understanding that God is working in one's weaknesses.

   IN OUR WEAKNESSES, GOD GIVES US STRENGTH FOR
MINISTRY. Building codes for large structures often call for devices
that stop the spread of fire. Such devices include heating ducts that
have "fire dampers." These dampers have chains with a weak, heat-
sensitive link. When the temperature rises too high, the link breaks,
and the damper falls. The strength of the system is made perfect in its
weakness.
   Paul understands that, into his life, God has built weak links, which
protect against the fires of egotism. "Whenever I am weak, then I am
strong" (2 Cor. 12:10, NRSV). Jack Kuhatschek puts it this way, "If I
really got my wish for absolute strength, unlimited wealth, and total
competence, I wouldn't feel any need for God. I would never experi-
ence his faithfulness or discover his sufficient grace. I would never
learn to live in humble dependence upon him. . . . In fact, my feelings
of pride and self-sufficiency would make me believe I was a god
myself."—The Superman Syndrome (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Zondervan
Publishing House, 1995).

CAUGHT UP TO PARADISE (2 Cor. 12:1-10).

   Paul continues his "fool's speech." He has compared his qualifica-
tions with those of his opponents in two areas—his Hebrew heritage
and his labors and difficulties (2 Cor. 11:22; 11:23-33). Now he turns
to the area of visionary experiences. His opponents have apparently
praised their own visions as better than Paul's.

  What role should direct revelations play in the Christian life?
How do you feel when someone says to you, "The Lord told
me . .."? See 2 Cor. 12:1-10. (Compare 1 Cor. 14:26-33.)


   This passage raised a number of questions:
1. Paul says, "I know a person . . ." (2 Cor. 13:2, NRSV). Who is this
   person? Paul seems to deny he is this person (verse 5). However, in
   verse 7, he identifies the person who experienced the visions as
   himself, the one with the "thorn in the flesh." He uses the word he,
   rather than the I, to soften the offensiveness of this "foolish"
   boasting.
2. Paul describes being caught up to "the third heaven." What does he
   mean by this phrase? In ancient times, people thought "the heav-
   ens" were divided into spheres above the earth. They believed there
   were three, five, seven, or even twelve such spheres. Because Paul
   identifies the "third heaven" with Paradise, he must understand
   there to be three heavens. The point is this: He was "caught up"
   into the highest heaven, into the presence of God. Doubtless no one
   among his opponents can outdo Paul's experience.
3. What are we to make of Paul's uncertainty over whether his experi-
   ence was "in the body or out of the body"? (verses 2, 3, NIV). The
   experience was so overwhelming that Paul could not decide whether
   he had been bodily transported to heaven (1 Kings 18:12; Acts
    8:39, 40) or whether it had been a vision (Rev. 1:10).

    What does the following mean to your Christian experience?
 "All are not to the Lord in precisely the same way. Human
 beings are not to define, arbitrarily and narrowly, the charac-
 teristics of God's working on minds. It may be given to one to
 gain spiritual strength and discernment easily, while another
 has to contend with 'a thorn in the flesh' (2 Cor. 12:7), and at
 times is ready, apparently, to step off the heights over the preci-
 pice. Yet who dare say that God does not still love and regard as
 His child the one so sorely beset, and that His hand is not still
 stretched out to save?"—Ellen White, This Day With God, p. 67.


                                                                   97

PAUL'S "THORN IN THE FLESH" (2 Cor. 12:1-10).

   How unusual was Paul's experience? 2 Cor. 12:1-4.


   Paul argues for "the exceptional character of the revelations" (verse
7, NRSV). They were exceptional in their destination—the "third
heaven," "Paradise." And they were exceptional in their content—he
"heard things that are not to be told, that no mortal is permitted to
repeat" (verse 4, NRSV; We may compare the ban against sharing the
revelations to John's experience in Revelation 10:1-4).

   What was the relationship between Paul's experience and his
"thorn in the flesh"? 2 Cor. 12:7-10.


   Another question this passage raises is: What was Paul's "thorn in
the flesh"? Over the years, there has been quite a bit of speculation
about this. Some have thought of it as a type of spiritual harassment or
some form of persecution. Since it is a thorn "in the flesh," most have
believed it to be some physical or mental disability. On the basis of
Galatians 4:12-15, eye trouble is often suggested. Though the Bible
does not clearly identify "the thorn," Paul's point is clear. God used
"the thorn" to keep him from being too proud of his vision.
   How often do we crave direct access to heaven? How often do we
long to hear the unhearable and know the unknowable? Paul could
respond that he had experienced these things. Yet he had come to
treasure God's presence in his weakness more than his own presence
in the "third heaven." He came to treasure God's negative response to
his thrice-offered plea more than the thrill of his trip to Paradise!

   In the midst of what crisis or sickness have you come to know
the unequaled comfort of God's presence? Would you trade the
experience for a visionary one? Explain.


   The greatest joy of the Christian life is not to be caught up to God
in vision. The greatest joy is when God comes down to us and makes
His presence known in the midst of our weaknesses. Our exaltation is
no match for God's condescension.

  What would you say has been your "thorn in the flesh" to
keep you humble and dependent on the mercy of God? In what
ways has God's grace proved sufficient to you in the midst of
your weaknesses?

BUILDING UP THE CORINTHIANS (2 Cor. 12:11-21).

  How does Paul end his "fool's speech"? 2 Cor. 12:11-13.


  About what event does Paul worry? What does he fear? How
do you think he wishes the Corinthians would respond to his
concerns? 2 Cor. 12:14-21.


   In the last verses of 2 Corinthians, Paul is concerned about prepara-
tions at Corinth for his "third visit." His first visit had been during his
second missionary journey, which featured an eighteen-month stay at
Corinth (Acts 18:1-18). His second visit would have been the painful
one, during which his relationship with the church was strained
(2 Cor. 2:1-5). Paul writes 2 Corinthians from Macedonia on his third
missionary journey, to prepare for his "third visit" to Corinth (Acts
20:1-3). If we are to judge from the report Paul provides in Romans
15:25-27, his final visit to Corinth was successful.
   Paul is still concerned about the Corinthians' hurt feelings because
he refused to accept their support (2 Cor. 12:13). Strangely, an oppo-
site charge also seems to be circulating that Paul had been taking
financial advantage of them (verses 14-18). Perhaps some had sug-
gested that Paul's refusal of support was a cover for extortion through
his associates in arranging the collection (verses 16-18).


   What claim does Paul make about his motives? 2 Cor. 12:19
(compare 2 Cor. 10:8; 13:10).


   Earlier in 2 Corinthians, Paul already has asked the Corinthians to
imagine him making important statements about his motives in the
presence of Christ (2 Cor. 2:10, 17). Could you make such a declara-
tion about your motives for ministry? Does everything we do for
others spring from a loving desire to build them up in the Lord?

   Can we say with Paul that in "everything" we do in serving
others we do it for their spiritual welfare? Do we consider the
benefits that may come to us, or do we serve others simply for
their sakes?


    "We are speaking in Christ before God. Everything we do,
 beloved, is for the sake of building you up" (2 Cor. 12:19, NRSV).

                                                                       99
Wednesday                                         September 16
CHRIST IS POWERFUL IN YOU (2 Cor. 13:1-4).

   Paul plans to visit the Corinthians soon. What warning does he
give about this visit? How would you feel if you received such a
warning? 2 Cor. 13:1-4.


    Paul has just expressed concern over the many problems at Corinth.
He was troubled that the problems he had dealt with earlier in his
letters and visits may still be there when he returns (2 Cor. 12:20, 21).
Now he warns that he will come to Corinth to take bold action. He has
given such a warning before: "Choose, then: am Ito come to you with
a rod in my hand, or with love and a gentle spirit?" (1 Cor. 4:21,
REB). If he did not live up fully to the spirit of that warning in his
second visit, he promises he will do so on his third.

    Paul writes to the Corinthians, "He is not weak in dealing with
you, but is powerful among you" (2 Cor. 13:3, NIV). In what sense
is this statement a warning and in what sense a promise? What do
these words reveal to you about Paul in his approach to the
Corinthian believers?


   Paul has discussed "power" and "weakness" a great deal in
2 Corinthians. He believed that "power is made perfect in weakness"
(2 Cor. 12:9, NRSV). This understanding comes from his view of
Christ's work. The Crucifixion represents "weakness." But that event
must always be viewed in light of the Resurrection, an event that
demonstrates God's "power" (2 Cor. 13:4). Why can Paul, in his
weakness, promise to return to Corinth with such power? Because he
identifies both with the crucified Christ and the risen Lord: "For we
are weak in him, but in dealing with you we will live with him by the
power of God" (2 Cor. 13:4, NRSV).
   Though Paul's words seem threatening to the wayward Christians
of Corinth, we may still hear in them a hopeful promise: "He is not
weak in dealing with you, but is powerful in you" (2 Cor. 13:3). God
knows exactly what we need to help us grow in His grace. Do we avail
ourselves of what he longs to do in our lives? Whether our need is for
Christ's discipline or comfort, may it be so for us!

  How has Christ been powerful in your life and congregation
during the past year, month, and week? Prepare a testimony to
share with your class of how Christ's power was manifested in
your weakness.

THE TAKE-HOME TEST (2 Cor. 13:5-14).

  Paul commands his converts in Corinth to practice self-
examination. In what ways does this remain an important
Christian duty? 2 Cor. 13:5-10.


   Ellen White gave similar counsel: "You do not know your own
spiritual condition. You are lacking in every heavenly grace. You
should humbly and carefully examine your own hearts, your own
individual characters. You need to open your hearts that light may
shine upon your darkness, that you may see and understand your
motives. The apostle's injunction is, 'Examine yourselves whether ye
be in the faith; prove your own selves' [2 Cor. 13:5]. What is the
character of your thoughts, your spirit, your purposes, your words and
actions? Compare them with Scripture, and see whether you represent
the character of Christ. Go to Jesus humbly, and break your hearts
hardened by feelings of bitterness and hatred. Let the grace of Christ
soften and melt you that you may put away everything that is destruc-
tive of your peace."—Manuscript Releases, vol. 13, p. 87.


   List the benefits and risks of self-examination. Are there some
times when we should practice self-examination and some times
when we should not? Explain your answer.


    " 'Examine yourselves, whether we be in the faith' (2 Cor. 13:5).
Some conscientious souls, on reading this, immediately begin to criti-
cize their every feeling and emotion. But this is not correct self-
examination. It is not the petty feelings and emotions that are to be
examined. The life, the character, is to be measured by the only
standard of character, God's holy law. The fruit testifies to the charac-
ter of the tree. Our works, not our feelings, bear witness of us."—In
Heavenly Places, p. 131.
   Paul helps the Corinthians to write their take-home test. The ques-
tions he suggests they should ask themselves are: (1) Are you living in
the faith? (2) Does your life show you are completely aware that
"Jesus Christ is in you"? (2 Cor. 13:5, NRSV). Because Paul hopes for
a good outcome on the test, he concludes:

   "May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God,
 and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all" (2 Cor.
13:14, NIV).


                                                                    101
Friday                                           September 18
FURTHER STUDY: Many places in Scripture reflect the "strength
in weakness" theme. One such place is the letters to the seven churches
in Revelation 2 and 3. Take time to review these letters. Note espe-
cially the messages to Smyrna and Sardis. Think of other passages in
which you can trace this theme.

   Ellen White applies the need for self-examination (2 Cor. 13:5) to
parents. "Parents, as you deal with your children, remember that you
are dealing with a reproduction of yourselves. Therefore be sure to
examine yourselves, to see whether you are indeed transformed in
word and spirit."—Manuscript 79, 1901, p. 7 (Manuscript Releases,
vol. 7, p. 75).

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. Explain how Paul's "thorn in the flesh" was a "messenger
     of Satan" (2 Cor. 12:7, NRSV).

   2. Why does Paul include Deuteronomy 19:15 in 2 Corinthians
      13:1?

   3. Paul suggests it would have been better for the Corinthians
      to defend him than for him to have defended himself (2 Cor.
      12:11). Do we defend those who have sincerely taken part in
      ministry but still have been criticized? Or are we more
      likely to leave them alone to their own problems? If the
      answer to the last question is Yes, how can we improve?

   4. Paul's experience with his "thorn in the flesh" teaches us
      that God sometimes chooses to work through our weak-
      nesses rather than get rid of them. Is this just as true of
      emotional and psychological weaknesses as of physical ones?
      Explain your answer.

SUMMARY: We are not to conduct our ministry on the world's
terms. Rather, we are to follow Christ's own pattern. Instead of point-
ing to our own credentials, we are to allow God's power to shine
through our weakness.

                     A Daughter's Prayers
                           Esther Simbolon

     When Sanggulna Sihotang of Sumatra, Indonesia, was ready for
 the sixth grade, she enrolled in a school in a neighboring city. It
 was too far away to return home at night, so her parents arranged
 for her to live with a family near the school.
     One of Sanggulna's friends lived with the Simbolons, an Adventist
 family. Sanggulna visited them often and grew to love them. One
 day she asked them, "Why do you go to the church on Saturday?"
     "We worship on the Sabbath day as the Bible commands," Mr.
 Simbolon said. "Jesus says that those who love Him, keep His
 commandments." Sanggulna thought that made sense, and the next
 Saturday she skipped school and went to church with her friends.
 When she told her parents, they were angry. "I just want to know
 what the truth is," she explained.
     Mr. Simbolon invited her parents to visit the Adventist church.
 They went to church and were impressed. They allowed Sanggulna
 to live with the Simbolons while she attended school, and the next
 year she transferred to an Adventist school. Sanggulna became
 convinced that the Adventist Church taught the truth, and she
 wanted to share her faith with her parents.
     When she returned home for vacation, her father was not there.
 She learned that on his way home from working in another area, he
 had suddenly jumped off the train and fled into the fields, shouting
 wildly. Someone found him and had tried to care for him. Appar-
  ently he was possessed by a devil. He consulted a witch doctor, but
  he still did not get well. When Sanggulna learned this, she urged
  her mother and siblings to pray for Father. Not long after that, he
  returned home, apparently well.
     Then one day he became angry. He threatened his family and
  forced them to sleep outside that night. Sanggulna prayed ear-
                           nestly for her father to give his heart to
                           God. Her prayers were answered, and her
                           father has not had a problem since then.
                              The entire family began attending church,
                           and recently Sanggulna and her parents were
                           baptized. Jesus rules their hearts now; they
                            do not need to fear devils.

   MEMORY TEXT: "Therefore, having these promises, beloved,
   let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit,
   perfecting holiness in the fear of God" (2 Corinthians 7:1,
   NKJV).

  KEY THOUGHT: Paul reminds us in 2 Corinthians of the power
and motivation found in God's promises to give us hope.

   "NO MATTER WHAT, I'LL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR YOU."
In 1989 an 8.2 earthquake in Armenia killed more than 30,000 people.
When a father found his son's school flattened, he remembered a
promise he had once made to his son, "No matter what, I'll always be
there for you." So he began to dig through the rubble. Other parents,
along with the fire chief and the police, tried to pull him off. But to
each he asked, "Are you going to help me now?" No one did. He dug
alone for twelve hours, twenty-four hours, thirty-six hours. In the
thirty-eighth hour, he pulled back a boulder and heard his son's voice.
"Armand!" he screamed. In response, he heard, "It's me, Dad! I told
the other kids not to worry. I told 'em that . . . you'd save me and when
you saved me, they'd be saved. You promised . . . . You did it,
Dad!"—Adapted from Mark V. Hansen, "Are You Going to Help
Me?" in Chicken Soup for the Soul (Deerfield Beach, Fla.: Health
Communications, 1993), pp. 273, 274.

THE PROMISE (2 Cor. 1:19, 20).

  "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we proclaimed among
you, Silvanus and Timothy and I, was not 'Yes and No'; but in
him it is always 'Yes.' For in him every one of God's promises is a
`Yes.' For this reason it is through him that we say the 'Amen,' to
the glory of God" (2 Cor. 1:19, 20, NRSV).

  Who is the center of all God's promises? 2 Cor. 1:19, 20.


   Paul hears the absolute, divine "Yes!" ringing out in a fascinating
setting. His opponents have accused him of speaking out of both sides
of his mouth—promising to come to Corinth on the one hand and
withdrawing that promise on the other. Paul wants to be sure that,
whatever their views of his travel plans, the Corinthians understand
the gospel. God's word of hope in Christ is not doubtful but certain,
not deceitful but truthful.

   How are we to respond to God's promise in Christ? 2 Cor. 1:20.


   The gospel is God's invitation to which we are requested to re-
spond. The divine "Yes!" calls forth the human "Amen!" To us is
given the joyous privilege of declaring the "Amen!" in word and life
to God's gracious provisions.

  What attitude toward God's promises do we see among the
heroes of faith? Heb. 11:32-34.


   "We are pilgrims and strangers on this earth, looking for a city
which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God. The path in
which we travel is narrow, and calls for the exercise of self-denial and
sacrifice, but God has not left us without help. He has filled His Word
with wonderful promises, to strengthen and cheer His children. In
these promises He draws back the veil from eternity, and gives us
glimpses of the far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory that
awaits the overcomer."—Ellen G. White, Signs of the Times, August
22, 1906.

    Recall a time when one of God's promises strengthened and
 cheered you. What glimpses of glory did this promise help you to
 see?


                                                                   105

FREEDOM IN THE SPIRIT (2 Cor. 3:17).

   "Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is,
there is liberty" (2 Cor. 3:17, NKJV).


   Paul promises that the Spirit's presence brings "liberty." "Lib-
erty" for what? 2 Cor. 3:12-18.


   Paul shares this promise as he contrasts the old-covenant ministry
with his own, new-covenant ministry, which is an expression of God's
eternal covenant of grace. He writes that many of his fellow citizens
experience the presence of a "veil" as they read the Old Testament.
This "veil" keeps them from understanding the gospel. But "when one
turns to the Lord, the veil is removed" (2 Cor. 3:16, NRSV; compare
Exod. 34:34). Since Paul has contrasted the misuse of the law in the
old covenant with the role of the Spirit in the new covenant, he
emphasizes the promise "Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the
Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom" (2 Cor. 3:17, NRSV).
   New-covenant life and ministry are all about receiving and appreci-
ating the Spirit's presence. Gone is any attempt to live by a checklist
of "dos" and "don'ts." The life of a new-covenant Christian is marked
instead by freedom—freedom to share life, not with a checklist, but
with the Spirit; freedom to view the glory of the Lord; freedom to be
transformed into His image (verse 18). This thought stays with Paul,
for his last wish in the letter is that "the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
be with you all" (2 Cor. 13:14, NIV).

   How would your Christian experience change if you claimed
the promise of 2 Corinthians 3:17? In what specific ways would it
affect your witness?


    "How much joy we might bring into our life here below if we
 would but make these promises our own. As we talk of the
 mansions that Christ is preparing for us, we shall forget the
 petty annoyances that we meet day by day. It is our privilege to
 sing the songs of Zion now, to turn our eyes to the light, to bring
 hope into our hearts and into the hearts of others. God desires us
 to gather up His promises, that we may be strengthened and
 refreshed. Let us take our eyes off the curse, and fix them on the
 grace so abundantly provided."—Ellen G. White, Signs of the
 Times, August 22, 1906.

EVERYTHING HAS BECOME NEW (2 Cor. 5:17).

   "So if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation: everything
old has passed away; see, everything has become new!" (2 Cor.
5:17, NRSV).


  Have we taken as seriously as we should God's "new creation"
work? 2 Cor. 5:17.


   Arthur Custance calls Christians "a new kind of species." For him,
the new-birth miracle "is not a symbolic rebirth, like that achieved by
ritual in some pagan religions of antiquity and even of today. It is a
fundamental change in human nature, so great a change that it amounts
to a genuine form of speciation. . . . We indeed remain in the world,
but we are no longer of the world." Quoted in David C. Needham,
Alive for the First Time (Sisters, Ore.: Questar Publishers, 1995),
p. 63.

   Review these additional promises describing God's creative
work in our lives: John 3:3, 7; Rom. 5:8-10; Eph. 2:10; 1 John 3:1,
2. Which means the most to you? Why?


   "The important thing is to become united to Christ, to believe in
Christ as a personal Saviour, to live by faith in the Son of God. The
question to ask the soul is, 'Am I a partaker of the divine nature,
represented as being born again? Has a new moral taste been created?'
If not, the soul is in deadly peril. He who is born of God is a new man.
`If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things are passed
away; behold, all things are become new.' The old imperious will is
gone. The pride is cleansed from the soul. Selfishness is uprooted. The
quick, passionate temper no longer masters the man; for Jesus Christ
has brought the thoughts into captivity to Himself."—Ellen G. White,
The Signs of the Times, Sept. 26, 1892.

   Can you say the following about your experience? If not,
 what can you do to change it?
               "Every promise in the book is mine,
              Every chapter, every verse, every line;
                All are blessings of His love divine,
               Every promise in the book is mine."
                       —Let There Be Praise (Hagerstown, Md.:
      Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1988), no. 130.

                                                                   107

REAPING BOUNTIFULLY (2 Cor. 9:6).

   "Remember that the person who plants few seeds will have a
small crop; the one who plants many seeds will have a large crop"
(2 Cor. 9:6, TEV).

   Second Corinthians 8 and 9 is the strongest and longest offering
appeal in Scripture. You will remember that Paul is gathering funds
for "the collection," which was to relieve the needs of the poor Chris-
tians in Jerusalem. Paul believed this project would make real the
reconciliation he preached. He encouraged the Corinthians to be gen-
erous by repeating the above principle of sowing.

  How is this principle as true in the spiritual field as it is in the
agricultural field?


   "Liberality both in spiritual and in temporal things is taught in the
lesson of seed sowing. The Lord says, 'Blessed are ye that sow beside
all waters.' Isa. 32:20. 'This I say, He which soweth sparingly shall
reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also
bountifully.' 2 Cor. 9:6. To sow beside all waters means a continual
imparting of God's gifts. It means giving wherever the cause of God
or the needs of humanity demand our aid. This will not tend to
poverty. 'He which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.'
The sower multiplies his seed by casting it away. So it is with those
who are faithful in distributing God's gifts. By imparting they in-
crease their blessings. God has promised them a sufficiency that they
may continue to give. 'Give, and it shall be given unto you; good
measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall
men give into your bosom.' Luke 6:38. . . . As we distribute God's
temporal blessings, the evidence of our love and sympathy awakens in
the receiver gratitude and thanksgiving to God."—Ellen G. White,
Christ's Object Lessons, pp. 85, 86.

  Think of a time when you contributed more money or time and
energy than you thought you had to spare. How did God refill
your resources?


   "One may spend freely and yet grow richer; another is tight-
fisted, yet ends in poverty. A generous person enjoys prosperity,
and one who refreshes others will be refreshed" (Prov. 11:24, 25,
REB).

SUFFICIENT GRACE (2 Cor. 12:8, 9).

   "Three times I appealed to the Lord about this, that it would
leave me, but he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for
power is made perfect in weakness' " (2 Cor. 12:8, 9, NRSV).

  In what setting does Paul receive the Lord's assurance that His
grace is enough? 2 Cor. 12:1-10.


   In the conclusion of 2 Corinthians, Paul defends his ministry against
his opponents' accusations. In a "fool's speech," he compares his own
credentials to those his opponents offer. They are Hebrews. So is he
(2 Cor. 11:22). They are "ministers of Christ." So is he. But he has a
longer and more impressive list of ministry accomplishments and
hardships (2 Cor. 11:23-29). He ends this section of foolish boasting
with the humiliating story of his escape from Damascus—in a basket.
   He moves on to suggest for comparison his own matchless vision-
ary experience in which he "heard things that are not to be told"
(2 Cor. 12:4, NRSV). As with the previous section, he ends this one
with a story that, far from glorifying his credentials, displays his
weakness. Three times he prayed for God to remove his "thorn in the
flesh." But three times, God refused. Instead, He gave a most personal
and profound answer, which we also may claim: "He said to me, 'My
grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness' "
(2 Cor. 12:8, 9, NRSV).

  In what area or weakness of your life do you need to apply this
personal, penetrating word from the Lord? (2 Cor. 12:8, 9). How
and when will you make such applications in your life and service?


    "Closely to study our emotions and give way to our feelings is
 to entertain doubt and entangle ourselves in perplexity. We are
 to look away from self to Jesus. . . .
    "When temptations assail you, when care, perplexity, and
 darkness seem to surround your soul, look to the place where
 you last saw the light. Rest in Christ's love, and under His
 protecting care. When sin struggles for the mastery in the heart,
 when guilt oppresses the soul and burdens the conscience, when
 unbelief clouds the mind, remember that Christ's grace is suffi-
 cient to subdue sin and banish the darkness. Entering into com-
 munion with the Saviour, we enter the region of peace."—The
 Ministry of Healing, pp. 249, 250.

FURTHER STUDY: Look up the word promise in a concordance
and add to the passages we have examined in these lessons.

   "Comfort, encouragement, and support have been provided for
every condition of life. Let us rejoice in the love of God. Let us praise
Him who has made promises so royal. Let these promises keep our
hearts in perfect peace. Jesus lives. His hand is guiding us. Constantly
our hearts may be filled with the peace that passeth all understanding,
even the peace that Jesus gives: Let us make the promises of God's
Word our own. In times of test and trial these promises will be to us
glad springs of heavenly comfort."—Ellen G. White, Signs of the
Times, August 22, 1906.
   "He whose heart is fixed to serve God will find opportunity to
witness for Him. Difficulties will be powerless to hinder him who is
determined to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness. In
the strength gained by prayer and a study of the Word, he will seek
virtue and forsake vice. Looking to Jesus, the author and finisher of
the faith, who endured the contradiction of sinners against Himself,
the believer will willingly brave contempt and derision. And help and
grace sufficient for every circumstance are promised by Him whose
word is truth. His everlasting arms encircle the soul that turns to Him
for aid. In His care we may rest safely, saying, 'What time I am afraid,
I will trust in thee.' To all who put their trust in Him, God will fulfill
His promise."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 467.

 DISCUSSION QUESTIONS:
  1. What are some of your favorite promises in 2 Corinthians
     that this week's lessons did not discuss? Why do they hold
     special meaning for you?

   2. We measure sound in decibels and light in lumens. What
      scale would you use to rate the power of one of God's
      promises? Which of the five promises in this week's lesson
      is the most powerful on your scale?

   3. The promises we studied this week help us to recall major
      themes in 2 Corinthians. Take time to review the quarter's
      lessons. Which of the truths about God that Paul discussed
      do you want to remember? Why?

SUMMARY: In facing the joys and trials brought his way by the
Corinthian church, Paul demonstrated an important strategy for Chris-
tian living—claiming and clinging to God's promises.

        Russian Soldier Becomes Soldier for Christ
                             J. H. Zachary

   Far from home and serving in the Russian army, Igor Pashkin had
a lot of time to think. His lifelong acceptance of atheism wrestled
with the concept of God. Gradually he became convinced that life is
the work of a super intelligence. But who or what was it? He sought
an answer in the Russian Orthodox Church, but he had no personal
relationship with God.
    Igor returned to his home in Omsk and enrolled in the university
to study English. When he learned that an Australian pastor was
conducting evangelistic meetings in the city, he decided to go. It
would be a good chance to improve his English.
   He enjoyed listening to the English speaker. When he spoke on
the prophecy of Daniel 2, Igor recognized the empires that rose and
fell—Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome. This prophecy offered compel-
ling evidence that the Bible is true. From that time on Igor attended
the meetings for another reason: to learn more about the Bible.
    When the pastor invited listeners to follow Jesus in baptism, Igor
stepped forward. That night he told his wife of his decision to be a
Christian. He expected her to rejoice with him, but instead, she
became angry. "I'll not be a Christian! You must choose," she de-
manded. "It is me or God." Igor chose God.
    Living for God may make life better, but it does not make life
easier. His wife left him; the university refused to excuse him from
classes on Saturday; and Igor refused to break the Sabbath, even if it
 meant he would be expelled. He asked God to intervene, and rejoiced
 when the university changed its position.
    Igor longs to share the joy of his new faith with others, and has
 dedicated his life to missionary work. He preached to inmates in a youth
 correction facility and led three young men to Jesus. He and a friend
 held a two-week evangelistic series in a village nearby. On opening
                           night 300 people attended. Following the se-
                           ries, 20 persons were baptized. Recently he
                           translated for The Quiet Hour evangelistic
                           teams who are planting churches in unentered
                            cities of Russia. Between translating assign-
                            ments, Igor preaches the gospel to all who will
                            listen.
