       PROGRAM FOR FAMILY STUDY OF S. S. LESSONS.
    SABBATH.—(After church services or at the close of Sabbath.) Review
the lesson of the day by relating in detail the substance of the lesson, recall-
ing Scripture words and refereces. Read the lesson for the intermediate,
division for next Sabbath from the Little Friend, and learn the memory verse.
    SUNDAY.—Study the first half of the lesson in the following manner:
    I. Assign a reference to each member of the family, using the lesson
pamphlet to ascertain what references are used in the lesson.
    2. Then read the texts in their regular order, carefully considering what
each one says before reading the next one. Be sure to have each member
of the family understand the meaning of all the words in each text.
    3. Select two texts to be committed to memory through the day.
    4. .Repeat the memory verse.
    MONDAY.—Review the portion of the lesson already studied.
    I. Have each one name as many references as he can.
    2. Give each one an opportunity to repeat the two texts that were to be
committed to memory on the previous day.
   3. Assign each one a text found in the first half of the lesson, and let one
member of the family ask the questions from the lesson pamphlet, and the
others in turn read the answers given in the texts or in the LESSON
QUARTERLY.
    Then study the last half of the lesson in the same manner that the first
half was studied on Sunday.
    TUESDAY.—Repeat the texts already committed to memory, and ask
the questions on the last half of the lesson, being sure that all understand
the questions and the meaning of the words used in them.
    Select two texts to be committed to memory during the day.
    WEIONESDAY.—Repeat the texts already committed to memory, and
review the entire lesson by asking the questions in the LESSON QUARTERLY,
the Instructor, or the Little Friend, as may be thought best. The number
and age of the children would usually indicate which lesson help would be
the best.
    THURSDAY.—Read the lesson notes in the QUARTERLY and those in the
Sabbath School Worker, and any other helps that may be accessible, and re-
view the intermediate lesson in the Little Friend, or the one found in the
LESSON QUARTERLY. Repeat the texts committed to memory.
    FRIDAY.—Thoroughly review the entire lesson in the following manner:-
    I. Ask the questions as found in the LESSON QUARTERLY.
    2. Call upon different ones to give a synopsis of the lesson or the lesson
story in their own language.
    3. Have the references given by different ones, and have those texts
repeated that have been committed to memory.
    4. Give each one the privilege of questioning others upon the lesson.
    SABBATH.—Review practical truths of the lesson, repeat all the texts
committed to memory, and relate personal experiences in which the truths
of the lesson have been found helpful.
    (This program is simply suggestive and can of course be varied to suit circumstances, but
we do urge upon all the necessity of thorough, regular, systematic study of tht Scriptures as
given in our Sabbath school lessons.)

FOR SENIOR CLASSES                                 4th QUARTER, 1896



         LESSON I.—October 3, 1896.

 CHRIST'S POWER OVER THE STORM; FALSE MO-
           TIVES IN SEEKING CHRIST.
                      (Chapter 6, verses 15-27.)

                            QUESTIONS.
   I. AFTER seeing such a display of Christ's power, what did the
people purpose to do?
   2. How did Christ prevent this?

   4. For what port did they start?
   5. Had Jesus joined them?
   6. What sort of weather did they experience?
   7. Toward morning what unusual sight met their eyes? What
effect did it have upon them?
   8. What did Jesus say to them?
   9. How did they respond to His words?
  10. What effect did His presence have in completing the voyage

4                     THE GOSPEL BY    JOHN.
  14. After finding Jesus, what did they say to Him?
  15. What did He declare to be their reason for seeking Him?
  16. What food did Tae urge them to labor for? Who could sup-
ply it? Why?

                              NOTES.
   I. BY usurpation and fraud Satan had established his kingdom
 in the earth. Christ came to win back the dominion which had
been betrayed by man into the hands of Satan, and to reestablish
 His own authority over those who would willingly yield allegiance
to Him. So He preached concerning His kingdom from the first
(Mark i : z4, 15), of His ministry until His ascension (Acts i : 3);
but He found great difficulty in freeing His disciples' minds from
the idea that His kingdom was a temporal one, and in impressing
them with the belief that the kingdom which He came to establish
would be a greater boon to them than to be delivered from the
rule of the Roman power. The miracle of the loaves had made a
deep impression upon the minds of the people. " His teachings
and work of healing had already nearly convinced them of His
divinity, and this miracle crowned their growing conviction with
entire belief. . . . They quietly consult among themselves,
and arrange to take Him by force, and bear Him upon their shoul-
ders, proclaiming Him the king of Israel. . . . This, to the
faithful followers of Jesus, seemed the golden opportunity to estab-
lish their beloved Master as Israel's king." But this is entirely
out of harmony with the work which Jesu's came to accomplish,
and so He sent away His disciples, and then dismissed the multi-
tude. " There were men of strong minds and firm determination
in that throng, but the kingly bearing of Jesus, and His few quiet
words of authority, quelled the tumult in a moment and frustrated
all their designs."
   2. FROM another record (Mark 6 : 46) we learn that Jesus went
into the mountain to pray. " He needs that communion with the
Father which is His very soul's life, and the more so that the
hatred of the priestly party and the enthusiastic but unspiritual
admiration of the Galileans are more and more complicating His
position and embarrassing His work." " Our Saviour identified

Himself with our needs and weaknesses, in that He became a sup-
pliant, a petitioner, seeking from His Father fresh supplies of
strength, that He might come forth braced for duty and trial.
• . . His humanity made prayer a necessity and a privilege.
He found comfort and joy in communion with His Father. And if
the Saviour of men, the Son of God, felt the need of prayer, how
much more should feeble, sinful mortals feel the necessity of fer-
vent, constant prayer. . . . The life must be like Christ's life,
—between the mountain and the multitude."
   3. " HE could not maintain the heavenly life in His soul with-
out continually separating Himself from man, and communing with
His Father. . . . What a lesson or every Christian! . . .
Nothing can atone for the loss of secret and direct intercourse
with God. . . . The law of the heavenly manna, that what is
heavenly can not remain good long upon earth, but must day by
day be renewed afresh from heaven, still holds good. . . . It
is from Heaven alone that the power to lead a heavenly life on
earth can come. .. .        Christlike praying in secret will be the
secret of Christlike living in public."
 • 4. THE narrative in verses 16-21 is a perfect picture of the exp'e-
rience of those who are trying to get along without Jesus. There
was no lack of effort. They were "toiling in rowing," but the
fourth watch found them only "five and twenty or thirty fur-
longs " from their starting-place. But when they had received
Jesus, they " immediately " reached their destination.
   5. WHEN the people had come across the sea and found Jesus,
"they began to inquire how and when He had crossed the sea.
They were astonished when the disciples related to them the
events 'of the preceding night. The fury of the storm, and the
many hours of fruitless rowing against the fury of adverse winds,
 the appearance of Christ walking upon the water, the fears thus
aroused, His reassuring words, the adventure of Peter and its
 result, with the sudden stilling of the tempest and landing of the
 boat, were all faithfully recounted to the wondering crowd, amid
 frequent interruptions and exclamations of amazement. . .
 As soon as the discourse was ended, they gathered around the
 Saviour, questioning Him, hoping to receive from His own lips a
                    FOR MISSION WORK IN INDIA.

fuller account of His mighty work of the previous night. .
Jesus declared to them that they did not seek Him from any wor-
thy motive. He bade them not to labor for the meat which per-
ishes, but to seek for spiritual food, that wisdom which endures
 Into everlasting life."

               SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.
   I. IT was on a mountain that Christ gave the law, delivered
His longest sermon, was transfigured, ascended to heaven. Note
other important events which have occurred upon mountains.
What lessons have been connected with mountains as used in
comparisons?
  2. It is no new thing for Christ to control the winds. As God's
agent He had done it at the Red Sea (Ex. 14 : 21; 15 : io), and the
stormy wind fulfils His word (Ps. 148 : 8).
  3. In connection with the sealing of Christ by the Father, study
Lev. 2 : 4 (the meat offering anointed) and Heb. I : 9.
  4. Observe the displays of royal power and authority by One
who would not allow Himself to be made king.
  5. In what way is life through Christ again taught in this lesson?



         LESSON 11.—October 10, 1896.
                    THE BREAD OF LIFE.
                      (Chapter 6, verses 28-40.)

                            QUESTIONS.
    I. WHAT  inquiry did the people address to Jesus?
    2. What did He define the work of God to be?
    3. What demand did they then make of Him?
    4. What historical fact did they mention?
    5. What scripture did they quote?
    6. What error in their belief did He then correct?
    7. What positive teaching did He inculcate?
    8. How did He define the real bread?

  9. What request was then made by the people?
 io. What did Jesus declare that He was?
 rt. Who did He say would not hunger? Who would not thirst?
12. What former statement did Jesus call to their attention?
13. How many did He say would come to Him? How would
He treat them?
14. What was the declared purpose in His coming to earth?
15. What did He say was His Father's will?
16. In what other form did He repeat this same statement?

                                NOTES.
    I. IN His reply ,to the inquiry of the Jews, Christ presents the
foundation principle of all Christian experience. "He places
being before doing; because the spiritual tree must have life before
it bears fruit." There must be a change of nature (John 3 : 5), an
indwelling Saviour (Eph. 3 : 17), and then we can do (Phil. 4: 131,
yet not we (1 Cor. 15 : to), but God in Christ working in us (Phil.
2 : 12, 13). To believe on Christ is the all-important thing (Acts
16 : 31), but it is very necessary to understand the true meaning of
such faith. " Where there is not only a belief in God's word, but
a submission of the will to Him; where the heart is yielded to
Him, the affections fixed on Him, there is faith,—faith that works
by love and purifies the soul. Through this faith the heart is
renewed in the image of God."
    2. "THE works that Christ performed bore testimony to the fact
that He was God manifest in the flesh. . . . The believer is
by his faith united to Christ even as the branch is to the vine.
The influences and efficiency of the vine all reveal themselves in
the branches. . . . What Christ can do, faith can do." Thus
what God requires of us is summed up in true faith. This includes
the self-denial (Matt. 16: 24), the submission (Rom. to : 3), and the
yielding (Rom. 6 : 16), that the fruits of righteousness (Phil. I : it)
may appear in us.
    3. THE rabbis taught that the Messiah when He came would
 renew the gift of manna, which may explain the reference made
 to the• giving of the manna in the inquiry made by the Jews. "His
 life was one continual miracle, but they knew it not, and demanded
                    FOR MISSION WORK IN INDIA.
8                      THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

that He should show them a miracle." Their inquiry was virtually
saying, "If you are sent from God, we may surely expect you to
rival Moses'" Jesus answers their very thoughts, saying : " Not
Moses gave you the bread out of the heaven; but My Father gives
you the bread out of heaven, the real bread." "As to the Samar-
itan woman, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so now to the
Galileans, Jesus manifests Himself as sent to communicate to man
life eternal. . . . What is there in Christ which constitutes
Him the Bread of Life? There is, first of all, that which He Him-
self constantly presses, that He is sent by the Father, that He
comes out of heaven, bringing from the Father a new source of
life into the world. . . . Christ is the Bread from heaven, be-
cause in Christ God gives Himself to us, that by His life we may
live." Christ is the "Desire of all nations" (Hag. 2 : 7), that which
meets the longing of the human soul ; and so those who receive
Him are satisfied.
   4. " IF, on the one hand, it is true that all the given ones shall
come, it is also true, on•the other hand, that all who come are in-
cluded among the given ones. Would you know whether you are
one of these? Ask yourself if you have truly come to Christ, or
believed in Him as Saviour, Friend, and King." Men may cast
out the believer in Jesus (John 9:34), but the Saviour will never
do so. This is but carrying out God's will (Matt. 18: t4), whose
heart embraces all (2 Peter 3:9), and who in Christ invites all
(Matt. 11:28).
   5. " IT is not enough to impart eternal life. That would bless
the spirit, but leave the body untouched. And the Saviour will not
rest until the whole of our complex nature shares the emancipa-
tion and blessing of His salvation. A transfigured manhood and a
glorified body must be the crown of His work for His own; and so
by His mighty power, He will raise us up in the likeness of His
glory, and make us the sharers of His royal and exalted state.
 Phil. 3: 21." " Christ gives eternal life. . . . The life which
man forfeited in Eden is given back in the second Man, the Lord
from heaven. . . . We can not explain the mystery of the im-
parting of this eternal life; and we know as liitle of the life itself.
We are sure that it can not be acquired, but must be given. We
are sure that life is not the result of knowledge, but knowledge

the result of life. . . . And we know that by this the religion
of the Bible is distinguished from all other religions whatsoever,
that it provides for the communication of this life to all who be-
lieve. Whatever a man professes and knows, without this life he
is no Christian."
   6. HE who " seeth the Son and believeth on Him," is the one
who looks with the eye of faith. Moses saw Christ in this way.
Heb. it : 27. "He saw Jesus as his Saviour, and he believed
that the Saviour's merits would be imputed to him. This faith
was to Moses no guesswork; it was a reality. This is the kind of
faith we need,—faith that will endure the test." "Look unto
Me and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth."

              SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.

  I. STUDY   the meaning of the word "true" as used in this gospel.
Compare the "True Light," the "True Bread,"the "True Vine."
  2. What is the force of the present tense in verse 33?
  3. Observe that throughout this lesson Christ sets Himself
forth as the very heart and life of Christianity. A personal Sav-
iour is the need of every individual.
  4. Compare bread in its power to sustain life, as containing all
necessary food elements, with other kinds of food, and note the
force of the statement, "I am the Bread of Life."

  13. In what words is this same teaching repeated.? What did
Jesus declare the living Bread to be?
  14. What effect did this teaching have upon His hearers? With
what inquiry did they reveal their unbelief?
  15. In what way did Jesus teach that life must be obtained?
  16. What assurance did He then give them? What promise did
He make?
  17. What did He declare to be true food? True drink?

bread?
  21. Where did Christ teach these things?


                             NOTES.

   I. THE plain declarations of Jesus concerning Himself and His
work greatly stirred the Jews. "Their jealousy was aroused, that
this man of humble birth was able to work wonders that they
could not explain away, and teach truths that could not be contra-
dicted. So they endeavored to awaken the prejudice and unbe-
lief of the people by referring scornfully to the lowly origin of
Jesus. . . . They contemptuously referred to His life as a Gali-
        SABBATH SCHOOL CONTRIBUTIONS THIS QUARTER

lean laborer, and to His family as being poor and lowly. They de-
clared that the lofty claims of this uneducated carpenter should at
once be repudiated. But Jesus . . . again, in more forcible
language, declared His connection with the Father, and the neces-
sity for the heart to be enlightened by the Spirit of God before it
 can feel the need of a Saviour."
   2. JESUS "declared unto them that the temporal food then given
them from heaven was but a meager gift compared with the bless-
ing of eternal life which he now offered them. The food eaten
then sustained the strength, but did not prevent the approach of
death, nor insure immortal life. The Bread that the Son of God
offered to man was death-destroying, giving in the end immortal
life to the body. . . . He declared that as temporal bread im-
parts health and strength to the body, so will faith in Christ and
obedience to His teachings give spiritual vigor to the soul, and life
everlasting." In His statement concerning giving His flesh for the
life of the world, Christ "points forward to His approaching death,
the only true propitiation for the sins of humanity."
  3. "THE connection between Christ and us must be of the clos-
est possible kind, so close that the assimilation of the food we eat
is not too strong a figure to express• it. . . . We eat His flesh
when we use in our own behalf the death of Christ, and take the
blessings it has made possible to us; when we accept the forgive-
ness of sins, enter into the love of God, and adopt as our own the
spirit of the cross. . . . The figure of eating reminds us that
receptance of Christ is'an act which each man must do for himself.
No other man can eat for me. It also reminds us that as the food
we eat is distributed, without our will or supervision, to every part
of the body, giving light to the eye and strength to the arm, making
bone or skin in one place, nerve or blood-vessel in another, so, if
only we make Christ our own, the life that is in Him suffices for all
the requirements of human nature and human duty."
  4. CHRIST in His humanity lived a life of dependence upon the
Father. This He did, not of necessity, but of choice, that He might
be a perfect example to us. He did not exchange His divinity
for humanity, but, clothing His divinity with humanity, He

12                    THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

emptied Himself, and did not avail Himself of His divine attri-
butes in His contest with evil. As Son of man, through a life of
compittt•- treptfideriee- upon the Fattier, He won 'back the glory and
exaltation which belonged to Him as the Son of God. And not
only this, but He won for us in our human nature a life of victory
over evil, and made it possible for us to live the life which He lived.
This involved His death; for "the life which He had before His .
death was fair, but not communicable; that which He won in death
and its defeat is fairer still, and capable of being given to all who
hear and obey His invitation to come." Christ's life cf voluntary
dependence demonstrated that it is possible for humanity, through
the provisions of God's grace, to render perfect obedience to the
law of God, and forever silenced the charge that God required
more of His creatures than it was possible for them to render.
Christ in His humanity, subject to all the conditions and limitations
of humanity, obeyed perfectly that law which He in His divinity
had proclaimed with His own voice from Sinai, and thus won for
us a life of obedience, which, as our High Priest, He ministers to
all who yield themselves to Him. "Great is the mystery of
godliness."

               SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.

  i. How many are drawn to Christ? Who will be responsible if
any do not come?
  2. Emphasize the difference between the present possession of.
"everlasting life" and being made immortal.
  3. Study the force of the word "living" in verse 51. Compare
Rev. I : 18, etc,
  4. The marginal reading of the Revised Version of verse 55 is
"For My flesh is true meat, and My blood is true drink." Apply
the previous study of the word "true."
  5. Is there any connection between the showbread of the taber-
nacle and the "Living Bread"?
  6. Compare "the bread which cometh," of verse 5o, with
"every word that proceedeth," of Matt. 4: 4.

       LESSON IV.--October 24, 1896.
                      SPIRIT AND LIFE.
                       (Chapter 6, verses 6o-71.)

                            QUESTIONS.
   I. WHAT effect had this teaching of Jesus upon His disciples?
   2. Did they need to give expression to their unbelief? What

                               NOTES.
  I. MANY of the same company which was fed with "the meat
which perisheth" have now been fed with "that meat which en-
dureth unto everlasting life," but the very ones who were then
ready to "take Him by force to make Him king," now pro-
nounce His discourse in the synagogue a hard one. His teaching
had the evidently intended effect of making a separation among
His followers, and of revealing their own motives to those who
were seeking Him because of the loaves. The man in the par-

able regarded his lord as a "hard man" (Matt. 25 : 24), and did
not make a right use of the talents delivered to him; so these
selfish followers.regard His saying..asa,iiArrlanef i       uot re-
main with Him longer. "Great crowds are following Him to be
healed and to be fed, while the politically inclined have at last
made a distinct effort to make Him king, to force Him into a
collision with the authorities. His proper work is in danger of
being lost sight of. He finds it necessary to sift the crowds who
follow Him. And He does so by addressing them in terms which
can be acceptable only to truly spiritual men—by plainly assuring
them that He was among them, not to give them political privi-
leges and the bread that perisheth, but the bread that . endureth.
. . . They seek earth, and Heaven is thrust upon them. They
turn away disappointed, and many walk no more with Him."
   2. "SoME may question the wisdom of Jesus in introducing a
subject so easily misunderstood as that which turned so many
from Him on this occasion. But He had a purpose in view. He
saw that a most trying ordeal awaited His disciples in His betrayal,
His agony in Gethsemane, and His crucifixion. He knew who
among His followers were unbelieving and who were of weak faith.
Had no test been given them, Jesus would have had many among
His followers who were weak in character, and undecided.
When the great trial came, and their Lord was betrayed and con-
demned in the judgment hall; when He was humiliated, and the
multitude, who had hailed Him as their king, hissed at Him and
reviled Him; when the cruel, jeering crowd cried, 'Crucify Him!'
then these faint-hearted ones would have sunk beneath their fear
and disappointment. The apostasy of these professed followers
of Christ at such a time would have been more than the twelve
could have endured, in addition to their great grief and the ruin
of their fondest hopes. . . . But Jesus brought about this
crisis while He was still present to comfort and strengthen His
chosen, and prepare them for what was to follow."
   3. " 'IT is the Spirit that quickeneth;' in these words and the
corresponding ones of Paul, 'The Spirit giveth life,' we have the
nearest approach to what may be called a definition of the Spirit
. . . as a life-giving principle. ["The Spirit is what gives
life."] In contrast to the Spirit our Lord places the flesh. . . .

It is the power in which the natural man, or even the believer
who does not fully yield to the Spirit, seeks to serve God, or to
know and possess divine things. . . . His words are spirit
and life; they are not meant for the understanding, but for the
life. . . . They have themselves a divine life, working out
effectually with a divine energy the truth they express into . the
experience of those who receive them. . . . Not into the
mind only, nor into the feelings, nor even into the will alone, must
the word be taken, but through them into the life. . . . It is
the Spirit that comes from God, the Spirit that Christ came to
bring, becoming our life, that will make them become the truth
and power in us. . . . The Holy Spirit has for all ages em-
bodied the thoughts of God in the written word, and lives now
kir this very purpose in our hearts, there to reveal the power and
meaning of that word. . . . The Scriptures, which were spoken
by holy men of old as they were moved by the Holy Spirit,
can only be understood by holy men as they are taught by the
same Spirit."
   4. ENOCH walked with God (Gen. 5 : 22) when God was the in-
visible One, but when He was manifested in the flesh, those who
listened to His gracious words refused to walk with Him, but
went "away behind." When, under special tests, many are turn-
ing away from Christ and are showing that their professions are an
empty form, and "the question comes to us, as in Providence it
does, 'Will ye also go away?' we must have our answer ready."
    5. "AND we have believed and know that Thou art the Holy
One of God." Verse 69, R. V. Knowledge of Christ as the Holy
One is the result of faith in Him.

than "My words." What is the difference? Compare Deut.

teaching."

                             NOTES.
   I. "THREE times a year all the Jews were required to assemble
for religious purposes at Jerusalem. Jesus had not attended
several of these gatherings, because of the emnity of the Jews."
It was now time for the celebration of the Feast of Taber-
nacles. "But this feast was not solely a celebration of the in-
gathering, or a thanksgiving for the harvest. The name of it re-
minds us that another feature was quite as prominent. In its
original institution God commanded, 'Ye shall dwell in booths or
tabernacles seven days; all that are Israelites born shall dwell in
booths,' the reason being added, 'that your generations may
know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths when I
brought them out of the land of Egypt.' The particular signifi-
cance of the Israelites dwelling in booths seems to be that it
marked their deliverance from a life of bondage to a life of free-
dom; it reminded them how they had once no settled habitation,
but yet found a booth in the desert preferable to the well-provided
residences of Egypt. And every Feast of Tabernacles seemed in-
tended to recall these thoughts." "The sons of Joseph, who
passed as brothers of Jesus, were very much affected by this
desertion of so many of His disciples, and, as the time approached
for the Feast of Tabernacles, they urged Jesus to go up to Jeru-
salem, and, if He was indeed the Messiah, Ito present His claims
before the rulers and enforce His rights." "The lever they use

 to move is a taunt: 'If these works of yours are genuine miracles,
 don't hang about villages and country towns, but go and show

 has a claim on public attention wanders about in solitary places,
 but repairs to the most crowded haunts of men. Go up now to
 the feast, and your disciples will gather around you, and your
 claims will be settled once for all.' " "For not even His
 brothers were putting faith in Him." "Thus their very intimacy
 with Jesus, growing up with Him, as they did, from the beginning,
 in the same Nazareth home, not only had not predisposed them
 to belief in His Messiahship, but had probably prejudiced them
 unconsciously against such belief, the principle which prevailed
 with His fellow-townsmen (chapter 4 •44) operating yet more
powerfully with those of His own household." "At the following
 Passover He entered Jerusalem in the manner desired by His
brethren, and the result, as he foresaw, was His death."
   2. "AT the commencement of the Feast of Tabernacles, the ab-
sence of Jesus was commented upon. The Pharisees and rulers
anxiously looked for Him to come, hoping that they might have an
opportunity to condemn Him on account of something He might
say or do. They anxiously inquired, 'Where is He?' but no one
knew. Presently a dispute arose among the people in regard to
Jesus, many nobly defending Him as one sent of God, while
others bitterly accused Him as a deceiver of .the people. . .
In the midst of the feast, when the dispute concerning Himself
was at its height, Jesus walked calmly into the court of the temple,
and stood before the crowd as one possessed of unquestionable
authority. . . . They were astonished at His dignified and
courageous bearing in the midst of many powerful men' who were
thirsting for His life. Standing thus, with the eyes of all the
people riveted upon Him, He addressed them as no man had ever
done. His knowledge was greater than that of the learned priests
and elders, and He assumed an authority which they had never ven-
tured to take. . . . The hearts of the people thrilled with awe
as they listened to His divine words. His discourse showed that
He was well acquainted with the law in all its bearings, and was a
clear interpreter of the Scriptures. The question passes from one
to another, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?'

Some, less acquainted with His former life, inquire in what school
He has been instructed."
  3. " IF any man willeth to do His will " (R. V.). " Everything
depends on the right action of the will. The power of choice God
has given to men ; it is theirs to exercise. . . . This will, that
forms so important a factor in the character of man, was at the fall
given into the control of Satan ; and he has ever since been work-
ing in man to will and to do of his own pleasure, but to the utter
ruin and misery of man. But the infinite sacrifice of God in giving
Jesus, His beloved Son, to become a sacrifice for sin, enables Him
to say, without violating one principle of His government, Yield
yourself up to Me ; give Me that will ; take it from the control of
Satan, and I will take possession of it ; then I can work in you to
will and to do of My good pleasure.'"
  4. " IN these words (verse zo) they would insinuate that all the
wonderful works of Jesus were instigated by an evil spirit. They
also wish to direct the minds of the people from the words of
Jesus revealing their purpose of taking His life." " Such is the
climax of unbelief—death to the Christ of God! For this is its
essential meaning, even where the same literal deed is impossible."

                SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.
  I. WHEN the Jews sought to kill Jesus in Judea, He avoided that
country and walked in Galilee. What lesson may we learn with
reference to the question of persecution for the truth's sake?
  2. Why did not God by miraculous interposition save His own
Son from the murderous schemes of men? Why does He not save
His people from the persecutions of wicked rulers?
  3. " He deceiveth the people." Compare Rev. 12 : 9 ; I Tim.
2 : 14 ; 2 Thess 2 : 10. From the beginning of the first disaffection in
heaven it has been Satan's plan to charge upon others the very
things of which he is guilty himself. What blindness of mind
when the arch-deceiver himself can persuade men to charge
Christ, "The Faithful and True Witness," with being " that
deceiver" !

        LESSON VI.—November 7, 1896.
     QUESTIONS CONCERNING CHRIST AND HIS WORK.
                       (Chapter 7, verses 21-31.)

                            QUESTIONS.
     I. WHAT previous miracle did Jesus now mention?
    2. What rite had the Jews received from Moses? Was it first
known in the time of Moses?
   3. Did they regard the work of circumcising as a transgression
of the fourth commandment?
    4. What argument did Jesus build upon this well-known fact?
    5. What principle of judging did He command to them?
   6. What inquiry did the people make concerning Him?
    7. At what did they express their astonishment?
    8. What reason did they suggest for the course taken concern-
ing Christ?
   9. Did they really believe their own suggestion?
  10. How far did Jesus declare that their knowledge of Him
extended?
  it. With whom were they unacquainted?
  12. Was Jesus acquainted with Him? To what extent?
  13. What were they desirous of doing? Why did they not carry
their desire into execution?
  14. How did the people respond to His teaching?
  15. In what inquiry did they show their confidence in Him?
                               NOTES.
  I. IN speaking of the "one work" in verse 21 "Jesus referred to
His act of healing the man on the Sabbath (chapter 5 : 8, 9), and
showed that it was in accordance with Sabbath law. He alluded
also to the custom among the Jews of circumcising on the Sabbath.
If it was lawful to circumcise on the Sabbath, it must certainly be
right to relieve the afflicted."
   2. CIRCUMCISION did not originate with Moses. Gen. 17 : to ;
Roni. 4 : 11. In fact, both the moral and the ceremonial law were
given to Adam. " If man had kept the law of God, as given to

Adam after his fall, preserved by Noah, and observed by Abraham,
there would have been no necessity for the ordinance of circumci-
sion. And if the descendants of Abraham had kept the covenant,
of which circumcision was a sign, they would never have been
seduced into idolatry, nor would it have been necessary for them
to suffer a life of bondage in Egypt ; they would have kept God's
law in mind, and there would have been no necessity for it to be
proclaimed from Sinai, or engraved upon the tables of stone. And
had the people practiced the principles of the ten commandmentS,
there wonld have been no need of the additional precepts given to
Moses. The sacrificial system, committed to Adam, was also per-
verted by his descendants. Superstition, idolatry, cruelty, and
licentiousness corrupted the simple and significant service that
God had appointed. Through long intercourse with idolaters, the
people of Israel had mingled many heathen customs with their
worship ; therefore the Lord gave them at Sinai definite instruc-
tions concerning the sacrificial service." So, although it was re-
peated to Moses and by him given to the people, yet in reality it
was not " of Moses but of the fathers."
   2. THE boldness with which Jesus taught in the most public manner
astonished the people and induced the inquiry, " Have the rulers
come to know that this is the Christ indeed? " "Many of those
who lived at Jerusalem, and were not ignorant of the designs of the
Sanhedrin council against Jesus, were charmed with the doctrine
that He taught and with His pure and dignified bearing, and were
inclined to accept Him as the Son of God. They were not filled
with the bitter prejudice and hatred of the priests and rulers ; but
Satan was ready to suggest doubts and questions in their minds as
to the divinity of this man of humble origin. Many had received
the impression that the Messiah would have no natural relationship to
humanity, and it was not pleasant for them to think of Him whom
they hoped would be a mighty king of Israel, as one who sprung
from poverty and obscurity. . . . The minds of these men
were closed to the prophecies, which pointed out how and when
Christ was to come." "They thought they could account for
 Christ and trace Him to his origin ; and therefore they could not
 believe He was from God. This is the common difficulty. Men
 find it difficult to believe that one who was really born on earth,
                   FOR MISSION WORK IN INDIA.
22                     THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

and did not suddenly appear, nobody knew whence, can in any
peculiar sense be from God."
  3. " THEY claimed a knomledge. of what he origin of. Christ
should be, while they were in reality utterly ignorant of it, and
were locked in spiritual blindness. If they had lived in accord-
ance- with the will of the Father, they would have known His Son
when He was manifested to them. The words of Jesus convinced
many of those who listened ; but the rage of the rulers was
increased by this very fact, and they made an attempt to seize
Him."
  4. OBSERVE "the insufficient tests used both by the people and
the authorities for ascertaining whether Jesus was. or was not their
promised king. The tests they used were such as these: 'Will
Christ do more miracles? "Will He come from the same part of
the country?' and so forth. . . . In all His conversations with
the unbelieving Jews, He condemned them for their unbelief,
ascribed it to moral defects, and persistently maintained that it was
within the reach of any man to ascertain whether He was true or
a pretender."
                SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.
  I. WHAT was and is the true circumcision?
  2. Who were "the fathers "? and why so called?
  3. Study the evil consequences of resting our decision concern..
ing Christ upon a knowledge of Him which is merely human.
  4. How is the unity of purpose between Father and Son in the
plan of salvation shown in verse 29?

  23. With what argument did they answer him?
                               NOTES.
   I. "THE words of Jesus found a place in many hearts, and, like
seed sown in goodly soil, they afterward bore abundant harvests.
The spies scattered throughout the throng now report to the chief
priests and elders that Jesus is gaining great influence among the
people, and that many are already acknowledging their belief in
Him. The priests therefore secretly lay their plans to arrest Jesus;
but they arrange to take Him when He is alone; for they dare not
risk the effect upon the people of seizing Him while in their pres-
ence." Jesus understood their purposes, and replied to them in
verses 33, 34. "Soon the Saviour of the world will find a refuge
                   FOR MISSION WORK IN INDIA.
 74                     THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

  from the persecution of His enemies, where their scorn and hate
  will be powerless to harm Him. He will ascend to His Father, to
  be again the- Adored of atIgelg; and thither His murderers- can
  never come." Believers have no difficulty in finding Christ (Matt.
  7 : 7), and they will soon go to meet Him (t Thess. 4 : 17), but the
  world sees Him no more (John 14 : 19).
    2. "THE condition of the people made this appeal very forcible.
  They had been engaged in a continued scene of pomp and festiv-
 ity, their eyes had been dazzled with light and color, and their ears
  regaled with the richest music; but there had been nothing to
 meet the wants of the spirit, nothing to satisfy the thirst of the soul
 for that which perishes not. Jesus invited them to come and
 drink of the fountain of life, of that which should be in them a well
 of water springing up into everlasting life. . . . The words of
 the divine Teacher presented the gospel in a most impressive
 figure. . . . Jesus knew the wants of the human soul. . . .
 Many of those who heard Jesus were mourners over disappointed
 hopes, some were nourishing a secret grief, some were seeking to
 satisfy the restless longing of the soul with the things of this world
 and the praise of men; but when all this was gained, they found
 that they had toiled to reach only a broken cistern, from which
 they could not quench their fever thirst. . . . That sudden
 cry, 'If any man thirst,' startles them from their sorrowful medita-
 tion, and as they listen to the words that follow, their minds kindle
 with a new hope. . . . The cry of Christ to the thirsty soul is
 still going forth. It appeals to us with even greater power than to
•those who heard it in the temple on that last day of the feast. The
 weary and exhausted ones are offered the refreshing draught of
 eternal life. . . . All who come to Christ receive His love in
 their hearts, which is the water that springs up into everlasting
 life. Those who receive it impart it in turn to others, in good
 works, in right examples, in Christian counsel."
    3. "THE church has long been content with little of the blessing
 of God. They have not felt the need of reaching up to the exalted
 privileges purchased for them at infinite cost. Their spiritual
 strength has been feeble, their experience is of a dwarfed and crip-
 pled character, and they are disqualified for the work the Lord
 would have them do. They are not able to present the great and
 glorious truths of God's holy word, that would convict and convert
 souls through the agency of the Holy Spirit. The power of God
 awaits their demand and reception."
    4. THE people are believing on Jesus as the Christ, the officers

are softened by the power of His teaching, and Nicodemus speaks
in His behalf before the Sanhedrin. The Pharisees are furious,
but their rage is held in check. "They were startled and cha-
grined that one of their own number had been so impressed by the
power of Jesus as to openly defend Him in the council." "Note
their bitterness towards their servants, who had presumed to think
for themselves; towards the multitude, who were cursed; towards
Nicodemus." How characteristic it is of opposers of the truth to
resort to sarcasm and ridicule when arguments fail! Thus did the
Pharisees.

but the law requires a hearing before it judges. The Pharisees
are justifying both of the charges made against them by Jesus.

  24. Who did He say were the two witnesses required by the law?
                                 NOTES.
   I. THE Feast of Tabernacles is ended. For a week they have
lived in booths, "to commemorate the time when the Hebrews
dwelt in tents during their sojourn in the wilderness," but "the
last day, that great day of the feast," with its experiences, as
set forth in the last lesson, is gone, and "every man went unto his
own house;" but "Jesus went unto the Mount of Olives." They
had permanent dwellings to which they could return after their
brief and typical experience of camp life, but not so with Him.
Matt. 8 : 20. He seeks the solitude of the mountain as being
more in harmony with His feelings, and as offering the desired 'op-
portunity for communion with His Father. The shadow of the
cross is deepening, and the climax of His earthly career is nearing.
Feeling the need of that help rendered necessary by His human-
ity, He seeks it from the Father, just as we are hidden to do.

   2. THE story of the woman taken in sin "reveals in our Saviour's
character a wisdom so profound, a tenderness to sinners so deli-
cate, a hatred of sin so intense, an insight into human hearts so
searching, that it is impossible to suppose the mind of man could
have conceived, or the hand of man invented, this most pathetic
story."
   3. " JEsus well knew for what purpose this case had been
brought to Him ; He read the secrets of their hearts, and knew
the character and life history of every man in His presence. He
seemed indifferent to the question of the Pharisees, and, while
they were talking and pressing about Him; He stooped and wrote
carelessly with His finger in the sand. Although doing this with-
out apparent design, Jesus was tracing on the ground, in legible
characters, the particular sins of which the woman's accusers were
guilty, beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest. .
. . As their eyes fell upon the words written in the sand, fear
and surprise took possession of them. The people looking on
saw their countenances suddenly change, and pressed forward to
discover what they were regarding with such an expression of
astonishment and shame. Many of those who thus gathered
round also read the record of hidden sin inscribed against these
accusers of another. . . . There was not one of her accusers
but was more guilty than the conscience-stricken woman who
stood trembling with shame before Him."
   4. " JEsus did not palliate sin nor lessen the sense of crime ; but
He came not to condemn ; He came to lead the sinner to eternal
life. . . . Instead of to condemn the guilty, His work was to
reach into the very depths of human wo and degradation, lift up
the debased and sinful, and bid the trembling penitent to sin no
more."
   5. "IT is a terrible thing for a sinner to fall into the hands of his
fellow-sinners. Sin blinds them to their own faults, but sharpens
them to detect the faults of others. . . . Ah, how many there
are around us who had never come to what they are, had they not
been driven to it by the way in which the religious people around
them dealt with their first deviation from the paths of strict
integrity. . . . The world is full of sinners who are plunging

into deeper sin, because they have been taught by their more reli-
gious fellows_ that there is no hope for such as they are. But they
mightbe-savedifther could. only' be Treed from the religious world
and left alone with Jesus. . . . 0 souls conscious of sin, do not
wait to be brought into His holy presence ! Haste thither of your
own free-will. It is the only place in all the universe where you
will be safe. Accusing voices are hushed there, and accusing
forms are banished. Wait ! He will condemn thy sin but not
thee."
  6. " This was the beginning of a new life to this tempted, fallen
soul, a life of purity and peace, devoted to the service of God. In
raising this woman to a life of virtue, Jesus performed a greater
act than that of healing the most grievous bodily malady ; He
cured the sickness of the soul which is unto death everlasting.
This penitent woman became one of the firmest friends of Jesus."

                        QUESTIONS.

the Pharisees?

   8. How did He further explain the reason for that same state-
ment?
   9. What inquiry did this lead the Pharisees to make?
  10. Where did He tell them to look for an answer?
  it. What did He say of His future work among them?
  12. To whom did He refer as the source of all His instruction?

In what more specific way did He refer to the source of His
teaching?
  15. Whose presence did He say that He had?
  16. What made this experience possible to Him?
  17. What result followed from His teaching at this time?
                              NOTES.
  I. THE fact that the Jews did not recognize the character of God
in Christ (2 Cor. 5: 19) showed that they did not know God.
Christ was the "outshining" of God's glory (Heb. 1 :3), the arm
reaching down from heaven (Isa. 53 : 1), the means devised in
infinite wisdom and condescension to reveal God to men (Matt.
II : 27), and yet the very people to whom had been intrusted the
oracles of God (Rom. 3 : 2), foretelling all these things, rejected
Him (John t : ii).
   2. THE rejection of Christ by us here involves His rejection of
us in the heavenly courts (Luke 9 : 26), whither He went. Refus-
ing to follow Him here (Matt. 16% 24), we can not follow Him there
(Rev. 14: 4). It is important to notice that Christ says "can not"
rather than " will not." So He said to Nicodemus " can not see "
and " can not enter." There is only one way (John 14 : 6 ;
 Heb. To : 19, 20), and one name (Acts 4 : 12); and when these are
 refused, God " can not," in harmony with His divine plan, and in
                   FOR MISSION WORK IN INDIA.
30                      THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

view of man's freedom of choice, bring man into His presence.
" The goodness of God leadeth to repentance." But it is equally
true that by the mystery that attaches to our creation, man has it
in his power to frustrate this intention of God. The Holy Spirit
pleads with him, but he resists. He can resist. Were it not so,
he would be a mere machine. "Hearts can not be compelled;
they can only be drawn. Christ knocks at the door ; but we can,
if we choose, keep it bolted on the inside, and Christ will not
break the door down and force the way in." The choice which
we are making daily is fixing our choice for eternity. What choice
are we making? The personality of Christ is inseparable from His
teaching. He was what He taught. He not only spoke the truth,
but He was the truth ; He not only revealed the way, but was Him-
self the way. He not only instructed them about eternal life, but
He was "that eternal life." The Word was made flesh.
   3. How constantly Christ presents the Father to the people, and
Himself as merely the mouthpiece and representative of the
Father. "The only witness He cared for was that which the
Father bore to Him. Chapter 5 : 32 ; 8 : 18. The name in which He
came was the Father's. Chapter 5 : 43. He professed that all the at-
traction wrought by Him upon men was due to His Father's agency.
Chapter 6 : 44. He was sent by the Father ; He lived by the
Father ; He could do nothing of Himself ; the life He had was
given ; so also was the authority with which He executed judgment.
Chapter 5 : 26, 27 ; 6 : 57. He spoke only as the Father taught
Him. Chapter 8 : 28. He could dispense with all human help,
because the Father never left Him alone. Chapter 8 : i6, 29. To
honor Him, to please Him, to work His works, to live in His love,
to perform His commandments, to show good works from Him, to
glorify His name, to divert the attention of men to Him—such was
the passion of His life." We are to follow His example (Matt.
16 : 24 ; I Peter 2:21), but "service like this is a fruit which can only
be plucked from trees which have been planted and are tended by
the Spirit of God."
  4. THREE times in this gospel Christ speaks of Himself as one to
"be lifted up." The first was in His private talk with Nicodemus.
This is the second time He has spoken of it, but the first public
mention.

               SUGGES'T'IONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.
  I. WITH "His     hour" of verse zo compare "your hour" of Luke
22 : 53.
  2. The people who thought that possibly He might kill Him-
self, probably little thought that they would kill Him. Acts 3 : 15.
What wrought this change in their attitude toward Him?
  3. What is the difference between being "in the world" and
being "of the world"? Note carefully Christ's statements, I am
" from above," I am " not of this world."
  4. Christ says, " I judge no man" (verse 15), and, " I have
many things to . . . judge concerning you" (verse 26, R. V.).
Make the difference between these statements clear.
  5. The word rendered " lifted up," in chapters 3 : 14 ; 8: 28, and
12 :32, is rendered " exalted " in every other place in the New
Testament, with one exception only. What part did the crucifixion
have in the exaltation of Christ? Compare Phil. 2: 8, 9; James
4 : to, etc. The cross was the ladder to the throne.
   6. In what way is life only in Christ taught in this lesson?
   7. Christ was what He taught, and this gave power to His teach-
ing. What a lesson for all who would be teachers of the Word !

                             NOTES.
   I. "THE 'word' of which Jesus here speaks is His whole revela.
tion, all He taught by word and action, by His own habitual con-
duct, and by His miracles. This it is which gives knowledge of
        SABBATH SCHOOL CONTRIBUTIONS THIS QUARTER
                        'THE GOSPEL 131t JOHN.                          33
the truth. That is to say, all the truth which men require for living
they have in Christ." To continue ("abide," R. V.) in His word
is to abide in Christ (chapter 15 : 5), in the faith (Col. i : 23), in hope
(Rom. 12 : 12), in love (Eph. 3 : 17). To those who do this the
promise is, Ye shall know the truth."
    2. "WHEN the Lord Jesus reveals the truth of all that He has
 done for usthat in Him we are accepted and triumphant; that
 through Him we sit in heavenly places, with Satan beneath our
 feet; that from Him we are equipped with power to tread on
 serpents and scorpions, and all the power of the enemy—then the
 whole aspect of our life alters; we see our position, and we take it;
 we learn our power, and we use it; We realize that we are free, and
 as such we begin to act. . . . Acting by faith in the truth
 revealed to us, we discover that it is so."
    3. JOHN THE BAPTIST, in his preaching, had taught them to the
 contrary (Matt. 3 :9), yet the Jews were resting in their literal
 descent from Abraham. Christ emphasizes the fact that "not
 descent, but character, is the important thing." Rom. 9 : 8; Gal.
3 : 29.
    4. "HERE [verse 34] is one of the profoundest sentences
'ever spoken by our Lord. Men had not been wont to count
 themselves slaves. They were in the habit of thinking that they
 could take up sin, or lay it down, at their will, that they were its
 masters. Christ, however, has shown that it is not so, but that every
 time we yield to sin we increase its hold over us and become more
 deeply enthralled under its tyrannous power, so that we are com-
 pelled to obey its behests, however cruel or malignant they may
 be." "Every sinful indulgence strengthens the soul's aversion to
 God. The man who manifests an infidel hardihood, or a stolid
 indifference, to divine truth, is but reaping the harvest of that
 which he has himself sown. In all the Bible there is not a more
 fearful warning against trifling with evil than the words of the wise
 man, that the sinner 'shall be holden with the cords of his sins.'
  Prov. 5 : 22. Those who are "of the devil" (1 John 3 : 8) are
 slaves (2 Peter 2 : 19); but the service of Christ is freedom. "Jesus
 Christ came into the world to set men free, and to plant in their
 souls the genuine principle of liberty, liberty actuated by love,
                     FOR MISSION WORK IN INDIA.
34                    THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

. . . liberty in which man may be free from all men, yet made
so gentle by love that he would willingly become the servant of
ail, in order to bring-them to the enjoyment of this same liberty.
This is freedom indeed. This is the freedom which Christ gave
to man."
   5. How much is included in the promise, "Ye shall be free
in reality"? We are free from the imputation of Adam's sin, be-
cause He as the second Adam has borne it away; free from the
lash of a broken law, because He has paid the penalty, and met
its last demands. We are set free for service (Luke r : 74, 75), and
that the character of God as set forth in His law may be fulfilled in
us (Rom. 8 : 2-4) through Christ. Freedom from the curse of the
law (Gal. 3 :13) and the privilege of being "made the righteous-
ness of God in Him" (2 Cor. 5 :21), have been purchased for us.
"Oh, blessed announcement that God our Father has taken our
part against our sin, and, in the person of His Son, has come to
make us free, that we may be free indeed." "Christ is ready to
set us free from sin, but He does not force the will ; and if by per-
sistent transgression the will itself is wholly bent on evil, and we
do not desire to be set free, if we will not accept His grace, what
more can He do? We have destroyed ourselves by our deter-
mined rejection of His love."
    6. THE true children of Abraham "do the works of Abraham."
 By natureinherited from Adam being children of wrath (Eph. 2 :3)
 we need a new nature (2 Peter r : 4) in order that "we may work
 the works of God." "As Adam never could have brought us
 under the power of sin and death if he had not been our father,
 communicating to us his own nature, so Christ never could save
-us except by taking our nature upon Him, doing in that nature
 all that we would need to do, had it been possible for us to
 deliver ourselves, and then communicating the fruit of what He
 effected as a nature within us to be the power of a new, an eternal
 life. . . . So alone could He be the second Adam, the Father
 of a new race."
    7. JEsus "spoke the truth, but always in love. He denounced
 hypocrisy, unbelief, and iniquity, but tears were in His voice as He
 uttered His scathing rebukes.         . . These words (verse 44
         SABBATH SCHOOL CONTRIBUTIONS THIS QUARTER
                      THE GOSPEL By JOHN.                            35

were spoken with sorrowful pathos, as Jesus realized the terrible
condition into which these men had fallen." Speaking the truth
roused emnity against Himself, and so it will against His messen-
gers (Gal. 4 :16); but let every messenger be sure that he gives
no other cause for enmity than "speaking the truth in love."
   8. CHRIST was without sin in Himself, although sin was laid on
Him (Isa. 53 : 6), being found without fault at His trial. John
   : 38. No one could convince Him of sin (t John 3 : 4); for the law
which He fulfilled (Matt. 5 : 57) was in His heart (Ps. 4o : 8). He
is asking of many to-day, "Why do ye not believe Me?" Is there
any answer? See Matt. 22 : 12.
                SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.
   1.  HAD   these  Jews forgotten Egypt, Babylon, and the Roman
power? What was the cause of their subjection to other nations?
    2. Note that the personality of the devil, and the fact that he
has inspired others with his nature, are clearly taught here. See
  John 3 : so, etc.
   3. How many of the human family had Satan involved with
himself in the guilt of being murderers? See 1 John 3 : 15; Titus

their descent from Abraham?

                               NOTES.
  I. JESUS came   to be the bearer of eternal life to the world (John
6 :51), hut the very assertion of the purpose of His mission be-
came to the darkened minds of the Jews evidence that He was
possessed of "a demon." The Jews said, "Now we know that
Thou hast a devil," but their knowledge was not based upon faith,
and so was not fact, but rather falsehood. They were being taught
by a liar (chapter 8 : 44), and were believing a lie (2 Thess. 2: Ix);
         SABBATH SCHOOL CONTRIBUTIONS THIS QUARTER
                      THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.                         37
but those who are taught of God "may know" through faith that
Christ's words are true (t John 5 : 13, R. V.). As His words are life
(Johti 6 : 63) and He is the word, those who keep His words find
Him in them, and so find life (Prov. 8 : 35). What the Jews
were thinking of as death was changed into sleep by the work of
Christ for man. r Cor. 15 : 22. Death comes later to those who
have not laid hold on "the life which is life indeed." I Tim. 6 : 19,
R. V.
  2. "IF I glorify Myself, My glory is nothing; it is My Father
that glorifieth Me." Verse 54, R. V. Christ glorified not Him-
self (Heb. 5 : 5), but He desired glory that He might shed it back
again upon His Father," who gave it to Him.
  3. IN verse 58 Jesus makes the plainest declaration of His divin-
ity and preexistence. He declares Himself to be the I AM, as He
did later in the presence of the high priest. Mark 14:61, 62. "He
appropriated the incommunicable name of Jehovah."
   4. THE connection between the eighth and ninth chapters is
very close, and should not be broken. The Jews were rich and in-
creased with goods and had need of nothing, and so refused the
treasures offered to them in Christ. He was driven from them, and
so "passed by" them, but in doing so He found the blind beggar,
and gave him light.
   5. IN His reply to the question of the disciple, Jesus " did not
mean to suggest that there is no such thing as suffering for indi-
vidual or hereditary sin. . . . It was our Lord's intention to
warn the disciples against a curious and uncharitable scrutiny of
any man's life to find the cause of his misfortunes. We have to do
rather with the future than with the past, rather with the question
how we can help the man out of his difficulties, than with the
question how he got himself into them. . . . No matter what
has caused the suffering, here it certainly is always with us, and
what we have to do with it is to find in it material and opportunity
for a work of God. . . . We can cause men to feel that God
is thinking of them, and has sent help through us to them. . . .
If men can be induced to believe in the love of their fellow-men,
they are well on the road to belief in the love of God." " It is
true that sin brings suffering; but there is some suffering which is

38                     THE GOSPEL BY JOHN..

not the evidence of special wrongdoing. . . . Suffering is per-
mitted for wise and good reasons, which we shall one day compre-
hend, and among them is this: that it may provide a platform on
which the grace and power of God may manifest themselves, each
new phase of evil leading to some new forthputting of the heart
of God. . . . If there is need for the works of God to be mani-
fested, we must be-at hand, and willing at all costs to manifest
them. . . . The unique work of healing blindness and enriching
beggary is confined to earth, and we must hasten to do all of
this allotted to us before the nightfall."
  6. CHRIST, who was the Light of heaven, was sent into the world
that He might be "the Light of the world." So dense was the
darkness in which men were living, and so glorious was the light
which He came to manifest, that it was necessary to veil the light,
lest men should he destroyed by it. So He clothed His divinity
with humanity. If this Light is received and followed as the "Light
of life," our path will grow brighter (Prov. 4 : i8) until we shall be
able to endure the vision of His perfect glory (John 17 : 24) in the
world of light. As He is the light of this world, so He will be of
the heavenly city. Rev. 2 I : 23.
  7. "THE waters of Siloam by their very name ["Sent "] were a
perpetual reminder to the Jews of the water of life which God sent
to them in the desert land of their wanderings, and a parable of
the true water of life which He would send to them in the desert
land of this world's evil. How impressively, as he washed his
blindness away, must they have spoken to the blind man of the
healing mercy which had been sent to him by the stranger, with
the result that his spiritual vision was likewise restored!"

               SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.
  I. IN this lesson we have the plainest statements yet made of
Christ's divinity ("My Father . . . is your God"), and His
preexistence (" Before Abraham was i am "), and also the strong-
est outbreak of unbelief yet noted. The greater the light re-
jected, the greater the darkness. See Matt. 6 : 23.
  2. How did Abraham see Christ's day?

  3. What lesson is taught in the fact that Jesus used some out-
ward means in restoring sight to the blind?      '
  4. What added force is given to this miracle by the statement
that the man "was blind from his birth "?
  5. Compare this miracle with the one recorded in 2 Kings
5:9-14. Note the similarities and the differences.
  6. How is life only in Christ taught in this lesson?
  7. The combination "verily, verily," occurs repeatedly in this
gospel, but not once in either of the others. "Verily " is our word
"amen." In Isaiah 65:16 God is called "the God of Amen"
(R. V., margin). Compare 2 'Cor. 1:2o. What is the lesson
taught?

                 THE.11IRACLE DISCUSSED.
                       (Chapter 9, verses 13-25.)

   I. WHAT was done with the man who had received sight?
   2. On what day was the miracle performed?

   4. How did the man reply to them?
   5. What conclusion did some of the Pharisees draw?
   6. How did others view the matter?
   7. What was thus made manifest?
   8. How did they continue their questioning of the man?

 16. What caused this feeling on their part?

18. Who was now called again.?
19. What did the Jews declare their belief to be ooncerning the
One who had wrought the miracle?
20. Of what did the man admit his ignorance?
21. What did he know?

                              NOTES.
   I. IT may have been no special ill feeling which led the neigh
bors to bring to the Pharisees the man who had been healed of his
blindness, "hut as work had been done on the Sabbath, they
judge it best to refer the matter to these great authorities in mat-
ters of religion." The former inquiries are now repeated.
,`Again, therefore, he was asked, and (now) by the Pharisees, how
he had recovered his sight." The reply of the man caused a divi-
sion among his judges, and it is worth while to observe carefully
the conclusions arrived at, and the basis of their reasoning. The
one party say, This Man is not of God, because He keepeth not
the Sabbath day. Their course of reasoning is virtually this:
We have certain regulations in regard to the observance of the
Sabbath, and this Man has gone contrary to them. The fact that
a remarkable miracle of mercy has been performed by this Man
does not weigh in our minds against the other fact that He does
not keep the Sabbath, in harmony with our well-established rules.
This is really saying that God Himself must act in harmony with
their traditions if He wishes them to acknowledge Him as God.
They are exalting themselves above God. But this is only the
logical result of putting man's ideas in place of God's ideas, and
demanding submission to a man-made creed. We see the same
thing being done over again to-day. Then the chief question was
whether the Sabbath should be kept as God intended that it should
be kept, and so be a blessing to men, or whether it should be a bur-
den grievous to be borne because weighted down with the added
exactions of men. Now the question is whether the same day which
God blessed, and thus made a blessing to men, shall be observed,
or whether a rival day, upon which God has never placed a blessing,

shall be foisted into its place under ecclesiastical authority alone,
Christ Himself was condemned by the religious teachers of His day
as a Sabbath-breaker, and some of those who choose to follow
Him in the matter of Sabbath-keeping are being condemned in the
same way to-day. But, according to His own testimony, He kept
the commandments of God ( John 15 : to), and now through His
word He bears similar testimony (Rev. 14: 12) concerning those
who refuse to accept the traditions of men about the Sabbath.
    2. THE other party among the Pharisees yielded to the evidence,
 and agreed with Nicodemus (John 3: 2) that He exhibited divine
 credentials. It does not follow that they became believers on
'Christ, but in view of the nature of the miracle, they were not pre-
 pared to accept the logic of their traditions, lest haply they should
 be "found to fight even against God." They broke away from
 ecclesiastical bondage far enough to say, " How can a man that
 is a sinner do such miracles? " This may be a step toward belief
 on Him.
  3. " JEsus had been among this people, so marked with bigotry
and prejudice, and He knew that in healing on the Sabbath day
He would be regarded as a transgressor of the law. He Was aware
that the Pharisees would seize upon such acts with great indigna-
tion, and thereby seek to influence the people against Him. He
knew that they would use these works of mercy as strong argu-
ments to affect the minds of the masses, who had all their lives
been bound by the Jewish restrictions and exactions. Neverthe-
less, He was not prevented by this knowledge from breaking down
the senseless wall of superstition that barricaded the Sabbath, and
teaching men that charity and benevolence are lawful on all days."
   4. "IN all His lessons, Jesus presented to men the worthlessness
•of merely ceremonial obedience. He sought to impress them
 with the spirituality of the law, unveiling its vital principles, and
 making plain its eternal obligation. The righteousness of the law
 was presented to the world in the character of Christ, and the holy,
 benevolent, and paternal attributes of God were revealed in the
;Saviour's dealings with mankind."
   5. THE prophecy stated that Christ would be "numbered with
                    FOR MISSION WORK IN INDIA.
42                    THE GOSPEL. BY JOHN.

the transgressors" (Isa. 53 : 12), and so He was, during His ministry
(John 9:24),.and at His crucifixion (Mark 15 : 27, 28).
  6. THE Jews were not seeking for evidence that Jesus was the
Christ, for they had not only decided against Him themselves al-
ready, but had threatened with excommunication any who might
believe on Him. And this being put out of the synagogue was a
"punishment invplving the direst consequences socially and relig-
iously. It was, in fact, the lesser excommunication, which lasted
thirty days, but might be lengthened for continued impenitence,
or curtailed by contrition. It shut a person utterly from the syna-
gogue; for even if he entered it, he was reckoned as not present.
No mourning for the dead, and no right of circumcision, could take
place in his house, and no one but his wife or child could come
within four cubits of him."


               SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.
   I. JEsus made the clay and anointed his eyes; the man went
and washed. What lesson is taught in these facts?
   2. Every effort to hinder Christ's work only resulted in advanc-
ing it. 2 Cor. 13:8. The semi-official and critical examination
into this miracle only established its reality beyond a doubt. How
is the same principle illustrated in God's work to-day?
  3. God treated Christ as a sinner. Why? Men treated Christ
as a sinner? Why? What was the difference in their treatment
of Him?
  4. Some now accept the view of the Pharisees that Jesus broke
the Sabbath. Are they prepared to accept the conclusion that He
was "not of God "?
  5. Were not the Pharisees right in their logic? If a man wilfully
breaks the Sabbath, can he be "of God"? What is the present
application of this principle?
  6. Are miracles ever wrought through the instrumentality of
"a man that is a sinner "? Will the question be of any special
interest to this generation?

    LESSON XI11.—December 26, 1896.
SIGHT TO THOSE WHO - ARE BLIND; BLINDNESS TO
              THOSE WHO SEE.
                       (Chapter 9, verses 26-45.)

                            QUESTIONS.
   I. WHAT further   inquiries did the Jews make of the man born
blind?
    2. What reference did he make to their former discussion of
the matter?
    3. What inquiry did he make of them?
    4. What did they declare concerning him? What did they
claim for themselves?
    5. What did the man regard as a remarkable circumstance?
    6. What admitted truth did he state concerning a man's rela-
tion to God?
    7. Was the miracle which had been performed upon him an
ordinary one?
    8. What conclusion did he arrive at?
    9. In what way did they meet his convincing argument?
       What did they do to him?
   11. Who heard that they had cast him out? What did He ask
him?
   12. What response did the man make to this question?
   13. How did Jesus then declare Himself to him?
   14. How did the man receive this declaration?
   15. How did Jesus say that His coming into the world would
affect the blind? How would it affect those who had sight?
   16. Who were listening to this teaching?
   17. What did it lead them to ask?
   18. How did Jesus reply to their inquiry?

                              NOTES.
  I. IT is perfectly evident even to the man whose case is being
investigated that the Pharisees are not repeating their inquiries in
                   FOR MISSION WORK IN INDIA.
44                     THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

order to obtain more complete information. They are simply
quibbling. Their continued nagging stirs up the man to ask them
the question which above all others would exasperate them: "Are
ye, too, wishing to become His disciples? But they reviled him,
and said, Thou art a disciple of that One, but we are Moses' dis-
ciples." (Rotherham.) A disciple of that One, as if putting Him
far from them in disdain. A disciple is a learner, and uninten-
tionally the Pharisees were speaking in praise of the Man whom
they despised. They prided themselves upon being followers of
Moses, but their treatment of Jesus proved their claim a false one•
Chapter 5 : 46. They were right in thinking that God spake to
Moses (Ex. 33 : I), but it was God in His Son who spoke, and
not Moses. Although Moses was dead, yet God still lived, and
had they really known Him, they would have recognized that He
was speaking to them "in His Son." Heb. i : 2, R. V.
   2. How these Jews contradict themselves! A little while ago
they rejected Jesus because they felt too well acquainted with Him
(chapter 6 : 41,'42), but now they reject Him because they "know
not from whence He is." The logic of the beggar was better than
that of the Pharisees. He is not a theologian by profession, but
light seems to have come into his mind as well as into his eyes.
His experience illustrates a truth already taught to the Jews.
Chapter 7 : 17. "He does not know much, but he knows this
[How is it that they do not know it?] that such a miracle is an
answer to prayer, and that the prayer of the wicked is not
answered."
   3. THE case is no ordinary one. The miracle is a "notable"
one, and induces an irresistible conviction that the doer is "of
God." But this the Pharisees have decided beforehand not to
admit, and so no weight,of evidence can compel them to change
their view. Their very decision has shut out the light which
would enable them to reach a right conclusion. It is the light
from the sun shining into the eye which enables us to see the sun
itself, and if one deliberately closes his eyes, it is no wonder if he
does not see the sun. But there is still one course open to the
Pharisees, and, like a dishonest lawyer when the evidence is all
against him, they can abuse the witness, and this they proceed to
         SABBATH SCHOOL CONTRIBUTIONS THIS QUARTER
                      THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.                         45

do. They now admit what they had been inclined to deny, that
he had been born blind, by taunting him with it as a proof that he
was evidently a child of sin; and, with a self-sufficiency which they
seem to regard as enough to settle the whole question, they scorn-
fully inquire, "Dost thou teach us?"
   4. "THERE are men in such repute as leaders of opinion, and so
accustomed to teach rather than to learn, and to receive homage
rather than to give it, that scarcely any greater humiliation could
be required of them than to publicly profess themselves followers
of Christ." It was the application of this principle which prevented
the Pharisees from receiving instruction from the beggar. They
did not have power over his mind, and so could not cast the truth
out of it, as they gladly would have done if possible, but they did
have power over his connection with the outward forms of wor-
ship, "and they cast him out."
   5. "Bur Jesus heard of his punishment, and sought him out, and
declared to him more fully who He Himself was. He thus gave
to the man assurance of a friendship outweighing in value what ne
had lost. He made him feel that, though cut off from the fellow-
ship of the visible church, he was made a member of the true com-
monwealth of men—numbered among those who are united in
friendship, and in work, and in destiny, to Him who heads the
real work of God, and promotes the abiding interests of men.
And such is ever the reward of those who make sacrifices for
Christ, who lose employment or friends by too boldly confessing
their indebtedness to Him. They will themselves tell you that
Christ makes up to them for their losses by imparting clearer
knowledge of Himself, by making them conscious that they are
 remembered by Him, and by giving them a conscience void of
offense, and a spirit superior to worldly misfortunes."
   6. "THE blind man now saw, because he knew he was blind, and
 trusted that Christ could give him sight; the Pharisees were stone-
 blind to the world Christ opened to them and carried in His per-
son, because they thought that already they had all the knowledge
 they required. And wherever Christ comes, men thus form them-
 selves around Him in two groups, blind and seeing. Tor judg-
 ment,'—for testing and dividing men,—He is come. Nothing

goes more searchingly into a man's character than Christ's offer
to be to him the Light of life, to be his Leader to a perfect life.
This offer discloses what the man is content with, and what he
really sighs for."

              SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.
  I. WHAT kind of sinners does God refuse to hear? To what
kind does He lend a listening ear? Compare Ps. 66: 18; Dan-
9:3, 23.
  2. What connection did the Jews make in their teaching between
poverty, or physical blemish and suffering, and sin?
  3. What is taught in the statement that Jesus found him?
  4. What is the measure of responsibility in God's sight?
