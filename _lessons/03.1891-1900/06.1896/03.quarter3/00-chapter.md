      PROGRAM FOR FAMILY STUDY OF S. S. LESSONS,
    SABBATH.—(After church services or at the close of Sabbath.) Review
the lesson of the day by relating in detail the substance of the lesson, recall-
ing Scripture words and references. Read the lesson for the intermediate
division for next Sabbath from the Little Friend, and learn the memory verse.
    SUNDAY.—Study the first half of the lesson in the following manner.
    I. Assign a reference to each member of the family, using the lesson
pamphlet to ascertain what references are used in the lesson.
    2. Then read the texts in their regular order, carefully considering what
each' one says before reading the next one. Be sure to have each member
of the family understand the meaning of all the words in each text.
   3. Select two texts to be committed to memory through the day.
   4. Repeat the memory verse.                           -
    MONDAY.—Review the.portionofThe lesson already studied.
    i. Have each one name as .nfarry- references as he can.
  %2. Give each-Dne au opportunity to repeat the two texts that were to be
committed to memory on the previous day.
   3. Assign each one a text found in the first half of the lesson, and let one
member of the family ask the questions front the lesson pamphlet, and the
others in turn read the answers given in the texts or in the LESSON
QUARTERLY.
    Then study the last half of the lesson in the same manner that the first
half was studied on Sunday.
    TUESDAY.—Repeat the texts already committed to memory, and ask.
 he questions on the last half of the lesson, being sure that all understand
 he questions and the meaning of the words used in them.
    Select two texts to he committed to memory during the day.
    WEDNESDAY.—Repeat the texts already committed to memory, and
•eview the entire lesson by asking the questions in the LESSON QUARTERLY,
he As/rut/or, or the Little Friend, as may be thought best. .The number
and age of the children would usually indicate which lesson help would be
 he best.
    THURSDAY.—Read the• lesson notes in the QUARTERLY and those in the
i'abbath School Worker, and any other helps that may be accessible, and re-
uew the intermediate lesson in the Little Friend, or the one found in the

             GOSPEL BY JOHN

   FOR SENIOR CLASSES                    3d QUARTER, 1896


                  INTRODUCTORY NOTE.
   THE object of studying the Gospel of John is to learn what
the Holy Spirit has revealed in this particular book concerning
the person, work, and teaching of Jesus Christ. The true
method of studying the Gospels is first to study each one indepen-
dently of any other, in order to become familiar with the char-
acteristic teaching of each, after which they may be profitably
compared. For this reason the principal effort should be to
obtain a clear knowledge of each thought as presented by the
text of the lesson rather than to divert the mind to the develop-
ment of the thought in other places. There is no better way to
express the thoughts presented in the Scriptures than in the
very words of the Scriptures, and teachers are therefore urged
to require that the answers to the questions shall be given in the
exact words of the text. The effort of the student should be
directed to obtaining a complete mastery of each lesson, not by
attempting to commit the words to memory, but by so study-
ing the thoughts that they shall become a part of his mental
make-up; and he will then find that the easiest way to express
 the thoughts will be in the exact words of the text.
   There is constant danger of being diverted from the study of
 God's thought, as expressed to us in Ins word, to the study of
                                                       (3)
4                   TIKE. GOSPEL EV JOHN.

what some man has thought about God's thought. The very
object of Bible study is to be brought into direct communion
with the divine mind, that we may learn from God Himself what
He has condescended to reveal to us in language; but this object
is defeated when we allow another mind to interpose between
us and God's thought. The Scripture is God's thought incar-
nate, so to speak, put into human speech, in order that His mind
may be brought into direct contact with our minds, His thought
with our thought. But just as soon as we put man's thought
between us and God's thought, and try to let God's thought in
through some man's thought, we shut off our minds from a
direct contact with the divine mind. Thus the special blessing
of real Bible study is lost. The ideal Bible student is not the
one who can tell the most about the Bible, but the one who has
stored his mind with the precious thoughts of God, and is able
to expresS them readily in the very words in which God has
expressed them.
   This method of study makes it possible that "they shall be
all taught of God;" for it is when we consider what He says, as
He says it, that He can give us understanding, and the Holy
Spirit is appointed to this very work.
   Those who are skeptical as to this method of Bible study, are
urged to give it a fair trial in the study of this Book. Do not
consider any lesson properly prepared until any question which
will admit of being answered in the words of the text set apart
for the lesson, can be readily answered in the exact words of
the text without looking at the printed text. This can not be
accomplished by a hasty reading of the lesson a short time
before the Sabbath school. Make it a subject of much medita-
tion and the topic of conversation "when thou sittest in thine
house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest
down, and when thou risest up." Do not argue with any one
as to the meaning of any passage, but be sure that you know
exactly what God has said, and then seek the understanding
from Him who has promised wisdom to those who ask Him for
it. Those-who follow this plan faithfully will not only acquire a
mastery of what is revealed in the Book of John, but will also

gain an experience in study which will enable them to take up
any other Book in the same way for themselves, and thus to
become Bible students indeed.
  Use the notes and suggestions only as a means of studying
the text itself, and do not allow the mind to be diverted by
them from the study of the text. Otherwise they are a hin-
drance instead of a help.
  Teachers are urged to make a personal application of the
lessons both to themselves and to their classes. We are not to
study this book as a record of past events simply, but as living
and speaking to us now. We are to see revealed in it a living
Saviour, the Bearer of life and light and love to us; and as we
receive the truth as it is in Jesus, we are to experience its saving
power in our daily lives.
  After each chapter has been studied, encourage each mem-
ber of the class to express in few words the leading thoughts
of the chapter, and by frequent reviews fix these topics in mind.
If parents would do this for themselves, and then help their
children to do it, making it—instead of the gossip of the day—
a common subject of conversation in the homes, much good
might be accomplished. A genuine and lasting interest in
Bible study may thus be developed.



            LESSON 1.-July 4, 1896.
                     THE INTRODUCTION.
                        (Chapter x, verses x-18.)

                       QUESTIONS.
   I. WHAT was in the beginning?
   2. Where was the Word?
   3. What was the Word?
   4. When was the Word with God?
   5. How were all things made?

6                   THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

   6. What was in Him? What was it to men? Is it light to
you?
   7. Where does the light shine? With what result?
   8. What man was sent from God? For what purpose?
   9. What was the object of his witness-bearing?
  io. Was he that Light? What was his work?
  rt. What does the true Light do?
  12. Where was He? What was His relation to the world?
Did the world recognize Him?
  13. To what did He come? Was He received?
  14. What did He do for those who received Him?
  15. How were they born?       •
  16. What change was.experienced by the Word? Where did
He dwell?
  17. With what was He filled?
  18. What was thus made visible?
  19. What testimony did John bear concerning Him?
  20. What have we thus received?
  21. What did Moses give? What came by Jesus Christ?
  22. Has God Himself been seen?
  23. How has He been revealed?

                           NOTES.
    I. THE object of writing the Gospel is twofold: to furnish
ground for confidence that there was the incarnation of the
divine nature in the person of Christ (that Jesus is the Christ,
the Son of God, chapter zo : 31), and that this incarnation has
for its object to give eternal life to mankind (that believing ye
might have life through His name, lb.). Life in Christ only, and
life through Christ only, are leading thoughts in this Gospel,
and they are suggested in this introduction (of verses 4 and 12).
   2. THE true Light has an influence upon all men. "When-
ever they make an effort to reform, from a sincere desire to do
right, it is the power of Christ that is drawing them. . . •
The sinner may resist this love, may refuse to be drawn to
Christ; but if he does not resist, he will be drawn to Jesus."

Verse it is also, and properly, rendered, "Unto His own pos-
sessions He came, and His own people did not receive Him
home."—Rotherham. They who "receive Him" are they
"that believe on His name." To receive Him is to believe on
His name. It is ours to receive Him (Col. 2 : 6), and His to be-
stow the " power" ("right or privilege," margin). Christ took
our nature by birth (Gal. 4 : 4), that we might take His nature
(2 Peter I : 4) by birth (I Peter I : 23).
   3. " HE clothed His divinity with humanity, that He might
touch humanity; that His personal presence might be among
us; that we might know that He is acquainted with all our
trials, and sympathizes with our griefs; that every son and
daughter of Adam might understand that Jesus is the friend of
sinners. He set up His tabernacle (see Revised Version, margin
of verse 14) in the midst of our human encampment; He pitched
His tent by the side of the tents of men, that He might dwell
among us, and make us familiar with His divine character and
life." Thus was He true to His name, Immanuel. Matt. I :23.
   4. "DIVINITY needed humanity; for it required both the di-
vine and the human to bring salvation to the world. Divinity
needed humanity, that humanity might afford a channel of com-
munication between God and man. So with the servants and
messengers of Christ. Man needs a power outside of and be-
yond himself, to restore him to the likeness of God; but this
does not make the human agency unessential. Humanity lays
hold upon the divine power; Christ dwells in the heart by faith;
and through cooperation with the divine, the power of man be-
comes efficient for good."
   5. CHRIST was a visible manifestation to the world of the
glory of the Invisible One (Col. I : 15), and this thought runs
through this Gospel (chapters 2 : II; 7: 18; II : 4o; 17 : 22). The
fifteenth verse may be regarded as a parenthesis, and the last
clause may be rendered, " He who after me was coming, before
me has advanced; because He was my Chief."—Rotherham.
   6. GRACE appropriated becomes " a foundation for the be-
stowment of more grace;" or grace received becomes " a title
                  FOR MISSION WORK IN INDIA.
8                    THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

and claim to new grace." The law, which is the form of truth
(Rom. 2 : 20), was given by Moses, but the truth itself (that is,
the "reality" of the law in life) was in Christ (John 14 : 6)
Christ reveals God (Matt. ii : 27), not simply by words, but
also by His life. Thus "He declares the invisible God, acts as
His interpreter, gives expression to Him, renders Him cogniza-
ble to human faculties." Thus is He the Word. He is able to
reveal God fully, for "in the beginning was the Word, and the
Word was with God, and the Word was God."


          SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.
    I. COMPARE the first five verses in this lesson with the first
chapter of Genesis. Note the three steps in both places: "All
things" (inanimate creation), " life " (vegetable and animal
creation), "men" (man). Light and life by the Word of God
(the Word) in both records. Light in darkness (compare
2 Cor. 4 : 6).
   2. Observe the foundation for the whole question of condi-
tional immortality laid in verse 4.
   3. In the seventeenth verse may be found the true relation-
ship between the law and the Gospel, a formal, code becoming
life and reality in Christ.
   4. Note how fully this introduction to the Gospel presents
Christ. It teaches the preexistence of Christ (verse r), crea-
tion through Christ (verse 3), John's witness to Christ (verse 7),
the advent and rejection of Christ (verse II), the new birth to
become like Christ (verse 13), the incarnation of Christ (verse
14), and the representative character of Christ (verse 18).
Seven great facts. Each one might be studied for a day with
profit.
   5. Two great names are mentioned in this lesson: Moses, a
type of Christ, whose prayer was, "Show me now Thy way,"
and John the Baptist, whose mission it was to "make straight
the way." Both were "sent" to do a special work for God.

          LESSON 11.-July ii, 1896.
THE TESTIMONY OF JOHN THE BAPTIST TO CHRIST.
                     (Chapter I, verses .9-34.)

                        QUESTIONS.
   I. WHAT question was asked of John?
   2. Who asked it? Who sent the questioners?
   3. What reply did John make?
   4. With what specific questions did they urge their inquiry?
What reply did John make in each case?
   5. In order to have some answer to carry back to Jerusalem
what did they further ask?
   6. What did John then declare himself to be?
   7. To what sect did his questioners belong?
   8. What did they question his right to do? Why?
   9. With what did John say he baptized?
  ro. Whom did he say stood among them? Was His work
earlier or later than that of John?
    r. What estimate did John put upon his own unworthiness?
  12. Where did these things happen?
  13. Whom did John see the next day?
  14. Under what figure did he speak of Christ and His work?
  15. What testimony did he bear to His superiority?
  16. What does he now say was the purpose of his baptizing?
  17. What does he declare that he had seen?
  18. Of what had this been declared to be the sign? Who
told him?
  19. As a result of seeing this sign what record did he bear?

                            NOTES.
  I. JOHN'S work made a great stir (Mark 1 :4, 5), and a gen-
eral belief that it was time for the Messiah led to a spirit of
inquiry concerning this man of the wilderness (Luke 3 : 15).
                 FOR MISSION WORK IN INDIA.
IO                  tHE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

The excitement became so great that even the Sanhedrin
sent an official deputation to John, which asked him, " Who
art thou?" In the dialogue which follows John makes a
formal proclamation that the Messiah had come, and was
indeed present among them, but unknown by every one ex-
cept John himself. The literal basis of the figurative reply of
John may be found in "the practice of eastern monarchs, who,
whenever they entered upon an expedition or took a journey,
especially through desert countries, sent harbingers before them
to prepare all things for their passage, and pioneers to open the
passes, to level the ways, and to remove all impediments."
  2. "THE rabbis said, 'Every office which a servant will do for
his master a scholar should perform for his teacher, except loos-
ing his sandal thong.' But this exceptionally menial office the
Baptist declares he was not worthy to?erform for Jesus."
  3. SACRIFICIAL offerings of animals could not avail (Heb.I0:4),
but the death of Christ met every demand for all time (Heb.
9 :15) and for the whole world (t John 2 : 2). "When, under
the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, John had pointed to Jesus as
the Lamb of God, a new light was shed upon the Saviour's
mission."                                    • •
  4. " IN the throng gathered at the Jordan there were many
who had been present at the baptism of Jesus, but the sign then
given had been manifest to but few among them. Spiritual
things are spiritually discerned. Eyes that had never been
turned in faith to Him that is invisible, beheld not the revela-
tion of the glory of God, nor heard the voice from heaven.
So it is now. Often the presence of Christ and of the minister-
ing angels is manifest in the assemblies of the people, and yet
there are many who know it not. They discern nothing
unusual. But to some the Saviour's presence is revealed."

        SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.
  I. CAREFULLY observe the leading thoughts in the teaching of
John. The blood of the -Lamb, and the baptism of the Spirit,
were the two central truths of his creed and his preaching.

Jesus the Lamb taking away sin, Jesus the Anointed baptizing
with the Spirit.
  2. Three names are given in this lesson for Christ: The
Lamb of God, the Baptizer with the Holy Ghost, and the Son
of God.
  3. Note the new names introduced in this lesson : The Jews
(Pharisees), Elias, Isaiah, and Israel. The new places : Jeru-
salem, and Bethabara (or Bethany, see R. V.).
  4. Observe the humility of John in his estimate of Christ
(verses 15, 27, and 3o), and then read Christ's estimate of John
in Luke 7 : 28.
  5. Consider that the Spirit not only descended upon Christ,
but that it abode upon Him.



          LESSON I11.-July 18, 1896.
                  THE FIRST DISCIPLES.
                    (Chapter s, verses 35-51•)

                         QUESTIONS.
    I. WITH whom was John the next day?
    2. Whom did he see walking? What did he say of Him?
    3. What was the effect upon his two disciples?
    4. What did Jesus do? What did He say to them? What
inquiry did they make?
    5. What was His reply? How did they respond to His
invitation?
    6. What was the name of one of these first disciples?
    7. Whom did he at once seek for? What did he say to him?
What did he do with him?
    8. What did Jesus say to him?
    9. What happened the next day?
   10. Where did this fourth disciple live?
       Whom did Philip find? What testimony did Philip bear
to him?

12                  THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

  12. What was Nathanael's response? What was Philip's
reply?
  13. With what salutation did Jesus greet Nathanael?
  14. What question did Nathanael ask? What was the reply
of Jesus?
  15. To what confession of his faith did Nathanael then give
utterance?
  16. What inquiry did Jesus make in response? What assur-
ance did He then give him?
  17. What prophetic statement did He then make to him?

                            NOTES.
   I. THE work of John accomplished the right result,—his dis-
ciples heard him, but they followed Jesus. The great apostasy
was caused by men winning disciples to themselves. Acts 20:30.
   2. "IN the calling of John and Andrew and Simon, of Philip
and Nathanael, the foundation of the Christian church was laid.
John directed two of his disciples to Christ. Then one of these,
Andrew, finds his brother and brings him to the Saviour.
Philip is then called, and he goes in search of Nathanael.
These examples should teach us the importance of personal
effort, or of making direct appeals to kindred, friends, and
neighbors." The testimony which brought both Simon and
Nathanael to Jesus was, " We have found" Him. This is the
testimony which wins now.
  3. "AT the time when Philip called him, Nathanael had with-
drawn to a quiet grove to meditate upon the announcement of
John, and the prophecies concerning the Messiah. He prayed
that if the one announced by John was the deliverer, it might
be made known to him ; and the Holy Spirit rested upon him
with an overwhelming assurance that God had visited His peo-
ple, and raised up a horn of salvation for them. Philip's mes-
sage seemed to Nathanael a direct answer to his prayer."
  4. "LIKE Nathanael, we need to study God's word for our-
selves, and pray for the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit. He
who saw Nathanael under the fig tree, will see us in the secret

places of prayer, if we seek Him that we may know what is
truth. Angels from the world of light will be near to those who
in humility of heart pray for divine guidance." "The tree has
never grown which could conceal a soul from the eye of Jesus."

          SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.
  I. FOUR new titles for Christ are mentioned in this lesson :
Master (better, Teacher, R. V., margin), Messias, King of
Israel, Son of man. What different ideas of the work of
Christ are set forth in these titles !
  2. Jesus "looked upon" Peter twice. Verse 42, R. V., and
Luke 22 : 6t. The two looks may be considered with profit.
  3. What is the difference between Philip's confession of
Christ as "Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph," and Nathan-
ael's statement, "Thou art the Son of God "?
  4. Note the new names and the new places introduced in this
lesson.
   5. See how readily these men recognized Jesus as the Son of
God. Is not this the comment of Scripture upon the promise
in Matt. 5 : 8?

  I. IT was but natural that the mother of Jesus should be at
this gathering; for "the parties were relatives of Joseph and
Mary. The special object of Jesus in attending this marriage
feast was to commence the work of breaking down the exclu-
siveness which existed with the Jewish people, and to open the
way for their freer mingling with the people. He had come

not only as the Messiah of the Jews, but the Redeemer of the
world. By attending this feast, Jesus sanctioned marriage as a
divine institution, and through all His subsequent ministry, He
paid the marriage covenant a marked respect in illustrating
many important truths by it. While no shadow of worldly
levity marred His conduct, He had sanctioned the social gath-
ering with His presence. He gave no license to scenes of
dissipation and revelry, yet innocent happiness was pleasing to
Him."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 2, chapter 7.
  2. THE marriage relation was instituted before the fall (Gen.
2 : 18, 24), and, using it as an illustration of His union with His
church (Eph. 5 :23, 25, 29-32), Christ, through the word, has
taught precious lessons. It is a striking fact that the Sabbath
and marriage, the two institutions which were established dur-
ing man's innocency, are. now the special objects of Satan's
attack. Men are now declaring that both are a yoke of bond-
age, interfering with their liberty. True liberty is only found
in being in harmony with God (Ps. 119 : 45), and is not an
excuse for sin (I Peter 2 :16).
  3. THERE was no coldness or disrespect in Christ's form of
address to His mother. He used the same form of address in
His last words to her. Chapter 19 : 26.
  4. "Tuts donation of Christ to the marriage supper was a
symbol of the means of salvation. The water represented
baptism into His death; the wine, the shedding of His blood
for the purifying of the sins of the world. The provision made
for the wedding guests was ample, and not less abundant is the
provision for blotting out the iniquities of men. The wine
which Christ provided was not of an intoxicating character."—
Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 2, p. zai. "In the words, 'Destroy
this temple,' Christ gives a sign that He reads the secrets of
their souls. These words of Christ possessed a double mean-
ing, referring to the temple at Jerusalem as well as to His own
material body (the earthly temple of the Son of God). . . .
When the Jews should put Christ to death, they would virtually
destroy the temple. . . . As the death of Christ brought
                  FOR MISSION WORK IN INDIA,

to an end the sacrificial system, and destroyed the sacredness
of the earthly temple, so the resurrection of Christ involved the
opening of the true ministration in the sanctuary above, the
temple of God in heaven."

  15. Why is the Son of man lifted up?


                           NOTES.
  I. "THE mind is an invisible agent of God to produce.tangi-
ble results. Its influence is powerful, and governs the actions
of men. If purified from all evil, it is the motive power of
good. The regenerating Spirit of God, taking possession of
the mind, transforms the life; wicked thoughts are put away,
evil deeds are renounced, love, peace, and humility take the
place of anger, envy, and strife. That power which no human
eye can see, has created a new being in the image of God.
. . . The power of the Holy Spirit transforms the entire man.
This change constitutes the new birth. . . . Human nature
is vile, and man's character must be changed before it can
harmonize with the pure and holy in God's immortal kingdom.
This transformation is' the new birth." "Not even a re-
spectable life, and a respectable religiousness besides,—this
is not to be reborn; this is but to be mended, patched." There
must be "the communication of life by the Spirit of God."
   2. THE "must" of verse 7 finds its complement in the "must"
of verse 14. God "must" make provision for whatever "must''
be done in us.
   3. "You have resolved to give yourself to God. Now go to
 Him, and ask that He will wash away your sins, and give you a
new heart. Then believe that He does this, because He has
promised. Through this simple act of believing God, the Holy
 Spirit has begotten a new life in your heart. You are as a child
 born into the family of God, and He loves you as He loves His
 Son."—Steps to Christ, pp. Sr, sit.

 One may be "the teacher of Israel" (R. V.) and yet not know

        SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.
   I. NICODEMUS said, "We know," but Christ said, "I say unto
thee." What is the force of this change from the plural to the
singular?
  2. Two teachers are mentioned,—"a teacher come from God,"
and "the teacher of Israel" (R. V.). Note the difference be-
tween them.
   3. The "life" of chapter t :4 is now spoken of as "eternal
life." This is one of the key-words of this Gospel. We shall
have occasion to study it carefully.

  21. Of what is the believer on the Son in possession? What
awaits the unbeliever?

                           NOTES.
   I. THE first verse of this lesson contains the whole Gospel,
 —the love of God, the unspeakable gift (2 Cor. 9 : 15), as the
summary of God's work for the world; faith as the means
,of apprehending God's gift, and eternal life as the result,
 on man's part. He loved "the world," He loved "the
 church" (Eph. 5 : 25), He loved "me" (Gal. z: 20). "In order
 to save the sinner, the Creator sacrificed Himself. The Father
 suffered in His Son. The measure of God's love is Christ.
 The Saviour's sacrifice was not to create in God a love that had
 not before existed; it was but the expression of a love which
 had not been appreciated or understood." "0, what a God
 have we! What a Benefactor! What claims has He upon
 our love! Having collected all the riches of the universe, and
 laid open all the resources of infinite power, He gave all the
 heavenly treasure into the hands of Christ, and said: 'All these
 are for man. Use them to convince him that there is no love
 greater than Mine in earth or heaven. His greatest happiness
                  FOR MISSION WORK IN INDIA.
                     THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

consists in loving Me and giving his heart to Me, who hath loved
him with an infinite love.' " This verse completes the three-
fold purpose of God in giving His Son to the world,—that
He might be its Life (chapter i :4), its Light (chapter 1 : 9),
and its Love.
  2. CHRIST'S works were all wrought "in God" (chapter 14 : Jo,
II), that they might be wrought "in us" (Isa. 26 : 12) by His
power (Eph. 3 : 20), both in willing and in doing (Phil. 2 : 12, 13).
   3. THE present possession of eternal life through faith is the
lesson of verse 36. This life is in the Son (1 John 5 :       12),
and when we receive Christ by believing on Him (chapter I : 12),
it takes possession of us through the Spirit (Rom. 8: 2), to be
the power (Acts i : 8) that worketh in us mightily (Col. I :29).
This is not to say that we are immortal, or that we are made
immortal before the coming of Christ. That which we obtain
by faith we must hold by faith. Christ, who is the eternal life
(1 John 5: 2o, last clause), dwells in our hearts by faith (Eph.
3 : 17). "God is the fountain of life, and we can have life only
as we are in communion with Him. Separated from God,
existence may be ours for a little time, but we do not possess
life. . . . Only through the surrender of our will to God
is it possible for Him to impart His life to us. . . . It will
require a sacrifice to give yourself to God; but it is a sacrifice
of the lower for the higher, the earthly for the spiritual, the
perishable for the eternal."

         SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.

  2. How much is included in the experience of believing on
Christ?
  3. The word "sent" occurs over forty times in this Gospel as

      LESSON V11.—August 15, 1896.

                  THE WATER OF LIFE.

Jesus made aware?
    2. Who actually performed the rite of baptism?

  14. What is said of those who drank at the well?
  15. What is said of those who should drink of the living
water?
  16. What would the living water become?
  17. What request did the woman make which showed that
she still failed to understand Christ's words?

                               NOTES.
   i. How plainly the expression " being wearied with His jour-
ney " brings out the humanity of Christ! See Heb. 2 : 14, 17,
and 4 : 15. When Jesus needs food for Himself, He waits, al-
though " wearied," while His disciples go to buy it, but when
others "have nothing to eat," He has "compassion on the mul-
titude," and works a miracle to supply their needs. Nothing
for Himself (Rom. 15 : 3), but everything for others (Phil. 2 : 4).
   2. "THE Samaritans were of heathen origin" (2 Kings 17),
but " an adulterated Judaism was grafted on their native relig-
ion. They accepted the five Books of Moses, and looked for
a Messiah—as indeed they still do. The origin of their hatred
of the Jews is told in Ezra" (Ezra 4: 1-3). "They were.
treated as heathen, who had no part in the religion of Israel.
Hence the implacable religious enmity which for centuries man-
ifested itself in all sorts of petty annoyances, and, when occa-
sion offered, more serious injuries."
   3. IT is of the greatest importance to know the gift of God,
and to recognize the presence of Jesus to impart it. " If we
are not deriving from Christ what we recognize as living water,
it is because there is a defect in our knowledge, because we do
not know the gift of God." In speaking of living water Christ
" referred to the divine grace which He alone could bestow, and
which is as living water, purifying, refreshing, and invigorating
the soul."
   4. "JEsus did not intend to convey the idea that simply one
draught of the water of life would satisfy the receiver; he in
whom Christ abides has within himself the Fountain of life.
From this source he may draw strength and grace sufficient for

all his needs. Jesus will cheer the life and brighten the path of
all who will receive Him. From the heart in which Christ
dwells, flow out words and deeds of love that will carry a bless-
ing to other lives. The grace of Christ in the soul is like a
spring in the desert, welling up to refresh all, and making those
who are ready to perish eager to drink of the water of life."
        SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.
  I. NOTE the universal character of this lesson and the one in
the previous chapter, although each was given to a single indi-
vidual. What two classes are represented by Nicodemus and
the woman?
   2. Observe how an acquaintance with the facts of Old Testa-
ment history is taken for granted in the narratives of the New
Testament, and how the two are welded together. " The New
Testament is enfolded in the Old; and the Old Testament is un-
 folded in the New. For what is the law but the Gospel fore-
shadowed? and what is the Gospel but the law fulfilled?"
"There are in the New Testament nearly one Thousand direct
quotations from, and palpable allusions to, the Old Testament
scriptures."
   3. This is a lesson on gifts and giving. How many times is
this thought suggested? What contrast is brought out by the
word " buy " in verse 8?
   4. Study this lesson given by the great Teacher, as an illus-
tration of gentleness and tact in personal labor.
   5. Mark the contrasts in this lesson. Jesus "asks for a drink
of water; yet He offers to set flowing wells and fountains of wa-
ter. He is a suppliant for the gifts of another; yet He talks of
being able to give with unlimited munificence. He is an ob-
scure Stranger; yet He is greater than the venerable patriarch"
Jacob.
   6. See in the woman's question in verse 12 the great hin-
drance to the reception of new truth in all ages. Compare
chapter 7 : 48, etc.
   7. Compare the " living water" of this lesson with the "ever-
lasting life" of the last lesson.

  24. What part of the whole work did they do?
  25. What advantage did they enjoy?
                             NOTES.
   I. WHEN thus pressed with her own need of forgiveness and
cleansing, how much of human nature is shown in the effort to
turn the conversation. " Like this woman, we start some old
worn-out theological controversy, to put Him off the scent.
There are plenty of people who spend their lives in theological
disputes and refinements, because in this way they dexterously
manage to pass muster as religious people; though, all the while,
they dread anything like definite appeals to their hearts. " - "How
often the same course is pursued ! When the Holy Spirit is
impressing the heart, when God is seeking to awaken His
church to a new life, men turn aside, parrying the arrows of
conviction, neglecting that which concerns the salvation of the
soul, to dispute over some controverted point of doctrine."
   2. IN saying, "Ye worship that which ye know not " (R. V.),
"Jesus also alluded to the faith of the Samaritans being amal-
gamated with the worship of graven images. True, they held
that these idols were only to remind them of the living God,
the Ruler of the universe; but, nevertheless, the people were
 led to reverence these inanimate figures." This is the philoso-
 phy and the result of all idolatry.
   3. "THAT which Jesus had withheld from the Jews and en-
 joined upon His disciples to keep secret, was distinctly opened
 before the inquiring woman of Samaria; for He who knew all
 things perceived that she would make a right use of her knowl-
 edge, and be the means of leading others to the true faith."
 " Wherever there are hearts open to receive the truth, Christ
  has glad tidings for them. For such He uses no parables. He
 seeks not to disguise Himself. He says to them, as to the
  woman of Samaria, ' I that speak unto thee am He.'"
    4. THE disciples supposed that they had two good reasons
                  FOR MISSION WORK IN INDIA,
26                    THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

for marveling: first, because Jesus was talking with a Samari-
tan (Acts to : 28); second, because He was talking with "a
woman" (R. V.). "A rabbinical prejudice prevailed, to the
effect that woman is not capable of profound religious instruc-
tion." The woman's invitation is that of Christ to His first dis-
ciples (chapter r : 39), and of Philip to Nathanael (chapter r : 46).
  5. " THE disciples were good men, but they went into Sychar
judging the Samaritans good enough to trade with, but never
dreaming of telling them that the Messiah was outside their
town. They must have been ashamed to find how much more
capable an apostle the woman was than they."
  6. "THE disciples did not seem to appreciate the character of
the food which Jesus had to eat (verse 33) any better than the
woman understood concerning the living water (verse ii).
" It was not temporal food alone that sustained Him in His ar-
duous life; the accomplishment of the work which He left the
courts of heaven to perform strengthened Him for His labors,
and lifted Him above the necessities of humanity. To admin-
ister to a soul hungering and thirsting for the truth was more
satisfying to the Son of man than eating or drinking. Benevo-
lence was the life of His soul."

          SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.
  I. NOTE the new term by which Christ refers to God as "the
Father." What is the force of this title?
  2. What is the significance of using "we" in verse 22?
  3. The woman related her personal experience with Christ
as a means of drawing the people of the city to hear Him.
Compare this with Paul's method of defending himself before
Agrippa.
  4. Make a careful study of Jesus as one doing the will of God.
"Jesus Christ became man to bring us back to the blessedness
of doing God's will."

at the present time? What harvest is nearly ripe?

                              NOTES.
    I. WHEN the Saviour's presence is really desired, and He is
 " besought" to abide with us, He does so. See Luke 24: 29.
 The woman brought her neighbors and friends to Christ with
 the inquiry, " Is not this the Christ?" and after hearing Him
 for themselves, they "believed because of His own word," and
 their belief went beyond hers, just as Nathanael's belief went be-
 yond Philip's. "Before, they had looked upon Him as the
great Teacher, the Solver of problems, the Answerer of ques-
 tions. Now they see that he is the ' Saviour of the world.' "
 "Come into the very presence of Christ and hear Him for your-
selves. . . . Such spiritual contact is the life of the Chris-
 tian life."
    2. THE Samaritans believed, and then they knew. " Faith
 is simply the heart's reception of the words of Christ. Belief
of the truth is the knowledge of the truth."
   3. "THE father thought the presence of Christ was necessary.
. . . Jesus therefore demands a stronger faith; and in His
presence that stronger faith which can trust His word is devel-
oped. . . . The faith He approves and delights in is a faith
which does not require miracles as its foundation. . . .
There was that in Himself and in His talk which was its own
best evidence." See chapter 20 : 29.
   4. THE words of Christ to the ruler consist of a command ("Go
thy way"), and a statement of fact ("Thy son liveth"). The ruler
permitted the command to become true in him (he went his
way), and the servants met him with the testimony that the
statement had become true in his son, repeating the very words
of Jesus ("Thy son liveth"). By comparing notes they find that
the experience and the statement were synchronous.

  20. What additional charge did they now bring against Him?

                            NOTES.
  1. "JEsus did not ask this wretched sufferer to exercise faith
in Him. He simply inquired, Desirest thou to become whole?'
But, on hearing the voice of command, he believed Christ's
word, believed that he was made whole, and he made the effort
at once. He willed to walk, and he did walk. He acted on the
word of God, and God gave the power. Would that the same
simple, trusting faith were exercised by every soul in need of
spiritual healing. We are stricken, diseased through sin. By
transgression man has been severed from the life of God. His
soul is palsied. Only through the vivifying influence of the
grace of Christ is it possible for us to be restored. Many have
long been waiting and vainly striving to obtain by their own
efforts that spiritual life which will bring them into communion
and harmony with God, but in vain. They find themselves
weak in moral power, in slavery to doubt, and controlled by
the habits of their life of sin. 0 weary, struggling ones, look
up! The Saviour is bending over the purchase of His blood,
saying with inexpressible tenderness, pity, and love, ' Wilt thou
be made whole? ' If you believe Christ's promise, believe that
you do receive life from Him, and will to serve Him, you will
receive strength."
  2. CHRIST commanded the man to do three things : "Rise,"
"take," "walk." The power for rising was in the word
"rise ;" for taking, in the word "take;" for walking, in the word
"walk." Apply the principle in other scriptures: Isa. 6o: i ;
Matt. II :29 ; Col. 2 : 6. The fruit of the man's faith was seen
in what he did. He did it all by faith. He lived by faith
(Rom. i : 17), and he walked by faith (2 Cor. 5 : 8). The words

                     THE GOSPEL SY JOHN.

 accomplished what they commanded. The man "was made
  whole," "took," and "walked."
     3. THE whole controversy between Christ and the Jews
  gathered around three miracles, of which this is the first. The
  other two will be considered in the study of chapters 9 and
  11. A new element,—the question of what constitutes proper
  Sabbath-keeping,—is now introduced," Jesus had purposely
  chosen the Sabbath day upon which to perform the miracle
  at the pool. . . . A wise purpose underlay every act
  of Christ's life on earth; everything He did was important in
  itself and in its teaching. . . . The Sabbath, instead of
  being the blessing it was designed to be, had become a curse
  through the added requirements of the Jews. Jesus wished to
  rid it of these incumbrances, and leave it standing upon its own
  holy dignity. Therefore He chose the Sabbath for this special
  work. . . . This would raise the question of what it was
  lawful to do on the Sabbath day, and would give Him an
- opportunity to denounce the narrow prejudice and restrictions
  of the Jews in regard to the Lord's day, and declare their
  bigotry and traditions void. "—Spirit of Prophecy, pp. 161 ,162.1
     4. " JEsus sought to impress upon the narrow minds of the
  Jews a sense of the folly of their view of the Sabbath. He
  showed them that God's work never ceases. It is even greater
  upon the Sabbath than upon ordinary occasions; for at that
  time His people leave their usual employments and spend their
  time in prayerful meditation and worship. They ask more
  favors of Him upon the Sabbath than upon other days; they
  demand His special attention ; they crave His choicest bless-
  ings; they offer importunate prayers for special favors. God
  does not wait for the Sabbath to pass before He grants those
   requests, but He deals to the pe.itioners, with judicious wis-
  dom, whatever is best for them to have. Heaven's work never
   ceases for a moment, and men should never rest from doing
   good." It should be remembered that "the Son of man is Lord
   also of the Sabbath," and that what-He did on that day was in
   itself Sabbath-keeping.
      5. CHRIST was persecuted by the Jews, who would have put
                  FOR MISSION WORK IN INDIA.
32                  THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

Him to death at once if they could have had their way, because
He would not keep the. Sabbath according to their ideas of
Sabbath-keeping. Cain persisted in making an offering to God
according to his own mind, and slew Abel because he would
not join him in his way of worshiping God. The contest
always has been, and still is, between God's way and man's
way. Now a controversy about the Sabbath question has been
entered upon which will end only in the effort to put to death
those who will not yield to the demand to keep the Sabbath
according to man's command (Rev. 13 : is); but God will work
deliverance for His people. Read the whole Book of Esther
upon this subject, but especially chapters 3, 8, and 9.

           SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.
   I. WAS there any controversy between Christ and the Jews
at any time as to which day was the Sabbath?
   2. Bigotry does not hesitate to break one of the command-
ments in its efforts to sustain its interpretation of another.
  3. Notice the effect upon His work of Christ's first public
declaration of His equality with God.

the basis of His judgment? What kind of judgment is it?
Why?
   15. Did Jesus expect the Jews to receive His own unsupported
statements?
   16. Did He have any corroborative testimony? What kind
 was it?
   17. From whom had the Jews had testimony about Christ?
   18. Did such testimony strengthen Christ's faith? Why did
 He refer to it?
   19. Was it of temporary benefit to the Jews?
   20. What gave stronger evidence of Christ's divine mission?
   21. Who had borne personal testimony to the same effect?
   22. In what three particulars did the Jews lack knowledge of
 the Father?
    23. What proof is given that they did not know His word?
                           NOTES.
   I. THE statement in verse 19, repeated in verse 3o, brings
before us the position of entire dependence upon the Father
which Jesus voluntarily took, in order that He might be our ex-
ample, when He assumed our nature. " Christ came from
heaven to give to the world a correct representation of the
                  FOR MISSION WORK IN INDIA.
34                    THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

 Father. . . . The love and justice of God, and also the
 immutability of His law, are made manifest by the Saviour's
 life, no less than by His death. He assumed human nature,
 with its infirmities, its liabilities, its temptations. Matt. 8 : 17 ;
 Heb. 2 :17, 14. He exercised in His own behalf no power
 which we can not exercise. As man, He met temptation and
 overcame in the strength given Him of God. He gives us an
 example of perfect obedience. . . . His life testified that
 by the aid of the same divine power which Christ received, it is
possible for man to obey God's law."
    2. " FEW realize the full force of Christ's words in regard to
 His connection with the Father. They teach man that he
should consider himself inseparably bound to his heavenly
 Parent, that whatever position he may occupy, he is responsi-
 ble to God, who holds all destinies in His hands."
   3. THE leSson to Nicodemus, the lesson to the woman of
Samaria, the lesson in the healing of the nobleman's son, and
the impotent man, are all set forth in verse 21,—"life only in
Christ."
   4. "THEY were to behold greater wonders than the healing
of the poor sufferer at Bethesda. They would see the Son of
God restoring the dead to life, and this would be a testimony to
them of His power to restore to spiritual life those who were
dead in trespasses and sins. It was His work,through His teach-
ings, attended by the power of the Holy Spirit, to beget a new •
life in the souls of men, to make them partakers of the divine
nature. . . . This change is no less a miracle of the power
of God than is the raising of the dead to life."
   5. THE present possession of everlasting life through faith is
again taught in verse 24; see also verse 36 of chapter 3. By
comparing these two verses we shall see that believing on the
Son includes hearing His words (hearkening to them) and be-
lieving on the Father. " Faith is but the appropriation of the
lost life, offered to us again in Christ."
   6. GOD has life "in Himself," Christ has life "in Himself,"
but apart from God in Christ " ye have not life in yourselves "
(chapter 6 : 53, Revised Version).
   7. " HAVING tasted the very dregs of human affliction and
temptation, He is qualified to understand the frailties and sins
of men, and to pronounce judgment upon them. Therefore,
the Father has given this work into the hands of His Son, know-
ing that He who victoriously withstood the temptations of Satan,
in behalf of man, will be all-wise, just, and gracious in His deal-

ing with him. . . . And He who gave the light, He who
has followed the soul with tenderest love and entreaty, seeking
to win it from sin to holiness, He it is who is to be its final
judge."

         SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.
   I. THE thought that " the Son can do nothing of Himself"
is one of wondrous depth, and the whole subject will repay
careful study. In this is wrapped up the philosophy of the
temptations of Christ. He came to reveal the Father, but He was
tempted constantly to reveal Himself, to do something of Him-
self.
   2. What is the "death" and what is the " life " which are
contrasted in verse 24?
  3. Consider the true basis for being justified by works, as
shown in the life of Christ, and appealed to in verse 36.
   4. Observe the number of times that Christ mentions "the
Father" in this short talk with the Jews. What truth is He thus
emphasizing?
   5. The full force of the rebuke in verse 38 can only be appre-
ciated by a consideration of the way in which the Jews prided
themselves upon possessing the Scriptures, and their elaborate
study of their outward form. Compare Matt. 22 : 29.

    3. What connection did Christ declare that there was between

   9. Who is mentioned as their accuser?

      What followed as a consequence of this unbelief?

  13. Who followed Him? Why?
  14. To what place did He and His disciples go?
  15. What feast was soon to be held?
  16. In view of the place and the number, what natural inquiry
did Jesus make?
  17. What was the real intent of the inquiry?
  18. What reply was given to Him by Philip?
  19. What information did Andrew give? What question did
he ask?
  zo. What preliminary arrangements for a meal were made?
How many sat down?
  21. What did Jesus do with the small supply of provisions?
  22. After the meal was finished, what command did He give?
  23. What quantity of fragments remained?
  24. What effect did this miracle have upon those who saw it?


                            NOTES.
  i. His rejection by the Jews is still the theme of Christ's dis-
course with them, and He shows them that, although they pride
themselves upon their study of the Scriptures, through their
knowledge of which they expect to have salvation, yet they re-
ject that very word when it is made flesh, and are "not willing"
to come to Him who is the Life both of the Scriptures and the
believer. "The whole Bible tells of Christ. From the first
record of creation . . . to the closing promise, ' Behold, I
come quickly,' we are reading of His works and listening to His
voice. If you would become acquainted with the Saviour, study
the Holy Scriptures."
  2. "THE Scriptures are unfolded, not so much to the intellect,
as to the heart, of man. . . . The Bible is a sealed book,
so far as its spiritual treasures are concerned, to the man who
brings only his intellect to the study of it. . . . The intellect
is but the handmaid to the heart in Bible study. . • . The
Bible is a book addressed to the heart rather than to the head.
. . . Men generally do not understand the Bible, because they
seek to understand it with their heads, rather tha n with their

hearts. The word of God is to be heard with our ears Or seen
with our eyes, but it is to be understood with our hearts."
   3. "JESUS came by the authority of God, bearing His image,
fulfilling His word, and) seeking His glory; yet the leaders in Is-
rael did not recognize or accept Him; but when others should
come assuming the character of Christ, but actuated only by
their own will, seeking their own glory, they would be received.
And why? Because the teachings of these pretenders were in
harmony with the traditions and prejudices of the Jews. The
Jewish leaders were destitute of the love of Gbd; and while
their hearts were filled with envy, prejudice, and self-righteous-
ness, they could not distinguish the voice of God. They were
not acquainted with God. To them His voice through Jesus
Christ was the voice of a stranger. Does not the same danger
still exist? Are there not still those, it may be even religious
leaders, who, by indulging pride, self-righteousness, or prejudice,
are hardening their hearts against the influence of God's Holy
Spirit, and making it impossible for them to discern His voice?
It is thus that many reject the messages of truth that God sends
to them."
   4. IT is "a desert place" (Mark 6:32); but this is simply the
country as opposed to the city, an uninhabited place, and so
there was "much grass" there. Philip's liberal expenditure of
money would only provide " a little " for each one, but Christ s
blessing upon, and ministry of, Me little which they had, made
it possible for all to be " filled." A little of this world's goods,
with Christ, is better than all that the money of the world can
buy, without Christ.
   5. THE instruction in verse 12 is of general application.
" Every gift of God is to be made the most of. Fragments of
time, money, opportunity, influence, are not to be flung away,
but used."
   6. THIS lesson brings out the truth that Christ is the Sustainer
of spiritual life, as well as the Giver of it, and He would teach
that He sustains this life by imparting Himself. The full im-
port of this miracle is set forth by Christ Himself in his discourse
upon the bread of life, which will be studied in later lessons.

       SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.
  I. CHRIST said to the Jews, "Ye have not His word abiding in
you," and, "Ye have not the love of God in you." How are
the "word" and the "love" manifested in those who possess
them?
  2. GOd put His own name in Christ from the first (Heb. r :8;
                  FOR MISSION WORK IN INDIA.
38                   THE GOSPEL, BY JOHN.

Ex. 23 : 2 I; Isa. 9:6, etc.), and Christ "was manifested to take
away our sins" (i John 3 ; 5), by manifesting that name (John
17 :6) without which there is no salvation (Acts 4 : 12). That
name written in our foreheads (Rev. 14 ft) is a sign of the com-
pleted work. It is a fulfilment of the new covenant promise
(Heb. 8 : ro).
   3. Verse 44 brings out the lesson of "self-seeking a hin-
drance to faith."
   4. Were any delicacies, merely to please or to tempt the ap-
petite, provided in this meal?
   5. Compare the effect of this miracle upon the people with
its effect upon the rulers.
