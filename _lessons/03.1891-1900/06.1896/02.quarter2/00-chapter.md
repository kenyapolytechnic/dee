       PROGRAM FOR FAMILY STUDY OF S. S. LESSONS.
    SABBATH.—(After church services or at the close of Sabbath.) Review
the lesson of the day by relating in detail the substance of the lesson, recall-
ing Scripture words and references. Read the lesson for the intermediate-
division for next Sabbath from the Little Friend, and learn the memory verse.
    SUNDAY.—Study the first half of the lesson in the following manner:
    1. Assign a reference to each member of the family, using the lesson
pamphlet to ascertain what references are used in the lesson.
    2. Then read the texts in their regular order, carefully considering what
each one says before reading the next one. Be sure to have each member.
of the family understand the meaning of all the words in each text.
    3. Select two texts to be committed to memory through the day.
    4. Repeat the memory verse.
   MONDAY.—Review the portion of the lesson already studied.
    i. Have each one name as many references as he can.
    2. Give each one an opportunity to repeat the two texts that were to be
committed to memory on. the previous clay.
   3. Assign each one a text found in the first half of the lesson, and let one
member of the family ask the questions from the lesson pamphlet, and the

                        INTRODUCTION.
  THE subjects under consideration in these lessons can only be
briefly treated in one quarter. The aim has been to use only
leading texts that will guide the teacher and student in the in-
vestigation of these interesting subjects. It is left for the
teachers and students to study them as far as their time will
permit.
  Do not be afraid of wasting time in reviewing. Go over and
over each text until both the words and the thought of the text
are fastened in the mind.

                        LIFE IN CHRIST.                          5

  2. WHEN. God said, " Let there be light," then light was.
This illustrates the power there was in His word. It was not
power merely capable of action, but power in action. When
He commanded all things, they appeared. The same power
exists in His word at the present time.
  3. MAN, for his convenience in studying God's works in the
earth, has divided them into two great divisions, viz., inorganic
and organic. The organic is subdivided into vegetable and
animal kingdoms. The latter is sometimes spoken of as the
brute and human creation.
  4. THERE is one similarity in every created thing in organic
division. They all have life. This life came from the word of
God, and it is given to each created thing as it needs. If we
investigate the great family of the vegetable kingdom, we find
the same principle of life, only differently organized. When
we come to man, we find a higher state of organization. He is
endowed with some faculties we find in neither of the lower
creatures, yet his life is the same. God created all of them,
and organized each to fill a place in His creation. ife created
them all for His own pleasure.
  5. WHEN God spoke to the plants (Gen. I : I), His word im-
parted life to their seed. When the seed is planted, the life is
manifested in the tender shoot that comes forth, lifting or cleav-
ing the hard earth with which it is covered. This is a manifes-
tation of the power of Christ's words. Likewise, the word of
Christ is the source of the life of both man and animals. It
was the breath that caused both to exist, and sustains each in
his sphere. It is all one life, but organized in different ways.
In plant life there is growth, yet no power to think, while in
animals we see this life manifested so as to produce thought,
but not the higher developments which we see" in Man. This
shows- that life may exist without consciousness, as seen in
plants, and at times in the animals, but consciousness can not
exist without life.
  6. THERE is another life higher than that which we have been
considering, viz., the divine life. It is the Christ-life ( r John
5 : II, 12), given only to believers ( John 5 : 24), and is, a gift
through Jesus Christ (Rom. 6 : 23).

            MAN A HIGHER ORDER OF CREATION.

    I. What is said of the creation of man? Gen. i : 26.
 . 2. What is the signification of the expression "image of
God " ? Note 1.
    3. What is said of the moral condition of man when he was

                          trt: IN ctiuts-r

  13. What does the apostle Paul say of the first man? r Cor.
15 : 45, 47. Note 3„
                   THE LIFE GIVEN TO MAN.
  14. With what capacity was man created ? Note 4.
  r5. On what condition was an endless life promised him ?—
Bid.
  16. What was the essential thing to eternal life? Matt. 4: 4.
  17. Who is the source of that life? John 5 : 26.
  18. Who is our righteousness? r Cor. t : 3o.

                           NOTES.
   I. THE "image of God" signifies more than a physical
linage. It includes man's capacity for understanding God and
His works, also the power for ruling the dominion (Gen. I : 26-
31), and a condition for uprightness (Eccl. 7 : 29). God made
man in His likeness (Gen. 5 I i), in His image (Gen. 9: 6) and
glory (1 Cor. ri : 7).
  2. By sin, man came short of the glory of God, thus losing
his power to understand the things of God (1 Cor. 2 : 14), to
have dominion (Heb. 2 : 8), and the power to do right (Rom.
3 : 9-ii). In order for him to again occupy the position for
which he was created, he must be recreated (John 3 :3), with
the desire and power to live the life of God, and be restored to
the image of God (Col. 3 : to).
  3. ADAM, " the first man, became a living soul. . .           The
first man was of the dust from the earth." r Cor. 15:45, 47,
Syriac translation. "'Mere is a natural body, and there is a
spiritual body." 1 Cor. 15: 44. The Greek words may be liter-
ally rendered: "There is a soulical body, or soul body, and
there is a spirit body." "And so it is written, The first man
Adam -was made [became] a living soul." Verses 44, 45.
The first man, etc. (verse 47), i. c., the first man just declared a
living, or a live, soul (verse 45), "is of the earth earthy."
4. MAN was created with a capacity for an endless life, which
was assured to him on the condition of perfect obedience.
He was made a little lower than the angels (Ps. 8 : 4, 5), yet
he was crowned as the ruler of the earth. Verses 6-8. By
8                       LIFE IN CHRIST.

a law of his existence, righteousness is the essential thing to
endless existence. Matt. 4:4. Life in all its manifestations is
necessarily active. It can not be inert. In its nature, it is ever
the same, and different only in its manifestations. Eccl. 3:19.
All living persons or things have just such a portion of it as is
needful for their designed purpose or position. But the source
of all life is Christ, who is the Living One. He originates and
sustains life in all by giving it out of Himself. Acts 17: 25;
John 5:26.

    9. What occurs at man's death ?

  14. What can be said of time as related to those who are
asleep in death? Note 3.
                   THE POWER OF DEATH.
  15. What sentence was pronounced upon •Adapt in case he
transgressed ? Gen. 2 : 17.
  16. What power is there in death ? Note 4.
  17. What is death called? t Cor. 15 : 26.
   IS. Who has the power of death ? Heb. 2 : 14.
  19. For what purpose was Christ manifested? i John 3 :8.

                            NOTES.
  1. A MORE literal reading of r Cor. 15 : 18 would be, " They
which have fallen asleep in Christ have gone to nothing."
Paul follows the above with these words: "If in this life only
we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable."
In his reasoning, he regards the body of the first Adam as being
the man, and that without redemption man would certainly go
to nothing at death. As water, when the hydrogen and oxy-
gen are separated, ceases to be water, so, when the elements
that made man are separated, man ceases to exist.
   2. ONE of the marked characteristics of sleep is unconscious-
ness. An individual may feel a sense of drowsiness and yet
realize what is going on around him, but we do not say that he
is asleep until he is lost to all that is around him. Sight, smell,
hearing, and touch fail, and all voluntary motion ceases. This
is sleep, a profound unconsciousness. The Saviour, who knew
its nature full well, in the case of Lazarus used it to express
the condition of man in death. John tt :
 10                      LIFE IN CHRIST.

     3. IN unconsciousness there is no account of time. This has
  been illustrated many times in case of accident. Persons re-
  ceiving a stroke upon the head have been unconscious for sev-
  eral days. If they have received the blow while speaking, the
  sentence is broken off till consciousness is restored, when they
  finish the sentence, having no knowledge of the intervening
  time. - So in death, there may be a long time from death to the
  resurrection, but to the dead it is nothing. One moment it is
  losing consciousness, while the next it is awakened by the voice
' of Jesus Christ.
   4. SATAN is the author of sin (1 John 3 : S), and death came by
 sin (Rom. 5 : 12); therefore all the power of Satan is in death.
 Sin is disorganizing and destructive, not merely of happiness,
 but of life itself. 7anles i : 14, 15.

  18. What must take place before there can be a second death ?
—Ibid.
                              NOTES.
   I. CHRIST was not only born a- man, but He was born under
the law, both to be judged by the law, and to be dealt with
according to the law in His own person; and as man's represent- •
ative, to satisfy the law for all of man's transgressions of it.
  2. ROTHERHAM'S translation reads, "Who, in God's form
subsisting, not a thing to be seized on, esteemed the being equal
with God; but emptied Himself, taking a servant's form, com-
ing to be in men's likeness; and, in fashion being found as a
12                     LIFE IN CHRIST.

man, humbled Himself, becoming obedient as far as death, yea,
death on a cross." In order to meet man where he was after
the fall, Christ emptied Himself of all His glory and power,
becoming just as dependent on the Father for life and daily
strength as sinful man is dependent upon Him.
  3. THE gospel and epistles of John are full of statements that
Christ came to give life. " In Him was life." . John ,j :4-
"Whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have ever-
lasting life." John 3 : 16. " He that heareth . My word, and
believeth on Him that sent Me,hath everlasting              John
5 : 24. Over and over again He reiterates the statement in every
possible form that His work on earth is to give everlasting life,
to prevent men from dying, from perishing, from coming to
nothing. See John 6 : 50, 54, 57, 58; i Cor. T5 : 17, 18.
  4. THE teachings of Christ throughout show that the very
object of the incarnation is to immortalize mankind; that man
can not live forever only by a complete union with the Incarnate
Word; that, apart from such union, man will die, perish, and be
destroyed.
  5. THE work of Christ in redemption is, in the Scriptures,
interwoven with the history of the sin of man in Paradise. The
doctrine of the first and second Adam constitutes the mystery of
the Gospel. i Corinthians 15. Christ, in His teachings, makes
clear references to the history of the fall of man as the basis of
God's dealings with the human race. He speaks of Satan as a
murderer from the beginning (John 8 : 44), and of Himself, as
sent to destroy the -devil and his works. But a murderer is a
destroyer of life. By giving a history of the first Adam at cre-
ation, Christ forever fixes the meaning of death, and the gift of
eternal life. Christ appeared " to abolish death," and the death
which He abolished was the death that came into the world by
the original sin (Rom. 5 : 12), and through the temptation of the
original murderer. Death is the absence of life. There could
be no such thing as a second death unless the death pronounced

of all. This makes death but a sleep, with the assurance of
awakening in the morning.

                               NOTES.
     I. THE sentence of death spoken of in Rom. 6: 23 and Eze.
  18 : 4 can have no reference to the original sin, for Christ has
  f-eed all from that death, whether righteous or wicked. 1 Cor.
  15 : 22. • In promising a resurrection to all, and in making it sure
  by His own death and resurrection, He has abolished that
' death for all alike.
   2. " IS condemned already." He is under the death sentence.
 This is the second death, from which there is no release outside
 of Christ. It is not for the sins of another, but for the sins of
 him who transgresses. As all have transgressed, so all are, or
 have been, under the death sentence.
   3. THE Lord is righteous, therefore when the sinner becomes
 righteous, he becomes like God, or godly. In this sinful con-
 dition he is at enemity with God and His law (Rom. 8 : 7); but
 by imputed righteousness he becomes changed s6 that he is in
 harmony with God.        •
    4. THE life of man can not gain the victory over death, since
 the very source of man's life is poisoned with death. His life
 is but a living death. He can no more work _himself up to be
 a partaker of the divine nature than a beast can work itself up
 into humanity. Therefore salvation, in the sense of being
 saved alive from eternal death, must be alone the gift of God.
   5. As the wages of sin is death, so the gift of righteousness
 is life. Therefore man can have no hope for life in himself, for
 he can get no righteciusness from himself. Through the death

of Christ we arc not only saved from wrath, but we.are- reek-,
oned righteous on believing, because Christ's righteousness is
imputed to us. This means that we are now regarded by God'
as being one with Christ in righteousness, and therefore as
standing before Him as uncondemned. This is a great mystery,
which the learned Nicodemus could not fully comprehend (John
3 : 3-5), yet it is as true to-day as then. Paul clearly teaches
that we are constituted sinners by the disobedience of Adam.
Rom. 5 : 12. Here is the first. imputation, that of Adam's sin
to the whole race, who sinned in him and died in him. Now
follow the parallel in Christ. He bore " our sins in His own
body on the tree." "He hath made Him to be sin for us, who
knew no sin." This is the second act of imputation. Then
follows the third act of imputation, in that Christ was made
"our righteousness," so that "we might be made the righteous-
ness of God in Him." See 2 Cor. 5 : 21; i Peter 2 : 24.
  6. WHEN an individual is born again, he is a " new creature"
(2 Cor. 5 : 17), because he is reckoned as one with Christ. Old.
things (sin) have passed away, and he has a new life. This life
is Christ's life lived in him. He is no more under the con-
demnation of God's law, for he has accepted Christ's death.
which frees him from death. He has passed from death unto life.

  17. What promises are made to those that continue in well-
doing? Rom. 2: 7.

                           NOTES.
   I. WHILE man is the highest of all earthly creatures, and
much superior to the brutes of the highest rank, the distinction
between him and them is not an infinite one. He was formed
out of the same dust (Gen. 2 : 7) as they, though more exquis-
itely fashioned. He was quickened by the same breath of
God. See Gen. 2 : 7; 7 : 22. He was made subject to the
same physical laws.
  2. MAN represents the highest order of living creatures on
earth. Yet the difference•in degree is not so great as to take
                        LICE IN CHRIST.

man out of the list of mortal creatures, and secure him against
the common lot of all material and organic life.
   3. THE life received by the believer is eternal because it is
the life of Christ. See Rev. I : 18. For the same reason it is
divine and holy. No life can be eternally perpetuated but that
which is pure, and in perfect harmony with the great Source of
all life. The great object and end of man's redemption through
Christ was to generate within man this new, divine life, and so
make him holy and free from condemnation. The expressions,
"eternal life," -"everlasting life," which are so often used in the
Scriptures to designate that divine life which the Spirit breathes
into -man in his new creation, mean more than purity. They
mean that, but they also mean the life of God. r John 5 : 12.
  4. THE change' wrought in the believer at the second coming
of Christ is not a moral change. He must pass the judgment
of investigation before the trump sounds. He must have the
garment of righteousness before this change takes place. He
must have had Christ enthroned within before his name passes
in to judgment. But to have Christ within is to have eternal
life, for "he that hath the Son hath life." The change from
mortality to immortality which takes place at the second com-
ing. of Christ is a physical change. It is the releasing of the
physical nature from the effects of Adam's sin according to the
promise of God. When the time is fulfilled for this promise to
take effect, the bond of death is broken and the prisoners are
free. To them, no time has elapsed since they fell asleep; so
there was no real break in their lives. They come forth, say-
ing: " Death is swallowed up in victory. 0 death, where is
thy sting? 0 grave, where is thy victory?"

           THE RESURRECTION OF THE UNGODLY.

  17. How long after the resurrection of the righteous will it be

  18. How many classes will be raised? Acts 24: 15.
  19. To what are the wicked to come forth? John 5 : 29.
  20. Do they have eternal life? Rev. 20 : 8, 9.

                           NOTES.
   I. THE word " resurrection " is defined as follows: "A rising
again from the dead: a return from death to life."— The Stand-
ard. The Greek word anastasis is defined as "a standing up,
rising up, as from the dead."—Bnainger.
  2. THE expressions, " first fruits," " firstborn," and " first
begotten," when applied to Christ, must denote the preemi-
nent rank and station which" He holds in the great work of
redemption, rather than in the order of time in which His res-
urrection occurred. We read of several resurrected ones who
were raised before Christ was raised. See i Kings 17; 2 Kings
4; Luke 7 : 14; 8 : 4o, 55; John i> :11-26. It would be doing
violence to the scriptures to attempt to dispose of these by say-
ing they were raised to mortality only, for all the wicked are
thus raised, and spoken of as being resurrected. See John
5: 29; Acts 24: 15. All these resurrections center in Christ,
who is the resurrection and the life. He stands out foremost
and preeminent in all these instances, whether occurring before
or after His resurrection. In this sense He is the "first fruits"
of those that slept. He is the chief one, for the raising of all
the others depended upon His power.
  3. THE transfiguration (Matt. 17 : 1-5) was a miniature repre-
sentation of the coming of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
See chapter 16 : 28. Here Christ appeared in kingly majesty
(2 Peter i : i6, 17), and Elijah as a representative of those that
shall be changed in a moment without seeing death, and Moses,
who had died, but was resurrected. See _Jude 9. Christ's
kingdom is to be in connection with His coming (2 Tim. 4 : t),
and that is the time when all the righteous dead are raised, and
the living righteous will be changed. It is the same power that
15.o                   LIFE IN CHRIST.

gives immortality to the living that raises the dead. So it is
giving immortality to both the living and the dead who have
had the abiding Christ within.

  26. Then what shall return to those who have believed the

                            NOTES.
  r. IT is an erroneous idea that because God pronounces the
death sentence upon the ungodly, He must hate them. In say-
ing that the soul that sinneth it shall die, He only shows what
the sinner chooses. Sin must be destroyed. Its author, the
devil, and its subjects, those who choose that way, must go
with it. God's' ong-suffering has been manifested for nearly
six thousand years, so that all might come to Him and live.
He sacrificed the choicest gift of heaven to save all that- have
sinned. •I John 2 : 2. His wrath is not against the sinner, but
against the sin. He has provided a way in which He can par-
22                     LIFE IN CHRIST.


don the vilest sinner, but sin He never can pardon. Man is
given his choice, whether he will forsake sin and have life, or
cling to that which God hates, and thus be an enemy of God
and meet the fate He has pronounced against sin.
   2.- THERE is no scripture that locates the wicked in any other
place than this earth. They have sinned on this earth, and they
die the first death on this earth; they are resurrected here, and
they are punished where they have sinned. Rev. 20 : S, 9.
   3. To destroy is "to abolish; put an end to the existence of;
to cause to cease; cut off; kill." The Greek word from which
our English word ".destroy" comes is defined, "to perish; to
come to an end." A thing that is destroyed does licit exist
any longer. Its component elements may still exist in sonic
other form, but the thing itself has perished. Wien a house
is destroyed by fire, as a house it no longer exists. There may
be ashes, heat, smoke, nails, etc., in existence, but they can
no longer be called a house, for it has perished.
   4. ALL through the Bible very combustible matter is used to
represent the wicked when their destruction is mentioned.
They are likened to chaff (Matt. 3: 22); to tares (Matt. 23:40);
withered branches (John i5 : 6); fat of lambs (Ps. 37 : 20); and
to thorns (Isa.    12), all of which are soon consumed by fire.
   5. TVEY are said to "be burned up, root and branch." In
Mark 9 :4J, 44 a figure is borrowed from the Old Testament to
illustrate the complete destruction of the wicked. In the val-
ley of Hinnom, near Jerusalem, was a place where all the refuse
and the dead carcasses of animals were deposited. Here a fire
was kept burning night and day to consume the refuse matter.
Where some part of the carcass was near the edge of the fire
so that it was not consumed, the worm completed the destruc-
tion until it was utterly consumed. The Saviour quoted from
this to show that the wicked would be utterly destroyed and
nothing left.
   Again, the term "forever"is used in connection with the
punishment of the ungodly. Rev. 20 : 10. This term expresses
just what it will be for those who obey not the gospel, for their
destruction will never be reversed. The second death is a
death that has no promise of a life beyond, so it is eternal,
ever/ash* forczvr,

  I. "WHEN He [God] came to crown His glorious work, to
place one in the *midst to stand as ruler of the fair earth, He did
not fail to create a being worthy of the hand that gave him life.
. . . - He was placed, as God's representative, over the lower
orders of beings. They can not understand or acknowledge
the sovereignty of God, yet they were made capable of loving
and serving'man."—Palriarchs and Prophets, p. ¢S.
  2. "WHILE they remained true to God, Adam and his com-
panion were to-bear rule over the earth. Unlimited control
was given them over every living thing. The lion and the
lamb sported peacefully around them, or lay down together at
their feet. The happy birds flitted about them without fear; and
as their songs ascended to the praise of their Creator, Adam
and Eve united With them in thanksgiving to the Father and
the Son."— Patriarchs and Prophets, p so.
   3. "IN order to possess an endless existence, man must con-
tinue to partake of the tree of life. Deprived of this, his vitality
would gradually diminish till life would become extinct. . . ,
But after man's fall, holy angels were immediately commis-
sioned to guard the tree of life            None of the family of
Adam were permitted to pass that barrier to partake of the
life-giving fruit; hence there is not an immortal sinner."—Patri-

                            NOTE.
  " THE ritual of the covenant itself is that which was fre-
quently applied among most of the ancient nations, the Greeks
and Romans, the Chaldeans and Macedonians. The sacrificial
animal was divided into two halves, between which the contract-
ing parties passed, thereby intimating that they would deserve
to be so killed if they ventured to violate the agreement. -But
as, in fact, the act here described was not strictly a covenant,
but a sign or promise on the part of God, only given under the
form of a covenant, God only passed through the dissected
parts in the shape of clouds, smoke, and fire; Abraham was a
passive spectator, and the very beginning of the ceremony
points to this feature; for God commanded Abraham, 'Take for
Me a heifer,' etc. Wherever a real covenant was intended, it
was customary among the Hebrews also that both parties should
go between the divided animal. Jer. 34 : 18, 19. And on one
particularly solemn occasion, when a perpetual alliance between
God and Israel was ratified, the blood of the sacrifices was
 partly sprinkled on the altar, which represents God, and partly
 upon the people. Ex. 24 :
   "A young heifer, a she goat, and a ram, each of three years
 old, were wont to be divided in the ceremony of human engage-
 ments between contracting parties, and the pieces set far enough

apart to let these pass between them, as if to call down' on
themselves the fate of the victims, if they broke the covenant
thus ratified."—Geikie' s Hours with the Bible, vol. 1,p.

                           NOTES.
  1. BISHOP HORSLEY translates 2 Sam. 7: 19 as follows: "
Lord God. Thou hast spoken of Thy servant's house for a
great while to come, and hast regarded me in the arrangements
about the Man that is to be from above, 0 God Jehovah," or,
as some translate, "The Adam from above, God Jehovah."
  2. THE name " David," as used in these scriptures, evidently
alludes to Christ;. for David had been dead for centuries when
these promises were made. On the clay of PenteCost, Peter
says of David: " He is both dead and buried, and his sepulcher
is with us unto this day. Therefore being a prophet, and
knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of
the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, He would raise up
Christ to sit on his throne." Acts 2: 29, 3o. This shows that
where a future reign of David is promised in prophecy, it refers
to the reign of Christ on the throne of His father David. See
Ps. 89 : 29-21, 27-29; 132 :    12; Luke -1 : 32, 33.
