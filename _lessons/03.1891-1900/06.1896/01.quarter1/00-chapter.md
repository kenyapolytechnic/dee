          REVEItATION FOURTEEN

 FOR SENIOR CLASSES                   FIRST QUARTER, 1896


                        INTRODUCTORY.
    OUR last quarter's lessons were upon the important subject
of Religious Liberty. This quarter's lessons are, in a large
sense, a continuation of that subject, beginning where the last
quarter left off. It is a broad, general study of the great three-
fold message of Rev. 14:6-14, treating it, as it really is in this
stage of the world's history, as one message.
    When a question is wholly answered by a note, it has been
thought best to place the note immediately after the question.
It is not expected, however, that the student shall learn these
notes by heart, but get the facts so given.
    May God bless the study of these wondrous truths• to the
food of all our schools.



        LESSON 1.—January 4, 1896.
THE LAST DAYS.—THE NEED OF A REFORrIATION.

    I. FOR what is the word of God written? 2 Tim. 3 : 16, 17 ;
Rom. 15:4.
   2. According to the prophets, in what time of the - world's
history are we living?
                                                     ( 3)
                THE GREAT THREEFOLD :MESSAGE

     Ans.—There are more than twelve lines of prophecy in the
  word of God which indicate that we are living in the last clays,
 and that the coming of our Lord draweth nigh. Of these we
 may mention those found in the second, seventh, eighth, ninth,
 and eleventh chapters of Daniel, the seven churches, the seven
 seals, the seven trumpets, the two witnesses, the dragon of
 chapter 22, the beasts of chapters 13 and 17 of the book
 of Revelation, as well as the prophetic discourses of our
 Lord. These prophecies also show by definite prophetic data
 that "the time of the end," during which the prophetic periods
 were fulfilled, began in 1798.
    3. What special signs show that we are living in the last
 days?
   Ans.—Increase of knowledge (Dan. 12 : 4, 9, m), spiritual de-
 clension (Matt. 24: I I, 12 ; 2 Tim. 3: 1-5), increase of riches
 (James 5: 1-7), Mormonism and Spiritualism (Matt. 24: 23-26),
 rejection of God's law (Isa. 30: 8, 9, margin), scoffers at Christ's
second coming (2 Peter 3:1-4),• signs in the sun, moon, and
stars (Matt. 24 : 29, 3o; Rev. 6: 12-14), great war preparations
(Joel J:9-14), peace and safety cry by false prophets (Isa. 2:
3-6 ; i Thess. 5: 2, 3), and the great threefold message we are
studying in these lessons (Rev. 14:6-14). All these things
may now be seen fulfilled or fulfilling; and, therefore, " when
ye shall see all these things, know that it [Christ's coming] is
near, even at the doors."
    4. To what important - event do the prophecies of God's
word point? Ans.—The judgment. See Dan. 8 : 14 ; Rev.
JO : 7; 14:7. (See chapter 6 "Christ Our Advocate.")
    5. What is the character of this judgment work?
   Ans.—The beginning of every judgment work is the exami- .
nation or investigation of cases brought before the judge.
While the Lord knows the cases of all men without any period
of time for examination, in His wisdom, and for the good of
those who serve Him, He has given a time for this purpose.
Eccl. 3: 17. That a judgment precedes Christ's coming and
the first resurrection is shown by the fact that those only are
raised from the dead who are accounted worthy of immortality
    OUR SABBATH SCHOOL CONTRIBUTIONS THIS QUARTER
              THE GREAT THREEFOLD MESSAGE.

(Luke 20 :35; i Cor. 15 : 52); the dead are not raised, and then
changed, but they come up immortal, showing that their cases
have already been decided. This judgment may, therefore, be
called the investigative judgment.
    6. Where will this judgment begin? r Peter 4: 17.
    7. What does our Lord say of the condition of the church in
the last days? Matt. 24: II, 12.
    S. What. testimony is borne by the apostle Paul? 2 Tim.
3: 1-5.
    9. What is the cause of this abounding iniquity? Verse i.
  1o. What are the evidences of carnality and selfishness?
  Cor. 3: 3. See note r.
   11. What is the effect of carnality? James 3 : 14-16.
   12. By what term does the Lord express the condition of the
natural heart? Jer. 17:9. Revised Version, "Desperately sick."
   13. What would be the condition of a church controlled by
such persons? Isa. i : 5, 6.
   14. By what term does Inspiration characterize this division
and confusion in the religious world? Ans.—" Babylon."
See Rev. 14: 8 and note 2.
   15. How does the condition of the religious world at the pres-
ent time agree with the word of prophecy?
   Ans.—The professed Christian church is divided into numer-
ous denominations. Not only this, but many members of each
of these denominations are divided as to what the word of
God teaches, or else are divided among themselves over such
great and important Bible doctrines as the Inspiration of the
Bible, the Atonement, the Prophecies, the Second Coming of
Christ, etc. There is no term which could more fittingly
describe the condition of the professed church of Christ in this
century than Babylon—confusion.
   16. What was a prominent characteristic of the apostolic
church? Acts 4: 32, first part.
   17. What is the Lord's desire respecting His people in all
ages? John 17: II, 20; i Cor. is m.
   IS. What would be the effect of such unity? John 17: 21.
   19. How alone can it be brought about?        Verse 23; Rom.

        FOR MISSION WORK IN THE SOUTHERN STATES.
6              THE GREAT THREEFOLD :MESSAGE.

  zo. How willing is God to give us this spirit of union and
power and love? Luke 11: 9-13.
  21. That God may bring His people to this unity and prepare
them for the judgment, what message has He sent them? Rev.
14: 6, 7.

                             NOTES.
   1. "CARNAL" means "fleshly;" he who is carnal is ruled by-
the lusts of his own flesh. But this is selfishness. Where self-
ishness is there must necessarily be division; for each one
will be for himself. There may be seeming union at times, but
it is the union of fear or policy, and not the union of the prin-
ciples of love. Division leads to confusion and every evil work.
   2. "BABYLON" is from Babel, meaning confusion. See Gen.
Io : 1o, margin, and II: 9, margin. The Lord does not by this
term denote the moral attitude of the professed church, but
their condition of division and confusion.



      LESSON 11.—January 11, 1896.
 THE EVERLASTING GOSPEL—WHAT IS IT?—ITS
                 POWER.

   REVIEW QUESTIONS. — (a) In what period of the world's
history are we living? (b) What is the condition of the re-
ligious world? (c) What is necessary that the church may be
ready for the Lord?
    1. Repeat the message given in Rev. 14:6, 7.
    2. What is symbolized by the angel?
   Ans.—The word "angel" signifies messenger. Angels are
God's ministers, or messengers, and fellow-servants with His
people in the great plan of salvation. (See Heb. 1: 14; Dan.
7: 16; 8 : 16; 9 : 21, 22; IO: II, 12; Rev. 22 :9, and other scrip-

tures.) In symbolic prophecy, therefore, angels not only show-
God's care and supervision over the work predicted, but also,
symbolize His people who are giving the gospel to the world..

 changes the sinner? Eph. 2 : 10.
   19. What power, therefore, is pledged to all in the everlast-
 ing gospel? Ans.-Creative power. Isa. 4o:28, 29.
   20. For whom, then, is there hope? John 3 :16.

         FOR MISSION WORK IN THE SOUTHERN STATES.
               THE   GREAT THREEFOLD MESSAGE.

                             NOTES.

     a. THE JUDGMENT.—The people represented by this ,angel
      not,like Paul, predict a judgment to come (Acts 17:31; 24:25),
but that the hour of God's judgment is come. The judge is
already on the judgment seat. The cases are already called.
That judgment began in the investigation of the cases of the
 righteous in 1844.
    '2. PREVIOUS to this God had given the world the great ad-
vent message of 1840-44, symbolized by the angel of Revela-
tion to, clothed with a cloud, with a rainbow upon his head,
and having great power. The cloud indicated obscurity. It
was supposed that the Lord would come in 1844; the truth con-
cerning the nature of that event was hidden to try those who pro-
fessed it. The joy of believing and the bitterness of disappoint-
ment experienced in that movement are symbolized by the little
book—first sweet, and then bitter. The power of the message
is indicated by the mighty angel, his great voice, and by the
fact that he came down from heaven to earth. But, though the
message was obscure and the disappointment bitter, hope was
held out before God's people in the covenant bow. The angel
of chapter to symbolized the power and effect of the 1840--44
message. The angel of chapter 14:6 in its fullest sense repre-
sents the gospel message in its clearness, a part of the great
threefold message of God to man, beginning in 1844.
    3, IT is the same message which God has given to sinful man
since the fall. It is "the everlasting gospel" of the "everlast-
ing covenant." Isa. 55 :3; Heb. 13 : 20. It was preached to
man after the fall, and the faith of the righteous was shown in
the shedding of the typical blood. It was preached to Abraham
(Gal. 3 : 8), and with him was the everlasting covenant con-
  irmed. It was preached to the children of Israel (Heb. 4 2;
s Cor. so : 1-9). 1 Chron. 16 : 7-35 is but an expansion Of the
thought expressed in Rev. 14 : 6, 7. Note especially verses 23
to 33. It is the same message of salvation to all the world; it
is given by the same true and living God, to whom is due the
     OUR SABBATH SCHOOL CONTRIBUTIONS THIS QUARTER
              THE GREAT THREEFOLD MESSAGE.                      9

same fear and honor and worship, the One who will judge the
earth and reign forever.
  4. THE result is in the first sin. The oak tree is in the acorn.
In the very beginning of sin is death. God knows it and would
save us from it. Unbelieving men will not believe that death
is in sin. They hope to enjoy the sin and evade the death.
Faith will believe God now, and evade death by abstaining
through grace from sin.
  5. GOD does not force us to obey, or compel us to believe in
Him. He manifests love that He may win us, but, whether we
believe or not, we have our own choice. Our relation to God is
wholly voluntary. This point it is well to bear in mind all
through this lesson study. God, in His love, pleads, but He
will not compel. Whatever it be that seeks to compel religious
belief or practice is not of God.

works, and of these His Sabbath is a remembrancer. But what
He was for His people then in the creation of the world, He is
to them now in recreating, upholding, preserving. The power of
the word which He spoke during the six days of creation is still
manifest in upholding and perpetuating the things He has made.
It is manifest in the re-creation of souls born into the kingdom
of God. The Lord is a very present help in trouble, and the
Sabbath is to us the sign of His almighty present power in and
for us.



    LESSON IV.—January 25, 1896.

      THE FEAR, GLORY, AND WORSHIP OF GOD.

 REVIEW QUESTIONS.— (a) Through what is the power of
God manifest to save men? (b) What is its effect upon those
who receive it? (c) For how long is it to be offered to the
world?
                       THE FEAR OF GOD.

    I. What duty does the message first enjoin? Rev. 14: 7,
first clause.
    2. What is meant by fear?
   Ans.—The word "fear" in its primary sense expresses ter-
ror, apprehension, dread. When enjoined as a duty or Chris-
tian grace, it refers to reverence; it is awe and love combined.
If we know God, we will have some sense of His wondrous,
dreadful, and ineffable glory and of our own utter insignifi-
cance:- In the light.of His glory will we see our shame; in the
light of:FES- holiness, our sin; in the light.of HiS Purity, oural--
ruption; and when we see that all these perfections are given
in love through Christ to save us, it creates love within our
hearts, and fear and love combine in reverence. These views
of self and God will lead us to choose God's will and way in
        FOR MISSION WORK IN THE SOUTHERN STATES.
I2            THE GREAT THREEFOLD MESSAGE.

preference to our own. It is this wisdom which leads to, the
keeping of the commandments of God. He who chooses his
own way, or the way of men, in preference to that of God, has
not the fear of God before his face.
   3. Of what is this reverence the beginning? Ps. III: to, first
clause.
   4. To what will it inevitably lead? Job 28: 28; Ps. tit: io.
                    GIVING GLORY TO GOD.

    5. What is God's glory?
  Ans.—God's glory is His goodness, His character. When
Moses asked God, " Show me Thy glory," the Lord answered,
"I will make all My goodness pass before thee." Ex. 33: IS,
T9. This the Lord did, as recorded in Ex. 34 :5-7.
    6. In what is His character summed up? I John 4 : S.
    7. How has He Manifested this love toward us? John 3 : 1 6.
   8. What is our duty to Him? Rev. 14:7; first part; Matt.
22: 37.
   9. How does the wise man express this Same truth? Eccl.
12:13.
  to: How does Jesus say we are to glorify God? John 15:8.
What kind of fruits are these? Phil. 1:11.
  it. In view of what are we exhorted to give glory to God?
Rev. 14 : 7, second clause; Eccl. 12 : 14.
  12. What is the rule of the judgment? Rom. 2: 12; James
2:10-12.
  13. What are we to conclude from these scriptures?
  Ans.—(a) That, as God's glory is His character, that charac-
ter is manifest in His holy law, the rule of his government.
(6) That to render this glory to Him is to obey that law, or to
submit to let that law work out in us God's character. In
other words, fearing God and giving glory to Him -is equivalent
to fearing God and keeping His commandments. This is em-
phasized by the fact that the law of God is the great rule of
judgment.
  14. How only may we do these things? John 6 : 28, 29. -

   15. What further duty is enjoined in the gospel? Rev. 14 : 7,
last part.
   16. Whom are we to worship?
   17. What is this great Creator said to be? Jer. to: to, first
part, compare with verse 12. See note t.
  18. What is the Creator's memorial? Ps. III: 4; Ex. zo: 8-11.
   19. Of what is this memorial also a sign? Eze. 20 : 12.
   zo. How should we worship God? 1 Chron. 16:29; John
4 : 23, 2 4.
   21. What is the evidence of true worship? Luke 4:8. See
note 2: _•
   22. Could we worship God in truth, and truly be His serv-
ants, and yet disregard His commandments? Luke 6:46.

                             NOTES.
  I. JEHOVAH is the true God. There are no other gods save
Him. This is evident from the further fact that He is the living
God. He not only has life, but He is the source of life, having all
power, not only to create, but to uncreate and re-create. He,
therefore, is an everlasting King. This is what He desires to be
to all in His creative power manifest in the gospel. He is not
merely a Creator of ages ago. He is a Creator now, the great
living, present I AM, a present Helper, Saviour, Redeemer,
Sanctifier. Faith in the creative power of God is ever and al-
ways its present application through the gospel to our souls'
need. Of this present work of saving, re-creating man, the
Sabbath—God's creative memorial—is a sign. It ever reminds
us that the God of the Sabbath is the living God.
   2. WORSHIP HIM.—We truly worship that which we truly
serve. Service, or obedience, is the test of love and worship.
The text also shows that the great world, to whom the message
 is addressed, is fearing, giving glory to, and worshiping some
other power than the Creator. The gospel is given in its purity
 to call them to the worship of the living God, the Creator of
 the heavens and earth, the sign of whose power the Sabbath is.

      LESSON V.—February 1, 1896.
                   THE FALLING AWAY.


   REVIEW QUESTIONS. —(a)     What is meant by " fear God "?
(b) What is giving glory to   God? (c) What must always be
included in truest worship?
    I. What was the church of Christ in the apostolic age de-
clared to be? Ans.—The temple of God. Eph. 2 : 19-22.
    2. Who was the head of the church? Eph. I : 22, 23.
    3. By what other relation is the union between Christ and
His church symbolized? 2 Cor. II : 2.
    4. By what means was the work of the church to be pro-
moted or built up? Acts 20 : 32.
    5. What was the result of the use of this means? Acts 2 : 4T,
42, 46, 47.
    6. As long as the church was fed upon the pure word of
God, who was her leader? John io : 3, 4.
    7. What was thus manifested to the world? Col. i : 26, 27.
    8. What did the apostle declare would take place?. Acts
20 : 29 7 30. See-note i.
    9. What does the apostle term this turning away from Christ
to men? 2 Thess. 2 : 7.
   10. How does the apostle speak of the full development of
this power? Verses 3, 4.
       Why was the mystery of iniquity not fully revealed in the
apostle's day? Verse 7.
  12. In what was shown the first evidence of falling away?
Ans.—Following men instead of Christ. See Acts 20 : 30.
   23. To what did this lead?
  Ans.—Following men instead of Christ led to the adoption of
heathen ceremonies and customs, advocated by so-called phi-
losophers and wise men. Says Mosheim, "There is good
reason to suppose that Christian bishops multiplied sacred rites
for the sake of rendering the Jews and the pagans more friendly

to them." The half-converted pagans were allowed, "at the
sepulchers of the martyrs on their feast days, to dance, to use
sports, to indulge conviviality, and to do all the things that
the worshipers of idols were accustomed to do in their temples
on festival days." "The Christians . . . not only applied
the terms used in the pagan mysteries to Christian institutions,
particularly baptism and the Lord's Supper, but they gradually
introduced also the [pagan] rites which were designated by
those terms. . . . A large part, therefore, of the Christian
observances and institutions, even in this century, had the as-
 pect of the pagan mysteries."—Misrdock' s Translation, book r,
 century 2, part 2, chap. 4, sections 2 (with footnote) and S.
   14. What was the most widely prevalent heathen worship?
    Ans.—SuN WORSHIP.—"The oldest, the most widespread,
 and the most enduring of all the forms of idolatry known to
 man, viz., sun-worship."—Talbot W Chambers, D. D., in Old
 Testament Student, January, 1886.
    15. What day was especially devoted to sun worship?
    Ans.—The great day dedicated to this worship was the first
 day of the week—Sunday. See Webster, Worcester, Century,
 or Standard Dictionary.
    16. How early was the tendency to adopt heathen customs
 manifested on the part of the professed church? Ans.—It was
 manifested in the apostle's day. See note 2.
    17. In respect to what and by whom was the arrogancy of
 the mystery of iniquity first manifested?
    Ans.—The first arrogant claim of which we have record was
 made by Victor, bishop of Rome (A. D. 193-202), in behalf of
 Sunday. Rome had begun to celebrate the Passover, or the
  heathen feast of Easter, on Sunday, and "Victor, bishop of
  Rome, thought it necessary that the Asiatic Christians should
  be compelled by laws and decrees to follow the rule adopted"
  by the Western church. He, therefore, wrote them an "im-
  perious letter" admonishing them to follow the example of
  other Christians in keeping Easter, to which they replied with
  spirit, "that they would not depart from the holy institution of
  their ancestors." Victor, therefore, in wrath "excluded them

from his communion and from that of his church (Rome)."--M.
   18. In thus turning to the word of men instead of the word
of God, what did the church do? Ans.—It erected another
standard than the word, and finally set up creeds and decrees
of councils as the rule of faith.
   19. In what did this result? Ans.—In erecting as standards
the creeds of men, inevitable confusion and strife resulted.
   2o. By what term in the Scriptures is this confusion charac-
terized? Ans.—Babylon, confusion. Rev.             : 8.
   21. To what did the adoption of worldly standards lead?
   Ans.—When worldly standards were erected by the church,
she could no longer plead God's word and power, and, there-
fore, she turned to the world to obtain power.
   22. When was this union of the church with the state formed?
Ans.—In the reign of Constantine, A. D. 313-337.
   23. lArhat is said of the bishops at that time? -
   Ans.—"Worldly-minded bishops, instead of caring for the
salvation of their flocks, were often but too much inclined to
travel about, and entangle themselves in worldly concerns."
"This theocratical theory of government was already the pre-
vailing one in the time of Constantine; and . . . the bishops
voluntarily made themselves dependent on him by their dis-
putes, and by the determination to use the power of the state
for the furtherance of their aims."—Neander's History of the
Christian Religion and Church, vol. 2, sec. 2, part z, division
1, par.     The outcome of all this was foretold in 2 Thess.
2 : 3, 4.
   24. To what did this man-made theocracy inevitably lead?
Ans.—To deifying man and putting him in the place of God.
   25. What did the apostle predict concerning this? 2 Thess.
2 : 3, 4.

                           NOTES.
  I. MARK that in the very church itself should "men arise,
speaking perverse things [things contrary to the truth of God's
word], to draw away disciples after them." Self-exaltation is

the object of the promoter of error, as it is the very foundation
of the mystery of iniquity. The true minister points the disciple
to Christ; the minister of Satan draws the disciple after him-
self.
  2. NOTE that, (1) The great mass of the world in Paul's day
were heathen. (2) The greatest universal heathen worship was
sun-worship. (3) The great and universal day of sun-worship
was Sunday, besides other monthly and yearly feasts. (4) The
Galatian Christians were converted heathen. Gal. 4 :8. (5) In
their backslidings they turned back to the beggarly elements
of the world, to which they were in bondage before they knew
Christ. Verse 9. (6) One great evidence of this was that they
returned to observing times and days. Verses to, 11. (7)
The only obvious inference is that these days were heathen
days and times (Lev. 19 : 26) and would naturally include among
them the Sunday. See "The Lord's Day," pp. 33-41, 87-91.



     LESSON VI.—February 8, 1896.
                          BABYLON.

  REVIEW QUESTIONS. — (a) By what is the union between
Christ and His church symbolized? (b) By what means was
this union to be maintained? (c) What took place in the church
soon after the apostle's day? (d) To whom did she turn?
   1. What message follows the message of Rev. 14 : 6, 7?

IS            THE GREAT THREEFOLD MESSAGE.


                       ORIGIN OF TERM.

   6. What is the origin of the term "Babylon "? Gen. to : to,
margin; II : 9.
   7. What was the original meaning of the word to the natural
man?
  Ans.—The original word from which Babylon came was
Bab-ilu, which in the Semitic language means the "gate of
God," the way to heaven. See "Story of the Nations—Chal-
dea, " by Ragozin (Putnam), pp. 125, 249; "Manual of Ancient
History of the East," by Lenormant, vol. 1, p. 24.
   8. What was the object and the motive of the people in
building the tower of Bab-ilu. Gen. II : 4. See note 2.
   9. What did the Lord pronounce this scheme of self-
salvation to be?. Verses 7-9, margin. See note 3.
  10. What spirit has been characteristic of Babylon both literal
and symbolical through the world's history? Dan. 4 : 3o; Isa.
47 : 8, io; Rev. 17 :4; 18 : 7; compare with 46 : 9.
       In whom does this spirit of self-exaltation find its source?
Isa. 14: 12-14; Eze. 28 : 17, first part.
  12. What is the true spirit of Christianity in contrast with
this? Matt. 16 : 24.
  13. How was this spirit of self manifest in the early apostasy?
  Ans.—The bishops of the Christian church multiplied rites
and ceremonies and holy days. They said by this that God's
word and wisdom were not sufficient ; it required their wisdom
and their words to make God's plan effectually the "gate of
God;" but, as of old, God pronounced it Babylon—confusion.
  14. What was the next inevitable step for Babylon to take?

              THE GREAT THREEFOLD MESSAGE.

   Ans.—Observance of Sunday, the day dedicated by the hea-
then to the sun. "That very day was the Sunday of their
heathen neighbors and respective countrymen, and patriotism
gladly united with expediency in making it at once their Lord's
day and their sabbath."—North British Review, vol. 18, p.409.
See "The Lord's Day the Test of the Ages," pp. go-95.
  16. What did the apostate church secure from the state?
  Ans. —The very first Sunday law of which we have record
was made on March 7, 321 A. a, by Constantine: "On the
venerable day of the sun let all magistrates and people
residing in the cities, rest, and let all workshops be closed.
In the country, however, persons engaged in agriculture may
freely and lawfully continue their labor, because it often hap-
pens that another day is not so suitable for grain sowing, or for
vine planting, lest by neglecting the proper moment for such
operations, the bounty of heaven be lost."—Schaff-Herzog En-
cyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Art. Sunday Legislation.
   17. What important decision was made by the Council of
Nice, convened by Constantine? Ans.—That Easter should
always and everywhere be observed on Sunday. See note 4.
   18. Who was bishop of Rome during this part of Constan-
tine's reign? Ans.—Sylvester, from January 31, 314, to Decem-
ber 31, 335.
   19. What did he decree by "apostolic authority" shortly
after the Council of Nice? Ans.—That Sunday should be called
the Lord's day. See " HiStory of the Sabbath," p. 351.
   20. What was decreed by the Council of Laodicea, A. D. 364?
Ans.—That if Christians should rest on the Sabbath, " let them
be accursed from Christ." See " Prynne's Dissertation on the
Lord's Day," pp. 34-44.
   21. What followed these decrees?
   Ans.A more rigid law followed, in 386. The church teach-
ers in 401 petitioned the emperor that " public shows might be
transferred from the Christian Sunday to some other day of
the week, that the faithful might not be disturbed," and that
the people might be restrained from attending the theaters,
which were " vastly more frequented than the church." In

fact, the same reasons for a Sunday law were given then as are
used now. These shows were first prohibited by law in 485.
(See "Rights of the People," pp. 215-237.) Thus the church
appealed to and received aid from the state, which she never
would have needed, says Neander, if it had not been for "that
secular spirit which in this period seized upon the church."
Babylon was in unlawful union with the kings of the earth.
  22. What grew out of this? Ans.—The full development of
the "man of sin," the " mystery of iniquity," foretold in
2 Thess. 2 :3, 4, 7.

                            NOTES.
   I. WHATEVER we may learn Babyton to mean, it is shown in
Rev. 14 :8 that the term is applied to some system or body of
which it is unlawful to unite with the kings of the earth; for for-
nication is unlawful union. It cannot, therefore, refer to a
literal city; for a literal city may properly be connected with
the kings of the earth. By comparing Revelation 12, where
the true church of God is symbolized by a pure woman perse-
cuted, with Revelation 17, it will be clearly seen that Babylon •
represents an apostate church, which claim's to be true, and,
therefore, through union with the governments of the earth,
persecutes the true church.
  2. NoTIcE that this work was not done for God's glory, but
by and for self. "Let us build us ' a tower, whose top may
reach unto heaven ; and let us make us a name." It was self-
salvation all through.
  3. THus it is with every device of man to save himself, to
climb into heaven by his own power or righteousness. The
scheme may be beautiful, and man may call it the "gate of
God," but God calls it what it truly is,—confusion.
  4. NOT only was the Council of Nice called by the Emperor
Constantine, but Neander (vol. 2, p. 133) says that the decrees
" were published under the imperial authority, and thus
obtained a political importance."

    LESSON V11.—February 15, 1896.

               THE BEAST.—WHAT IT IS.

  REVIEW QUESTIONS. —(a) What is the origin of the term
Babylon? (b) What did it mean to the worldly wise? (c) By
what means did the church become Babylon? (d) To what,
then, did she seek for succor? (e) What did this act consti-
tute? Rev. 14:8.
    i. What relation noes the third angel of Rev. 14:9 bear to
the angel of verses 6, 7?
   Ans.—He " followed them," or went with them. That the
word " follow " means to go with, see Matt. 4: 20, 22; Mark
2: 14, and many others. The first message leads out, the others
follow with, as the disciples followed Jesus. The first message
is positive; the second and third, negative. Every positive
truth is embraced in the first message.
    2. Against what does the third angel warn us? Rev. 14:9.
    3. What fearful penalty shows the importance of heeding
this warning? Verses to, r r.
    4. Where is the beast, against which we are warned, brought
to view? Rev. 13: 1-10.
    5. ,What prophetic symbol is parallel to this?
   Ans.—The little horn of Daniel 7. They arise in the same
territory, do the same work, possess the same character, and
continue the same length of time. They are, therefore, iden-
tical.
    6. What four kingdoms are symbolized in Daniel previous
to the rise of the little horn? Dan. 7: 1-7. See note 1.
    7. How were these symbols represented in the beast of Rev-
elation 13? Verse 2.
    8. What eleven distinct specifications are given in the proph-
ecy concerning the little horn?
   Ans.—(1) It was to arise in a ten-divisioned kingdom.
 Verse 8.
        FOR MISSION WORK IN THE SOUTHERN STATES.
22            TIDE OkEAT TIMEEPotb MESSAGE.

   (2) It was to be different in nature and character from the
others. Verse 24.
   (3) It would cause the overthrow of three kings. Verses 8,
20, 24.
   (4) It would possess great shrewdness and foresight (eyes
like those of man). Verses 8, 2o.
   (5) It would be strong and vigorous (stout). Verse 2o.
   (6) It would be a blaspheming, assuming power. Verses 8,
II, 20, 25.
    (7) It would be a persecuting power. Verses 21, 25.
    (8) It would presume to change God's law. Verse 25, R. V.
    (9) It would be a persecuting power for three and one-half
prophetic years, or 1,26o literal years. Verse 25.
   (to) It would then lose its persecuting power, and, shortly
after, its own dominion. Verses 25, 26.
   (I1) Its power to persecute would be restored, for it would
make war on the saints till the end. Verses 21, 22.
    9. How many of these specifications do we find in connec-
tion with the beast of Rev. 13: 1-to? Ans.—Specification I
(ten horns), 6 (blasphemous), 7 (persecuting), 8 (causing false
worship through a changed law), 9 (42 months), 10 (deadly
wound), it (deadly wound healed).
   10. In what power or system alone are all these specifica-
tions met? Ans.—In that system known as the Papacy. See
note 2.
    r. What is represented by all these beast kingdoms? Ans.
—Church and state governments, or persecuting powers.
  12. What constitutes a persecuting power?
   Ans.—There must in some way be a union of church and
state, or of religion with the state. A religious organization
apart from civil power cannot persecute; and a civil power apart
from religion will not persecute. The union of the two in active
operation always results in injustice and oppression.
  13. When did the Papacy secure the power to persecute?
   Ans.—A. D. 538, when the last kingdom which opposed Rome's
assumptions, was plucked up, and the bishop of Rome was
made, by decree of Justinian, head of all the churches and true
     OUR SABBATH SCHOOL CONTRIBUTIONS THIS QUARTER

and only corrector of heretics. By this twofold means was it
established. The emperor had decreed it in A. D. 533 (see
"Croly on the Apocalypse," pp. 167-171); and when the last of
the three opposers,. the Ostrogoths, was overthrown, the Papacy
began its career as a persecuting power.
   14. Beginning in A. D. 538, when would the 1,26o days,-or
years, end?              1798.
   15. What event marked their close? Ans.—Under General
Berthier, an officer acting under the French directory, the
Papacy was abolished in 1798, Rome was proclaimed a republic,
and Pope Pius VI. was taken captive, dying at Valence, France,
August 29, 1799.
   16. What scripture was thus fulfilled? Rev. 13:3 (first part),
 10.
   17. Did this act of France affect the ecclesiastical or religious
 organization of the Papacy? Ans.—No; it removed the head
for a while; but soon after the death of Pius VI., the cardinals
met and elected, March 14, 1800, Barnabas Chiaromonti to the
papal see, and, under the name of Pius V11., "within a few
months of his election, he entered his capital as a sovereign
prince." See "Murdock's Mosheim," sketch of nineteenth cen-
tury, par. 1. But papal rule over other countries was broken.
The blow took away his power to persecute. He was no
 longer acknowledged by the powers of Europe "head over
all the churches and corrector of heretics."


                             NOTES.

  I. THE lion represents Babylon (Jer. 4:7, 13); the bear, Bab-
ylon's successor, Medo-Persia (Dan. 8: 20); the leopard, Grecia
(Dan. 8: 21), and the terrible nondescript beast, Rome, which
succeeded Grecia (Deut. 28:49-51; Dan. 8 : 23-25). The fourth
beast had ten horns, indicating the ten divisions-of the Roman
Empire (Dan. 7 : 24) between the years A. D. 351 and 476.
  2. THE papal power grew out of the working of the mystery

  of iniquity, the assumptions of the bishop of Rome particularly,
  and the union of the apostate church—Babylon—with the kings
  of earth. This work began in Constantine's time, but the
  Papacy as a distinct power was developed later. Note the ful-
  fillment of the prophetic specifications. (t) It arose in Rome
  in her divided state, when just ten kingdoms existed. The last
  of the ten kingdoms arose in 476. (2) It was diverse in nature.
 The other powers were civil powers, but the Papacy was civil
 and religious combined, or an ecclesiastical power having civil
 authority. (3) Because of it three kingdoms were plucked up, —
 the Heruli, 493; Vandals, 534; and Ostrogoths, 538. (4) The
 nature of the ten kingdoms was that of a beast, blind to the
 future, represented by natural horns; but the "little horn" had
 not only eyes, but man's eyes in a beast's horn, showing great
 shrewdness and foresight. This has been preminently true of
 the Papacy. It has plotted and planned for the centuries to come,
 while other nations have looked only to the present. (5) "More
stout than his fellows." And this also is true of the Papacy.
Other governments and kingdoms have fallen, but the Papacy
remains. (6) And truly it has been a blasphemous power,
assuming God's prerogatives, and perverting his word. (7) It
has put to death millions of the people of God, those adjudged to
be heretics. (8) "Think to change the times and the law."
(R. V.) It has done this with respect to the fourth command-
ment, which will be considered more fully later. (9) "Time"
is one year; "times," dual, two years; "half a time" (R. V.),
half a year, or, as in Revelation 13: 5, 42 months, at 3o days to
the month, Bible reckoning, 1, 26o days, or years (Eze. 4: 6), be-
ginning A. D. 538, and ending in 1798. (io) In 1798 it lost its
power to persecute, and in 1870 its last vestige of territorial
dominion, or civil authority, passed from under its control. All
these have been fulfilled in the Papacy and in no other power.
The last specification, the Lord declares, will be fulfilled, and
the Papacy will be a persecutor to the end. See Rev. 13 : 3;
Dan. 7: 21, 22; 2 Thess. 2 :8.

   LESSON VI11.—February 22, 1896.
           THE PROTESTANT REFORrIATION.


   REVIEW QUESTIONS.—(a) How early did the apostasy begin?
tb) When were church and state first united? (c) When was
the Papacy fully set up? (d) What was its character? and how
long did it continue a persecuting power? (e) What caused its
persecuting power to cease?
    1. By what great movement was the influence of the Papacy
over the nations weakened? Ans.—By the great Protestant
Reformation of the sixteenth century.
    2. In what country and under what servant of God was the
Reformation most prominent? Ans.—In Germany, under Mar-
tin Luther. See note.
    3. On what two great principles was the Reformation based?
   Ans.—"The principles contained in the celebrated protest [at
the Diet of Spires] on the 19th of April, 1529, constitute the very
essence of Protestantism. Now this protest opposes two abuses
of man in matters of faith; the first is the intrusion of the civil
magistrate; and the second, the arbitrary authority of the
church. Instead of these abuses, Protestantism sets the power
of conscience above the magistrate, and the authority of the
 word of God above the visible church. In the first place, it
 rejects the civil power in divine things, and says, with the
 prophets and apostles, ' We must obey God rather than man.'
 In the presence of the crown of Charles the Fifth [civil author-
 ity] it uplifts the crown of Jesus Christ. But it goes further; it
 lays down the principle that all human teaching should be sub-

.rj, chap. 6.

 will bring us all to unity of faith in truth, charity, and holiness,
 through Jesus Christ, our throne of grace, and our only Metii-
 ator."—Id., Protest of Spires, par. 8.
     5. How, in their view, was the commandment of. God and
 their soul's salvation affected by numbers?
    Ans.—" It concerns the glory of God and the salvation of our
 souls, and that in such matters we ought to have regard, above
 all, to the commandment of God, who is King of kings and
 Lord of lords, each of us rendering Him account for himself;
 without caring the least in the world about majority or minor-
 ity."—Id., Protest of Spires, par. 7.
     6. What did Luther say as regards the matter of force in
 religion?
    Ans.—"I have made it my earnest prayer that the German
 princes would oppose the Romans by the wisdom of their
 counsel, not by the sword."—Id., book 7, par. 0. Luther asked
 only protection for himself equally with all others.
     7. What does a Protestant authority say of the Protestant
standard?
   Ans.—"The Bible, I say, the Bible only, is the religion of
 Protestants. Nor is it of any account in the estimation of the
genuine Protestant how early a doctrine originated if it is not
found in the Bible. He learns from the New Testament itself
that there were errors in the times of the apostles, and that
their pens were frequently employed in combating those errors.
. . . The consistent and true-hearted Protestant, standing
upon this rock, `the Bible and the Bible only,' can admit no
doctrine upon the authority of tradition; . . . he who
receives a single doctrine on the mere authority of tradition,
let him be called by what name he will, by so doing, steps down
from the Protestant rock, passes over the line which separates
Protestantism from popery, and can give no valid reason why
he should not receive all the earlier doctrines and ceremonies
of Romanism, upon the same authority."—Dowling's History
of Rornanism, book 2, chap. r.

basis of true Protestantism?

   Ans.—" The Reformation was accomplished in the name of a
spiritual principle. It had proclaimed for its teacher the word
of God; for salvation, faith; for king, Jesus Christ; for arms,
the Holy Ghost; and had by these very means rejected all
worldly elements. Rome had been established by the law of a
carnal commandment; the Reformation, by the power of an
endless life." —D' Aubi gne' s History of Reformation, book 1, 1,
par. r.
     9. What power alone could it bring to bear upon rulers and
people?
   Ans.—" Thus one of the greatest tasks of the sixteenth century
was to restore the spiritual element to its rights. The gospel of
the Reformers had nothing to do with the world and with politics.
While the Roman hierarchy had become a matter of diplomacy
and a court intrigue, the Reformation was destined to exercise
no other influence over princes and people than that which pro-
ceeds from the gospel of peace."—Id., par. 3.
   Do. Was the principle of the separation of church and state a
gospel principle? Mark 12 : 17.
    tr. What did Jesus say with reference to the use of carnal
means for the promotion of the gospel? Matt. 26 : 52.
   12. By what means only was His cause to be advanced?
 Zech. 4 : 6.
    13. Why could not the kingdom of God be carried forward by
 carnal means? John 18 : 36.
    14. Why is it impossible for carnal men and means to enforce
 the law of God? Rom. 7 : 14.
    15. In what realm does the real Christian warfare exist? 2
 Cor. IO : 5.

  20. Does the gospel condemn those even who do not believe
in Christ? John 12 :47.
  21. What is the attitude of Christians toward rulers? I Tim.
2 : I-3; I Peter 2 : 13-17.
  22. Yet when human laws conflict with God's law, what is
the Christian's duty? Acts 4 : 19; 5 : 29.
  23. On what, therefore, were the principles of the Prot-
estant Reformation based? Ans.—The everlasting gospel.
Rev. 14 : 6.
  24. If these principles had been followed, what would have
been the result? John 17 : 21-23.

                            NOTE.
  THE Reformation was not confined to Germany. It perme-
ated all Europe, aroused the wrath of the Papacy, and brought
upon the Christians greater persecution. Reaction from this
persecution came when France was depopulated of its best
souls, when all Europe was torn, distracted, and weakened,
when the mystery of iniquity was revealed in its wickedness.
The refuge for the oppressed of all was opened in an unknown
part of the world—America. "The earth helped the woman."
Rev. 12:16. In 1776 Maria Therese, empress of Austria,
issued a decree that all Christians should be tolerated. Shortly
after this (A. D. 1798) the persecuting power of the Papacy was
taken away.

the Reformation based? (b) Who was the author of these
principles? (c) In the setting forth of these principles, what
did the Protestant Reformation preach to the world? Rev.

14 : 6. (d) If these principles had been faithfully carried out, to
what would they have led? Ans.—To unity in Christ, such as
was manifest in the days of the apostles.
    i. Did the Protestant Christians continue to hold to the
Bible, and the Bible alone?
   Ans.—They did not; they felt that creeds were necessary,
that the Bible alone was not sufficient, and, therefore, creeds
were formed. German Christians went no farther than Luther
and Melancthon; Swiss Christians, no farther than Zwingle; the
English divided between the thirty-nine articles and the Cal-
vinistic Confession of Faith. Many other creeds have been
formed since; and these creeds have, when practical tests came,
been- made the standard instead of God's word. This wrought
confusion—Babylon.
    2. Did the various churches continue to protest against " the
intrusion .of the civil magistrate," or a union of church and state?
   Ans.—On the contrary, the principal bodies united with the
state. The Lutheran Church became the state church in Ger-
 many, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, etc. State churches were
established in Switzerland, France, England, and Scotland, in
consequence of which many of those who were once persecuted
 became persecutors.
     3. What does the historian say of the church previous to the
 Reformation?
    Ans.—" If there is any doctrine that distinguishes Christianity
 from every other religion, it is its spirituality. A heavenly life
 brought down to man—such is its work; thus the opposition of
 the spirit of the gospel to the spirit of the world was the great
 fact which signalized the entrance of Christianity among the
 nations. But what its founder had separated, had come together
 again; the church had fallen into the arms of the world; and by
 this criminal union it had been reduced to the deplorable con-
 dition in which we find it at the era of the Reformation."—
 D' Aubigne, History of Reformation, book ft. 2.
     4. What does he say of the Protestant churches, should they
  prove untrue to their principles?

          FOR MISSION WORK IN THE SOUTHERN STATES.
30             THE GREAT THREEFOLD MESSAGE.


   Ans.—"If the Reformation, having attained a certain point,
 became untrue to its nature, began to parley and temporize
 with the world, and ceased thus to follow up the spiritual prin-
 ciple that it had so loudly proclaimed, it was faithless to God
and to itself. Henceforth its decline was at hand. It is impos-
sible for a society to prosper if it be unfaithful to the principles
it lays down. Having abandoned what constituted its life, it
can find naught but death."—Id., tar. ¢, 5, 6.
    5. What did he say of the Protestant churches after the
 Reformation began?
   Ans. —"One portion of the reform was to seek the alliance
of the world, and in this alliance find a destruction full of deso-
lation. Another portion, looking up to God, was haughtily to
reject the arm of the flesh, and by this very act of faith, secure
a noble victory. If three centuries have gone astray, it is
because they were unable to comprehend so holy and so sol-
emn a lesson."—Id., par. 8, 9, ro.
    6. What does the Bible say of the condition of professed
Christians in the last days? 2 Tim. 3: 1-5.
    7. What does it say of their relation to the world? James
4:4.
    8. What have we learned in past lessons concerning the
divided condition of professed Christians? Ans.—It is confu-
sion—Babylon. See lesson 6 and note.
    9. What testimony do eminent men in the professed churches
bear as to the spiritual condition of modern Babylon?
   Ans. —" Many of our congregations are conducted on the
basis of social clubs. They are made centers of social influ-
ence. Membership is sought in order to advance one's pros-
pects in society, business, or politics. Preachers are called
who know how to
              `Smooth down the rugged text to ears polite,
               And snugly keep damnation out of sight.'

The Sunday services are made the occasion of displaying the
elegances of apparel in the latest fashions. If the ' rules are
read, it is to comply with the letter of the law whose spirit

has long since fled. The class-books are filled with names
of unconverted men and women. Official members may be
found in box, dress circle, and parquet of opera and theater.
Communicants take in the races, and give and attend card
parties and dances. The distinction between inside and out-
side is so obscure that men smile when asked to unite with
the church; and sometimes tell us that they find the best
men outside. The enforcement of the unmistakable letter
of the discipline for a single year would cut our membership
in half, bankrupt our missionary society, close our fashionable
churches, paralyze our connectional interests, and leave our
pastors and bishops unpaid and in distress. But the fact
remains that one or two things must happen,—the disci-
pline must purge the church, or God's Holy Spirit will seek
other organized agencies. The ax is laid at the root of the
tree. The call is to repentance. God's work must be done.
If we are in the way, He will remove us."—Bishop Moore, Edi-
tor of Western Christian Advocate (M. E.), Cincinnati, July 59,
1893.
   "Are there no evidences at hand that seem to confirm the
impression that the history of the church in the Roman Empire,
in the fourth century, is repeating itself in the United
States to-day? . . . The blandishments of the world are
too much for human nature to withstand, and we see the sad
spectacle of the great moral and religious activities of the
church, drop down into the rut of the ordinary routine of busi-
ness affairs, while her beautiful and glorious life is shorn of its
spiritual power."—The Hallowed Day, by Rev. George
 Guirey (Baptist), p. 20, Baker & Taylor Co., New York.
Many other testimonies might be given. The above are char-
acteristic of many more.
   ro. What prominent unscriptural dogma is held by all these
 professed churches? Ans.—The Sunday "Lord's day," or sab-
 bath.
    t. What acknowledgment is made as to its origin?
   Ans.—The following admission from the Christian Work,
 (Presbyterian), is characteristic of what many others have said,

        FOR MISSION WORK IN THE SOUTHERN STATES.

who, as the Christian Work, hold to Sunday as the Sabbath,
such as Mr. Gladstone., Canon Eyton, the late Dr. R. W. Dale,
Prof. J. Henry Thayer, and others :—
   "The church has set apart Sunday; but it might have utilized
another day had it chosen 10. Certainly it is futile to attempt
to place Sunday, as we now have it, on a New Testament basis.
Sunday did not become the definite worship day in which all
work was forbidden until in the fourth century it was made so by
government authority in conformity with the sentiment of the
church."— Christian Work, July 11, 1895.
   22. To what source, then, must the professed Protestant
churches seek in order to establish the Sunday sabbath? Ans.
—Obviously to the state, the governments of earth.
  13. Has the church appealed to the state for this purpose?
   Ans.—It has repeatedly, through the American Sabbath
Union, and other religio-political bodies. See "Rights of the
People," part 2, chap. 10.
  14. What does the historian truthfully say will follow when
the church forsakes the principles on which she was founded?
See answer to question 4.
  15. In turning from the word of God to the state, whom did
Babylon forsake?
  16. What follows her unlawful union with the governments
of earth? Ans.—The fall of Babylon. Rev. 14:8. See note.
  17. What does the Lord say of those who thus forsake Him?
Isa. 3o : I, 2.
  18. What is the sure result of such union? Isa. 3o : 3; 31: 3.
  19. To whom instead of Christ does it give place in the tem-
ple of God? 2 Thess. 2 : 3, 4.
  20. What lesson should we learn from this? 1 Cor. to: 12;
Rom. It: 2o, last clause.

                            NOTE.
  THE second angel speaks of the professed people of God not
as individuals, but as a body—Babylon—which has fallen,
because of fornication with the world. The message comes to

individuals, but of Babylon. This is the last part of, the three-
fold fall of Babylon. When the early church departed from
God and imbibed pagan errors, she became Babylon. When
she united with the state, she fell, and, as an organization, was
the body of Christ no longer. ' While the Reformation churches
held fast to the word, Christ was with them. When they crys-
tallized their various errors into creeds and endeavored thus to
confine God's word, they made themselves daughters of Baby-
lon. When some of them united with the state, they fell, and
God had to use other people, called out of Babylon to carry
forward His work. Now among these very churches which
came out of the second Babylon, confusion reigns; and now
great Babylon, including the later daughters, is in adulterous
 union with the kings of earth, and is endeavoring to make
 that union stronger. God calls no church Babylon which holds
 to His word, and follows the light that shines from it, even
 though there are in its membership many who do not know
 Christ. When the controlling influence of a church is down-
 ward, it erects some other standard besides God's word.




         LESSON X.—March 7, 1896.
               AN IMAGE TO THE BEAST.

   REVIEW QUESTIONS. —(a) From what did the Protestant
churches soon depart? (b) What soon became their condition
as regards unity of doctrine? (c) What is the spiritual condi-
tion of these divided churches? ( d) What unscriptural dogma
is held by them in common? (e) To what is appeal made that
the Sunday sabbath may be established.
    i. When a backslidden and divided church unites with the
state, what always results? Rev. 14 :8.
    2. What warning does the Lord in love still send to His peo-
ple? Verses 9-12. See note 1.
        FOR MISSION WORK IN THE SOUTHERN STATES.
34            THE GREAT THREEPOLD MESSAGE.

    3. Against what three things does this message warn?
Verse 9.
    4. What have we found the beast to be? Ans.—The Papacy.
   But note that the " beast " is not the Roman Catholic
Church as such, nor the Papacy as meaning the church. It is
the union of that church with the state.
    5. What occurred in 1798? Rev. 13:3, first part, and verse ri.
    6. Was this to be the end of the first beast power? Verse
3, last part.
    7. What scriptures show that it will be an active, living
oppressor of God's people in the last great conflict? Rev.
14: 9-12; 13:14; 15: 2; 16: 10; 19 : 19, 20.
    8. What power did the prophet see arising when the papal
beast went into captivity (A. D. 1798)? Rev. 13 it.
    9. What prominent characteristics did the beast possess?
Verse II, last part.
   io. Of what are .a lamb and a dragon symbols? Rev. 5:6;
12 : 9.
    1. What would the two horns symbolize?
   Ans.—" Horn " is a symbol of exaltation, power, and honor.
I Sam. 2 : 1, 10. They would here indicate the two leading
features in the government represented by the beast, which are
Christian in origin, and which give the government its promi-
nence and power.
  12. What would be represented by "speaking like a dragon"?
  Ans.—Beast represents government. A government speaks
through its laws. Speaking like a dragon would therefore be
to issue persecuting laws (Rev. 12:13) against the people of
God.
  13. To what, then, in the character of a government must the
symbol of the two-horned beast apply?
   Ans.—To a government just rising to power and prominence
in 1798, which held professedly to two prominent Christian
features that gave it prominence, and which, notwithstanding
this, shall become a persecutor.
  14. What two characteristics of Christianity apart from its
spiritual power give it prominence in the world?
     OUR SABBATH SCHOOL CONTRIBUTIONS THIS QUARTER
              THE GREAT THREEFOLD MESSAGE.                     2,5

   Ans.—Absolute equality of mankind (Acts 17:26), and ab-
solute religious liberty or freedom to believe or not believe
without coercion (John 12: 47).
   15. In what government alone can and do these specifications
find fulfillment? Ans.—In the United States of America. See
note 2.
   16. How great power does the two-horned beast exercise,
and for what purpose is it used? Rev. 13:12.
   17. What. was to be manifest in his territory, and in what ful-
filled? Verses 13, 14. Fulfilling in Modern Spiritualism and
other workings of Satan.
   18. What would these deceptions lead the people to do?
Verse 14, last part.
   19. What did the first beast represent, and what elements
constituted it?
   20. In what, then, would an image to the beast consist?
   Ans.—In a union of church and state, or the church using the
state for the furtherance of her own cause.
   21. What law was .to follow the making of the image? Rev.
13: 15.
   22. What would be fulfilled in this? Verse ix, last clause.

                            NOTES.
  I. IT has ever been true that a backslidden body—one that
has turned from God's word to men, from God's power to the state
—was never reformed in itself. Invariably God's message has
called out those from the fallen church who would do His will
and preach His gospel. Israel went down to Egypt for help, and
their captivity and loss of power followed. Out of the captives
God gathered a faithful band to do His work. The Jewish
church failed, and God called out the apostolic church to do
His bidding. The Roman Church failed, and out of it God
called the churches of the Reformation. Some of these churches
failed to advance, and God called out others to bear His gospel
to the world—such as the Baptist, Methodist, Congregationalist,
Disciple, Adventist. His last " called-out " people will know

no standard but His word, no power but His Spirit. The
third message comes home to every individual soul in great
Babylon.
   2. (a) The prophecy demands a government rising to prom-
inence in 1798. This is met in the United States and no other.
(b) It was to rise out of the earth in contradistinction to the sea.
Dan. 7:1-7; Rev. 13 : 1. "Sea," or waters, represents peoples,
etc. Rev. 17: 15. "Earth," therefore, would indicate territory
outside of the civilized nations of the earth. This is met in
America. (c) The two principles of equality and religious lib-
erty—the freedom to believe or not to believe—are found alone
in the Christian religion of all the religions of earth. It was
these which gave it influence among the lowly and down-
trodden of earth, to know that God loved them as well as
others, and that He respected their rights. These two principles
are found alone in this government of all the governments of
earth. Equality is expressed in the Declaration of Independ-
ence; religious liberty, in the first amendment to the Constitu-
tion. All other governments of note have had a state religion,
or the feature of caste, or both. The symbol applies unequivo-
cally to the United States. Other specifications confirm this.

horned beast? (d) What is its character, and how represented?
(e) What would it deceive the people into doing?
   1. What is an image to the beast?
  Ans.—A union of church and state, by which the church will
use the state to accomplish its own objects.

   2. What have we already seen accomplished in this direc-
tion?
   Ans.—The churches in various ways have brought pres-
sure to bear upon the government until the government has
committed itself in its several departments to the principle of
religious legislation. See note I. •
   3. What further step may be taken by the Federal Govern-
ment?
   Ans.—The next logical step of the government would be
to change the organic law so that it would conform to the
decision of the Supreme Court, though all this may be accom-
plished irregularly by some construction of the Supreme Court.
Man does not know what phase the movement will take.
    4. When governments legislate on the things of God, what
are logically considered the highest laws and the most heinous
crimes? Ans.—The laws relating to man's duty to God and
their violation.
    5. With what is the violation of the highest laws generally
punished? AnS . —With death. See note 2.
    6. What part of the prophecy would be thus easily fulfilled?
Rev. 13:15.
                  THE MARK OF THE 13EAST.
   7. Against what does God warn us besides the beast and his
worship? Rev. 14:9.
   8. What must the mark of the beast be? Ans.—The badge
of his authority, the sign of his power.
   9. What does the mark show him who receives it to be?
  Ans.—A servant. It was a custom anciently to brand slaves
with the mark of their master, as men now brand cattle. The
mark showed to whom the slave belonged and whom he
served.
      :Of whom would the mark of the beast show men to be
worshipers? . Rev. 13:
  Y1; In -worshiping the beast whom would we serve?
  Ans.—To worship the beast is to serve him instead of God.
The real essence of worship is service. Matt. 4: 10.
  12. What would therefore mark the difference between the

              THE GREAT THREEFOLD MESSAGE.

worshipers of the beast and the worshipers of God? Ans.—
The difference in the service rendered.
   13. What would regulate the conduct of the two classes of
servants? Ans.—The law and spirit of their respective earthly
governments.
  •14. What is the rule of God's government? Eccl. 12: 13.
   15. What have we found to be the sign, mark, or badge of
His power? Ans.—The Sabbath.
   16. What would therefore be the mark or badge of the rival
worship, the worship of the beast? Ans.—The rival sabbath,
or that part of the law of the beast which differs from God's law.
   17. What change has the prophet declared this apostate
power would make in God's law? Dan. 7:25, R. V.: "The
times and the law." Spurrel: "The appointed times and the
law," referring directly to that part of the law relating to
God's appointed times, the day and the week, the crown of
which is the Sabbath.
   18. How would this power thus exalt itself? 2 Thess. z:3, 4.
   19. What does the Papacy claim as the mark of its power?
   Ans.—"Q.--How prove you that the church hath power to
command feasts and holy days?
   "A.—By the very act of changing Sabbath into Sunday, which
Protestants themselves allow of. . . .
   "By keeping Sunday they [Protestants] acknowledge the
church's power to ordain feasts, and to command them under
sin."—Abridgment of Christian Doctrine. See " The Lord's
Day," pp. 83 to 85, for other testimony. See also note 3.
• 20. What is there to show that the churches of this country
are using the civil power to enforce the mark of the beast?
   Ans.—Almost every effort thus far made to unite church and
state in this country has had for its center the         question,
and has had Sund'ay.legislation or establiShtheirf as its object.
   21. What, therefore, in the light of the prophecy, is the mark
of the beast? Ans.—Sunday enforced by civil laW.- See note 4.

  1. NOTE the movements and events which have led up, and
contributed to, the present state of things:—
  (a) The National Reform Association, which has been work-
ing for a union of church and state ever since 1863. The litera-
ture and lectures of this organization have leavened the minds
of men in all the various denominations.
  (b) The adoption of the same principles by the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union in 1886.
  (e) The. Prohibition party committed to the same in 1887.
  (d) The American Sabbath Union, organized in 1888, one
object of which is to obtain and secure the enforcement of
religious legislation.
  (e) The Trinity Church decision of the Supreme Court of the
United States, February 29, 1892, declared that "this is a
Christian nation." See " Rights of the People," part 2, chap-
ter 6.
  ( f) The decision by both houses of Congress in the same
year of a religious controversy, the Sabbath question, and the
endorsement of the same by the President, thuS committing the
legislative and executive branches to religious legislation.
  (g) The enforcement of religious laws in various states, thus
bringing persecution upon men for conscience' sake. The fulfill-
ment of the prophecy of Revelation 13 is no longer 'a matter
of prophecy; it is fulfilling before our eyes. The old political
parties are indorsing Sunday laws to either save or win votes.
See NeW York in 2895. See "Rights of the People," chap. 9.
  2. RELIGIOUS persecution, if pursued to the extreme, either
ends in the yielding of the heretic or the death penalty:
bon well says: "It is incumbent on the authors of persecution
previously to reflect whether they are determined to stippOrt it
to the last extreme. They excite the flarne" Which they try to
extinguish; and it soon becomes necessary to chastise the con-
tumacy as well as the crime of the offender. The fine which
he is unable or unwilling to discharge exposes his person to the
severity of the law; and his contempt of lighter penalties sug-

  "The right to use force implies the right to take the life of

  3. MANY sincere Christians have died observing Sunday as
the Sabbath. It was in their heart and will to do God's pleas-
ure, and He accepted them. There are many observing it in
ignorance to-day. It is when men reject light from God's
word that they are condemned; but it is not for man or men
to say when that time is reached. The judgment belongs to
God. It is the duty of the Christian to preach the word.
   4. THE reception of the mark in the forehead would indicate
full assent to the iniquitous assumptions of the beast; receiving
it in the hand would indicate assent to its demand through some
other motive than that of belief.

    12. What will be the mark of power in all this?

wide message warns against both worship and mark, and wliere

  .eceived by Babylon? Ans.—" The test of all religions" (Dr.

                            NOTES.
   1. THE Woman's Christian Temperance Union says again:
" The Woman's Christian Temperance Union, local, state,
national; and world:wide, has one vital organic thought, one
all-absorbing purpose, one undying enthusiasm, and that is,
that Christ shall be this world's king—yea, verily, this world's ,
king in its realm of cause and effect,—king of its courts, its
camps, its commerce,—king of its customs and constitutions.
. . . The kingdom of Christ must enter the realm of law
through the gateway of politics. . . . We pray heaven to
give them (the old political parties) no rest . . . until they
shall swear an oath of allegience to Christ in politics, and march
in one great army up to the polls to worship God."—President's
Annual Address, Nashville Convention, 1887.
   Such utterances as the above, together with the National Re-
form Association, the "Christian Citizenship" movement, and
other indications in the religious world, show that we are on
the eve of a man-made theocracy as verily as was Rome in the
fourth century. See "Rights of the People," pp. 228-237.

  2. SAYS the Chicago Advance, Congregationalist, of August
2, 1894: "The sabbath [Sunday] serves the same purpose to-day
as did the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden. .        . That
man is an anarchist at heart who deliberately flaunts at the
sacredness of the sabbath [Sunday], or sneers at any other
distinct revelation of the law of God."
  Archbishop John Ireland, at the Centennial of Columbus, 0.,
Sept. to, 1888, reported in the American Catholic. News of
September 19, says: "It is the intemperate class that violate our
Sunday laws, and the violator of a Sunday law is the worst of
criminals."
  These and many other utterances show that when sufficient
legislation is obtained, the Sunday will be made a test of citizen-
ship and loyalty.
   3. THESE confederacies and organizations to meet existing
and multiplying evils are constantly increasing; and it is safe
to say that there are but few of any note that have not been
solicited in some way to indorse Sunday laws. They are
building "gates of God," which will prove gates of confusion,

manifold meaning God's wonderful character of justice, mercy,
love, and power, eternally pledged for those who trust Him, is.
an ever-present supply. God is the I AM all things needful
for His people. His name in their foreheads, even as His seal,
signifies that they are made like Him, holy in his holiness.
   16. What further proves that this is the significance of the
name and seal on their foreheads? Rev. 14 :5.
   17. Were they always thus? Rev. 7 : 14.
   /8. What word kept them through the great temptations and
delusions? Rev. 3 :1o; I Peter 1 : 5.

   Ans.—Glorious, eternal, and all-comprehending victory over
      such as was never before realized by any generation,
 through the wonderful name or character of God, which Christ.
 possesses and which he placed upon them. See John 17 :6, it,
26. The two wonderful victories combined were never before
-known by any company; hence, no others could sing the song,
sbecause they havenever had the experience.


                             NOTE.
  THE  company of Rev. 14 : 12 are the last remnant church ex-
isting upon the earth when the Lord comes. See verse 14:
chap. 22 : 27. The company of Rev. 14: 1-5 are those who are
taken to heaven at Jesus' coming, from among the living. They
are before the throne in heaven (verse i); they are redeemed
from the earth (verse 3), and "redeemed," not from the grave,
but "from among men" (verse 4).

THE RIGNIS OF THE PEOPLE                                                 .

                       BY ELDER A. T.     JONES
Contains one of the clearest and most concise presentations of the
great subject of religious liberty that we have yet issued. Only a
hare outline of the book is enough to convince one of its value.
It is written with a view to uniting conciseness with clear and
comprehensive treatment, and contains just those things which
we need and about which we ought to be thoroughly informed.
      "THE THREEFOLD MESSAGE OF REV. 14" is the subject of
the Sabbath school lessons for this quarter, and "The Rights of the
People" is recommended as a valuable companion volume to
aid in the study of the lessons.
     •A number of well-selected illustrations give an added interest
to the volume.
      The book contains fifteen chapters, and is one of permanent
value for reference and study. It contains 384 pages, is issued as
No. 32 of the Religious Liberty Library, and is furnished in neat
 paper covers at 40 cents.
      A finer edition on laid paper and neatly bound in cloth, is
also ready. Price, one dollar. See address below.

    This is the most powerful, convincing and convicting argument on
the great question of the Sabbath we have seen. The arguments brought
forth are unanswerable, and still are not calculated to arouse prejudice.
The historical extracts used are brief and to the point, while the con-
trasts, diagrams, and illustrations are at once simple and comprehen-
sive. The great question of the Sabbath is treated in a reverential and
original manner, that is truly pleasing and instructive. In connection
with the study of the messages this most excellent treatise on the Sab-
bath will be most valuable.
    Just the book to put into the hands of lawyers, editors and statesmen.
