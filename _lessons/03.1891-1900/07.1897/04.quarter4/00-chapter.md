in thine heart; and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children,
and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when
thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou
risest up." Deut. 6 : 6, 7.
    " Parents, set apart a little time each day for the study of the
Sabbath-school lesson with your children."—Mrs. E. G. White.



 PROGRAM FOR FAMILY STUDY OF THE S. S. LESSONS.
    SABBATH.—(After church services or at the close of the
Sabbath.) Read carefully the lesson for the next Sabbath,
and assign verses to be memorized during the week.
    SUNDAY.—Name the persons and places mentioned in
the lesson, and locate the places on the map. Pronounce and
define the hard words.
    MONDAY. —Let each tell what he can of the lesson, and
then read it over, carefully noting the points which were not
remembered.
    TUESDAY.—Repeat verses already committed to mem-
ory. Read the " Spirit of Prophecy" on the lesson, or study
the lesson from the Instructor or Little Friend.
    WEDNESDAY.—Let each give a synopsis of the lesson,
or tell the lesson story. Look up the ancient manners and cus-
toms referred 10.
    THURSDAY.—Name again the persons mentioned, and
tell what each said or did. Give time and place of each event.
     FRIDAY.—Ask the questions from the lesson book, study
the notes, and repeat the memory verses.
    SABBATH.—Let each repeat as much of the lesson scrip-
ture as possible. Give each one the privilege of questioning
others upon the lesson. Relate personal experiences in which
the truths of the lesson have been helpful.


    (This program is simply suggestive and can of course be varied
to suit circumstances, but we do urge upon all the necessity of daily,
systematic study of the scriptures covered by the Sabbath-school les-
sons.)

   SUOQESTIONS TO TEACHERS AND PUPILS.

                 TO BE READ BY ALL.

   STUDY the text thoroughly. Although the lessons
may seem long when considered in relation to the half
hour allowed to them in the Sabbath-school, they are
really very short when considered in relation to the entire
week, which may be devoted to the study of each one.
It should be a comparatively light task for anybody to
become thoroughly familiar with the book of Acts in an
entire year. At the close of that time, every one who
has followed the lessons through, ought to be able to
                                               (3)

locate off-hand any passage or incident, or to give the
main features of any chapter. Each one who conscien-
tiously works to this end, will find that the entering of
the Word gives light.
   To avoid confusion, it is best in general to get the text
of the lesson well in mind before launching out to other
scriptures. It is the book of Acts we are studying, and
this should be studied and learned first of all. Then it
will furnish a good nucleus around which to gather other
portions of scripture. One portion well fixed in• mind,
will help to hold many others.
   Don't confine yourself to the questions given, only let
all your questions be directly on the text. These ques-
tions are suggestive, and not by any means exhaustive.
He who can dispense with the lesson book entirely, and
question directly from the Bible, does the best work; but
let him not fail to stick to the Bible. Ask questions on
the text, and only such as can be answered by the text of
the lesson, or by some parallel scripture.

not occur in this part of the received Greek text; for if
we examine Paul's account in chapter 22, we shall find a
portion of the words which are here omitted.
