       PROGRAM FOR FAMILY STUDY OF S. S. LESSONS,
     SABBATH.—(After church services or at the close of Sabbath.) Review
 the lesson of the day by relating in detail the substance of the leson, recall-
 ing Scripture words and references. Read the lesson for the intermediate
 division for next Sabbath from the Little Friend, and learn the memOrrverSe.
     SUNDAY.—Study the first half of the lesson in the following manner:
     i. Assign a reference to each member of the family, usingthe lessbn
 pamphlet to ascertain what references are used in the lesson.
     2. Then read the texts in their regular order, carefully considering what
 each one says before reading the next one. Be sure to have each member
 of the family understand the meaning of all the words in each text.
     3. Select two texts to be committed to memory through the day.
     4. Repeat the memory verse.
     MON DAY.—Review the portion of the lesson already studied.
     1. Have each one name as many references as he can.
   ' 2. Give each one an opportunity to repeat the two texts that were to be
committed to memory on the previous day.
     3. Assign each one a text found in the first half of the lesson, and let one
member of the family ask the questions from the lesson pamphlet, and, the
 others in turn read the answers given in the texts or in the LgSsoN
 QUARTERLY.
    Then study the last half of the lesson in the same manner that the: fit,
half was studied on Sunday.
    TUESDAY.—Repeat the texts already committed to memory, and 'ask
the questions on the last half of the lesson, being sure that all understand
the questions and the meaning of the words used in them.
    Select two texts to be committed to memory during the day.
    WEDNESDAY.—Repeat the texts already committed to memory, and
review the entire lesson by asking the questions in the LESSON QUARTERLY,
the Instructor, or the Little Friend, as may be thought best. The number
and age of the children would usually indicate which lesson help would be
the best.
    THURSDAY.—Read the lesson notes in the QUARTERLY and those in the.
Sabbath School Worker, and any other helps that may be accessible, and re-
view the intermediate lesson in the Little Friend, or the one found in the
LESSON QUARTERLY. Repeat the texts committed to memory.

                              NOTES.
  2. "FEW images could better express the relationship between
our Lord and His people than that of Shepherd and sheep, so
often applied to God in the Old Testament, and appropriated by
Christ Himself in the New. . . . The Eastern sheepfold is a
mere enclosure surrounded by a palisade. The sheep are brought
into it in the evening, several flocks being committed to the care
of the common keeper, or porter, for the night. In the morning
the shepherds return, and knock at the closely barred door of the
enclosure, which the porter opens from within. Each separates
his own sheep by calling to them; and the sheep respond, disen-
tangling themselves from the rest; and when thus collected, they
follow their own shepherd, wherever he may lead."
  2. " THE entire disputation with the Jews turned on the rights of
our Lord to do as He was doing. What claims had He to assume
such a position among the people? He was setting Himself forth
as the one object of the people's faith and following; but was not
this a self-constituted leadership? He proceeds now to answer

them by an allegory, and under the figure of the true shepherd He
presents His claims as the claims of authority, of ownership, and
of love. . . . He was a divinely appointed shepherd of the
sheep.     . . Christ, the Chief Shepherd, has claims which no
other can have—the sheep are His very own, . . . that owner-
ship being involved in His relation to the creation, and intensified
by His relation to the redemption, of men (r Cor. 6 : 20; Titus
2 : 14, R. V.) . . . The claims of ownership are at once height-
ened and transfigured by the claims of love."
  3. " HE goeth before them." " This is the place ever assigned
to Him in the Old Testament. ' He leadeth me by the still waters.'
 Thou leadest Thy people like a flock.' He permits none of His
own to go along a path which He has not trodden, and in which
He has not had previous experience. . . . Take heart, 0
trembling believer ! However strange and hard your path seems
to you, if you look closely at it you will detect in its dust the foot-
prints of the Shepherd; and where He has preceded you, you need
not fear to follow."
  4. " THE sheep follow him." "The utter dependence of the
sheep on the master shepherd is a beautiful emblem of our attitude
toward our Lord. . . . Let Jesus Christ stand between you
and everything—between you and circumstances; between you
and dreaded trials; between you and temptation; between you
and your attainments in the blessed life; between you and your
projects of Christian usefulness. Follow Him; that is, let Him go
first. If He does not go forward, wait for Him. Every step taken
apart from Him, or in front of Him, will have to be retraced with
bitter tears."
  5. "THE shepherd's life of diligence and caretaking, and his
tender compassion for the helpless creatures intrusted to his
charge, have been employed by the inspired writers to illustrate
some of the most precious truths of the gospel. Christ, in His
relation to His people, is compared to a shepherd. After the fall,
He saw His sheep doomed to perish in the dark ways of sin. To
save these wandering ones, He left the honors and glories of His
Father's house. He says, I will seek that which was lost, and

bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that
which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick. • I
will save My flock, and they shall be no more a prey,' `neither
shall the beast of the land devour them.' His voice is heard call-
ing them to His fold, a shadow in the daytime from the heat, and
for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.'
His care for the flock is unwearied. He strengthens the weak,
relieves the suffering, gathers the lambs in His arms, and carries
them in His bosom."
  6. THERE are numerous instances recorded in the Scriptures
where the heavenly voice has been heard (Ex. 19 : 19; s Kings
19 : 12; Luke 9 : 35; Acts 9 :4, etc.); but the voice of the Shepherd
is recognized in other ways than by the hearing of the ear. " God
speaks to us through His providential workings, and through the
influence of His Spirit upon the heart. . . . God speaks to us
in His word." Compare Ps. 19: 1-4, R. V.; Heb. 12 : 19. "The
Holy Ghost saith, To-day if ye will hear His voice, harden not
your hearts."
   7. THE reading of verses 14 and 15 as given in the Revised
Version seems preferable: "I am the Good Shepherd; and I
know Mine own, and Mine own know Me, even as the Father
knoweth Me, and I know the Father; and I lay down My life for
the sheep." "The mutual understanding between the Eternal
Father and the Son is the only parallel to the mutual understand-
ing of Christ and His people."

               SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.
   I. WHO was the first shepherd mentioned in the Bible? What
other leading characters in Bible history were shepherds?
  2. Christ is Me Door, the Good Shepherd, the True Vine, etc.
Why is it made so definite? Compare Acts 4: 12.
  3. Who are the other sheep . . . not of this fold "?
  4. How many distinct references does Christ make in this lesson
to His approaching death?
  5. How is life only in Christ taught in this lesson?
  6. What cause is here assigned for insanity?

                              NOTES.
   I. THE Feast of the Dedication " was instituted by Judas Macca-
bwus to commemorate the purification of the temple and the re-
newal of the temple worship, after the three years' profanation by
Antiochus Epiphanes. It was held for eight days, commencing on
the twenty-fifth day of the month Chisleu, which began with the new
moon of December." "The weather had been wet and rough, so
that He (Jesus) was fain to avail Himself, like the crowds, of the
shelter of the arcade running along the east side of the temple
enclosure, known as Solomon's Porch, from the fragment of the
first temple, left standing by Nebuchadnezzar."
  2. "THE comparative equanimity with which they (the Jews)
consider the claim of Jesus to be the Messiah, is changed into fury
when they imagine that He claims also equality with God. .        .
No incident could more distinctly prove that the claim to be the
Messiah was in their judgment one. thing, the claim to be divine
another thing. . . . In a word, it was a Messiah the Jews
looked for, not the Son of God. They looked for one with divine
powers, the delegate of God, sent to accomplish His will and to
establish His kingdom, the representative among them of the
divine presence; but they did not look for a real dwelling of a
divine person among them. It is quite certain that the Jews of the
second century thought it silly of the Christians to hold that the
Christ pre-existed from eternity as God, and condescended to be
born as man. No Jew would allow,' says a writer of that time,
 that any prophet ever said that a Son of God would come; but
what the Jews do say is that the Christ of God will come.' . .
This fact, that the Jews did not expect the Messiah to be strictly
divine, sheds light on the real ground of accusation against Jesus.
So long as it was supposed that He merely claimed .to be the
promised Christ, and used the title Son of God' as equivalent to
a Messianic title, many of the people admitted His claim and were
prepared to own Him. But when the Pharisees began to appre•
hend that He claimed to be the Son of God in a higher sense, they
accused Him of blasphemy, and on this charge He was condemned.
. . . When brought before the Sanhedrim, He was first asked,
 Art Thou the Christ? ' .      . He merely says that they them-

selves will one day own His claim. `Hereafter shall the Son of
man sit on the right hand of the power of God.' This suggests to
them that His claim was to something more than they ordinarily
considered to be involved in the claim to Messiahship; and at once
they pass to their second question, `Art Thou the Son Of God? '
and on His refusing to disown this title, the high priest rends his
clothes, and Jesus is there and then convicted of blasphemy."—
Dods.
  3. "MY sheep hear [are hearing] My voice, . . . and I give
[am giving] unto them eternal life." " Hear, and your soul shall
live " There is life in the voice of the Son of God. John 5 : 25.
His words are life. .John 6 : 63. "If we would listen to His voice,
we must let silence reign in the heart. The clamors of self, its
pretensions, its lusts, must be rebuked, and we must put on the
robe of humility, and take our place as humble learners in the
school of Christ." What has been implied in the former teaching
of Jesus, is now expressly stated: He and the Father are one. He
appeals to the Scripture in justification of His claini, in repelling
the charge of blasphemy which His statement had called forth.
He says in effect: " If men were called gods to whom God's word
came—and they are so called in Scripture, which cannot be broken
—appointing them to their office, may He not rightly be called Son
of God who is Himself sent to men; whose original and sole des-
tiny it was to come into the world to represent the Father? . . .
The idea of the purpose for which Christ was sent into the world,
is indicated in the emphatic use of `the Father.' He was sent to
do the works of the Father; to manifest to men the benignity,
tenderness, compassion of the Father; to encourage them to be-
lieve that the Father, the Source of all life, was in their midst,
accessible to them. If Jesus failed to reveal the Father, He had
no claim to make."

               SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.
  I. JEsus says of those whom He designates as "My sheep,"
" They follow Me." Is any further description necessary?
  2. On what charge had the Jews previously sought to slay Jesus?
Is there any essential difference between the two charges?

any charge? In their pretended zeal for God, what were they
really doing?
  4. Christ's use of Scripture is worthy of special study. Mark the
force of the testimony of its own Author that " the Scripture can-
not be broken."
  5. How is life only through Christ taught in this lesson?
  6. What were Christ's credentials from the Father?

   r. "THE eleventh is in some respects the great central chapter
of this gospel of life-even as it does indeed happen to- be also
literally the central chapter." "The ten chapters which precede
have served to indicate how Jesus revealed Himself to the Jews in
every aspect that was likely to win faith, and how each fresh reve-
lation only served to embitter them against Him, and harden their
unbelief into hopeless hostility."
  2. "JESUS had often found the rest that His weary human nature
required at the house of Lazarus in Bethany. . . . A dark
cloud now hung over this quiet home where Jesus had rested.
Lazarus was stricken with sudden illness. The afflicted sisters
sent a message to Jesus: 'Lord, behold, he whom Thou lovest
is sick.' They made no urgent requirement for the immediate
presence of Jesus, for they believed that He would understand the
case and relieve their brother. Lazarus was a firm believer in the
divine mission of Jesus; he loved Him ardently and was in turn
beloved by the blessed Master, whose peace had rested on his
quiet home.. The faith and love which the brother and sisters felt
toward Jesus encouraged them to believe that He would not dis-
regard their distress.      . . The sisters counted the days and
hours that must intervene between the sending of the message and
the arrival of Jesus to their ail. As the time approached when
they should expect Him, they anxiously watched the travelers
who appeared in the distance, hoping to discover the form of
Jesus. . . . Presently their messenger returns, but unaccSm-
panied by Jesus. He bears to the sorrowing sisters the words of
the Saviour, 'This sickness is not unto death.' But the hearts of
the sisters fail them, for lo, their brother is already wrestling with

 the fierce destroyer, and soon closes his eyes in death. . . .
Jesus did not delay going to the relief of Lazarus through want of
 interest in the stricken family; but He designed to make the
sorrowful event of the death of Lazarus an occasion to give un-
doubted proof of His divine power, and unite His disciples to
 Him in a faith that could not be broken. Already some of them
 were questioning in their minds if they had not been deceived in
the evidences of His divine power; if He was really the Christ,
would He not have saved Lazarus, whom He loved? Jesus de-
signed to work a crowning miracle, that would convince all who
would, by any means, be convinced, that He was the Saviour of
the world."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 2, PP. 358, 360, 36.r.
   3. "WHEN Mary and Martha sent to Jesus, their message was—
not, Lord, He who loveth Thee, but—`Lord, behold, He whom
 Thou lovest is sick.' It is not my imperfect love to Him which
comforts me, but His Rniect love to me."
   4. "THE Lord loves thee, and yet He tarries with His conso-
lation! Be still, my Sot-11, for thou shalt yet praise Him for having
refused thee a smaller boon, that He might bestow upon thee a
greater." "The persuasion of Christ's love must be graven in our
hearts so deeply that no semblance of indifference on His part will
ever make the slightest impression upon us. 'This is the victory
that overcometh the world.'"
   5. "IN the forefront of this marvelous chapter stands the affir-
mation, 'Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus;' as if tc
teach us that at the very heart and foundation of all God's deal-
ings with us, however dark and mysterious they may be, we mus.
dare to believe in and assert the infinite, unmerited, and unchane.
ing love of God."
   6. A GLORIOUS experience came to the family at Bethany throug,
the channel of suffering. "Who can estimate how much we owe
to suffering and pain? . . . Suffering robs us of proud self-
reliance, and casts us in an agony at the feet of God. Suffering
pfimes away the leaves in which we rejoiced, that the sap may find
its way into fruit. Suffering isolates the soul, shutting it away
from all creature aid, and surrounding it by a wall of fire. The
leaves of the aromatic plant must be crushed ere they will emit

their fragrance; the ore must be plunged in the furnace ere the
gold is set free; the pebble must be polished on the lapidary's
wheel ere its brilliant colors are apparent."
   7. THE implied request of the sisters seemed for the time to be
unheeded, but this was only that Jesus might "do exceeding
abundantly above all that we [they] ask or think." "When we do
not receive the very things we ask for at the time we ask, we are
still to believe that the Lord hears, and that He will answer our
prayers.• We are so erring and short-sighted that we sometimes
ask for things that would not be a blessing to us, and our heavenly
Father in love answers our prayers by giving us that which will be
for bur highest good,—that which we ourselves would desire, if
with vision divinely enlightened we could see all things as they
really are. When our prayers seem not to be answered, we are to
cling to the promise; for the time of answering will surely come,
and we shall receive the blessing we need most. But to claim that
prayer will always be answered in the very way and for the par-
ticular thing that we desire, is presumption. God is too wise to err
and too good to withhold any good thing from them that walk
uprightly. Then do not fear to trust Him, even though you do
not see the immediate answer to your prayers. . . . We may
have no remarkable evidence at the time that the face of our Re-
deemer is bending over us in compassion and love; but this is
even so."
   8. "IT agrees beautifully with divine decorum, that Scripture
nowhere spealth of any one having died in the presence of the
Prince of Life. If we suppose that death could not have assailed
Lazarus when Jesus was near, the words of the two sisters gain a

                               NOTES.

   I. A GLIMPSE of funeral customs among the Jews is given in the
following extract: "The four days since the death had been sad
ones in the little household. They had fasted all the day after it,
and had since eaten nothing but an occasional egg or some lentils;
for that was the only food allowed mourners for the first seven
days. The corpse .          . had been borne to the grave after a
few hours, an egg had been broken as a symbol of mortality, and
the cottage left to the two survivors. The funeral procession had
been sad enough, with its dirge flutes 'and hired wailing women;
the two sisters and their relations following, and then the neighbors
and friends; for it was held a religious duty in all who could, to
attend a corpse to the grave. At the grave's mouth, the men had
chanted the sublime nineteenth psalm in a slow circuit of seven
times around the bier, on which lay the dead, wrapped in white
linen. The long procession, headed by the women veiled, had
stopped thrice on the wayto the grave, while the leader spoke
words of comfort to the bereaved ones, and tender exhortations to
passers by,—' Comfort ye, comfort ye, ye dear ones ! Lift up your
souls, lift up your souls ! Come to me, all ye who are of sad and
troubled heart, and take part in the sorrow of your neighbors.'
Once more in their desolate home, the sisters, with veiled heads,
even in their own chamber, and with unsandaled feet, sat down
on the earth, in the midst of a circle of at least ten friends or pro-
fessional mourners with rent clothes and dust on their heads.
None spoke until the bereaved ones had done so, but every sen-
tence of theirs was followed by some word of sympathy or comfort,
and by the wails of the mourners. And thus it would be for seven

days, and had been for four, before Jesus arrived; for many friends
had come from Jerusalem to comfort the two sisters."—Geikie.
   2. "JESUS did not desire to meet the afflicted sisters in such a
scene of confusion as their home then presented, so He stopped
in a quiet place by the roadside, and sent a messenger to inform
them where they could find Him."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 2, p.
362.
   3. " THE main teaching of the miracle is announced in the words
of Jesus: ' I am the resurrection and the life.' In this statement
two truths are contained: That resurrection and life are not future
only, but present; and that they become ours by union with Christ.
. . . He assured her that in Him were resurrection and life;
that all, therefore, who belonged to Him were uninjured by death,
and had in Him a present and continuous life."
   4. " CtiEtsT is the resurrection because He is the life. He has
life originally in Himself; His essence is life; in His victorious con-
flict with that death which in our flesh He has power to taste for
us (Heb. 2 : 9) life shows itself as resurrection. . . . Not be-
cause He has risen is He the Living; but because He is the Living,
therefore has He risen. See Rev. 1 : 17, i8, R. V. It was impos-
sible that He should be holden of death (Acts 2 : 24), for the very
reason that He is the Living. And what Christ is, this He imparts
to His believers. John 14: 19.        He is the resurrection of the
dying and the life of the living.' . . . For all His believers is
this precious word of Christ intended." Sight says, " In the midst
of life we are in death; " but faith says, " In the midst of death we
are in life."
   5. " JEsus bade Martha call her sister and the friends that had
come to comfort the afflicted women." " How beautiful is this!
When thy Saviour has been offering Himself to thee to be thy
consolation and light, thy resurrection and life, go thy way, call
thy brothers and sisters who, like thee, are in need of help."
   6. " IN view of their human distress, and of the fact that these
afflicted friends could mourn over the dead when the Saviour of
the world stood by, who had power to raise from the dead, Jesus
wept.' His grief was not alone because of the scene before Him.

The weight of the grief of ages was upon His soul, and, looking
down the years that were to come, He saw the suffering and sor-
row, tears and death, that were to be the lot of men. His heart
was pierced with the pain of the human family of all ages and in all
lands. The woes of the sinful race were heavy on His soul, and
the fountain of His tears was broken up, as He longed to relieve
all their distress."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 2, p. 361. He wept
with me and for me.

two great truths emphasized in this lesson are inseparably con-
nected with the person of Christ. So it is with other doctrines.
Compare 1 Cor. I : 3o. Thus have all doctrines become experience
in Christ, that they may be known as experience by us. This is
" the truth as it is in Jesus."

  Z. "ALL God's works are wont to have a small beginning. Be-
hold, He who was about to raise the dead commanded the stone to
be taken away, as if He could not remove it by the same power of
His word, or make the dead look out alive through the stone!
Why, then, does He perform the greater thing, the awakening from
death, whilst He leaves undone the smaller thing, as also afterwards
the loosing of the grave clothes? Now, this is the order in which
He still works His wonders. Daily He nourishes us through His
almighty word, but He encloses the sustaining power in the bread
which we eat. By the word of the Lord the plants and fruit grow,
yet He commands to plow and to sow, to plant and to water."
"His kindness does not permit us to be idle spectators of His
works, but earnest helpers of them. Even in the work of raising

 sinners from spiritual death, He makes use of human hands which
 `take away the stone,' and afterwards 'loose' the grave clothes;
 the act of quickening to life,—this He reserves for Himself; His
•voice must do that."
    2. JESUS had already announced that this sickness was "for the
 glory' of God." The glory of God is His character, what He
 really is, and this is always "revealed from faith to faith." Moses
 desired to see the glory of God (Ex. 33:18), and it was shown to
 him in the revelation of the character of God (Ex. 34:5-7). That
 this glory might be seen by all, Christ, who is the brightness (or
 outshining) of His Father's glory (Heb 1:3), veiled His divinity
 with humanity, and came t ) be the "glory of thy people Israel "
 (Luke 2:32). In His first miracle He "manifested forth His glory"
 (John 2:11), and throughout His ministry He has continued to do
 so. This miracle is the climax. "This demonstration of the
 Power of Christ was the crowning manifestation offered by God to
 man as a proof that He had sent His Son into the world for
 the salvation of the human race."— Spirit of Prophecy; vol. 2,
'P. 366.
    3. EVERY individual will at some time "see the glory of God."
 Those who by "looking unto Jesus" with the eye of faith, see this
 glory "in the face of Jesus Christ" (2 Cor. 4:6), and thus "are
 changed into the same image" (2 Cor. 3:18), will "be conformed
 to the body of His glory" (Phil. 3:21, R. V.), and together with
 "the King of glory" (Ps. 24:7) will enter "that great city, . . .
 having the glory of God, . .        for the glory of God did lighten
 it.' Those who refuse to be hidden in the Rock Christ Jesus (Ex.
33:22) will in that day see the glory of God as a "devouring fire"
 (Ex. 24:17), for such He is to sinners out of Christ (Heb. 12:2 9).
    4. "LAzARus stands before them, not as one emaciated from dis-
 ease, and with feeble, tottering limbs, but as a man in the prime
 of life, and in the vigor of a noble manhood, his eyes beaming
 with intelligence and love for his Saviour. He bows at the feet of
 Jesus and glorifies Him. A dumb surprise at first siezes all pres-
  ent; but now succeeds an inexpressible scene of rejoicing and
  thanksgiving. The sisters receive their brother back to life as the
  gift of God, and with joyful tears, brokenly express their thanks
                   FOR MISSION WORK IN JAPAN.

and praise to the Saviour. But while brother, sisters, and friends
are rejoicing in this reunion, Jesus retires from the exciting scene,
and when they look for the Lifegiver, He is nowhere to be found."
—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 2, pp. 365, 366.
  5. "DEATH gives way before Christ's word of power sooner than
unbelief does." "The Pharisees, who had rejected all lesser evi-
dence, were only enraged at this new miracle of raising the dead
in the full light of day and before a crowd of witnesses."—Id.
A. 36.
  6. "IT is deserving of remark that when, forty years after, Jeru-
salem, stained with the murder of Jesus, fell under the avenging
sword which God gave into the hand of the Romans, those only
escaped destruction who believed in Christ." They did not let
this man alone, and the Romans did come and take away their
place and their nation. Man proposes, but God disposes.
  7. "THE gift of prophecy, which the predecessors of Caiaphas
had formerly exercised through 'the Light and Right'—the Urim
and Thummim (Ex. 28:30)—had been long extinguished, but it
was once more to light up in the high priest of this year, in order
that from Moses' seat, the one true Offering for sin might be set
forth before the eyes of the people. Caiaphas and Pilate con-
demned Jesus, but both were constrained to testify of Him in
words whose meaning went far beyond what they themselves were
aware of."
  8. "JEsus had now given three years of public labor to the
world. His example of self-denial and disinterested benevolence
was before them. . . . Yet this short period of three years
was as long as the world could endure the presence of its Re-
deemer." "They had long sought to kill Him, but from that day
their determination was thenceforward fixed."

              SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.

as this, or to have the record of it in the Scriptures?

   25. What effect did these things have upon the Pharisees?

                              NOTES.
   2. "DRIVEN from Bethlehem by a jealous king, rejected by His
own people at Nazareth, condemned without cause at Jerusalem,
Jesus, with his few faithful followers, finds a temporary asylum in
a strange city."
  2. "ALL who according to the Levitical law were unclean, were
obliged before the Passover to purify themselves (Num. 9:6, 1o)
through the observance of a number of rites appointed for the
purpose."
  3. IN spite of all their efforts to apprehend Jesus and bring Him
to Jerusalem, He comes of His own accord. "That was not
allowed to come to pass which His enemies were planning to
effect, that they should bring Him by force to Jerusalem; instead
of that He was to enter in triumph."
  4. JEsus spent His last Sabbath at Bethany. "Before the next
He would be crucified. And He knew it." "Simon of Bethany,
whom Jesus had healed of leprosy, wishing to show his Master
special honor, made a supper and invited Him and His friends as
guests. The Saviour sat at the table, with Simon, whom He had
cured of a loathsome disease, on one side, and Lazarus, whom He
had raised from the dead, on the other. Martha served at the
table, but Mary was earnestly listening to every word that fell from
the lips of Jesus. . . • . At great personal sacrifice she had pur-

chased an alabaster box of precious ointment with which to anoint
the body of Jesus at His death. But she now heard many express
an opinion that He would be elevated to kingly authority when
He went to Jerusalem, and she was only too ready to believe that
it-would be so. She rejoiced that her Saviour would no longer be
despised and rejected, and obliged to flee for His life. In her love
and gratitude she wished to be the first to do Him honor, and,'
seeking to avoid observation, anointed His head and feet with the
precious ointment." "This alabaster box of ointment had cost as
much as would keep a laboring man's family for a year." "Juda4
boldly expressed his disapprobation at such a wasteful extrava-
gance. . . He had been appointed treasurer of the united funds
of the disciples, and had dishonestly appropriated to himself the
means which were designed for the service of God                 He
longed to have the avails of the expensive ointment in his own
hands to apply to his own selfish purposes."—Spirit of Prophecy,
vole, pp. 375, 376. "The very man who objected to this present
expenditure was making up his mind to sell Him [Jesus] for a
small part of the sum." "How often will a man adopt sancti-
monious phraseology to hide his real self, and will talk of the poor,
and Christ, and religion, not that he cares for any of these things,
 but because he desires to add to his own estate or position!"
   5. JunAs talks of the poor, but "the poor of Bethany would prob-
ably appeal to Mary much more hopefully than to Judas, and they
 would appeal all the more successfully because her heart Wad been
allowed to utter itself thus to Jesus." "Kingdoms would rise, and
 fall; the names of monarchs and conquerors would be forgotten;
 but the memory of this woman's deed would be immortalized upon
 the pages of sacred history." Mark 14:9. The heart of Judas
 "burned with envy that Jesus should be the recipient of an offering
 suitable to the monarchs of earth. He went directly from that
 supper to the chief priests and agreed to betray Him into their
 hands."
   6. "JESUS will remember every good work done by His children.
 The self-sacrificing and benevolent will live in His memory and be
 rewarded. No act of devotion to His cause will be forgotten by
 Him. There is no sacrifice too costly to be offered on the altar of
 our faith."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 2, fi. 383. :`Truly comfort-

  ing for souls which are honest towards God is the word, 'She hath
  done what she could.' . . . Mary had done what she could;
  but in fact, she had done more than she knew."
    7. IN raising Lazarus to life, Jesus exposed both Himself and
  Lazarus to the murderous hate of the Pharisees. It would not do
  to put Jesus to death and leave Lazarus alive. "The very fact
  that a man existed who had been four days in the grave, and whose
  body had begun to decay, yet had been called to life and health
  by a word from Jesus, would sooner or later create a reaction and
  bring disaster upon themselves for sacrificing the life of Him who
  could perform such a miracle for the benefit of humanity." "But
  the chief priests plotted to murder Lazarus as well; because, on
  account of him, many left the Judeans and believed on Jesus."
    8. "THE world had never before seen such a triumphal pro-
- cession. It was not like that of the earth's famous conquerors.
  No train of mourning captives, as trophies of kingly valor, made
  a feature of that imposing pageant. But about the Saviour were
  the glorious trophies of His labors of love for sinful man. There
  were the captives whom He had rescued from Satan's cruel power,
  praising God for their deliverance. The blind to whom He had
  restored sight pressed on, leading the way. The dumb whose
  tongues'e had loosed, shouted the loudest hosannas. The crip-
  ples whom He had healed, bounded freely on, the most active in
  breaking the palm branches and in waving them before the Sav-
  iour. Widows and orphans were among the multitude, exalting
  the name of Jesus for His works of mercy to them. The lepers
  who had been cleansed by a word from Him, and rescued from a
  living death, spread their untainted garments in His path and
  hailed Him as the King of Glory. Those who had been awakened
  by His magic voice from the sleep of death were in that throng.
  Lazarus, whose body had seen corruption in the grave, now re-
  stored to the full strength of glorious manhood, guided the hum-
  ble beast upon which his Liberator rode."—Spirit of Prophecy,
  vol 2, PP. 388, 389.

                               NOTES.
  I. " THE request of the Greeks to see Jesus, brought the future
before Him. . . . He looked forward with joy to the period
when the partition wall between Jew and gentile would be thrown
down, and the broad harvest-field would be the world. .             .
He saw that the gathering of the gentiles was to follow His ap-
proaching death. He therefore presented to His disciples and to
the listening crowd the figure of the wheat, to represent how His
death would be productive of a great harvest. . . . In the
gospel of the death and resurrection of Christ, and the resurrection
of the dead, life and immortality are brought to light, and the
kingdom of heaven is thrown open to all believers."—Spirit of
Prophecy, vol. 3, pp. 71, 75.
   2. "Two points are here suggested: (i) That the life, the living
force that was in Christ, reached its proper value and influence
through His death; and (2) that the proper value of Christ's life is
that it propagates similar lives. . . . Year by year men sacri-
fice their choicest sample of grain, and are content to bury it in
the earth instead of exposing it in the market, because they under-
stand that except it die it abideth alone, but if it die it bringeth
forth much fruit. . . . The law of the seed is the law of human
life. . . . Your life is a seed now, not a developed plant, and
it can become a developed plant only by your taking heart to cast

it from you and sow it in the fertile soil of other men's needs. . . .
To use His own figure, He (Jesus) was as a seed unsown so long
as He lived, valuable in His own proper person; but by dying, His
life obtained the value of seed sown, propagating its kind in ever-
lasting increase. . . . As seed produces grain of its own kind,
so Christ produces men like Christ. . . . Christ, having been
sown, lives now in His people. . . . He gave His life away
for the good of men, and therefore prolongs His days and sees His
seed eternally. . . . Whoever will choose the same destiny
as Christ, must take the same road that He took. . . . Self-
seeking is self-destroying. . . . Every human life is under this
law. There is no path to goodness or to happiness, save this one.
Nature herself teaches us as much."
  3. THERE are many lonely people about the world, who complain
of desolate and solitary lives,       . . and have never learned
that the cure for loneliness comes through the sowing of one's self
in a grave of daily self-sacrifice." "The soul that dares to live
this life, will find streams flowing from every smitten rock; honey
in the carcass of every slain lion. .     . So it must be ever. Day
out of night; spring out of winter; flowers out of frost; joy out of
sorrow; fruitfulness out of pruning; Olivet out of Gethsemane; the
ascension out of Calvary; life out of death; and the Christ that is
to be, out of the pangs of a travailing creation."
  4. " THE voice of God had been heard at the baptism of Jesus,
at the commencement of His ministry, and again at His transfigur-
ation on the mount;. and now, at the close of His ministry, it was
heard for the third time, and on this occasion by a larger number
of persons and under peculiar circumstances. He had just uttered
the most solemn truths concerning the condition of the Jews. He
had made His last appeal, and pronounced their doom-. The wall
of partition between Jew and gentile was tottering, and ready to
fall at the death of Christ."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3,p. 79.
  5. " IN the act of Christ dying for the salvation of man, heaven
was not only made accessible to man, but God and His Son were
justified before all heaven in dealing with the rebellion of Satan,
and in his expulsion. The blot which Satan had placed upon
                   FOR MISSION WORK IN JAPAN.

heaven itself was thus to be washed away; and no sin could ever-
more enter there to all eternity. The holy angels, and all created
intelligences of the worlds where sin had not entered, responded in
hallelujahs to the judicial sentence pronounced upon Satan, ap-
plauding the act of Christ which removed the mortgage Satan held
upon the souls of men. The holy angels, as well as those who are
washed by the blood of Christ, are drawn to Him by this crowning
act of giving His life for the sins of the world. Christ, in being
lifted up upon the cross to die, opened the way of life to both Jews
and gentiles, to all nations, tongues, and people."—Spirit of
Prophecy, vol. 3, 0. 8o, 8z.
  6. "THE course of the Jewish people, so highly favored and so
deeply fallen, should engrave upon the heart of us, the Christian
Israel, with letters of fire, the words, ' Walk while ye have the light
lest darkness come upon you,' that we may take heed, with fear
and trembling, to every spark of light which the word of God
essays to cast into our hearts."
  7. "THE period of great spiritual light, if that light is not
sacredly cherished and acted upon, will be turned into a time of
corresponding spiritual darkness." " Delay is the ordinary ex-
pression of antagonism to Christ; infidelity the extraordinary."

        RESULTS OF CHRIST'S FIANIFESTATION.
                       (Chapter is,   verses 37-50.)

                            QUESTIONS.
    1. How did the Jews respond to the works of Christ?
    2. With what was this result in harmony?

                               NOTES.
  I. "THERE 1S a terrible danger—a danger not sufficiently under-
stood—in delaying to yield to the pleading voice of God's Holy
Spirit, in choosing to live in sin; for such this delay really is. .
. . Many are quieting a troubled conscience with the thought
that they can change a course of evil when they choose; that they
can trifle with the invitations of mercy, and yet be again and
again impressed. They think that . . . in a moment of ter-
                  FOR MISSION WORK IN JAPAN.
30                    THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

 rible extremity they can change their course. But this is not so
easily done. The experience, the education, of a lifetime, has so
thoroughly molded the character that few then desire to receive
the image of Jesus."
   2. "IT is not the plan of God to compel men to yield their wicked
unbelief. Before them are light and darkness, truth and error. It
is for them to decide which to accept. The human mind is en-,
dowed with power to discriminate between right and wrong.
God designs that men shall not decide from impulse, but from
weight of evidence, carefully comparing scripture with scripture.
Had the Jews laid by their prejudice, and compared written proph-
ecy with the facts characterizing the life of Jesus, they would have
perceived a beautiful harmony between the prophecies and their
fulfilment in the life and ministry of the lowly Galilean."
   3. "THESE things said Isaiah, because he saw His glory." R. V.
The wonderful view granted to Isaiah was but a foreshadowing
of the outshining of His glory (Heb. i : 3) as it would be revealed
in Christ, and the prophet saw that such an exhibition of the glory
of the Lord would simply blind the eyes of those who had persist-
ently refused to receive the light as it was gradually revealed, and
as they were able to bear it. One who persists in living in a dark
cave is blinded when a bright light suddenly breaks upon his
vision.
   4. MEN of influence were convinced that Christ's claims and
teaching were true, but refrained from acknowledging them and
Him for fear of losing their standing in society and the church;
"for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God."
R. V. The glory of fellowship with God was quite eclipsed by
the glory of living in the eye of the people as wise and estimable
persons.

                              NOTES.
   I. THE record of the manifestation of Jesus to the world and
its results has been completed. We now come to the closing
scenes of His earthly life. In this and the three chapters next fol-
lowing we have His last lessons to His disciples. "This indeed
was the last evening of His life. Within twenty-four hoursTle was
to be in the tomb." "This was virtually the last Passover that was
ever to be celebrated; for type was to meet antitype in the slaying
of the Lamb of God for the sins of the world." "It was in accord-
ance with His true human nature that the love He bore his disci-
ples should be felt at its intensest just now, when He was about to
leave them."
   2. To BETRAY Jesus "was not the first thing that Satan had put
into the heart of Judas. Satan does not begin by putting in such
monstrous thoughts as these. . . . Anything that is in the
heart is the heart's own, and could not at all be there if the heart
had not consented. . . . So it is with the sinful volitions of
men at the present day. They choose to do evil; they are not
made to do it."
   3. JESUS was conscious of His own true dignity and greatness.
"It was not in forgetfulness of his divine origin, but in full con-
sciousness of it that He discharged this menial function. . . .
Not only does the dignity of Jesus vastly augment the dignity of
the action, but it sheds new light on the divine character." "We
shall never have any proper conception of what true dignity is until
we understand that love is upon the throne of the universe. He
that sitteth upon the throne came into the world and washed the
feet of those Galilean fishermen, that believers might be blissfully
aware that love is wedded to Omnipotence." "He into Whose

hands the Mather had given all things, with those same hands
washes, not the hands, but the feet of His disciples."
   4. "A CONTENTION had arisen among the disciples of Jesus as to
who should be the most honored in His kingdom; for notwith-
standing the express instruction they had so often received to the
contrary, they had clung to the idea that Jesus would establish a
temporal kingdom in Jerusalem; and the late demonstrations upon
His entering the city, and the manner in which He had received
them, revived this belief in their minds. Jesus had checked their
aspirations for honor, and now strengthened the lesson by an act
of humility and love, calculated to impress them with a sense of
their obligations to one another, and that instead of quarreling for
place, each should count the others better than himself."—Spirit
of Prophecy, vol. 3, pp. 81, 85. "In self-love, self-exaltation,
and pride, there is great weakness; but in humility there is great
strength. Our true dignity is not maintained when we think most
Of ourselves, but when God is in all our thoughts, and our hearts
are all aglow with the love of our Redeemer and love to our fellow
men. Simplicity of character and lowliness of heart will give hap-
piness, while self-conceit will bring discontent, repining, and con-
tinual disappointment. It is learning to think less of ourselves
and more of making others happy that will bring to us divine
strength."
   5. WHEN the way seems dark to the believer, and the providences
of God are utterly incomprehensible to him, he may remember the
gracious promise, " What I do thou knowest not now; but thou
shalt know hereafter."
   6. No ORDINANCE of the Lord's house has been more clearly es-
tablished or more explicitly enjoined than feet-washing. The same
course of reasoning which makes all this a mere parable, will set
aside the use of the bread and the wine, and in fact any institution
of the church to which one does not wish to submit himself, no
matter how plainly it is commanded in the Scripture. Those who
exalt tradition above the plain word of God, are not slow to point
out the inconsistency of those who claim to follow the Bible and
the Bible alone, and who do yet practice infant baptism, for which
 there is no command whatever, and omit feet-washing, which is
among the plainest of commands. Thus has the cause of true

 Protestantism been hindered. The explanation of all this is found
 in the pride of the human heart.
    7. " HAPPINESS consists, not in knowing, but in doing.      . .
 Be content to be as your Master, and your Master will not be con-
 tent without making you as He is. There is a woe where there is
 knowledge unaccompanied by obedience. . . . The knowledge
 that leads to action is blessed." " Let us look upon every Chris-
 tian as one with whom Christ is identified, an ambassador in whom
 Christ is in a certain sense present with us."
                 SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.
   1. FOR what purpose did the Father give all things into the
 hands of Christ? When will that purpose he fully accomplished?
 Compare r Cor. 8 : 6; 15 : 24-28.
   2. The word "Master," in verse 13, is used in the sense of
 Teacher. See Revised Version, margin. What was He teaching
 now? What are some of the characteristics of Jesus as "the
 Teacher "?
   3. The spirit which now casts aside this plain instruction of the
 Teacher, is the same as He met in His teaching. See Matt. 15: 1-9.
   4. That the practice of literal feet-washing was followed in the
 early church, is suggested by I Tim. 5 : 10.
   5. To wash the feet of equals is regarded as an act of humility,
-but Christ took the place of a servant of His own servants. Com-
 pare Phil. 2: 7 and r Sam. 25 :41; Matt. 20: 27, 28, etc.
   6. What is the general teaching and purpose of the ordinance of
 humility? Has the promise of verse 17 been fulfilled in your case?

                                NOTES.
   I. "As THE disciples sat at the Passover with their beloved Mas-
ter, they observed that He still appeared greatly troubled and de-
pressed. A cloud settled over them all, a premonition of some
dreadful calamity, the character of which they did not understand.
As they ate in silence, Jesus said, Verily, I say unto you that one
of you shall betray Me.' " " He says, `One of you.' Rather will
He frighten all, than that the one should lose this last impulse to
repentance." "There was a touching forbearance manifested in
the dealing of Jesus with Judas. It evinced an infinite mercy, giv-
ing him one more chance of repentance, by showing hitit that all
his thoughts and purposes were fully known to the Son of God.
. . . But Judas, although surprised and alarmed, was not moved
to repentance."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3, pp. 85, 86.
   2. "THE fashion of the world is to love the treachery, and to
                  FOR MISSION WORK IN JAPAN.
36                     THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

hate the traitor. But Christ reverses this—He abhors the treach-
ery, whilst He seeks to save the traitor's soul, because it is dear to
Him." "Not even John knew who it was of whom Jesus spake,
so reticent had been the love of this most faithful Shepherd of
souls so long as a single hope of life yet remained on behalf of
this son of perdition ! " "John had a right to speak of himself as
the disciple whom Jesus loved. So have I, so have you."
  3. ACCORDING to the rendering of the Revised Version, Peter
said to John: " Tell us who it is of whom He speaketh; " and
John, not knowing himself; asked Jesus; "and He who of old time
had not been able to hide from Abraham His secrets, because
Abraham was His friend " (Gen. 18 : 17), reveals this matter to His
beloved disciple. Judas "had been deliberately, step by step,
opening his heart to Satan, until now at length he had become
wholly of one mind with the arch-enemy of Jesus Christ. . . .
This, Satan entered into him,' is the exact opposite of what the
children of God experience when the Father and the Son come
and, in the Holy Ghost, take up Their abode within them."
  4. " THE word of God favors the opinion that every heart is
potentially deceitful and wicked to this degree, that there are
germs of iniquity in every heart, that need only a suitable train
and combination of circumstances to fructify into just such marvels
of malevolence as we find in Judas."
  5. "WHEN Jesus saw that Judas and Satan could now no longer
be separated, He gave him 70, and drove him speeding into the
darkness: Depart, then, I will no longer detain thee. It is like
that last word which Moses spake to Pharaoh in Ex. 10 : 29."
Compare also Matt. 25:41.
  6. "HAD Jesus remained silent, in apparent ignorance of that
which was to come upon Him, an impression might have been
left on the minds of His disciples that their Master had not divine •
foresight, and had been deceived, surprised, and betrayed into the
hands of a murderous mob. A year before, Jesus had told the
disciples that He had chosen twelve, but that one was a devil; and
now His words to Judas on the occasion of the Passover, showing
that his treachery was fully known to his Master, would strengthen

the faith of His true followers during His humiliation."—Spirit of
Prophecy, vol. 3, is. 87.
  7. "SOME thought that he (Judas) should buy something for the
feast. Ah, they little knew what a sacrifice that was which, through
the hand of Judas, was to be purchased for this feast. Judas, how-
ever, had understood; hating received the sop, he went immedi-
ately out—and it was night; night also in the heart of this son of
perdition; for no ray of grace from Jesus' face could any longer
penetrate there. And soon 'the power of darkness' rushed in
(Luke 22:53)."
  S. "THERE comes a point in the downward course of the wicked,
at which they are given over to a reprobate mind. In other words,
Satan, who has been by degrees encroaching upon their souls, at
last succeeds in establishing his empire within them, and they be-
come his. Then they separate themselves from the company of
the godly.. They excommunicate themselves. They go to their
own place. Like Judas, they step out of the light of the cham-
ber where Jesus is, into the outside darkness."
  9. "MEN still profess to he Christians who are so only in the degree
in which Judas was. They expect some good from Christ but not
all. . . . They retain command of their own life, and are pre-
pared to go with Christ only so far as they find it agreeable or in-
viting. . . . They are seeking to use Christ, and are not will-
ing to be used by Him. They are 'not wholly and heartily His,
but merely seek to derive some influence from Him. The result
is they one day find that, through all their religious profession
and apparent Christian lite, their characteristic sin has actually
been gaining strength. . . . They find that the reward of
double-mindedness is the most absolute perdition; that :both Christ
and the world, to be made anything of, require the whole man,
and that he who tries to get the good of both gets the good of
neither."
  10. "THE withdrawal of Judas was a relief to all present. The
Saviour's face lighted immediately, and the oppressive shadow
was lifted from the disciples as they saw the peace of heaven re-
turn to the pale, worn countenance of their Lord." -
                    FOR MISSION WORK IN JAPAN.
38                     THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

  11. "IN the command of the New Testament, 'Love one another,
as Christ also hath loved you,' the command of the Old Testa-
ment, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,' appears again in
a new and restored form." "I have given you the commandment;
I will give you the heart to obey it." Eph. 5: 2 ; Eze. 36:26, 27.
"Those who cherished a common love to Him were drawn to one
another more closely than even to blood-relations."
  12. A PICTURE of self-confidence and its result is presented in
the dialogue between Jesus and Peter. "Satan has a quiver full of
poisoned arrows. Knowestthou which of them is the most deadly?
—It is trust and confidence towards thyself. See to it that he does
not wound thee thereby; for in the wound will grow the proud
flesh of security; and that afterwards festers into what?—Pre-
sumption."

                             NOTES.
  I. THE instruction given to His disciples by Jesus on that last
night before His crucifixion has been the comfort of believeis in
all ages. He began with, "Let not your heart he troubled," and
the discourse "flows on in one channel of love, and ends at last
with the word, 'Be of good cheer.' " We are to be of good cheer
while in the world, because He has overcome it, and we are not to
be troubled, for He is coming again.
  2. "OF what coming again does the Lord'here speak?—The same
of which He spoke in Matt. 24:30-31, His glorious return at the
last day to 'gather His elect/ Acts mt. Visibly He departs,
visibly will He return; and there He will receive His people to
Himself into His heavenly kingdom." The comfort which Jesus
offers to the believer is not, "You will soon die and come to me,"

but, ''I will come again." "One of the most solemn and yet most
glorious truths revealed in the Bible is that of Christ's second
coming, to complete the great work of redemption. . . . The
doctrine of the second advent is the very key-note of the Sacred
Scriptures. From the day when the first pair turned their sorrow-
ing steps from Eden, the children of faith have waited the coming
of the Promised One to break the destroyer's power and bring them
again to the lost Paradise. . . . About His coming cluster the
glories of that 'restitution of all things, which God bath spoken by
the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began.' Then
the long-continued rule of evil shall be broken; 'the kingdoms of
this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ;
and He shall reign forever and ever.' It is then that the peaceful
and long-desired kingdom of the Messiah shall be established
under the whole heaven." "The more of heaven we have here
below, through flab outpouring of the Spirit, the more rapturous
become our anticipations of the glory that is to come."
   3. " JEsus says: ' I am the way, the truth, and the life.' I am
that ladder which Jacob saw, the base of it resting firmly upon the
earth, while the topmost round reaches to the throne of God. I
am the light that shines upon every soul who climbs up by Me. I
am the life, inspiring with faith and love as you move onward and
upward.' All truth is found in Christ. . . . Only by presenting
the truth as it is in Jesus, will our work be effectual in reaching
the hearts of men."
   4. " AM the way.' It is not a cold, dead road we have to
make the most of for ourselves, pursuing it often in darkness, in
weakness, in fear. It is a living way—a way that renews our
strength as we walk in it, that enlivens instead of exhausting us,
that gives direction and light as we go forward. . . . Wherever
you are, at whatever point of experience, at whatever stage of sin,
this way begins where you are, and you have but to take it and it
leads to God. . . . From your person, as you are at this
moment, there leads a way to the Father." " Just where the sinner
is, in that very quagmire, begins the way. Not a single step
heavenward can he take until he depends on Christ."
  5. " IN Christ we behold God. . . . In Christ blessing little

children; joining in the harmless gaiety of the Cana wedding-feast;
mourning over Lazarus; allowing the penitent woman to touch_
Him; showing gentleness, courtesy, consideration, tenderness, to-
everybody,—we have the manifestation of the unseen Jehovah.
Such as Christ is, such is God."
   6. " OUR Saviour said, Greater works than these shall ye do;
because I go unto My Father.' What are these greater works'?.
If our lips are touched with the living coal from off the altar, we
shall reveal to the world the wonderful love manifested by God in
giving Jesus, His only-begotten Son, to the world, that whosoever
believeth on Him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
After the crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus, the-
disciples "saw that the prophecies had been literally fulfilled.
They could search the Scriptures and accept their teachings with a.
faith and assurance which they had never known before. The-
divine Teacher was indeed all that He claimed to be. The proph—
ecies relating to Christ and His mission were no longer a mystery
to His disciples, but a living reality; and as they told their experi-
ence to the world, as they exalted the love of God, the divine-
assurance which they manifested was an evidence to men that they
had received the gift of the Holy Ghost. Men's hearts were melted'
and subdued. The promise, Greater works than these shall ye-
do; because I go unto My Father,' was fulfilled."


               SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.
  i. JusT now Christ is preparing a people for the place which He-
has prepared for them. Are we ready for our place?
  2. The third verse brings up the whole question of Christ's sec-
ond coming. This opens an almost boundless field for study.
Note especially i Thess. 4 : 16 to 5 : 6.
  3. The central thought of heaven is to be with Christ. Why-
would a sinner be unhappy in heaven?
  4. Study verse to as revealing the innermost principle of the-
Christian life : "The Father abiding in Me doeth His works.":
Revised Version.
  5. How is life only in Christ taught in this lesson?

  23. How much further instruction did He propose to give them?,
 Why?
  24. What was the basis of His conduct?
  25. With what words did Jesus close this lesson?

                                 NOTES.
    I. " IN His farewell discourse, He (Jesus) time after time spoke
 of obedience to His commands as the one condition of all further
 spiritual blessing. . . . While the freedom of grace and the
 simplicity of faith have been preached, the absolute necessity of
 obedience and holiness has not been equally insisted on. . . .
 The obedient must and may look for the fulness of the Spirit.
     . . A living obedience is indispensable to the full experience
 of the indwelling; the full experience of the indwelling is what a
 loving obedience may certainly claim. . . . It is only when
 God's will has been accepted as our only law, and the commands
 of Jesus are by the Holy Spirit written in the heart, that the glory
 of God can fill His temple."
    2. " `I LIVE,' the Lord says; not, 'I shall live,' but now, at the
 present time, 'I live'; for He is indeed life, He is the Living One
 (Rev. 1: 18, R. V.); and, therefore, because He is life, as a neces-
 sary consequence He swallowed up death in victory by rising from
 the dead. But in respect to believers, He says, 'Ye shall live,' be-
  cause their life grows not out of themselves, but as the fruit out of
  Christ's life."
    3. "THE love of the Lord Jesus Christ is expressed in His com-
  mandments as well as in His promises and invitations. To believe
  in the Lord Jesus Christ is to believe that His commandments are
  expressive of his love. . . . As often as you shut your eyes in
  presence of a command of the Saviour, you shut your eyes to an'
  exquisite gift sent down to you from the Father of mercies."
_ 4. "IF our hearts are renewed in the likeness of God, if the divine
  love is implanted in the soul,will not the law of God be carried out in
  the life? When the principle of love is implanted in the heart,
  when man is renewed after the image of Him that created him,
  the new covenant promise is fulfilled, 'I will put My laws into
  their hearts, and in their minds will I write them.' And if the

 law is written in the heart, will it not shape the life? Obedience—
 the service and allegiance of love—is the true sign of discipleship."
   5. "'WE will come unto him.' What wonderful visitation! It
 had been dimly anticipated in former times (Ps. 8:4); but now it
 was to be the free and full privilege of all that would receive it
 (Rev. 3: zo). Some indeed could not receive God, nor could they
even behold or know Him; from them God and Christ alike were
hidden, because sin had blinded their eyes (John 12: 40; 2 Cor. 4:4).
But to the contrite in spirit, God will look (Isa. 66 : 2); to the hum-
ble He will draw nigh (James 4 : 6, 8). 'And make Our abode with
him;' not as coming for a temporary sojourn, but to be with us 'for-
ever.' And that our heart should be God's home—surely this
means unutterable love of God to us, and our unspeakable joy in
God! For it means most intimate communing, even the sharing
of His life. He that inhabits eternity is the willing inmate of the
lowly soul. Isa. 57: 15."
   6. "THE Holy Ghost was to teach them all things, by bringing
to their remembrance all things which they had heard from their
Lord." The Holy Spirit is the memory of "the new man." This
is the true secret of remembering the right scripture at the right
time. "Only those who have the love and the longing for good-
ness will be wise scholars in Christ's school."
   7. "THE peace which Christ desires His disciples to enjoy is
that which characterized Himself. . . . By calling it specifi-
cally My peace,' our Lord distinguishes it from the peace which
men ordinarily pursue. . . . The peace of which Christ here
speaks may be called His, as being wrought out by Him, and as
being only attainable by others through His communication of it to
them. . . . Peace amidst all the ills of life can only be attained
by a real for.owing of Christ and a hearty and profound acceptance
of his principles and Spirit.
   8. "To FEAR 1S to have more faith in your antagonist than in
Christ. When you have found one greater than Christ, then you
may fear."
   9. "SATAN had nothing in Christ. Look into thy heart, 0 man,
and see what Satan has there."
   10. "WHAT Christ rejoiced to do, believers should also make

haste to do. They should aim to give full proof to the world that
they love the Father and keep His commandments."

                SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY.
    r. The word "Comforter" in this lesson is translated "Advo-
cate" in the matin of the R. V. Compare I John 2: 1. In what
sense is the Holy Spirit "another Comforter" or Advocate?
    2. In proportion as the church loses the power to see the invis-
ible, it demands visible representations and representatives of in-
visible things and persons. Compare the history of the great
apostasy.
   3. Study in this lesson the true doctrine of the Real Presence.
    4. What hinders the prayer of Christ from being answered just
as fully in our day as at Pentecost?
    5. Compare the ability of the world to see and appreciate Christ
with the ability of the Christian. What makes the difference?
    6. What is the one fundamental cause of the weakness of the
present day religion? What will be the only remedy?
    7. What things only can the Holy Spirit bring to our remem-
brance? How does this emphasize the importance of Bible study?
    S. With verse 21 compare Rom. 13: ro; I John 5 : 3, etc.
    9. How is life only in Christ taught in this lesson?



       LESSON XI11.—(larch 27, 1897.
                     A REVIEW LESSON.

  I. READ carefully the five chapters which have been studied
during the present quarter, and make a brief written outline in
your own words of the leading topics in each chapter.
  2. Observe that Christ is presented in these lessons as:—
     (a) The Good Shepherd.
     (b) The Son of God.
     (c) The Resurrection.
     (d) The Life.
                   FOR MISSION WORK IN JAPAN.
46                    THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

     (e)    The King of Israel.
     ( f ) The   Light of the world.
      (g) The Servant of servants.
      (h) The Way.
      (i) The Truth.
      (j) The Comforter (through the Holy Spirit).
   3. Study the following great truths as taught in these lessons:—
      (a) The tender care of Jesus for His children.
      (b) The universal character of the gospel message.
      (c) Christ the only Lifegiver.
      (d) The true character of Christ's kingdom.
      (e) Life through death; the law both for Christ and His
            followers.
      ( f ) The cross of Christ the safety of the universe.
      (g) The real cause of blindness and hardness.
      (h) A neglected ordinance and the blessing of observing it.
      (i) The true evidence of discipleship.
      (j) The personal second advent.
      (k) God in Christ.
      (/) The Holy Spirit Christ's representative.
      (m)Love shows itself in obedience.
      (n) True peace for believers.
   4. In these chapters Christ finishes His work and His teaching
among His enemies, and begins His last teaching in the inner circle
of His immediate friends. Note the contrast between the triumphal
entry and the washing of the disciples' feet. Are the same princi-
ples of His character revealed in both instances?
   5. Count the number of places and note the different ways in
which life through Christ is taught in these chapters. This gospel
is indeed the gospel of life. •
   6. Would it not be profitable for each one to consider whether
he has received personal benefit from the study of these lessons?
A clearer knowledge of Christ, and as a consequence, advance-
ment in the Christian life, should be the object of all Bible study.
Has this been realized?

                                NOTE.
   THE object of this review lesson is to present before the mind a
comprehensive view of the lessons studied during the past quarter,
and to fix more definitely some of the leading thoughts. The out-
line given above is merely a suggestive one, and each student may
feel at liberty to vary it as he thinks best. If a week of indepen-
dent personal study should be put upon these five chapters, and
then different ones should state briefly the results of their study, it
might prove to be a very profitable review. If faithful study has
been given to the lessons during the quarter, this review lesson will
not be a taxing one. It will be found helpful to read and re-read
the chapters several times during the week, and to make the lesson
the subject of daily meditation.
