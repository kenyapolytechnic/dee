      PROGRAM FOR FAMILY STUDY OF S. S. LESSONS.
    SABBATH.—(After church services or at the close of Sabbath.) Review
the lesson of the day by relating in detail the substance of the lesson, or re-
peating the lesson scripture. Read the lesson for the intermediate division
for next Sabbath from the Little Friend, and learn the memory verse.
   SUNDAY.—Study the first half of the lesson in the following manner:
    s. Assign a verse to each member of the family.
    2. Then read the lesson scripture, carefully considering what each verse
says before reading the next. Be sure to have each member of the family
understand the meaning of all the words in each verse.
   3. Select two verses to be committed to memory during the day.
   4. Repeat the memory verse.
   MONDAY.—Review the portion of the lesson already studied.
    i. Give each an opportunity to repeat the two verses that were to be
committed to memory the previous day.
   2. Let one ask the questions from the LESSON QUARTERLY, and others
answer in turn in the words of the Scripture.
   3. Study the last half of the lesson in the same manner that the first
half was studied on Sunday.
   TUESDAY.—Repeat the verses already committed to memory, and ask
the questions on the last half of the lesson, being sure that all understand
the questions and the meaning of the words used in them.
   Select two more verses to be committed to memory during the day.
   WEDNESDAY.—Repeat the verses committed to memory, and review
the entire lesson by asking the questions in the LESSON QUARTERLY, the
Instructor, or the Little Friend, as may be thought best. The number and
age of the children would usually indicate, which would be best.
   THURSDAY.—Read the lesson notes in the QUARTERLY and those in
the Sabbath School Worker, and any other helps that may be accessible, and
review the intermediate lesson in the Little Friend, or the one found in the
LESSON QUARTERLY. Repeat the verses committed to memory.
   FRIDAY.—Thoroughly review the entire lesson in the following manner:
    I. Ask the questions as found in the LESSON QUARTERLY.
   2. Call upon different ones to give a synopsis of the lesson or the lesson
story in their own language.
   3. Let each one repeat as much of the lesson scripture as possible.
   4. Give each one the privilege of questioning others upon the lesson.
   SABBATH —Review practical truths of the lesson, and relate personal
experiences in which the truths of the lesson have been found helpful.

    (This program is simply suggestive and can of course be varied to suit circumstances,
but we do urge upon all the necessity of thorough, regular, systematic study of the Scriptures
as given in our Sabbath-school lessons.)

                  SENIOR CLASSES

                       2d QUARTER,   1897


          LESSON 1.-April 3, 1897.
                   ABIDING IN CHRIST.
                     (Chapter r5, verses

                     Introductory Note.
  AT_the Passover supper Jesus gave the instruction found in
chapters 13 and 14. Then Jesus said, "Arise, let Its go hence"
(John 14 : 35), and He and His disciples left the upper chamber,
and crossed the brook Cedron toward the Garden of Gethsem-
ane, which lies at the foot of the Mount of Olives. While on
their way the instruction found in chapters 15 and 16 was given,
and the Saviour's prayer, as recorded in chapter 17, was offered.
See chapter 18, verse r.
                           QUESTIONS.
   I. WHAT does Christ declare Himself to be?
   2. What is the Father?
   3. What is done with the fruitless branch?
                                                    (3)
4                    THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

    4. What is done to the fruit-bearing branch? For what pur-
pose?
    5. What was said of the condition of the disciples?
    6. How is union with Christ urged?
    7. On what condition only is a branch fruitful? What appli-
cation is made of this fact in nature?
    8. Under what figure is union with Christ taught?.
    9. What is the condition of fruitfulness for the disciple? Why
is union with Christ necessary?
   so. What is done to the one who does not abide in Christ?
What is done to these withered branches?
   IL What promise is based upon union with Christ?
   12. How is God glorified? Of what is such an experience
the evidence?
   13. What is the measure of Christ's love to man? What ex-
hortation is based upon this statement?
   14. What is the experience of abiding in Christ's love? How
is this experience illustrated to us?
   15. What is the first purpose in giving this instruction? The
second?

                             NOTES.
    I. THE following extract shows the circumstances under which
the Saviour gave the instruction contained in this lesson:—
   " Jesus now repaired with His disciples to the Garden of Geth-
semane, at the foot of Mount Olivet, a retired place, which He
had often visited for seasons of communion with His Father.
It was night; but the moon was shining bright, and revealed to
Him a flourishing grapevine. Drawing the attention of the dis-
ciples to it, He said, ' I am the true vine, and my Father is the
husbandman.' "—Spirit' of Prophecy, vol. 3, pp. 89, go.
   Palestine abounded in vineyards, and the Jews were familiar
with the facts which formed the basis of the Saviour's illustra-
tion. In the Old Testament scriptures, God's people had often
been compared to a vineyard. See Ps. 8o : 8-16; Isa. 5 : 1--7;
Jer. 2 : 21.

   2. " PURGETH" here means " pruneth " or " cleanseth," and
is rendered " cleanseth " in the Revised Version. So the Sav-
iour says of his disciples, who are compared to branches in
verse 5, "Now ye are clean through the word which I have
spoken unto you." Verse 3. It means the taking away of
worthless and unprofitable portions.
   3. "THEY are burned." As the branches which are separated
from the vine wither and die, and are cast into the fire and
burned, so those who are'separated from Christ become lifeless
branches, and are burned up, root and branch. Mal. 4 : I. In
the parable of the wheat and tares, recorded in Matt. 13 : 24-30,
the Saviour compared the wicked to tares, and in explanation
of the parable He declares that the tares will be gathered and
burned in the fire (see verses 38-40). And it is a remarkable
fact that in every instance in the Scriptures where the fate of the
wicked is mentioned, and a comparison is used, they are always
compared to the most perishable or combustible materials, and
they are never compared to imperishable or enduring substances
that withstand the action of the elements and the ravages of
time. See Ps. 37:20; Isa. 1:28-31; Jo : 16-18; Nahum 1 : 9, to;
 Matt. 3 : 12; 13 : 47, 48; I Cor. 3 : 122 13.
   4. "ABIDE in Me." This means a constant union with Christ,
the True Vine, by living faith and entire submission of the will
to God. When we thus abide in Christ, we shall only will to
ask according to His will, and then we may be sure that the
 promise, " It shall be done unto you," will be fulfilled. This
 was Christ's experience in His relation to the Father. His will
 was wholly submitted to God's will, and His prayers were
 always heard. John II : 41, 42.

                    SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.
  I. CAN a branch that has just been severed from the vine be
distinguished from the other branches by its appearance?
  2. Are branches that are severed from the stock the only fruit-
less ones? Compare Matt. 21 : 19, zo. What is the lesson?

6                   THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

  3. Name a few plants, trees, etc., which live and bear fruit
exclusively for themselves. How about the human tree—the
"planting of the Lord "?
  4. What is Christ's joy?



         LESSON 11.-April 10, 1897.
PRIVILEGES AND EXPERIENCES CONNECTED WITH
             ABIDING IN CHRIST.
                    (Chapter 15, verses 12-27.)

                          QUESTIONS.
    I. WHAT commandment did Christ give? What example
interprets this commandment?
   2. What is the highest exhibition of love among men?
   3. Who are the friends of Christ?
   4. In what way does Christ no longer speak of His followers?
Why?
   5. What name does He use in speaking of them? Why this
change?
   6. Through what process do men become the disciples of
Christ? To what experience are they appointed? With what
purpose in view?
   7. What commandment is now repeated?
   8. What may encourage those whom the world hates?
   9. What experience would secure the love of the world?
Why are the followers of Christ hated by the world?
  1o. What previous statement is now to be recalled? What
experiences will the disciple share with his Master?
  Ir. What is the real reason for such treatment of believers?
  12. What would have left the world free from the guilt of sin?
How is it now?
  13. How closely is Christ identified with the Father?

                     THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.                          7

  14. How was the guilt of sin brought upon the worla? Whom
has the world hated?
  15. What scripture has thus been fulfilled?
  16. What is the work of the Comforter? From whom does
He come? What is He called?
  17. Who will be associated in the same work? What fits
them for it?

                              NOTES.
   I. "THEY will keep yours also." Those who are acquainted
with the Lord's sayings (the Word of God), and keep them, will
always have ears to hear His servants, and hearts to keep their
sayings. Those who know the voice of the Good Shepherd
will be able to distinguish between the voice of the false and
true under shepherds, not only because they are acquainted with
God's Word, but because they are so fully acquainted with the
Spirit of God in their own experience. They will not believe
every spirit, but they will try the spirits (1 John 4 : I), and thus
be able to discern who are the servants of God, and who are
the "false apostles, deceitful workers" (2 Cor.              13-15).
Thus those who keep Christ's sayings will keep the sayings of
His true servants.
  2. "THEY had not had sin." An important truth is taught
in verse 22. Jesus said, " If I had not come and spoken unto
them, they had not had sin." That is, their guilt was propor-
tionate to the light given them. This was notpnly true of the
Jews then, but it has always been true of all classes, and it is
true to-day. It is a truth of general application. The light we
have determines our responsibility. Christ did not mean that
the people would be sinless if He had not come with greater
light, but that with the greater light they would be left without
excuse for sin. The law entered—was spoken—that the offense
might abound (Rom. 5 : 2o), and that sin by the commandment
might become exceeding sinful (Rom. 7 : 13). The Lord gives
light and instruction, not to increase our guilt, but that we may

8                   THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

sense our guilt, and thus be led to accept Christ and receive His
abounding grace. See Gal. 3 : 24; Rom. 5 : zo. Those who sin
without law—without light and instruction—shall also perish
without law. Rom. : 12. Christ came to give light, not to
condemn the world, but to save the world. John 3: 16, 17.
Without light and salvation through Christ all would perish
(Acts 4 : 12); for all have sinned (Rom. 3 : 10, 23; 5 : 12, 21).
  3. "FROM the beginning." That is, from the commencement
of His public work. Luke uses the same expression (Luke I : 2),
and refers to the same time in verse 3, when he says " from the
very first," and in Acts 1 : 21, 22. Paul also mentions it, using
the expression "at the first" (Heb. 2 : 3).

                     SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.
  I. WHEN did Christ give His life for man? See Rev. 13: 8.
What was the nature of the life which He gave?
  2. What is meant by the expression in verse 16, "and that
your fruit should remain"?
  3. Why are God's people persecuted? Is it because they are
good, or is it because their persecutors are bad? Verses 18, 19,
21, 25, and John 16 : 3.



        LESSON 111.-April 17, 1897.
PERSECUTION AND ITS CAUSE; THE COMING OF THE
         COMFORTER AND HIS WORK.
                     (Chapter i6, verses 1-16.)

                          QUESTIONS.
   I. WHAT was the purpose of the instruction already given?
   2. What is said of excommunication?
   3. Under what claim would the bitterest persecution be car-
ried forward?

    4. Why would such things be possible?
    5. Why were these things now explained? Why was it not
necessary to speak of them sooner?
    6. What important event in Christ's experience was just at
hand? What statement does He make with reference to it?
    7. What experience had Christ's instruction produced?
   8. What fact did He then state? What reason did He give
for this? What promise did He then make?
    9. On what counts will the Comforter secure the conviction
of the world?
  io. Why of sin? \Of righteousness? Of judgment?
       Had Christ imparted all the instruction which He had to
give? Why did He not proceed?
  12. What would be the work of the Holy Spirit? How would
He speak? What would He speak? What will He show, or de-
clare?
  13. Whom will the Spirit glorify? How will this be done?
  14. How much do the Father and the Son have in common?
What statement does this explain?
  15. How is the departure of Christ now mentioned? But
what would still be true in "a little while "? Why?
                             NOTES.
  I. "THAT we should not be offended." " Offended " here
means caused to stumble, the same as in Matt. it : 6; 18 : 6-9;
26: 31, and many other New Testament passages. It does not
mean angry, as we might be led to conclude from the use and
meaning of the word in our day.
  2. "IT is expedient for you that I go away." It would be
better for God's people for Christ to go away, and send them
the Comforter, because Christ could only be present in person
in one place at the same time, whereas the Comforter could be
present everywhere at all times, to convict, convert, and sanctify
the people. Hence, in order to have the gospel do its work in
every part of the world it was necessary for Jesus to go away,
and for the Comforter to come.

IO                   THE ooshEE BY JOHN.

   3. " REPROVE " is translated from a word which includes the
 meaning of the words " convince " and " convict." The work
 of the Comforter relates to sin, righteousness, and judgment.
 He convicts us of sin and cleanses us from it. He convinces of
 Christ's righteousness and brings it to us. He convinces us of
 a future judgment and prepares us for it. He convicts the
 world of sin "because they believe not on Me." That is, with-
out faith in Christ, condemnation still rests upon them. " Of
 righteousness, because I go to My Father, and ye see Me no
 more." That is, as the Saviour was going away, the Comforter
would manifest, or reveal, God's righteousness, teach its princi-
ples, and implant them in the hearts of men. Verses 12-15.
"Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged."
That is, as Satan, the prince of this world, was judged or cast
out (see John 12: 31; Rev. 12: 7-13), at the close of the Sav-
iour's work on earth, so the Comforter would convince and
convict the world of a final judgment, when all must stand be-
fore the judgment-seat of Christ.
   4. " HE will show you things to come." Thus our Lord
clearly taught His people that the Holy Spirit would move upon
the hearts of His servants in this dispensation and reveal to them
future events, as well as in ancient times; in other words, that
the gift of prophecy would be exercised in the Christian church.
See Acts 2: 38, 39; Rom. 12: 6; 1 Cor. 12 : I, 7-10, 28; Eph.
4 : 11-13.
   5. By comparing verse 16 with John 14 : 1-3, it is evident that
Jesus is referring to his going to heaven to prepare a place for
His people.
                    SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.
  I. WHY did none of them ask Christ, "Whither goest Thou "?
  2. What work upon the heart does the Spirit of God perform?
See 2 Cor 3 : 3; Heb. 8 : 10.
  3. How was the " prince of this world " judged?
  4. How does the Spirit of God show us things to come?
  5. Are there any other parties to the partnership mentioned in
verse 15?

       LESSON IV.-April 24, 1897.
                PARTING INSTRUCTION.
                    (Chapter i6, verses 57-33.)


                          QUESTIONS.

   I. WHAT inquiries did the disciples make among themselves?
   2. How did they repeat the inquiry? What did they ac-
knowledge?
   3. Of what was Jesus aware?
   4. What question did He ask them?
   5. How did He contrast their experience with that of the
world?
   6. What change did He say would come in their experience?
   7. With what illustration did He enforce the teaching?
   8. How did He apply the illustration?
   9. What would be true "in that day "? What promise was
made?
  ro. What encouragement was given for making larger re-
quests?             •
  tr. How had Christ been speaking unto His disciples? What
change would He make in His manner of teaching?
  12. How would requests be made? What would be unneces-
sary? For what reason? Upon what was this reason based?
  13. Whence came Christ? To what? What was He soon to
do?
  14. How did His disciples respond to this statement?
  15. Of what were they now convinced? To what conclusion
did this lead them?
  16. What question did Jesus ask?
  17. What prediction did He then make? What would be His
comfort in this hour of trial?
                FOR MISSION WORK IN JAPAN.
12                  THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

  18. For what purpose had Christ been instructing His disci-
ples?
  19. What experience awaited them? What assurance was
given?

                             NOTES.
   I. THE experience mentioned in verse 20 evidently refers to
the time immediately following Christ's crucifixion and resur-
rection. Compare with verse 22. From that time and onward
they were to ask nothing of Him, but to ask the Father in His
name. See verses 23-26. The reason He states in verse 27,
where He says, " For the Father Himself loveth you, because
ye have loved Me, and have believed that I came out from God."
In this instruction we see how wisely and effectually Jesus sought
to reveal the character of God, and direct the minds of His dis-
ciples to His Father as the source of all good, by teaching them
to pray to the Father in His name.
  2. THE world may hate us and harass us and cause us tribula-
tion and sorrow, but in Jesus there are rest and peace. This
peace comes from harmony with God, and the assurance that
as Christ has overcome the world, its trials, its troubles, its
temptations, and all the power of the enemy, so He will give us
power to do the same, to overcome as He overcame. Therefore
we are to be of good cheer; victory is sure; deliverance will
come.

                    SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.
  1. WHAT do you think is implied in our Saviour's statement,
"Ye shall see Me, because I go to the Father "? Compare John
14 : 2; Rev. 21 : 3.
  2. With verses 30-32 read r Cor. to : 12; first sentence of 2
Cor. 13 : 5, and 2 Peter I : 1-12.
  3. How can we have tribulation in the world and still have
peace in Christ?

          LESSON V.—flay 1, 1897.
                THE PRAYER OF CHRIST.
                     (Chapter 17, verses 1-13.)

                          QUESTIONS.
   1. WHAT did Jesus do after speaking these words?
   2. With what statement did He open His prayer?
   3. What was the first petition? What was its purpose?
   4. What power did He acknowledge that He had received?
   5. What did He declare to be eternal life?
   6. What had Christ accomplished during His earthly career?
   7. What petition did He base upon this fact?
   8. What had He done to His followers?
   9. How did they come to be followers of Christ? What had
been their experience?
  10. What had His followers learned?
  tr. What had Christ imparted to them? With what result?
  12. For whom did He pray? How is the statement repeated?
  13. What statements show the complete union of the Father
and the Son?
  14. 'What change was coming in Christ's experience? Where
were His followers? What petition does He make in their be-
half?
  15. What had Christ done for them? To what extent was
this true? Upon what did the exception rest?
  16. Where was Christ about to go?
  17. With what intent was He saying these things?

                             NOTES.
   I. IN verse 2 we learn that Christ was given power or author-
ity to give eternal life to as many as the Father had given Him.

14                  THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

By comparing this verse with verses 6-12 we learn who were
given to Him, namely, those who keep God's word. See verse
6, last clause. The reason why Judas was lost was because he
forsook Jesus, and thus departed from God's word. So when
we yield our hearts to God, to keep his word, and do not for-
sake Jesus, we will be "kept by the power of God through faith
unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time." I Peter
I:5.
  2. To know the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom He
has sent, will make a person a Christian, a true child of God,
because he who knows God truly will love and obey Him. By
beholding we become changed into the same image. 2 Cor.
3 : 18. Our love for God will be in proportion to our acquaint-
ance with Him. Hence, eternal life is sure to those who know
God; for they are connected with the source of life.

  3. "IN the intercessory prayer of Jesus with His Father, He
claimed that He had fulfilled the conditions which made it oblig-
atory upon the Father to fulfil His part of the contract made in
heaven with regard to fallen man. He prayed: ' I have finished
the work which thou gayest me to do. [That is, He had wrought
out a righteous character on earth as an example for men to
follow.] And now, 0 Father, glorify Thou Me with Thine own
self, with the glory which I had with Thee before the world
was.' "—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3, 15. 26o.
  4. "I PRAY for them." " The blood of Jesus is pleading with
power and efficacy for those who are backslidden, for those who
are rebellious, for those who sin against great light and love.
Satan stands at our right hand to accuse us, and our Advocate
stands at God's right hand to plead for us. He has never lost
a case that has been committed to Him. We may trust in our
Advocate, for He pleads His own merits in our behalf. Hear
His prayer before his betrayal and trial, . . . and let every
word be engraven upon the tablets of the soul."—Review and
Herald, August 15, 1893.

  12. How is such unity secured? What would the world thus
be led to acknowledge?
  13. What was Christ's wish? What privilege would thus be
conferred? Since when did God love His Son?
  14. Who did not know God? Who did know Him? What
did the disciples know?

With what purpose in view?


                             NOTES.
   I. " IT is the will of God that union and brotherly love should
exist among His people. The prayer of Christ just before His
crucifixion was that His disciples might be one as He is one with
the Father, that the world might believe that God had sent Him.
This most touching and wonderful prayer reaches down the
ages, even to our day; for His words were, ' Neither pray I for
these alone, but for them also which shall believe on Me through
their word.' While we are not to sacrifice one principle of
truth, it should be our constant aim to reach this state of unity.
This is the evidence of our discipleship. Said Jesus, ' By this
shall all men know that ye are My disciples, if ye have love one
to another.'"—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 520.
  2. "THE children of God are those who are partakers of His
nature. It is not earthly rank, nor birth, nor nationality, nor
religious privilege, which proves that we are members of the
family of God; it is love,—a love that embraces all humanity.
Even sinners, whose hearts are not utterly closed to God's
Spirit, will respond to kindness; while they may give hate for
hate, they will also give love for love. But it is only the Spirit
of God that gives love for hatred. To be kind to the unthank-
ful and to the evil, to do good, hoping for nothing again, is the
insignia of the royally of heaven, the sure token by which the
children of the Highest reveal their high estate."— Thoughts

  3. IT is a most encouraging and comforting thought that the
Father loves us the same as He loves His only-begotten Son.
This is clearly stated in the Saviour's prayer. See verse 23.
But this is not all; the same love which God has for His Son
and for us,—" the love of God,"—is shed abroad in our hearts
by the Holy Spirit (Rom. 5: 5) if we are true believers, and
Jesus reveals the Father to us that this experience may be ours
(Rom. 5: x). He says, "And I have declared unto them Thy
name, and will declare it; that the love wherewith Thou hast
loved Me may be in them, and I in them." Verse 26.

                   SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.
   I. STUDY Christ's manner of living in this world (see Matt.
8 : 20; and 10 : 25), and read again verse 18 of our lessbn. Are
we content to be as our Master?
   2. By what means can the union for which Jesus prayed be
secured among God's people?
   3. Since God loves me as He loved Christ, and since He loved
Him because he " lay down His life for the sheep," what ought
to be my attitude toward the sheep? See x John 3 : 16.

                           NOTES.

  I. " HE [Jesus] stood in advance of His disciples, and in-
quired, ' Whom seek ye?' They answered, Jesus of Nazareth.'
Jesus replied, ' I am He.' As these words were uttered, the
mob staggered back; and the priests, elders, soldiers, and
even Judas, dropped powerless to the ground. This gave
Jesus ample opportunity to escape from them if He had chosen
to do so. But He stood as one glorified amid that coarse and
hardened band. When Jesus answered, I am He,' the angel
who had lately ministered unto Him moved between Him and

                    THE GOSPEL ET JOHN.

the murderous mob, who saw a divine light illuminating the
Saviour's face, and a dove-like form overshadowing Him. Their
wicked hearts were filled with terror. They could not for a
moment stand upon their feet in the presence of this divine
glory, and they fell as dead men to the ground. . . .
  " When the angel departed, the Roman soldiers started to
their feet, and with the priests and Judas, gathered about Christ,
as though ashamed of their weakness, and fearful that He would
yet escape from their hands. Again the question was asked by
the Redeemer, ' Whom seek ye?' Again they answered, ' Jesus
of Nazareth.' The Saviour then said, ' I have told you that I am
He. If, therefore, ye seek Me, let these go their way'—point-
ing to the disciples. In this hour of humiliation, Christ's
thoughts were not for Himself, but for His beloved disciples.
 He wished to save them from any farther trial of their
strength."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3, pp. 102, 103.
  2. " BAND," "captain," and " officers." Josephus says that
at the festival of the Passover, when a great multitude of peo-
ple came to observe the feast, lest there should be any disorder,
a band of men was commanded to keep watch at the porches
of the temple, to repress a tumult if any should be excited.
This band, or guard, was at the disposal of the chief priests.
See Matt. 27 : 65. It was composed of Roman soldiers, and was
stationed chiefly at the tower of Antonia, at the northwest side
of the temple. In addition to this, they had constant guards
stationed around the temple, composed of Levites. "The cap-
tain and officers of the Jews" probably referred to those who
had charge of the temple guard.
   3. JESUS was brought before Annas first because he was prob-
ably regarded by the Jews as the legitimate high priest, accord-
ing to their customs. He was deposed by Valerius Gratus, and
after several changes, Caiaphas, his son-in-law, was chosen.
See Alford's Notes on Luke 3 : 2. By reference to that scripture
it will be seen that both were counted as high priests at the
time John the Baptist began his ministry.

  4. "THE coldest hour of the night was that preceding the
dawn, and a fire had been lighted in the hall. Around this a
company were gathered; and Peter presumptuously took his
place with the rest by the fire, and stood warming himself. He
did not wish to be recognized as one of the disciples of Jesus,
and he thought by mingling carelessly with the people he would
be taken for one of those who had brought Jesus to the hall."
  " Many who do not hesitate to engage in active warfare for
the Lord, are driven to deny their faith through the ridicule of
their enemies. They place themselves in the way of temptation
by associating with those whom they should avoid. They thus
invite the enemy to tempt them, and are led to do and say that
which they would never have been guilty of under other circum-
stances. The disciple of Christ who in our day disguises his
faith through dread of suffering or reproach, denies his Lord as
virtually as did Peter in the judgment-hall. There are always
those who boast of their freedom of thought and action, and
laugh at the scruples of the conscientious who fear to do wrong.
Yet if those righteous persons are persuaded to yield their faith,
they are despised by the very ones who were Satan's agents to
tempt them to their ruin."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3, pp. 107,
1°8, II 2, 113.

       LESSON V111.—Ilay 22, 1897.
  THE ECCLESIASTICAL TRIAL; THE CIVIL TRIAL.

                    (Chapter 18, verses 19-40.)

                          QUESTIONS.

    I. ON what points was Jesus then examined?
    2. To whom did Jesus say He had spoken? Where had He
taught? What plan of teaching had He avoided?
    3. What course did He recommend to the high priest? Why
ought this to be satisfactory?
    4. What did one of the officers then do? What inquiry ac-
companied the blow?
    5. How did Jesus respond to this insult?
    6. To whom was Jesus then taken? See Revised Version.
    7. Where was Peter? What inquiry was addressed to him

    8. How was he questioned the third time? Who asked him
this time?

  22. With what inquiry did Pilate close his examination?

  24. To what custom did he then refer? What question did

  25. How did the Jews respond to this effort to release Jesus?
Who was Barabbas?

                             NOTES.
  I. " LEST they should be defiled." The accusers of Jesus
considered the touch of a Gentile to be a source of defilement,
and on this occasion they were so afraid of being polluted that
they would not enter the house of a Gentile. They could cher-
ish malice and murder in their hearts, and imbrue their hands
in the blood of Jesus, but they were exceedingly careful to
avoid defilement by touching a sinner. This shows how much
more concerned men will often be to avoid the violation of
mere forms of religion than to have the heart pure and the life
holy. Some will endeavor to quiet their consciences amid their
deeds of wickedness, by the observance of the ceremonies of
religion.
  2. JESUS had foretold how He would be putto death, and who
would do it. Matt. 20: 19. He was to be crucified by the Ro-
mans, as that was their manner of executing criminals at that
time. This explains the statement made in verses 31, 32. Of
course the Jews secured His conviction, and were therefore held
responsible for His death. John 19 : it; Acts 4 : to; 7 : 52.
      " MY kingdom is not of this world;" that is, of this world
in its present state; is not given by this world, neither is it of
the same nature as earthly kingdoms. They are ruled by force,
and their subjects fight to defend them. Not so, however, with
Christ's kingdom. He says, " If My kingdom were of this

 world, then would My servants fight, that I should not be de-
 livered to the Jews." Verse 36. The Christian is not to fight
 with carnal weapons to defend his Master or his cause.
Christ's reign now is spiritual. His dominion is over the heart,
subduing evil passions and corrupt desires. Love, and not
 force, is the ruling principle; and while there is a warfare to be
 waged, the weapons are spiritual and not carnal. See 2 Cor.
1- 0 : 4; Eph. 6 : to-17.

                    SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.
  I. WHY did Jesus answer some questions at His trial and re-
fuse to answer others? See verses 19, 23, 33-37; 19 :
Matt. 27 : 11-14, and Mark 14 : 6o-62.
  2. Was it the Church or the State that put Christ to death?
  3. Was there a union of the Jewish Church and the Roman
State? See Mark 3 : 6; 12 : 13; Luke zo : 20; Matt. 22 : 16. Who
were the Herodians?

     12. What effect did this have upon Pilate?
     13. What pressure did the Jews then bring to bear upon him
  to secure the condemnation of Jesus?
    14. How far did they succeed?
    15. What day was it? What time of the day? How did

    17. What question did Pilate then ask? How was it an-

     18. How did he then yield to their demands?
    19. What did they do with Jesus?

                              NOTES.
     I. WHEN Pilate asked Jesus the question, "Whence art
  Thou?" Jesus gave him no answer. Verse 9. " Pilate was
  vexed at the silence of Jesus, and haughtily addressed Him :
   Speakest Thou not unto me? knowest Thou not that I have
  power to crucify Thee, and have power to release Thee? Jesus
• answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against Me, ex-
  cept it were given thee from above; therefore he that delivered
  Me unto thee hath the greater sin.' Jesus here laid the heaviest
  burden of guilt upon the Jewish judges, who had received
  unmistakable evidence of the divinity of Him whom they had
  condemned to death, both from the prophecies and His own
  teachings and miracles. What a scene was this to hand down
  to the world through all time ! The pitying Saviour, in the
  midst of His intense suffering and grief, excuses as far as pos-
         SABBATH SCHOOL CONTRIBUTIONS THIS QUARTER
                    THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.                      25

sible the act of Pilate, who might have released Him from the
power of His enemies."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3,p. 145.
  The Saviour's answer shows that no power can be exercised
against the cause or people of God, except what the Lord per-
mits, and the Lord will permit that only which will be for the
good of those who love Him. This should be a source of great
comfort to the tempted, buffeted, persecuted child of God as
he battles with Satan and the powers of darkness.
  2. THE statement made in verse 14, that it was about the
sixth hour when the trial closed and the decision was made to
crucify Jesus, presents a chronological difficulty when compared
with the statements made in the other Gospels. Various theo-
ries or ideas have been advanced for the purpose of removing
the difficulty. The one most generally adopted is that there
was an error in transcribing the numeral in verse 14. This
would not be a strange mistake, because it has been proven
that it was common at that time to use letters to indicate num-
bers, instead of writing them out in words, and that the letters
which were used to represent the numbers three and six might
easily be mistaken for each other. Therefore the conclusion
is reached that the numeral letter in John 19 : 14 should have
been transcribed third instead of sixth, and thus it would har-
monize with the statements in the other Gospels.
  3. THE great lengths to which people will go in wickedness
and oppression when they reject light and close their minds
and hearts against the evidences of truth, is illustrated in the
cases of Pilate and the chief priests. " Pilate had taken step
after step in the violation of his conscience, and in excusing
himself from judging with equity and fairness, as his position
demanded he should do, until now he found himself almost help-
less in the hands of the Jews." " His wavering and indecision
proved his irredeemable ruin. How many, like Pilate, sacrifice
principle and integrity, in order to shun disagreeable conse-
quences! Conscience and duty point one way, and self-interest
points another ; and the current, setting strongly in the wrong

direction, sweeps away into the thick darkness of guilt him who
compromises with evil."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3, pp. 142,
117-
  But, as before shown, Jesus laid the heaviest burden of guilt
upon the Jewish judges, because they had greater light, both
from the prophecies and Christ's teachings and miracles.

                    SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.
  I. WHAT relation did the crown of thorns which Jesus wore
bear to the curse mentioned in Gen. 3: 17, 18?

of a skull. The original Greek word in Luke 23: 33 means a
skull, and the Latin word "Calvary" signifies a skull or place of
skulls. It is not known positively why this name was given to
the place. Some have thought it was because the hill resem-
bled a human skull in shape; others think it was so called
because it was a place for the execution of criminals.
  2. "PILATE then wrote an inscription in three different lan-
guages, and placed it upon the cross, above the head of Jesus.

28                   THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

It ran thus : ' This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.' This inscrip-
tion, placed so conspicuously upon the cross, irritated the Jews.
In Pilate's court they had cried, ' Crucify Him ! We have no
king but Cesar!' They declared that whoever claimed other
than Csar for a king was a traitor. But they had overreached
themselves in disclaiming any desire to have a king of their
own nation. Pilate, in this inscription, wrote out the senti-
ments which they had expressed. It was a virtual declaration,
and so understood by all, that the Jews acknowledged that, on
account of their allegiance to the Roman power, any man who
aspired to be king of the Jews, however innocent in other
respects, should be judged by them worthy of death. There
was no other offense named in the inscription ; it simply stated
that Jesus was the king of the Jews."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3,
p• 155.
  3. "THE eyes of Jesus wandered over the multitude that had
collected together to witness His death, and He saw at the foot of
the cross, John supporting Mary, the mother of Christ. . . .
He looked upon the grief-stricken face of His mother, and then
upon John. Said He, addressing the former, 'Woman, behold'
thy son 1' then to the disciple, ' Behold thy mother!' John
well understood the words of Jesus, and the sacred trust which
was committed to him. He immediately removed the mother
of Christ from the fearful scene of Calvary. From that hour he
cared for her as would a dutiful son, taking her to his own
home. 0 pitiful, loving Saviour! Amid all His physical pain,
and mental anguish, He had a tender, thoughtful care for the
mother who had borne Him. He had no money to leave her
by which to insure her future comfort, but He was enshrined in
the heart of John, and He gave His mother unto the beloved
disciple as a sacred legacy. . . . The followers of Christ
should feel that it is a part of their religion to respect and pro-
vide for their parents. No pretext of religious devotion can
excuse a son or daughter from fulfilling the obligations due to
a parent."—Id., pp. .16o, P51

  4. " JESUS did not yield up His life till He had accomplished
the work which He came to do ; and He exclaimed with His
parting breath, `It is finished ! ' Angels rejoiced as the words
were uttered ; for the great plan of redemption was being tri-
umphantly carried out. There was joy in heaven that the sons
of Adam could now, through a life of obedience, be exalted
finally to the presence of God. Satan was defeated, and knew
that his kingdom was lost."—Id., pp. 167, 168.
  5. " THE consent of the governor having been obtained, the
legs of the two that were crucified with Jesus were broken, to
hasten their death ; but Jesus was already dead, and they broke
not His legs. The rude soldiers who had witnessed the looks
and words of Jesus upon His way to Calvary, and while dying
upon the cross, were softened by what they had witnessed, and
were restrained from marring Him by breaking His limbs.
Thus was prophecy fulfilled, which declared that a bone of Him
should not be broken; and the law of the Passover, requiring
the sacrifice to be perfect and whole, was also fulfilled in the.
offering of the Lamb of God : They shall leave none of it until
the morning, nor break any bone of it ; according to all the ordi-
 nances of the Passover they shall keep it,' "—Id., pp. 171, 172.


                    SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.

  I. HAS the seamless coat of Jesus any spiritual significance?
  2. How did Jesus know "all things were accomplished "?
and how did He know it was necessary for Him to say, "I
thirst" in order "that the Scripture might be fulfilled "? (See
article on first page of October, 1896, Sabbath School Worker.)
  3. Why was John so particular to mention the fact that water
and blood flowed from the Saviour's side when it was pierced?

       BURIAL AND RESURRECTION OF JESUS.
                      (Chapter 19 : 38 to 20: io. )

                            QUESTIONS.
     I. AFTER   the death of Jesus, what request was made of
Pilate?
    2. What is said of him who made the request?

   15. Where did they now go?
                                NOTES.
  I. " JOHN was at a loss to know what measures he should
take in regard to the body of his beloved Master. . . . But
Joseph and Nicodemus came to the front in this emergency.
Both of these men were members of the Sanhedrin, and
        SABBATH SCHOOL CONTRIBUTIONS THIS QUARTER

acquainted with Pilate. Both were men of wealth and influ-
ence." " Neither of these men had openly attached himself
to the Saviour while He was living, although both believed
on Him. They knew that if they declared their faith they
would be excluded from the Sanhedrin council, on account of
the prejudice of the priests and elders toward Jesus. This
would have cut them off from all power to aid or protect Him
by using their influence in the council. Several times they had
shown the fallacy of the grounds of His condemnation, and
protested against His arrest, and the council had broken up
without accomplishing that for which it had been called to-
gether; for it was impossible to procure the condemnation of
Jesus without the unanimous consent of the Sanhedrin. The
object of the priests had finally been obtained by calling a
secret counsel, to which Joseph and Nicodemus •were not
summoned.
   " The two councilors now came boldly forth to the aid of the
disciples. The help of these rich and honored men was greatly
needed at that time. They could do for the slain Saviour what
it was impossible for the poorer disciples to do ; and their influ-
ential positions protected them in a great measure from censure
and remonstrance."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3, p p. 173, 175.
   2. EMBALMING among the Jews consisted mainly in wrapping
the body in many folds of linen with a profusion of aromatic
spices—myrrh, aloes, etc.

                    SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.
  I. WAS it an ordinary request which Joseph made in asking
for the body of Jesus?
  2. Who first announced that Jesus had risen? Are there any
other instances where woman has led out in God's work?
  3. In connection with such an event, and amid such exciting
scenes, why is such pains taken to describe the position of a
napkin?
  4. Why did        disciples not know the Scripture that He
must rise again from the dead? Is there any lesson here for us?

                            NOTES.
  I. " THE same day at evening, being the first day of the
week." This was the same day in which the events took place
which are narrated in the previous eighteen verses. From this
we know that the meeting recorded in verse 19 occurred in the
evening following the first day of the week. The following
account of the arrival at Jerusalem of the two disciples from
Emmaus after Jesus had made Himself known to them, will be
of interest to the student:—
  " When the disciples arrived at Jerusalem, they entered the
eastern gate, which was open on festal occasions. The houses
were dark and silent, but they made their way through the nar-
row streets by the light of the rising moon. They knew that
they would find their brethren in the memorable upper cham-
ber where Jesus had spent the last night before His death.
. . Cautious hands unbarred the door to the repeated demand
of the two. travelers ; they entered, and with them also entered
Jesus, who had been their unseen companion all the way. . .
    When the disciples from Emmaus entered with their joyful
tidings, they were met by the exclamation from many voices,
 `The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.'"—
 Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3, pp. 216, 217.
  2. " WHosEsoEvER sins ye remit, they are remitted unto
them." " Jesus, in giving the disciples their first commission,
had said, ' I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of
heaven, and whatsoever thou [referring to responsible men
                 FOR MISSION WORK IN JAPAN.
34                  THE GOSPEL BY JOHN.

who should represent His church] shall bind upon earth shall
be bound in heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
shall be loosed in heaven.' In renewing the commission of
those to whom He had imparted the Holy Ghost, He said,
 Whosesoever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and
whosesoever sins ye retain, they are retained.' These words
conveyed to the disciples a sense of the sacredness of their
work, and its tremendous results. Imbued with the Spirit of
God, they were to go forth, preaching the merits of a sin-
pardoning Saviour ; and they had the assurance that all Heaven
was interested in their labors, and that what they did on earth,
in the Spirit and power of Christ, should be ratified in heaven.
. . . The Saviour taught that His is the only name given un-
der heaven whereby men shall be saved. Jesus, however, dele-
gated to His church upon earth, in her organized capacity, the
power to censure, and to remove censure, according to the
rules prescribed by inspiration ; but these acts were only to be
done by men of good repute, who were consecrated by the
great Head of the church, and who showed by their lives that
they were earnestly seeking to follow the guidance of the Spirit
of God."—Id., pp. 244, 245-
   Through the labors of the apostles and God's servants in
preaching the Word, people would believe the gospel, and their
sins would be remitted, as illustrated on the day of Pentecost.
Acts 2: 37, 38. The power of God's Word over the people,
when proclaimed by God's servants, is also illustrated in the
case of Jeremiah. (See Jer. 1 :9, 10.)

                   SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.
     I. WHAT   lesson is there for us in the tarrying of Jesus to
meet Mary at the sepulcher?
   2. Jesus said to Mary, " Touch Me not " (verse 17), and yet
later He permitted His disciples to touch Him (see Matt. 28: 9).
How do you explain this?
   3. In the light of verse 23, Matt. 18: 15-18; and Jer. 50: 2o,
is there any importance attached to membership in the church?

                               NOTES.
   r. "THEY remembered that at the commencement of His
ministry a similar scene had been enacted to that which had
just taken place. Jesus had then bade them launch out into
the deep, and let down their nets for a draught, and the net
had broken because of the amount of fishes taken. Then He
bade them leave their nets and follow Him, and He would
make them fishers of men. This last miracle that Jesus had
just wrought was for the purpose of making the former miracle
more impressive ; that the disciples might perceive that, not-
withstanding they were to be deprived of the personal compan-
ionship of their Master, and of the means of sustenance by the
pursuit of their favorite employment, yet a resurrected Saviour
had a care over them, and would provide for them while they
were doing His Work. Jesus also had a purpose in bidding
them cast their net upon the right side of the ship. On that
side stood Christ upon the shore. If they labored in connection
with Him—His divine power uniting with their human effort—
they would not fail of success.
  " The repetition of the miraculous draught of fishes was a
renewal of Christ's commission to His disciples. It showed
them that the death of their Master did not remove their obli-
gation to do the work which He had assigned them."—Spirit
of Prophecy, vol. 3, pp.   228, 229.

     2. "THE disciples expected that Peter would no longer be
  allowed to occupy the prominent position in the work which he
S had hitherto held, and he himself had lost his customary self-
  confidence. But Jesus, while dining by the seaside, singled
  out Peter, saying, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou Me more
  than these?' referring to his brethren. . . . Three times
  had Peter openly denied his Lord, and three times did Jesus
  draw from him the assurance of his love and loyalty, by pressing
  home that pointed question, like a barbed arrow, to his wounded
  heart. Jesus, before, the assembled disciples, brought out the
  depth of Peter's penitence, and showed how thoroughly hum-
  bled was the once boasting disciple. He was now intrusted
  with the important commission of caring for the flock of Christ.
  Though every other qualification might be unexceptionable,
  yet without the love of Christ he could not be a faithful shep-
  herd over the Christian flock."—Id., pp. 229-231.
     3. " JESUS here explicitly stated to Peter the fact and manner
  of his death; He even referred to the stretching forth of his hands
  upon the cross ; and after He had thus spoken, He repeated His
  former injunction, Follow Me.' The disciple was not dis-
  concerted by the revelation of his Master. He felt willing to
  suffer any death for his Lord. Peter saw that John was follow-
  ing, and a desire came over him to know his future, and he
    saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do? Jesus saith
  unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?
  follow thou Me.' Peter should have considered that his Lord
  would reveal to him all that it was best for him to know, with-
  out inquiry on his part. It is the duty of every one to follow
  Christ, without undue anxiety as to the duty assigned to others.
   In saying of John, ' If I will that he tarry till I come,' Jesus gave
  no assurance that this disciple should live until the second com-
  ing of Christ ; He merely asserted His own supreme power, and
  that even if He should will this to be so, it would in no way
  affect the work of Peter. The future of both John and Peter
   was in the hands of the Lord, and obedience in following Him
   was the duty required of each."—Id., pp. 232, 233.

       On its shore the night-long fishers
        Saw the Man of Calvary.
       He had borne the taunts and jeering,
        Borne the cross and thorny crown,
       Borne the angry oaths and mockings,
        Borne the sins that crushed Him down.

                         A beautifully printed descriptive list of

a new series of Self-Pronouncing Bibles, and a four-page reduced
price list on Oxford Teachers' Bibles containing old helps.
PUBLICATION CATALOG Our new sixty-page Spring
                               Catalog is now ready for dis-
tribution. It contains many new features, and will be found
fully up to date.
TRACT CATALOG A Descriptive Catalog of Apples of
                        Gold, Bible Students' and Religious
Liberty Libraries. This gives a brief but accurate description
of the contents of each number, and will be found especially
valuable by those engaged in the tract work.

                 Blessing, Sketches of Bible Child Life, Young
People's Library, Story of Pitcairn, Two Republics, In the Heart
of the Sierras, Sunshine at Home, Sunbeams of Health and
Temperance, Fireside Sketches of Scenery and Travel, Strong's
Concordance, Walker's Concordance, and of other books too
numerous to mention.
    These catalogs and circulars are all sent free on receipt of
a postal card request for them.
LETTERS of inquiry receive our careful attention, and when-
              ever the descriptive matter above referred to is
not sufficient in itself to answer such inquiries, we gladly sup-
plement it with personal letters.
