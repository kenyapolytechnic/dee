    "And these wordi, which I command thee this day, shall be
in thine heart; and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children,
and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when
thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou
risest up." Deut. 6 : 6, 7.
    " Parents, set apart a little time each day for the study of the
Sabbath-school lesson with your children."—Mrs. E. G. White.



 PROGRAM FOR FAMILY STUDY OF THE S. S. LESSONS.
    SABBATH.—(After church services or at the close of the
Sabbath.) Read carefully the lesson for the next Sabbath,
and assign verses to be memorized during the week.
    SUNDAY.—Name the persons and places mentioned in
the lesson, and locate the places on the map. Pronounce and
define the hard words.
    MONDAY. —Let each tell what he can of the lesson, and
then read it over, carefully rioting the points which were not
rem embered.
    TUESDAY.—Repeat verses already committed to mem-
ory. Read the " Spirit of Prophecy " on the lesson, or study
the lesson from the Instructor or Little Friend.
    WEDNESDAY.—Let each give a synopsis of the lesson,
or tell the lesson story. Look up the ancient manners and cus-
toms referred 10.
    THURSDAY.—Name again the persons mentioned, and
tell what each said or did. Give time and place of each event.
    FRIDAY.—Ask the questions from the lesson book, study
the notes, and repeat the memory verses.
    SABBATH.—Let each repeat as much of the lesson scrip-
ture as possible. Give each one the privilege of questioning
others upon the lesson. Relate personal experiences in which
the truths of the lesson have been helpful.


   (This program is simply suggestive and can of course be varied
to suit circumstances, but we do urge upon all the necessity of daily,
systematic study of the scriptures covered by the Sabbath-school les-
sons.)

     SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS AND PUPILS.

                     TO BE READ BY ALL.

  STUDY the text thoroughly. Although the lessons may seem
long when considered in relation to the half hour allowed to
them in the Sabbath-school, they are really very short when
considered in relation to the entire week, which may be devoted
to the study of each one. It should be a comparatively light
task for anybody to become thoroughly familiar with the book
of Acts in an entire year. At the close of that time, every one
who has followed the lessons through, ought to be able to locate
off hand any passage or incident, or to give the main features
of any chapter. Each one who conscientiously works to this
end, will find that the entering of the Word gives light.
  To avoid confusion, it is best in general to get the text of the
                                                     (3)
4                  ACTS OF THE APOSTLES.

lesson well in mind before launching out to other scriptures. It
is the book of Acts we are studying, and this should be studied
and learned first of all. Then it will furnish a good nucleus
around which to gather other portions of Scripture. One por-
tion well fixed in mind, will help to hold many others.
   Don't confine yourself to the questions given, only let all
your questions be directly on the text. These questions are
suggestive, and not by any means exhaustive. He who can
dispense with the lesson book entirely and question directly
from the Bible, does the best work; but let him not fail to stick
to the Bible. Ask questions on the text, and only such as can
be answered by the text of the lesson, or by some parallel
scripture. Don't speculate, and don't encourage speculation
or conjecture. To depend wholly upon the questions provided
by the lesson book, or to confine one's self to them, is a mark
of indolence or incapacity; but to indulge in speculation con-
cerning the Holy Scriptures is gross sin. Let us be neither
indolent nor wicked.




           LESSON 1.-July 3, 1897.

              DEPARTURE AND PROMSES.

sus give to His chosen apostles before He was taken up?
Through what power did He give these commandments?

was to be restored to Israel? See Eze. 21 : 25-27; Micah 4: 8.

   2. Study the matter of witnessing. To what are all Christ's
followers to witness? By what power only can they witness?
What kind of witness is Jesus? To what did He come into the
world to witness? What is always required of a witness?
John 3: 11.
   3. "This same Jesus." What other scriptures can you cite
that show the same thing? Jesus ascended in a cloud; the an-
gels said He should come in like manner as He ascended; how
then will He come? Is there any direct statement to this effect?
   4. Are we also to be witnesses with respect to Christ's resur-
rection? May we be as sure of the resurrection of Jesus as the
first disciples were? Can we have as good evidence of it as
they had? and can we testify of it as positively as they did? Is
it necessary to have been with Jesus during His earthly ministry
in order to be a witness of His resurrection? How about Paul?
   5. What "exceeding great and precious promises" are re-
corded or referred to in this chapter?

          ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS.
  I. NOTE that the Spirit of God comes in fulness and power
where there is unity. By what is the Spirit grieved away?
  2. Is there in this lesson any instruction as to how to "reach

wine, but to be filled with the Spirit?

Poured out as fulfilled at Pentecost? In what days must we,
therefore, be living?
  5. The Spirit of God is poured out on " all flesh ; " why,
then, are not the fruits of the Spirit seen in all? See Acts 7 : 51.
So with the gifts of the Spirit. In the apostolic church, the
Lord confirmed the word with signs following. See Mark
16 : 17-2o. But when the church departed from the Word, then
the signs departed from the church.

                           NOTES.
   I. "UNLEARNED and ignorant men." The Greek word is
idioles, from which comes our word " idiot." Its primary
meaning, however, is "common people," or, as the German
and Danish have it, " layfolk." The idea of ignorance is a
secondary one derived from the Pharisaic notion that common
people could not be expected to know anything. It was the

common people, however, who gladly listened to Jesus, and
the common people who are taught by Him " in whom are
hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge" (Col. 2 : 3),
have more true wisdom than all those who profess themselves
to be wise. Compare Prov. 2: 1-9; Ps. 119 : 99, ioo; Rom.
I : 21, 22.
  2. THE disciples said, "We can not but speak the things
that we have seen and heard." Would it have been as well

the difference?

  IT is a point worthy of note, that these seven men were not
appointed to raise money, but to distribute it. When the
believers are all of one heart and soul, being filled with the
Holy Ghost, and are bearing their testimony with the power of
the Spirit, the question is not how means shall be obtained, but
how to distribute the abundance that flows in. Notice also
that the men who have to do with the financial part of the work
of the Lord, need to have as much of the Holy Ghost as those
who preach the Word.

nacle and temple and the lesson drawn from them, found in
verses 44-50. The sudden change in the subject, and the
language used, show that he discerned the fact that they were
convicted of the truth, but were resisting the Spirit and rejecting
the light which was shining upon them. See verses 51-53.

            As an indication of the attitude of the religious
            press toward this book, we subjoin the following
            notices:

     Free flethodist.—its entire trend indicates the author's confidence in the
words of Christ. " The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they
are life." While those words were first addressed to a cosmopolitan gather-
ing centuries ago, they are applicable to all time, and come to us still freighted
with that same " spirit " and that same " life."
     Western Christian Advocate.—A very devout, thoughtful exposition of
the Lord Christ's words.
     Christian Observer.—Very pleasant is the style of this book, and very
helpful are its comments on the Sermon on the Mount.
     Baptist Union.—It can by no means be read with profit at one sitting, but
is a book for time of meditation, as its title implies.
     Southern Churchman.—A deeply religious book.. . . The pub-
lishers have gotten it out, both in type and illustrations, vary well indeed.
     Herald and Presbyter.—This is a book of faith and devotion. Far from
being a mere lecture on outward morality, it takes hold of She very inner being,
and insists on a life believing and following the Master in simplicity and con-
secration.
     The Lutheran Observer.—This is a devotional exposition of Christ's
Sermon on the Mount, in which the spiritual riches of the Beatitudes are un-
folded in earnest and fervid thoughts. . . . It is finely illustrated with
views of sacred scenes, and is issued by the publishers in handsome style.
     Christian Evangelist—This volume, dealing with things of the Spirit,
is a book for the quiet hour. . . . It will be found an enlightening and up-
lifting treatment of these lofty themes.
     Cumberland Presbyterian.—Is a book of deep, devotional nature, tak-
ing hold of the inner being. It has much beauty of style, many apt illustra-
tions, and insists on a life of purity and consecration.
