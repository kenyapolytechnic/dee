                 INTRODUCTORY.

  No attempt has been made in this series of lessons to treat
the subject exhaustively. This would be an impossibility in so
small a compass. The subject of religious liberty is a great
subject, we might say, an almost inexhaustible one. Neither
has any attempt been made to make an application of even all
the principles brought out to the present-day movements, and
bring matters, so to speak, "up to date." The idea has been
rather to set forth clearly the principles themselves from a
Bible standpoint, thus giving the student a good foundation
upon which to build. The application of a principle is not
difficult after the principle itself is once thoroughly understood.
  The student will find it highly profitable and greatly to his
advantage during the study of these lessons to read the work
by Elder A. T. Jones entitled "The Rights of the People; or
Civil Government and Religion." This is "Civil Government
and Religion" revised and much enlarged.

    Lessons for Senior Classes, 4th Quarter, 1895.


        LESSON I.—October 5, 1895.
               THE AUTHOR OF LIBERTY.

 NOTE.—Let the texts in bold-faced type be committed to
memory, and as many more as time will permit.
     I. WHAT was Christ's mission to this world? Luke 4:18;
Isa. 6r : x.
    2. What will make men free? John 8 : 31, 32.
    3. In what condition, therefore, are those who know not the
ti uth? Ans.—In bondage; the servants, or slaves of sin. Verses
33, 34; 2 Peter 2 : 19.1Z- •
    4. How many of the human family, in their natural condition,
are slaves of sin? Rom. 3 : 23.
    5. Since Satan is the author of sin (John 8 : 44), whom do
men serve while practicing sin? Rom. 6 :16K-rJohn 3 :8.
    6. What was the salvation Christ brought to this world?
Matt. I : 2I.
     7. Since sin is of Satan, and Christ came to save men from
sin, from whose dominion did He come to free them?
    8. In what does all sin originate? i John 2 : T5-17; Rom.
7 : 7. (See note I.)
    9. What is covetousness, or selfishness? Ans.—The love of
self to the disregard of the rights of others.
                                                      (3)
   4              CIVI L AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTv.

     so. Since selfishness is the root of all sin, and Christ caine
  to save men from sin, what really was His mission? Ans.-1'o
  save in2a from the inordinate love of self, and enable them to
  recognize and respect the rights of others.
      1. What are the rights of others? Ans.—The same as our
  own. (See note 2.)
     12. By what scriptures is this clearly shown? Lev. 19 : 18;
  ilatt. 7:12.
     13. How does God estimate a man's religion? James 1 :27;
  1 John 4 :20; Matt. 25 : 4o. (See note 3.)
2    14. What, then, must men have taken from their hearts be-
  fore they will recognize the equal rights pf their fellow-men?
  Ans.—Selfishness.
     15. Who alone can cleanse the heart from selfishness, or sin?
  Acts 4:12; t John r :9.
     16. Who alone, then, can give men real freedom? John 8:36.
     17. If all men would recognize the equal rights of their
  fellow-men, would there not be perfect and universal liberty on
   earth?
     18. Could there be any tyranny or persecution under such
   circumstances?
     19. Therefore, to whom alone must we look for genuine,
   universal, and lasting liberty?


                               NOTES.
     1. THE inordinate love for that which we may think will be of
   profit and pleasure to us is the cause of all the trouble there is
   in the world. But this is simply covetousness, and covetous-
   ness, therefore, is that which lies at the bottom of every sin.
   Before any other of the ten commandments can be broken, the
   tenth must first be transgressed. Covetousness is simply
   selfishness, or a desire to gratify and please self, regardless of
   the rights of others. This was the cause of Satan's fall in
   heaven (Isa. 14 : 13, 14), and man's on earth (Gen. 3 :4-6).
   And this is the ruling spirit of the Papacy, or man of sin.
   2 TheSs. 2 : 3, 4. It is that which rules sinful men everywhere.
     2. THE rights of all men are equal. One man has no more
   inherent or natural rights than another. The framers of the
   Declaration of Independence enunciated a great truth when
                CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.

they said, "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
men are created equal, and are endowed by their. Creator with
certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness." And Christ also set forth this same
principle of equality to govern in His church, when He said, "Be
not ye called rabbi; for one is your Master, even Christ; and
all ye are brethren." Matt. 23 : 8. •
   3. IT is not so much by the number or length of prayers
offered, or by the amount of religous ceremonies performed,
that God estimates our religion, as by the way we treat our
fellow-men. They are His creatures, beings whom He has made
in His image. Gen. r : 27. We are to see the workmanship
of God in each human being, and recognize and treat each in-
dividual as God's property. The soul of every other person
 is as precious in the sight of the Lord as is our own; for the
same price has been paid for its redemption as for ours.
 Therefore, when we mistrust our fellow-men, and look down
 upon them, we are doing despite to God. It is a principle
 clearly laid down in the Bible that as we treat others God will
 treat us. Matt. 6 : 14, 15; 7 : r, 2.



       LESSON 11.—October 12, 1895.
                  THE SLAVERY OF SELF.
     I. WHAT can you say of the desirability of freedom? (See
 note 1.)
     2. Notivithstanding this general desire for freedom, are men
 by nature free? (See note 2.)
     3. In what way do men show themselves to be slaves?
   (a) By their inability to break off bad habits.
   (b)     f3llowing foolish and erroneous customs.
   (c) By want of courage to think.
   (d) By want of courage to speak.
     e) By going with the majority when the majority go wrong.
    (f) By fearing men instead of God.
   ( g) By serving men instead of serving God.
   (h) By keeping the commandments of men instead of the
 commandments of God.           .
    (1) By every sin they commit. (See note 3.)
6               CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTV.


    4. Why do men naturally do all these wrong things? Ans.
—Because of selfishness.
    5. What must everyone do in order to become a true fol-
lower of Christ? Luke 9 : 23.
    6. What stood in the way of many of the rulers confessing
Christ when He was on earth? John 12:42, 43.
    7. Whom do men love when they love the praise of men?
Ans.—Themselves.
    8: Can men truly believe on Jesus while seeking such honor?
John 5 : 43, 44.
    9. What, then, more than all else, stands in the way of faith
in Jesus?
   10. To what does this love of self lead? Ans. —It leads men
to serve men and to seek their favor, instead,of serving God
and seeking. His favor.
   ix. What direct command is given in 1 Cor. 7 : 23?
   12. Whom alone are we to serve? Matt. 4 : 10.
   13. Who can deliver men from this slavery of self and give
them power to go right though all others go wrong? 2 Peter
2 : 9; Rom. 1 i : 26; 2 Tim. 4 : 18.
   24. How free can Christ make men? John 8 : 36.
   15. How free was Paul after his conversion? 1 Cor. 9 :19. '
(See note 4.)
   16. What rule of moral independence has the Lord laid down
for all to follow? Ex. 23 : 2.

                           NOTES.
  1. FREEDOM is a condition desirable to all. Everybody likes
to be free—free to think, act, and speak, free to go where he
wishes, and do what he pleases. It is an inborn principle.
God made man free in the beginning, and it is only sin that has
brought bondage and slavery of any kind into the world. The
words of Patrick Henry, "Give me liberty, or give me death,"
are but an outburst of this natural desire for freedom.
  2. No man by nature is truly free. All, in consequence of the
fall, are slaves; all are subject to things which bring them into
bondage,—slaves of habits, customs, and traditions, slaves of
men, slaves of self, slaves of sin.
                CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.                     7

    3. MEN show themselves to be slaves in the following ways:—
    (a) They become so addicted to habits which they know are
an injury to them, that they cannot break them off. They try to
do it again and again, but fail. The habit is master, and they are
slaves. This lack of power is thus stated by the apostle: "For
what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I." Rom.
7 : 15. "For to will is present with me; but how to perform that
which is good I find not." Verse 18.
    (b) Many do things for no better reason than because oth-
ers do them, or because their forefathers did them. They
are slaves to custom. This is well illustrated by the history
of the Lamentations, recorded in 2 Kings 17:40, 41: "How-
beit they did not hearken, but they did after their former
manner [to the Lord]. So these nations feared the Lord,
and served their graven images, both their children, and their
children's children; as did their fathers, so do they unto this
day." This is also most strikingly shown in the matter of Sun-
day observance. The condition of millions in this respect is
correctly represented in the following words of Ex-Governor St.
John: "I observe Sunday as God's holy Sabbath day. I am
frank about it. It always pays a man to be frank. Now, why
do I observe Sunday?—I observe Sunday because my father
and mother observed it, and not because I have gone down
deep and searched the Bible for the truth of the matter." —
Speech in Battle Creek, Mich., Sept. 8, z89o.
    (c) Many have not the courage to think. They are afraid to
allow themselves to reason, fearing that the conclusion will
condemn them. They let others do their thinking for them.
 But God wants men to use the mental powers He has given
 them. He, the Author of our minds, says, "Come now, and
 let us reason together." Isa. 1 :18.
     (d) Others, though allowing themselves to think, have not
 the courage to give expression to their convictions, fearing it
 might cost them something to do it. This was the trouble with
 many in Christ's day. "Howbeit no man spake openly of Him
 for fear of the Jews." John 7 : 13. See also John 9 : 22.
     (e) To go with the majority or the great men when we think
 they may be going wrong. The Lord says: "Ye have plowed
  wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of
 lies; because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy
 mighty men." Hosea xo :13. "Thou shalt not follow a mul-
  titude to do evil." Ex 23 : 2.
     (f) Many shun duty for fear of what men may,think or say
 of them or do to them. Against this the Lord has often
  warned His people: "Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to
  whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their
  fear, nor be afraid. Sanctify the Lord of hosts Himself; and
8               CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.

let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread." Isa. 8 : 12,
13. See also Isa. 57 :12, 13; Matt. 10:28, 32, 33; Ps. 56 :4.
   (g) We show our slavery by serving men instead of God.
But thd Lord teaches that what we do for or in respect to others
we are to do "not with eyeservice, as men pleasers; but as the
servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; with
good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men." Eph.
6:6, 7.
   (h) Whosoever follows the commandments of men instead
of the commandments of God, is the servantof men instead of
the servant of God. This is vain worship, because it is 'Iran
worship. See Matt. 15 : 9; Isa. 29: 13; Titus r : 14.
   (i) Whoever commits sin is the servant, or slave, of sin, and
through sin of the devil, who is the originator and author of sin.
John 8 : 34; Rom. 6 : r6; 1 John 3 :8.
   4. THOUGH announced in an assumed hypothetical way, Paul
does, nevertheless, here express his freedom. He was "free
from all men." And his perfect freedom is further shown in the
expression which follows, "Yet have I made myself servant unto
all." This was voluntary. He made hi msetfservant. Let it be
noted, also, that this freedom which Christ gives, though making
men free from all men, does not make them unfeeling or ostenta-
tiously independent, but kind-hearted, sympathetic, and willing
and ready to do good to all.

People."



     LESSON M.—October 19, 1895.
         THE GENUINE PRINCIPLE OF LIBERTY.


    I. FOR what kind of rights and liberty may even selfish men
plead? Ans.—Their own rights and their own liberty.
    2. What kind of liberty did the Lord command the children
of Israel to proclaim at the year of jubilee? Ans.—Universal
liberty. Lev. 25 : 10. (See note 1.)
   3. How did He rebuke them for not heeding this instruction?
Jer. 34: 17.
   4. For whom had they not proclaimed liberty? Same verse.
(See note 2.)

    5. What judgments were pronounced upon them because of
this failure on their part? Same text.
    6. What does this show? Ans.—God's displeasure at men's
disregard for the rights of others, and that His judgments come
On account of these things.
    7. In what language did Job show his regard for the rights
of his servants? Job 31 : 13-15.
    8. Instead of serving ourselves all the while, what does the
Bible tell us to do? Phil. 2 :4.
    9. How are we to serve one another? Gal. 5 : 13.
   so. Are our love and good will to be confined simply to those
who reciprocate them? Matt. 5 : 43, 44; Gal. 6:10.
   11. If all men would love their enemies as well as their,
friends, how long could enemies, enmity, and persecution.
exist?
   12. What is the only principle which will lead men to treat
their neighbors as themselves? Lev. 19 : 18.
   13. What is said of love in Rom. 13 : io?
   14. What is love declared to be? Verses 8, io.
   15. What result does the keeping of the law bring to the in-
dividual himself? Ps. rig. : 44, 45. (See note 3.)
   16. Since the keeping of the law of God insures liberty both
to the individual himself and also to his neighbor, what is this
 law most fittingly called? James 2: 12. (See note 4.)
   17. But as this law can be fulfilled only by love, what is the
 fundamental principle of true liberty for all men?
                           NOTES.
  1. To proclaim liberty throughout all the land to all the in-
habitants thereof would be universal liberty. This was the
proclamation God ordered to go forth in Israel at the year of
jubilee, ordained to be celebrated every fifty years, when all
property was to revert back to its original owners, and all per-
sons held in servitude were to be free. This year of jubilee
was a type of the final deliverance of God's people and the
complete freedom which they will enjoy when they rise con-
querors over death and all wicked and opposing powers. See
"Early Writings," p. 28.
   2. IT is easy enough to proclaim liberty for ourselves. The
most selfish man in the world can do this. But to plead for the
10               CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.

rights of others—the rights of all men—that is quite a different
thing. That means true freedom.
                    "Is true freedom but to break
                     Fetters for our own dear sake,
                     And with leathern hearts forget
                     That we owe mankind a debt?
                     No; true freedom is to share
                      All the chains our brothers wear,
                     And, with heart and hand, to be
                     Earnest to make others free! "
                                                  —James Russell Lowell.
   God wants men to proclaim liberty "everywhere to his
brother, and every man to his neighbor." His denunciation for
a failure in this respect (as recorded in Jer. 34:17) shows not
only His displeasure at such a course, but that he sends His
judgments because men do not regard and plead for the rights
of their fellow-men. We are not to plead simply for our own
rights. This is why we cannot consistently ask for exemption
for ourselves from laws that are unjust to all. We are not to
ask to be treated better than our neighbors.
 _ 3. IT is true in civil government, as well as in the spiritual
realm, that obedience to law insures liberty to the individual.,
Under just administration it is only criminals, or law breakers,
who lose their liberty. But the keeping of the law means the
recognition of the rights of others, or liberty and freedom to
them as well as to ourselves. Therefore law keeping tends to
universal liberty, liberty for us and for our fellow-men. The
law of God is therefore most fittingly styled "the law of
liberty."
    4. MARK, we are not saying that sinful men obtain liberty-
before God by obedience to the law of God, but that the keeping
of this law (which is possible only by faith in Jesus Christ) in-
sures the liberty we speak of. Perfect liberty cannot be where
just laws are transgressed; that is impossible. And faith itself
could not bring about genuine liberty if it did not work obedi-
ence. But it does. We read of "the obedience of faith" (Rom.
16 : 26) and of "faith which works by love," which, as we have
already seen, is the fulfilling of the law (Gal. 5 :6; Rom. r3 :



       LESSON IV.—October 26, 1895.
            A THEOCRACY—TRUE AND FALSE.
     1. WHAT is a theocracy? (See note I.)
     2. Who, then, must be ruler or king in a true theocracy?

                             NOTES.
  1. "A THEOCRACY is (I) a government among men recognizing
the immediate sovereignty of God and receiving His revelations
as its civil law. (2) Hence a state of government administered
by a sacerdotal class or by ecclesiastics; a hierarchy having politi-
cal power; specifically, the Hebrew state from Moses to the
monarchy; by emphasis, a direct government of God."—
Standard Dictionary. The second definition covers false the-
ocracies.
   2. IT is an eternal and divine principle that "governments
derive their just powers from the consent of the governed." It
is only thus that God reigns over His people. He will not com-
pel unwilling service. It is the willing and obedient over whom
He reigns. There must therefore be in a true theocracy willing-
ness on the part of God to become king, and willingness on
the part of the people that the Lord should rule. Willing serv-
ice is always heart service. In its fullest and truest sense such
a theocracy never existed upon the earth save only the little
while that Adam and Eve were faithful.
  3. THE people of Israel promised to obey God's voice and
heed His command. Three days after this the Lord uttered His
               CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.                 13

voice from heaven in the ten words which comprehended
in themselves all righteousness. Then the Lord gave other
laws for the government of the nation through -Moses. These
are found in Ex. 20:22 to 23 : 33.
   "That the obligations of the Decalogue might be more fully
understood and enforced, additional precepts were given,
illustrating and applying the principles of the ten command-
ments. These laws are called judgments, both because they
were framed in infinite wisdom, and equity, and because the
magistrates were to give judgment according to them."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, ft. 350. "After the people had heard
these judgments from the lips of Moses, which were the condi-
tions of the covenant, they again said, 'All that the Lord hath
said will we do, and be obedient.' The covenant was then
ratified by the sprinkling of blood. Arrangements were now to
be made for the full establishment of the chosen nation under
Jehovah, their king."—Id., p. 312. This was done in the
erection of the sanctuary, the central place of worship, the
appointment of the priesthood, the endowment of the seventy
elders, etc. Israel thus became the kingdom of God.
   4. GOD was the governor of His people. His will or laws
were revealed to them in three different ways: (1) His great
constitution, or primal law of government of the universe by
 His own voice (see Ex. 20 : 1-17; Deut. 5 : 22); (2) through
 Moses, who talked with God face to face, and through other
 prophets (see Deut. 5 : 3o, 31; Num. 12:6; 2 Chron. 36 : 15);
 (3) by. Urim and Thummim, through the high priest (Num.
27 : 21), and sometimes other ways. But all these appoint-
 ments and agencies were of God. Moses, the elders, the
 priests, the prophets, were all appointed of God, or under His
 direction, and fitted for their work by His Spirit. Jehovah was
 king; the people of Israel, if the government was to be a suc-
 cess, must be willing subjects.
    5. As the leaders, prophets, and priests were but the min-
 isters of God, when the people neglected them or their coun-
 sels, they neglected not the men, but God, who sent them.
 See I Sam. 8 : 7; Ex. 16 :8; Luke to :16. This was a long step
 on the part of Israel toward the utter ruin of the kingdom.
 Henceforth the pure theocracy was no more. That the nation
 might be preserved intact, that the promise concerning Christ
 according to the flesh might be fulfilled through Abraham,
 Isaac, Jacob, Judah, David, the Lord preserved the nation
 even though rebellious till the coming and manifestation of
 Christ in the flesh. See Deut. 7 :6-8; 9 : 5; Gen. 49: 10; Jer.
11 :4, 5; Acts 2 :29, 30.
    6. AND yet the Lord did not cast off His people. He gave
14               CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.

 them their choice, and told them the manner of the kingdom.
 The king was to be chosen by the Lord and anointed by His
 prophet. When the Lord's choice was confirmed, it went well
with the nation. When the king was of their own choice, and
one who departed from God, the nation always suffered.
Special instruction concerning the king is found in Dent.
17 : 14-20. He was to be of God's choice; he was to be of the
stock of Israel; he must not multiply horses (an animal espe-
cially dedicated to sun worship); he must not follow the lustful
example of other rulers in multiplying to himself wives and
concubines. It was his "duty to write out a copy of, the law
given by Moses, and to study it, that he might ins.truct his
-people in word and example, and thus preserve the kingdom
 to the Lord.
   7. THE final result of choosing their own way, to that nation
which began its career so gloriously, was backsliding, extrava-
gance, oppression on the part of their kings, intermarriages
 with idolatrous nations, alliances with other nations, till, finally,
 that which was once the kingdom of the Lord became utterly
 perverted, and the king, who should have been a type of Christ,
was a mere vassal of Babylon. So of him, and of that king-
 dom which in a sense was still the Lord's, the prophet said:
 "And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is
 come, when iniquity shall have an end, thus saith the Lord
 God: Remove the diadem; and take off the crown; this shall
 not be the same; exalt him that is low, and abase him that is
 high. Perverted, perverted, perverted, will I make it; and it
shall be no more, until He come whose right it is; and I will
 give it Him." Eze. 21:25-27, margin. The crown of Judah
 was first seized by Babylon, in the very days of the prophet.
 Three times again it was " overturned, ' or "perverted,"by
 Medo-Persia, Grecia, Rome. It is in the hands of Rome and
 earthly governments to-day„and God will no more rule over
 an earthly kingdom; there will be no more a true theocracy
 or government of God on earth till Jesus Christ comes to reign
 as King of kings.
   8. As God has declared by His prophet that He will reign no
 more on earth over an earthly kingdom till Christ shall come
 the second time, it follows that that kingdom or government
 which claims to be ruling in the place of God is blasphemously
 assuming authority which does not belong to it. It is a false
 theocracy, the government of antichrist. And this has been
 the character in modified forms of every idolatrous or Church
 and State government which has ever existed apart from the
 theocracy of Israel. Behind them all is Satan. Their power is
 force. It is not, Do because you love and trust, but, Do be-
 cause you shall and must.

   . 9. THIS false theocracy began to be developed under the
 teachings of Augustine and others who had departed from the
 the faith. Says Neander (" History of the Christian Religion
 and Church," vol. 2, p. 132): "There had in fact arisen in the
 church, as we observed in the previous period, a false theo'-
'cratical theory. . 1 . This theocratical theory Was the pre-
 vailing one in the time of Constantine, and the bishops volun-
 tarily made themselves dependent on him by their disputeS-
 and by their determination to make use of the form of the State
 for the furtherance of their aims." It was out of this grew that
 " whole system of spiritual despotism, of intolerance and pers'e-
 cution, which ended in the tribunals of. the Inquisition." See
 Id., vol. 2, p. 217. The demand for a theocracy to-day by
 the National Reformers, the Woman's Christian Temperance
 Union, and others, is of precisely the same character, whether
 those who make it know it or not.
     10. IT may be said that the only true theocracy on earth now
 is Jesus Christ ruling supreme in the heart which4las admitted
 Him and retains Him by faith. Eph. 3 : 17; Gal. z : zo. The
 aggregation of such hearts form the temple or church of God,
 in which Jesus Christ rules by His word and Spirit (1 Cor. 3 : 16;
2 Cor. 6 : i6), and in which no other power has authority.
 When Christ shall come it will be such hearts—hearts tested in
 all trials—over which He will reign forever. Love will rule,
  love will do glad service forever; then let love rule now.

l6              CIVIL AND kl:LIC:101.•5

     7. When did he become " evil "? Ans.—When he sinned;
 when he transferred his allegiance from God to Satan.
    8. Since the rulers of civil governments were ordained to

 Ans.—Since the fall of man. (See note 2.)
    9. What did man lose in the fall that made civil governments
a necessity? Ans. —The power of self-control, the fear and love

  25. In contrast with these, what is the• kingdom of the Lord
called? 2 Peter I : to, 11.

                              NOTES.
   I. WE should not disparage the utility or importance of civil
governments. They are a necessity under the existing order of
things. They become a necessity in consequence of the fall.
To secure men in their persons and propel-1.y is a good object,
and, as) Lord Macaulay in his essay on Gladstone has said,
"The best way, indeed the only way of promoting that object
(among the masses of the people in a state of sin), is to com-
bine men together in certain great corporations, which are
called States." These States may be very imperfectly organ-
ized, and abound in abuses, yet, as Macaulay adds, "It seems
reasonable to believe that the worst that ever existed was, on
the whole, preferable to complete anarchy."
   "Some, I saw, have a prejudice against our rulers and laws;
but if it were not for law, this world would be in an awful con-
dition. God restrains our rulers; for the hearts of all are in
His hands. Bounds are set, beyond which they cannot go.
Many of the rulers are those whom Satan controls; but I saw
that God has His agents, even among the rulers. And some of
them will yet be converted to the truth. They are now acting
the part that God would have them."— Testimonies, vol. 1,
p. 203.
   2. ANDREW W. YOUNG, in his "Government Class Book,"
p. 12, explaining why civil governments are necessary, says:
 'Man is by nature selfish, and many would infringe the rights
of others, for their own selfish ends, unless restrained. Hence
we see the necessity of some fixed rules, that each one may
know what he may do and what he must not do. These rules
for regulating the social actions of men are called laws. . . .
But law cannot exist without government. Law is a rule of
action laid down • by the supreme power, and if there is no
supreme power there can be no law. Hence we see the neces-
sity of government."
   It will be noticed that the validity of this argument all rests
upon the statement that "man is by nature selfish." Civil
governments are a necessity, because men are selfish. But
God did not create man selfish. Selfishness is an evil acquired
through the fall, as shown in the three preceding lessons.
Hence civil governments are a necessity because of the fall.
Is              CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.

  3. LOVE and righteousness, it will be seen, are one and the
same thing; for righteousness is the keeping of God's right-
eous law (Deut. 6 : 25; Isa. 51:6, 7; Ps. 119: 172); and our lesson
teaches us that love is the same thing, manifesting itself in the
same way; love, or righteousness, is all-comprehensive. Every-
thing good goes with it,—obedience, life, peace, happiness.
True obedience springs from love. Love is the greatest thing
in the world. "Now abideth faith, hope, charity [love], these
three; but the greatest of these is charityve].'
                                             lo          Cor. 13 : I.
The means by which God places this in our hearts is through
faith in the gospel of Christ.
                  "I.ove is a golden chain that binds
                     The happy souls above,
                   And he's an heir of heaven who finds
                     His bosom glovx with love."
   4. TRUE Christians, while obedient to all just civil laws, are
governed by a higher and better law than these,—the law of
God, the law of love. They do not refrain from killing or ly-
ing or stealing or committing adultery because the laws of the
land make these things penal offenses, and threaten punishments
upon those who commit them. They would not do these things
if there were no civil laws or governments. It is not the fear
of the lock-up, the jail, the penitentiary, or the gallows that
keeps them from doing these things, but rather the fear of God.
With Joseph of old, they say, 'How can I do this great
wickedness, and sin against God." Gen. 39 : 9. While this
fear of God and love for His creatures controls the life of the
individual, he cannot do such things; he does not desire to do
them. "Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for
his seed remaineth in him; and he cannot sin, because he is
born of God." i John 3: 9.



     LESSON VI.—November 9, 1895.
                   CHRIST OUR FIASTER.

    I. WHAT does Christ style Himself in Matt. 23 : 8, 10?
    2. If He is Master, what are we? (See note I.)
   3. Has anyone a right to come in between a master and
his servant? Rom. 14 : 4.
   4. Therefore when men step in and begin to dictate to their
                CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.                   19

fellow-men how, when, where, or whom they shall worship,
what are they doing? Ans.—Putting themselves in the place of
Christ.
    5. Seeing' each individual in his relation to God is responsi-
ble alone to Him, what conclusion does Paul draw? Rom.
14 : 12.
    6. When the State makes religious laws and punishes men
for noncompliance therewith, to whom does it make them ac-
countable?
    7. What position does the State under such circumstances
assume toward the individual? Ans.—That of God.
    8. -Did -God ordain civil government to take His place 'in
religious things?
    9. What is religion? (See note 2.)
   ro. When a man becomes truly religious, what will he recog-
nize? Ans.—The relation he sustains toward God, and his
duties and obligations in consequence thereof.
    1. What has God done for man? Ans.,--Brought him back or
redeemed him from the service of self, sin, and Satan. I Peter
I : 18, 19.                           •
   12. Who are we then? 1 Cor. 6 : 19; Rom. 14:8.
   13. Whom shall we serve therefore? 1 Cor. 6 : 20; Rom.
12: 1;- Ezra 5 : 11.
   14. In religious things whom shall we not serve? r Cor. 7 : 23.
   15. How shall we regard rulers and those in authority? ITim.
2: I, 2; I Peter 2 : 13-17. (See note 3.)
   16, Why and how should we do this? I Peter 2:15,16. (See
same note.)
   17. What will the Master finally say to his faithful servants?
Matt. 25 : 21.

                           NOTES.
  I. THE complement of master is servant. Christ is the right-
ful Master, or Head, of every man; for He has paid the re-
demption price for every soul. It is therefore but a "reason-
able service" that we render obedience and loyalty to Him.
Rom. 12 : I, 2. But He forces none to serve Him; and recog-
nizes none as His servants but those who willingly offer them-
selves and take the freedom He purchased for them. Isa. I : 19;
Rev. 22 : 17.
20             CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.

   2. REL1GION—"The recognition of God as an object of wor-
ship, love, and obedience."—Webster. Another definition
quite as good is, "Man's relation of faith and obedience to
God."
   3. WHILE we are to regard Christ as our Master, we are to
treat our rulers with respect and recognize their authority ill
civil things, for they are divinely ordained to exercise such
authority. We are to do this, therefore, because it is the will
of God (verse 15), and we are to do this as the servants of God
(verse 16). This is the proper exercise of our liberty as God's
free men. There will be no conflict of authority unless men
and rulers undertake to exercise authority in religious matters,
and then "we ought to obey God rather than men." Acts
5: 29.
   This-is forcibly illustrated by memorable examples in Bible
history, such as Daniel, the three Hebrew children; the apos-
tles of Christ, and in later times by the martyrs of Jesus who
sealed their testimony with their blood. The words of the
apostle in Heb. II : 32-40 and 12: 1-3 should be a source of
strength and encouragement to God's remnant people, who are
soon to feel the dragon's wrath in the closing conflict of the
great controversy between Christ and Satan. Christ is our
Master; let us be loyal to him, and we shall surely be delivered
and stand at last upon Mount Zion. Rev. 14 : 1.



     LESSON V11.—November 16, 1895.
                   THE TWO REALMS.

    I. WHAT is vested in the king of any kingdom? Ans.—The
supreme power of that kingdom. Eccl. 8: 4.
    2. Who is suprenie in civil affairs? (See note 1.)
    3. Who is supreme in religious matters?
    4. What statement of Christ's shows that He distinctly
recognized these two realms? Matt. 22: 21.
    5. When men become Christians, or subjects of God's
kingdom (Rom. 6 : 22), does God require them to cease to
render to Cxsar those things which belong to Csar, and ren-
der them to Him? Ans.—No; the instruction given in Matt.
22 : 21 and Rom. 13 : 1-7 forbids this.
               CIVIL AND RCLICIIOLIS LIBERTY.                 21

    6. On the other hand, when men become citizens of another
State or civil government has the government a right to re-
quire them to render to it those things which belong to God?
Ans.—No; debts cannot be discharged in this way, by paying to
one what we owe to another.
    7. How many are commanded to be subject to the higher
powers? Rom. 13 :1.
   8. Does this include Christians?
    9. To whom are we commanded to render tribute? Verse 7.
  10. To whom is tribute due? Ans.—Caesar, or earthly rulers.
Why? Matt. 22:17, 21; Rom. 13 :4-6.
    I. To whom are we to render honor? Rom. 13 : 7.
  12. What is duty toward kings? 1 Peter 2 : 17. (See note 2.)
  13. To whom are we to pay the vows we have made to the
Lord? Ps. 5o : 14; 76 : It.
  14. To whom do the tithes belong? Ans.—The Lord. Lev.
27 : 3o.
  15. What infallible rule did the Saviour lay down by which
we are to be governed in determining to whom we are to render
any service or obligation? Mark 12 :17.
  16. How does Paul state the same principle? Rom. 13 : 7.
  17. In any case, therefore, what is the only question necessary
to be decided in order to know to whom an obligation of any
kind is to be rendered? Ans.—Whose is it? ' To whom does it
belong? See Matt. 22 : 20.
  18. Although commanded of God, why has not the State a
right to compel men to pay tithes?
  19. Prayer is likewise a duty enjoined in the Scriptures
(Luke IS : I; i Thess. 5 :17, 18; I Tim. 2 : 8); why has not the
State a right to command men to pray?
  20. Why not to be baptized, attend church, and partake of
the Lord's Supper? (See note 3.)
  21. Why has not the State a right to compel men to observe
the Sabbath? (See note 4.)
   22. Why has not the State the right to teach religion or to
perform any religious act or ceremony? (See note 5.)
 22               CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.

                               NOTES.
      1. IN i Peter 2 : 13, 14, Peter recognizes the king as "supreme"
   in the realm of earthly governments. And this realm is con-
   fined strictly to this world, to the ordinances of men, and the
   relations which they sustain to each other as citizens, which
   are civil. The ordinances of God belong to another realm. In
   this God is supreme, as Peter and the other apostles very
   plainly declared. See Acts 4 : 19; 5 : 29.
     2. 'WE are commanded not only to "honor the king," but
  to pray "for kings, and for all that are in authority." 1 Tim.
  2 : 1, .2. Acting in their sphere, they are "God's ministers"
  (Rom. r3: 4, 6), ordained by Him to promote peace among men
  by being a terror to evil doers, and a praise to them that do
  well, and we are to respect that which God has ordained.
     3. BAPTISM is religious. It is for the remission of sin, which
  is a transgression of God's law, and hence belongs to God.
  To Him it should be rendered. To attend church is likewise
- an act of religion, and -should therefore be rendered to God.
  The Lord's Supper, as its nature indicates, belongs to God,
  and this determines to whom it should be rendered. Any
  supper the State might command men to eat would be a State
  supper, and not the Lord's Supper at all.
     Civil governments have, however, interfered in all these
  matters. Justinian, in the year 533, issued a decree giving all
  men within the Roman Empire three months in which to be
  baptized and embrace Christianity, under pain of the loss of
  office, property, or the rights of inheritance. Bower's "History
  of the Popes,' vol. 2 , p. 334.
     The Sunday law of Charles 11., of England, enacted A. D.
  1677, and still in force in England and many of the English
  colonies, provides that,—
     "All the laws enacted and in force [in England] concerning
  the observation of the Lord's day and repairing- to the church
  therein be carefully put in execution."
     It further provides:—
     "That all and every person and persons whatsoever shall, on
 every Lord's day, apply themselves thereon in the duties of
 piety and true religion publiquely and privately."
     This would, of course, include the celebration of the Lord's
 Supper, prayer, and all other like duties.
     The Sunday law of Massachusetts, passed in 1782, says:—
     "That each person being able of body and not otherwise
 necessarily prevented, who shall for the space of one month
 together absent him or herself from the public worship of God
 on the Lord's day, shall forfeit and pay the sum of ten shillings,
 provided there be any place of worship in which they can con-
 scientiously and conveniently attend."
               CIVIL AND RELIC:IOUS LIBERTY.                 23

   The ancient Sunday law of Virginia, passed in 161o, was still
more strict in this respect. It reads as follows:—
   "Every man shall repair in the morning to the 'divine service
and sermons preached upon the Sabbath day, and in the after-
noon to divine service and catechising, upon pain for the first '
fault to lose their provision and the allowance for the whole
week following; for the second to lose the said allowance and
also to be whipt; and for the third to suffer death."
   4. WHOSE is the Sabbath? To whom does it belong? The
settlement of this question must determine to whom the keeping
if it is to be rendered, and therefore who alone has the right to
command its observance. The fourth commandment does not
say the seventh day is the English Sabbath, or the Dutch Sab-
bath, or the Puritan Sabbath, or "the holy Sabbath of America."
It says, "The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God."
Therefore, in accordance with the command of Jesus Christ, our
Saviour, to render to God the things that are God's, we are to
render atl our Sabbath observance to the Lord our God, to
whom the Sabbath belongs. The Sabbath is the Lord's own
day (Ex. 20:10; Isa. 58:13; Mark 2:28; Rev. t : to), and hence
should be rendered to Him. Were Sunday the Lord's day, as
many erroneously hold, the principle would apply just the same;
the keeping of it should be rendered to the Lord and not to
the State. Therefore, the State. has no business whatever with
the enforcement of any Sabbath keeping whatever.
   5. GOVERNMENTS were ordained to keep men civil, and not
to make them religious. While a thing may be admirably
adapted to meet certain ends; it may be wholly unsuited 'to ac-
complish certain other ends. Because civil governments,
through their laws and schools, do not make Christians, is no
more an occasion for just complaint than the fact that a bake
shop does not make pianos instead of loaves of bread. They
 were not established for that purpose.

  26. State in brief the results of a union of Church and State.
                             NOTES.
   1. "THE utmost that severity can do is to make men hypo-
crites; it can never make them converts. "— Dr. John Moore.
   2. FAITH cannot be forced, neither can the conscience be
guided or controlled by an appeal to arms. Any attempt,
therefore, to compel men who have the courage of their con-
victions to do differently from what they believe, must necessa-
rily result in persecution. It cannot result otherwise.
  3. LIKE everything else, when Church or State is turned from
its proper course, it is on the road to destruction. The truth is
well stated in the following words:—
   "When religion and civil government are legally united,
neither derives any benefit from the union; both are seriously
damaged by it. The most characteristic feature of such a union
is that of a bad religion and a bad government at the same time,
each being harmed by the other. "—Samuel 7'. Spear, D. D., in
Religion and the Slate.
   "Injustice and oppression are not made tolerable by being in
strict accordance with the law. Nothing is surer, in the end,
than the reaction of such a wronF, to break down the most per-
fectly constituted government."—Fairchild' s Moral Philosophy,
p. 186.
   "Secular power has proved a Satanic gift to the church, and
ecclesiastical power has proved an engine of tyranny in the
hands of the State."—Dr. Phillip Schaff.

suade men" (2 Cor. s : it); "We pray you" (verse 2o);"I beseech

2 Tim. 2 : 24-26.
  20. In seeking to convert men, how does God appeal to them?
Isa. 1 : 18. (See note 6.)

                           NOTES.
   I. FAITH is the gift of God, but it is ours to exercise. . God
leaves it optional with us whether we will use the faith, Me
gives. All the powers of earth have not sufficient power to
force a single soul to believe anything. If one believe-s it must
be through force of conviction from accepting certain testimony,
and not by outward constraint. Faith is voluntary...Its founda-
tion is the word of God (Rom. to :1.7); but no one can, by force,
compel another to believe the Bible (John q.: 17,
   "-Where legal enactment begins, moral suasion ,,ends."—
Christian Union.                   .
   "You must recollect that you can't make people good or reli-
gious by act of Parliament."—Sir George .Pibbs, Ex-Premier
of New South Wales.
   2. "ALMIGHTY GOD bath created the mind free; all attempts
to influence it by temporal punishments or burdens, or by civil
incapacitation, tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and mean-
ness, and are a departure from the plan of the holy Author of
our religion, who, being Lord both of body and mind, yet
chose not to propagate it by coercion on either, as was in his
power to do." — Thomas Jefferson.
   3. THE views of Luther on the subject of using force in reli-
gious work are clearly set forth in the following words:—
   "It is with the word we must contend, and, by the word we
must refute and expel what has gained a footing by violence.
 I would not resort to force against such as are superstitious,
 nor even against unbelievers. Whosoever believeth let him
draw nigh, and whoso believeth not stand afar off. Let there
 be no compulsion. Liberty is of the very essence of faith."
   4. VENGEANCE, or retributive justice, belongs to God to exe-
 cute and not to man, because all men are alike accountable to
 God for their conduct. Therefore we are not to become angry
 and avenge ourselves for the wrongdoings of others, but we
 are to "give place unto wrath," that is, God's wrath; for it is
28              mit- AND    kELIGIOUS 1,113liKTV.


written, "Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord." The
Vord's wrath will be visited in harmony with the principles of
justice, love, and righteousness. God has not committed to
men the work of judging, condemning, and executing ven-
geance upon anyone. The Papacy has often shown its anti-
christian character by engaging in such work.
  5. SHOULD anyone go to the house of another, and, without
knocking, bolt through the door and rush in uninvited, he
would be considered rude and unmannerly. Christ does not
so. He has too much respect for the rights of every individual
to force an entrance through the door of any human heart. He
stands without and knocks, and says if any man will hear and
open, He will come in. But, ah, how many professing to be fol-
lowers of Christ have rudely sought by force to break open the
door and rule men's hearts by human laws, and compel sub-
mission to church dogmas!
  6. "THE government of God is not as Satan would make it
appear, founded upon a blind submission, an unreasoning con-
trol. It appeals to the intellect and the conscience. 'Come
now, and let us reason together,' is the Creator's invitation to
the beings He has made. God does not force the will of His
creatures. He cannot accept an homage that is not willingly
and intelligently given. A mere forced submission would pre-
vent all development of mind or character; it would make
man a mere automaton. Such is not the purpose of the Creator.
He desires that man, the crowning work of His creative power,
shall reach the highest possible development. He sets before
us the height of blessing to which He desires to bring us,
through His grace. He invites us to give ourselves to Him,
that He may work His will in us. It remains for us to choose
whether we will be set free from the bondage of sin, to share
the glorious liberty of the sons of God."—Steps to Christ, _ft. 43.

themselves? Jer. 26 :14, 15; Matt. 23 :34, 35.
  27. Has God promised to vindicate His people? Luke
18 : 7, 8.

                           NOTES.
   I. PERSECUTE-" (1) To pursue in a manner to injure, vex,
or afflict; to cause to suffer pain from hatred or malignity; to
harass; to beset in an annoying way. (2) Especially to afflict,
harass, or punish for adherence to a particular creed or system
of religious principles, or to a mode of worship."—Webster.
The punishment of criminals through the enforcement of right
laws can never be persecution. To hang murderers or im-
prison thieves is not persecution. From the very nature of the
case, persecution implies an injustice done by one person to
another.
  2. THE love of God in the heart leads one to act like God.
Of Him we read that He makes His sun to "rise on the evil and
on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust."
Matt. 5 : 45. He is " longsuffering to usward, not willing that
any should perish, but that all should come to repentance."
2 Peter 3 : 9. Unlike the persecutor, He takes no pleasure in
the death of him that dieth. Eze. 18 : 32. He blesses all, He
loves all, and is patient and kind and long-suffering to all. His
true children will act in like manner. Christ commanded us
to do so, " that ye may be the children of your Father which
is in heaven." Matt. 5 :45.
  3. Tins is an important point. This text (Gal. 4 : 29) throws
great light on the subject of persecution. It shows who per-
secutes, and who are the persecuted. He that is born of the
flesh, f the carnal mind, which is not subject to the law of
God (Rom. 8 : 7), he it is that persecutes. His old, unrenewed,
selfish nature leads him to despise and treat with contempt and
violence those whose lives, by their purity and holiness, differ
from his life. Those who have been born ."again," "from
above" (John 3 : 1-7, margin), "after the Spirit," these will
bear the fruits of the Spirit, which are "love, joy, peace, long-
suffering," etc. (Gal. 5:22). These will not persecute. Viewe
from this standpoint, it is not difficult to see why the Saviour
told Nicodernus that, except a man was born of the Spirit, he
could not enter the kingdom of God.
   4. WHATEVER the circumstances may be, the persecutor
cannot be right, for persecution itself is wrong. Even though
the persecutor were defending the truth, his persecution would
               CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY':                   31

be wrong. Thomas Clarke, an English writer, has well said,
" There are many who do not seem to be sensible that all vio-
lence in religion is irreligious, and that, whoever is wrong, the
persecutor cannot be right."
  5. THIS text (t John 3 : 12) reveals the secret of all religious
persecution. The godly are a constant rebuke to the wicked.
Their refusal to conform to the ways of the ungodly, and espe-
dally those of the ungodly who make a religious profession, is
a standing challenge to the righteousness of the course of the
ungodly, which they cannot brook, and they naturally crave the
power either to force the godly to conform to that which they
cannot convince them of by facts, Scripture, or logic, having
none, or to put them out of their sight. A Catholic priest of
New Zealand spoke truly to his congregation when he said:
" If you would- read the word of God, you would find that from
the beginning all good people were persecuted because they
were good. .Abel was slain by his brother because he was
good, and Cain could not endure the sight of him."—Father
des Chesnais, in N. Z. Kaikoura Star, April lo, 1881.
   That is the reason Sunday keepers dislike and persecute
Sabbath keepers. Sabbath keeping is right, and those who
keep the Sabbath are a rebuke to those who keep Sunday.
"The Protestant world to-day see in the little company keep-
ing the Sabbath a Mordecai in the gate."— Testimony No. 32,
p. 206.
  That is the reason so many dislike the name Seventh-day
Adventist. It is a witness to the truth, and a rebuke to apos-
tasy 'and worldliness. It calls to mind the Creator and Re-
deemer, He who is the "Alpha and Omega" (Rev. 1 : II), the
"Beginning and Finisher of our faith" (Heb. 12 : 2, margin);
and, hence, those who do not like to retain God in their knowl-
edge (Rom. I :.28) are not favorably disposed toward the name.
" The name Seventh-day Adventist is a standing rebuke to the
Protestant world. "— Testimonies, vol. .1, p. 223.
  "God does not force the conscience of any man, but the
powers of darkness have been trying to compel the consciences
of men ever since Abel fell under the pitiless Cain, because
Abel's works were righteous and his own were sinful."—Mrs.
E. G. White, in Review, April 15,.1890.
   6. "PERSECUTION in its varied forms is the development of
a principle which will exist as long as Satan exists, and Chris-
tianity has vital power. No man can serve God without enlist-
ing against himself the opposition of the hosts of darkness.
Evil angels will assail him, alarmed that his influence is taking
the prey from their hands. Evil men, rebuked by his example,
will unite with them in seeking to separate him from God by
32              CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.

alluring temptations. When these do not succeed, then a com-
pelling power is, employed to force the conscience."—Greal
 Controversy, fi. 61o.
   "The Lord permits conflicts to prepare the soul for peace."
        fi. 633.
   "Let there be a revival of the faith and power of the early
church, and the spirit of persecution will be revived, and the
fires of persecution will be rekindled."—Id., p.   0.
   7. "WHEN the servants of Christ move actively through the
land to contend against prevailing errors and superstitions,
they are doing the work which the Lord has given them, stand-
ing in defense of the gospel, but when, through Satan's
malice, they are persecuted, their active labor hindered, and
they cast into prison, as was Paul, and finally dragged to the
scaffold or the stake, it is then that the truth gains a greater
triumph. Those who before doubted, are convinced of their
sincerity, as they thus seal their faith with their blood. From
the martyr's ashes springs an abundant harvest for the garner
of God. . . . It is in the darkness of affliction, bereavement,
trial, and persecution, that the light of Christian faith shines
brightest. . . . Patience as well as courage has its victories.
Converts may be made by meekness in 'trial no less than by
boldness in enterprise. If Christians would be reconciled to
the apparent suspension of their usefulness, and would cheer-
fully rest from the strife, and lay off the burden of labor, they
would learn sweet lessons at the feet of Jesus, and would see
that their Master is using them as effectively when they seem
to be withdrawn from employment as when in more active
labor."—Sketches from the Life of Paul, fifi. 293, 294.
   "Persecution, moreover, will never advance the cause that
pretends to defend. The ashes of the martyrs are the seed of
the Christian church."—Elector Frederick, in Wylie' s History
of the Waldenses, j5. 126.

  27. What religious Roman laws existed in the days of the
apostles? (See note 11.)
  28. What did the great commission which Christ gave to the
disciples require them to do? Ans.—Ignore these laws of
Cxsar.
  29. Why had they a right to do so? Ans.—Because the Lord
was first to he obeyed, and Csar had no right to make these
laws.
  30. In any case, therefore, of conflict between the laws of
men and the word of God, whom should we obey? Acts 4:19,
20; 5 : 29. (See note 12. )
  31. Mention the four exaniples in this lesson which show
that obedience to civil governments is limited to civil things.

                           NOTES.
  I. 'BEFORE there can be religious persecution there must be a
union of the civil and religious forces,—Church and State must
                CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.                    35

De united. The Church must get control of and use the power
of the State before she can punish those who dissent from her
doctrines, dogmas, and dictation.
   2. TOLERANT-" The act of enduring."
   Tolerate—" To suffer to be or to be done; to allow or permit
negatively, by not preventing."
   Toleration—" The allowance of that which is not wholly
approved. Specifically, when contrary to or different from
those of the established church or belief."—Webster.
   3. OVER the colonnades fronting the lake shore at the Chicago
World's Fair, of 1893, was this motto, " Religious toleration
the best fruits of the last four centuries." If this be true, then
the fruits of these centuries have not been the best, for religious
liberty is a long way ahead of religious toleration. Toleration°
is freedom recognized, not as a right, but as a favor. Tolera-
tion implies: —
   (a) An established religion. It means that some religion is
the favored religion, and that all others are heretical an dis-
approved, but permitted. Wherever there is an established
religion the only thing the State can do, aside from persecuting,
is to tolerate. This is why so many English writers talk about
toleration instead of liberty. England has an established re-
ligion.
   (b) Toleration implies the right of the State to dictate in mat-
ters of religion.
   (c) It means the allowing of that which is not approved or
liked, as a matter of sufferance or endurance.
   (d) It implies the right to prohibit. The right to permit
implies the right to prohibit. And the right to permit and
prohibit implies the right, also, to compel. The right of the
parent to say to the child, " You may go," and, " You must
not go," implies the right to say, "You must go." If the State
has a right to say to its citizens, " You may work on Sunday,"
it has the right to say, "You must not work on Sunday." And
if it has the right to say these, it has also the right to say, "You
must work on the Sabbath."
   " There is a very great difference between toleration and lib-
erty. Toleration is a concession which may be withdrawn. It
implies a preference for the ruling form of faith and worship,
and a practical disapproval of all other forms."—Schaff' s
Church and State in the United States, p.
   " The free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of
conscience, is something which every man may indeed demand
as a right, not something for which we must ask a privilege.
To grant to the State the power of tolerating is implicitly to
grant to it the power of prohibiting."—Appleton' s Cyclopedia
of American Biography, vol. p. 165.
36              CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.


    " Toleration denotes neither the freedom of religion from
 State control, nor the equality of all religions before the law.
 Toleration is the allowance of that which is not wholly ap-
 proved. Religious liberty, on the other hand, is absolute free-
 dom of religious opinion and worship."—Thomfison's Church
 and Slate in the United Slates, p. 12.
    " What other nations call toleration we call religious rights.
 They are not exercised in virtue of governmental indulgence,
 but as rights, of which government cannot deprive any portion
 of citizens, however small. Despotic power may invade those
 rights, but justice still confirms them."—U.S. Senate Report,
1829.
    4. To ask the State to allow us to work on Sunday is virtu-
° ally to concede to it the right to dictate in the matter. To be
 consistent we should abide by its decision, whether favorable
 or otherwise, else why should we ask? In the fourth com-
 rnandment God has told us what to do on all days of the week,
 and that should settle the question for all men and for all time.
 The fact is, the State has not the allowing to do in the matter.
 It might just as consistently be asked to allow us to breathe or
 eat or walk or sleep as to allow us to work. To labor at honest
 toil is a natural right, and, whenever done, cannot justly be
 deemed a crime.
    "The time was when toleration was craved by dissenters as
 a boon. It is now demanded as a right; but a time will come
 when it will be spurned as an insult."—Lord Stanhope, in House
 of Lords, in 1827.
    5. To give to men their natural rights is not in the power or
  province of the State. It has no such rights to give. Rights
  come from God. The Michigan Sabbath Watchman, of June,
  1892, failed to comprehend this when it said: " The only legal
  right the Seventh-day Adventists have to do secular work in
  shop, in house, in field, or to run their presses, etc., in their
  publishing concern on the. Christian sabbath, is a right given
 them by this Slate on religious grounds only."
    6. "To protect liberty of conscience is the duty of the State,
  and this is the limit of its authority in matters of religion."—
  Great Controversy, P. 201.
     " Government exists for the protection of the persons and
  property of men."—Macaulay on Mills' Essay on Government.
     7. MACAULAY, in his essay on Gladstone, well said, " Have
  not almost all the governments in the world always been in the
  wrong on religious subjects?" Indeed they have, and for the
  simple reason that they are controlled by. majorities, and the
  majority are almost always wrong on religious subjects. They
               CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.                   37

are wrong on the subject of the Sabbath, and this manifests
itself wherever governments legislate on the question. They
favor and defend the Sunday, the papal sabbath, and not the
seventh day, the Sabbath of the Lord.
   8. To say that because we are told to be subject to the higher
powers we are therefore bound to obey every law that men
may make, would imply that if the State commanded men to
murder, they would have to do it; or to steal, they would have
to steal; or to lie, swear, dishonor parents, or worship idols,
they would have to do all these things. Every person knows
better than this. It is evident, therefore, that there must be
some limit to human legislation and the duties which men owe
to civil governments.
   9. ANARCHY iS a disregard for all law. To disregard unjust
laws that transcend the rights of conscience is not anarchy.
The most loyal and patriotic can do this. Neither is it resisting
the powers that be to disregard such laws. The resistance
spoken of in Rom. 13 : 2 is a rising up against, or a resort to
forceful means. This no Christian will do. He will firmly
 refuse to comply with laws that violate his conscience, and
submit to whatever consequences such a course may entail.
 "Christ's embassadors have nothing to do with consequences."
—Great Controversy, p. 6o9.
  "Conscientious men are not the enemies but the friends of
any government but a tyranny. They are its strength and not
its weakness. Daniel, in Babylon, praying, contrary to the
law, was the true friend and supporter of the government;
while those who, in their pretended zeal for the law and the
constitution, would strike down the good man, were its real
enemies. It is only when government transcends its sphere
that it comes in contact with the consciences of men."—Fair-
child's Moral Philosophy, P. 185.
   10. THE argument of Daniel's persecutors is a familiar one to
the people of all ages. They secure the unjust measures they
desire, and then demand submission and obedience to these
measures because they are the law. "We ask only obedience
to law," is the favorite motto with the advocates of Sunday
enforcement. Of course that is all they ask after they get the
law they want; but we deny the right of the existence of the
law. -
  11. THE following was Roman law in the time of the apos-
lles:--
   "Worship the gods in all respects according to the laws of
your country, and compel all others to do the same. But hate
38               CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.


and punish those who would introduce anything alien to our
customs in this particular.
   "Whoever introduces new religions, the tendency and char-
acter of which are unknown, whereby the minds of men be
disturbed, shall, if belonging to the higher rank, be banished;
if to the lower, punished with death."—Neander, Church His-
tory, vol. 1, sec. ',part r, div. 3, par. 2.
  12. "WHEN the laws of men conflict with the word and law
of God, we are to obey the latter, whatever the consequences
may be."— Testimonies to the Church, vol. z, pp. 201, 202.
  'It is too obvious to need discussion that the law of God,
the great principle of benevolence, is supreme, and that. 'we
ought to obey God rather than men' in any case of conflict
between the human law and the divine."—Fairchild's Moral
Philosophy, fi.r78.
  "It is the duty of every man to render to the Creator such
homage, and such only, as he believes to be acceptable to Him.
This duty is precedent, both in order of time and in degree of
obligation, to the claims of civil society. Before any man can
be considered a member of civil society, he must be considered
as a subject of the Governor of the universe. "—Madison's Me-
morial and Remonstrance, State Papers, p. 29.
  "The question is asked, Shall we not obey the powers that
be?—Yes, when they are in harmony with the higher powers
that be. God made His law for all the universe. He created
man; He gives the bounteous provisions of nature, holds our
breath and life in His hand. He is to be recognized, His law
honored, before all the great men and the highest earthly
powers."—Mrs. E. G. While, in Review and Herald, April
15, 189o.
  "The framers of the U. S. Constitution recognized the eter-
nal principle that man's relation with his God is above human
legislation, and his rights of conscience inalienable. Reason-
ing was not necessary to establish this truth; we are conscious
of it in our own bosoms. It is this conscientiousness which, in
defiance of human laws, has sustained so many martyrs in tor-
tures and in flames. They felt that their duty to God was
superior to human enactments, and that man could exercise no
authority over their consciences. It is an inborn principle
which nothing can eradicate. The bigot, in the pride of his
authority, may lose sight of it; but strip him of his power, pre-
scribe a faith to him which his conscience rejects, threaten him
in turn with the dungeon and the fagot, and the spirit which
God has implanted in him rises up in rebellion, and defies
you."—U. S. Senate Report, 1829.

   LESSON X11.—December 21, 1895.
                       SUNDAY LAWS.

                   ORIGIN AND EARLY HISTORY. •
    I. BY whom and when was the first Sunday law on record
made? Ans. —By Constantine, A. D. 321. (See note 1.)
    2. By whom and when were the so-called Christian church
and Roman State united? (See note 2.)
    3. By what means was this largely effected? (See note 3.)
                           THEIR OBJECT.
    4. What is Satan's object in securing Sunday laws? (See
note 4.)
    5. Who have been instrumental in securing them? (See
note 5.)
    6. What does this show? Ans.—That such laws are reli-
°ions in their nature.
    7. What is the expressed design of those who advocate
Sunday laws? (See note 6.)
    8. For what were civil governments ordained? Ans.—To pro-
tect the rights of men, and not to protect religious institutions.
                          THEIR RESULTS.
    9. What is the Sunday institution? Ans.—The mark of
papal power and apostasy, the mark of the beast.
   10. What do Sunday laws, therefore, enforce?
   Ir. Where is this mark to be received? Rev. 13 : 16.
  12. What would the hand naturally symbolize? Ans. —Labor.
See i Cora 4 : I2; Eph. 4 :28. What would be represented by
the forehead? Ans.—The mind. See Rom. 7 : 25.
  13. Where will those receive the mark of the beast, there-
fore, who cease to work on Sunday simply in deference to,the
law?
  14: Where will those receive it who, knowing its origin, con-
tinue to observe it as a religious institution?
   15. Is it not significant, therefore, that the Sunday institution
has taken on its "civil" and "religious" aspect? (See note 7.)
40              CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.


                       THE FINAL ISSUE.
  16. Why may we not obey a Sunday law and yet observe the
Sabbath? (See note 8.)
  17. How many days in the week does God give us for labor?
Ex. 20 : 9.
  18. Can a man work six days a week and keep two Sabbaths?
Can he serve two masters? Matt. 6 : 24.
  19. To what will the final issue be brought? (See note 9,)
  20. To what will the prohibition against keeping the Sabbath
he a parallel? Dan. 6 : 4-9.
  21. How did Daniel conduct himself after he knew that the
decree was signed? Verse 10.
  22. For what purpose was his case, also that of the three
Hebrews, written? 1 Cor. 10: 11; Rom. 15 :4.

                             NOTES.
   I. "LET all the judges and townspeople, and the occupation
of all trades, rest on the venerable day of the sun; but let those
who are situated in the country, freely, and at full iberty, attend
to the business of agriculture; because it often happens that no
other day is so fit for sowing corn and planting vines; lest the
critical moment being let slip, men should lose the commodi-
ties granted of heaven."—Scluzff' s Church History, vol. 2, chap.
3, P. 105.-
   2. CHURCH and State were united under Constantine, in the
early part of the fourth century. Says Draper:—
   "It was the aim of Constantine to make theology a branch of
politics; it was the hope of every bishop in the empire to make
politics a branch of theology." "The unavoidable conse-
quences were a union between the Church and State."—Intellec-
tual Development of Europe, chapters 9 and so.
  3. REFERRING to Sunday legislation, Neander says:—
   "In this way the Church received help from the State for the
furtherance of her ends."—Neander' s History of the Christian
Church (edition 1852), vol. 2, P. 300.
   Speaking of Constantine, the American Sabbath Union, in
its Pearl of Day Leaflets, No. 3, says:—
   "He was inclined—whether from policy or conviction is not
material to our argument—to favor Christianity, and to make it
the prominent religion of his empire, and one step toward this
was to recognize the day which he found universally(?) ob-
served by Christians, as the day of rest for his people."—P. 12.
               CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERT v.                 41

   4. SATAN'S object in securing Sunday laws is to cause men to
honor Sunday in the place of the Sabbath—to obscure from their
minds a knowledge of the true God by blotting out His great
memorial of the manifestations of His creative power, and to
keep alive that form of religion of which the Sunday sabbath is
the sign, or mark, which is idolatry.
   "Not a move has been made in exalting• the idol sabbath in
bringing around Sunday observance through legislation, but
Satan has been behind it, and has been the chief worker."
   "No law has ever been made to exalt the idol sabbath but
that Satan has taken a leading part in its enactment and its en-
forcement. Every law for the elevation of Sunday has a direct
reference to the fourth commandment. Every move that has
been made to enforce its observance is for the purpose of exalt-,
ing the man of sin above God and above all that is worshiped."
—AA's. E. G. White, in Review and Herald, April 15 and 29,
1890.
   5. FROM the first, church leaders have been instrumental in
securing Sunday laws. The following admission states the
truth: "During nearly all our American history the churches
 have influenced the States to make and improve Sabbath laws."
—IP. F. Crafts, in Christian Statesman, July 3,1890.
   6. ONE of the chief arguments against the States allowing
 Sunday labor, Sunday newspapers, Sunday excursions, and
 various other kinds of amusements on that day, is that they keep
 people away from the churches. Thus:—
   "It is but too true that the sanctuary of worship is neglected
 by a large number of young men. Not only God's word but
the means of grace are despised, while excursion trains and
 steamboats are thronged on the Lord's day. We must warn
 both old and young against the sin of sabbath desecration, and
 use our influence to have laws passed that will purge the body
 politic from all festering evils."—Melbourne Presbyterian
 Monthly, Feb. 1,1894.
   "The Sunday newspaper is tempting hundreds and thousands
 to stay away from the sanctuary."—/ M. Foster, in Christian
 Statesman, March 27, 1889.
• "The Sunday train is another great evil. They cannot afford
 to run a train unless they get a great many passengers, and Si)
 break up a great many congregations."— W. W. Evarts, at
 Elgin (El.), Sunday-law Convention, Nov. 8, 1887.
    ''Give us good Sunday laws, well enforced by men in local
 authority, and our churches will he full of worshipers,. and our
 young men and young women will be attracted to the divine
 service."—Homiletic Review, Nov. , -1892;
    In contrast with this we say:—
42              CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.

  "The conscience should not be compelled even for the ob-
servance of the genuine Sabbath, for God will accept only will-
ing service."—Nrs. E. G. While, in Review and Herald, April
15,1890.
   7. THE Sabbath of the Lord is religious and religious wholly,
and requires only the law of God, which is spiritual, for its sup-
port. Roni. 7: 14. Being the seal of God, it can be received
only in the forehead (Rev. 7 : i-4; Eze. 9 : 4), where the mind
resides, with which we serve the law of God. Rom. 7 : 25.
But the mark of the beast can be received in either the fore-
head or the hand. It is not a little significant, therefore, that
the Sunday sabbath, which is this mark, takes on this twofold
aspect of 'civil " and "religious," and requires not only the
/dogma of the church, but the law of the State for its support.
Like Caiphas of old John it :49-52), Mr. Crafts     . spoke more
prophetically than he knew when he said:—
   "We, the Sabbath Union, W. C. T. U., all the churches, and
the Y. M. C. A., are laboring with all our might to carry the re-
ligious sabbath with our right arm, and the civil sabbath with
our left. Hundreds of thousands will receive it as a religious
institution, and all the rest will receive it as a civil institution,
and thus we will sweep in the whole nation."—IV. F. Crafts,
in Sunday Union Convention, at Wichita, Kan., Sept. ao, 1889.
  8. IT is frequently said that Sunday laws do not interfere with
the keeping of any other day that one may choose to observe.
This is a specious argument. Sunday laws do interfere with
Sabbath keeping, for, as no man can serve two masters, neither
can he at the same time keep the sabbaths of two different and
opposing powers. He cannot have the seal of God and receive
the mark of the beast at the same time. The enemies of
three Hebrews might have said the same to them: "This de-
cree to fall down and worship the image does not prohibit you
from worshiping any other god you choose to worship. Your
liberty is not interfered with in the least." But it was. They
could not worship idols and the true God at the same time.
They could not worship idols and keep the second command-
ment. Neither can a person observe Sunday and keep the
fourth commandment. To attempt to do so shows lack of
intelligent faith.
  "The churches that were under the rule of the Papacy were
early compelled to honor the Sunday as a holy day. Amid the
prevailing error and superstition, many, even the true people
of God, became so bewildered that, while they observed the
Sabbath, they refrained from labor on the Sunday. But this
did not satisfy the papal leaders. They demanded not only
that Sunday he hallowed, but that the Sabbath be profaned."
—Great Controversy, p.
            . CIVIL AND It8LIGWCI; LIi3ERTV.                 43

  "In this situation worldly policy will urge an outward compli-
ance with the laws of the land, for the sake of peace and liar-
mony."— Testimony 33,P. 240.
  9. SATAN would not be content with the'keeping of two days,
could that he done. The Sabbath must be given up. He is a
usurper, and so is his sabbath. Every Sunday law has refer-
ence to the fourth commandment, and the displacement of the
Lord's Sabbath. And hence the final issue will be brought to
this:—.
  "The decree will go forth that they must disregard the Sab-
bath of the fourth commandment, And honor the first clay, or •
lose their lives.— Testimonies, vol. z, pp. 353, 354•
  "The decree which is to go forth against the people of God
will be very similar to that issued by Ahasuerus against the
Jews in the time of Esther."— Testimony No. 32, fi. 206.
   "I saw a writing, copies of which were scattered in different
parts of the land, giving orders ,that unless the saints should
yield their peculiar faith, give up the Sabbath, and observe the
first day of the week, the people were at liberty, after a certain
time, to put them to death."—Early Writings, p. 143.



   LESSON XI11.—December 28, 1895.
                  TRUE PROTESTANTISMI.

                        WHEN IT AROSE.
   I. FROM what does the word " Protestantism" come? Ans.
—The word "protest."
   2. What is the meaning of the word " protest "? Ans.
—" To affirm in a public or formal manner; to declare sol-
errinly; to make a solemn declaration expressive of opposi-
tion."— Webster.
   3. When did Protestantism arise? Ans.—In the early part
of the sixteenth century.   .
    4. Against what did the Protestants protest? Ans.—The
assumed right of the Church to use the power of the State, and
the multitude of abuses growing out of it,—against a union of
Church and State.
44             CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.


   5. In what language did the Christian princes of Germany
couch their famous protest? (See note t.)
   6. What did they further say? Ans.—" Let us reject this
decree. In matters of conscience the majority has no power."
—D' Aubigne's History of the Reformation, book .13,
   7. What has been truthfully said of this protest? (See note 2.)
                    UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLES.

    8. Are these principles in harmony with the course pursued
by the apostles and the teachings .of Christ? Acts 4 : 19; 5 : 29;
Matt. 22 : 21.    •
    9. Is the union of Church and State wrong simply when the
Romish Church is united to the State, or is it wrung in prin-
ciple?
  10. Do the same principles inhere and the same evils result
when any other church or religion is united to the State? (See
note 3.)
   11. Have other churches persecuted when they sought and
gained control of the power of the State? (See same note.)
  12. Therefore, what is it to be a true Protestant? Ans.—To
protest against the union of Church and State on principle, and
the workings of it wherever found.
         WHO   ASK AND WHO REFUSE STATE SUPPORT.

  13. What is a noteworthy fact? Ans.—That those who have
the truth do not feel the need nor ask for the assistance of State
laws in support of the doctrines they preach.
  14. Do Baptists ask for a law enforcing baptism, or the Dis-
ciples a law enforcing the Lord's Supper, or the Seventh-day
Adventists a law enforcing the observance of the seventh day?
  15.• Why do such not feel the need of State laws in these
matters? Ans.—Because they find a plain "Thus saith the
 Lord" in the Bible for all these, and that is sufficient..
  16. Who is it, then, that calls for aid of the State? (See
note 4.)
   17. On which side of the controversy, therefore, do true
 Protestants naturally stand? Ans.-Cln the side of God's word.

                   PROTESTANT APOSTASY.
18. What do the Scriptures say in regard to the professed
Christian world in the last clays? 2 Tim. 3 : 1-5; Rev. 14 : 8;
18 : I, 2.
   19. What position will the Papacy then hold, and how will
it be regarded? Rev. 13 : 3, S.
   20. When Romanism and apostate Protestantism so far unite
as to constitute the great Babylon of Rev. IS : 1-8, what warn-
ing is due? Verse 4.
   21. How will Babylon regard her condition then? Rev. 18 : 7.
   22.. Why do not the Protestant churches see what the Papacy
is aiming at? (See note 5.)
   23. What do the people need? (See note 6.)
   24. And what is this? Ans.—The warning of the Third
Angel's Message, the closing work of the "everlasting gospel"
 to men. Rev. 14 : 6-10.

                           NOTES.
   I. " WE protest by these presents, before God, who will one
day be our Judge, as well as before all men and all creatures,
that we, for us and for our people, neither consent nor adhere
in any manner whatsoever to the proposed decree, in anything
that is contrary to God, to his holy word, to our right con-
science, to the salvation of our souls, and to the last decree of
Spires." " We cannot assert that when Almighty God calls a
man to his knowledge, he dare not embrace that divine knowl-
edge." " We reject the yoke that is imposed on us."—D'Au-
bigne's Histbry of the Reformation, book 13.
   2. " ONE of the noblest testimonies ever uttered for the Ref-
ormation was the protest offered by the Christian princes of
Germany at the Diet of Spires, in 1529. The courage, faith,
and firmness of those men of God gained for succeeding ages
 liberty of thought and conscience. Their protest gave to the
 reformed church the name of Protestant; its principles are the
 very essence of Protestantism."— Great Controversy, p. 197.
   3. WHENEVER Church and State have been united, persecu-
 tion has resulted, regardless of what church and State were
 united. The heathen religion united to the Babylonian and
 Mello-Persian Governments persecuted Daniel and the three
 Hebrews, and finally planned to destroy God's peonle entirely
  by one fell stroke. And' thus it has been with the Roman
46             CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.

Church, the Greek Church, the English Church, the Scotch
Church, and every other church established by law. Canon
Potter, English prelate of Melbourne, makes the following ad-
mission:—
   "It is quite true that systematized persecution of .religious
opinion was no monopoly of the Romish Church. It is a mis-
erable fact that from the fourth to the eighteenth centuries it
was the rule everywhere throughout Christendom to inflict
the penalties of banishment and fine and death on those who
openly differed from the prevailing form of religion. We of
the, Church of England confess with sorrow that our church
has been guilty of persecution, and did wrong to persecute."
—Melbourne Argus, May r3, 1895.
   4. THE men who defend those institutions which are not
founded on God's word are the ones who call for State legis-
lation. The lack of divine command is supplied by oppressive
enactments.
   " God never forces the will or the conscience, but Satan will
employ the most cruel measures to control the consciences of
men, and to secure worship to himself. And this work of
compulsion is always in favor of human creeds and laws, and
in defiance of God's holy law."—Great Controversy (old edi-
tion),15. 40.
   5. "THE Protestant churches are in great darkness, or they
 would discern the signs of the times. The Roman Church is
far-reaching in her plans and modes of operation. She is em-
 ploying every device to extend her influence and increase her
 power in preparation for a fierce and determined conflict to
 regain control of the world, to reestablish persecution, and to
 undo all that 'Protestantism has done."—Great Controversy,
P. 565.
  " In the last conflict, the Sabbath will be the special point of
controversy throughout all Christendom. Secular rulers and
religious leaders will unite to enforce the observance of Sunday;
and as milder measures fail, the most oppressive laws will be
enacted. . . . Romanism in the Old World, and apostate
Protestantism in the New, will pursue a similar course toward
those who honor the divine precepts."—Great Controversy, old
edition, pp. 04,115.
  6. " MEN are closing their eyes to the real character of Ro-
manism, and the dangers to be apprehended from her suprem-
acy. The people need to be aroused to resist the advances of
this most dangerous foe to civil and religious liberty."—Great
 Controversy, ft. 566.
   "While the Protestant world is by her attitude making con-
                  CIVIL AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.                               47

cessions to Rome, let us arouse to comprehend the situation,
and view the contest before us in its true bearings. Let the
watchmen now lift up their voices, and give the message which
is present truth for this time. Let us show the people where
we are in prophetic history, and seek to arouse the spirit of
true Protestantism, awaking the world to a sense of the value
of the privileges of religious liberty so long enjoyed."— Testi-
mony 33, p. 2q.

                      •
         "God give us men! A time like this demands
          Great hearts, strong minds, true faith, and willing hands;
          Men whom the lust of office does not kill;
            Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy;
          Men who possess opinions and a will.
            Men who have honor, men who will not lie;
          For while the rabble, with their thumb-worn creeds,
          Their large professions and their little deeds,
          Wrangle in selfish strife—lo! Freedom weeps,
          Wrong rules the land, and waiting Justice sleeps."
