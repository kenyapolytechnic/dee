         INTRODUCTORY NOTE-
  THERE is no more important question ,Agitating the
world to-day than the question of the Sabbath. It is not
a mere question of a certain twenty-four hours of the week,
but in the question of the Sabbath is involved the worship
of the one true God, the power and authority of Christ
Jesus our Lord, and our own salvation. The subject can-
not. be too thoroughly studied nor too well understood.
Other styles of presenting the lesson have suggested them-
selves, but it is thought best to follow largely the familiar
topical lesson of the past. The student cannot be too ear-
nestly urged to do faithful work. in the study of the lessons.
It matters not though he may be in a general way familiar
with the subject of the Sabbath; he needs to be more than
that. He needs to know it in all its various phases, that he
may meet the assaults of error. He needs to know Him
who is Lord of the Sabbath, and whose power to regenerate
and save, the Sabbath commemorates. He needs to know
the blessing pronounced upon those, whoever they may be
(for God is no respecter of persons), who take hold of God's
covenant and keep the Sabbath from polluting it. There-
fore, become familiar with all the lesson texts as early in
the week as possible. Talk them over with others, pray
over them, meditate upon them, consider what the Lord
says, and "the Lord give thee understanding in all things."

Rev. 1:10. '

                              NOTES.
   1. On the Seventh Day God Ended His Work.—The Septuagint,
Syriac, and the Samaritan versions read, " On the sixth day God
ended His work which He had made; and He rested on the sev-
enth day," "and this," says Adam Clarke, " should be considered
the genuine reading." God's work of creation was complete at
the close of the sixth day, when He pronounced it " very good.''
See Ex. 20:11.
   2. MARK the three distinct acts or steps by which the Creator
founded the Sabbath,—His rest, blessing, and sanctification. God
does not do unnecessary things. His power is manifest toward us
" in all wisdom and prudence " (Eph. 1 : 8), and, therefore, all
these three things were necessary in instituting the Sabbath. In
every step is a lesson and blessing for man.
   3. THE day on which God rested is the seventh day of the cycle
of seven days, or of the week. See Matt. 28: 1. It is solely
through the appointment of the Sabbath that the week has come
down to us. The year is marked by the apparent revolution of
the heavenly bodies. The month is marked by the revolution of
the moon. The day is marked by the apparent revolution of the
sun around the earth, but the week rests wholly on what seems to
man's unaided understanding to be God's arbitrary appointment
                            THE SABBATH.                               5

of the Sabbath. It therefore demands faith on the part of man
to accept it, while absolute want of faith, as did infidel France,
rejects it.
   4. GOD'S blessing means something. He told Abraham, " I
will bless thee,       . . and thou shalt be a blessing ;" and this
blessing extended to all the families of the earth. Gen. 12: 2, 3.
So God through Isaac blessed Jacob. and even though Isaac would
order otherwise, His testimony concerning that blessing was, " Yea,
and he shall be blessed." God's blessing always lifts the elan who
is blessed above all other men of the same class. It is just so as
regards days. The seventh day was exalted above the other days
of the week. It was blessed that it might be a blessing.
   5. " SANCTIFY " comes from the Hebrew word qadesk, pro-
nounced kawdash. It means to " separate," " set apart," or
" appoint." Thus we read in Joshua 20 : 7 that there was " ap-
pointed (margin, " sanctified ") certain cities for cities of refuge.
That is, these cities were separated from the other cities of Israel,
and "appointed," or " set apart," to a certain use. In 2 Kings
10 : 20 we read, " Jelin said, Proclaim [literally, "sanctify,"
margin] a solemn assembly for Baal." Joel 1 : 14 reads, " Sanc-
tify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly," etc. . That is, "appoint,"
or " set apart," a fast. See also Ex. 19 : 12, 23. The sanctifi-
cation of the seventh day; therefore; necessarily involved the sep-
arating of that day from others, the setting of it apart for a special
use, and proclaiming that it should be so observed.
   6. GOD sanctifies, or separates, a place or thing in the fullest sense
when He puts within it, His own presence or Spirit.. He makes
men holy by His indwelling presence. 1 Cor. 0 : 11, 19. He
made Mount Sinai holy by coming clown upon it. Ex. 19 : 10-12.
See also Josh. 5: 15; Ex. 3: 5, 6. So God blessed the seventh
clay by placing within it, in a special sense above other days, His
own presence. He who has Christ within, and understands His
 rill ; n i11 recognize Christ's presence in the Sabbath.
   7. GOD did not bless and sanctify the particular day on which
 He rested. It is not the dead past which is sacred to God. It
was after the Creator had rested that He placed ills blessing and
sanctification upon the day, He therefore blessed and sanctified
6                              T II E SABBATII

the seventh day of the weekly cycle for all time to conic," because
that in it He had rested."
  8. GOD created the earth for man. He set apart the seventh
day as a memorial of that work, and, as creation pertained to the
earth, and the earth was created for the entire race, so the Sabbath
must have been made for the entire race. It would be incon-
gruous and illogical to consider it otherwise.

                             NOTES.
   1. Cif:olive Power.—Jellovah is the true God, therefore He is
the only God. He is the living God, therefore will always exist.
In the very nature of things He therefore becomes an "everlasting
King." Creative power is the great distinguishing characteristic
of the true God. All things exist in Him; hence, when He speaks,
things are. He takes the things that are not to bring to nothing
things that are. He therefore can never be defeated, because He
has in this all-creative power that which will overcome all opp.o-
sition. Hence, whenever this Godhead is pointed out, or is con-
trasted with false gods, His creative power is the distinguishing
characteristic. See Ps. 96 : 5; 115: 1-15. See also Paul's preach-
ing before the heathen. Acts 14 15; 17 22-25.
   2. God's Delight.—The Scripture tells us that God rested and
was refreshed. The root word means to take a long breath. That
is, when the six days' work was done, God looked it all over and
3                               THE SABBATH:

was satisfied, delighted for the sake of man, even as the wise and
loving parent is satisfied at the provision he makes for his children.
  3. God's Works.—The works of the Lord are great, and all who
take pleasure therein appreciate their greatness. His works are
also honorable and glorious. Certainly they should be remem-
bered. To remember that which is great, honorable, and glorious,
ought to be man's greatest pleasure, as it is for his highest good.
God has therefore made His wonderful works to be remembered.
What is a more fitting memorial than that day on which the Crea-
tor ceased His labors and contemplated His work with delight, the
day around which clustered the great facts of a completed creation.

                                    NOTES.
     1. IT may not seem essential to the student to place real study
  on these familiar texts, but it is most important that he should.
  There are two points established by the first division of the lesson,
  which are, by the enemies of God's law, so often disputed. The
  first is that the law which condemns sin and all unrighteousness,
  which is itself perfect righteousness, even God's righteousness, as
  it is God's law, is the law of ten commandments, or the Decalogue.
  These texts clearly prove this. Let the student study the Scrip-
  ture till he knows this truth and can tell it to others. The second
  point is that this law, which is the rule of the judgment, which is
10                          '111E SA13.13A.TH.

the royal law, or law of the great King, is complete in itself,
embraces ourwhole duty, and demands that we love God supremely,
and our neighbor as ourselves.
  2. WE have no account of any other document that God ever
wrote. Moses wrote laws of various kinds in a book. When
Christ was upon earth He wrote men's sins upon the sand. But
the writing of that document which embodied the eternal right-
eousness of God, which embraced in itself all duty, God left not to
man. He engraved it by His own finger on the tables of enduring
rock, showing the permanency of its character.
   3. NOTE, the testimony of the prophet. The people who know
righteousness are the people in whose heart is God's law. His law
is therefore the expression of His righteousness, and this He declares
shall not he abolished. Men may die and earth may perish, but
God's salvation and righteousness are eternal. This scripture
ought to be a comfort to those who love God's law.
   4. "Till All Be Fulfilled." —This certainly included the "proph-
ets." But the prophets predicted things to come which are eter-
nal, as, for instance, the everlasting kingdom of Christ. Dan.
7 : 27. Our Lord therefore would teach us that till eternity would
pass "one jot [yod, the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet]
or one tittle [the little points which distinguish between letters
and so change the sense] shall in nowise pass from the law," till
eternity shall end. The law is as eternal as its Author.
   5. THE position of the fourth commandment in the Decalogue is
worthy of note. If it were placed itt the beginning or end, it
might have been said that it did not belong to the law; but God
pli!ced it in the very center, buttressed behind and before by the
precepts over which man has no question. Thus God made known
that the Sabbath law was of the same eternal nature as all the
other laws with which it is connected.
   6. WHAT is said of the whole law is true of its every part. A
morally perfect law could not be morally imperfect in its parts, for
two or more wrongs can never make a right. When, therefore, it
is said that the law is perfect, good; holy, just, righteous, spiritual,
it declares that every command of that perfect law is of the seine,
character. This, therefore, is true of the Sabbath.'

  SUGGESTIVE QUEST IONS. —In what receptacle were the tables of
the law placed? What was- this ark called, and why? Why is
the law called testimony, and the commandments testimonies?
Why is the law called the fear of the L•wd '? What has reverence
or fear to do with the observance of the law? To what does the
Sabbath commandment bear witness, or testify? What is said
about rewards for kedping the law? How alone can we keep it?

                               NOTES.
   1. THE Sabbath is a memorial not simply of creation, but of
God, the Creator, the only God. " I am God," He tells us, "and
there is none else beside Me." This must be the case; for if God
is Creator, all else are creatures. The Sabbath is a temembrancer
of the great and only God, and the creation is the greatest evi-
dence of His Godhead.
  2, EVERY extraordinary manifestation of God's power to the
world is the showing forth of the same power by which the worlds
were created. -The creation of the heavens and the earth is the
greatest manifestation that earth knows, for nothing would be
                         THE SABBATH.                                       13

greater than calling them out of nothing. The next greatest dis-
play of power was the redemption of His people from the chiefest
of earthly opposing powers, in which the gods of the nations were
proved to be vanity: This redemption frOm Egypt, this making
of Israel a sanctified or separated people, was a display of God's
great power such as had never been seen since the earth was cre-
ated. God did this to show to Israel and the world that He alone
was God, and to spread abroad His name, or character, in the earth.
As the Sabbath was a memorial of God's creative power in the be-
ginning, so it became to Israel not only a memorial of creation,
but a memorial of the same power manifest in redemption and
sanctification; and so it becomes to every child of God.
  3. THE oldest idolatry which history records is sun worship, and
itwas also the most licentious. (See " Lord's Day," part 2, chapter
2.) As Sunday was dedicated to the sun, the times prohibited
by the Lord, the. times observed by Manasseh, must have included
the festival of Sunday, the great rival of the Sabbath of the Lord.

                               NOTES.
    1. THE Sabbath of the Lord, pi:operly kept when the people
 were devoted to God, was now, in their backslidden condition,
 buried under the tradition of the rabbis. Certain knots could
 not be tied or untied; two letters'could not be written so as-to be
•read together and so form a word; no more food than the weight
 of a fig could be carried; fire could neither be kindled nor
 extinguished; an emetic could not be given, nor a broken bone
 set, nor a dislocated joint righted; one kind of sandals might be
 worn, and another kind might not be; one could not lawfully
 carry a loaf, yet two could. Thus were the people burdened
 by many foolish restrictions, while the rabbis .and priests with
 subtle casuistry justified actual breaches in God's law of the Sab-
 bath on their own part.
    2. IN the illustrations used by our Lord, the sheep falling into
 the pit, and the case of David, He did not present them to justify
 Himself. His own deeds justified Him. He said what He did to
 show them by their practice, and by the Scripture, which they pro-
 fessed to believe, that they were inconsistent, and so help them to
 become willing to learn what God had so long before told them, that
 He would have mercy and not sacrifice. Adding to God's com-
 mandments is will worship. He desires that we shall have the
 spirit of the Sabbath as well as its form.
    3. THE Jews had the right day of the Sabbath, but their tradi-
 tions and spirit had made it a burden instead of a blessing. Jesus
 placed it back where God ever designed it should be, a boon of life
 to man. Here came the test,—the Sabbath, a blessing as kept by
 Jesus and enjoined in' the law, or the Sabbath as interpreted by hu-
 man tradition, and enforced by human law upon men's consciences.
 To reject the first was to- reject Christ. To reject the second was to
 suffer persecution (see John 9 : 14, 23, 34), and finally, as in the
 case of Jesus, death (John 5 : 16-1S). In these days the circum-
 stances are the same with one exception,—the sabbaths are different,
  —but it is still tradition against the word of God.

                             NOTES.
  1. THE second chapter of Romans beat's strong testimony to the
worth, obligation, and perpetuity of God's law. The reason why
the Jews knew God's will, and approved the most excellent things,
was because they were instructed by God's law. That they did not
keep the law is true, but that did not affect the law. They-simply
had its form, its outward observance, but this was " the form of
knowledge and of the truth." They observed the seventh day.
That was the truth. What they lacked was the life, which Christ
alone could supply.
  2. THE ten commandments are frequently called God's testi-
monies, because they bear witness against sin and to righteousness
wherever found. For this reason the ark in which they were
placed is called the ark of the testimony or witness. The law'
witnesses that all men are sinners and condemns them. Rom,
 18                         TH E SABBATH.

     : 20, 23. But when Christ place.1 His obedience upon the sinner
  in answer to simple faith, the law of God witnesses that the sinner
  is righteous, because the righteousness of Christ is the righteousness
  of the law.
      3. Goo's law is forever established whether man has faith or
  not. " It is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle
  of the law to fail." Luke 10 : 17. " Forever, 0 Lord, Thy word
  is settled in heaven." Ps. 119 : 89. But in the natural heart of
  man the law is not "established." But faith, genuine faith,
  establishes God's law in the heart. It puts Christ within (Eph.
  3 : 17), and Christ and the law are inseparable (Ps. 40 : 7, 8). See
• Heb. 8 : 8-10.
      4. IN the teachings of Christ the principles of the new covenant
  were laid down ; its ordinances of baptism, humility, and com-
  munion were all given ; the law had been affirmed in both teach-
  ing and example to the time of the cross. The seventh-day Sabbath
  was taught by Christ and kept by Him according to its law till He
  died. Not one word did He speak, not one act did He perform,
  which showed any other day to be holy, nor did He predict holi-
  ness for any offer day in the future. At His death the covenant
  was sealed. His last will and testament was then confirmed.
  Nothing could be taken from it, nothing could be added. The
  new covenant, therefore, confirms the seventh-day Sabbath and no
  other.
      5. THE term " Sabbath " is throughout the New Testament
  fifty-nine times applied to one day of the week alone, namely, the
 day before the first day of the week. It was observed by the Jews;
  it was used as a preaching day by Paul to both Jews and Gentiles
  (Acts 13 : 42, 44); it was Paul's custom to do this (Acts 16 : 13 ;
17 : 3); and while in Athens, a gentile city, he worked at his
  trade with a Jew six days in the week and preached every
 Sabbath for one year and six months (Acts 18 : 1, 4, 11). Every-
  where among the early Christians the seventh day of the week was
  known by no other name.
     6. THE term " first day of the week" occurs only eight times in
  all the New Testament. No other term is applied to that day.
  Six of the texts in the lesson refer to the particular day on which
                            THE SA BBATlI.                             19

Christ rose from the dead; but the disciples did not honor that day,
for they did not believe He had risen. The next mention is found
in the record of Paul's farewell meeting at Troas, where a young
man was raised to life. But that day was used as a day of labor.
The last text simply gives instruction to each one to lay by him-
self on each first day a sum for the poor as God had prospered him,
so that Paul might get it when he came. Paul never taught first-
day observance. See Acts.20 : 20, 27, 32.
  7. THE early Christians of Palestine observed the seventh-day
Sabbath. (See "Lord's Day,'' part 3, chapter 4). The practice of
the apostle Paul we have already learned. There was never a
charge' brought against him tin• transgressing the Sabbath. See
Acts 28: 17, 21. The fact is admitted by authorities generally
that the Christians in. Judea were observers of the seventh-day
Sabbath.

                             NOTES.
      THE Revised Version renders 2 Thess. 2 6, 7 as follows :
"And now ye know that which restraineth, to the end that he
[the' man of sin] may be revealed in his own season. For the
mystery of lawlessness cloth already work ; only there is one that
restraineth now, until he be taken out of the way." "For the
secret of lawlessness is.already working, till only the one restrain-
ing for the present be out of the way." Diaglott. Others are
similar. The old English word "let" means hinder; the Greek
word means withhold, or restrain. Now there is but one power in
the universe that can keep antichrist out of the church, and that
is the power which keeps him out of each individual heart, and
that is Jesus Christ. But Christ will not dwell therein unless we
desire it. If we bid Him go, He will leave, and then we are left to
the working of the mystery of iniquity.
   2. Iw Revelation 17 the apostate church is represented as com-
mitting fornication. She was formerly espoused to Christ. 2 Con
11 : 2. She was bound to Christ by the law of God. To turn
from Him and His law and to turn to others is to commit spiritual
fornication, and become lawless. Paul refers to the same when
he calls that apostasy the man of sin." "Sin is the transgression
of the law " (1 John 3 :4), and the man of sin would be the sinner
above all others. This man of sin is also the mystery of iniquity,
or lawlessness, pointing again to opposition to God's law. Daniel
describes the work of this power more particularly. It would
speak great words against God. It would wear out the saints of
God, and " think to change the times and the law " (Revised
 Version), or, as Wintle and Spurrell render, "the appointed times
and the law," and the saints and the law shall be given into its
 hands for 1,260 years. These specifications the apostasy has ful-
0•)                               E SAIISATH,

filled, It has blasphemed God. It has put to death His saints.
Its spiritual domination lasted 1,260 years, from A. D. 538 to 1798.
It has changed the first appointed time, the beginning of the day,
from sunset, God's time, to midnight, and it has changed the day
of the Sabbath from the seventh to the first day of the week, and
in thus doing has changed God's law. It has changed God's law
in that very part which reveals Him for what He is, the Creator
and Redeemer.
   3. THE ten commandments as given in Roman Catholic cate-
chisms are the same in substance as those given in Ex. 20: 1-17,
with the exception of the Sabbath commandment. The number-
ing is different, but in all other respects nine of them are essen-
tially the same. The catechism calls the first two commandments
one. and divides the tenth to make the full number, thus making
the fourth commandment the third.
   4. THE teaching of the Papacy is as follows:—
   "Question—Say the third commandment.
   "Answer—Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day.
   "Q.—What is commanded by the third commandment?
   "A.—To spend the Sunday in prayer and other religious duties,"
—Butler's Catechism.
   "Q.—How prove you that the church hath power to command
feasts and holy days?
   "A.—By the very act of changing the Sabbath into Sunday,
which Protestants allow of."—Abridgment of Christian Doctrine.

                             NOTES.
  1. A SEAL used in connection with a legal document is a device
by which a document is so stamped as to show it to be authentic
or genuine. By reference to Esther, 8 :8; 1 Kings 21 : 8, it will
be seen that a law must be sealed to be authentic. In the matter
of a law the seal must show the name of the ruler who gave the
law, the position he occupies, the authority he exercises,.the extent
of his dominion—in brief, the name, the authority, the territory.
If any of these are lacking, the law would not be valid or the
document authoritative. The seal of God must be connected with
His law, the only document He ever wrote, and must contain
these three characteristics. When placed upon God's servants, it
is His mark, or seal, stamps them as His, and His alone.
  2. THE work of sealing predicted in Isa. 8 i 16 is a work that
pertains to the Christian dispensation (verse 14), and undoubtedly
refers to Christ. See references from verses 15, 17, 18 to the New
Testament, where this scripture is applied to Christ and His work
and His disciples. Verses 19-22 refer to the last great deception
of Spiritualism and the blackness of darkness which will come
upon the wicked. The plans, schemes, confederacies; and asso-
ciations of man to put off the evil clay, so manifest at the present
lime, are referred to in verses 9-12. The sure refuge is pointed
out in verse 13, the Lord of hosts in the heart. Compare with 1
Peter 3 : 15. And finally verse 17. shows that the sealing work is
carried on when Christ's discip%s are waiting for His coming in
glory. 1 Thess. 1 :10:, Isa. 25 :9. Then those who bear His seal
will say, "Yea, in the,way of Thy judgments, 0 Lord, have we
waited for Thee; to Thy name and to Thy memorial [the Sabbath]
is the desire of our soul." Isa. 26:8, Revised Version. Then •
will the testimony, the witness, the attestation of God's law, be
restored.
                          THE. SABBATH.                           o6'

   3. Tn t: prophecy vi' Iirv. 7 1-4 also refers to the last days. It
is a work which takes place under the sixth seal before God's
judgments are manifest. It comes in between verses 13 and 14 of
 Revelation 6. They are those who- are redeemed- from the .earth
when the Lord comes. Rev. 14 :1-5. They are called Israel in
the primary meaning of the term, those who have prevailing faith
with God. See Gen. 32 : 24-28. All the redeemed host of God
will be called Israel. They will enter the glorious city of the
redeemed through one of its twelve gates, which are named after
one of the twelve tribes. Rev. 21 : 12. They have upon them
the name of Jerusalem, their mother. Rev. 3:12. This com-
pany, the redeemed as a whole, are not among the numbered
tribes of earth, but all are numbered in the records on high, chil-
dren of God. They are those who have had sincere repentance,
and who, weep over sin (Eze. 9 : 4), who are Christ's disciples
indeed (Isa. 8: 16; ,John 8 :81, 32). They are the true Israel of
God by faith. Rom. 2 : 28, 29; Eph. 2 : 12, 13, 19, 20.
       IT is the meek and humble that God will teach and guide;
it is the submissive He will mould and purify and refine through
trial by His word. The dross will be burned away till the pure
metal reflects His image. The stubborn clay will be beaten and
moulded and softened, if possible, till God can stamp it with his
own seal. The stamping, the sealing, is the finishing part of the
 work. The soul is tried, and is not found wanting. The law is
written in the heart, and the seal of that law, the fourth com-
mandment, which reveals to us the fullness of Christ's power and
character a's the only living and true God, which reveals to us in
that character that "name above every name," is the last work of
the Spirit of God prior to the coming of Christ. That seal will be
placed upon no one who loves sin. It will be impressed upon
everyone who hates sin and loves Christ, or chooses Christ above
all things else.
  SuooEsTrvx QUESTIONS.—The Spirit of God—what is its work
in the heart of the believer? What is its attitude toward God's
law? Does the Spirit lead us contrary to the law? What is
that spirit which would lead us contrary to God's law? Is Rev.
7: 1-3 now being fulfilled? What is the character of those sealed?
Rev. 14: 1-5. Over whom do they obtain victory, and through
whom? Rev.       :

 Heb. 4 : 9, margin; Isa. 66 : 22, 23.


                             NOTES.
  1. THAT the message of the angel of Rev. 14 : 6, 7 (symbolizing
God's messengers) is applicable to the last days alone is evident,
(1) from the message given, "The hour of God's judgment is
come." Paul preached the gospel in view of a judgment to come.
Acts 17:31: 24 : 25. But in this text it declares that it is come.
The investigative judgment, beginning in 1844, had then begun.
(2) The second and third messages follow or go with the first, and
the coming of the Lord immediately follows. The message there-
28                         THE SABBATH,

fore pertains to the last days. It is a part of the great Threefold
message by which God would save the last generation.
   2. FEAR, or reverence, of God is exercised only by a meek and
humble heart, which realizes its own nothingness and God'S com-
pleteness. Such a heart will count God's wisdom greatest and His
ways the best. It will therefore render to Him the glory due, or,
what is the same thing, submit willingly to keep His command-
ments. God will do the rest.
   3. THE scripture referred to in Jeremiah 6 doubtless has refer-
ence to Israel then, and because of that it was spoken to them; but
it also has reference to the times in which we live, and therefore it
is written for these days. We have at the present time the peace
and safety cry " of verses 14, 15 (see 1 Thess. 5 : 1-3); we have
the message of the Lord calling His people back to the old ways
and His watchmen to listen to the sound of the trumpet of coming
danger ("lee Joel 2: 1; Rev. 14 : 6, 7); we have the refusals to
walk in His way or to listen to the sound of the trumpet; we have
the gathering out of the remnant church (Jer. 6 :.9), which will
keep the law of God (Rev. 12 : 17); and finally God's judgments
upon the people because they have rejected His law (Rev. 14: 9-11).
   4, CHRts•r'S salvation which is near to come, and His righteous-
ness which is to be revealed, cannot relate to the salvation which
He hiss ever been constantly bestowing upon believing sinners. It
is to His everlasting salvation (Isa. 45 : 17), with which He will
save His people at His coming, for which the earth is now groaning;
and which will be given at the second coining of Christ. See Isa.
25: 9; Luke 21 : 28; Rom. 8 : 23; Heb. 9 : 28. That'righteousness
will also be revealed in its fullness when Christ comes. Ps. 50: 3-6.
At the time predicted in the prophecy, which is this time, the Sab-
bath of the Lord will he a matter of agitation, of testing', of bless-
ing.
   5. IsALA.0 58 and 59 are both parts of one prophecy; there should
be no chapter heading between them. They are both a part of the
same message, the first part containing reproof, instruction, and
warning; the second part, denunciation upon the wicked, and
promises for those who heed the message. The time to•which it
applies is just before the Lord comes with vengeance to recompense
                                  E                                          ')9

ills enemies and to save His people. See Isa. 59 : 17-20. Out of His
people to whom this message is sent will come those who will build
up the " waste places '' of God's downtrodden law, " raise up "
the highway of God's holiness, repair " the breach " made by the
man of sin, etc. To do this they' will turn away their feet from
the Sabbath. This wort: is now being carried forward. The
standard of God's truth is erected against the enemy. Rev.
12 : 17; Isa. 50 : 19; Rev. 14 :

                             NOTES.
  1. GOD requires of us to be holy, righteous, perfect, keepers of
His holy, righteous, perfect law, While we cannot of ourselves
meet His requirements, there is that power in the very require-
ments themselves which will enable us to become and do all that
God commands if we will but yield to do it. The Revised Version
of 1 Peter 1 : 16 reads, "Ye shall be holy; for I am holy." God is
able to make us all that He requires us to be. This He does by
putting into us His own presence. 1 Cor. 1 : 17-19 ; Rom. 8 : 9.
  2. GOD made the Sabbath holy in the beginning in the same
way He makes us holy, in the same way He made Mount Sinai
holy, by putting His own presence within the clay in a special
sense.
                          THE SABBA.TH,                          31

    3. THE Lord does not lay down hard and fast rules in His word
 concerning all the details of life. He lays down clear and positive
 commands concerning our duty. He lays down broad and far-
 reaching principles, and oftentimes specific examples to illustrate
 the principle. He has done this as regards Sabbath observance.
 It was made for man, not to be a day of absolute physical rest, not
 to be a burden, but a day of spiritual delight, of communion with
 God, of labor for Him. Preparation for our needs the day before
 will give us the sacred hotirs for spiritual growth and meditation
 upon God and His works. It is as important now as it was in the
days of ancient Israel that we should bake and seethe (boil) for the
Sabbath on the day previous. This is illustrative of other duties.
This does not mean, however, that cooking is not sometimes justi-
fied. God will have mercy and not sacrifice. The feeble often
need warm food. The sick sometimes demand special food and
care. The little ones need milk. Let the .controlling question of
each one be as regards himself, not his neighbor, "What will
glorify God?"
    4. By " thy pleasure " is meant the pleasure of the worldly
minded. Such are to take their feet from the Sabbath,—turn from
dishonoring it. The Christian, however, delights in it, as he
delights in all God's law. Ps. 1 :2 ; 119 :47. He has found
delight in an indwelling Saviour, and the regenerated heart finds
added delight in the Sabbath, in which that same Saviour dwells.
   5. IN the example of our Lord we find a true interpretation, an
object lesson of the law of the Sabbath. He did not seek His own
pleasure or his own profit, but that of others. He attended the
public assemblies and listened to or read the word of God. He
sought God for the strength He needed. He justified His disciples
whom the Jews condemned for supplying their needs by rubbing
out the wheat in their hands. He ministered to the sick and
afflicted ; He spoke words of comfort and instruction to the long-
ing soul. Such should be our mission.
   6. As we do not know how the Sabbath should be observed as
we ought to know, how important it is that we seek Him in whom
are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, that He may
make us wise to know! And when should we do this? All
32                       •rmiE

through the week we should remember the Sabbath, in order that
we may keep it holy when it comes, and plan our work, our busi-
ness, our associations, accordingly. We should seek Him espe-
cially at the beginning of the Sabbath. If we are alone in honoring
God's day, let to draw apart with the Master for a season. If we
have companions, associates, seek God with them. If our family
is all united, let us gather around the family altar and repeat some
passage from the word of life, or read from its sacred page, repeat-
ing the fourth commandment in unison, and then seek God for
His Sabbath blessing. Give the children a part. Let the irritated
feelings, worn nerves, be soothed by the Spirit of the Master, and
let each minister blessings to the others. In thus seeking God wc
will know how to put a difference between the clean and unclean,
between the holy and profane. Ere. 22 : 2(.
   7. THE Sabbath day should bring us double blessing. The
priests, who represented the whole people, ate the bread of God's
presence on the Sabbath day. They therefore partook more largely
of His presence. They received a portion which they did not upon
other days. This is what the Sabbath should be to us. We should
have the blessing of God's presence in the heart on all clays; we
should have the added blessing of the Sabbath on that day. Thus
would we be lifted to a higher spiritual plane each week ; amid as
God never bestows one spiritual grace that He does not wish us to
retain, and which He will enable us to keep, so the next Sabbath
would lift us to a still higher plane of spiritual life. Thus would
every Sabbath be fi stepping-stone to lift us nearer God.

                               NOTES.
   1. WE are the Lord's by creation, for He gave us existence. He
 created us, Gen. 1 :26, 27; 2: 7. Having forfeited our lives by
 sin, Christ dies for us to redeem us from death. 1 Cor. 15:22.
 Therefore, we are the Lord's both by creation and redemption.
   2. Six days of the week are to be used as days of ordinary labor,
 in the calling or employment to which God's providence has called
 us. By faithfulness in the duties of life, and doing all things
 heartily as unto the Lord and not unto men, we serve the Lord
 Christ. Col. 3: 23, 24.. Having permission to use the six days
for secular labor, we call it secular or common time. The seventh
day having been set apart as a holy day, we are commanded to
keep it holy.
   3. To use the Sabbath for ourselves, and not devote it to the
Lord as holy time, is robbing Him. It belongs to the Lord, for
He claims it as His. He calls it " My holy day." Isa. 58 : 13.
Therefore, when we disregard God's claim, and disobey His com-
mand concerning the seventh day, we rob Him of holy time.
   4. THE tithing system is based on the same principle as the Sab-
bath, viz., the right of property. The Sabbath and the tithe both
belong to the Lord. He claims them as His. This claim dates
back to the patriarchal age, and was recognized by Abraham and
Jacob. The Lord has never relinquished His claim upon either;
therefore they are both obligatory in all dispensations, from the
flat° the restoration. The difference between the two obligations
is this,—the Sabbath was instituted as a memorial adapted to the
race both before and after the fall, while the tithing system- has
grown out of man's sinful condition, and the need of a systematic
                           TITHING.                          3,5

plan Co provide means for carrying on the work of the gospel in
saving men from sin. The tithing system is therefore coeval with
the preaching of the gospel.




   LESSON X11.-September 21, 1895.

                    TITHING-Continued.

    1. To whom (lid Abraham pay tithes? Gen. 14 : 18-20; Heb
7 :1, 2.
    2. Who was Melchizedek? Arts.-" Priest of the Most High
God." Verses 1, 2.
    3. What is said of his genealogy? Verse 3. (See note 1.)
    4. What is said of his greatness? Verse 4.
    5. Of whom did the Levites receive tithes? Verse 5.
    6. Who received tithes of Abraham? Verse 6. 44'
    7. By whom was Abraham blessed? Verses 1, 6.
    8. Who, then, was the greater, Melchizedek or Abraham?
Verses 4, 6, 7.
    9. Whom did Melchizedek represent? Verse 3.
  10. After what order was Christ a priest? Heb. 5: 6; 6 : 20;
7 ; 17, 21.
  11. Then does Christ receive tithes? Heb. 7 : 8.
  12. What did the Saviour teach concerning tithing'? Matt.
23:23. (See note 2.)
  13. Then, as followers of the teachings of Christ, what ought
we to do? Arts.-Pay tithes. (S6e note 3.) •
  14. How were the Levites supported in their work? 1 Cor.
9; 13. (See note 4.)
  15. What has the Lord likewise ordained concerning the support
of those who preach the gospel? Verse 14. (See note 5.)
  16. Who commissions and sends out those who preach the- gos-
pel? Matt. 28:18-20; John 20 : 21.
  17. Then whose servants are they? who employs them?
36                            TITHING.

  18. And in accordance with what has been shown in the above,-
what provision has the Lord made for the support of His laborers?
(See note 6.)


                             NOTES.
   1. THAT is, there is no record of his genealogy. He had no suc-
cessor or predecessor in the priesthood; and Christ is a priest after
the order of Melchizedek, because He did not belong to a priestly
line, with a predeCessor and successor in the same line.
   2. THE force of this scripture will be seen and realized more fully
when we remember that Christ's teaching during His public minis.
try was designed especially for what is generally called the Christian
dispensation. This is concluSively shown by the language used in
the great commission. Christ gives explicit instruction to the apos-
tles to teach " all things whatsoever I have commanded you." Seo
Matt. 28: 19,20.
  3. Ought.—''Was or were under obligations to pay; owed. To
be bound in duty or moral obligations."— Webster. While it is
proper to instruct the people from the word of God in the duty
of paying tithes, each individual should be left free to decide
for himself how much he will pay. No one should try to be
conscience for another in the matter.
   4. To live on the things of the temple was to live on the things
brought into the Lord's storehouse. This consisted principally of
the tithe. See Mal. 3 : 10; Num. 18 : 20-24; 2 Chron. 31 : 4-12.
  5. " EVEN so " means in like manner. As the priests and
Levites were supported by the tithes brought into the storehouse
by those who recognized and responded to God's claim upon them.
" even so " God's ministers now are supported by the tithes brought
into the Lord's treasury by- those who believe and obey the gospel.
  6. THE Lord has made ample provision for the support of those
who labor in His vineyard. He has reserved the tithe for this pur-
poe; it is the Lord's. He uses His own means to recompense Hi;
     laborers.

       LESSON XI11.-September 28, 1895.
                    TITHING-Concluded.

    1. To whom do the Sabbath and the tithe belong? Er,
20 : 8-10; Isa. 58: 13; Lev. 27 : 30.
    2. Has He a just claim? If so, what is it? (See note 1.)
    3. If they rightfully belong to the Lord, what course should
we pursue in relation to them?
    4. What has He commanded in regard to the Sabbath? Ex.
20 : 8-11; Isa. 58 : 13,
    5. Then how 'should we regard the Sabbath? Ex. 20 : 8-10:
Isa. 58 : 13.
    6. What has He commanded in regard to the tithe? Lev.
27 : 30-33; Num. 18 :20, 21, 25-27; 2 Chron. 31 :2-10; Mal. 3 :10.
     7. What should we do with the Lord's tithe? Mal. 3: 10.
    8. If we do not do this, of what sin are we guilty? Mal.
3 : 8. (See note 2.)
    9. To what dispensation does the prophecy of Malachi 3 per-
tain? Mal. 3:1-5, 16-18. (See note 8.)
   10. In what time does it especially apply? Mal. 3:2, 8, :i.
(See note 3.)
   11. What complaint does the Lord make against His people?
Verse 7, first clause.
   12. Relate the conversation between the Lord and His people
recorded in verses 7, 8.
   13. Why are God's people cursed.? Verse 9; Hag. 1.: 5-11.
(See note 4.)
   14. What does He ask us to do? Mal. 3:10.
   15. What precious promiseldoes this imply? (See note '5.)
   16. What promise does the Lord give us? Verses 11, 12. See
;ilso 2 Chron. 31 : 5-10; Prov. 3 :9, 10; Acts 20 :35.


                            NOTES.
  1. As the Lord created us, and has given us life and breath and
all things (Acts 17 : 24-28) , we belong to Him, and all we have
38                           TITHING,


belongs to Him. The One who freely gives us everything certainly
has a right to reserve to Himself a portion of our time and a por-
tion of our means as a test of our love and worship, Such a claim
is manifestly just.
   2. As the tithe is the Lord's, and rightfully belongs to Him, we
have no right to use it for ourselves, or appropriate it in any way;
if we do, we are guilty of robbing God. Our duty is simply to
place it in the treasury of the Lord, that it may be used to pay His
servants.
   3. MALACHI 3 so clearly applies to the Christian dispensation
that no argument is necessary to prove it. A careful reading of
the chapter, in connection with chapter 4, is sufficient to convince
the candid seeker after truth that it belongs to the present dispen-
sation, and especially to the last days.
   4. WHEN we seek our own ease and comfort, and do not respond
to God's claims upon us, and yet know what they are, God's curse
will surely fall upon us,
   5. THIS language necessarily implies the precious promise that if .
we bring all the tithes into the storehouse,' and thus prove Him, as
He asks us to do, He will pour us out a blessing that there will not
be room enough to receive it. Those who prove or test the Lord
always find him true to His promise. We are not to conclude,
however, that the Lord will necessarily shower temporal blessings
upon us because we are faithful in paying tithes. He will give us
just such blessings as He sees will be for our best good and for His
glory.
