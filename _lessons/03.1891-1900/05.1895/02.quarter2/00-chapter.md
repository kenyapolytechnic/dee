 THE BOOK OF DANIEL
               For Senior( Classes.

                     eS TO JUNE 29, 11395.


                  INTRODUCTORY NOTE.
  THE lessons that have been prepared for this quarter do not pur-
port to include the entire book of Daniel, but only such portions
of it as are thought to be most profitable for study in our Sabbath
schools, and which can be covered by one quarter's lessons; hence
we use the title, " Lessons from the Book of Daniel."
  The portions of the book which have been examined contain the
great lines of prophecy and prophetic periods with which all our
people ought to be familiar. Some of the lessons will review-a
few points in the lessons of the previous quarter. This will be a
decided advantage in fixing in the mind some of the great funda-
mental truths which make us a peculiar people:
   The great importance of the careful study of these lessons, and
all our Sabbath school lessons which discuss the reasons of oui•
faith, is very forcibly set forth in Testimony No. 33, p. 236.
We quote the language, and trust that it will be carefully read
and faithfully heeded:—

   " Many who profess to have a knowledge of the present truth
know not what they believe. They do not understand the evi-
dences of their faith. They have no appreciation of the work for
the present time. When the time of trial shall come, there are
men now preaching to others who will find, upon examining the
positions they hold, that there are many things for which they
can give no satisfactory reason. Until thus tested, they knew not
their great ignorance. And there are many in the church mho
take it for granted that they understand what they believe, but,
until controversy arises, they do not know their own weakness.
When separated from those of like faith, and compelled to stand
singly and alone to explain their belief, they will be surprised to
see how confused their ideas are of what they had accepted as truth.
  " God will arouse His people. If other means fail, heresies will
come in among them, which will sift them, separating the chaff
from the wheat. The Lord calls upon all who believc in His
word to awake out of sleep. Precious light has come, appropriate
for this time. It is Bible truth, showing the perils that are right
upon us. This light should lead us to a diligent study of the
Scriptures, and a most critical examination of the positions which
we hold. God would have all the bearings and positions of truth
thoroughly and perseveringly searched, with prayer and fasting.
Believers are not to rest in suppositions and ill-defined ideas of
what constitutes truth. Their faith must be firmly founded upon
the word of God, so that when the testing time shall come, and
they are brought before councils to answer for their faith, they
may be able to give a reason for the hope that is in them, with
meekness and fear,"

                             NOTES.
  1. NEBUCHADNEZZAR, king of Babylon, besieged Jerusalem
    e. 607, and captured it B. C. 606. In. B. C. 583 he took it
again and destroyed the temple, and laid the city waste.
  2. DANIEL'S purpose to not defile himself with the king's meat
(food) and the wine which he drank presents a very worthy exam-
ple of temperance and self-control. How many of God's professed
people will partake of unhealthful foods and drinks to please their
friends, or gratify their own tastes, instead of having a fixed pur-
pose, as did Daniel, to glorify God! Daniel would please God by
not defiling himself, even though he displeased the king and lost
his life. He preferred to honor the God of heaven, though he
disobeyed the mightiest monarch on earth. This is loyalty to
God.
   3. TIIOSE who are loyal to God and faithful in their work, and
consistent in their course toward others, will find friends even in
kings' courts, or wherever God's providence places them.
   4. " KING'S MEAT " (PuL5E).—The ''king's meat,'' or food,
would no doubt include many unhealthful articles and,. unclean
flesh meats, and very likely some things that were offered to idols;
hence loyalty to God would lead Daniel to refuse such food, and
choose simply "pulse to eat and water to drink." The literal
meaning of the words here translated " pulse," according to
" Smith's Bible Dictionary," is seeds of any kind. It further
says: " Probably the term denotes uncooked grain of any•kind,
whether barley, wheat, millet, vetches," etc.
   5. THE better appearance of Daniel and his companions was
probably not wholly due to the better food which they ate. It is
evident that God's special blessing was given them because of their
devotion and loyalty to God,
   6. To stand before the king was to occupy a position of honor
and authority in the king's court.
   7. WE are not to infer by the expression in verse 21 that Daniel
died in the first year of King Cyrus, but he continued in the king's
court as long as the Babylonian Kingdom ruled, even until it was
overthrown by the Medes and Persians. See chapter 5.

         LESSON 11.-April 13, 1895.
      THE SOURCE OF WISDOM. Daniel 2: 1-30.

    1. WHEN and by what was Nebuchadnezzar troubled? Verse 1.
    2. What did the king command? Verse 2.

  15. With what words did he praise the Lord for His mercy?

  1.6. When Daniel was brought before the king, what did he say
of the wise men and astrologers? Verse 27.
  17. Who did he say could reveal the secret? Verse 28.
  18. What did the Lord make known to Nebuchadnezzar by his
dream? Verse 29.
  19. Why was the dream revealed to Daniel? Verse 30. (See
note 4.)
                            NOTES.
  1. THE Chaldeans tried to make it appear that the king's request
was not reasonable; but, as they pretended to communicate with
the "gods whose dwellin is not with flesh," the king's request
was very proper.
8             LESSONS FROM THE BOOK OF DANIEL.

  2. THE king did not suspect Daniel of trying "to gain the
time," as he suspected the wise men, for Daniel promised to show
the king the interpretation of his dream; he only wanted time to
seek his God for a knowledge of the secret, while they confessed
that they could not interpret the dream unless the king would first
tell them what it was.
  3. DANIEL called the brethren together to seek Him who is the
Source of all wisdom, believing that the Lord would reveal the
matter to him. His faith was so strong that he promised to show
the king the interpretation of his dream. If all would seek the
wisdom which is from above as did Daniel, they would have the
knowledge of God. James 1 : 5.
  4. IN making known to Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the
latter days, or hereafter, as it is expressed in verse 45, he gave
     a brief but comprehensive history of the world from his own
the, till the kingdoms of this world would be overthrown by the
kingdom of God. There are two important lessons that we may
learn from this scripture. One is that the Lord sometimes reveals
His truth to those not directly connected with His people and
work, and the other is that He delights to honor His faithful serv-
ants before the great men of earth, and also deliver them from
danger and death if His name can be honored thereby.

 Verse 49.

                            NOTES.
  1. FROM  gold to iron and clay shows a great deterioration in
value and quality. This clearly proves decline and degeneracy of
nations and the race, instead of improvement and growth to a
golden age of peace and righteousness, which many so fondly
cherish.
  2. THE stone, which represents the kingdom of God, destroys all
earthly governments. It does not convert and absorb themi it
10            LESSONS FROM THE BOOK OF DANIEL,

smites them, and they are broken in pieces. See also Ps. 2: 8, 9.
Then the stone occupies all the territory, and "fills the whole
earth." "All things that' offend, and them which do iniquity"
having been gathered out of the kingdom (referring to the terri-
tory, see Matt. 13 : 41), it, the territory of these earthly kingdoms,
not the people, becomes the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ
(Rev. 11 : 15). It should be noticed that the stone smites the image
on the feet, which were not developed till over 300 years after
Christ came; hence the kingdom of God was not set up at His first
advent.
  3. "Tseou art this head of gold." That is, Babylon, the king-
dom of which he stood at the head and representative, was the
head of gold. The different divisions of the image represent the
kingdoms which were to follow each other in the supremacy of the
world. This is clearly shown by verses 39 and 40, and all students
of history know that from Daniel's time these kingdoms were
Babylon, Medo-Persia, Grecia, and Rome; hence these kingdoms
were symbolized by the gold, the silver, the brass, and the iron of
the great metallic image.
  4. IT should be noted here that the division of the fourth king-
dom (Rome) is not based on the fact that there are feet and toes
(and naturally ten toes, which might indicate ten divisions of the
kingdom), but that the feet and toes are part of potter's clay and
part of iron. The scripture says, "Whereas thou sawest the feet
and toes, part of potter's clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall
be divided." The division is indicated by the iron and clay and
not by the toes. Hence in this scripture the division of the Roman
Kingdom is symbolized, but not the number of the divisions. The
division of Rome into ten parts is clearly shown in Danie1.7 and
in the Revelation by the ten horns of the beasts, which symbolize
Rome. Revelation 13 and 17.
   5. BY intermarriage among the royal families some of the kings
sought to unite interests and make combinations that would give
them power and universal supremacy, but they failed, for the Lord
had said that "they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron
is not mixed with clay.''
              ttssoss FROrd THE: BOOK OF DANIEL.                  11.

  6. THE, kingdom of God must exist with power to overthrow all
earthly governments before it smites them and breaks them in
pieces, as taught in the prophecy. Christ is crowned King and
receives His kingdom before He comes again to the earth. Luke
19 : 12-15. When He comes He will wear a golden crown (Rev.
14 : 14), and on His vesture a name is written, "KING OF KINGS,
AND LORD OF LORDS" (Rev. 19:16). He will then gather the
subjects of His kingdom (Matt. 24 : 30,31), and when the territory is
cleared (Matt. 18 : 41; Dan. 2: 34, 35), then the stone, or kingdom
of God, will become a great mountain and fill the whole earth.
Thus the kingdom is set up and fully established by a succession
of events. The king, capital, subjects, and territory will be
brought into harmonious relations.

   17. What did the king then say? Verse 28.
   18. What decree did he issue? Verse 29.
   19. What did he do for the men who proved loyal to God?
 Verse 30.

                                NOTES.
      1. IT will be remembered that the great image of Daniel 2 was
 composed of various metals, of which only the head was gold. It
  was, no doubt, pleasing to Nebuchadnezzar to be told that his
  kingdom was represented by the head of gold. But to be told that
 other kingdoms would follow his would not be so pleasing, for his
 ambition would lead him to desire that his kingdom might con-
  tinue till the close of human history, and so he made a great image,
 composed wholly of gold, expressive of this desire.
     2. IF these Hebrew children had reasoned as many have rea-
 soned, and as many do still, they could have bowed down to the
 golden image at the king's command, and plead in justification that
  they did not worship the image, and hence did not break the
 second commandment, because simply bowing down before a thing
  is not sin, unless we render worship or homage to it. To have
  done this, however, they would feign, or.try to make others believe,
  that they were loyal to the king and worshiped his image. In other
  words, they would have practiced deception, failed to witness for
 the truth, and dishonored God, just for selfish advantage. So,
  now, many will receive the mark of the beast by refraining
  from Sunday labor in obedience to the law of the land, under the
  plea that they can do this and still obey God in the observance of
  the Sabbath. But this is false and fallacious. The weekly Sab-
  bath is a divine institution, and abstinence from secular labor is
. the only outward evidence of its observance. When the State
              LESSONS FROM THE BOOK OF DANIEL.                    13

commands abstinence from secular labor on some other day of tne
week, it sets up a rival Sabbath. Hence, when we obey the State
by abstaining from labor on the clay it sets apart for rest, we
observe that rival Sabbath, and worship the power which makes
and enforces it ; and thus we prove disloyal to God, and it would
all be done for selfish interests.
  3. THE common- version of the Bible quotes Nebuchadnezzar as
saying that " the form of the fourth is like the Son of God." This
would lead to the idea that he thought that this personage was
Christ. While we have no doubt that He was Christ, we have no
evidence that Nebuchadnezzar knew of any such being. The new
version renders this expression, " the aspect of the fourth is like a
son of the gods." This evidently givos the true meaning of the
original, as Nebuchadnezzar was at that time a heathen king, who,
no doubt, had many idol gods.



            LESSON V.--Ilay 4, 1895.

note 1.)
  16. What occurred at the end of twelve months? Verses 28, 29.
  17. What wards of pride did he utter? Verse 30.
  18. What did a voice from heaven declare? Verse 31.
  19. What lesson did the Lord wish to teach this proud king?
Verse 32.
  20. How long was it before the sentence was executed? Verse 33.
  21. What was the king's experience? Verse 33.
  22. How long before his reason returned? Verse 34. (See note 2.)
  23. What did he then do? Verse 34.
  24. What lesson had he learned? Verse 35.
  25. What was his experience after his reason returned? Verse 36.
  26. How did he regard the God of heaven? Verse 37. (See
note 3.)

                             NOTES.
  1. THE counsel given the king by Daniel was clearly the counsel
of God, for in another scripture the Lord gives the same counsel
when He says, " Cease to do evil; learn to do well; seek judgment,
relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.
Isa. 1: 16, 17. The same thought is also expressed in James 1 : 27.
We are enabled to break off our sins by securing the righteousness
of God by faith. Rom. 3 : 21, 22, 25.
  2. IT is generally agreed among Bible scholars that a " time " in
the book of Daniel and in the Revelation means a year. Josephus
says that the seven " times " were seven years, and it will be
             tBSSONS FROM THE BOOK OF DANIEL.                  15

noticed that the same expression, "seven times," is used by the
Lord when He tells Nebuchadnezzar plainly and in literal terms
what his experience will be. (See verses 29-33.)
   3. THE chastening of the Lord in Nebuchadnezzar's case proved
of great value to him. So far as the Scripture record is concerned
it indicates that he proved loyal to God ever after. This case is
certainly a very instructive one.

                               NOTES.
  1. THE Lord's prophets'and His true servants have never feared
to administer reproof even to kings. • The cases of Nathan, Jere-
miah, John the Baptist, and many others, might be cited. They
will always be very careful, however, to speak the word of the
Lord, and that only, lest they do more harm than good. Those
who love to give reproof are almost sure to do it in their own spirit,
and not in the spirit of Christ. Those who are kind and merciful
in spirit do not enjoy giving reproof. It pains them to do such
work. They will be sure to seek the Lord that they may reprove
wisely and in the spirit of the Master.
  2. THESE words were from the Hebrew language, which was
not understood in the king's court. The words and their defini-
tions are as follows: Mene, numbered; tekel, weight; pens,
divided (peres is singular, and upharsin is the plural). It will be
seen that it was not sufficient to simply know the meaning of .these
words. It needed the wisdom of GO to know to what He would
have them applied, and Daniel, the prophet of God, had wisdom
imparted to him so he could apply them correctly, as the 'sequel
clearly proved.

  1, IT is the privilege of the children of God to have the same
character that Daniel had, so that their enemies can find no accu-
sation against them, except concerning the law of their God, or,
in other words, in regard to their religious faith, Our course
should be faultless before the world, then our influence will tell
most powerfully in favor of the religion which we profess. If we
18           LESSONS FROM THE BOOK OF DANIEL.

do unto others as we would that others should do unto us, this will
be the case. We will be kind, generous, forgiving, gentle, honest,
and truthful.
   2. DANIEL was not ashamed of his religion, neither was he
afraid to have it known that he prayed to God, even when he
risked his life by continuing his devotions, as was his custom.
Daniel was not defiant in his attitude toward the king. He only
prayed as aforetime. If he had begun this manner of praying
after the decree was issued, he would have shown a defiant spirit,
which is never proper for the Christian to manifest. The people
of God should be loyal to Him, whether human laws are liberal
or oppressive, whether they are framed in the interests of liberty
and equality, or of a religious despotism. And, however unjust
and oppressive, human laws should be obeyed by the Christian
unless they conflict with the law of God or our duty to Him. To
this rule there is no exception.

  19. What kingdom is to follow these earthly kingdoms? Verses

   20. Who will then possess the kingdom? Verses 18, 27. (See
note 10.)

                             NOTES.
  1. "WINDS" in prophecy are used to symbolize war, strife, and
commotion. See Jer. 25: 31-33, where, as the result of a great
whirlwind, the slain covered the earth. In Rev. 7: 1-3 the angels
are commanded to hold the " winds," prevent war and strife, that
God's work may not be hindered. " Sea," or waters, is used to
symbolize nations and peoples. (See Rev. 17: 15; Isa. 8: 7.) This
exposition exactly harmonizes with the result described in Dan.
7: 3,—four great beasts came up from the sea; that is, four king-
doms arose as a result of war and strife among the nations.
  2. DANIEL had a desire to know what these things meant; so he
inquired of one who stood by and asked him the truth of all this,
that is, what he was to learn from the vision. The one who stood
by was no doubt the angel Gabriel, whom the Lord had sent to give
him. the vision and explain it, as he did the visions of the eighth
and ninth chapters. (See Dan. 8 : 15-19; 9:21-23.) The Lord
gives to all the precious promise, ''Ask, and it shall be given you;
seek, and ye shall find." Luke 11:9.
20             LESSONS FROM THE BOOK OF DANIEL.

   3. ALL students of history agree that Babylon, Medo-Persia,
Grecia, and Rome ruled the world in the order named, beginning
in the time of Daniel. And nearly all Bible expositors agree that
the four beasts of Daniel 7 symbolize those four universal empires
that successively bore sway over all the earth. Verse 17 says that
"these great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise;"
that is, four kingdoms, "kings" standing for "kingdoms." That
these beasts represented kingdoms and not kings merely is clearly
proved by verse 23, which says that " the fourth beast shall be the
fourth kingdom upon earth."
  4. THE lion and eagle's wings would fitly represent a nation both
great in power and rapid in movement. This was true of Babylon
in the days of Nebuchadnezzar. (See Jer. 4:13; Hab. 1 :6-8.)
The change described in Dan. 7: 4 evidently represented the change
which took place in Babylon after Nebuchadnezzar passed away
and the kingdom became weak and degenerate under the rule of
Nabonadius and Belshazzar.
   5. THE bear raising itself up on one side no doubt symbolizes the
greater power and influence of Persia in its relation to Media, with
which it was united. One side, Persia, was raised up higher than
the other, Media, in the Medo-Persian Kingdom. The three ribs
in the mouth of the bear are generally supposed to represent the
three countries, Babylon, Lydia, and Egypt, which were con-
quered by Medo-Persia, the conquering of which further incited it
to cruelty and conquest.
   6. THE leopard is a fleet-footed beast, hence, with four wings
added, it would represent a nation of more rapid movement than one
symbolized by a lion with only two wings. Grecia, under the lead-
ership of Alexander, made more rapid conquests, ,and marched her
armies with a celerity never equaled in ancient times. The four
heads represented the four parts into which Grecia was divided
after the death of Alexander. (See lesson 10, notes 4 and 5.)
   7. THE fourth beast represents the fourth kingdom upon earth,
and this was Rome. It was diverse from all other kingdoms in
two important particulars : (1) As a kingdom it changed its reli-
             LESSONS FRONI THE BOOK OF DANIEL.                    21

gion from paganism to so-called Christianity. (2) It reversed the
policy of all pagan nations in regard to the relation of the church
to the State. In the.pagam nations the State dominated the church.
This is the pagan principle of government. After Rome changed
its religion from paganism to papacy, and the papal supremacy was
established, the church dominated the State. This is the papal
principle of government.
   8. THE angel said that ''the ten horns out of this kingdom
[Rome] are ten kings [or kingdoms] that shall arise." ThiS has
proved exactly true of Rome, and has never been true of any other
kingdom. Rome was divided into ten kingdoms between the
years 351 and 476 A. D. They have been known in history as the
ten kingdoms of Western Europe.
   9. THE rest of the beasts, Babykin, Medo-Persia, Grecia, had
their dominion or supremacy taken away, but they still continued
to exist as nations, that is, their lives were prolonged for a season
and a time,—an indefinite period.
   10. How encouraging is such a promise as this to God's faithful
people, who, as pilgrims and strangers in this dark world of sin, are
oppressed and ruled over by earthly kingdoms! Soon deliverance
will come to God's people, and they " will take the kingdom, and
possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever."

  16. How did these solemn scenes affect Daniel? Verse 28.
  17. What did he do? Verse 28.

                              NOTES.
  1. THE little horn of this chapter symbolizes the Papacy. It
came up among ten kingdoms, and plucked up, or destroyed, three
of the ten to secure its position of supremacy. The ten kingdoms
of the Roman Empire arose between the years 351-476 A. D. The
three kingdoms which were destroyed to make way for the Papacy
were as follows: The Heruli, in A. D. 493; the Vandals, in A. D. 533;
and the Ostrogoths, in A. D. 538. Justinian, the Roman emperor,
in A. D. 533, made the bishop of Rome the head over all the
churches, and the corrector of heretics. The Ostrogoths opposed
the claims of the bishops of Rome, hence the will of the emperor
could not be carried into effect till the Ostrogoths were subjugated.
  2. THE cunning, shrewdness, and the sharp policy of the
Papacy is represented by the little horn having eyes like the eyes
             LESSONS FROM THE BOOK OF DANIEL.                    23


of man; and as this power was to be a blasphemous, persecuting,
law-changing power (see verse 23), Paul calls it the "man of sin,"
who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that
is worshiped. 2 Thess. 2 : 1-4.
  3. THESE verses clearly show that the Papacy will exist as a
persecuting power when Christ comes the second time. The beast
goes alive into the lake of fire. It will be a living, persecuting
power at that time as much as the two-horned beast or false
prophet. (See Dan. 7 : 11; Rev. 19 : 19, 20.) One of the heads of
the beast, the papal head, would receive a deadly wound (Rev.
13 : 1-3), and thus its persecuting power would be taken away for
a time. This deadly wound was given in 1798, but it will be
healed, as declared in the same scripture, and then its persecutions
will be revived. "Romanism in the Old World and apostate
Protestantism in the New will pursue a similar course toward those
who honor the divine precepts."—Great Controversy, vol. 4. p. 44,5.
Hence it will have the power to persecute, and it will use it.
   4. THE people of God' and His holy law were to be given into
the hands of Rome. That is, the Lord in His wisdom permits
Rome to become dominant and rule with cruel, despotic power, that
the world and the universe of God may see the result of apostasy
in the church of God, and of the church dominating the State.
The Papacy has spoken great words against the Most High in the
papal dogma of infallibility, in the blasphemous titles applied to
the popes, and in many other ways. See "Thoughts on Daniel
and the Revelation." It has made war upon the saints, and slain
from 50,000,000 to 100,000,000, according to good authorities. It
"thinks to change times and the law." (Revised Version.) This
clearly refers to the law of God, which the Papacy cannot really
change, but only thinks to change. This has been literally ful-
filled in its relation to the law of God. It has sought to change
the times, by changing the day observed as the Sabbath, and the
time of commencing the day. (See "Who Changed the Sabbath ?"
No. 107 Bible Students' Library.)
  5. THE period here mentioned is 1,260 years. A time, one year;
24            'ARSONS FROM THE BOOK OF DANIEL.

times, two years; times is plural, hence more than one; and as the
numeral adjective is not used, and as the orginal is dual in form,
we know that "times" here means two "times," or years; dividing
of time, one-half a time would be understood, unless the number
of parts was specified. (See also Dan. 12: 7; Rev. 12: 6, 14.)
Hence we have three and one-half times, or years. This reduced
to days, as the year was anciently counted, twelve months of thirty
days each, would be as follows: One year, 360 days; two years, 720
days; one-half year, 180 days; total, 1,260 days. (See Rev. 11 : 2, 3;
12 : 6, 14; 13 : 5.) As this is prophetic time, and as these days, like
the beasts, are used as symbols, we adopt the Bible rule of aelay
symbolizing a year. (See Num. 14 : 34; Eze. 4 : 4-6.) These scrip-
tures show conclusively the correctness of the above reckoning.
Beginning with A. D. 538, when the papal supremacy was secured
by the overthrow of the Ostrogoths, the 1,260 years would reach
to 1798, the very year when its supremacy was broken.
   6. A DEADLY wound was given to the Papacy in 1798, and its
persecuting power was taken away. Still the pope was a civil
ruler and exercised civil authority for many years, but with lessen-
ing degree, till Sept. 20, 1870, when the last vestige of temporal
power was stripped from him by Victor Emanuel. His temporal
dominion was consumed and destroyed unto the end, that is, till
the end of his dominion, till it ceased. It should be noticed that
this refers to a gradual consuming of the dominion till it is gone,
or destroyed, and not to the sudden destruction of the Papacy
itself when Christ comes. 2 Thess. 2 : 8. Because the dominion
of the Papacy is taken away or consumed until the end of the tem-
poral dominion is reached, it by no means follows that its power
will not be restored so that it will again persecute the people of
God, for the Scriptures clearly teach that the deadly wound will
be healed, and the Papacy will be a living, persecuting power when
Christ conies, as already proved.
   7. THE decree of papal infallibility, July 21, 1870, fulfills with
wonderful exactness the "voice of the great words which the horn
spake." Future lessons will show that the session of the judgment
described in verses 9, 10, began in 1844. Hence, Daniel could
              LESSONS FROM THE 1300K OF DANIEL.                    25


say with great fOrce .and truth, "I beheld then, because of the voice
of the great words which the horn spake."
   8. "ONE like the Son of man." This is an expression used in
symbolic prophecy in referring to Christ, the Son of God. We find
it so used in Rev. 14 : 14. The student will notice that the com-
ing brought to view in our lesson is not Christ's coming to this
earth, but His coming before the Father to receive His kingdom.
This will be before He returns to earth again. (See Luke 19 : 12, 15.)

  21. What will be his fate? Verse 25. (See note 10.)


                              NOTES.
    1. IT was formerly supposed that Belshazzar was the Nabona-
dius of history, who began his reign in B. c. 555, but later histori-
cal researches and inscriptions which have been discovered, indi-
cate quite clearly that Belshazzar was the son of Nabonadius, and
that he was associated with his father as ruler, beginning B. C. 540.
This would bring the third year of Belshazzar's reign (the date of
Daniel's vision recorded in chapter 8), B. c. 538, the same year
that he was killed and the Babylonian Kingdom was overthrown
by Medo-Persia.
   This will explain why the vision of chapter 8 does not include a
symbol of Babylon. Babylon was to be overthrown that very
year, namely, B. c. 538. It will also establish a much closer rela-
tion, chronologically, between the eighth and ninth chapters of
Daniel, because it places the vision of Daniel 9 in B. c. 538, the
same year that he saw the vision of chapter 8. Thus, instead of
the vision of chapter 9 being separated from the vision of chapter
8 by a period of fifteen years, there was only a few months between
them.
    2. THE ram and goat were not symbols simply of the kings of
the countries named, but of the kingdoms over which they ruled.
This is clearly shown by verse 21. In the first part of the verse the
word "king" is evidently used in the sense of "kingdom," while
in the latter part, the first king of the kingdom (Alexander) is
brought to view under the symbol of the great horn between the
goat's eyes.
              LESSONS FROM THE     DOUR OF   DANIEL.             27

    3. THE horn which was higher than the other represented Per-
sia. Persia had the leading influence in the union between the
two nations. It was the stronger and more important power, and
it also came up last, or after Media, as indicated by the higher
horn coming up last, and by Persia coming last in the name of the
kingdom, Medo-Persia, or Media and Persia.
   4. ALEXANDER was the first king of Grecia, and the one who
figured most largely in the history of that kingdom. He is known
in history as Alexander the Great. He rose rapidly to distinction,
and while in the zenith of his power died, at the early age of 32,
n. c. 323. He was fitly represented by the great horn which was
broken.
   5. THE four kingdoms into which Grecia was divided after the
death of Alexander were as follows : Thrace on the north, Syria
on the east, Egypt on the south, and Macedon on .the west. This
division of Grecia is also clearly brought to view in Dan. 11 : 1-4,
where it is said that the Grecian Kingdom "shall be divided toward
the four winds of heaven."
   6.. THE Grecian Kingdom was divided into four parts, symbolized
by the four horns on the head of the goat. It was out of these
horns that Daniel saw this little horn come forth. That is, Rome
having conqueredMacedon, which was symbolized by one of the
horns, Daniel sees it come forth from that country and push its
conquests " toward the south [Egypt], and toward the east [Syria],
and toward the pleasant land [Palestine]." This was exactly ful-
filled by Rome before the first advent of Christ. From the con-
quest of Macedon it rose rapidly to power, and waxed exceeding
great.
  7. THE little horn, which "waxed exceeding great," symbolizes
Rome throughout its entire history, till it is broken without hand.
(See verse 25.) Hence it includes both Pagan and Papal Rome.
Rome conquered Grecia B. c. 168, and came into the field of
prophecy in B. c. 161, when it formed an alliance with the Jews
by what is known as the Jewish League. The Roman legions
when arrayed in battle presented a very fierce and warlike appear-
ance, hence Rome is described as a "king of fierce countenance."
28             LESSONS FROAI THE BOOK OF DANIEL.


The language of Rome was unknown to the Jews, and hence the
expression "understanding dark sentences." (See Deut. 28: 49, 50.)
Rome took away the "daily" or continual transgression, paganism,
and set up the "transgression of desolation," papacy, which was
more iniquitous than paganism. "It cast down some of the host
of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon them." Verse 10.
This no doubt refers to the power 'which Rome exerted in humili-
ating the dignitaries of both church and State, and oppressing the
people of God.
   8. To or against the prince of the host. Verse 11, see margin.
The prince of the host refers to the Saviour, against whom Rome
magnified himself at His first advent.
   9. THE policy of Rome was always to secure powerful allies by
cunning schemes and crafty plans which would unite their inter-
ests with that of Rome, and thus an host was given him, and Rome
was mighty, "but not by his own power." Rome was always
arrayed against the people and work of God. She has prac-
ticed and prospered in carrying out her iniquitous designs, and she
has destroyed the mighty and the holy people, the faithful and
loyal ones, who would not yield to her mandates.
   10. THE Roman power, existing as the Papacy since A. D. 538,
will not be broken or destroyed by human power, or the hand of
man, but it will be broken without hand, that is, by the power of
God manifested in the flaming fire which will consume "that
Wicked" when Christ is revealed from heaven. 2 Thess. 1 : 7-9;
2: 1-8.

                              NOTES.
  1. THAT is, How long will this wicked, desolating power be per-
mitted to carry out its cruel work against the cause and people of
God? It is interesting to note the following points in regard to
the question and answer: (1) The interest manifested by the
heavenly angels in the affairs of this world, as indicated by the
angel's question. (2) The one to whom the question was ad-
dressed was evidently Michael, the first, or chief, of the princes
(Dan. 10: 13), the only one who held (that is, had an understand-
ing), with Gabriel in these things (verse 21). Michael is Christ.
(See Dan. 12:1; 1 Thess. 4:16; Jude 9; John 5:26-29.) It was
certainly very fitting that Gabriel should ask Christ, the Archangel,
for information. (3) Christ's answer is addressed to Daniel, and
30            LESSONS FRONI THE 1100K OF DANIEL.

he recorded it, thus clearly indicating that it was designed for the
comfort and instruction of the people of God in after time.
  As the cleansing of the earthly sanctuary in the type was a work
of judgment, and came at the close of the yearly round of service,
so the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary is also a work of judg-
ment, and constitutes the closing work of Christ as our great high
priest. The 2,300 days, or years, reach, therefore, to the solemn
scenes of the judgment, described in Daniel 7, in immediate con-
nection with which he heard the great words of the Papacy, and
saw it given to the burning flame. Dan. 7: 9-11. It will be
noticed that the answer, instead of giving a period which would
reach to the execution of God's judgments upon the Papacy, and
the deliverance of God's people, gives a period reaching to the in-
vestigative judgment, a brief but indefinite time, just before
Christ comes to execute judgment.
   2. DANIEL sought for the meaning. He knew that the Lord had
a purpose in giving this vision, as well as all the instruction which
the Lord gives to His people through His prophets. The case of
Daniel is an instructive one and his example is worthy of imita-
tion. How differently the prophetic Scriptures are regarded by
many at the present time. But Jesus says of Daniel's prophecy,
"Whoso readeth, let him understand." Matt 24: 15.
   3. THE one who appeared to Daniel in the form of a man was
Gabriel. He came to answer his prayer and explain the meaning
of the vision. That Daniel might know the nature of his errand,
the command is given to Gabriel in Daniel's hearing, "Gabriel,
make this man to understand the vision." This command came
froth the one of whom Gabriel asked the question about the time
and the sanctuary, hence we know it was Christ.
  4. THE vision reached down through the ages to the last days,
even unto the time of the end, hence Gabriel says, " At the time of
the end shall be the vision (Dan. 8: 17), and, "Behold, I will make
thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation; for at
the time appointed the end shall be" (verse 19), that is, the end
of the period (2,300 days), and then a brief period of judgment,
             LESSONS FROM THE BOOK OF DANIEL.                    31

the cleansing of the sanctuary, and then the sanctuary and host
would no longer be trodden underfoot, for Jesus would come and
deliver His people and establish His kingdom. (See note 1.)       •
  5. THE vision of the evening and the morning, or of the even-
ings and mornings, as it is rendered in the Revised Version, is the
vision of the days, referring evidently to the 2,300 days of verse
14. In the Revised Version verse 14 is rendered, "Unto two
thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings; then shall
the sanctuary be cleansed." In the record of creation we read
that "the evening and the morning were the first day," the "even-
ing and the morning were the second day," etc., hence the angel
speaks of the vision of the 2,300 days as "the vision of the even-
ings and mornings."
  6. GABRIEL explained the symbols in chapter 8, but did not
explain the 2,300 days; and as the time was made the leading
feature of the vision by the striking manner in which it was pre-
sented, Daniel could truly •say that he "was astonished at the
vision, but none understood it." That the time in connection
with the event at its close is the most ivortant part of the vision
is proved by the fact that the time gives name to the vision.
Gabriel calls it the vision of the evenings and mornings, or of the
clays, referring to the 2,300 days.

  21. To what date would we be brought then for the end of the
2,300 days?-The autumn of 1844. (See note 11.)

                            NOTES.
   1. As EXPLAINED in note 1 of lesson 10, the third year of Bel-
shazzar was the last year of his reign, and hence coincided with
the first year of Darius. This brings the vision of chapter 9
in the same year as the vision of chapter 8, hence only a few
             LESSONS FROM THE BOOK OF DANIEL.                    33


months apart. This makes a close connection between the two
chapters and the prophetic periods found in them, and greatly
strengthens the argument in favor of the seventy weeks being a
part of the 2,300 days.
    2. DANIEL'S mind still rested on the vision of chapter 8, and
especially upon that portion which had not been explained, namely,
the holy city and its sanctuary, and the time. In fulfilling the
commission which Gabriel had received to make Daniel understand
the vision; he would certainly begin at the point where he stopped
in his explanation as recorded in the previous chapter. He had
explained the symbols, and now he begins at once to give an
exposition of the time. See verse 24.
    3. THE commandment to restore and build Jerusalem con-
sisted of three decrees (Ezra 6: 14), the last of which, and hence
the one which completed the commandment and from which we
must begin to reckon, was the decree of Artaxerxes Longimanus,
B. c. 457. See Ezra 7 for the decree, the date of which is in the
margin.
    4. FROM B. c. 457 sixty-nine weeks, or 483 years, would reach to
A. D. 27. In the fall of that year Jesus was baptized, at which time
He was anointed by the Holy Spirit. He was then the Messiah,
which means the Anointed One. See date in the margin of Mark
1 : 14, 15.
    5. NATURALLY the first division of the seventy weeks would be
devoted to restoring and building the city. Hence the first seven
weeks are allotted to building the wall of the city, which was
accomplished in B. c. 408, in the reign of Darius Nothus.
    6. AFTER placing before Daniel the great events connected
with the seventy weeks, the restoration of the city and the sanctu-
ary service, the coming of the Messiah, and His cutting off, and His
causing the typical services to cease by the sacrifice of Himself, he
 then reveals to Daniel the utter destruction of the city and sanc-
 tuary toward which he and his people looked with such fond
 desire. In this way the great truth was taught that the sanctuary
 to be cleansed at the end of the 2,300 days cannot be the one
 destroyed in A,D. 70 by the Romans under Titus,
34            LESSONS FROM THE BOOK OF DANIEL.

    7. CHRIST was to confirm the covenant with many for one
 week. This was the last week of the seventy. Seven weeks were
 allotted to the building of the wall, then sixty-two weeks more
 would reach to Messiah. These added would make sixty-nine
 weeks, which would reach to A. D. 27. Then for three years and a
 half, or during His public ministry, Christ confirmed the covenant
in person among the Jewish people. This refers of course to the
new covenant, the blood of which was shed on Calvary. During
the last three years and a half, or the last half of the seventieth
week, the work of confirming the new covenant was given to the
apostles. Christ did the work through them. They were His
agents. This work of confirming the new covenant among the
Jewish people for one week began in the autumn of A. D. 27, and
ended in the autumn of A. D. 34. Verse 26 speaks of Messiah
being cut off. Verse 27 tells definitely when, by saying that "in
the midst of the week He shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to
cease." This evidently refers to His death, when all the typical
sacrifices met their antitype in Christ, the Lamb of God.
    8. SEVENTY weeks were cut off from the first part of the 2,300
days. They related especially to the Jews and Jerusalem. (See
verse 24.) The seventy weeks ended in A. D. 34. This date is
marked by the martyrdom of Stephen, the rejection of the gospel
by the Jewish Sanhedrin, and a great persecution of the Christians,
which caused them to be scattered abroad, and they went every-
where preaching the word. Acts 8: 4. The next year, A. D. 35
(see Acts 9), Saul was converted and called to be the apostle to the
Gentiles, and the gospel has since been preached among all nations,
and not to the Jews only.
    9. WE conclude that the seventy weeks of Daniel 9 form a part
of the 2,300 days of Daniel 8, and begin at the same time, for the
following reasons: (1) Gabriel came to explain the vision. (See
Dan. 9: 21-23.) This must have been the vision of the previous
chapter, because Gabriel bad been commissioned to explain that
vision, and he had not completed the work, on account of Daniel's
condition. Dan. 8:27. (2) The only portion of the vision whi01
he did. not explain in chapter 8 was that which pertained to
              LESSONS FROM THE BOOK OF DANIEL.                    35

the time, and when he begins his explanation in chapter 9 he
begins at once on the question of time. Dan. 9:23, 24. (3) If
the seventy weeks and its subdivisions form no part of the 2,300
clays, then Gabriel failed to explain the vision, and hence failed to
do the work he was commanded to do. • (4) Unless the seventy
weeks begin at the same time as the 2,300 days, they would in no
way assist in explaining when these days would begin or termi-
nate, Hence we are held to the conclusion that the seventy weeks
begin at the same time as the 2,300 days, and that they were given
to explain the vision and enable the student of prophecy to know
when the solemn session of the judgment will begin.
  10. WHEN seventy weeks, or 490 years, had passed away, there
would remain 1,810 years of the 2,300, because 490 deducted from
2,800 leaves 1,810.
  11. As the seventy weeks, or 490 years, reached to A. D. 34, the
remainder of the 2,300 years, or 1,810 years, would reach to A. D.
1844, because 1,810 years added to 34 would make 1,844. Hence
the 2,300 days began B.. c. 457 and ended A. D. 1844. Some
have difficulty in reaching this conclusion, because 457, the years
before Christ, taken from 2,300 leaves only 1,843. They cannot
see how 1844 can be the true date. The difficulty is imaginary,
however, and not real. Please notice that it would take 457 full
years before Christ and 1,843 full years after Christ to make 2,300
years. Hence if the period of 2,300 years began with the first day
of a, c. 457, they would not end till the first day of 1844. But
as this period did not begin till the fall of B. c. 457, or when the
year was about half gone, it would not terminate till the autumn
of 1844. Reckoning from the autumn of B. c. 4.57, there would
be only 456/ years before A. D. 1, and reckoning from A. D. 1 to
the autumn of 1844 would be only 1,843/ years. Adding 456/
years, the time before A. D. 1, to 1,843/ years, the time after that
date, would make just 2,300 years.

                             NOTES.
  1. THE time of the end is not the end, but a brief period com-
mencing at a certain time and reaching to Christ's second coming.
This period, the time of the end, begins with the close of the papal
persecution, viz., in 1798, when the Papacy received the deadly
wound. Rev. 13 : 3.
  2. "THE time of the end" is marked especially as a time
when "many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be in-
creased." This does not refer to the great amount of travel that
will be carried on and an increase of worldly wisdom and knowl-
edge in general, although these things may be seen in the social
world in a remarkable degree. The book of Daniel was to be
closed "till the time of the end." Then "many shall run to
and fro," that is, run to and fro through the book, searching its
pages diligently, and thus "knowledge [of the Scriptures] shall lie
increased." (See "Facts for the Times," page 59, fourth edition.)
This view is also confirmed by the statements in verse 9, that the
wicked will do wickedly, and none of the wicked shall understand,
but the wise shall understand.
  3. THAT is, How long will it be till we reach " the time of the
end," when the long period of persecution will cease, and God's
people will be free to study the word of God, and these things
which have been a source of wonder and astonishment to them
will be more fully understood?
  4. Tins period is identical with that in Dan. 7: 25 and Rev.
12 : 6, 14, which we have found to be 1,260 prophetic days, or literal
years, beginning A. D. 538 and ending A. D. 1798. The One who
answered this question is evidently Christ, the same One who
answered the question relating to time in Dan. 8: 13.
   5. THAT is, When will God's people be delivered from these
terrible troubles and persecutions?
  6. THE "daily," or paganism ("sacrifice" is a supplied word), was
taken away in A. D. 508. This was to prepare the way for the
setting up, or establishment, of the "abomination that maketh deso-
38            LESSONS FROM THE BOOR OF DANIEL.

 late," cr the Papacy, in A. D. 538. (See margin.) To A. D. 508
.add 1,290 prophetic days, or literal years, and we are brought to
 A. D. 1798, the same date to which the 1,260 years extend. (See
 "Thoughts on Daniel and the Revelation," chapters 11 and 12.)
  7. THAT is, beginning at the same date as the 1,290 years, namely,.
A. D. 508, the 1,335 prophetic days, or literal years, would extend to
A. D. 1843, at which time a great blessing came to God's people as
they feasted upon the book of Daniel, which was then open, and
increased in the knowledge of the prophetic word, and rejoiced
in the clear evidences of the Saviour's soon coming to redeem
His people. Luke 21: 28.

  8. " TILL the end be;" that is, till the end of all these great
prophetic periods. This would certainly include the 2,300 days of
Daniel 8, which ended in 1844, as well as the shorter periods, which
ended prior to that time. Then, in 1844, Daniel and all the right=
eous dead stand in their lot, or the place decided by the Judge, in
the judgment, which began when that date was reached.

                    A Study of the Book of Daniel.
         A new pamphlet on the important prophecies of Daniel has
     just been issued as No. 131 of Bible Students' Library.
         This publication is a running commentary on the book of
     Daniel, nearly every verse in the whole book being considered.
     Chapters 2, 3, 6 and 7 are dwelt upon at greater length than some
     of the others, on account of their importance. The comments on
     chapters 3 and 6 bring in some excellent thoughts on the
                  PRINCIPLES OP RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.
         This pamphlet will be invaluable as an aid to the study of the
     Sabbath school lessons for the second quarter (April to July, 1895),
     and 25,000 copies should be used in our Sabbath schools during the
     study of these lessons.
       "The Sure Word of Prophecy" will contain about 100 pages, with
     8 or 10 fine illustrations.
