 LESSONS ON THE SANCTUARY
                                 FOR

              SENIOR CLASSES.
                     January 5 to March 30, 1895.


                        INTRODUCTORY NOTE.
     THE subject of the sanctuary is a very interesting and important
  one. One of the pioneer laborers in connection with the closing
  work of the gospel, Elder J. N. Andrews, well said, " Ibis like a
  golden thread that runs all through the Bible." When we remem-
  ber that in it the whole plan of salvation centers, that an under-
  standing of it is necessary to a knowledge of present truth and the
   work of God for this time, that it is indeed the key to our position.
' and that the prayerful study of it opens before us_a. vast and fruit-
   ful field of Bible truth concerning which the great majority of the
   Christian world is confessedly ignorant, then we will, perhaps, bet,
   ter appreciate its value and the importance of giving it careful and
   thorough study.
      It has been several years since our Sabbath schools have studied
   the subject of the sanctuary, and with the increased light and truth
   which we now enjoy as a people, its study ought to be of great-in-
   terest and profit to us all. This will surely be the case with those
   who reverence the Lord and His sanctuary, and take up the study
   of the subject with true humility, a spirit of prayer, and a desire
   to know the truth as it is in Jesus.
      The lessons are necessarily framed somewhat differently than the
   book study -Which we have had in our Sabbath schools during the
   last year and a half. The lessons on First Peter, First John, and the
                                                            (8)
4                 LESSONS ON THE SANCTUARY.

book of Luke, treat those scriptures chapter by chapter and verse
by verse. Now, as we take up topical study again, it is necessary
to refer at the close of each question to the text or the note which
answers it. The number of lessons being limited to thirteen, the
subject cannot be brought out as fully as we might desire; but it
was thought that it would hardly be profitable to spend six months
on that subject in our Sabbath schools at the present time; hence
only thirteen lessons have been prepared.
  In our present study of the sanctuary we have not had space, or
thought it necessary, to consider all those scriptures that speak of
the temple of Solomon and its subsequent history. They will not
materially aid us in securing a knowledge of the subject in its
practical bearing upon God's people at the present time.
  The lesson writer would especially urge upon all the importance
of heeding the excellent instructions in regard to Bible study given
in the senior lessons on the book of Luke. They are most excel-
lent, and are worthy of study and preservation. For books of ref-
erence in studying these lessons we recommend " Patriarchs and
Prophets," " The Atonement," " The Sanctuary and Its Cleans-
ing," " Early Writings," " Great Controversy," vol. 4, and
"Christ Our Advocate."


        LESSON I.—January 5, 1895.
            THE SANCTUARY OF THE BIBLE.

                         OUTLINE LESSON.
  THIS outline lesson is placed before the mind at the commence-
ment of our study of the subject, believing that it will be helpful
in the lessons that will follow. This lesson is short, and the stu-
dent should become familiar with every text used in it; and be able
to locate them without hesitation. All of them are important
proof texts, and should be remembered.
   1. What is the meaning of the word " sanctuary "?—"A holy
place, a sacred place, a dwelling place for the Most High." See
Ex. 25:8, and " Webster's Dictionary."
                  LESSONS ON THE SANCTUARY.                      5
    2 How many times is this word used in the Bible?-146 times.
    3. By what other names is it called in the Scriptures?-(1) Tab-
ernacle. See Heb. 8: 1, 2. (2) Temple. See Rev- 11 : 19 and
15 : 5.
    4 For what purpose are the Scriptures written?-Rom. 15 : 4;
2 Tim. 3 : 16.
    5. What, then, must we conclude in reference to the subject of
the sanctuary?
    6. What has tie sanctuary been from the beginning? Jer
17 : 12.
     7. Where Is it located? Ps, 102: 19.
    8. What did the Lord command the people to do in the time of
Moses? Ex. 25: 8.
    9. For what purpose was it to be built?
 " 10. How was Moses instructed to make it? Ex. 26: 30; Heb.
8 . 5.
   11 Of what was it a pattern? Heb. 9: 23.
   12. What is said of the sanctuary in heaven? Heb. 8 : 1, 2.
   13. How does it compare with the one which Moses built? Verse
2; 9.11.
   14. What relation does Christ sustain to it? Heb. 8 : 1, 2.
   15. When did- He begin His priestly work?-After He ascended.
See Heb. 4 : 14; 8: 1; 9 : 24.
   16. Why did He not exercise the priestly office while He was
here on the earth? Heb. 8 : 4. Note
   17. Why was there no ministration in the heavenly temple be-
fore Christ came? Heb. 9 : 3. Note 2.
   18. When Christ finishes His work as priest, and redemption is
completed, how will God dwell with His people? Rev. 21 : 1-3.
Note 3.
   19. What does John say of that city? Verse 22t
   20. Whose throne will be in it? Verse 5; 22: 1, 3,


                             NOTRS.
  1, Ix the plan of God the typical services end offerings of the
former dispensation were to extend to the death of Christ, which

took place at the close of His earthly life. He placed before us in•
His spotless example " the way, the truth, and the life; " but He,
could not minister His blood before it was shed, and He could not
officiate as priest at that time, because He was not of the tribe of
Levi. Heb. 7 : 12-14.
   2. THE typical service which was performed in the worldly
sanctuary was a shadow of a service which was still future. Type
reaches antitype, but cannot exist at the same time. The shadow
is past when the substance is reached. They cannot occupy the.
same space; hence Christ's ministration in the heavenly temple
could not begin while the earthly sanctuary and its typical services
was being carried forward under the divine sanction. It is also,
evident that the Lamb of God must first be slain before His preciouss,
blood could be ministered in our behalf. This did not prevent.
those who lived before Christ died from being benefited by His,
sacrifice, because by faith they grasped the saving truth that Christ,
was a Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. Rev. 13 : S.

  3. FROM the Scriptures we learn that God will finally dwell with
men indeed, not as in the days of ancient Israel, by a symbol —
the shekinah—in a temple made with hands, having in it furniture
which reminds of sin, and a service performed for its removal; but.
He will actually dwell with men by His personal presence, in the
New Jerusalem, " our Father's house," with many mansions, all
prepared for the eternal home of the redeemed by the One who will
soon come again to receive us to Himself. John 14 : 1-3.

                             NOTES.
   1. THERE is an important lesson for us in the instruction which
the Lord gave His people in regard to the offerings for the sanc-
 tuary. They were to offer willingly, We are to give " not
grudgingly, or of necessity; for God loveth a cheerful giver," 2
Cor. 9 : 7. We may think, perhaps, that ancient Israel was a very
wicked and rebellious people (and they were at times, and espe-
cially in the time of Christ), but their liberality in making offer-
ings for the sanctuary is especially mentioned in the Scriptures.
Ex. 36 : 5-7; 1 Chron. 29 : 9-17. We cannot afford to give grudg-
ingly, or rob God in tithes and offerings, as the Lord declares we
have done, and suffer His curse as a result. Mal. 3 : 8, 9. He
wants us to cease robbing Him, that He may pour us out a bless-
ing that we will not have room to receive. _ Verse 10. When we
remember that the Jewish people gave about one-third of all their
income to support the work of God (" Testimonies," vol. 3, page
395), and that the early church in the days of the apostles gave all
to carry the gospel, we ought to be provoked unto love and good
works, cheerfully give of our substance, and take joyfully the spoil-
ing of our goods, knowing that we " have in heaven a better and
an enduring substance." Heb. 10: 34. And now, as we are right
on the borders of the promised land, and can carry nothing over,
we should sell and give alms, that we may lay up treasure in
heaven, and have our affections and interests center there, instead
of being dwellers on the earth. Luke 12 : 33-36.
   2. " SHITTIM WOOD."—The wood of the shittah tree. "A
tree that furnished the precious wood of Which the ark, tables,
altars, boards, etc., of the Jewish tabernacle were made, now
believed to have been the wood of the Acacia Seyal, which is hard,
fine grained, and yellowish brown in color."—Webster. Tim
original word is translated acacia in the Revised Version.
   3. "CuBrr."—There is no general agreement among the author-
ities in regard to the length of the cubit. The variation ranges
from eighteen to twenty-two inches, hence the dimensions of the
sanctuary and everything connected with it can be easily ascertained
approximately in feet and inches.

  4. " THE sides of the tabernacle westward." Of course on the
west there could be but one side, more properly, end. The
Revised Version renders this, " The hinder part of the tabernacle
westward," which is evidently correct, as the tabernacle faced the
east.

                              NOTES.
   1. " TACHES."—These were clasps which hooked into the loops
and joined the curtains together. The word is rendered " clasps "
in the Revised Version. The clasps for the linen curtains were
made of gold, while those used for the curtains of goats' hair were
made of brass. Ex. 26 : 6, 11.
   2. " FOR a covering for the tabernacle." It will be noticed that
this expression conveys the idea that this curtain of goats' hair did
not form a part of the tabernacle proper, but was a covering for
it. The Revised Version renders it, "for a tent over the taber-
nacle." This expresses the thought still more plainly. The Com-
mon Version and the Revised Version both say, " Couple the tent
together," in verse 11, and both versions say that " he made cur-
tains of goats' hair for the tent over the tabernacle,".in Ex. 36 : 14.
We would also call attention to the fact that, while in Ex. 26 : 6 it
says the linen curtains "shall be one tabernacle," in verse 11 it
says, when referring to the curtains of goats' hair, that the taches
" couple the tent together, that it may be one." Also in verse 13
it speaks of the "curtains of the tent," and in verse 14 the rams'
skins are called " a covering for the tent."
   3. " TnE roof of the tabernacle and the tent." There is no
general agreement among Bible scholars as to how the curtains
were placed over the upright boards which constituted the sides
and west end of the tabernacle. As the question is not one of
practical importance, and we have no reliable data concerning it
outside of the Bible, we will not occupy space presenting the
various views on the subject that have been advocated.

  4. THE Lord evidently had a design in having the sanctuary
and temple face the east. Sun worship was the great rival of the
worship of the true God, and its worshipers always worshiped the
sun towards the east. Those who came to the sanctuary or temple
to worship must come to the door or front of the sanctuary, with
their faces toward it, for in that sanctuary God's presence was
manifested. In so doing they would turn their back upon secs
worship and all the idolatry that centered in it; whereas, those
who apostatized from God and worshiped the sun towards the
east, as was their custom, turned their back on God and His wor-
ship, and this the Lord counted as the greatest abomination that
could be committed. Eze. 8: 5-16.

                           NOTES.
   1. THE experience of David in carrying the ark was well cal-
culated to impress him with the importance of carrying out the
Lord's instructions, without presuming to vary from them. God
is particular. He gives directions for His worship and His work,
and they are the wisest and best that'can be given. They are not
arbitrary in their nature, but they are exactly adapted to meet
man in his fallen condition, and raise him to eternal glory and
immortal life. Again and again has the Lord sought to impress
our minds with the importance of implicit obedience to His
requirements. Numerous examples are given us in His word which
illustrate the fact that He is particular. The cases of our first
parents, Cain and Abel, Nadab and Abihu, Israel's observance of
the Sabbath at the falling of the manna (Exodus 16), Ananias and
                  LESSONS ON THE SANCTUARY.                     13

Sapphira, and others, might be cited. Let us ever remember that
the willing and obedient shall eat the good of the land. Isa. 1 : 19.
   2. IT is not without significance that the mercy seat and the law
of God beneath it were so closely associated, and that God's pres-
ence was manifested just above them between the cherubim. Here
all the service of the sanctuary centered. . Here the presence, char-
acter, and government of God were represented. The law of God
is the "justice and judgment" which are the habitation of His
throne. Ps. 89 : 14. It contains the eternal principles which form
His character and are the foundation of His government. These
include mercy and love as well as justice, for Gbd's law is the
reflection of all the attributes of His character. The Saviour
classes mercy as one of the weightier matters of the law. Matt.
23 : 23. But while the law contains the principle of mercy and
requires it of all, yet it does not fully reveal it to fallen man. It
reveals man's guilt, and gives the knowledge of sin, but it is by
the gospel and in Jesus Christ that the character of God and His
law is fully revealed. The cover of the ark was called the mercy
seat, because here mercy had her seat, and sin, the transgression
of the law, beneath the mercy seat, was pardoned and removed by '
virtue of the blood of the atoning sacrifice which was there min-
istered. " Thus in the work of Christ for our redemption, sym-
bolized by the sanctuary service, mercy and truth are met
together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.' " Ps.
85 : 10.
   3. " THE showbread was kept ever before the Lord as a per-
petual offering. Thus it was a part of the daily sacrifice. It was
called showbread, or bread of the presence,' because it was ever
before the face of the Lord. It was an acknowledgment of man's
dependence upon God for both temporal and spiritual food, and
that it is received only through the mediation of Christ. God had
fed Israel in the wilderness with bread from heaven, and they
were still dependent upon His bounty both for temporal food and
spiritual blessings. Both the manna and the showbread pointed
to Christ, the living Bread, who is ever in the presence of God for
us. He Himself said, ' I am the living Bread which came down
from heaven.' Frankincense was placed upon the loaves. °When

the bread was removed every Sabbath, to be replaced by fresh
loaves, the frankincense was burned upon the altar as a memorial
before God."-Patriarchs and Prophets, page 354.

never all extinguished at one time, but shed their light by day
and by night."-Patriarchs and Prophets, page 348,

                             NOTES.
  1. THERE is great comfort and encouragement in the lesson
taught in this verse; and in Ex. 31 : 1-6, for those who are called
to do the work of God. He gives them the wisdom and skill
which they need to do the work acceptably. " The meek will He
guide in judgment; and the meek will He teach His way." Ps.
25 : 9. " If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that
giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be
given him." James 1 : 5.
    2. " OVER the ephod was the breastplate, the most sacred.of the
priestly vestments. This was of the same material as the ephod.
It was in .the form of a square, measuring a span, and Was sus-
pended from the shoulders by a cord of blue, from golden rings.
The border was formed of a variety of precious stones, the same
that formed the twelve foundations of the city of God. Within
the border were twelve stones, set in gold, arranged in rows of four,
and, like those on the shoulder-pieces, engraved with the names of
the tribes. The Lord's direction was, 'Aaron shall bear the names
of the children of Israel in the breastplate of judgment upon his
heart, when he goeth in unto the holy place, for a memorial before
the Lord continually.' So Christ, the great High Priest, pleading
His blood before the Father in the sinner's behalf, bears upon His
heart the name of every repentant, believing soul. Says the
Psalmist, I am poor and needy, yet the Lord thinketh upon me.'
    "At the right and left of the breastplate were two large stones
of great brilliancy. These were known as the Urim and Thum-
mim. By them the will of God was made known through the
high priest. When questions were brought for decision before the
 Lord, a halo of light encircling the precious stone at the right was
a token of the divine consent or approval, while a cloud shadowing
 the stone at the left was an evidence of denial or disapprobation,"
 ,--Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 351.

                              NOTES.
  1. " THE daily ministration embraced the regular morning and
evening burnt offering (Ex. 29 : 38-43), the burning of sweet
incense on the golden altar of incense every morning when the high
priest dressed the lamps, and every evening when he lighted them
(Exodus 30), the additional work appointed for the Sabbaths of the
Lord, and the annual sabbaths, new moons, and feasts (Numbeas,
chapters 28, 29), besides the particular work to be accomplished for
individuals as they should present their offerings throughout the
year."—The,Sanctuary and Its Cleansing, p. 203.
   2. " IN the sin offerings presented during the year, a substitute
had been accepted in the sinner's stead; but the blood of the vic-
tim had not made full atonement for the sin. It had only provided
a means by which the sin was transferred to the sanctuary. By
the offering of blood the sinner acknowledged the authority of the
law, confessed the guilt of his transgression, and expressed his faith
in Him who was to take away the sin of the world; but he was not
entirely released from the condemnation of the law. On the day
of atonement the high priest, having taken an offering for the con-
gregation, went into the most holy place with the blood, and
sprinkled it upon the mercy seat, above the tables of the law.
Thus the claims of the law, which demanded the life of the sinner,
were satisfied. Then'in his character of mediator the priest took
 the sins upon himself, and, leaving the sanctuary, he bore with
him the burden of Israel's guilt. At the door of the tabernacle he
laid his hands upon the head of the scapegoat, and confessed over
 him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their trans-
18                LESSONS ON THE SANCTUARY.

gressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat.'
And as the goat bearing these sins was sent away, they were with
him regarded as forever separated from the people."—Patriarchs
and Prophets, pp. 355, 356.
  3. THE seventh month, Jewish time, comes in the autumn of
the year, because the sacred year, as reckoned by the Jews, began
in the spring.
   4. WHEN Christ, the Lamb of God, died on Calvary, the earthly
sanctuary and its service had fulfilled its purpose. Type had
reached antitype, and " the veil of the temple was rent in twain
from the.top to the bottom." Matt. 27 : 50, 51. This miraculous
token was to signify that the temple at Jerusalem was no longer to
be considered as the center of acceptable worship to God, although
the temple service was kept up by the Jewish people until the de-
struction of Jerusalem by the Romans under Titus, in A. D. 70.

  20. What is said of the blood which lie offers? Heb. 9 : 11-14.
  21. What is said of the efficacy of His sacrifice and priestly serv-
ice? Heb. 7 : 27; 9: 25, 26, 28; 10: 10-14. Note 3.

                               NOTES.
   1. THERE has been much speculation concerning Melchisedec,
especially as to who Ile was. This has been wholly unnecessary.
The sacred record is clear and explicit. It says that he was king
of Salem and priest of the Most High God. Some have contended
that he was Sham. But this view contradicts the testimony of
Scripture, for that says that he has no genealogy (Heb. 7 : 3), and
Shem's genealogy_is plainly stated (Gen. 5 : 32). If the genealogy
of Melchisedec can be traced, or ascertained, then the truthfulness
of the Scripture record would be disproved, for that declares that
he has none, and, besides, Christ would not then be a priest after the
order of Melchisedec. All should be satisfied to leave the matter
where the Scriptures leave it, and not be wise above what is written.
   2. THE fact that Christ differed from the priests in the former
dispensation in no way militates against the truth that their mini3-
tration as priests was an example of His. Christ was a priest after
the order of Melchisedec, that is, He had no predecessor, and will
have no successor. " He ever liveth to make intercession." Heb.
7 : 25.
   3. CHRIST'S sacrifice and ministration are so efficacious that with
each it is "once for all." One sacrifice on Calvary was sufficient,
and He ministers in each apartment of the heavenly sanctuary
" once for all."

  20. What resurrection is this called? Rev. 20 : 4-6.
  21. What is done with Satan at that time? Verses 1-3. Note 9.

                             NOTES.
  1. IT was a work of judgment. It -was so regarded by ancient
Israel. The people were to afflict or humble their souls, or be cut
off from Israel. Lev. 23 : 29.
  2. SIN has been conveyed to the sanctuary by the ministration
of the priest, as shown by the type, and it must be removed or
cleansed by blood. The sanctuary is, therefore, to be cleansed
from sin, and not from physical impurity.
   3. EVERY work will be brought into judgment. This shows
that sins are not blotted out at conversion. They remain on the
books of record till the judgment, the great antitypical day of
atonement, the cleansing of the heavenly temple. " The,blood of
Christ, while it was to release the repentant sinner from the con-
demnation of the law, was not to cancel the sin; it would stand on
record in the sanctuary until the final day of atonement; so in the
type, the blood of the sin offering removed the sin from the peni-
tent, but it rested in the sanctuary until the day of atonement."—
Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 357.
  4, JUDGMENT will begin first upon the people of God, and their
cases must be decided before Christ comes, because the saints are to
judge the world after He tomes. Dan. 7 : 22; 1 Cor. 6 : 7-3; 4: 5;
Rev. 20 : 4.
   5. " IN the great day of final award the dead are to be judged
out of those things which were written in the books, according to
their works.' Then, by virtue of the atoning blood of Christ, the
sins of all the truly penitent will be blotted from the books of
heaven. Thus the sanctuarywill be freed, or cleansed, from the
record of sin. In the type this great work of atonement, or blot-
ting out of sins, was represented by the services of the day of
atonement,—the cleansing of the earthly sanctuary, which was
accomplished by the removal, by virtue of the blood of the sin
offering, of the sins by which it had been polluted."—Patriarchs
and Prophets, pp. 357, 358.

   6. THIS scripture locates the time of the blotting out of sin just
before the second coming of Christ. He completes His priestly
work before He comes. The blotting out of the sins of His people
is, therefore, just before He comes to gather His elect.
  7. CHRIST, as our great High Priest, bears our sins from the heav-
enly temple, as indicated in the type, and they are placed upon
the head of Satan, the antitypical scapegoat. " Since Satan is the
originator of sin, the direct instigator of all the sins that caused
the death of the Son of God, justice demands that Satan shall suf-
fer the final punishment. Christ's work for the redemption of men
and the purification of the universe from sin, will be closed by the
removal of sin from the heavenly sanctuary and the placing of
these sins upon Satan, who will bear the final penalty. So in the
typical service the yearly round of ministration closed with the
purification of the sanctuary, and the confession of the sins on the
head of the scapegoat. "—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 358.
  8. IN the typical service the sins of God's people were placed on
the head of the scapegoat at the close of - the yearly round of serv-
ice. It was an act performed after the sanctuary was cleansed, and
the priest had come out from it, bearing the sins of the people.
Hence the sins of God's people will be placed upon Satan at the
close of our Saviour's priestly service in the heavenly temple.
   9. AT the resurrection of the just, which takes place at the com-
mencement of the thousand years, when Christ comes the second
time, Satan is cast by an angel into the bottomless pit--abussos—
abyss (see Revised Version), which means a waste, void, uninhab-
ited place. This was very plainly symbolized by the scapegoat
being sent away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness, into
a land not inhabited. Lev. 16 : 21, 22. When Christ comes, the
righteous will be taken to heaven (1 Thess.. 4: 16, 17; John 14:
1-3), and the living wicked will be destroyed (Isa. 24 ; 1-3; Jer. 4 :
19-27; 2 Thess. 2: 8). Thus the earth will be desolate and waste
till the wicked are raised from the dead at the end of the thousand,
years, Rev. 20: 5, first clause, 3, 7, 8.

9 : 24. Note 5.
  26. To what people is reference made in this verse?


                             NOTES.
  1. IN the very nature of things judgment must follow a time of
probation. God's judgment of this world must, therefore, come
at the close of its history. This is also evident when we remember
that the influence of a man's deeds continues after his death, and
will continue till the close of probation, when the decree goes forth
which is found in Rev. 22 : 11. His influence' will, therefore, be
considered in the judgment, because it is a result of his work.
Eccl. 12 : 13, 14.
  2. THE day of judgment is not to be understood as a day of
twenty-four hours. The Scriptures speak of the day of the Lord
(Joel 2 : 1, 11), and the day of salvation (2 Cor. 6 : 2). These are
long periods of time, and the day of judgment which God has •
appointed involves work that extends over a period of many years,
as the Bible plainly teaches.
   3. WE have already found that the cleansing bf the sanctuary
is a work of judgment. Hence when the Lord reveals the time
when the cleansing of the sanctuary is to take place, he reveals •the
time when the judgment is to begin.
   4. As THE angel began on the subject of time when he came to
 Daniel to explain the vision, the seventy weeks must form a part of
 the time mentioned in the vision. And as the instruction concern-
 ing the seventy weeks would not aid in any way in locating the
 commencement of the 2300 days unless they were to begin at the
 same time, we are held to the conclusion that the two periods coin-
 cide at their commencement. " Seventy weeks are determined,"
-literally, " cut off." See " Sanctuary and Its Cleansing," chap-
 ter 6.
    b. " To FINISH the transgression." That is, to fill up the cup of
26                 LESSONS ON THE SANCTUARY.

 Israel's iniquity. This condition was reached at the first advent of
 Christ. Matt. 23: 29-38.        To make an end of sins." This
 Christ did, in the sense of the prophecy, by making provision for
 putting away sin by the sacrifice of Himself. Heb. 9 : 26. " To
make reconciliation for iniquity." This was done by Christ tak-
ing upon Himself the penalty of sin, that the law might be hon-
ored and the transgressor reconciled to God. 1 Cor. 15 : 3. " To
bring in everlasting righteousness." The righteousness of God,
which was seen in the spotless life of Jesus Christ, and which is
given to every believer. Rom. 3 : 21-25. " To seal up the vision
and prophecy." Evidently the words " seal up " are used in the
sense of making sure instead of making secret. The seventy
weeks were given to explain the vision and not to darken it, to
reveal truth and not to cover it. They test every theory and view
that are advanced concerning the 2300 days. They expose every
false application, and make sure the true one. This will appear
when its divisions are considered. Dan 7 : 25-27. " To anoint
the Most Holy." The earthly sanctuary was to be anointed before
the ministration in it could begin. Ex. 30 : 25-30. So, after the
death of Christ, He ascended 10. heaven to minister as our High
Priest in the sanctuary, preparatory to which, according to the type,
it would be anointed.

    1. What event marked the commencement of the seventy
weeks? Dan. 9: 25.

Note 5.
   13. What was the date of Christ's manifestation as the Messiah?

28                LESSONS ON TUE SANCTUARY.

  23. In point of time how did the service in the most holy place
compare with that in the holy place? — It was very brief.
  24. What must we conclude, then, with regard to the service
in the heavenly sanctuary? Note 9.
  25. What solemn announcement will soon be made? Rev. 22:
11, 12.

                             NOTES.
  1. THE date of the decree recorded in Ezra 7 is one of the best
established dates in the Scriptures. It has been proved correct
by the concurrent agreement of more than twenty eclipses. See
" Sanctuary and Its Cleansing," chapter seven.
  2. THE building of the wall in troublnus times refers, evidently,
to the carrying out of the commandment to restore and build Jeru-
salem after the decree of Artaxerxes in B. c. 457. The seven
weeks, or forty-nine years, would, therefore, end in 408 B. c.
lioubigant's translation of verse 25, as quoted by Dr. Adam
Clarke, is quite clear on this point. It reads as follows: " Know,
therefore, and understand: From the edict which shall be pro-
mulgated, to return and rebuild Jerusalem, there shall be seven
weeks. Then it shall be fully rebuilt, with anxiety in difficult
times. Thence to the Prince Messiah there shall be sixty-two
weeks."
  3. THE sacrifice and oblation, so far as acceptable service in the
temple was concerned, was caused to cease by Christ's sacrifice on
Calvary, because they all met their fulfillment in the death of the
Lamb of God.
  4. THE seven weeks would end in B. c. 408; the sixty-two weeks
would end in A. D. 27; the middle of the seventieth week, in A. D.
31; and the end of the seventy weeks, in A. D. 34.
  5. THE dates harmonize exactly with the records of history, and
thus the seventy weeks, with its various divisions, seal up or make
sure the vision and the prophecy, by showing the correctness of a
right interpretation and application of the time, and by detecting
and exposing all false interpretations and applications. This will
                  LESSONS ON THE SANCTUARY.'                      29

be readily seen if we begin our reckoning at any other date than
B. c. 457.
   6. " MESSIAH " means "anointed One." Jesus was anointed
by the Holy Spirit at His baptism. Matt. 3: 16; Acts 10: 38.
Hence the sixty-two weeks reached to A. D. 27.
   7. THE special work for the Jewish people, the confirming of
the covenant with many for one week (the last week of the sev-
enty), closed in A. D. 34. This date is marked by a general rejec-
tion of the gospel by that people, the martyrdom of Stephen, and
a'great persecution of the church by the Jews. As a result the
believers were scattered abroad, and went everywhere preaching
the gospel.. Acts 7 and 8. The next year, A. D. 35, Saul was
converted, and soon began his work as the apostle to the Gentiles.
   8. ALTHOUGH the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem
was issued in the spring of B. c. 457, the work of building the wall,
to which the seventy weeks were allotted, did not begin till the fall
of that year. This will appear when we remember that it took
several months for the people to get ready for and make such a
journey, and then prepare for the great work to be done. The
record states that they did not reach Jerusalem till the fifth month.
Ezra 7 : 8, 9. From the fact that seven weeks of the seventy were
allotted to the building of the wall, and that work did not begin
till the autumn of B. c. 457, we. conclude that the time to begin
to reckon the seventy weeks must be in the autumn, or when the
commandment was carried into effect, and not the date of the issue.
In other words, the expression, " From the going forth of the
commandment to restore and build Jerusalem," is to be understood
in harmony with the facts to which we have already alluded.
Hence the 2300 days, and all the divisions of it that contained full
years, would terminate in the fall of the year.
   The baptism of Jesus would occur in the autumn of A. D. 27,
His crucifixion in the spring of A. D. 31, and the 2300 days would
end in the autumn of 1844. This would be according to the type,
also, as the great day of atonement, the cleansing of the sanctuary, .
took place in the fall, on the tenth day of the seventh month.
This makes complete harmony in the chronology of . the 2300 days
 in all its divisions, and also in its commencement and termination.
 30                 LESSONS ON THE SANCTUARY.

 - 9. THE study of the type would lead 'us to conclude that the
 time occupied in the cleansing of the heavenly sanctuary must
 also be brief, and, therefore, must soon be finished. It is clearly
 evident from the Scriptures that the Lord never designed to reveal
 the exact time when Christ's mediation for Sinners.will cease, and
 probation will close. See Matt. 24 : 42-44; Mark 13 : 32-37.
 Hence no one should infer that the time occupied in the most holy
 Place of the heavenly temple bears the same exact ratio to the time
 spent in the holy place as it did in the earthly sanctuary. In the
 typical law and service we do not have an exact representation
 of the ministration in the heavenly sanctuary. Heb. 10 : 1.

   10. Upon what scripture was the time message based? Dan.
8 : 14.
   11. What instruction was given to Daniel concerning his proph-
icy? Dan. 12 : 4, 9.
   12. When was the time of the end reached? Dan. 11 : 33-35.
Note 4.
   13. What would we then expect to see?-The book opened and
the contents understood.
   14. What did John see on the Isle of Patmos? Rev. 10: 1, 2.
   15. How is the extent of the proclamation illustrated? Verses
2, 5.
   16. Upon what is it evidently based? -Verse 2, first clause.
   17. What is the burden of the proclamation? Verses 5, 6.
   18. In what respects did the great Advent movement of 1840 to
1844 fulfill this scripture? Verses 1-6. Note 5.
   19. What proves that the time mentioned in verse 6 does not
refer to literal or common time? Verses 7, 11. Time continues,
and there is still a work to be done for the world.
   20. How is the bitter disappointment of God's people at that
time illustrated? Verses 8-10. Note 6.
   21. To what important event does the time reach? Verse 7.
Note 7.
   22. What work is to be finished early in the sounding of that
trumpet? Verse 7. See note 7.
   23. What is the mystery of God?--The gospel. See Eph. 3:
3-6; 6 : 19; Col. 1 : 23-27.
   24. What constitutes the finishing of this mystery? Note 8.
   25. To what prophet has this been especially declared?-Daniel.
   26. Repeat the statement. Dan. 8 : 14.


                             NOTES.
  1. FROM this scripture we know that there will be a proclama-
tion to the world concerning the judgment, and this proves that
some, will know when the hour of God's judgment has come. It
therefore follows that the time of the judgment must be revealed
in the word of God, or no one would know when it begins.
32                 LESSONS ON THE sANCTDAEY.

  2. SUCH a message would not be due till the last generation is
reached, because the judgment does not come till the last days of
this world's history.
  3. IN the great Advent movement, which began to assume great
proportions in 1840, the second coming of Christ and the judg-
ment were proclaimed in all parts of the world.
   4. THE time of papal persecution is brought to view in this
scripture, and it was to reach till the time of the end. The period
began in A. D. 538, and continued for 1260 years (see Dan. 7 : 25;
Rev. 11 : 2, 3; 12 : 6, 14; 13 : 5); hence it would terminate in A. D.
1798; 1798, therefore, marks the commencement of the time of the
end. Then Daniel's prophecy would be unsealed, the book would
be opened, many would run to and fro through it, or search its
pages diligently, and thereby knowledge would be increased, and
the wise would understand. Dan. 12 : 4, 9, 10. This has been
literally fulfilled since 1798.
   5. (a) THE message was world-wide in extent. (b) It was a
time message. (c) It was based on the book of Daniel, a little
book which is now open, although formerly sealed, or closed. (d)
It was not clearly understood; something was hidden from view.
This is represented by the angel being clothed with a cloud. The
time message, preached back in 1840 to 1844, exactly fulfilled Rev.
10: 1-6, while the true Advent message since 1844 has been in
fulfillment of Rev. 14 : 6-12, for,- prior to the fall of 1844, they
preached that the judgment would come on the tenth day of the
seventh month (Jewish time), 1844 (October 22), which was then
future, but since that time we preach that " the hour of His judg-
ment is come," which they did not and could not truthfully do
prior to that date.
  6. THE bitter disappointment which Adventists suffered when
the time passed and the Saviour did not appear, is not proof that
they were not His people and were not engaged in His work, be-
cause the disappointment is clearly foretold in the scripture where
the message is found.
  7. THE time message of Rev. 10 : 1-6 reaches to the sounding of
                  LESSONS ON THE SANCTUARY.                     33

the seventh trumpet, and, as it is based on the little book which
says that " unto 2300 days then shall the sanctuary be cleansed,"
we know that that period also brings us to that event, which is
really the finishing of the mystery of God. Verse 7.
  8. THE finishing of the gospel work includes the closing work
of our High Priest in the heavenly temple, or the cleansing of the
sanctuary, and the closing message of the gospel here•on the earth,
the threefold message of Rev. 14 : 6-12. The last is the necessary
complement of the first.

   20. What did they see in the temple of God in heaven? Rev.
11 : 19.
   21. What did they know must be contained in that ark?
   22. As they by faith viewed the sacred ark with its holy law,
how were they led to regard them?—With greater interest than
ever before.
   23. What conclusion did they reach respecting the law of God?
—That it is unchangeable in its nature, and reads, and, therefore,
requires, the same now as it did when spoken on Sinai and placed
in the ark.
 . 24. In what embarrassing position did they find themselves?—
Working on the Lord's Sabbath, and keeping another day.
   25. What did this lead them to do?—To study the Sabbath
question with deep interest, in order to learn how this change was
effected. 4*
                  LESSONS ON THE SANCTUARY.

                             NOTES.
  1. OUR High Priest ministers in both apartments of the temple
in heaven. He is also said to open and shut a door in connection
with His work. Hence we are led to conclude that these acts rep-
resent the change in His position from one apartment to the other.
The close of His work in the holy place would be fitly illustrated
by His shutting the door or entrance into it, and the commence-
ment of His work in the most holy place would be forcibly repre-
sented by His opening the door into that apartment; and in so do-
ing He places before His people an open door which no man can
shut. This enables them to look by faith through. that open door
and see their great High Priest ministering before the ark in the
temple of God. Rev. 11 : 19. We know by the type that the ark
contains the holy law of God without one jot or tittle changed.

  2. THE Philadelphia church had, this open door placed before
them. Rev. 3 : 7, 8. This was the church that received the Ad-
vent message up to the autumn of 1844. They came right to the
close of the great prophetic period in 1844, and there and then
Christ placed before them an open door which reveals the ark of
the testament to those who search to know the truth.

   3. THE Advent people in 1844 thought that the earth was the
sanctuary, and that the cleansing of the sanctuary was the purifi-
cation of the earth by fire at the second coming of Christ, prepar-
atory to its becoming the home of the redeemed. Hence they be-
lieved that the 2300 days reaclitrd to the second coming of Christ
and the judgment, events which they supposed coincided in point
of time.
  4. THEIR bitter disappoit tment caused those who had a genuine
Christian experience to study the Scriptures more carefully and
prayerfully than ever before.

  5. IN reviewing their position, they found there was no mistake
in regard to the time, and therefore they began to study the other
part of the text, which says, "Then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."
Some, however, thought the trouble was in the computation of the•

time, and they endeavored to readjust the prophetic periods; and
this has led to all the time setting since 1844.
  6. THOSE who carefully studied the subject of the sanctuary with
a desire to know the truth, learned the facts that are being brought
out in these lessons.

                             NOTES.
  1. SIN is the transgression of the law (1 John 3 : 4), and he who
transgresses the law is a sinner. But when a man not only sins
himself but by his influence and power leads millions of others to
sin, how fitting that he should be called 11 the man of sin " 1 So
the Papacy, under the symbol of the little horn in Daniel 7; is
said to have "eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking
great things" (verse 8), and he thinks to change times and the law
(verse 25), and hence the Lord appropriately calls him " the man
of sin." 2 Thess. 2: 3, 4.
  2. IN view of the fact that the judgment is now in session, and
that the law of God is the rule of judgment, it surely is the duty
of those who have the light that shines from the sanctuary, to pro-
claim the great truth that " the hour of His judgment is come,"
and plead with the people to turn from all false worship and "keep
the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus," that they may
stand in the judgment and be accounted worthy of everlasting life.
This is the message which is now due, and which must be given to
the world, according to the prophecy. Rev. 14 : 6-12.
  3. MAN, in his fallen condition, is so blinded by sin that he can-
not see the holiness and perfection of the divine law. Our eyes
need to be anointed that we may see. Hence the Psalmist prays,
" Open Thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of
Thy law." Ps. 119: 18. The gospel reveals the law in all its per-
fection and beauty in the person of Jesus Christ. In Him all full-
ness dwells. Col. 2 : 9. Therefore in receiving Christ and behold-
ing Him the righteousness of the law is revealed to us and fulfilled
in us. Rom. 8 : 3, 4.
  4. BABYLON, from Babel, which signifte,s confusion, is a very
appropriate symbol of the church of to-day with its multitudinous
sects and jargon of conflicting creeds. The truth of God for these
last days would have healed Babylon (Jer. 51 : 7-9), but she rejected
                   LESSONS ON TttE SANCTUARY.

the light from heaven, and teaches fables and false doctrines, to turn
the people away frOm the truth and work of God. Thus she
makes the nations drunker., and suffers a moral fall.
  5. IN her fallen condition, having separated herself from the
Lord, her source of strength, she seeks the help of earthly powers,
and unites with them in order to secure it. Thus she commits for-
nication and fills up the cup of her iniquity. Soon the plagues
described in Rev. 18 : 8-24 will overtake Babylon, and hence it be-
hooves God's people to come out of her, and not partake of her
sins and receive of her plagues. Verse 4. The Babylon here
brought to view evidently includes the mother and the daughters
of this great family, viz., the Church of Rome and all those
churches that unite with the world and reject the Lord by refusing
to obey His word and by teaching for doctrines the commandments
of men.
