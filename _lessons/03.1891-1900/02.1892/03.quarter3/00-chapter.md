   THESE lessons are designed to be merely suggestive, to
aid the earnest student in his search for truth. It should
be understood that the lesson is in the Bible, and not in
this book. The questions and notes in this little book
are intended only as helps in the study of the lesson.
That which should be carefully studied first of all is the
scripture indicated as the subject. Get familiar with it,
and then use the suggestions in the lesson book. It will
be noticed that there are often extended notes, to which
there is in some cases no reference. The use of these
depends upon the teacher. They may be used to extend
the lesson to any length desired, or, if time does not
allow, the attention may be confined more closely to the
text. It is recommended, however, that the subjects dis-
cussed in the notes, and the scriptures cited, be carefully
studied.

         LiESSO$ I.-duly                       2, .1.892.

    THE ASCENSION OF CHRIST.—ACTS
                     (MEMORY VERSES, 81z.)
  GOLDEN TEXT.—"When he had spoken these things, while they be-
held, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight." Acts
r:o.


     I. To whom was the book of the Acts of the
Apostles addressed? Acts I: I.
     2. What previous treatise was addressed to
Theophilus? Luke I:3, 4.
    3. Then who was the writer of the book of
Acts?
    4. What does Luke say his former treatise con-
tained? Acts I: I, 2.
    5. What ground does this allow for the suppo-
sition that there were some things that Jesus com-
municated to his disciples, which are not recorded?
  NOTE.—The writer of the book of Acts says that in his
previous treatise he recorded all that Jesus began to do
and teach, up to the very day that he ascended. This
does not mean that he recorded every word and act that
Jesus said and did, for that would have been impossible.
See John 21:25. We have not every thing that Jesus said
in regard to any doctrine, but we have every doctrine
that he taught. Of course the assumption that Jesus
taught certain things that are now held, which are not
contained in the New Testament, is folly. For if a thing
is not recorded, nobody can know anything about it;
but this text expressly tells us that no truth that Jesus
gave utterance to has been omitted by the evangelists.
As Paul afterwards said of himself (Acts zo: 20), they
kept back nothing that was profitable.
               LESSONS FROM THE ACTS.

    6. How long was Jesus with his disciples after
his resurrection? Acts :3.
    7. What did he do in this time?—Ib.
    8. While they were together, what command
did he give them? Verse 4.
    9. To what promise did he refer? Verse 5.
   10. What record have we of their having had
this promise? John 14: 16, 26; 15:26.
    t. At the close of the forty days, when the dis
ciples met with Jesus, what did they ask him? Acts
t :6.
   12. To what was this question equivalent?
   NoTE.—In the beginning God created man to have
"dominion over the fish 'of the sea, and over the fowl of
the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and
over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."
Gen. 1:26-28; Ps. 8:6-8. The whole earth, therefore,
was his kingdom, but when man fell he lost his dominion,
so that, as the apostle says, " Now we see not yet all
things put under him." Heb. 2:8. This inheritance
was promised to Abraham and his seed (Rom. 4:13), and
also to David, whose throne.God said should endure for-
ever. The one through whom David's throne is to be
perpetuated is Christ (see Luke 1:31-33; Acts 2: 29, 3o),
whose possession is to be the " uttermost parts of the
earth." Ps. 2: 7,8. Because of the wickedness of David's
successors, the kingdom (that is, the whole earth) was
given to Nebuchadnezzar (Jer. 27: 2-7), and after him to
other people, no more to be controlled by David's line
until the coming of Christ, to whom it rightly belongs.
See Eze. 21: 25-27. The control of the earth by heathen
kings, and the taking of it by the Lord Jesus Christ, are
described in Dan. 2:37-44. This kingdom is received
from the Father by Christ while in heaven, for he likened

himself to a nobleman going into a far country to receive
for himself a kingdom and to return after having re-
ceived the kingdom. Luke 19: 12-15. So when he comes
the second time he comes in his kingdom. Matt. 25: 31;
2 Tim 4:1. He subdues it by destroying the wicked
from out of it (Ps. 2: 9; Matt. 13: 41, 42), and then the
righteous inherit the dominion and the greatness of the
kingdom under the whole heaven, and delight themselves
forever in the abundance of peace (Dan. 7. 27; Ps. 37:
9-11; Matt. 1343). So when the disciples asked if Christ
would at that time restore the kingdom of Israel, they
were asking if that was the time when they should be
taken to reign with him in glory. From the prophets
they knew that glory was to follow the suffering of Christ
(t Peter I: t), but how long after the suffering before the
glory would follow, even the prophets themselves did not
know. That time is in God's own power, and he has not
revealed it to any. What he says to all is, Watch.
   13. What reply did Jesus make? Acts 1: 7.
   14. What did he say they would receive when
the Holy Spirit came upon them? Verse 8.
   15. In this strength what were they to do?—Z6.
   16. When did this conversation take place?
Luke 24:49, 50.
   17. What did Jesus do when they reached Beth-
any? Verse 50.
   18. When he was blessing them, what took place?
Verse 51; Acts 1:9.
   19. While the disciples were looking toward
heaven as Jesus went up, who stood by them?
Verse xo.                                   .
   20. What did these angels say to them? Verse

  21. Since a cloud received Jesus when he ascended,
                 LESSONS FROM THE ACTS.                           7

and he is to come again as he went, how must he
come? Matt. 24:3o.
   22. Since the cloud that received Jesus, dimin-
ishing in size as it receded, was the last thing seen
by the disciples, what must be the "sign of the Son
of Man in heaven? "
   23. Did Jesus ascend secretly or openly? Acts
1:9.
   24. Then, since he is to come "in like manner"
as he ascended, how must it be when he comes?
Rev. : 7.
   25. Did the angels leave it doubtful as to who

   NOTE.—Pentecost was the fiftieth day from the day that
Jesus lay in the grave. As he was seen after his resurrec-
tion for forty days, the disciples must have been praying
together about ten days.
     6. In what way did the Spirit come? Verses
2, 3.
   NOTE.—Note that the text does notsay that there came
a wind from heaven, but that there came a sound as of a
rushing, mighty wind. Notice also that it is not stated
that fire sat upon the disciples. There was no fire, but
the appearance of fire,—cloven tongues, "like as of fire."
Since it was only like fire, it could not have been fire.
This, therefore, has no connection with the baptism of
fire spoken of by John the Baptist. Matt. 3: 11.

power for the success of the gospel eighteen hun-
dred years ago, how must it be now?
   21. When Jesus promised the Spirit, how long
did he say it should remain in the church? John
14: 16.
  NOTE. Jesus told the disciples that they should re-
ceive power after the Holy Ghost came upon them, and
that by this power they should be witnesses for him unto
the uttermost parts of the earth. The commission to
preach the gospel to every creature has not yet expired,
for the gospel is to be preached as a witness until the end
comes. Matt. 24: 14. Therefore the Spirit of power,
with its gifts, must remain until the end. In every age
wherever the gospel has gone with power, some of the
gifts of the Spirit have been manifested. This must of
necessity be more marked as the end approaches. Satan

will work " with all power and signs and lying wonders,
and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them
that perish." 2 Thess. 2: 9, ro. But he will not have the
field all to himself; for God, by his Spirit, will work with
all power and signs and wonders of truth in them that
believe. On the day of Pentecost only one gift of the
Spirit was manifested; consequently that did not ex-
haust Joel's prophecy. Others have been exhibited at
different times since, and as the end draws near all the
gifts will be manifested at once. All the believers will
not have all the gifts, but everyone may have at least the
gift of helping or ministering.

THE FIRST CHRISTIAN CHURCH.—ACTS 2 :37-47.
                   (MEMORY VERSES, 12-47.)
  GOLDEN TEXT.—" The Lord added to the church daily such as should
be saved." Acts 2:47.

   INTRODUCTION. —The title of this lesson is a misnomer.
The Christian church antedated Pentecost by many hun-
dred years. In Acts 7:37, 38 we read of the "church in
the wilderness " in connection with Moses. And in Heb.
it : 24-26 we read that when Moses cast in his lot with the
people of God, suffering affliction with them, he was
sharing the reproach of Christ. Thus it is clear that be-
lievers in the days of Moses constituted the Christian
               LESSONS ROM THE ACTS.                    11

church just as surely as in Peter's time, or to-day. It
was several years after this Pentecost before the disciples
were called Christians; but whatever is described by the
term had existed for hundreds and even thousands of
years. Ever since there have been believers in God an 1
in his power to save through Christ, there has been a
Christian church.
   i. Give a brief synopsis of Peter's sermon on
Pentecost.
   NOTE.—The student who does not study carefully and
thoughtfully Acts 2: 22-36 will lose very much of the force
of this lesson. Let us briefly summarize Peter's dis-
course. As seen in last week's lesson, the apostle cited
Joel's prophecy as an explanation of what was taking
place. Next he referred to the facts of the ministry, death,
and resurrection of Jesus. Acts 2: 22-24. These he men-
tioned as well-known events. Then in verses 25-28 he
quotes the words of David in Ps. 16:8-11. He shows
(verse 29) that this would not apply to David, because he
was dead, and his sepulcher was with them till that day.
There was no one to whom the words could apply except
to Jesus, who was raised from the grave before he saw
corruption. Therefore, Dav:d was speaking prophetically
of the resurrection of Christ. Verses 30-32. In har-
mony with the words of the Psalmist, Jesus was exalted
to the right hand of God, and it was from him that this
manifestation of the Spirit had come. Verse 33. Still
further it is shown that Christ must be the one referred
 to, because he had not ascended into the heavens, but in
 Ps. f to: f he had said, "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit
 thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy foot-
stool. Therefore the irresistible conclusion which pro-
 duced such sharp conviction was, "God hath made that
 same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and
 Christ."

       How did such power in the church affect the
people? Verse 43.
  12. How did the believers hold their property?
Verse 44.
  13. Does this indicate an equal dividing of prop-
erty among all the believers? Verse 45.
   NOTE.—"And all that believed were together, and had
all things common; and sold their possessions and goods,
and parted them to all men, as every man had need."
Several reasons might be given to show that this was
not a dividing up of the property,in the church, so that
each member has•an equal share, according to the modern
communistic idea. It is sufficient, however, to note that
believers were being added every day,. and such a plan
would have involved an inventory and a redistribution
every day, which would have been an impossibility.
They simply parted with their possessions " as every man
had need." It was the natural outgrowth of the Spirit of
Christ in the church, making all feel that they were mem-
                    LESSONS FROM THE ACTS.                       18

    bers of the same body. It was the pure unselfishness o:
    Christ. The trouble with modern " anti-poverty " socie-
    ties is that they try to do arbitrarily and by resolution that
    which can be accomplished purely by the Spirit of God.
    They try to produce results without the cause. The re-
    sults at which they aim are often good, but they cannot
    be produced in unregenerate, selfish hearts, and no pledge
    or compact can take selfishness out of the heart. •
       14. What description is given of the daily con-
    duct of the believers. Verse 46.
       NOTE.—Many questions will doubtless be asked in re-
    gard to the breaking of bread,—was it the Lord's Supper?
    or was it only a common meal? Such questions are use-
    less. All we have is the simple statement that they broke
    bread from house to house. A child who is old enough
    to read can tell as much about it as a Doctor of Divinity
    can; he can reply in the words of Scripture. Innumer-
     able evils have arisen and still arise from ouessing at the
    meaning of texts of Scripture, and e           ;• an arbitrary
    opinion.

that comes from the same faith? Rom. 3:21, last
part.
  zo. How does this righteousness compare with
that which a man gets by his own efforts? Phil. 3:

  NOTE.—In this lesson we have a notable example of
the working of faith. Similar ones may be found in Matt.
9: 2-8; 15:21-28; Luke 8:43-48; 18:35-43. Note the state-
ment concerning these cases, that it was faith that healed
them. In each case it was utterly impossible for the
afflicted one to do anything for his own recovery. The
only way they could even show their good will to be
better was to submit to the power that could make them
better. The same faith that restored these afflicted ones
to health will make men righteous; and nothing else will.
What the Lord requires of us is to walk humbly with
God. Micah 6:8. But we are " without strength " (Rom.
5: 8) and cannot walk. So God in his mercy lifts us up
out of the pit, and sets our feet upon the Rock, and
establishes our goings. Ps. 40:1-3. He makes us to
walk in the way of his commandments; and the right-
eous acts done by faith are as real as were the steps taken
by the man in the temple.

     6. When the apostles were brought before the
council the next day, what question was asked
them? Verses 5-7.
     7. Whom did Peter have to conduct his case
before the council? Verse 8.
   NOTE.—It is worth while to note carefully the " de-
fense which the apostle made when brought before the
council. In this, as in each succeeding instance, they
simply preached the gospel. They did not act at all as
if they were on trial, or as though their lives were in the
least danger. One cannot detect the slightest difference
between Peter's preaching before the council and his
preaching on Pentecost. They had no thought of their
own safety. Self did not appear at all. Whenever they
were arraigned, they recognized that as an opportunity
to preach the gospel to men who would probably never
hear it in any other way. There are sincere, candid men
in every walk of life. Even in courts where bitter preju-
dice seems to exist against the truth, there are misguided
men who are susceptible to its influence when it is brought
before them. But their business absorbs all their time;
and from what they have heard about the gospel, they
do not think it worth while to go where it is regularly
preached. Hence it must be carried tp them. Therefore
whenever any of God's people are brought into court be-
cause of the truth, they should remember that that is
               LBSSONS FROM THE ACTS.                  17

God's means of bringing the truth before those men.
God has graciously allowed them to be the agency
through whom his truth is to be presented to men who
would not otherwise be reached.
   But only God, who knows the hearts of men, can tell
what will reach those men. Therefore he must be al-
lowed to speak in his own way, through his own instru-
ment. He wants to speak through the one whom he has
allowed to be brought into court. For that person to
secure somebody else to speak for him, is to work di
rectly against God. If he hires another to plead his case,
he shows that he does not appreciate the situation. It
is not he that is called in question, but God's truth; and
it is the truth, and not himself, that is to be defended.
And God by his Spirit is to conduct the defense. No
matter how humble a man may be, if he is brought into
court for the truth's sake, God wants him to bear a testi-
mony there, and he will speak through him. He who
created the heavens and the earth is as able to speak
through a laboring man as through a scholar, provided
that man is acquainted with him. If the man is there
solely on the Lord's account, the Lord should be allowed
to conduct the case.

    8. How much time is it to be supposed that
Peter spent preparing the line of argument that he
would pursue? Matt. Io:19, 20; Luke 21:12-15.

  16. How do all men by nature compare with the
impotent man, in their ability to keep the command-
ments? Rom. 5: 6, 8; 7:8; Gal. 5: 17.
  17. What alone will work righteousness in us?
Acts 4: ro—r 2; Eph. 2: IO.
  NOTE.-" By grace are ye saved through faith." Eph.
2:8. Salvation is from sin, and sin is the transgression
of the law. If a person is saved from transgressing the
law, it necessarily follows that he is made to keep the
law. Therefore salvation by faith means righteous acts
performed by faith. This is indicated by what follows
the verse first quoted in this paragraph. "For we are
his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good
works." Eph. 2: io. The power of faith to work right-
eousness, and the reality of that righteousness, are shown
by the miracles of healing wrought by faith.

duce actual righteousness, if we have faith in it?

20             LESSONS FROM THE ACTS.

men who preach the gospel with the most power are
those who have felt in themselves the creative power of
God, making them new creatures. Consequently, they
trust that power to carry on the work, and to deliver and
protect them from the rage of the enemy. So the disci-
ples put their trust in the God who can create. • The Sab-
bath is the memorial of God's creative and sanctifying
power. Ex. 20: 8-11; Eze. 20: 12. Therefore those who
are carrying the gospel, with that which is the badge of
its power, ought most of all men on earth to trust the
Lord. He who puts his trust in man, instead of God,
has but a poor knowledge of what the Sabbath is.

boldness in declaring the truth?
  NOTE.—The disciples had no thought of working any
the less because they were threatened. They were in
the Lord's hands, and upon him rested the responsibility
of caring for them. But they would not even trust them-
selves not to be afraid; so they committed themselves to
God, that he who made the earth might by the same
power keep them from being moved by fear.

      NOTE.—"And with great power gave the apostles

    grace was upon them all." It is worth while to note
    that this was when the multitude of believers were of one
    heart and of one soul, and no one called anything that he
    had his own, but held it ready to bestow where there
    was need. In short, there was perfect unselfishness,
    and only the Spirit of Christ ruled.

same time they secretly kept a good sum to use as they
pleased.. They had a right to keep it all if they wished.
There was no compulsion. They were not punished for
keeping back the money, but for hypocrisy,—for lying to
God. The Holy Ghost, to whom they lied, exposed
them.
   9. To whom had he been guilty of lying?
Verses 3, 4.
  IO. What happened to Ananias when he heard
these words? Verses 5, 6.
  I I. When his wife came in, what conversation
took place? Verses 7-9.
  12. What also happened to her? Verse 10.
  13. What was the result of this affair? Verse it.
  14. What further exhibition of God's power was
manifest through the apostles? Verse 12.
  15. Who were added to the church? Verse 14.
  16. What about the others? Verse 13.
  17. How is it, then, that Christ's church is to be

    kept free from those who would bring a reproach
    upon it? Isa. 5 :7, first part; 27: 2, 3.
      18. Why is it that we do not see it so kept now?
       NOTE.—When Christ is followed as the only leader,
    and he is allowed to control the church by his own word,
    he will keep it clear of hypocrites. There is a great
    temptation, when the church is in the condition that the
0   early church was, for designing men to seek to come into
    it for their own pecuniary advantage. Sometimes this is
    used as an argument against doing the same now that
    the early church did. But see how Christ protected his
    church then, and by the prompt judgment upon the hyp-
    ocrites caused others to feaeto join. Yet believers were
    added every day.



    LESSON           ItI11.—August 20, 1892.

    THE APOSTLES PERSECUTED.—ACTS 5: 17-41.
                     (MEMORY VERSES, 29-32.)
     GOLDEN TEXT.—"We ought to obey God rather than men." Acts 5: 29.

        I. When the high priest and his associates saw
    the wonderful progress of the gospel, how did they
4   feel and do? Acts 5: 17, 18.
      NOTE.—The first time the apostles were seized, the
    rulers were "grieved." This time they were "filled with
    indignation." The apostles had been guilty of contempt
    of court They had deliberately disobeyed the orders of
    the council. The council no doubt thought that they
    were dealing very mildly with the disciples. They had
    not done anything to them the first time, but had threat-
    ened them, giving them fair warning for the future. In

the apostles' persistent preaching they could see nothing
but obstinacy, especially as the apostles had plainly said
that they would not obey.
   2. How did the Lord show that he did not want
them in prison? Verses 19, zo.
  NOTE.—The Lord is the best deliverer and defender.
When he has work elsewhere for his servants, he will not
allow them to lie in prison. The council wanted the
apostles in prison; the Lord wanted them to preach in
the temple; so they left the prison as easily as they would
have left their own houses. When Paul was in prison at
Philippi, the Lord opened it by an earthquake, and let
him out. But he left him in prison at Csarea two whole
years, because he wanted him to preach the gospel to
Nero at Rome, and the only way that Paul could reach
him was as a prisoner.
    3. What took place in the morning when the
council assembled? Verses 21-23.
    4. When the council learned where the apostles
were, what did they do? Verses 25-27.
    5. What question did they ask them? Verse 28.
    6. What reply did the apostles make? Verse
29.
    7. What had they already told the council?
Acts 4:19, 20.
    8. Whom did they at once begin to preach?
Acts 5:30.
    9. What did they say that God had done for
Jesus? Verse 31.
  io. What does God through Christ give to men?

   I. Was it only to the Jews that God gave repent-
ance? Acts

         12. In whom anc all the blessings of God con-
      tained? Eph. r : 3.
         13. To how many is Christ given? John 6:51;
      Heb. 2:9.
         14. Then to how many have God's blessings
      been given?
         15. For what purpose does God give his blessing
a     to men? Acts 3:26.
         16. Then how is it that all men are not saved?
      John 5:4o; 1:11, 12.
         17. Who did the apostles say were witnesses to
      the truth they spoke? Acts 5:32.
         IS. What must a witness always tell?
        Nogg. —"And we are his witnesses of these things; and
      so is also the Holy Ghost." A witness must tell only
      what he knows. No one can know Christ except by his
      Spirit; therefore no one can be a witness for Christ who
    . has not made his acquaintance through the Spirit.
       19. Then what must also always bear witness
     whenever men really witnesg to the truth? I Peter
     t:It; John 15:26.
        20. What effect
                    ;or did the apostles' preaching have
     on the council? Acts 5:33.
        21. By whom was their murderous purpose
     checked? Verse 34.
        22. By what argument did he restrain the wrath
     of the council? Verses 35-39.
        NoTE.—From this lesson it appears that it is some-
     times allowable for a lawyer to plead in behalf of one
     who is accused on account of the gospel. But God must
     choose the man. When God moves a lawyer to interest
     himself in a case, his plea will amount to something. It
26                 LESSONS FROM THE ACTS.

is very likely that if the apostles had been going to se-
cure the services of a lawyer, they would not have chosen
Gamaliel. And if they had, his words would not have
had half the weight that they did coming voluntarily and
without the knowledge of the apostles. The fact that so
learned and conservative a man as Gamaliel would of his
own accord intimate the possibility that to persecute those
men might be to fight against. God, would set some to
thinking over the matter.
  23. Although the men of the council agreed to
Gamaliel's advice, what did their anger lead them
to do? Verse 4o.
   24. How did the apostles receive this? Verse 41.

Acts 6:8-1o.
    3. When he was brought before the council on
a false charge, what did he do?
    4. What plainly appeared from his rehearsal of
the history of Israel?     •
   NOTE.:—The whole of Stephen's discourse was calcu-
lated to fix the minds of his hearers directly upon Christ.
There were also direct references to Christ as in the proph-
                    LESSONS FROM THE ACTS.                   27_

     ecy of Moses: "A prophet shall the Lord your God raise
     up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye
     hear." He was not pleading for his life, but was preach-
AP   ing the gospel. Indeed, at the close of his discourse the
     Holy Spirit made him an accuser, plainly showing that
     his judges were the guilty ones.
         5. With what charge did he suddenly terminate
     his discourse? Acts 7: 51-53.
         6. Who was it that was thus accusing the
     judges? Matt. to: 19, 20; Acts 7: 55.
          7. How did Stephen's words affect the mem-
     bers of the council? Acts 7: 54.
         8. Where was Stephen's gaze directed? Verse
     55.
         9. What did he see? Verses 55, 56.
        10. What did the angry mob then do? Verses
     57, 58.
             What did Stephen do ivhile he was being
     stoned? Verse 59.
        12. What spirit did he exhibit toward his mur-
     derers? Verse 6o.
        NOTE.—While the mob was clamoring for Stephen's
     life, he was calmly gazing into heaven, entirely lost to all
     his surroundings. Only for a moment did he seem to
     take notice of what was going on, and that was to pray
     for his persecutors. But most wonderfully expressive of
     perfect indifference to all that was going on around him,
     and of a soul resting in perfect peace, is the sentence
     which describes his death,—" He fell asleep." The mob
     was howling with rage; a jargon of sounds appalling to
     the ordinary ear must have issued from it. Added to this
     was the pelting of the stones upon Stephen's body. But
     amid all this noise and tumult, Stephen calmly fell asleep.
      Happy is the man who is so completely lifted out of and
     above self.

   18. What led him to do this? Acts 26: 9.
   19. Did this persecution succeed in suppressing
the gospel? Acts 8: I, 4.
   NoTE.—Satan thought to put out the fire that had be-
gun to burn so brightly in Jerusalem. The result was
that he kindled thousands of others. He scattered the
firebrands everywhere.. Thus persecution worked out
God's plan. If the disciples had stayed in Jerusalem,
they would have stagnated. There would not have been
enough scope for their activity to keep their piety alive.
The church is the salt of the earth, and salt is of no use
unless it comes in contact with that which needs preserv-
ing.

      NOTE.—We must not understand that none of the Sa-
    maritans had been converted until Peter and John came
    down, although they had not received the gifts of the
    Holy Ghost. That was to fit them for work. When
    Simon saw what the apostles did, he wanted to learn how
    to impart the same power to others. He saw that if he
    only had the ability to do what Peter and John did, he
    could make it exceedingly profitable to himself. But

that showed that he did not know the first principles of
the gospel. The apostles never received the power until
they were completely emptied of self; but he was wholly
filled with self. The grace of Christ is to give riches to
others, and not to seek it for self. 2 Cor. 8: 9. Christ

work of the gospel in the early part of the first century
was under the direction of the Holy Spirit. It will be a
good point to keep in mind in succeeding lessons. Philip
was not left to go here or there as chance might dictate,               1
but was directed by the Spirit, When he went toward
Gaza, he knew that there was work for him there to do.
When he got there, the Spirit told him just what to do.

 Under such guidance there is no room for doubts or re-
 grets. Is it now past that time for the Lord to thus direct
 his ministers in.their work? Did the Lord set his servants

    NOTE.-" Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at
  the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus." That
 scripture was the 53d chapter of Isaiah. There is a won-
  derful amount of gospel in that chapter. It describes
  man's lost condition,and Christ's humiliation and suffering
- because of it. "All we like sheep have gone astray, we
  have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord
  hath laid on him the iniquity of us all." " He was
  wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our
  iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him;
  and with his stripes we are healed." It also describes his
  glorious triumph, when, having received those whom he
  has purchased with his own blood, Jesus sees the travail
  of his soul, and is satisfied.
    He preached Jesus unto him. This was just what Philip
32              LESSONS FROM THE ACTS.

preached to the Samaritans. Later, Paul determined to
know only Christ and him crucified. (z Cor. 2:2,, and
would not glory in anything save the cross (Gal. 6: 14).
Ought anything different to be preached in these days?
We have no warrant for it in the Bible. The apostle says
that Christ is "the fullness of Him that filleth all in all ."
Eph. 1:23. Surely it would be difficult to get anything
real outside of that fullness..
  12. What question did the eunuch ask as they
went on? Verse 36.
  13. From this question'what do we learn is nec-
essarily included in the preaching of Jesus?
  14. What is the significance of baptism? Acts
2:38; Rom. 6:3-5; Col. 2:11-13; Gal. 3:27.
   NOTE.—After Philip had preached Jesus awhile, the
eunuch said, "See, here is water, what cloth hinder me to
be baptized?" So we see that the preaching of Jesus
necessarily includes baptism. Philip said: "If thou be-
-lievest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he an-
swered and said, I believe that Jesus is the Son of God."
And upon this declaration Philip baptized him. Well,
what is enough to save a man is surely enough to allow
of his being baptized, and the apostle Paul says, " If thou
shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt
believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the
dead, thou shalt be saved." Rom. To: 9.
  15. What did Philip say to the eunuch's request                r.
to be baptiied? Acts 8:37.
  16. What profession of faith did the eunuch make?
—lb.
  17. Is simple faith in Christ sufficient for admis-
sion by baptism into the church of Christ? Acts

                  LESSONS FROM THE ACTS.                          33


   NOTE.—Let us see what it is to believe in Jesus. In
the first place, how do we know anything about him,
what and wit) he is?—Only as we read in the Bible.
Therefore to believe in Jesus Means to believe all that
the Bible tells about him. It takes all that the Bible says
of him to describe him, so that we may know who he is.
So if there is anything that the Bible says of him that we
do not accept, we do not believe in Jesus. We must be-
lieve that he came to save sinners. i Tim. 1: 15. We
must believe that he has the power to do this. Matt. 28:
 i8; Rom. 1:4; Heb. 7:25. He gave himself for the world.
John 3:16; 6: 5i; Heb. 2 : 9. Therefore, he who believes
in Christ must necessarily believe that without him every
man is a sinner without life or hope of life. But he who
believes this must acknowledge that he himself is a lost
sinner. Now if a man acknowledges that he is a sinner,
lie will accept Christ as his Saviour, if he believes that
Christ is the Saviour of sinners. The sinner who does
not accept. Christ as his Saviour from sin, does not be-
lieve in him. Therefore it follows, as the Scripture says,
that whosoever believes in Jesus must be saved. There-
fore the preaching of Jesus must embrace the preaching
of every doctrine that the Bible sets forth as necessary
for salvation. Christ is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.
John 14: 6.
    19. In order for Philip to baptize the eunuch,
what was it necessary for both to do? Acts 8: 38.
  2o. What took place when they were both come

LESSON XIL—September 17,1892.
     STEPHEN'S DISCOURSE.—ACTS 7:2-5o.
  GOLDEN TEXT.—"Now of the things which we have spoken this is the
sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the
throne of the Majesty in the heavens," Heb. 8:z.

as the lesson for this week; but as Stephen's discourse
before the Sanhedrim was entirely omitted in the regular
course, it has been thought best to insert a lesson on that
subject at this time.)
    i. Where was Abraham when God first ap-
peared to him? Acts 7: 2.
    2. What did God at that time say to him?
Verse 3. Compare Gen 12:1-3.
    3. To what place did Abraham finally come?
Acts 7:4.
    4. How much of the land of Canaan did Abra-
ham possess? Verse 5, first part.
    5. Yet how much had God promised? Verse 5,
last part.
    6. By what had that promise been confirmed?
Heb. 6:13, 17.
    7. Was it possible that God could lie in this
matter of the inheritance? Verse 18.
    8. Then what conclusion must be drawn from
Stephen's statement in Acts 7:5?
  NOTE. —Stephen's statement in Acts 7:5 most conclu-
sively proves the resurrection. God promised Abraham
an inheritance, yet Abraham died without having received
a foot of it. But God cannot lie, therefore his promise
will be fulfilled, and that means a resurrection for Abra-
ham, and not only for Abraham, but also for all his
seed.
    9. What, then, did he thus early in his discourse
bring vividly before his hearers?
  NOTE. —In Heb.    13 we are told of Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob that they "all died in faith, not having received
the promises." This shows that they did not expect their
inheritance in the land of Canaan in this life. This is
               LESSONS FROM THE ACTS.                   35


further shown by the fact that in their lifetime they con-
fessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
They looked for "an heavenly" country. Heb. 16.
Moreover, at the very time God made the covenant with
Abraham, confirming the promise, he plainly told him
that he should die without receiving the inheritance, and
that his seed should be in bondage for four hundred
years. Gen. 15: 13-16.
   10. What did God say to Abraham concerning
his seed? Acts 7 :6, 7.
   It. What did he give to Abraham? Verse 8.
   12. What was its significance? Rom. 4: II .
Compare Gen. 17:7, 8, t 1.
   NOTE.-A few other points about Abraham's inherit-
ance might be noted. The promise included the whole
earth. Rom 4:13. It is an everlasting inheritance. Gen:
17:8. Consequently, when Abraham and his seed possess
it, they will have everlasting life. The righteous only can
possess the inheritance. Rom. 4:13. This is also shown
by the fact that circumcision—the sign of righteousness
(Rom. 4:11)—was the token of the covenant. Gen. 17:11.
Still further, when God first made the promise to Abra
ham, as well as afterwards (Gen. 12:3; 22: 18), he said
that in his seed all nations of the earth should be blessed.
But in Gal. 3:8 we learn that when God said that, he was
preaching the gospel. Therefore the inheritance promised
to Abraham and his seed was such as could be obtained
only through the gospel, which is the power of God unto
salvation through the cross of Christ. Rom. I: 16; 1 Cor.
I:17, 18.
  13. What, therefore, was in this also forcibly
brought to the attention of the council?
   14. What history did Stephen then briefly out-
line? Acts 7:9-36.
36             LESSONS FROM THE ACTS.

   r5. In identifying Moses, to what did he again
direct their minds? Verse 37.
  16. To what conduct of the Israelites did Stephen
next refer? Verses 39-43.
   NOTE. —" But when the time of the promise drew nigh,
which God had sworn to Abraham," etc. When God
delivered Israel from Egypt, it was to fulfill the promise
to Abraham. But that, as we have seen, meant everlast-.
ing life in the new earth. That this was what God had in
view is corroborated by the fact that the Israelites could
not enter Canaan until they were sinless. After they
crossed the Jordan, they were all circumcised—the sign
of righteousness by faith—and the Lord said, " This day
have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you."
Josh. 5:9. Jericho was taken by faith. Heb. 11:30.
But Ai could not be taken because there was sin in the
camp, showing that when Jericho was taken all the peo-
ple had the righteousness of faith. This fact was in itself
sufficient to show the Jews the nature of the inheritance
that God gave to Israel, and who should possess it. Al-
though God gave the children of Israel the inheritance,
they departed from the faith, and so did not go on to pos-
sess the land. Read Psalm Sr. Of this apostasy Stephen
speaks in Acts 7: 39-43.
17. What is contrasted with the tabernacle of
Moloch? Acts 7: 44.
18. Why is it called the tabernacle of witness?
  NOTE. —Reference to the tabernacle of Moloch naturally
led to the mention of the " tabernacle of witness," which
the fathers brought into the land with Joshua, and which
afterwards gave place to the temple of Solomon. It was
doubtless called the "tabernacle of witness " because its
chief use was to contain the ark, in which was the law of
God, which was a "testimony " and a " witness " against

       the children of Israel. Ex. 25:21; Deut. 31: 26. But
       neither the tabernacle nor the temple of Solomon could
       be a dwelling-place for God. Solomon himself, in his
411,   prayer at the dedication of the temple, recognized the
       fact that his temple could not contain God. 2 Chron. 6:
       18. The fact that God made all things is sufficient to
       show that no man can make a house that will be a fit
       dwelling-place for him. Acts 7: 48, 49; Isa. 66: I, 2. This
       necessarily led to the conclusion that he dwells ina tern-
"      ple made without hands; and that was so suggestive of
       the conclusion that Jesus is tlie high priest in that heavenly
       sanctuary (Heb. 8: I) that the council could stand no more.
          19. What did Stephen say of its history? Acts
       7: 45-47.                        •
          20. What did he say about God's dwelling-place?
       Verses 48, 49; Isa. 66:1, 2.

         LESSON XI11.—Sept. 24, 1892.
       THE LORD'S SUPPER PROFANED.—I COR. :
                                        20-34.
         GOLDEN   TEXT.—"And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said,
       Take, eat; this is my body, which is broken for you; this do in remembrance
4      of me." x Cor. z: 24.

           I. What existed in the Corinthian church?
       I COY. I I : 19.
           2. As a consequence, were their meetings profit-
p      able or otherwise? Verse 17.
           3. What was it impossible for them to do while
       in such confusion? Verse zo, Revised Version.

    4. What unseemly actions were indulged in at
their professed celebration of the Lord's Supper?
Verse 21.
    5. Where should bodily hunger be satisfied?
Verse 22.
    6. Where had the apostles received that which
he delivered to the Corinthians? Verse 23.
    7. When Jesus, on the night of his betrayal,
took bread, what did he say and do? Verses 23,
24.
    8. What did he next do? Verse 25.
    9. What does the apostle say of this cup and
this bread? " I eor. to: 16.
   NOTE.—The Lord's Supper is called the "communion,"
since Paul declares that it is the communion of the body
of Christ. That is, it is the symbol of our oneness with
him. Eat and drink Christ by his word (John 6:63), and
this is to be done constantly. So the Lord's Supper is
only the occasional symbol of a continual feast.
  10. Then what must all those be who truly eat
the Lord's Supper? I Cor. to: 17.
   1. In that case can there be any division? I Cor.
12:25-27.
   12. What is signified by the Lord's Supper?
Cor. I I : 26.
   13. What did Jesus say of those who do not eat
his flesh and drink his blood? John 6:53.
  14.. In thus acknowledging Christ's death, what
else do we also acknowledge? Verse 53; Gal. 2: zo.
   15. Why should a man examine himself before
eating the Lord's Supper? 1 Cor. II:27, 28.

  16. How does one eat and drink unworthily?
Verse 29.
  NOTE.—" He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eat-
eth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning
the Lord's body." Strangely enough, many take this to
mean that no man who is not worthy can eat the Lord's
Supper. In that case no one could eat it. To eat the
Lord's Supper is to feed upon the body of Christ. The
eater must discern the Lord's body. Now Christ's body
was given for sinners. Rom. 5: 6. Christ alone is worthy.
The man who comes to the Lord's Supper thinking that
he himself is worthy is the one who eats and drinks un-
worthily, for he does not discern that the Lord's body
was a sacrifice for sinners. That man eats and drinks
worthily who comes acknowledging that he is nothing,
and is not worthy of anything, but that Christ is every-
thing, and that Christ is his.

  17. Then in what respect should a man examine
himself? 2 Cor. 13 :5.

   NOTE.--" Let a man examine himself, and so let him
eat." This, as indicated above, cannot mean that a man
is to take an inventory of his deeds, good and bad, so as
to know how worthy he is to eat the Lord's Supper. The
Lord does not want men to come as Pharisees. Neither
has he abdicated the throne of judgment in favor of any
man. He has not constituted a man the judge of his own
actions any more than he has made him the judge of other
men's actions. For what, then, shall a man examine
himself? Paul says, "Examine yourselves, whether ye
be in the faith." 2 Cor. 13:5. Let a man believe that
 Christ is the Saviour of sinners,—and he does not unless
 he believes that he is his Saviour,—and he will eat and
 drink worthily.
