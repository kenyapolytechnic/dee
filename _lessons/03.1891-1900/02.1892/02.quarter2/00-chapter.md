hessons FROM THE Old Testament.
                 FOR SENIOR CLASSES.



           April 2 to June 25, 1892.


        LESSON              I.—April 2, 1892.
  THE WAY OF THE RIGHTEOUS.—PS. t:1-6.
                     (MEMORY VERSES,            1-6.)
  GOLDEN TEXT.-" Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel or
the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of
the scornful." Ps. x : a.



    i. With what does the book of Psalms open?
Ps. 1: 1, first word.
  NOTE.—The first psalm has no title in the original, as
have most of the others. It was, doubtless, written by
David. It opens, as does also the book, of, course, with
a benediction. The word translated " blessed " is in the
plural, denoting "blessednesses," and, according to some
scholars, could well be translated, " Oh, the blessed-
nesses [or happinesses] of the man! " etc., including all
blessings of God's grace. It is well to notice that this
blessing is based solely on character.
4              OLD TESTAMENT LDSSONS.

   2. Upon whom is such blessing pronounced?
Verse i.
   3. What- is the first step generally taken in
wickedness? Verse i, first clause.
  NOTE.—Walking, in "the counsel of the ungodly,"
imitating their ways, seeking their advice and help, are
generally the first steps in backsliding from God. But
the man who is blessed of God does not " walk " in the
counsel of the ungodly; his counsel comes from God.
See 2 Tim. 2: 22.
   4. What would naturally follow to him who
walked in the counsel of the ungodly? Ps. 1:1,
second clause.
  No'rE.—From heeding the counsel of the ungodly,
from occasionally following their advice, a person comes
at last to stand in the way of sinners. He deliberately
chooses the "trodden path" of those who transgress
God's law.
    5. What would be the third stage of sin? Verse
i, third clause.
   Nom.—The man who departs from God at first walks
in the counsel of the ungodly, those who know not God,
till he deliberately chooses to stand, or, as given by some,
"to tread" in the way (the "trodden path") of sinners,
till at last the heart becomes hardened, and he takes his
seat among those who openly deride and scoff at that
which is good and pure and true; he chooses the assem-
bly of mockers as his companions.
    6. What leads to this hardness of heart? Heb.
,3:13.
    7. With whom alone does the counsel of life
 rest? Isa.     2.
             OLD TESTAMENT LESSONS.                 5

    8. What is the character of the counsels of God?
Isa. 25: 1; 28:29.
    9. What will be the end Of those who despise
the counsel of God? Prov. I.:29-32. •
   io. What does the Psalmist say of the ungodly?
Ps. 1: 4.
    1. What are we assured of those who put their
dependence in such? Jer. 17:5, 6.
   12. What is said of their final end      Ps. I : 5,
last clause of verse 6.
   13. Who only will stand in the judgment? Ps.
24:3, 4. Only those who have formed a right
character.
   14. Through whom alone is such a character
attained? I Cor. 1:3o; John 5:24.
   15. What change takes place in the heart of a
man thus blessed? Eze. 36:26.
   16. How will he regard God's law? Verse 27;
Ps. 1: 2.
   17. To what is the Christian growth of such a
man likened? Verse 3; Jer. 17:7, 8.
   is.. What promise does God give to those who
have sinned against him if they will but put away
their sins and seek him with the whole heart? Isa.
58:8, 11.
   19. What does he say of his prosperity? Ps. 1:
3, last clause.
   20. Can even the persecutions to which the peo-
 ple of God have been always subject be said to be
 prosperity or for their good? Rom. 8:35-37, 28.

        LESSON 11.-11prril 9, 1892.

             THE KING IN ZION.—PS.                   2:1-12.
                  (MEMORY VERSES, ro-ta.)
    GOLDEN TEXT.—" Blessed are all they that put their trust in Hint." Ps.
2:12.


   NOTE.—The psalm under consideration is divided
into four parts, as follows: r. A prediction of the efforts
of the rulers of the world against Christ when he was
manifested as the Anointed of God, and, hence, against
God, who sent him, and the result of their efforts. 2.
The address of the Father to the nations. 3. The ad-
dress of the Son. 4. An appeal of love and warning to
the people.
                         THE PREDICTION.

    I. What is said of the nations at the first ad-
vent of Christ? Ps, 2: t.
    2. What did they do against Christ? Verses
2, 3.
  NOTE.—" Messiah, " in Hebrew, and "Christ," in Greek,
mean "anointed." See John 1: 41, margin.           The
Anointed of Jehovah is Christ the Lord. That anoint-
ing took place when he was manifested to the world as
the Messiah. It was effected at his baptism, when the
Holy Spirit, like a dove, rested upon him. Luke 4:18;
Acts to:38.
   3. What would their counsel against God prove
to be? Ps. 2 1, last clause.
   4. What did their counsel really result in?
Acts 4:25-28; Rev. 12: IQ.
               OLD TESTAMENT LESSONS                  7

    5. Of what great truth is this a confirmation?

will he do? Verse 5.

be executed? 2 Thess. :7-9.
   9. What has God done for that Son whom his
people thought to destroy? Ps. 2:6.
  1o. Where is this hill of Zion? Heb. 12:22.
    T. What position does Christ occupy there?
Heb. 8 : 1; Zech. 6:13.
            THE ADDRESS OF THE SON.
    12. What does Christ say he will declare? Ps. 2:
•7, first part.
    13. What is this decree of God? Verse 7, last
 part.
    14. To what time does this refer? Acts 13:33;
 Heb. 5:5.
    15. What did the resurrection show Jesus to be?
 Rom. I :3. 4.
    16. What assurance does God give him? Ps.
2:8.
    17. What promise and oath of God will then be
 fulfilled? Gen. 22: 16-18.
    18. At what time will this be fulfilled? 1 Cor.
15: 24-28.
   NOTE.—That the student may not be misled, we give
 the following paraphrase of r Cor. 15: 24-28: "Then com-
              OLD TESTAMENT LESSONS.

eth the end [of Christ's reign on his Father's throne as
priest, Zech. 6: 12, 13; Rev. 3:21], when he [the Son]
shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the
Father ; when he [the Father] shall have put down all
rule and all authority and power. For he [the Son]
must reign [as priest], till he [the Father] hath put all
enemies under his [the Son's] feet [as the Father prom-
ised in Ps. I to: t]. The last enemy that shall be de-
stroyed is death. For he [the Father] hath [in purpose,
Rom. 4:17, last part] put all things under his [the
Son's] feet. But when he [the Father] saith all things•
are put under him [the Son], it is manifest that he [the
Father] is excepted, that did put all things under him [the
Son]. And when all things shall be subdued unto him
[the Son], then shall the Son also himself be subject unto
him [the Father] that put all things under him [the Son],
that God may be all in all." Then Christ takes his own
throne. Matt. 25: 31; Rev. 3: 21.
   19. What will he do to those nations who at that
time know him not? Ps. 2:9; Matt. 13 : 39-42.
                THE LOVING APPEAL.
   2o. Before that great day of wrath comes, what
appeal does God in mercy make through the gos-
pel? Ps. 2: to, it.
   21. Instead of meditating evil against the Son,
what does he entreat them to do? Verse 12.
  NOTE. —The word translated " kiss" is evidently used
in the sense of receiving, embracing, accepting. Some
ancient authorities render, "Lay hold of (or receive) in-
struction," others, "Worship in purity." See margin of
Revised Version.
   22. In what time alone have we assurance? 2
Cor. 6:2; Heb. 3:13.
   23. What gracious assurance does God give to
all? John 6:37; golden text.

   NOTE. --In this psalm are described two great manifes-
tations of God, namely, his works and his word.
                   GOD IN HIS WORKS.

festations of God? Ps. 19: I.,

work thus manifested? Verse 2.
    3. How far-reaching is this instruction?, Verses
3, 4; Rom. io:18.
    4. What responsibility does this revelation place
upon man? Rom. 1:19, '20.
  NOTE.—It has been well said that the manifestation of
God in the works of nature is his great primary school, day ,
school and night school, and universal primary day and
night school.
    5. How may it be said that man is left without
excuse by the revelation which God makes of him-
self in his works?
   NOTE.—God's works—the glory and beauty of the
heavens and the earth-I-proclaim a Being of infinite
power, knowledge, wisdom, and glory. But a Being who
is infinite in power and wisdom and knowledge must be
infinite also in justice and mercy (or love, the combination
of all goodness) so that a reflective soul desiring to know
more of God would be led "from nature up to nature's
God."

   6. How does the Psalmist describe the most
glorious of God's work manifest to us? Ps. 19:
4-6.
    7. Of what is the sun the great source to us?
Ans.—Of light and heat, a symbol of the light and
life from God, warming, blessing all.
           GOD IN HIS WORD OR LAW.
    8. What must reflect the character of a govern-
ment? Ans.—The law, for it is the kind of laws
and their enforcement 'which make a government
what it is.
    9. What is said of the law of the Lord? Ps. 19 :
7, first clause.
   1o. Can that which is perfect be amended?
    1. What is the effect of the law on the soul?
Verse 7, first part.
  NOTE.—The law restores the soul by revealing the right
way, pointing out its sin (t John 3:4; .Rom. 7:7) and need
of a Saviour, and so leads to conversion. See Gal. 3:
22, 23.
  12. What is a second characteristic of God's law?
Ps. 19: 7, last part.
  NOTE.—" Testimony" means witness. God's law is
the witness of his character, and also witnesses to the
righteousness of Christ in us. Rom. 3: 21. This (as well
as all other kindred terms used in this connection) refers
to the Decalogue. See Ex. 25: 16.
  13. What effect does the witness of God have
upon the simple? Ps. 19:'7, last part; 119:98-10o.
  NOTE. —This witness is "sure;" it will never fail; it
can be depended upon forever. "Amen " is derived from
              OLD TI.I.ST.4,11ENT L ES S 0                  1

the same word. It makes wise the simple, not the fool-
ish, but the ignorant who desire to know.
  14. What third characteristic and result of God's
law is mentioned? Ps. 191 8, first part; 119:111,
128.
   NOTE.—" Statutes " (Revised Version "precepts"), ap-
pointments, charges, which God has given. They are
right and right alone, and hence the converted heart re-
joices that it has found the right way.
   15. What is the fourth characteristic of God's
law? and what is its effect? Ps. 19:8, last part;
12:6.
   16. What is the fifth characteristic of that law
and its effect? Ps. 19 : 9, first part.
  NOTE.—" Fear," that which demands reverence is ap-
plied to the great and holy law of God's love, which de-
mands on the part of the soul that reverence for God
which is the beginning of wisdom. See Job 28:28; Prov.
1:7. God's law endures forever.. Ps. III: 7, 8.
  17. What sixth characteristic and its effect are
noted? Ps. 19:9, last part; 119:16o.
  18. What effect do all these qualities have upon
the converted soul? Ps. 19:1o.
    NoTE.--The testimony of this psalm to the law of God
 is the universal testimony of the entire Bible. The law
 of God, like its Author, is perfect, sure, right, clean, true,
 and righteous altogether, and, says Paul, holy, just, good,
 spiritual. ROM,7: 12, 14. There is only one reason why
 we should hate God's law, and that is the possessionof
'the carnal mind. Rom. 8:7.
  19. By what means and by whom may we be
brought to love God's law? Rom. 1:16, 17; Eze.
36:26, 27.
10            OLD TESTA '!ENT LESSONS,

  2o. What question does the Psalmist ask? and
what petition does he offer? Ps. 19: 12.
  NOTE.—Secret faults, faults not seen or realized by
himself.
  21. Who only knows the heart? and by what
agency does God reveal it to us? Jer. 17:9, to;
Ps. 19:11, first part; Rom. 7:7.
  22. From what sins dyes David earnestly pray
to be kept? Ps. 19:13.
   NOTE.—Presumptuous sins seem to be set opposite the
secret faults, or, rather, secret faults and presumptuous
sins make up the sum total of all sin. Presumptuous
sins are sins committed knowing them to be wrong, pre-
suming on God's mercy, or thinking that God is not par-
ticular. They may exist in all degrees, from slight depar-,
tures from God to the utmost defiance, as was the case in
Num 15: 3o, 31. See, also, Lcv. to: 1, 2; 2 Sam. 6:3-7.
We may commit secret faults without a violation of con-
science, because we do not know we have them, although
others may. But we cannot commit known sins without
presuming on God's mercy and benumbing our con-
science; and in stupefying conscience we fall rapidly till
we commit much transgression. Let us continually pray
that such sins may not have dominion over us. One of
the most blessed of friends is a conscience made and kept
tender by the Spirit of God.
   23. What, on the other hand, is said of keeping
God's commandments? Ps. 19: It; Rev. 22:14.
  NOTE.—There is not only a reward for keeping, as is
implied in the last scripture, but there is a reward in
keeping them, in doing God's will by the grace of Christ,
in walking with him.
  24.• What should be the daily prayer of every
heart? Ps..

     LESSON. IV.—FilaRILt 23,1892.
      THE LORD MY SHEPHERD.—PSALM 23.
                   (MEMORY VERSES i.-6.)
  GOLDEN TEXT.—" The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want." Ps.
23:1.

      WHo does David say is his shepherd? Verse
     1.
1, first part. The word "Lord" comes from "Je-
hovah."
    2. Through whom was Jehovah especially mani-
fested in such a tender relation? John to: II, first
clause; Heb. 13 : 20.
  NOTE.—It has been well remarked that if we would
appreciate the infinite trust and tenderness expressed in
this psalm, we must take into consideration the life of the
Syrian shepherd. He was constantly with his sheep,
nearly always alone. However large his flock, he knew
every sheep by name, and every sheep knew him. In
the cool, frosty nights, in the fierce heat of the noonday
sun, in the storm and tempest, in the rocky, rugged way
as well as in the green pastures, he was identified with
his flock, leading them to pastures of plenty, or imperiling
his life for their safety. All this was known to David, to
Moses, to Jacob, and others. I Sam. 17:34-36; Ex. 3: t;
Gen. 31:38-4o.
    3. What assurance may we draw from the fact
that the Lord is our Shepherd? Ps. 23:1, last
clause.
    4. What basis have we for such assurance?
Col. I: 19; 2:9.
    5. What does Jesus say of the relation between
him and his people? John re: 14, I.
24             OLD TESTAMENT LESSONS.

  NOTE.—The Revised Version reads thus: " I am the
Good Shepherd; and I know mine own, and mine own
know me, even as the Father knoweth me, and I know
the Father." They are all united by the same bond of
union, namely, the "life that is in God."
    6. How great is the love which Christ bears for
his sheep? John Jo: xi, last clause.
    7. Is such love manifested only toward the faith-
ful? Isa. 53:5, 6.
   8. What contrast does he draw between the true
and false shepherds? John to: r 1-13.
    9. How do his sheep regard his voice? Verses
2-4.
  1o. How do the sheep of the Lord regard the
voice of strangers? Verse 5.
    t. What blessing does he bestow upon them?
Ps. 23:2.
   NOTE.—The life of the Christian is not all conflict.
God gives the precious privilege now and then of quiet,
refreshful resting-places, where the soul may feed on the
bread of life, and rest while it partakes; where the long- '
ing heart may wander beside "the waters of rest," the
waters which bring rest, the communion of the Spirit of
God. Thus it is that we are prepared for the conflict,
just as such quiet and abundant feeding restores the lean
and fainting sheep, and fits them for enduring long and
tiresome journeys.
  12. What is the effect of these restful blessings
of God? Ps. 23:3, first part.
  13. How is the soul kept in this condition?
Verse 3.
  14. For whose sake does God grant all these
blessings to his people? Same verse.
               OLD TES TA MENT LESSONS.                 Yg

  NOTE.—This is a thought which should be ever kept
before us. God grants us no blessings because of our
worth to him. It is wholly by his grace, wholly for his
name's sake. It is often pity for the lost sheep which
moves the true shepherd to go forth, frequently periling
his life for its rescue; it was unmerited pity and bound-
less love alone which moved the heart of the Great Shep-
herd to give his life for the sheep.
  Is. How fully may we expect the Shepherd's
presence in the journey of life? Verse 4, first part.
The expression, "valley of the shadow of death"
denotes the profoundest darkness, but Christ will
be with us, even in the greatest trial.
  16. What comfort has the Christian in this dark-
ness? Verse 4; Isa.
   NOTE.—" Rod " is used to denote a kingly scepter, a
symbol of power, an instrument of correction and guid-
ance. It would fitly symbolize God's law, which, like the
shepherd's crook, brings the straying back to the path of
safety. See our last lesson.. " Staff" denotes a stay or
support," a means of defense, and would fittingly repre-
sent the gospel, the aggregation of all God's promises,
the only hope and stay of the people of God. In Zech.
II: 7 the shepherd had two staves; the name of one was
" Beauty" (margin, " Graciousness"); the name of the
other . was " Bands " (margin, " Binders " or " Union").
See Revised Version. These would fittingly represent
in the Great Shepherd the gospel and law, the fullness of
God's word, but, unlike the earthly shepherd's staves,
they can never be broken. " Comfort" does not simply
mean to console, but to strengthen and establish. And
that soul who trusts in the gospel of Christ, whose feet are
set in the way of his commandments, is indeed comforted
and established.
   17. What triumph does God give his servant in
36            OED TESTAMENT LESSONS.

the midst of his enemies? Ps. 23:5; Rom. 8:35, 37,
  18. What is always the result of one's cup run-
ning over with God's blessings? Ps. 4o:3.
  19. From the Psalmist's confidence in God, what
does he conclude? Ps. 23:6.
  20. In what house of God did the Psalmist ex-
pect to dwell? Eph. 2:19-22.


     LESSON V.—April 30, 1892.
THE PRAYER OF THE PENITENT.—PS 51:1-13.
                 (MEMORY VERSES, lo-13.)
  GOLDEN TEXT. -"Create in me a clean heart, 0 God; and renew a
right [constant) spirit within me." Ps. 5t: 10.

  INTRODUCTION.—The title to this psalm doubtless
gives its origin, but it is adapted to sinners of every age
and clime. It expresses the condition of a soul truly
humble and penitent.
   I. On what basis does David plead God's
mercy? Ps. 51:I, first part.
   2. Through what alone may we obtain pardon?
Titus 3:5-7.
   3. On what ground did David plead that the
record of his sin might be blotted out or wiped
away? Ps. 51: I, last part.
  NOTE.—Mark the gradations, " mercy," "loving-kind-
ness," "multitude of God's tender mercies." Have
compassion, pity, tenderness toward me, not in stinted
measure, for my sin is great, but according to thy loving-
kindness, even to blot out my transgressions (which are
many) " according to the mulli lude of thy tender mercies."
              OLD TESTAMENT LESSONS.                   17
The sinner's large plea for God's undeserved mercy.
shows a large conception of his sin.
    4. Does the truly penitent wish to retain any of
his sin? Verse 2.
 •NOTE.—Some versions have " t-h-o-r-o-u-g-h-l-y," while
the English versions have " t-h-r-o-u-g-h-l-y." They both
mean the same. The latter is the older form. The word
means "through and through."
   5. On what condition does God forgive sin?
 John t: 9.
   6. Did David meet these conditions? Ps. 51 :3.
   j. How did he regard his sin as related to God?
Verse 4, first part.
  NoTE.—It is said that the Hebrew manner of ex-
pression includes and swallows up all lesser things in the
greater, so that David's sin against God was so great
that it shut the other sins from his sight, so to speak.
Another way of looking at the text is this: David as king
could be called to account by no one save God, hence
his sin was against God as his sovereign. But in what-
ever way the Psalmist used the expression as regards the
particular wrongs done to Uriah the Hittite, the only
true sorrow for sin is that when the sinner considers the
greatest sin of all as committed against God.
   8. What acknowledgment does he make as to
God's justice? Verse 4.
   9. By what does he show that he recognizes the
root of his sin? Verse 5.
  NOTE.—He who fails- to realize that mortal flesh- is
essentially depraved, and that only the power of God
within can overcome the weaknesses and passions of the
flesh, will be defeated by the enemy. See Rom. 7: 14-
24; 8: 2, 3. David recognized, as every sinner should,
18             OLD TESTAMENT LESSONS.

not only the enormity of his particular sin, but the inher-
ent depravity of the natural man. There is no reflection
against his parents; the words are true of every soul of
man.
  Io. How does God desire truth to affect man?
Ps. 51:6; 15:2.
  it. What would the.ossession of this truth. and
wisdom within do for David? Prov. 3:13; Ps.

  12. How does David continue to plead with God
in regard to sin? Ps. 51:7, 8.
   NOTE.--It will be seen by reference to Lev. 14:3-7
that the purging of hyssop was not merely the cleansing,
it was an authoritative acquittal, or pronouncement that
the man was clean. David desires to be made perfectly
clean; he wants God's complete acquittal. He desires
to rejoice in the sentence of acquittal. His spiritual fall
he likens to a physical fall in which the hones have been
broken; he wants perfect healing from his fall.
   13 . How does he plead that God will regard his
 sins? Ps. 51: 9.
   14. What alone can hide our sins from God?
.Rom. 3:22; 4:6, 7.
   15. Is it simply forgiveness alone that the truly
 penitent desires? Ps. 51: to, margin.
   16. By what power are the new heart and spirit
 given? 2 Cor. 5:17; Eze. 36:26.
   17. Whose spirit is then within us? and how
 does it affect us? Rom. 8: 9; Eze. 36:27.
   18. Whose 'companionship does the truly repent-
 ant long for? Ps. 51:11.
   19. What great boon does he reask of God?
 Verse 12, first part.
                OLD TESTAMENT LESSONS.

  20. Is God willing to do this? i John 2: r, 2;
Micah 7:18, 19.
  21. How only did David expect to walk at liberty,
or be kept from falling? Ps. 51: 12; see e Cor. 3:
17; i Cor. 15:57, 58.
  22. What is the result of the indwelling of the
Spirit of God in the hearts of men? Ps. 51:13;
Isa. 6:7, 8; see John 1:4o, 41, 43, 45.
  23. May we know that God will hear such
prayers as David offered? Ps. 51:16, 17; Isa.
57:15.

    DELIGHT IN GOD'S HOUSE.—PS. 84:1-12.
                   (MEMORY" VERSES, 9-12.)
 GOLDEN TEXT. -"Blessed are they that dwell in Thy houst." Ps. 84:4..


   INTRODUCTION.—This psalm is divided into three parts,
of four verses each, the first four verses referring to
God's house, the second to the source of strength, the
third the blessings of God's presence.
     1. How did the Psalmist regard the. tabernacle
of the Lord? Ps. 84:i.
    NOTE —The" term. ".tabernacle"'Means '"dwellirig
place of God," and _generally..applies to the sanctuary in
the wilderness, or the templ e                         #4.4

 Inspiration uses it as a type of the spiritual house of God.
  2. How great was his longing for the house of
God? Verse 2.
20              OLD TESTAMENT LESSONS.

     3. Why did he long for the courts of God?
Last part of verse 2.
     4. By what example does he illustrate the ten-
der love of God? Verse 3.
   Nom.—Boothroyd gives an altogether different render-
ing of this verse, which he contends the original justifies,
and which considerably changes the meaning: " Yea, as
the sparrow findeth a house, and the swallow a nest for
herself where she may lay her young, so I seek thine
altars, Jehovah, God of hosts, my King and my God."
The thought is that just as the spaerow and swallow make
it their first business, when the season comes, to build
them a nest, a home, so the child of God seeks the altars
of God, where he may dwell in the presence of his King.
The sense is clearer than is expressed in the common
version. If the idea expressed in our text is correct, it
would illustrate the peace and safety'of the house of God,
even to the birds, whose instinct led them there. If in-
stinct, how much more faith.
     5. What does the Psalmist say of those who
dwell in God's house? Verse 4.
   NOTE.—The Psalmist could not have had reference to
living in the literal tabernacle or temple, for this fact of
itself did not change the character. For the iniquity com-
mitted by those connected with the literal temple see
Ezekiel 8, and the case of Eli and sons, i Samuel 2 to
4. The literal temple of God would be too narrow a
meaning. The spiritual house of God, the church, the
temple, built by Christ is evidently meant. Zech. 6: 13.
The word "Selah" occurs some seventy-four times in
the. Bible. The rabbins held it to mean "forever," but
it is generally considered as indicating some change in
the music.
     6. In what house of God may we abide and be
blessed? Eph. 2 : 59-22 ; Heb. 3: 6.
            OLD TESTAMENT LESSONS.                     2l
    7. How should we regard the assembling to-
gether of the people of.God? Heb. 1o: 25; John
4: 24.                      •
    8. What alone makes the meeting-place of
God's people precious? Matt. 18: 20.
    9. What does the Psalmist say of those who are
strong in the Lord? Ps. 84: 5.
  NOTE.—Boothroyd renders the last part of the verse,
"Confidence reigns in the heart." The Revised Version,
"In whose heart are the highways of Zion."
   Io. What does even the desolate land of weep-
ing (Baca, a place of weeping), become to them?
Verse 6.
  NOTE.—" Though they pass through the desolate val-
ley, yet shall they drink from a fountain; yea, the [early,
R. V.] rain shall cover it with blessings."—Boothroyd.
See Jer. 17:8.
     1. What is this fountain, or well, from which
they drink? John 4:13, 14.
   12. What marks the course of those who thus
trust God? Ps. 84: 7.
   13. By what power do they make this progress?
 Rom. :16, 17.
   14. What petition does the Psalmist make for
such attainments? Ps. 84: 8. -
   NOTE.—His petition is to the Ever-living One, the God
 of Hosts, who is abundantly able to help, the covenant
 God, who cannot break his promise.
    15. By what term does he show that he trusts in
 God? Verse 9, first clause.
    16. Whom does he present before God in his
kd               OLD TESTAMENT LESSONS.

behalf? Same verse, last clause. God's Anointed
is the Messiah, our Lord Jesus Christ. See John I:
41, margin.
   17. What comparison does he make between
God's house, the time spent there, and those places
and times when God's presence is not manifested?
Verse io.
   18. What does he say that God is to his people?
Verse it, first part..
   NOTE.—The sun gives light, the shield protects. Such
is God to his people. He is a light in darkness, he pro-
tects in danger. His light leads in duty; his strength or
shield defends in the conflict.
  19. What will he give to his people? Verse
second clause.
  20. Into what will God's grace ripen in the
hearts of those who receive it? Rom. 5: I, 2; Eph.
1:6, 18.
  21. How are the gifts of God summed up to us?
Ps. 84:11, last clause. See Rom. 8:28; I Cor. 3:
2E-23.
22. What does the Psalmist conclude in view of
God's goodness and power? Ps. 84:12.

  1. To what extent did David consider the Lord
worthy of praise or blessing? Ps. to3: 1.

    2. What duty did he enjoin with the blessing?
Verse 2.
    3. What did he name among these benefits?
Verses 3-6.
    4. In forgiving the iniquities of those who re-
ceive him, what does God impute and- impart to
them? Roin. 4:6, 7; 3: 22.
    5. What is a necessary accompaniment of right-
eousness? Rom. 5:18; 8:1o, last clause.
    6. Is healing of disease always accomplished
here for those who possess that life? See 2 Tim.
4:20; Heb.       35-38.
    7. But, if we go on from faith to faith, of what is
that life or spirit within us a pledge? Rom. 5:17;
8: 11.
  8. When, then, will all diseases be healed? Rom.
8:11; Isa. 25:8, 9; 33:24.
  NOTE.—That Ps. 103:3 is sometimes true in particular
cases in this life is abundantly verified; but, with very few
exceptions, all of the race have eventually yielded to dis-
ease and death. While forgiveness and healing are both
classed together, God has declared over and over again
that he would forgive all of our sins while we are mortal.
This we know to be his will. We may plead it with all
confidence. But God has never declared that he would
heal all diseases here. In the life hereafter, however, all
diseases will be healed; we will be made immortal, in-
corruptible, like our blessed Lord (Phil. 3:21); of this
God has given us a pledge in granting us forgiveness of
sin, and bestowing upon us the gift of righteousness,
which is also the gift of life—eternal life—if the righteous-
ness is retained.

   12. Among these ways what preCious trait of
 character has he revealed? Ex. 34:6, 7; Ps. 103:8.
   13. How will he ever regard the truly penitent,
even though his sins have been grievous? Ps. 103:
9; Micah 7:18.
   14. What do our sins merit us? Rom. 6: 23.
   15. What proof is given that God has been gra-
cious to us, has dealt with us better than we de-
serve? Ps. 103: 10-12.
   16. How does he regard our weaknesses? Verses
13, 14; Isa. 63:9; Heb. 4:15.

DANIEL AND HIS COMPANIONS.—DAN.
                   (MEMORY VERSES 17-19.)-

  GOLDEN TEXT.-" Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile
himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he
drank." Dan. r : 8.


  INTRODUCTION.—The time covered by this lesson was
6o6 to 603 B. c. Jeremiah (25: t) says it was in the fourth
year of Jehoiakim; Daniel says (1: I), in the third year of
the same king. It is supposed that Jeremiah followed the
Jewish mode of reckoning, counting a part of an unfin-
ished year the whole year, even though that part con-
sisted of only a few months. Jehoiakim reigned two full
years and parts of two other years, counted as years by
Jeremiah. Daniel followed the Assyrian mode, which •
began the reign of any king from the next new year after
his accession to the throne. For instance, if a new king's
reign should begin in August, the old king's reign would
be continued in the chronological accounts till the new
year came, and then the reign of the new king would be-
gin. Thus both Jeremiah and Daniel are correct. The
place of our lesson was Babylon, a great city, then in the
 height of its power, 500 miles east of Jerusalem, in the
 valley of the Euphrates.
   1. Because of the folly of Hezekiah what pre-
diction did the Lord make concerning that king's
seed? Isa. 39:5-7.                     •
 , 2. Who among these did Nebuchadnezzar
choose for the purpose of giving them an educa-
tion in the affairs of state? Dan. I: 3, 4.
26            OLD TESTAMEN7' LESSONS.

   NOTE.—Mark the character of those chosen. The
word " children " is " youths " in Revised Version.
     3. What daily provision was made for their
physical needs? Verse 5, first part.
   NOTE.—The word " meat " simply means "food."
This use is quite common in England now. It is used in
America in speaking of the kernel of a nut.
     4. For hoiv long were they to be thus taught
and nourished? Same verse, last part.
     5. What ones who afterward became noted
were among these youths of Israel? Verse 6.
     6. What change did Ashpenaz make in the
names of these young men? Verse 7.
   NOTE.—Evidently the king designed by this sumptu-
ous fare, the great pains taken with them, and the flat-
tering names given to them, to win them from their own
religion to that of Babylon. As their own names brought
to their mind the God of Israel, so the names given them
connected them with heathen gods. Daniel meant "God
is my judge," or "God's judge;" Hananiah, "whom
Jehovah graciously gave; " Mishael, " who is what God
is; " Azariah, " whom Jehovah aids." Their names given
by Nebuchadnezzar were Belteshazzar, "favored by Bel ;"
Shadrach, "command of Aku (the moon-god);" Me-
shach, Peloubet says, "perhaps connected with Mas, a
protecting genius or demigod;" Abed-nego, "servant of
Nebo."
     7. What course did Daniel and his companions
take with reference to the food furnished from the
royal table? Verse 81
   NoTE.--The food furnished Daniel might have been
objectionable to him for several reasons: (t) It might
have been contrary to the law of God (Leviticus ri); (2)
it might not have been properly cleansed from blood
(Lev. 17: to); (3) it might have been offered to idols; (4)
             OLD TESTAMENT LESSONS.                     27

it might have been rich and unhealthful (Prov. 23:1-3).
The wine was doubtless intoxicating, and he remembered
the words of the Lord through his royal progenitor.
Prov. 23:29-32.
      8. By what were they tempted?
    NOTE.—"They were teinpted : ( t) By appetite; the love
of the king's luxuries and wine. (2) By their ambitions and
hopes of success. How could they expect to succeed
with a heathen king, when they were so set in a religion
 which condemned him and his conduct? (3) By the king's
command. Why should they not yield to it as to an in-
 evitable necessity—their very life might depend upon it.
 (4) By the love of prosperity. Their course would make
 them appear odd, and subject them to ridicule, and bring
 them into many troubles."—Peloubet. Many Christians
 professing to be looking for Christ's coming yield princi-
 ple under much lighter temptations.
      9. How had Gbd already begun to work for
 Daniel? Dan. 1:9; see Gen. 39: 21-23.
     io. What reply did. the prince of the eunuchs
 make? Dan. 1: io.
          How fairly did Daniel present the matter?
 Verses 11-13.
    NoTE.- -Pulse, "grain, vegetables, herbs, opposed to
  flesh arid more delicate food."—Gesenius. "Esculent
 seeds of leguminous plants,such as beans, peas, lentils. "—
  Century Dictionary. The Hebrew word means "seeds."
     12; What did God move Melzar (the steward)
  to decide? Verse 14..
       3. What was the result of the trial? Verses
  15,16.
     14.. How did God regard the integrity and faith
  of these young men? Verse 17, first part.
     15. What special favors did he show Daniel?
  Same verse, last part,
 28               OLD TESTAMENT LESSONS.

   16. What did the king find in comparing them
 with the others who had taken this three years'
 course of training? Verses 18, 19.
   17. What position did he give them because of
 this? Verse 19, last clause. They were made
 officers and advisers of responsibility. See Gen.
41:46.
   18. How did the king find them as compared
 with all the wise and great men of his kingdom?
 Dan. i :zo.
   19. What is said of Daniel's continuance? Verse
21.

    NOTE.—He lived longer than this, but this date is
  mentioned as the time when God's people were delivered.
• There are few Old Testamept characters more worthy of
  study and imitation than Daniel,. "greatly beloved" of
  God. The secret of his life is shown in his faithfulness
  and integrity in what many would call a small thing, the
  mere matter of diet. God, however, vindicated his course
  and left us his example. Daniel knew that sacrifice or
  compromise of principle was not a small matter; he could
  not afford it; neither can any Christian.
     "Dare to be a Daniel, dare to stand alone,
       Dare to have a purpose firm, dare to make it known."

 with whom we have to do," Heb. 4: 13.


       i. By what means did God trouble the mind of
              OLD TESTAMENT LESSONS.                  21)

Nebuchadnezzar when he was established in his
kingdom? Dan. 2: 1.
    2. What, success did he have in learning by his
wise men the dream and its interpretation? Verses
10-12.
   3. When the news came to Daniel, what did he
do? Verses 14-16.
   4. Of whom did Daniel seek counsel? and what
was the result? Verses 17-19; 1:17, last clause.
   '5. To whom did Daniel give all the glory?
Dan. 2 : 20-23.     •
   6. For what purpose was the dream given?
Verses 28-30.
    7. Relate the dream. Verses 31-35.
    8. What did Daniel interpret the head of gold
to mean? Verses 36-38.
  NoTE. — This is an unequivocal starting-point. Nebu -
chadnezzar, not as a single king, but as representing the
Babylonian dynasty, was the " head of gold." This is
shown by another " kingdom," not king, following. The
word "king" is used as representing kingdom all through
the book of Daniel.
    9. What was represented by the breast and arms
of silver? Verse 39, first part; 5: 3o, 31; 8: 20.
   10. What is represented by the belly and thighs
of brass? Dan. 2: 39, last part; 8 : 2I .
  11. What did he say of the fourth kingdom?
Dan. 2 : 40; see 7: 7.
  12. Of what kingdom have we next a record in
the word of God? Luke 2:1. Caesar was an em-
peror of Rome.
  13. What prediction of this power did God give
30            OLD TESTAMENT LESSONS. .


nearly a thousand years before Daniel's time?
Deut. 28:49, 5o.
  14. What was indicated by the mixture of iron
and clay? Dan. 2 : 41, first part.
  NOTE. — It is well to mark that the division of the em-
pire is not indicated by the toes, as stated by some com-
mentators, but by the mixture of iron and clay. As the
feet and toes were part of clay andparl of iron, so the king-
dom was to be divided.
  15. What would be the characteristics of the
kingdom? Verses 41, 42.
  NOTE. —Great strength and great weakness. Strong
to resist any other power, as represented by the iron; so
weak as never to become united, because of the inter-
mingling of the clay. The iron well represents imperial-
ism, that which seeks to dominate all, the strongest gov-
ernment among men, while clay represents the republican
element, weak in cohesive power, tending always to di-
vision. These characteristics have been most prominent
in European powers.
  16. What effort would these divisions make to
unite or amalgamate? Verse 43.
 NOTE. — This is generally understood to refer to inter-
marriages among royal families, in order to unite govern-
ments; but all efforts of man are futile. One line of God's
word is mightier than all the powers of earth.

  17. What did the prophet declare would occur
in the last days of this divided kingdom, as repre-
sented by the "stone cut out without hands "?
Verse 44.
   /8. How will that kingdom be set up? and how
                  OLD TESTAMENT LESSONS.                          31

long will it endure? Verse 44; Ps. 2:8, 9; Luke
1:32, 33.
  19. What did the prophet of God say of the
dream and its interpretation? Dan. 2:45.
  20. What did Daniel's revelation bring him and
his companions? Verses 46, 48, 49.
  21. But to whom, as the Revealer of secrets, did
the great monarch give the glory after all? Verse
47.
  22. What great truths may we learn from this
lesson? Golden text; Isa. 46:9, io; Rom. 15:4.

         THE FIERY FURNACE.—DAN.3: 13-25.
                     (MEMORY VERSES, 16-18.)
  GOLDEN TEXT.—"When thou walkest through the fire, t:iou shalt not be
burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee." Ps. 43: 2.



  INTRODUCTION.— The date of this lesson is not certain,
but was probably about 58o B. c., after Nebuchadnezzar
had completed his conquest of surrounding nations, as
predicted by Jeremiah (27: 2-8). The place was the plain
of Dura, about five miles southeast of Babylon. There is
a huge mound of brick there at the present time, about
seven yards high, which Offert believes to be the base, or
pedestal, of the great image.
   i. What idolatrous act did Nebuchadnezzar
perform when established in his empire? Dan. 3: I.
   NOTE.—The        height of this image was ninety feet, its
Sd              OLD TESTAMENT LESSONS.

breadth nine feet. The height probably included that of
the pedestal, and, covered with gold plates, could be seen
a great distance. It was, doubtless, an image of the pro-
tecting divinity of Babylon, Bel-Merodach. The word
translated "image" means the image of a man
   2. What decree did he make? Verses 2-7.
   3. What complaint came to the king in refer-
ence to this decree? Verses 8-12.
  NoyE.—The" Hebrews were accused by the learned
Chaldeans. Doubtless they felt envious because the He-
brews were placed above them.
   4. What was then done? Verse 13.
   5. What question did Nebuchadnezzar ask
them? Verse 14.
  NOTE.—Nebuchadnezzar wished to give the Hebrews
a fair trial and all the benefit of any doubt. "Is it of
purpose," he asked (see margin), "that you did this."
    6. What alternative did he set before them?
Verse 15.
    7. What insult did he offer God? Same verse,
last part. See similar boasting in Isa. 37: 10-13.
    8. What time to consider their reply did the
three men wish? Dan. 3:16.
  NOTE.—"We are not careful," Revised Version, "We
have no need." It was a matter of principle, and, as the
principle of right was in their heart, they desired no time.
They might have taken time and reasoned: (I) It is
only for once, and that will not change our characters;
(2) we will still hold our own religion at heart; (3) the
king, too, ought to be obeyed; God has made him ruler
(Jer. 27:6-8), and, of course, we ought to be "subject to
the higher powers," as God has ordained; (4) Nebuchad-
              OLD TESTAMENT LESSONS.                 33

nezzar had befriended them, and, of course, they ought
not to displease him; (5) their lives were at stake, and
they might do as their fathers had done before them;
(6) if they refused to obey, they would die, but if they
yielded, they would liVe, and how much more good they
could then do as rulers in that idolatrous nation. These
and other vain excuses might have been urged by these
faithful men. But they took the only safe way. They
neither parleyed with the enemy, nor did they wish time
to consider a matter of right or wrong. They could die,
but could not yield. Compromise was sin, and right can
never compromise with wrong and remain right.

    9. What faith in God did they express? Verse
17.
  10. But if it were not God's will to deliver them,
what was their choice? Verse 18.
  NOTE.—They had faith to be saved from trial, in trial,.
by trial, whatever and whichever way God thought best.
For him they could stand alone, but God stands with
them. When we stand for God, he stands with us.

  t. How did their reply affect the king? and
what did he command? Verses 19, 29.
12. How was the ,command executed? Verses
21, 23.
  13. How were the strong men affected who cast
them into the furnace? Verse 22.
  14. What revelation was immediately made to
the king? Verses 24, 25.
   NOTE.—The better translation of the term rendered
 "Son of God" is, doubtless, that of the Revised Version,
 "a son of the gods." Nebuchadnezzar, a heathen, did
 not know Christ; and yet it was Christ who was with

them. They were with him in the right; he was with
them in the suffering.
  15. What did the king immediately do? Verses
26, 27.
  16. What acknowledgment did Nebuchadnezzar
make? Verse 28. He acknowledged their honesty,
integrity, and righteousness.
  17. What decree did he issue? Verse 29.
  NOTE.—Little did these men know what would be the
outcome of their simple faith, that it would be the means
of having the knowledge of the great God carried
throughout that mighty empire in royal decree, by royal
heralds. They decided for God irrespective of conse-
quences. God used their simple,faith to enlighten the
world. It is always thus.
  18. What was done with Shadrach, Meshach,
and Abed-nego? Verse 3o.
  19. What promise of God was exemplified in the
case of these men? Golden text.
  20. By what power were they kept from sinning
against God? Ps. 17:4; 119: H.
  21. How will persecutions always result if faith-
fully borne? Phil. 12.

important position was Daniel called to fill in his

     2. What spirit did this stir up in the other offi-
cers? and what did they endeavor to do? Verse
4, first part. See Prov. 27:4.
     3. What was-the result of their effort? and why?
Dan. 6: 4, last two parts.
     4. To what conclusion did their jealousy and
envy-lead them? Verse 5.
     5. What action did they take to accomplish

plaint? and how did it affect the king? Verses 13,

accede to Daniel's destruction? Verse 15.

the hope of the king? Verses i6, 17.

Verses 2 1 , 22.
   14. By what means and power was Daniel kept?
 Verse 23; Ps. 34: 7.
  NOTE. —First of all, Daniel was God's servant, he was
 ad               OLD TESTAMENT LESSONS.

not, therefore, the servant of men. i Cor. 7:23. He knew
that right was of God and right would win. He knew
that to deny his faith in face of the law was to deny God,
was to show to his enemies that he did not believe that
God would help him in time of trouble. Note that he
made no display of his faith or lack of faith; he did not
defy the unjust law nor show that he despised it; neither
did he cringe or compromise; he simply did as he had
always done. His purpose to do God's will was not
affected in the least by the law. He was living the heav-
enly life.
"Count me o'er earth's chosen heroes,—they were souls that stood alone
  While the men they agonized for hurled the cont umelious stone,
  Stood serene, and down the future saw the golden beam incline
  To the side of perfect justice, mastered by their tsith divine,
  By one man's plain truth to manhood and to God's supreme design."
                                                           —Lowell.

  15. By what means and power are the people of
God kept from the superabounding evils of the last
days? r Peter 1:5.
  16. How did the lions treat the accusers of
Daniel? Dan. 6:24.
  17. How did this experience result for Daniel?
Verse 28.
  18. How did it result for the cause of God?
Verses 25-27.
   NOTE.—There is no reason to suppose that Daniel ex-
pected great results to flow from his simple faith in God
apart from his own connection with God. But such are
the acts which God uses to advance his kingdom. Most
of his people had departed from him and were in captivity.
A new empire ruled the world. The world must be en-
lightened even if God's people would not do it. God so
overruled here, as in the case of Daniel's companions, that
            OLD TESTAMENT LESSONS.                     37

the head of the government issued a decree which pro-
mulgated the name and somewhat of the character of the
true God to the entire empire. That very proclamation
must have given opportunity to many honest hearts to
find the true God. We will never realize the fruits of
Daniel's faith till we see the redeemed souls in the king-
dom of Christ. God makes the wrath of man to praise
him.

    LESSON XI11.—dune 25, 1892.
            MESSIAH'S REIGN.—PS. 72:1-19.
                     (MEMORY VERSES, 7,3)
  GOLDEN TEXT. —"All kings shall fall down before Him; all nations shall
serve Him." Ps. 72::x.

  INTRODUCTION.—From the title, the introduction, and
the close of this psalm, it would seem that it was written
by David, a prayer for his son Solomon, who had just
ascended the throne, and, through Solomon, predictive of
Him, the " Greater than Solomon." The prediction of
Christ's reign is colored, or combined, or coalesced, with
the royal Psalmist's prayer for his son. The Revised
Version gives as an alternative reading of "he shall,"
and they shall," "let him," "let them," etc., through-
out the psalm. This would make it a prayer instead of a
prediction. In either case the psalm is true of "great
David's Greater Son." Solomon is a twofold type of
Christ, or, rather, a type of Christ in two different phases
of his work: (t) In building the literal temple of the Lord
as Christ builds on his Father's throne the spiritual temple
(Zech. 6: 12; 13; Eph. 2:20, 21); (2) in his peaceful reign
over the typical promised land after his father had put
down all enemies, even as Christ reigns in peace forever in
his own kingdom after the Father bath put all foes under
his feet (Ps. Ito: 1). The work and reign of Christ in both
 phases are presented in this psalm.
      I.   What prayer does David make for Solomon?
Ps.   72: I.
    2. Having God's righteousness, how would he
judge the people, and what would be their con-

   3. How much more true is this of Christ and his
subjects? Verses 4-7; Isa. II: 3 and first clause of
verse 4.
   4. How great was the dominion of Solomon?
  Kings 4:21.
   5. Over how much of the earth will Christ's
kingdom extend? Ps. 72:8.
   6. What is said of his enemies? Verse 9; Isa.
11:4, last part; Rom. 14:11, 12.
   7. What is said of the homage which shall be
rendered to him, and of his character? Ps. 72:
10-14.
   NOTE.—When this universal homage of Christ is re-
ferred to, as it is in several places in the Scriptures, it
is not to be understood that all the earth will be con-
verted, and that all kings will yield him willing worship
and service. The entire reign of Christ as king, and his
great love and pity for his people, manifested throughout
the whole of probation, are shown in this psalm. It is true
that an unnumbered throng will accept of Christ by faith.
ReV. 7: 9. It is true that when Christ appears, and the
wicked dead are raised to be judged, everyone will not
only bow before him in the abject and feigned homage of
fear and terror (Ps. 66:3, margin; 18:44, margin), but
they will also humble themselves before the people of
God, whom they have despised (Rev. 3:9). It is true
that the wicked will be destroyed root and branch. Mal.
4:-1 ; Obediah 16, and many other places. It is true that
all who are then left "will be all righteous," and will with
willing hearts serve Christ forever. Isa. 6o: zo, 21; Rev.
5:13; 21 :24.
  8. How were these blessings fulfilled in part to .
King Solomon? 2 Chron. 9:1-9, 2o-?8,
             OLD TESTAMENT LESSONS.                    41

      9. What is further predicted of Christ? Ps. 72:
15.
   NOTE.—The Revised VerSlon reads: "And they [those
whom Christ saves] shall live; and to him shall be given
of the gold of Sheba; and men shall pray for him con-
tinually; they shall bless him all the day long." If
this be the correct reading, it would seem to have refer-
ence to the life which Christ gives through his righteous-
ness to all who trust in him, both here and hereafter.
The prayers would be the prayers of saints offered to
Christ as High Priest, the prayers perhaps for his coming,
and the continual praise which is now offered to him, and
will be throughout eternity. If the proper reading is,
" He shall live," it would have reference to the eternal
triumph of Christ over death. "Knowing that Christ
being raised from the dead dieth no more; death bath no
more dominion over him." Rom. 6:9; see also Rev. r:
18. The giving of the gold of Sheba has no doubt some
reference to the generous gifts of the people of God in
this life, which has been fulfilled in every land and age
where the gospel has been preached. It will be pre-
eminently fulfilled in the earth made new. See Rev. 21:
24.
  10. What is said of the abundance of Christ's
graces and kingdom? Ps. 72:16; Isa. S5: 12, 13.
  NOTE.—The Revised Version translates Ps. 72:16 as
follows: " There shall be abundance of corn in the earth
upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall
shake like Lebanon; and they of the city shall flourish
like grass of the earth." Boothroyd translates: "Abun-
dance of corn shall be on the ground; on the tops of the
mountains its crops shall rustle like the trees that grow
on Lebanon; and citizens shall flourish as the grass of the
earth." This may denote the abundant blessings of the
gospel as well as those of the new earth.

    t. What is said of the name of this king? Ps.
72:17, first two clauses; see margin, and Acts 4:
12; Jer. 23:6.
   12. What will come to man through him? Ps. 72 :
17, last two clauses; Gen. 22: 17, 18.
   13. Through what do all these blessings come?
Gal. 3: 8; Rom. 1:16, 17.
   14. How far is that gospel to reach? Rev. 14:
6, 7.
   15. How broad and ample are its provisions?
Rom. to: 12, 13.
   16. What is said of the condition and blessings
of those who bear these glad tidings to the world?
Isa. 6: 5-8; Rom. to: 15.
   17. How should we feel toward God for the ines-
timable privilege of being coworkers with him in
advancing his kingdom? Ps. 72:18, 19.
