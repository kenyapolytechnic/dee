Lessons from the Acts of the Apostles.

   8. What time of-day was it? Acts 26:13.
   9. What followed the appearance of the bright
light? Acts 9:4; 26:14.
   NOTE.—L" It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks."
These words of Jesus throw light on Saul's career, if they
do not reveal the secret of his zealous persecution. They
show that he was fighting against conviction. He was
conscientious. Acts 24: 16. He was zealous for God,
although not according to knowledge. He regarded the
new sect as dangerous to the cause of God; and, not
knowing the liberty of the gospel, he supposed that force
might be used in the matters of religion. But he had
heard Stephen's discourse, and a conviction that these
persecuted ones might be right would persistently thrust
itself upon him. This conviction he regarded as a sinful
thought, and, shocked that he could for a moment harbor
such a thought, he would redouble his efforts against the
church. So at last Christ himself appeared to him,* and
Saul at once yielded. This should be a lesson to us to
be careful how we accuse those who oppose the truth, of
being dishonest. They may, like Paul, be kicking against
the pricks. If we say that these have heard the truth, we
must remember that Saul had also, and that it had been
preached with a power more than human. It would be
difficult for any man to be more bitter against the truth
than Saul was; yet he was sincere, and afterwards
preached the faith which he once destroyed. This record
is given to emphasize the lesson that the Saviour has
given us, that we should in every case withhold judg-
ment.
  10. What was the reply to Saul's question as to
who was speaking to him? Acts 9:5.
    .To show him that this conviction was not from Satan but from him.
               LESSONS FROM THE ACTS.                    5

    t. For what purpose did the Lord say he had
appeared to him? Acts 26:16-18.
  12. Where was he sent to find out what he
should do? Acts 9:6; 22: IO.
  13. How intelligible was the conversation to
Saul's associates? Acts 9:7.; 22:9•
  14. How had the light affected Saul? Acts 9:
8; 22: 11.
  15. How did he spend the three days following
his entrance into Damascus? Acts 9: 9•
  16. Whom did the Lord send to him? Verses
10-12.
  17. What did the Lord say to Ananias, to remove
his doubts? Verses 13-16.
  NOTE.-" I will show him how great things he must suf-
fer for my name's sake." Saul was called to suffering; so
are all that will live godly in Christ Jesus. 2 Tim. 3:12;
Phil. t: 29; I Thess. 3:3. The secret of Paul's steadfast-
ness was that he recognized this calling from the first.
He never encountered anything unexpected. The men
who apostatize when persecution arises are the ones who
have calculated on having an easy time. They are the
men for whom the way has been cleared, so that they
could embrace the truth without any difficulty. They are
like the soldiers who enlist thinking that army life is all
dress parade, and who very naturally run when they see
fighting. But the true soldier enlists with the understand-
ing that he may receive wounds. So the men who enter
the cause of God expecting tribulation, will not be moved
by it. But while God calls men to suffering, he at the
same time makes known to them his own joy, so that
they can say that this "light affliction, which is but for a
 moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eter-
 nal weight of glory." 2 Cor. 4:17. See also Rom. 8:18.

lar? Luke 8 : 49-56.
    13. What signs did Jesus say should go with
believers? Mark 16:17, 18.
    14. How great works did he say should be done
by those who believe on him? John 14:12-14:
    15. Is this promise limited to believers in any
particular age?
   NOTE. Jesus said, "These signs shall follow them that
believe," naming several. And again, " Verily, verily, I
say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I
do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall
he do; because I go unto my Father." What greater
works can be,done it is impossible to say; but we have
the word of Christ that they shall be done. Those who
ask, " Why don't we see some miracles, if they are to be
in the church till the end of time? " do not realize that
in every age the gifts of the Spirit have been manifested
in the church, although often to a limited extent. But i f
it is asked why miracles are not so common now as in the
first century, we can only reply by pointing to the condi-
tions. When the same devotion, unselfishness, faith, and
zeal are seen among believers, then the same power may
be expected to be seen in the church.


    LESSON I11.—Oetober 15, 1892.
          PETER'S VISION.—ACTS t o :1-29.
               (MEMORY VERSES, 1-4.)
  GOLDEN TEXT. —" Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of per-
sons." Acts so:34.

    i. Describe the character of Cornelius the cen-
turion. Acts 10: 1, 2.
8               LESSONS FROM THE ACTS.

  Nora.—In the case of Cornelius we have a striking illus-
tration of Christ's words, "If any man will do His will,
he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or
whether I speak of myself." John 7:17. God wants to
save men. He is on the lookout for men to save. So
anxious is he to save them that he rejects no candidate,
but wherever he sees one feeling after him, he at once
takes his hand and leads him out into the clear light. Of
his servant, in whose hands is the difficult task of making
holy people out of the most unpromising material, he
says: "A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smok-
ing flax shall he not quench; he shall bring forth judgment
unto truth. He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he
have set judgment in the earth." Isa. 42 :3, 4.
    2. What appeared to him one day as he was
praying? Verse 3.
    3. What message did the angel bring him?
Verses 4-6.
    4. What did he do in response to the words of
the angel? Verses 7, 8.
    5. As the men drew near to Joppa the next day,
what was Peter doing? Verses g, Io.
    6. Relate Peter's vision in detail. Verses II-16.
   NOTE.—There are probably few nowadays who take so
superficial a view of this portion of Scripture as to suppose
that it is meant to teach that all animals are equally clean,
and may be eaten. The distinction between clean and
unclean beasts .was not an arbitrary one, but was inherent
in the nature of the beasts. That nature remains the same
to-day that it always was. Moreover, Peter plainly tells
the object of the vision. It was intended as an impressive
lesson to teach him that he was not to sit in judgment on
men, calling one clean and another unclean. He is not
to judge that one man is beyond the possibility of salva-
              LESSONS FROM THE ACTS.                   9

tion, but is to sow beside all waters, not knowing
"whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether
they both shall be alike good." Eccl. II:6.
    7. What followed as soon as the vision passed?
Verses 17, 18.
    8. How was Peter prepared to receive the mes-
sage which the men brought? Verses 19, zo.
    9. In what words did they reply to Peter's ques-
tion as to their business with him? Verses 21, 22.
   ro. When did they return to Csarea? Verse
23.
    1. What precaution was taken to have wit-
nesses of what took place? Verse 23, last part.
   12. What preparation had Cornelius made for
Peter's arrival? Verse 24.
   13. What took place when he met Peter? Verses
25, 26.
   14. What did Peter say when he went in and
found the company assembled? Verses 27-29.
   15. What law forbade a Jew to keep company
with one of another nation?
   NOTE.—The student will search in vain throughout the
Old Testament to find any law whereby God forbade the
Jews to associate with the Gentiles. It is true that he
forbade them to intermarry with the heathen, and so he
still forbids his people to be unequally yoked with unbe-
lievers. Likewise he calls his people to come out from
the world, and be separate. As in the old time, so
now, he wants his people to be a peculiar people; but
nowhere do we find in ancient times he wanted his people
to be any more distinct and separate from the world than
he does now. The law to which Peter referred was
10             LESSONS FROM THE ACTS.

simply one of the traditions of the Jews by which they
 made void the law of God. See Matt. 15: 1-9; Mark 7 :
1-13. God was emancipating Peter from the shackles of
Jewish tradition. If he had not been so firmly bound, he
 would have learned the same lesson from the life of
 Christ, who never paid any attention to the traditions
 which Jewish bigotry had invented.
   16. What did Peter say that God had showed
him? Verse 28, last part.
    17. What are God's people not to do? Malt. 7:
1; Rom. 14:4; James 4:11, 12.
   18. When only is judgment to be rendered?
Cor. 4:5.
   19. When will the saints be allowed to judge
men? Dan. 7:22.
   20. Until that time what is the church's only
office? Matt. 5: 14-16; Phil. 2: 14-16.
   21. State some of the evidences that before the
first advent of Christ, as well as after, God wanted
his people to be missionaries.
   NOTE. —That God's design for the Jews was that they
should be a missionary people, is plainly shown in the
Scriptures. To Abraham God said, " In thee shall all fam•
ilies of the earth be blessed." Gen. 12:3. He had also
said to him, "Thou shalt be a blessing." Therefore all
who are children of Abraham must likewise be a blessing.
Long before the first advent of Christ, God had spoken of
himself through Isaiah as "a light to the Gentiles," as
well as the Restorer of Israel. Isa, 49:6. Moses had said
to Israel: "Behold, I have taught you statutes and judg-
ments, even as the Lord my God commanded me, that ye
should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it.
Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and
                LESSONS FROM THE ACTS.                        11


your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall
hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is
a wise and understanding people." Deut. 4:5, 6. This
shows that they were to let the nations know of God's
truth. The case of Naaman the Syrian, of the queen of
Sheba, of Jeremiah, sent to the nations round about Israel
(Jer. 27: 1-4, etc.), and of Jonah, sent to the Ninevites,
shows that God desired the salvation of other nations no
less than of Israel, and that he wished to use the Israel-
ites as the agents in their salvation.

  NOTE.-If anyone thinks that the Jews would certainly
have known it if their Scriptures had taught that the Lord
was as anxious for the salvation of other people as he was
for the salvation of the Jews, let him remember how impos-
sible it was for the disciples to grasp the idea that Christ
was going to die, which was not only contained in the
Scriptures, but was plainly and repeatedly declared to
them by the Saviour in person. It needed this outpour-
ing of the Spirit upon the Gentiles to convince the disci-
ples that God is no respecter of persons. But God is al-
ways the same, therefore he was never any respecter of
persons. So it was always true that "in every nation he

that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted
with him." Peter's tardy recognition of the truth did not
make it a new thing with God.

Verse 17.
   18. What was Herod's end? Verses 20-23.
   19. How successful was his attempt to crush out
the gospel? Verse 24.
   NOTE.—The fact that Herod was not able to keep Peter
in prison, shows that he did not have it in his power to
grant him any favors. He who has no power to punish,
has no power to protect. But the power of Herod repre-
sents the power of all civil governments. God's people
have nothing to receive of them, and should ask them
for nothing. Peter could do much more for Herod than
Herod could do for Peter. Even while Peter was in
prison, Herod might well have sought his protection.
" The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them
that fear him, and delivereth them," and they who have
that protection need no other. Indeed, if they seek any
other, they thereby tend to deprive themselves of that,
for by so doing they show their lack of faith in the Lord's
protection. The Lord says, " Put not your trust in
princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help."
 Ps. 146: 3. "Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for
his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God; which made
heaven, and earth." Verses 5, 6.
16              LESSONS FROM THE ACTS.


. But it may be said that God uses civil rulers to accom-
plish his purposes. That is true, and he alone knows
how and when to use them. None of them have any
power over his people except as he gives it to them.
John 19: it. Therefore, if he allows them to be put to
death, as in the case of Stephen and James, they may
know that it is his will. " He giveth his beloved sleep."
And if the Lord has work still for his servants to do,
they may rest confident that there is not power enough
in the world to keep them in prison.

   NOTE.-If this lesson were entitled " Paul's First Mis-
sionary Tour," it would more nearly express the fact in
the case than it now does. That would not be really
correct either, for when Paul went into the regions of
Syria and Cilicia, preaching the word, he was just as
truly on a missionary journey as at this time. Those who,
after the death of Stephen, went everywhere preaching
the word, were on a missionary journey just as surely as
Paul and Barnabas were. Philip was on a missionary
journey when he came to Samaria, and it was when he
was on a missionary trip that the eunuch was converted.
All these men were Christians, and were preaching
Christ. And it was before Paul was even converted. So
it is evidently a misnomer to entitle this lesson " The
First Christian Missionaries."

   NOTE.-It is worthy of notice that the Sabbath is men-
tioned four times in this chapter. In verse 27 it is referred
to as the time when the prophets are read in the syna-
gogues. It is said that this is done every Sabbath day.
This excludes any day from being called the Sabbath ex-
cept those days on which the Jews assembled for worship.
But the most important point to notice is the fact that the
day on which the Jews worshiped is called the Sab-
bath. The only reason for this is that that is its name.
The fourth commandment says that the seventh day is
the Sabbath. Ex. 20 : 10. The seventh day of the week
                LESSONS FROM THE ACTS.                             21

is the only day that the Lord named. All the other days
are designated simply by numbers; the seventh has a
name—the Sabbath. That should be sufficient to set-
tle the matter, but there is an opinion among some that
after Christ came things were entirely changed,—that he
came to make a revolution, to overthrow the Father's
work and substitute his own. On this see John 4 : 34;
5 : 19, 20, etc. But this chapter and other passages show
that in the New Testament things have the same names
that they do in the Old Testament. The only place
where we can learn of Christianity and Christian institu-
tions is in the Bible; therefore, since the Bible calls the
seventh day the Sabbath,.all Christians are bound to call
it the same. Without any controversy over the Old Tes-
tament, all Christians must agree that the New Testa-
ment was written far into what is commonly known as the
Christian era, by Christian men, for the guidance of Chris-
tians, and that it was inspired by the Holy Ghost. There-
fore the writers of the New Testament did not refer to the
seventh day as the Sabbath because they had in their early
life been accustomed to so call it, but because that is the
name the Holy Spirit gave it in the beginning, and in all
time since. No other day than the seventh can be called
the Sabbath as long as the Bible is taken as the only
standard of Christian faith and practice.

  NOTE.—It was not because of fear that the apostles fled
from one city to another when they were persecuted, as is
shown by the fact that they returned over the same road.
After Paul was stoned, he went back into the city,
and when they had finished their missionary tour, they
went back over every city that they had visited. They
fled because they were driven away, and could not at that
time do anything more in those places. The slight refer-
ence, also, that is made to the stoning of Paul, contains a
wonderful lesson, more expressive than anything else
could be. What a rebuke for those of us who are inclined
to make a great ado over even a little slight or reproach
that comes to us in the line of our work. It can be ex-
plained only by remembering that Paul had in him the
mind of Christ (see Phil. 2:5-7; John 4: 34; 2 Cor. 8:9;
 Heb. 2 : t, 2), and esteemed all these things as light afflic-
tions (2 Cor. 4:16-18).

apostles and elders at Jerusalem said of them that " cer-
tain which went out from us have troubled you with
words; subverting your souls; to whom we gave no com-
mandment." Verse 24, Revised Version. It will be
noticed that in the Old Version "such " is a supplied
word. Thus these men were irresponsible persons who
did not represent the church. The apostles were not in
sympathy with them. Their work was to subvert souls.
This they did by preaching a perverted gospel (Gal. 1:7),
for they were doing the same work that was afterwards
done by the men who tried to overthrow Paul's work in
Galatia. They professed to represent the church of
Christ, but only that they might the more readily gain
access to the disciples, to subvert them. They were
"false brethren," from whose malice Paul was often in
peril. See 2 Cor. 11:26.
   3. What standing had these men in the church?

them? Gal. 2:5.
   7. Then of what must the teaching of these men
have been subversive? Gal. 1 : 7; Acts 15:24.
  NOTE.—It should also be specially borne in mind that
the subject of the controversy was the gospel. That was
what made the question a vital one. It was concerning
how men must be saved. Paul and Barnabas preached
salvation by faith; these men taught salvation by man's
work. If men must be circumcised in order to be saved,
then faith in Christ would be proved to be insufficient.
                LESSONS FROM THE ACTS.                  25

 As Paul afterwards wrote, " If righteousness came by
 the law, then is Christ dead in vain." Gal. 2:21. More-
 over, the fact that the gospel was the subject of dispute
 is shown by Paul's statement that he resisted those men
•in order that the truth of the gospel might remain with
 his converts. Gal. 2:5. These false brethren professed
 to have the gospel, because they set forth what they
 claimed was the way of salvation; but there was no truth
 in their gospel. The truth of the gospel is that " through
 the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved,"
 and that " there is none other name under heaven given

cation of the heart God made no difference between the
Jews and the Gentiles. This is proof of the statement
that the subject under discussion was the vital one of
salvation. The fact that God "put no difference between
us and them " was shown in his giving to uncircumcised
Gentiles the gift of the Holy Ghost, even as he did to the
apostles and brethren on Pentecost. And the reason
why God thus put no difference between the Jews and the
Gentiles, in the matter of justification, was that " he
knoweth the hearts." There is no difference between
the heart of the Jew and the heart of thp Gentile, because
all alike have sinned. Rom. 3: 9, 22, 23. Men, judging
by the outward appearances, often make a difference be-
tween men, but God, who looks upon the heart, knows
that all are alike; therefore he puts no difference between
men in the matter of cleansing the heart.

disciples if the teaching of the false brethren was
adopted? Acts 15: 10.

free indeed." John 8:36.



    I. What was the cause of the trouble that arose
while Paul was preaching in Antioch?
   2. Tell what steps were taken to settle the dis-
pute.
    3. What was the standing of the men who made
the trouble?
    4. What effect was their teaching having?
    5. Did Paul regard circumcision as a sin? Acts
16: 1-3; I Cor. 7:19; Gal. 5:6; 6:15.
   6. Then why did he so strenuously oppose the
teaching of those men? Acts 15:2, 5; Gal. 2 : 5.
  NOTE.—It was circumcision as a condition of salvation
that Paul objected 10. For the simple act itself he cared
nothing one way or the other. Circumcision was a sign
of righteousness. Rom. 4:11. But there can be no-real
righteousness except that which comes by faith. See
Rom. 9:3o-32; 10:1-4, 1o; Phil. 3:9; Heb.        6; Rom.
84:23; John 6 :29. Therefore the man who had no faith
had no righteousness, and consequently his circumcision
was a sham. The sign of circumcision was given to
Abraham, not to make him righteous,—not as a condition
28             LESSONS FROM THE ACTS.

of salvation,—but as a sign of the righteousness which he
already had by faith, as a token of the saved condition in
which he already was. The Jews who broke the law
were uncircumcised, while the Galatians who, through
faith, kept the law, were circumcised. See Rom. 2: 25-
29; Phil. 3: 22 3; Acts 7:51-53. To say to the disciples,
"You must be circumcised—or you cannot be saved,"
was to teach them that they must trust in the law for
righteousness, and that was to say that Christ had died in
vain.

   7. What was that really saying of the sacrifice
of Christ? Gal. 2: 2 1.
   NOTE.—When the false brethren said to the disciples,
" Except ye be circumcised ye cannot be saved," they
were teaching them that their faith in Christ was not suf-
ficient for salvation. That same teaching is common
even to this day. Many who profess faith in Christ still
say, "It is all right to believe in Christ, but that alone
will not save you; you must keep the commandments,
too," Let us see what this really means. It is a fact
that faith in Christ brings him into the heart and life.
Eph. 3:17; Gal. 2:20. Therefore when one says that in
addition to believing on Christ we must keep the com-
mandments, he virtually says that Christ's life is not in
harmony with God's law. He really, although uncon-
sciously, accuses Christ of sin. It is a dangerous position
for one to take to presume to add to God's word, which
says that men are saved by faith, and that Christians are
wholly the workmanship of God. Eph. 2:8-1o. Faith
works by love, and love is the fulfilling of the law; there-
fore he who has faith in Christ keeps the.law of God; he
walks even as Christ walked, for it is by Christ's obedi-
ence that he is made righteous. Rom. 5:19. " Whatso-
              LESSONS FROM THE ACTS.                   29
ever is not of faith is sin." But he who thinks that he
must keep the law in addition to faith in Christ, thereby
shows that he does not have faith in Christ's righteous-
ness. The obedience which he proposes to add to his
faith is the obedience that comes form self-righteousness,
or sin. But sin is bondage. Rom. 7:14. Therefore the
teaching of false brethren was leading souls into bondage
—putting a grievous yoke upon them.

  _ 8. When only is circumcision profitable? Rom.
2:25.
    9. What is real circumcision? Rom. 2:29;
Phil. 3: 3.
   10. Of what was circumcision a sign?.' Rom. 2:
25-27; 4: rt.
    1. Where must righteousness be to be of any
value? Deut. 6: 4-6; Ps. 51:6.
   12. Who only can put righteousness in the heart?
Jer. 31:33.
   13. Then from whom alone must true circum-
cision come? Deut. 3o:6; Col. 2: I I.
   14. 01 what could circumcision in the flesh only,
performed by man, be the sign?—Of the righteous-
ness of the flesh.
   15. What is the righteousness of the flesh?
Rom. 8:5-8; Gal. 5:19-21.
   16. Therefore what is done for men when they
are led to trust in circumcision, or works of obedi-
ence, for salvation? Acts 15:1o. It is to lead
them to rest securely in sin. See Rev. 3 : 17.
30             LFSSO_VS FROM THE ACTS.

  17. Was the service which God required of his
people grievous or burdensome? i John 5:3; I
Kings 8:62-66; Ps. 116:16, 17.
  18. Who only are in bondage? John 8 :34;
Rom. 7:14.
19. As the Jews had perverted the religion of the
Lord, what did their zeal for the law result in?
,Matt. 15:3, 8, 9; Rom. 2:23, 24; Luke 11:46.

   NOTE. -It should not be forgotten that "the Jews' re-
ligion" (Gal. 1:13, 14) was vastly different from the relig-
ion of God, as given through Moses. It consisted of
traditions. Those traditions were the invention of the
" fathers " (not Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob) to insure that
the law should not be broken. Trusting for salvation
only in the law, and knowing that the law required perfect
obedience in every detail, they naturally set themselves
to find out the utmost details of the law. So they kept
adding burdensome ceremony to burdensome ceremony
until it took a lifetime even to know what the traditions
were. But all this was to no purpose, for their fine-spun
traditions concerning the law were only the product of
their own sinful minds; their most scrupulous service was
only the service of the flesh, without the Spirit of God,
and hence was sin. Thus they made void the law of God
by their traditions. While trusting in the law, they broke
the law. From all such slavish services Christ delivers
us. See Rom. 7:6. He gives rest to the heavy laden,
and makes the soul free indeed.
   20. What does Christ give? Matt. 11:28; John
8 : 36; Rom. 8 : 2.

   THE QUESTION SETTLED.—ACTS xs:
                (MEMORY VERSE, ACTS 5:1z.)
  GOLDEN TEXT.—"Prove all things; hold fast that which is good."
Thess. 5: 2z.

   I. Tell what led to the conference in Jerusalem.
   2. What was the importance of the question?
   3. Give Peter's argument in the case.
   4. When Peter had finished, what did Barnabas
and Paul tell? Acts 15:12.
   5. Who spoke next? Verse 13.
   6. To what did he refer? Verse 14.
   7. To whom did he refer as authority for their
preaching to the Gentiles? Verse 15.
   8. What prophecy did he specify? Verses 16,
17; Amos 9:it, 12.
   9. How long had God had it upon his mind to
save the Gentiles? Acts 15:14.
  NOTE.—The facts concerning the Gentiles were argu-
ments that could not be overcome. God had abundantly
blessed the labor that had been done among them, as
shown by Peter and Paul and Barnabas. This showed
that God was not only willing to save the Gentiles, but
that he would save them by simple faith. When God
poured out his Spirit upon them, so that they spoke with
tongues, no one who reverenced the Lord could say that
there was something still lacking that the Gentiles must
do before they could be saved. That the salvation of the
Gentiles was not a new thing in God's plan is shown by

                                                  - —
the promises to Abraham, by the prophecy of Amos,
which James quoted, by Joel 2:28, by Isa. 45 22,23; 49:
6; 6o:1-5, etc.

   10. What, therefore, was James' decision in the
case? Acts 15:19. •
    t. *hat did he suggest that they should write
to the Gentile converts? Verse 20.
   NOTE.—The four things specified in the letter to the
brethren are declared by the Spirit to be "necessary
things." They are as necessary now as they were when
written, and had been necessary from the beginning.
The blood is the life (Gen. 9:4, 5), and therefore the pro-
hibition against it comes under the sixth commandment.
The prohibition against things strangled comes in the same
list. The relation of the other things to the law of God
is obvious. These things, being forbidden by the law of
God, are consequently inconsistent with the life of Christ,
for his life is the law in its perfection.

   12. Why was it not necessary to specify more
particularly the things that pertain to the Christian
life? Verse 2 I .
   NOTE. —It should be understood that the apostles did
not lay these four necessary things upon the disciples in
addition to their faith in Christ. These things were spec-
ified only because they were things that people from
among the heathen would not so readily perceive as
necessarily embraced in the Christian life. Fornication
was among the heathen a commonplace affair, and even
required by their religion. The eating of blood was a
common thing. Everything in ordinary life.was so im-
               LESSONS FROM THE ACTS.                     33

mediately connected with idolatry that it was necessary
for the converts from among the heathen to be especially
on their guard to avoid pollution of idols. These things, in
which the Gentile converts might sin without realizing it,
so common were they, were especially noted, but it was
necessary for the apostles to go further into particulars
concerning the Christian life, for the disciples had con-
stant access to the writings of Moses, in which the Chris-
tian life is set forth, for he wrote of Christ. John 5:46,47.
  13. Why was it necessary to specify even these?
   NOTE.—One point may be referred to as showing that,
in setting forth the law, Moses was describing Christ,
through whom alone the righteousness of the law is fulfilled.
In Deut. 3o:11-14 Moses, after having set forth the law,
says: "For this commandment which I command thee
this day, it is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off.
It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go
up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may
hear it, and do it? Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou
shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring
it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? But the word
is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart,
that thou mayest do it." But in Rom. to:5-9 Paul tells
us that this refers to Christ. This was not left obscure
by Moses, so that the Jews would think that the com-
mandment must be kept by them apart from Christ, for
just before the verses quoted Moses tells them that God
 would circumcise their heart to keep his law (Deut. 3o:6,
8), and just afterward he said, "That thou mayest love
 the Lord thy God, and that thou mayest obey his voice,
 and that thou mayest cleave unto him; for he is thy life,
 and the length of thy days." Deut. 3o: zo.

  14. Were these things ci" minor importance?.
Verses 28, 29.
  15. Are these things to be observed in these
days as well as theA .
  16. What steps did the brethren,fake to relieve
the minds of the new converts who had been
troubled? Verses 22, 23.
  17. What commendation was given to Barnabas
and Paul? Verses 25, 26.
  18. What did the apostles agree was evidently
the work of Barnabas and Paul? .Gal. 2: 7-9.
  19. How was the result of the conference received
by the brethren at Antioch? Acts 15:3o, 31.

   NOTA BENE.—The teacher and scholar will please note
that there are fourteen Sabbaths in this quarter and but
thirteen lessons. But as there are but twelve Sabbaths
next quarter, and thirteen lessons will be provided, it has
been thought best to, have the lesson of December 31
counted as the first lesson of the first quarter of 1893.
This will not disarrange our schools or record books, and
is the easiest way to dispose of this transient irregular-
ity.—EDITOR B. S. L.
