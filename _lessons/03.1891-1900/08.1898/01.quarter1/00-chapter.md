in thine heart; and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children,
and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when
thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou
risest up." Deut. 6 : 6, 7.

Sabbath-school lesson with your children."—Mrs. E. G. While.



 PROGRAM FOR FAMILY STUDY OF THE S. S. LESSONS.
    SABBATH.—(After church services or at the close of the
Sabbath.) Read carefully the lesson for the next Sabbath,
and assign verses to be memorized during the week.
    SUNDAY.—Name the persons and places mentioned in
the lesson, and locate the places on the map. Pronounce and
define the hard words.
    MONDAY. —Let each tell what he can of the lesson, and
then read it over, carefully noting the points which were not
remembered.
    TUESDAY.—Repeat verses already committed to mem-
ory. Read the " Spirit of Prophecy" on the lesson, or study
the lesson from the Instructor or Little Friend.
     WEDNESDAY.—Let each give a synopsis of the lesson,
or tell the lesson story. Look up the ancient manners and cus-
toms referred 10.
     THURSDAY.—Name again the persons mentioned, and
tell what each said or did. Give time and place of each event.
     FRIDAY.—Ask the questions from the lesson book, study
the notes, and repeat the memory verses.
     SABBATH.—Let each repeat as much of the lesson scrip- •
 ture as possible. Give each one the privilege of questioning
 others upon the lesson. Relate personal experiences in which
 the truths of the lesson have been helpful.


   (This program is simply suggestive and can of course be varied
to suit circumstances, but we do urge upon all the necessity of daily,
systematic study of the scriptures covered by the Sabbath-school les-
sons.)

   SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS AND PUPILS.

                 TO BE READ BY ALL.

   STUDY the text thoroughly. Although the lessons
may seem long when considered in relation to the half
hour allowed to them in the Sabbath-school, they are
really very short when considered in relation to the entire
week, which may be devoted to the study of each one.
It should be a comparatively light task for anybody to
become thoroughly familiar with the book of Acts in an
entire year. At the close of that time, every one who
has followed the lessons through, ought to be able to
                                               (3)
4               ACTS OF THE APOSTLES.

locate off-hand any passage or incident, or to give the
main features of any chapter. Each one who conscien-
tiously works to this end, will find that the entering of
the Word gives light.
   To avoid confusion, it is best in general to get the text
of the lesson well in mind before launching out to other
scriptures. It is the book of Acts we are studying, and
this should be studied and learned first of all. Then it
will furnish a good nucleus around which to gather other
portions of scripture. One portion well fixed in mind,
will help to hold many others.
   Don't confine yourself to the questions given, only let
all your questions be directly on the text. These ques-
tions are suggestive, and not by any means exhaustive.
He who can dispense with the lesson book entirely, and
question directly from the Bible, does the best work; but
let him not fail to stick to the Bible. Ask questions on
the text, and only such as can be answered by the text of
the lesson, or by some parallel scripthre.

      ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS.

   I. PREJUDICE and opposition usually have the effect
of discouraging workers, or at least of causing them to
think that the field is not a profitable one to remain in;
what was the effect on the apostles? Note verses 2, 3.
"The unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made
their minds evil affected towards the brethren. Long
time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord."
   2. Note especially the influence of the preaching as in-
dicated in verse 4. It was not for nothing that the
apostles abode in Iconium a long time, in spite of, or,
rather, because of, the prejudice. They remained until
all in the city had taken their stand either for or against
the truth. Can the "multitude of the, city" mean any
less than all in the city? Does the statement that "the
multitude of the city was divided, a part held with the
Jews, and a part with the apostles," give any indication
of the proportion of believers in the city?

in Asia." As a matter of fact they were in Asia all the
time, that is, they were in the continent of Asia; but as

as Asia Minor—the extreme western part of the conti-
nent. In Biblical maps this portion of the country is
designated as Asia.

  3. Compare Acts 17: 14, 15 with i Thess. 2:17, 18;
3: 1-6. From this it will be seen that Paul desired to
go back to Thessalonica, and that such was his interest
for the brethren in that place, that, much as he needed
the help and company of Timothy, he sent him back, to
Thessalonica, and he remained for a time in Athens alone.

22              ACTS OF THE APOSTLES.

 other translations have it, "very religious," or "greatly
devoted to the worship of the gods." While it is
true that all heathen worship is superstitious, we may
he sure that the apostle Paul did not begin his discourse
with words calculated to arouse the anger of his hearers,
and so we may know that the words did not convey to
their minds the same idea as the expression, "Ye are in all
things too superstitious," does to ours. The statement,
"Ye are very religious," was the truth, and naturally
opened the way for what followed.
   2. " If haply they might feel after Him and find Him."
Notice exactly what is said here. Is the doubt implied
as to whether men would find the Lord, or as to whether
they would- feel after Him? If men feel after the Lord, is
there any question as to the certainty of their finding
Him? What makes it more than sure that they who
seek the Lord will find Him? Isa. 65 :
   3. "The times of this ignorance God winked at."
The Revised Version and some others have it, "over-
looked," which is an exactly literal rendering of the
Greek. Several translations have it "bore with," which
also expresses the sense. Compare Acts i4: 16 and
Heb. 5 : 2.

     ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS.
  I. "AND when they opposed themselves." The
student must not make the mistake of playing upon
the words "opposed themselves," as is sometimes done
in the case of 2 Tim. 2: 25, and saying that the writer
means to teach that those who oppose the truth oppose
themselves. The single Greek word from which the
words "oppose themselves" are rendered, will by no
means bear such_n ,,,,,Qtruction as is often put upon
these words. It!ans simply, " set themselves in
opposition." A Arence to Rom. 13: 2 ; James 4:6;
5:6, and i Peter 5:5, where the same Greek word is
rendered, "resist," "resisteth," will show that it could
not possibly be used in the sense of making opposition
to one's self.

   2. Gallio, deputy of Achaia, was brother of the phi-
losopher Seneca, the tutor of the emperor Nero.
  3. Verse 22. Paul landed at Csarea, and "went up
and saluted the church." Although Jerusalem is not
mentioned, it is generally accepted that the "going up"
was to that city. The expression is literally correct, as
applied to a journey from Caesarea to Jerusalem.

      ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS.

   " WE have not so much as heard whether there
be any Holy Ghost." What had John proclaimed in
his preaching? Matt. 3: 11. Could these twelve men,
then, ever have seen or heard John the Baptist? Could
they have been at all acquainted with John's teaching?
Had they, judging from Acts 19:4, 5, even heard any-
thing about Christ? In whom, then, had they been
blindly believing?
   " 'Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed?'
The two verbs are in the aorist tense, and therefore de-
note instantaneous acts. The Authorized Version there-
fore gives an entirely wrong idea, as there is no question
about what happened after believing ; but the question
relates to what occurred when they believed. Hence
(Revised Version) rightly, Did ye receive the Holy
Ghost when ye believed? 'We have not heard.' Also
the aorist. We did not hear, referring back to the time
of their beginning. 'Whether there be any Holy
Ghost.' But, as Bengel observes, 'They could not have
followed either Moses or John the Baptist without having
heard of the Holy Ghost.' The words, therefore, are to
be explained, not of their being unaware of the existence
of the Holy Ghost, but of his presence and baptism on
earth.. The word estin, there be, is to be taken in the
sense of be present, or be given, as in John 7:39, where
it is said, 'The Holy Ghost was not yet (onpo in),' and
where the translators rightly render, 'was not yet given.' "

   I. THE town clerk was undoubtedly a heathen; yet
see how he had grasped the principle that truth can
defend itself. Compare the words of Joash, the father of
Gideon. Judges 6 : 28-31.
   2. Note that this great tumult, which but for the
prudent management of the town clerk, might have re-
sulted in a wholesale persecution and massacre of the
Christians, was wholly a business matter. The silver-
smiths' devotion to the goddess Diana was wholly a
question of profit: from the worship of Diana they got
their living. Their opposition to Paul was solely on
account of the fact that the spread of Christianity inter-
fered with their business. Even so in the days of Trajan,
the persecution that was raised against the Christians,

concerning which Pliny wrote to the emperor, was due

Paul was anxious to get to Jerusalem; having been
hindered by the slowness of the vessel from spending
the Sabbath that he had designed to with the church
at Troas, he waited there seven days, so that he could
spend one Sabbath with them; yet in order to lose no
more time than was absolutely necessary, he sent his
traveling companions on with the boat as soon as the
Sabbath was past, while he himself remained to hold
one last meeting, knowing that he could overtake the
others by a shorter route the next morning on foot.
