the truths of the lesson have been helpful.



   (This program is simply suggestive and can of course be varied
to suit circumstances, but we do urge upon all the necessity of daily,
systematic study of the scriptures covered by the Sabbath-school les-
sons.)

                           FROM THE



BOOK OF GENESIS

                          PREFACE.
    THE book of Genesis is a sacred history, and a divine
revelation of the "beginning of things." It makes known
man's high origin as the offspring of God in creation. Com-
pared with secular history, it is indeed prehistoric, and in the
positive truthfulness of its statements it antedates the discovery,
and puts to shame the assumptions, of geological science.
Speaking of the record of creation, Weidner well says, " We
have a plain, simple account of the works of God, and though
it is deep and beyond our comprehension, nevertheless, from
this first page of the Bible a child may learn more in an hour
than all the philosophers of the world were able to discover
without it in four thousand years." It is the book of the Bible,
adapted alike to the study of old and young. Its history,
description, and biography fascinate the children, while its
divine philosophy and grand summaries of the infinite thought
captivate, astonish, and confound even the noblest soul of the
most intellectual man. That it is inspired, and that it was
written by Moses, is here taken for granted.
     In studying this series of lessons the following order is
thought by the writer to be best: (a) Read carefully the verses
in Genesis several times. (b) Question every thought individ-
ually, and in its connections with other portions of the lesson.
(c) Read and answer the questions on the text in the lesson
                                                      (3)

pamphlet. (d) Outline the lesson on paper. (e) Ask and
answer questions from your outline. (f) Fix your outline in
memory, and recite the lesson mentally from it. (g) Look over
the questions for "additional study," and trace out those lines of
thought in which you may be especially interested. (h.) Critically
read the notes. (i) Set apart a definite time during the week
for reading the articles referred to in "Patriarchs and Prophets,"
etc. (j) Be sure to review mentally every week, the previous
lessons from the outlines you have already made and learned.
(k) Study to know the truth and to obey it, remembering that
"if any man willeth to do His will, he shall know of the teach-
ing." Those who have courage enough to follow the above
plan will not fail to receive much good from the study of the
book of Genesis.

scription edition.

                              NOTES.
    I. The first verse of the Bible reveals God as Creator; the last,
as Redeemer; and both, like every verse between the two, re-
veal Him as He is, a God of love. To fallen man the Gospel in
creation becomes the Gospel of salvation. But lost man may not
see God in the book of nature either as Creator or as Redeemer;
therefore, God in His mercy and love has given him the book
of Revelation. But even here man sees only in part. In Gen.
I : I are revealed the deep things of God in mysteries. "In the
beginning"—who can tell just when?—" God "—who can find
Him out unto perfection?-" created "—who can explain the
secret of the process?—"the heaven and the earth "—who has
comprehended their range or their glory? But this is the Chris-
tian's God. "God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all; "
and yet "clouds and darkness are round about Him." By
hiding He reveals Himself. His works and His manner of
working are mysteries. He has robed all nature in garments
which man can not fully rend: "-Lo, these are but the outskirts
of His ways ; and how small a whisper do we hear of Him! but
the thunder of His power who can understand?" Job 26 : 14,
 R. V. In this connection read " God in Nature," by Mrs.
 E. G. White, as recorded in General Conference Bullelin for
                   IN CHI MOST NAEDY FIELDS
6                      BOOK OF GENESIS.

1897, No. 5, PP. 73, 74; or in "Special Testimonies on Educa-
tion," pp. 56-62.
    2. It is not beyond the power of faith to see that when He
who is the light of the whole universe, in whom there is no
darkness at all, who dwelleth in the light unapproachable, and
in whose presence the sun is ashamed, was present, and said,
"Let there be light, and there was light," that it should exist
even before the sun was made on the fourth day. It is not hard
for the child of trust to believe that He who now uses the sun
to cause the " grass to grow for the cattle and herb for the service
of man," should by His own light cause the grass, herbs, and
trees to spring forth in a single day, carpeting the whole earth
with living green, lofty trees and magnificent flowers.
    3. The infinite power of Him who upholds all the number-
less worlds in limitless space, may not be called in question by
finite man. To the Christian it is not a thing incredible that
God should make this world and our solar system in just six
days of twenty-four hours each, and in just the order named in
the Mosaic record. On the contrary, it is just what we would
expect of Him, that He should do a definite work in a definite
time. For " He taketh up the isles as a very little thing," and
the nations are to Him "as the small dust of the balance." It
is in perfect harmony with His manner of working when upon
the earth, in the healing of diseases and in the performance of
the miracles of bread and wine, and of stilling the waves of
the sea. It is just what we would expect of Him who takes
note of the fall of the sparrow as well as the fall of the world.
Our earth, compared with the universe of worlds, is, as it were,
but a grain of sand upon the seashore. God has not revealed
to us the process of creation further than that " He spake, and
it was ; He commanded, and it stood fast ;" and this is enough
so that by faith we may understand.
    4. The expression "the stars also," calls attention to the
fact that God made the stars as well as the sun and the moon.
The names of the planets which revolve around our sun, in the
order of their distances from it, are Mercury, Venus, Earth,
Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

                             NOTES.
    1. The word, "after his kind," in verses it, 12, 24, and 25,
refer to the different species of plants and animals, showing that
there was order in the work of creation. There could be no
more simple, accurate, general, and therefore scientific classifi-
cation of plants and animals than that given in these verses.
Scientific facts are always in harmony with the record of Inspi-
ration. The Word of God deals only with facts,—truth and its
underlying principles. Its language is always positive. It does
not giveexpression to opinions or theories or hypotheses, as do
the words of men. The story of nature since the fall is not a
perfect story of creation. The curse rests upon the face of
nature and upon man ; and he who, independent of divine
revelation, undertakes to account for creation, falls into various
absurd theories of the evolution of man, or hypotheses as to the
origin of the world. The Bible is the most scientific book ever
written ; for it contains truths, facts, and principles which,
when sought for by the r _ le enlightenment of the Holy Spirit,
will guide into all truth. This is the science of salvation, which
is the science of sciences.
    2. "Let Us make man in Our image," indicates a consultation
of the Father with the Son, and shows that both alike were
engaged in the work of creation. The fact tha,man was made
in the image of God, constituted him the rightful ruler of the
world, under God, so long as he retained that image.
    3. When the pure eye of God looked down upon His handi-
work at the beginning of the seventh day, it beheld the earth

full of His riches (Ps. 104 : 24), full of His goodness (Ps. 33:5),
full of His knowledge (Isa. 11:9), man upright, in His own
image, the face of nature reflecting the light of His own counte-
nance, so that "the earth shined with His glory" (Eze. 43 : 2);
and then He whose glory is above the earth and the heavens
(Ps. 148: 13; 8: 1), exclaimed, "Exceeding good." And then
it was that "the morning stars sang together, and all the sons
of God shouted for joy " (Job 38:7) ; and Adam and Eve,
enlivened by that shout, enraptured by that song, and encircled
by that glory, could but cry out in the fulness of their souls,
" Great and marvelous are Thy works, Lord God Almighty"
(Rev. 15:3); "Whom have I in heaven but Thee? and there is
none upon earth that I desire beside Thee" (Ps. 73: 25) Thus
was given to Adam and Eve an example of how they should
observe every Sabbath day from that time on throughout the
ceaseless ages of eternity, to the praise, honor, and glory of
Him whose right it is to reign. There is no subject of study
which so arouses all the energies of the being as that of creation
and redemption. He who with the simple trust of a little child
accepts the record of creation as given in the first chapter of
Genesis, will even now in this age of infidelity and atheism,
believe every word of the Book of books.
    4. "The world before the flood reasoned that for centuries
the laws of nature had been fixed. The recurring seasons had
come in their order. Heretofore rain had never fallen ; the
earth had been watered by a mist or dew."—Patriarchs and

                            NOTES.
    1. In verse 7 is the inspired record of the origin of man. He
was formed out of the dust of the ground, and then by the breath
of God became a living soul. For continued existence Adam
and Eve were dependent upon the tree of life (Gen. 3 : 22); so,
being probationers in Eden (Gen. 2 : 17), they were not immor-
tal even than, much less since that time. Man is now wholly
mortal. " Dying thou shalt die, " refers to the whole man.
    2. " The Lord knew that Adam could not be happy without
labor; therefore, He gave him the pleasant employment of dress-
ing the garden. And, as he tended the things of beauty and
usefulness around him, he could behold the goodness and glory
of God in His created works. Adam had themes for contem-
plation in the works of God in Eden, which was heaven in
miniature. God did not form man merely to contemplate His
glorious works; therefore, He gave him hands for labor, as well
as a mind and heart for contemplation. If the happiness of man
consisted in doing nothing, the Creator would not have given
Adam his appointed work. Man was to find happiness in labor
as well as in meditation. Adam could take in the grand idea
that he was created in the image of God, to be like Him in
righteousness and holiness. His mind was capable of con-
tinual cultivation, expansion, refinement, and noble elevation;
for God was his teacher and angels were his companions."—
 Redemption, E. G. W., pp. 7,8.
    3. God Himself gave Adam a companion. He provided
an `helpmeet for him, —a helper corresponding to him,—one
                  IN THE MOST NEEDY FIELDS
12                     BOOK OF GENESIS.

 who was fitted to be his companion, and who could be one
 with him in love and sympathy. Eve was created from a rib
taken from the side of Adam, signifying that she was not to
control him, as the head, nor to be trampled under his feet as
an inferior, but to stand by his side as an equal, to be loved and
protected by him. A part of man, bone of his bone, and flesh
of his flesh, she was his second self; showing the close union
and the affectionate attachment that should exist in this rela-
tion."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 46.
   4. Adam and Eve being made "in the image of God," and
" but little lower than the angels," the glory of God must have
shined forth from them as from no other portion of His creation
on the earth. They "were draped in light, as were the
heavenly angels."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 1, p. 4r. "The
robe of light which had enshrouded them, now disappeared."
—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 57. This chapter shows that
Adam and Eve talked with God in Eden. " The pure in heart
live as in the visible presence of God during the time He
apportions them in this world. And they will also see God face
to face in the future immortal state, as did Adam when he
walked and talked with God in Eden."—Mount of Blessing,
P. 43.

                             NOTES.

    I. God, knowing all things, did not consult with Adam
and Eve with reference to the laying of the plan of salvation;
but even before announcing to them their punishment, He
lovingly pointed them forward to the Life-giver, to the "Lamb
of God which taketh away the sin of the world." In this
promise, the "enmity," is contained the whole plan of salvation,
and that mighty struggle between the powers of light and dark-
ness which will finally result in the utter destruction of sinners
and Satan, of sin and death.
    " When the Lord Jesus visited our earth, He brought with
Him renovating energy. He put enmity between the seed of
the woman and the serpent. But there is no enmity between
fallen angels and fallen men. Both, through apostasy, are evil;
and wherever there is evil, with no disposition to repent, it will
always league with Satan against God."—Review, Jan. 26, 1897.
    "God declares, ' I will put enmity.' This enmity is not
naturally entertained. When man transgressed the divine law,
his nature became evil, and he was in harmony and not at
variance with Satan. There exists naturally no enmity between
sinful man and the originator of sin. Both became evil
through apostasy. . . . It is the grace that Christ implants
in the soul which creates in man enmity against Satan. With-
out this converting grace and renewing power, man would con-

tinue the captive of Satan, a servant ever ready to do his bidding.
But the new principle in the soul creates conflict where hitherto
had been peace. The power which Christ imparts, enables
man to resist the tyrant and usurper. Whoever is seen to abhor
sin instead of loving it, whoever resists and conquers those
passions that have held sway within, displays the operation of a
principle wholly from above."—Great Controversy, pp. 505,
506. God's love in the heart constrains the righteous, but, not
being in the hearts of the wicked, it only restrains them.
   2. " The halo of glory, which God had given to holy Adam
to cover him as a garment, departed from him after his trans-
gression. The light of God's glory could not cover diso-
bedience and sin." When the plan of salvation had been
announced to Adam and Eve, God made them coats of skins,
in order to turn their minds back to Christ, through whom
only they could be clothed with the robes of His righteousness.

   "Patriarchs and Prophets," pp. 71-79.
                             NOTES.
    I. "Cain and Abel represent two classes that will exist in
the world till the close of time. One class avail themselves of
the appointed sacrifice for sin ; the other venture to depend
upon their own merits ; theirs is a sacrifice without the virtue
of divine mediation, and thus it is not able to bring man into
favor with God. It is only through the merits of Jesus that our
transgressions can be pardoned. Those who feel no need of
the blood of Christ, who feel that without divine grace they can,
by their own works, secure the approval of God, are making
the same mistake as did Cain. If they do not accept the cleans-
ing blood, they are under condemnation. There is no other
provision made whereby they can be released from the thral-
dom of sin.
    "The class of worshipers who follow the example of Cain
includes by far the greater portion of the world ; for nearly every
false religion has been based on the same principle,--that man
can depend upon his own efforts for salvation. It is claimed by
some that the human race is in need, not of redemption, but of
development,—that it can refine, elevate, and regenerate itself.
As Cain thought to secure the divine favor by an offering that
lacked the blood of a sacrifice, so do these expect to exalt
humanity to the divine standard, independent of the atonement.
The history of Cain shows what must be the result. It shows
what man will become, apart from Christ. Humanity has no
power to regenerate itself. It does not tend upward, toward
the divine, but downward, toward the Satanic. Christ is our
only hope. 'There is none other name under heaven given
among men, whereby we must be saved.' Neither is there
salvation in any other.' "—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 72, 73.

How easily the temper of the disobedient toward God is stirred
when his plans do not carry, and he is disappointed in his
expectations !
  "The Lord saw the wrath of Cain ; He saw the falling of his
countenance. Thus is revealed how closely the Lord marks
man's every action, all his intents and purposes, yes, even to
the expressions of his countenance. This, though man may
say nothing, expresses his refusal to do the way and will
of God.
   "Mark the words of the Lord. 'And the Lord said unto
Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?'
These questions may be addressed to every one who, like Cain,
reveals his passion because he is not commended by others
when acting out the promptings of Satan, and which are in
direct opposition to the requirements of God."

hermit, shutting himself entirely from the world •, for he had a
work to do for God in the world. In the family and in his
intercourse with men, as a husband and father, a friend, a citi-
zen, he was the steadfast, unwavering servant of the Lord.
    "His heart was in harmony with God's will; for 'can two
walk together, except they be agreed?' And this holy walk was
continued for three hundred years. There are few Christians
who would not be far more earnest and devoted if they knew
that they had but a short time to live, or that the coming of
Christ was about to take place. But Enoch's faith waxed
the stronger, his love became more ardent, with the lapse of
centuries.
    "Enoch was a man of strong and highly cultivated mind,
and extensive knowledge ; he was honored with special revela-
tions from God ; yet being in constant communion with Heaven,
with a sense of the divine greatness and perfection ever before
him, he was one of the humblest of men. The closer the con-
nection with God, the deeper was the sense of his own weak-
ness and imperfection."—Patriarchs and Prophets, ft. 85.
    2. "They [the antediluvians] possessed great physical and
 mental strength, and their advantages for acquiring both
religious and scientific knowledge were unrivaled. It is a mis-
take to suppose that because they lived to a great age their
mind.-; matured late ; their mental powers were early developed,
and those who cherished the fear of God and lived in harmony
with His will, continued to increase in knowledge and wisdom
throughout their life. Could illustrious scholars of our time be
placed in contrast with men of the same age who lived before
the flood, they would appear as greatly inferior in mental as in
physical strength."
    "Adam had learned from the Creator the history of creation ;
he himself witnessed the events of nine centuries; and he im-
parted his knowledge to his descendants. The antediluvians
were without books, they had no written records; but with
their great physical and mental vigor, they had strong memories,
able to grasp and to retain that which was communicated to
them, and in turn to transmit it unimpaired to their posterity.
And for hundreds of years there were nine generations living
upon the earth contemporaneously, having the opportunity of
consulting together and profiting each by the knowledge and
experience of all."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 82,83. Note
that Adam lived with Methuselah, Noah's grandfather, 243
years; with Lamech, Noah's father, 56 years; with Enoch, 308
years; and that Methuselah lived until the year of the flood.
Thus the antediluvians not only had the indisputable evidence
of the garden, with its cherubim-guarded gates, but the personal

is definite and divine as prophecy. It is the only authentic

its expression of the infinite thought of God towards man in the
gospel of creation and redemption.
    The flood of waters reveals to us the present state of the

    " If God's revealed will is so difficult to be understood,
certainly men should not rest their faith upon mere supposi-
tions in regard to that which He has not revealed. God's
ways are not our ways, neither are His thoughts our thoughts.
Human science can never account for his wondrous works.
God so ordered that men, beasts, and trees, many times
larger than those now upon the earth, and other things, should
be buried in the earth at the time of the flood, and there be
preserved to evidence to man that the inhabitants of the old
world perished by a flood. God designed that the discovery
of these things in the earth should establish the faith of men
in inspired history."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. r, p. go.

    1. " The flesh of dead animals was not the original food for
man. Man was permitted to eat it after the flood, because all
vegetation had been destroyed. . . . Since the flood the
human race has been shortening the period of its existence.
Physical, mental, and moral degeneracy is rapidly increasing
in these last days."—Mrs. E. G. W.
    2. " His [God's] love is the glory of the rainbow encircling
the throne on high. . . . In the rainbow above the throne
is the everlasting testimony that ' God so loved the world, that
He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in
Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.' . . . Point
to the throne, arched with the rainbow of promise, the righteous-
ness of Christ. As the bow in the cloud is formed by the union
of the sunlight and the shower, so the rainbow encircling the
throne represents the combined power of mercy and justice.
It is not justice alone that is to be maintained ; for this would
eclipse the glory, of the rainbow of promise above the throne ;
men could see only the penalty of the law. Were there no
 justice, no penalty, there would be no stability to the govern-
ment of God."—Mrs. E. G. W, in Review, 1892, No. 49. See

   1. From Ex. 12 : 40 we learn that the children of Israel
sojourned 43o years. From the time that Jacob went into
Egypt until the day that the children of Israel left there was 215
years, so that the sojourn in the land of Canaan after Abram
came out of Ur of the Chaldees was 215 years.
   2. The covenant of promise, the Adamic, the Abrahamic, the
new covenant, is the covenant of grace which was made with
Adam, with Noah, with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, with David,
with all the holy men of old, and finally with all the children of

faith, who become heirs and joint heirs with Christ of the
promised possession through the blood of that same everlasting
covenant. God, His character, His law, His government is
perfect ; and this necessitates perfect obedience on the part of
all His subjects. This, however, fallen man in and of himself
alone could not render; therefbre, before God demanded it of
Adam, of Abraham, or of any of their seed, He made known to
them the source of their power. He prefaced His requirements
with, " I am the Almighty God." Abraham understood what
this meant, "because," as He, the Lord, said, "Abraham
obeyed My voice and kept My charge, My commandments, My
statutes, and My laws." This power is brought to us as a gift
by grace in ancrthrough Christ Jesus, the perfect Sacrifice. To
Him was given all power in heaven and on earth; and when He
came He is represented as being "full of grace and truth ; "
" and of His fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.
For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by
Jesus Christ." "The wages of sin is death," but "where sin
abounded, grace did much more abound." "By grace are ye
saved through faith ; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of
God." When Christ came to seek and save that which was
lost, He left His glory with His Father; He came in the like-
ness of sinful flesh, bearing the sins of many, that while in the
flesh we might go from grace to grace; when made perfect, like
Him, through sufferings, we might be glorified together; after
which it will be no longer from grace to grace but from glory
to glory. The everlasting covenant, then, is the covenant of
grace, of peace, of and unto perfection, unto salvation, unto
glory.

at each succeeding time until Abraham saw the promise to be

ing," pp. 55-66.
                             NOTE.
     The salvation which comes to this world through grace is
by that faith which works through the love of God, and is man-
ifested in Christ, through the Holy Spirit, through the angels,
in those who are represented in the sermon on the mount as
being "the salt of the earth," "the light of the world." All
the power is of God. Christ said, " For their sakes I sanctify
Myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth."
God blessed faithful Abraham, as He does every child of faith,
that he might be a blessing to others. This can be accomplished
only by the vitalizing power and influence of the Holy Spirit,
represented by the golden oil flowing through the golden tubes
into the golden bowl—by the grace, love, and righteousness of
Christ brought to others by the personal contact and association
of the Christian with them. For the sake of the righteous, the
Lord preserves the world ; and as soon as they are taken out of
it, the world will be destroyed. " Were it not for the few right-
eous who inhabit the earth, the wrath of God would not be
delayed a moment from punishing the wicked."

                            NOTES.
    1. Abraham had become so accustomed to the voice of
God that he could not mistake it, but stepped out by faith upon
that which could not have been other than mysterious darkness,
and yet found his foot planted upon the Solid Rock, the Sure
Foundation, the Fountain of Faith, in the arm of Him who said,
" I am the Almighty God."
    2. Mount Sinai is Hagar, which gendereth unto bondage;
but Mount Moriah, Mount Calvary, is Isaac, which gives birth
to freedom. This is the "glorious holy mountain," "the
mountain of the Lord; " as it is said, "In the mountain of the
Lord it shall be seen." What?—Jehovah-jireh, "the Lord will
provide." What?—The Lamb. "God will provide Himself a
Lamb for the burnt-offering." What Lamb?—Oh, "the Lamb
slain from the foundation of the world" ! Praise the Lord.
See "Great Controversy," pp. 18, 19. For the distinction be-
tween the covenants see Gal. 4 : 22-31.,
    3. Perfect faith works perfect obedience. God could not
confirm His covenant with an oath until Abraham had fulfilled
this condition explicitly stated in Gen. 17 : I, 2. The original
Hebrew for the word " make" in verse 2 is " give." This
shows that even the covenant, as well as the power to keep it,
was a free gift by grace. Abraham had shown his lack of faith

and obedience in looking to Eleazer as his heir, and in taking
Hagar to be his wife. As a result he was also fearful, as is
shown by his lack of truthfulness before. Pharaoh (Gen 12 : 13),
before Abimelech (Gen. zo : 2), and no doubt in many other
places since leaving Haran (verse 13). This last great close test
came upon Abraham because of these failures. He was tried
to the uttermost, but not above• what he was able to bear in the
strength which had been offered him. The Lord revealed to
him the truthfulness of the statement, " I will also with the
temptation make a way of escape, that ye may be able to bear
it." He also saw that God brings men over the ground again
and again, until perfect humility and transformation of char-
acter bring them into harmony with Christ and the Spirit of
heaven, and they are victors over themselves.

                      ADDITIONAL STUDY.

   1. Read Genesis zo and 21, and note Abraham's relations
with Abimelech, his test of faith and obedience in sending away
Hagar and Ishmael according to Sarah's word.
   2. That the everlasting covenant was made with others than
Abraham see 2 Sam. 23 : 5; Isa. 54: to, etc.
   3. At his birth he was called Isaac, laughter, rejoicing. How
does this illustrate the birth of Christ?
   4. Satan's design in tempting us is our destruction; God's
design is our salvation. Study carefully Heb. II : 17-19.
   5. Name in order, and locate as far as possible, all the
places where Abraham sojourned or pitched his tent since leav-
ing Haran.
   6. Abraham had forsaken home, countrymen, and earthly
friends, had become a pilgrim in a strange land, had been
entirely separated from Lot, had exiled Hagar and Ishmael,
and now was asked to offer up his only-begotten son. Why
was all this? See James 2 :21-23.
    7. How many times did the Lord renew His promise to
Abraham? Note the additional surety in each case.
   8. Draw a careful parallel between Abraham and Isaac's
experiences in this chapter, and that of the Father and Son
before and at Calvary.
