in thine heart; and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children,
and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when
thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou

   SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS AND PUPILS.

                 TO   BE READ BY ALL.
   STUDY the text thoroughly. Although the lessons
may seem long when considered in relation to the half
hour allowed to them in the Sabbath-school, they are
really very short when considered in relation to the entire
week, which may be devoted to the study of each one.
It should be a comparatively light task for anybody to
become thoroughly familiar with the book of Acts in an
entire year. At the close of that time, every one who
has followed the lessons through, ought to be able to
                                               (3)
4               ACTS OF THE APOSTLES.


locate off-hand any passage or incident, or to give the
main features of any chapter. Each one who conscien-
tiously works to this end, will find that the entering of
the Word gives light.
   To avoid confusion, it is best in general to get the text
of the lesson well in mind before launching out to other
scriptures. It is the • book of Acts we are studying, and
this should be studied and learned first of all. Then it
will furnish a good nucleus around which to gather other
portions of scripture. One portion well fixed in mind,
will help to hold many otherS.
   Don't confine yourself to the questions given, only let
all your questions be directly on the text. These ques-
tions are suggestiVe, and not by any means exhaustive.
He who can dispense with the lesson book entirely, and
question directly from the Bible, does the best work;, but
let him not fail to stick to the Bible. Ask questions on
the text, and only such as can be answered by the text of
the lesson, or by some parallel scripture.

in harmony with what was said in that assembly?
   4. Note that although Greek was the common lan-
guage even among the Jews in 'Paul's day, he spoke to
them in Hebrew. Why was this?

       LESSON X11.—June 18, 1898.

                        REVIEW.
                        (Acts 1-14.)

   NOTE.—In the course of the year there have been
many review questions besides the quarterly review, the
object being to keep the mind of the pupil continually on
the tel. We have now covered the entire book of Acts
in fifty lessons, of which three have been review lessons.
Whether the lessons have been well learned or not, all
will find it very profitable to devote the remaining two
weeks of the quarter to review. If the book has not
been thoroughly studied, then the review is especially
necessary; if it has been carefully and thoroughly studied,
then the reviews will be especially welcome, because the
task will not be.difficult, and because there is no portion
of the Bible from which one can learn so much as from that
which has been already well learned. The Bible is an
inexhaustible mine. The deeper you go, the richer and
more abundant are its treasures; the more you have, the
more there is for you to get; for " whosoever bath, to
him shall be given."
   Each of these review lessons covers fourteen chapters,
so that the student will have two chapters a day during
each week. Of course it is understood that even the
       DONATIONS THIS QUARTER FOR MISSION WORK
                ACTS OF THE APOSTLES.                    31

most faithful student has not mastered the entire book;
that is in fact impossible; yet it is possible to acquire so
thorough a knowledge of it that whenever any chapter is
mentioned, the mind will at once recall its contents, or, if
any event is referred to, or any statement quoted, it can
at once be located, and the connection given. No one
should be satisfied short of this. When this is gained,
then can one really find satisfaction in studying the book.
It can thus be seen that the study of the book must by no
means end with this series of lessons. Indeed, the only way
10.keep what you already have is to continue the study,
and gain more. The questions that follow are only sug-
gestive. There is no end to the number that may be
asked. It would be well in each class to have a brief out-
line of the chapters. This need take but a few minutes.
Go through the questions in order and then ask promis-
cuous questions. Then the teacher can use his judg-
ment as to what topics he will call special attention 10.
In a review lesson of all lessons, the teacher should con-
fine himself strictly to asking questions.
     i. Tell the chief things recorded in Acts 1.
     2. To what one thing is the second chapter devoted?
     3. Into what two portions is the third chapter natu-

An—
      Invitation . . . .

      The Story of Redemption
  Is the title of our latest book. Its object is to preach
  Christ to the world, to assure the sinner that the plan of
  redemption was planned for him. It abounds with new
  and beautiful truths concerning the redemption of man,
  and will leave the reader an inspiration for a higher and
  nobler life.
       One chapter is entitled"-Righteousness Received
  through Christ," and so plainly and 'carefully is the
  wonderful truth explained that it seems impossible for
  the honest reader to misunderstand- it. In fact, it is a
  practical book, an evangelical book, and a hook that will
  draw men to,Christ. It does not present many doctrinal
  points, it is true; but as we have other books thoroughly
  covering those things, the author has not deemed it nec-
  essary to treat them here.
       A great effort has been made to illustrate the work
  in a way that will impress upon the mind the truths of
  the text. The utmost care has been taken in the printing
  and binding, that they, also, may appropriately set forth
  the Gospel.
       Having done all we can, we invite you to give this.
  book to the world. For terms, territory and prices, ad-
  dress your State Tract Society or the publishers.
