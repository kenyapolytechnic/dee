                         PREFACE.
    THE most thorough student of the book of Genesis will
know that he has only begun to comprehend the majestic
truths recorded there; for from the first to the last chapter,
whether as history or as prophecy, he finds divine revelations
of "the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowl-
edge of God," and can but exclaim, with Paul, "How unsearch-
able are His judgments, and His ways past tracing out!" The
history and the prophecy, the types and the symbols, the
forms and ceremonies, the manners and customs, the style of
thought and method of expression,—all show that the patri-
archs were men of great intellectual penetration and spiritual
foresight. And those whose history is specially recorded, were
men who loved to commune with God, their recognized
strength. They saw the history of God's people in the plan
of redemption unto the final consummation. The mighty work-
ings in their souls of the mystery of. iniquity, or of the
mystery of godliness, was typical of the great struggle which
is continually going on in the hearts of the children of men.
Thus every recorded act of theirs is "for our admonition upon
whom the ends of the world are come."
   This series has been interspersed with lessons by the topical,
or outline, method: These are given only as models, and the
                                                   (3)

student should outline each lesson for himself, studying the
Scripture texts, asking and answering questions, reciting and
reviewing lessons, from such outlines from week to week.
The sank order and method of study are otherwise recom-
mended as during the past quarter.

                             NOTE.
   Notice that Abraham's servant's prayer was of the heart
trueprayer, a prayer which received an immediate answer.
"Prayer is the opening of the heart to God as to a friend.
Not that it is necessary, in order to make known to God what
we are, but in order to enable us to receive Him." " Every
prayer which is sent up in faith from an honest heart, will be
heard of God and answered; and the one that sent up the
petition will have the blessing when he needs it most, and it
will often exceed his expectations. Not a prayer of a true
saint is lost if sent up in faith, from an honest heart."

                            NOTE.
   "There was no arbitrary choice on the part of God, by
which Esau was shut out from the blessings of salvation. The
gift of His grace through Christ is free to all." Esau sold his
birthright for a mess of pottage. This was his own voluntary
act. The success of Jacob in defrauding Esau of the blessing
which he desired did not deprive him of the privilege of secur-
ing God's blessing. See Isa. 55 : 6, 7; Rev. 22 : 17. " Man
turns from God, not God from him." The responsibility now
is with man. God hated Esau only in the sense that He hates
sin. See " Patriarchs and Prophets," pages 207, 208.

    q. Note that Isaac blessed Jacob in the name of God, but
Esau only in his own name, and that this was in harmony with
their desires. The one was spiritual, the other carnal. Isaac's
words were prophetic. Heb. I : 20.

                            NOTES.

    i. This is the only way back to God. " Here the Redeemer
identifies Himself as the mystic ladder that makes communi-
cation possible between heaven and earth." " In assuming
humanity, Christ planted the ladder firmly upon the earth.
The ladder reaches unto the highest heaven, and God's glory
shines-from its summit, and illuminates its whole length, while
the angels pass to and fro with messages from God to man,
with petition and praise from man to God. Through the
divine nature, Christ was one with the Father ; and by assum-
ing humanity, He identified Himself with man. He `being
in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with
God; but made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Him
the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men.'
In the vision of Jacob was represented the union of the human
and the divine in Christ. As the angels pass to and fro on
the ladder, God is represented as looking down with favor
upon the children of men, because of the merit of His Son."
"The sinner can not take one step unless the Spirit draws 1] ;
he must cling to Christ if he would be saved. If he ascends
to heaven, it must be by mounting up step by step the whole
height of Christ's work, so that Christ shall be his wisdom,
righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. The gaining
of eternal life is no easy thing. By living faith we are to keep
on reaching forward, ascending the ladder round by round,
seeing and taking the necessary steps; and yet we must under-
stand that not one holy thought, not one unselfish act, can be
originated in self. It is only through Christ that there can be
any virtue in humanity. Without Christ we can do no good
thing, but with Him we may do all things."—Review, .thoo,
No. 44.
   2. Note the number and the order of the promises made to
Jacob in verses 13-15, and the fitness of each to comfort and
encourage him ever after that memorable night. What must
have been his state of mind and heart on the night previous,

in order to receive so glorious a revelation concerning the
future of himself and his posterity ! (a) He felt lonely; but
God said, " I am with thee." (b) He was fearful; but God said,
" I will keep thee." (c) He felt forsaken; but God said, " I
will not leave thee." (d) He had no property with him; and
his father's blessing seemed lost forever; but God said, " I will
do that which I have spoken to thee of." (a) He thought that
he might be slain; but God said, " In thy seed shall all the
families of the earth be blessed." How terrible must Jacob's
misdeeds have seemed to him after that angel vision ! but how
precious the plan of salvation !

                      ADDITIONAL STUDY.

   1. Trace carefully the causes of Jacob's exile. Are we in
banishment? If so, why?
   2. From the human standpoint, who was most prosperous

the earthly inheritance, (b) of the heavenly birthright? Gen.

for life.
   6. Note the order of return to God; distress, humility, lone-
liness, repentance, prayer, visions of glory.
   7. In what special promise did Adam and Eve see Christ?
Did Abel? Enoch? Noah? Abraham? Isaac? Jacob? We?
   8. What does every one behold who really sees Christ? See
John I : 51. There are two ways of seeing Him—by. fear and
by love. " This is the finger of God," said the tremblingly

opposing Egyptian astrologers; and the heart of Pharaoh was
hardened. Ex. 8: 19. Love discerns Him.             " it . is the
Lord," said the loving and beloved disciple; and the hearts of
the disciples were melted with joy. John 21 : 7, 8. Behold the
ladder; study the ladder; walk upon the ladder; see the angels
with you on the ladder; behold God above the ladder.

                             NOTE.

   It was Jacob's own course that rendered his experience in
Haran necessary. " Evil imparted, also returns again. Every
one who has been free to condemn, or discourage, will in his own
experience be brought over the ground where he has caused
others to pass; will feel what they have suffered because of his
want of sympathy and tenderness. It is the love of God toward
us that has decreed this. He would lead us to abhor our own
hardness of heart, and to open our hearts to let Jesus abide in
them. And thus, out of evil, good is brought, and what
appeared a curse becomes a blessing. . . . In slighting the
claims of the poor, the suffering, and the sinful, we are proving

ourselves traitors to Christ. It is because men take upon them-
selves the name of Christ, while in life they deny His character,

   1. " Mahanaim " signifies two hosts. Jacob named the
place " Mahanaim," because he saw two host of heavenly
angels. It is when passing through the deepest waters, encom-
passed with greatest doubt and perplexity, difficulty and
danger, that the angels of God encamp about the children of
His care. If by the eye of faith we could only see them day
by day, as they really are, no fear would disturb our souls.
See Deut. 32 : so; Ps. 32 : S; 2 Chron. 16: 9; 2 Kings 6: 14-17;
Ps. 34 7-
    2. Jacob's external struggle was the result of a mightier
struggle within. It was a strife between self and God. When
the angel gained the victory over that soul, Jacob was crucified;
it was then that, in the strength of his mighty Contestant, he
conquered; it was then that Jacob, the Supplanter, could receive
a new name, Israel, Prince of God, power with man. That
night had been one of darkness and suffering, but the morning
was one of light and glory. The greatest suffering precedes the
greatest glory. Now Jacob could see the face of God, and as
he " passed over Penuel," the sun rose upon him. Just so,
when we pass through "the night of Jacob's trouble,"
we shall be prepared through suffering, with bodies glorified,
to behold with joy the face of God ; and " the Sun of Right-
eousness shall arise with healing in His wings." Suffering
precedes the glory. See Luke 24 : 26; Dan. II : 35; Acts 14 : 22;
Phil. 3 : 21; Roni. S: IS; 2 Tim. 2: 12.

of huinan planning to accomplish the designs of God. " The
wisdom of any human agent is not sufficient for' the planning
and devising in this time. Spread every plan before God; with
fasting, with the humbling of the soul before the Lord Jesus,
and commit thy ways unto the Lord, and the promise is,
shall direct thy paths.' " " The Lord will work in this last work

   1. "As the lad stood before his brothers, his beautiful
countenance lighted up with the spirit of inspiration, they
could not withhold their admiration ; but they did not choose
to renounce their evil ways, and they hated the purity that
reproved their sins. The same spirit that actuated Cain was
kindling in their hearts."
   2. Stephen says that the " patriarchs, moved with envy,
sold Joseph into Egypt." Acts 7 : 9. Envy signifies: (t) "Mal-
ice; ill-will; spite." (2) " Chagrin, mortification, discontent,
or uneasiness at the sight of another's excellence or good
fortune; a repining at the prosperity or good of another."
Who can stand before envy? Prov. 27 : 4. The beginning of
the history of the children of Israel was marked with envious
hatred against their younger brother, just as the end of their
history was characterized by the most intensely hitter hatred,
even unto death, against their Elder Brother. Joseph was the
tender and most-beloved son of his father, through whom he
desired communication with his children; but his brethren
sold him for twenty pieces of silver : Jesus was the only-
begotten Son of God, through whom He emptied His heart
of infinite love upon His fallen sons of earth; but they sold
Him for thirty pieces of silver.

                            NOTES.
   I. Joseph was comely, winsome, well-favored; but he did
not exalt himself. In all Old Testament history there is no life
more universally admired for its frank, open, humble simplicity,
and the fragrant beauty of its purity; and, withal, in its growth
more " strong in a strength not its own." It was his upright
and holy life that gave him power with God. But every young
man and woman may, by following his example, be like him.
" He [man] may be enlightened by science, ennobled by virtue,
and make progress in mental and moral dignity, until he
reaches a perfection of intelligence and a purity of character
but little lower than the perfection and purity of the angels.
With the light of truth shining upon the minds of men, and
the love of God shed abroad in their hearts, we can not con-
ceive what they may become, nor what great work they may
do."
    2. What the Lord needs to-day is young men like Joseph
and Moses in Egypt, Daniel and his fellows in Babylon, John
the Baptist in Judea, and Paul in the civilized and heathen
portions of the world. In order to be this, they must, like
Joseph, have God with them in the prison; like Moses, endure
as seeing Him who is invisible; like Daniel and his fellows,
swerve not from duty, though cast into the lions' den, or into
the fiery furnace; like John the Baptist, stand before and
reprove kings; and, like Paul, pass undaunted through that long
category of trial and persecution, counting it all joy that he
is considered worthy to suffer for Christ's sake.

  Joseph had learned the lesson of submission to the will of
God, so that he did riot seek to lay plans, or to concoct schemes,
for extricating himself from difficulty; but he left his case to
be decided in the higher court. He seemed to be going down
the ladder, yet when, to outward observation, he had taken the
last step in that direction, he had reached the topmost round
even of earthly fame. He followed the law of true greatness—
that of service, which is the law of true goodness. Slavery in
the dungeon was followed,by service on the throne. See Matt.

    i. "Jacob said, 'All these things are against me.' It was a
great mistake. Joseph was alive—the governor of Egypt—sent
there to preserve their lives, and to be the stay of Jacob's closing
years. Simeon was also alive—the blessed link which was
drawing and compelling his brothers to return into the pres-
ence of the strange Egyptian governor. Benjamin would come
safely back again. All things, so far from being against him,
were working together for good to him; and if only he would
trust in God, he would live to see it so. All things are yours,
if you are Christ's. , All things serve you. Even those that
seem most awry and trying are really promoting your best
interests. . . . Let us cultivate the habit of looking at the
bright side of things. If there are only a few clouds floating
in your sky, do not state that the whole is overcast; and if all
the heaven is covered, save one small chink of blue, make
much of that; and by all means do not exaggerate the dark-
ness."—Meyer.

   2. " By the laws of caste, the Egyptians were forbidden to
eat with people of any other nation. The sons of Jacob had
therefore a table by themselves, while the governor, on account
of his high rank, ate by himself, and the Egyptians also had
separate tables. "—Patriarchs and Prophets, page 228.

                              NOTES.

    1. "This cup was supposed to possess power of detecting
any poisonous substances placed therein. At that day cups of
this kind were highly valued as a safeguard against murder by
poisoning. . . . 'What deed is this that ye have done? ' he
said; `wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine? '
Joseph designed to draw from them acknowledgment of their
sin. He had never claimed the power of divination, but was
willing to have them believe that he could read the secrets of
their lives."
   2. It is probable that the fame of Joseph had gone out all
over the world as an interpreter of dreams, and a preserver
of life, on account of his connection with the true and living
God. Note the impression which comes into the soul when
one recognizes that his life is in accordance with the divine
Plan. The revelation of God to Joseph in those two dreams
of his boyhood, seems to have given direction to his entire
inner and outer life. In these verses we see the large-hearted
sympathy of Joseph standing out in vivid contrast to the
cold-blooded envy which once found lodgment in the hearts
of his brethren. His was a high ideal of the Christian life;
and his high mission was recognized, not only by himself,
but by Pharaoh and his subjects, as well as by Israel and
his sons. See Gen. 45 ; 7; 41 :45; 47 ; 25; 45 ; 27, 28; 5o : 18-2o.
   3. "Another act of humiliation remained for the ten
brothers. They now confessed to their father the deceit and
cruelty that for so many years had embittered his life and
theirs. Jacob had not suspected them of so base a sill; but
he saw that all had been overruled for good, and he forgave

and blessed his erring children." He no doubt remembered
his own course of life which had resulted in so much sorrow
and trouble to himself and his loved ones. "Jacob had
sinned, and had deeply suffered. . . . Over and over
he saw repeated among his sons the sins of which he him-
self had been guilty. But, bitter as had been the discipline,
it had accomplished its work. The chastening, though griev-
ous, had yielded the peaceable fruits of righteousness."—

  to be seen both near and afar off, even if it becomes necessary
  for every nation of the earth to be stricken with famine.

    Make a careful study of the fulfilment of this last prophecy
of Jacob in the future history of the several tribes. Meyer
says : "Reuben, though the first-born, never excelled; no judge,
prophet, or ruler, sprang from his tribe. Simeon was almost
absorbed in the nomad tribes of southern Palestine. The
cities in which the sons of Levi dwelt were scattered through-
out all the tribes. Vestiges of terraced vineyards still attest
how well the hilly province assigned to Judah suited the culture
of the vine. Zebulun embosomed the Lake of Galilee, and
stretched away toward the coast of the blue Mediterranean.
Esdraelon, the battle-field of Palestine, where Assyria from the
north and Egypt from the south often met in deadly feud, lay
within the limits of Issachar. Dan was small as an adder, but,
like it, could inflict dangerous wounds on any invader who had
to pass by it towards the heart of the country. Gad, much
pressed by border war. Asher, notable for fertility. Naphtali,
famous for eloquence. Benjamin, cruel as a wolf. All these
justified the prophecy of their dying ancestor, whilst the
mighty tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, springing from the
sons of Joseph, inherited to the full ' blessings of heaven above ;
blessings of the deep that lieth under ; blessings of the breast

and of the womb ; blessings to the utmost bounds of the ever-
lasting hills.' " Jacob's " paternal tenderness would have found
expression only in words of encouragement and hope ; but the
power of God rested upon him, and under the influence of
inspiration, he was constrained to declare the truth, however
painful."—Patriarchs and Profihels, bage 237.

    i. Make an outline of this chapter.
    2. Read Deuteronomy 33, and compare with this chapter.
   3. Look up the character of the several symbols mentioned
in Jacob's dying prophecy, and observe their appropriateness
in each instance.
   4. In the study of the prophecy concerning Judah, note
what is the only royalty of worth in the sight of God, and what
the only law. Observe that at the close of Solomon's reign,
his kingdom was divided into Israel, or Ephraim, and Judah,
but that at the time of Christ, Ephraim was absorbed in Judah,
and thus the scepter did not depart from Judah till Shiloh
came. See Hosea 4: 17 ; Ps. 78 : 67-69.
    5. Why are the faults and follies of Bible characters re-
corded as well as their virtues and victories? Has this fact
been of any help to you? What?
   6. Note how the prophetic spirit was preserved during the
history of God's people up to this point in the lives of Enoch,
Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. The study of this
early history and prophecy stood first in the schools of the
prophets as well as in the lives of the prophets themselves.
Adam and Eve continually saw the seed of the woman ; Abel
looked to the Lamb of God slain from the foundation of the
world ; Enoch beheld the Lord coming with ten thousand of
His saints ; Noah was enraptured with the rainbow glory about
the throne ; Abraham saw the Father and the Son to the com-
pletion of the great mediatorial plan and the ratification of the
everlasting covenant ; Isaac witnessed the results of that plan
and that ratified covenant, " On earth peace, good-will toward

WONDERS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
      The above is the title of a forthcoming tract by Elder A. 0.
   Tait which will be published October 1st as No. 155 of the Bible
   Students' Library. It discusses the wonderful inventions and
   discoveries of this century and gives their true significance. It
   will be well illustrated and contain about forty pages. The price
   will be about $2.50 per hundred, but it wilt not be printed on the
   cover, hence a retail price of five cents may be readily obtained.
   This is a timely tract and its sale will no doubt equal that of
   "Alarm of War."

ME DESIRE OF AGES




                             Actual Size, 7x10%
      The above is the title of the long-looked-for life of Christ, by Mrs.
E. G. White. It is much more than a life of Christ, however; it is a use
of that life as a great object lesson with which to illustrate lice principles of
true Christian living. For that reason no more important book can be
placed before a people living, as we are, amid the perils of the last days.
      For-over ten years the author has been at work on the manuscript,
and for a year and a half a corps of New York's best artists, under the
supervision of our own art director, have been engaged in studying and
illustrating it. Their work consists of 38 full-page engravings,87 illumi-
nated chapter headings, and nearly 300 text illustrations. All of these
have been designed especially for this book.
      There is nearly twice as much matter in this book as in " Great
Controversy," hence it seemed necessary at first to publish it in two
volumes, but enlarging the page to 7x10 inches enables us to issue it in
one 900-page volume at the following prices:
                  Cloth, marbled edges        -   -         $3.50
                  Cloth, gilt edges    -    -       -     - 4 25
                  Library, marbled edges -        -          5.00
                  Full Morocco, gilt edges      -         - 700
                  Prospectus -       -    -   -   -     -    1.25
       It will be ready about Oct. 15th. For terms and territory, address
 your State Tract Society.                                                        •

                     In just a few months it will be twenty-fiv9 years since
                   the Signs of the Times was started on its mission.
                     These twenty-five years have marked exceedingly mar-
                   velous developments in the fulfilling of prophecy. This
                   wonderful procession of events, showing that the Lord's
                   coming is right at hand, is most intensely thrilling when
                   we take time to consider it.
                     On January 5, 1899, the Signs of the Times will be a
                   32-page double number, with an artistic,decorative cover,
                   making four pages more. In this issue, these wonderful
                   fulfillments of prophecy during the last twenty-five years
                   will be set forth. The very best of writers are preparing
                   the matter now. Good artists are illustrating it fully
                   so as to clearly present, in the light of God's great
                   prophetic word, the absorbing movements and conditions
                   of this time.
                     This will be the most important issue of the Signs of
                   the Times ever printed, and it should have at least a
                   million circulation. Bvery Sabbath-school Superintend-
                   ent, officer, teacher, and scholar is needed to help in
                   this work. Write us at once for further particulars. Lay
