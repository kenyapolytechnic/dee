   "Then we may know that the time has
   come for the marvelous working of
   Satan and that the end is near."

     The foregoing is a definite, positive, clear statement, made by the
 Spirit of the Lord. Observe how clearly it is said that we may " know "
 when the time has come for the marvelous working of Satan, and when the
Pend is near.

     The context of this significant utterance is the following:—

      " By the decree enforcing the institution of the Papacy in violation of
 the law of God, our nation will disconnect herself fully from righteousness.
 When Protestantism shall stretch her hand across the gulf to grasp the
 hand of the Roman power, when she shall reach over the abyss to clasp
 hands with Spiritualism, when, under the influence of this threefold union,
 our country shall repudiate every principle of its Constitution as a Protes-
 tant and Republican Government, and shall make provision for the propa-
 gation of Papal falsehoods and delusions, then we may know that the
 time has come for the marvelous working of Satan, and that the end
 is near.

     " As the approach of the Roman armies was a sign to the disciples of
 the impending destruction of Jerusalem, so may this apostasy be a sign to
 us that the limit of God's forbearance is reached, that the measure of our
 nation's iniquity is full, and that the angel of mercy is about to take her
 flight, never to return."—Testimony 32, p. 207.

      We have observed for years the developments in this country in the
 way of the enforcement of Sunday laws, but these Sunday laws can never
 become generally oppressive until the prophecy is fulfilled which tells us
 that this nation shall speak as a " dragon." ( See Rev. 13:If.) The proph-
 ecies in Revelation, as well as this statement from the Testimonies, show that
 the United States is to depart from its principles of Republicanism, as well
 as its principles of Protestantism; and that awful time being reached, then
 are we to know that the time has come for the marvelous working of Satan,
 and that the end is right upon us.

     The seeds of departure from its Protestant principles have already been
 widely sown through National Reform ideas that have been promulgated.
 The seeds of apostasy from Republicanism which will lead it to the place
 where it speaks as a dragon in the enforcement of Sunday laws and other
 like oppressive measures are being as widely sown; and by these things we
may know that the time has even now come for the marvelous working of
Satan, and that the end of all things is right at hand.

     In view of these things, every power of the mind, and body, and heart
should be given to the Lord, that he may use us as His own in the promul-
gation of His truth in the world, and every agency should be worked to its
fullest capacity. It is with these great and impressive thoughts from the
Lord's own prophecies in mind, that the publishers of the SIGNS OP THE
TIMES are preparing the special issue to be dated November 28, 1900, and
entitled " World's Outlook Number." The thrilling events of the present
will make this the most valuable number of the SIGNS that has ever been
issued. A few of the subjects that will be presented follow:—

A BRIEF REVIEW OF THE CENTURY; Social, religious, political.

PROPHETIC AMERICAN OUTLOOK: This country in the world's problems, as fore.
   told in Revelation 13.

PROPHETIC EUROPEAN OUTLOOK: International condition of the nations; feeling
   of the masses; socialism, etc.

CHURCH AND STATE OUTLOOK: Tendencies everywhere toward closer union, with
   Sunday the center.

PROPHETIC PAPAL OUTLOOK: Wounded in 1798; recovery and rapid development
   of strength; present power; what the end will be.

PROFESSED PROTESTANT OUTLOOK: Principles of the true; departure therefrom,
   and the sure result.

MISSIONS OUTLOOK: The everlasting Gospel to the world.

THE CHRISTIAN'S OUTLOOK: Triumph over sin; regenerated earth and people.


    But no list of subjects can adequately present to the mind the thrilling
themes that will be presented in this important issue of our " pioneer "
missionary paper. No pains are being spared to make it the best. It will
be a double number, carefully illustrated, with special decorative cover.

     It is.desired that every Sabbath-school and church of our people shall
thoroughly organize by November I, when these papers will bd ready for
distribution, to place a copy in every home throughout the land. Let us as
one man put our shoulders to the wheel and do the work of the Lord with
earnestness in these times, which demand such prompt and energetic
action.

     LESSON 1.—THE CURSE OF THE LAW.


                        October 6, 1900.

                        (Gal. 3:3-10, R. V.)


   "HE therefore that supplieth to you the Spirit, and worketh
miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by
the hearing of faith? Even as Abraham believed God, and it
was reckoned unto him for righteousness. Know therefore that
they which be of faith, the same are sons of Abraham. And the
Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by
faith, preached the Gospel beforehand unto Abraham, saying, In
thee shall all the nations be blessed. So then they which be of
faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham. For as many as are
of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written,
Cursed is every one which continueth not in all things that are'
written in the book of the law, to do them."

     For the sake of the connection, this lesson includes three
verses of the preceding lesson, taking only three in advance.
The earnest student will be glad of this opportunity to get, the
verses already passed over more firmly fixed in mind, and will
find the lesson sufficiently long to occupy all the time and
thought he can bestow upon it. Let us put a few questions to
it ; examine the text closely, and see how it answers them.
                         LESSONS IN GALATIANS.

                                QUESTIONS.

        How is the Spirit ministered, and by what means are miracles
    worked? Is it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of
    faith? What is the obvious answer?
        With whose experience is the ministering of the Spirit and
    the working of miracles identical?
        How did Abraham get righteousness?
        Who then are the children of Abraham?
        What was foreseen in the Scriptures?
        What, therefore, was done?
        In what words was the Gospel preached to Abraham?
        Of what was the preaching of the Gospel to Abraham a proof?
        Who, then, are blessed? With whom are they blessed?
        Who are cursed?
        Why are they cursed who are of the works of the law?
        What, then, would be their condition if they should do, and
    continue to do, all things written in the law?

                                  NOTES.

        I. "They which are of faith, the same are the children of
    Abraham." Abraham is the father of all them that believe,
    whether they be circumcised or uncircumcised. Rom. 4: 11. No
    one, no matter of what nation or people, will enter heaven except
    as the child of Abraham. The faithful followers of Christ are
    the real seed of Abraham.
'       2. From the very beginning, long before the days of Abraham,
    it was foreseen that God would justify the heathen through faith.
    Faith is the only possible means of salvation ; and unless it was
    the heathen who were justified by it, no one on earth could be
    justified, since all were heathen. In the fall of Adam, all men
    became heathen—wanderers from the one true God.

    3. The preaching of the Gospel to Abraham was the proof
that God would justify the heathen through faith ; for Abraham
was born a heathen. "The father of Abraham and the father of
Nachor " "served other gods." Joshua 24 : 2. The very existence
of the Jewish nation, therefore, and their separation' from the
nations of earth, was a standing witness to the fact that it was
God's plan to save as many heathen as would believe.

       4. The Gospel was preached to Abraham in the words, "In
    thee shall all nations be blessed." If you wish to know what this
    blessing is, read Rom. 4 : 1-9. It is the blessing of forgiveness of
                      LESSONS IN GALATIANS.                          7

 sin. It is the blessing of the righteousness of God through the
 faith of Jesus Christ. This blessing has come upon all men, for
 "as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to con-
- demnation ; even so by the righteousness of One the free gift
 came upon all men unto justification of life." Rom. 5 : 18. What
 a pity that all will not take the gift thus freely bestowed !

    5. All, however, who believe, who "are of faith," that is, of faith
alone,—not faith and works, but faith which works,—are blessed
with faithful Abraham. Righteousness—right-doing, obedience
to the law—comes by faith alone, and not by any works of law
done by man. Christ is not dead in vain. See Gal. 2 : 21. Who-
ever would be justified by his own obedience is seeking to frus-
trate the grace of God, and to prove that it was not necessary for
Christ to die. Every such attempt will fail.

   6. Since they who are of faith are blessed, it follows that they
who are of works are cursed, else God would be denying Himself.
What is the matter with the law? Is it not good?—Oh, yes ; it
is all right! "The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and
just, and good." Rom. 7 : 12. Then why is the one who does it
under the curse?—He is not. Here is where so many stumble in
their reading. It is written, "Cursed is every one that continuetlz
not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do
them." This is of itself proof that the law is good, and that
"blessed are they tha4,do His commandments." If men did, and
continued to do, all things that are written in the law, they would
be blessed.
   7. But "all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God."
Rom. 3 : 23. "The carnal mind is enmity against God ; for it is
not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be." Rom. 8 :7.
Therefore it is that "by the works of the law there shall no flesh
be justified" (Rom. 3:2o), and as many as seek justification by it
are under the curse. Note that not only the wilful transgressors,
but even the seekers after righteousness, if they seek it by their
own works, are under the curse. Yet some will be blessed. Yes ;
"they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham,"
because faith works by love, and love is the fulfilling of the law.
We are made righteous by faith, and by faith are we kept right-
eous. "The just shall live by faith."

        LESSON 11.—THE CURSE REI1OVED.


                          October 13, 1900.
                          (Gal. 3 :9-14, R. V.)


   "THEY which be of faith are blessed with the faithful Abra-
ham. For as many as are of the works of the law are under a
curse; for it is written, Cursed is every one which continueth not
in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.
Now that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, is
evident ; for, The righteous shall live by faith ; and the law is
not of faith ; but, he that doeth them shall live in them. Christ
redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse
for us ; for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a
tree ; that upon the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abra-
ham in Christ Jesus ; that we might receive the promise of the
Spirit through faith."
   Do not forget to review from the beginning each time. Before
you begin the study of this lesson, be sure that you know every
word of what precedes it in the chapter, not by rote, but in reality.
Do not forget the first two chapters either. You should read care-
fully from the beginning of the epistle several times each week,
so as to keep everything fresh in mind. Very frequent reviews
and constant application are the only means by which the epistle
can be mastered ; but it can be done by every one, and the result
will more than repay all the effort expended.
                            QUESTIONS.

   Who are blessed? With whom?
   Who are under the curse? Why?
   What is evident? Why?
   By what are men not justified?
   How do the just live?
   With what is the law not connected?
   On what condition only can a man get life from the law?
   From what has Christ redeemed us?
   Who has redeemed us from the curse of the law?
   Has He redeemed us, or will He redeem us? (Note the text
carefully.)
   How has He redeemed us from the curse of the law?
                    LESSONS IN eALATIANS.                          9

   What is the evidence that He became a curse for us?
   By what, then, is the curse removed?
   Why did Christ redeem us from the curse of the law?
   Upon whom does the blessing of Abraham come through the
cross of Jesus Christ?
   What do we receive? By what means?

                               NOTES.
   1. "The righteous shall live by faith." That makes it evident
that no one is justified by works, for if it were by works, then it
could not be of faith. Notice how the one thought throughout
this epistle, as far as we have studied, is the sufficiency of Christ
as the Saviour from sin. "There is none other name under
heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved."
   2. "The law is not of faith." The law says, "Do this !" or
"Do not do that." The written law, either in a book or on tables
of stone, is of course what is referred to here , not the law in
Christ, the Living Stone. "The man that doeth them shall live
in them." That is the one condition on which a man can get life
by the law. But none have done the requirements of the law, and
so there can be no doers of the law ; for even though one should
from this moment do everything that the law requires, yet, since
he can not do more than his duty, his former transgressions rest
upon him. Thus he would be a law-breaker at the end, in spite
of all his good efforts. That man who is of the law alone, which
means that he trusts in his own power to do the righteousness
required by the law, is necessarily under its curse, condemned as
a law-breaker by that in which he trusts.
   3. " Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law." It
is a work finished, complete. Our part is but to accept what
Christ has done for us. It is as true of all mankind as it is of a
single individual, that they have been redeemed. The price has
been paid, and they belong to the Lord. Only the knowledge of
this glorious truth can save any soul from sin. It is the goodness
of God that leads to repentance.

    4. Never forget that it is from the curse of the law, not its
blessing, that Christ hath redeemed us. There is a blessing pro-
nounced on those who do the commandments (Rev. 22 :14), and
from this Christ has not redeemed us. It is from the curse—
failure to do the law—that He redeemed us. He is not the min-
ister of sin, but of righteousness.
  5. What is the curse of the law?—It is disobedience and its
consequence, death. " Cursed is every one which continueth not
IO                   LESSONS IN GALATIANS.

in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them."
Also, " cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree." These two
statements, taken together, show that if " all things " that the law
requires are not done, and done continually, the man is cursed
and must die. The curse of disobedience carries with it the
curse of death. But from all this Christ hath delivered us. He
has redeemed us, brought us back, to be faithful servants of God.
He has redeemed us from disobedience, so that we may continue
in all things which are written in the law, to do them. "For what
the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God
sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin,
condemned sin in the flesh; that the righteousness of the law
might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the
Spirit." Rom. 8 : 3, 4. By the Spirit the law is written in the
heart, so that he who walks after the Spirit must necessarily con-
tinue in the law. What a blessed redemption!
    6. What has Christ done to redeem us from the curse of the
law—from disobedience to the law?—He has been made a curse
for us. Isa. 53 : 12. God "made Him to be sin for us," although
He knew no sin, "that we might be made the righteousness of
God in Him." 2 Cor. 5 : 21. Being made sin, He necessarily suf-
fered death as a sinner; for the evidence that He has redeemed
us from the curse of the law is the fact that He was hanged on
a tree. This shows us that death is the curse of the law. Diso-
bedience means death. All this Christ gladly suffered to redeem
us from disobedience and death. It is in the cross that Christ
redeemed us; the cross removes the curse. In this one fact all
science is embraced.
    7. Why did Christ redeem us from the curse of the law?—
" That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles
through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the
Spirit through faith." Do not let the following items escape your
notice, as you read these verses:—
    (a) The apostle Paul was a Jew, writing to converts from
among the Gentiles; yet he classes himself with them. " Christ
hath redeemed us from the curse of the law."
    (b) Christ was made a curse for us, "that the blessing of
Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ."
Here again the apostle shows that there is no difference between
Jew and Gentile. His being made a curse for us, brings the
blessing on the Gentiles.
    (c) Again is the same thing shown by the further statement
that this occurred " that we might receive the promise of the,
Spirit through faith." By one Spirit do all men, of whatever
race, have access to the Father. Eph. 2 :18.
                    LESSONS IN GALATIANS.                       I/


   (d) The blessing of Abraham comes only through the cross of
Christ. It was the blessing of sins forgiven,—the gift of the per-
fect righteousness of God; and this comes only through Christ.
Therefore Abraham's faith was in Christ and His cross.
    8. "The promise of the Spirit." Note well that this does not
say the gift of the Spirit, but the promise of the Spirit. Now it
is true that the Spirit is sent by Jesus Christ; but that is not
what is spoken of here. The promise of the Spirit is what is
spoken of. But all the sacrifice of Christ was not made merely
that God might make the promise that we should receive the
Spirit. The promise of the gift of the Spirit is in the very sacri-
fice of Christ. So it is very evident that "the promise of the
Spirit " means not the promise of the gift of the Spirit, but the
promise which the Spirit makes to us. The expression is used in
the same signification as "the promise of God." The Spirit is
given to all, and what is here spoken of is a promise which comes
through the Spirit,—the Spirit's promise to us. What that
promise is, will appear as we proceed.




LESSON III,—THE PROMISE OF THE INHER-
             ITANCE SURE.


                         October 20, 1900.
                         (Gal. 3: 15-i5, R. V.)



   " BRETHREN, I speak after the manner of men: Though it be
but a man's covenant, yet when it hath been confirmed, no one
maketh it void, or addeth there10. Now to Abraham were the
promises spoken, and to his seed. He saith not, And to seeds, as
of many; but as of one, And to thy Seed, which is Christ. Now
this I say: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law,
which came four hundred and thirty years after, doth not dis-
annul, so as to make the promise of none effect. For if the in-
heritance is of the law, it is no more of promise; but God hath
granted it to Abraham by promise."
  All the suggestive hints, and instruction as to careful study and
review, that have accompanied all the preceding lessons, apply
12                  LESSONS IN GALATIANS.


here. It is absolutely essential that you know all the preceding
part of this epistle, in order that you may well understand what
follows. Study and think. But do not mistake speculation for
thinking. Do not try to make a meaning out of what is written,
but fix your minds upon the sentences until the meaning that is
in them reveals itself. The mental discipline to be obtained in
studying such a portion of Scripture as this until you have mas-
tered it, is worth more than can be computed. That, however, is
only a secondary matter, after all. The great gain to us is the
knowledge of God and His salvation. In the Scripture God takes
us into His confidence, and reveals to us His secrets.

                          QUESTIONS.

    When a covenant made by man is confirmed, how sure is it?
    " No one maketh it void-, or addeth there10."
    To whom were the promises made?
    "To Abraham and his seed."
   By whom were the promises made?
    How explicit was the promise?
    " He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, and
to thy Seed."
    Who is the seed to whom the promise was made?
   " And to thy Seed, which is Christ."
    Is there more than one seed to whom the promise was made?
  "He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to
thy Seed, which is Christ."
    Of whom is Christ the seed?
   " To Abraham and his seed were the promises made; .
and to thy Seed, which is Christ."
    Who are joined in the promises?
   " Abraham and his seed."
   Then when Christ receives the promises here referred to, who
must share them with Him?
   Since even a man's covenant, once confirmed, can not be made
void, or added to, what of God's covenant?
    " The covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ,
the law . . . can not disannul."
   How long after the confirming of the covenant did the law
come in?
    " Four hundred and thirty years after."
    Could the giving of the law make any change in the covenant
already made with Abraham?
    " Though it be but a man's covenant, yet when it hath been
confirmed, no one maketh it void, or addeth there10." Likewise,
"the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the
                    LESSONS. IN GALATIANS.                      13


law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, can not dis-
annul, that it should make the promise of none effect."
    What would be the result of the disannulling of the covenant,
if such a thing were possible?
    It would " make the promise of none effect."
    What, then, is the covenant which God made and confirmed?
    What would be the case if the inheritance were by the law?
    Is would be " no more of promise."
    How did God give it to Abraham?
    "God gave, it to Abraham by promise."
    What was it that God gave to Abraham by promise?
    " The inheritance."
    Then to what did the promises made to Abraham and his seed
have reference?
    " God gave it [the inheritance] to Abraham by promise."
    To whom besides Abraham was the inheritance promised?
    " And to thy Seed, which is Christ."
                             NOTES.

   I. Since even a man's covenant can not be in any way changed
after it has been confirmed, it follows that the same thing must
he most emphatically the case with a covenant confirmed by God,
" who cau not lie."
   2. Christ is the seed of Abraham, and the only seed to whom
the promise was made. He is both spiritual and literal. He is a
real, literal, personal being, and He is spiritual, even a " quick-
ening Spirit."
   3. In verse 17 we see the conclusion of verse 15. A man's
covenant once confirmed, can not be changed; so the covenant
which God made with Abraham, can not be made void or altered
in any way by the entering of the law four hundred and thirty
years afterward.
   4. Verse 17 is a reversed sentence, the object coming first in-
stead of last, and therefore some people have difficulty in read-
ing it correctly. The verse simply states that the law can not
make the promise void, and disannul the covenant that was made
and confirmed by God four hundred and thirty years before.
      Note that the covenant and the promise are the same. To
disannul the covenant is to make the promise of none effect. We
see this when we pay attention to the connection between verses
15 and 16, and also between 17 and IS. Do not go to Webster or
to any other dictionary for a definition of "covenant," when God's
covenant is in question. Go instead to the Bible. Dictionaries
14                   LESSONS IN GALATIANS.


do not make language ; their purpose is only to show how it is
used ; the dictionary makers have not considered the Bible usage
in this case. It is so rare for men to promise anything without
expecting an equivalent, that it has been taken for granted that
it is the same with God ; and so we have a covenant defined as "a
mutual agreement of two or more persons," etc. But "who hath
known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been His counselor?
or who hath first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed unto
Him again? For of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all
things." Rom. II : 34-36. God promises freely ; our part is sim-
ply to accept.
    6. Do not forget that Abraham is one of the leading characters
in this chapter. It is the covenant made with him that is here
referred 10. Carefully avoid the error of reading any one verse
as though it stood alone, having no connection with what precedes
and follows. In studying one verse, do not forget what you have
learned from preceding verses.
    7. In this lesson we learn what "the promise of the Spirit " is.
It is the inheritance. This is made clear by verse 18. That
which God promised to Abraham and his seed was the inherit-
ance. See Gen. 37 : 2-8. This covenant was confirmed by the
oath of God. See Heb. 6 : 13-18 and Gen. 22 : 16-18. The gift
of the Spirit is the pledge of the inheritance. E;ph. 1 :13, 14.




     LESSON IV.—THE LAW NOT AGAINST THE
                  PROMISE.


                          October 27,190o.
                      (Gal. 3: 17-21, first part, R. V.)




   "Now this I say : A covenant confirmed beforehand by God,
the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, doth
not disannul, so as to make the promise of none effect.'' For if the
inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise ; but God hath
granted it to Abraham by promise. I9What then is the law? It
was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come,
                    LESSONS IN GALATIANS.                        15

to whom the promise hath been made ; and it was ordained
through angels by the hand of a mediator. Now a mediator is not
a mediator of one ; but God is one. Is the law then against the
promises of God? God forbid."
   In each of these lessons we repeat a portion of the scripture
contained in the preceding lesson, so that the connection may be
maintained, and that the student may have opportunity to become
thoroughly familiar with it. To this end also, we take but a very
small portion in advance. There is surely no reason why every-
body should not get the text thoroughly fixed in mind, when so
small a portion is given each week ; yet the brightest student
need not feel that the lessons are too short, for in this portion of
the Scripture every sentence is rich enough in suggestion for an
entire lesson.
   In the first part of verse 19 the reading of the common version
is better than that of the revision. Leaving out the unnecessary
word "serveth," which, as indicated by being in Relic, has been
added by the translators, and not translated from the Greek, we
have the question, "Wherefore then the law? " That is the bet-
ter rendering of the Greek text, and the question is very perti-
nent, as will be seen by any one who closely follows the line of
thought.
   It should be noted that the words "God forbid," which are
frequently found in the hnglish translation of the New Testa-
ment, are not at all a translation of what is found in the Greek
text. The word " God " is not in the corresponding sentence in
the Greek. The best rendering that could be given would be
"not at all," or "not by any means." The expression is a very
emphatic negative.

                            QUESTIONS.

   How long before the giving of the law at Sinai was the cov-
enant made and confirmed to Abraham?
   By whom and to whom were the promises made?
   How was the covenant confirmed?
   The covenant having been confirmed, what could the law do?
   What relation have the covenant and the promise?
   Concerning what was the covenant made?
   How did God give the inheritance to Abraham?
   By what, then, does the inheritance certainly not come?
   Since the inheritance comes solely through the promise of
God, and not by the law four hundred and thirty years afterward,
what question naturally arises?
   "Wherefore then the law?"
16                   LESSONS IN GALATIANS.


   What is the answer to this question?
   "It was added [spoken] because of transgressions."
   What comes by the law?
   "By the law is the knowledge of sin." Rom. 3 : 20.
   How long was the law to stand as the witness against sin?
   "Till the seed should come."
   What seed?
   "The seed to whom the promise was made."
   What promise?
   The promise of an inheritance.
   To whom was this inheritance promised equally with the
seed?
   "To Abraham and his seed were the promises made."
   Through whose agency was the law given?
   "Through angels."
   In whose hand was it?
   "In the hand of a mediator."
   Could the law then be against the promise of God, although it
came in after the promise was confirmed?
   Not by any means.
                              NOTES.

    T. Remember that to Abraham and his seed were the promises
made, and that the covenant was confirmed by God with an oath.
Because God could swear by no one greater, He swore by Him-
self. The covenant with Abraham is summed up in one word—
inheritance. Compare Gen. 17 : 4-11 with Rom. 4 :9-13. God
promised to give Abraham and his seed the whole earth, not in
its present condition, but made new. "We, according to His
promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth
righteousness." 2 Peter 3 : 13.
   2. Righteousness will dwell in this inheritance, for it can be
gained only through righteousness,—the righteousness of faith.
The inheritance is a free gift, however, and therefore the right-
eousness that wins it is a free gift from God. " For the promise,
that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or
to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of
faith." Rom. 4 : 13. The " free gift," "the gift by grace," is.
"the gift of righteousness." Rom. 5 : 15-17.
   3. This covenant also embraces everlasting life, for it is to be
an everlasting inheritance. In the confirmation of the covenant
by the oath of God, it was said to Abraham, "Thy seed shall pos-
sess the gate of his enemies." Gen. 22 : 17. This means nothing
less than the destruction of death, for "the last enemy that shall
be destroyed is death." i Cor. 15 : 26. Abraham received the
                     LESSONS IN GALATIANS.                        17


sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which
he had before he was circumcised, that he might be the father of
all them that believe, whether circumcised or uncircumcised.
Rom: 4 : u. All who believe are Abraham's seed ; therefore the
promises to Abraham and his seed include the resurrection of all
the righteous, and the destruction of death; which of course
means an end of sin, and the renewing of the earth. All this is
given by the Lord as the reward of the righteousness, which is
itself His gift to all who believe.
    4. This covenant was confirmed four hundred and thirty years
before the law was given from Sinai; therefore the entering of
the law would have no effect upon it whatever. God never meant
to have any one think that the inheritance of righteousness was
to be obtained by means of the law given at Sinai ; for in that
case He would have been taking back His promise ; " for if the
inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise ; but God gave
it to Abraham by promise," and "He can not lie."
    5. "Wherefore then the law?" What was the use of giving it?
It was spoken because of transgressions,—because of faithlessness,
for "whatsoever is not of faith is sin." "The law entered, that the
offense might abound " (Rom 5 : 2o) ; "that sin by the command-
ment might become exceeding sinful" (Rom. 7 : 13). "But where
sin abounded, grace did much more abound."
    6. How long would the law have this duty to perform,—to tes-
tify against sinners and to stand as a witness to their faithlessness
and disloyalty? "Until the seed should come to whom the
promise was made." The seed "to whom the promise was made"
is not yet come. Remember that Abraham is the father of all
them that believe, so that the seed will not be fully come until all
who will believe shall have conic to the possession of the in-
heritance. Then will the promise be fulfilled. There will then
be no more need of a law to remind men of their sins, for the law
will be in the heart of each one, so that there will be no sin. The
name of Christ the King will be "THE LORD OUR RIGHT-
EOUSNESS."
   7. What assurance have we that we can ever be thus at peace
with the law which convicts us of sin and condemns us to death?
This, that it was ordained "in the hand of a Mediator," which is
Christ, "for there is one God, and one Mediator between God and
men, the man Christ Jesus." I Tim. 2 : 5. He is the medium by
which the kingdom of God and His righteousness are conveyed to
us. We have no need to fear the thunders of Sinai, so long as we
remember that the law which thunders is in the hand of a
Mediator, who gave Himself for our sins, and that the thunders
18                   LESSONS IN GALATIANS.

proceed from the throne of grace. Fven the thunders of Sinai
are but the "loud voice" of the message of God's everlasting
love. See Deut. 33 : 2; 3.
    8. "Is the law then against the promises of God? "—Far from
it ; not by any means. What then? It is in harmony with the
promise. (I) God did not give it without a purpose; (2) it was
not given as a means of obtaining the inheritance which is wholly
by promise; (3) but the law is not against the promise; (4) there-
fore the law must be in the line of the promises. Yes; the law
proclaimed from Sinai declares the righteousness which God put
into the heart of faithful Abraham, and which He has promised
to put into the hearts of all who believe. So, however great it
may show our sins to be, however high and impossible to be ful-
filled by us are its requirements, so much the more may we rest
with rejoicing in the promise and oath of God, who for His own
sake blots out all our sins, and works in us His own righteousness.
The law indeed requires things of us impossible for weak human
nature to perform, but God can do that which is impossible for
men; and the immeasurable greatness of the requirements of
the law, only reveal to us the immeasurable greatness of God's
promise.




          LESSON V.—PRISONERS OF HOPE.

                        November 3, Igoo.
                        (Gal. 3 : 18-26, R. V.)


   "IF the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise; but
God hath granted it to Abraham by promise. What then is the
law? [Wherefore then the law?] It was added because of trans-
gressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise hath
been made; and it was ordained through angels by the hand of
a mediator. Now a mediator is not a mediator of one; but God is
one. Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid
[not by any means]; for if there had been a law given which
could make alive, verily righteousness would have been by the law.
Howbeit the Scripture hath shut up all things under sin, that
the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that
believe. But before faith came, we were kept in ward under the
                    LESSONS IN GALATIANS.                      19

law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.
So that the law hath been our tutor to bring us unto Christ, that
we might be justified by faith. But now that faith is come, we
are no longer under a tutor. For ye are all the sons of God,
through faith, in Christ Jesus."
   "The Scripture }lath concluded all under sin," "for all have
sinned and come short of the glory of God." The rendering
"shut up" is, however, much better than "concluded," solely be-
cause it is simpler. The word "concluded " is borrowed from the
Latin, and means "shut up," but since it is used in so many
accommodated senses, the plain Anglo-Saxon equivalent is more
expressive. The idea to be conveyed is that of being shut up in
prison, as is shown by the words "in ward."
   To the earnest Bible student it will not be necessary to say,
Do not become tired of the frequent repetition of the Scripture
text, nor of the fact that so few verses are included in each
lesson; for lie will be glad of as much time and opportunity as
possible to meditate upon the sacred words, so that they may un-
fold their treasures to his understanding. Before studying the
verses in this lesson, go over the entire chapter from the begin-
ning, and be sure that you grasp the force of every sentence and
every word, and its relation to every other. There is much sweet-
ness in the words of the Lord,—they are sweeter than honey and
the honeycomb,—but they often need to be held in the mouth a
long time in order that the sweetness may be extracted.

                           QUESTIONS.

   By what means does the inheritance come?
   How did God give it to Abraham?
   How sure was the promise made?
   What effect could the entering of the law have upon the
covenant thus confirmed?
   What, then, was the use of the law?
   What has the law to do with transgressions?
   "By the law is the knowledge of sin."
   For how long a time will the law stand as the revealer and con-
demner of sin?
    Why not longer?
   Because after the coming of the Lord and the restoration of all
things, there will be no sin to be found in the universe.
   In whose band is the law even when given from Sinai? What
does this show?
   That even the awfulness of Sinai only emphasizes the abun-
dance of the grace of God, and shows the greatness of God's gift
by grace.
20                   LESSONS IN GALATIANS.

   Is the law then against the promises of God?
   How, then, does it stand in relation to them?
   Under what conditions would righteousness have come by the
law?
   Can the law make alive?
   "The law worketh wrath." Rom. 4 : 15.
   What has the law—the Scripture—done?
   "The Scripture hath shut up all under sin."
   Why hath the Scripture shut up all under sin? Is it to drive
them to destruction?
   "That the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to
them that believe."
   In what condition is a man who does not believe?
   "Before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, shut
up." "He that believeth not is condemned already, because he
bath not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of
God." John 3 : 18.
   Unto what are the unbelieving sinners shut up?
   " Shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed."
   What is, then, the office of the law?
   "The law hath been our tutor to bring us unto Christ."
   What for?
   "That we might be justified by faith."
   What takes place when faith conies?
   " We are no longer under a tutor."
   Why not?
   "For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus."

                              NOTES.

   1. The law coming in at Sinai was not as an antagonist to the
promises of God, but a faithful ally. The law was contained in
the promise to Abraham; for the everlasting inheritance is only
the fruit of everlasting righteousness, which is manifested in the
lives of believers, because the Holy Spirit of promise writes the
law in their hearts, making it their life. The entering of the law,
with all the terrors of the day of judgment, show how great is
this righteousness, and how utterly impossible it is for anybody
to attain to it, and thus gain the inheritance by his own efforts.
Thus the law from Sinai works in perfect harmony with the
promise, by throwing everybody back upon the sure promise and
the oath of God.
   2. "By one man sin came into the world, and death by sin."
Sin is death. We were all "dead in trespasses and sins." If the
law could make alive, surely righteousness would have come by it,
and then there would have been no need of the promises of God.
                     LESSONS IN GALATIANS.                        2.1

But "the law worketh wrath." It shows the sinfulness of sin,
making the offense which seethed trivial, or of which we were
ignorant, to abound, to appear just as it is in the sight of God.
This is a most useful office. The one who will sharply call
our attention to the fact that we are about to walk over a precipice,
or to swallow a poison, and thus give us an opportunity to avoid
the impending destruction, is counted as our friend.
    3. So the Scripture—the law—hath shut up all men under sin,
keeping watch over them, not relaxing one jot or tittle of its
claims. We can not break out of that prison; there is only one
door of escape, and that is faith ill Jesus Christ. The law, instead
of requiring men to keep it in order to be saved, as some suppose;
will not allow anybody to be saved except by faith in Christ Jesus.
The righteousness which is by the faith of Jesus Christ is
witnessed to by the law as well as the prophets. See _Rom.
3:20, 22; Acts 10 :43.

   4. But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a ped-
agogue. " Being justified by, faith, we have peace with God
through our Lord Jesus Christ." Rom. 5 : 1. The law does not
relax any of its claims; but we no longer feel its grip upon us; it
no longer holds us in prison, because, seeking its precepts, we
walk at liberty. Ps. 119: 45. The undefiled in the way walk in
the law of the Lord (Ps. 119 : g and the law being in them, it can
no more be against them. By faith in Christ we are sons of God,
the Spirit bearing witness that we are sons; and so, since we walk
not after the flesh, but after the Spirit, the righteousness of the
law is fulfilled in us. Rom. 8 : 4.




LESSON VI.—PUTTING ON CHRIST; ONE IN HIM.


                        November to, Iwo.
                          (Gal. 3 : 24-29, R. V.)


   " THE law hath been our tutor to bring us unto Christ, that we
might be justified by faith. But now that faith is come, we are
no longer under a tutor. For ye are all sons of God, through
faith, in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as were baptized into
Christ did put on Christ. There can be neither Jew nor Greek,
 22                   LESSONS IN GALATIANS.


 there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and
 female; for ye are all one man in Christ Jesus. And if ye be
 Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise."
    We now come to the close of this most remarkable chapter,
and with the six weeks' study that we put upon it, each student
should have a firm grasp of all its statements. Of course no one
can expect fully to understand the chapter in that time, but we
ought at least to have made so much of its acquaintance that it
is no longer a stranger to us. As usual, review thoroughly from
the beginning before taking up the new lesson, and then study
the verses of the lesson until you could no more forget them than
you could forget your own name.

                             QUESTIONS.

     State the relation- of the law to the promises.
     Why was the law given at Sinai?
     Was the standard of righteousness greater after that than
 before?
    In what state does the law hold all who do not believe? To
what end?
    What, then, is the law to those who do not believe?
    What takes place when faith conies to us?
    What does belief do for us?
    " Ye are all the children of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus."
"As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become
the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name." John.
I : 12. Believing Christ is receiving Him.
    Who have " put on Christ"?
    " As many of you as were baptized into Christ."
   .What, then, can there no more be?
    "There can be neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither
bond nor free, there can be no male and female."
    Why not?
    "For ye are all -one man in Christ Jesus."
    Since we are one man in Christ, what follows?
    " If ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed."
    And what then?
    " And heirs according to the promise." " If children then
heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ." Rom. 8: 17.

                              NOTES.

   1. The law has shut us up in prison as transgressors, yet not
without hope. The door of mercy was open, and as soon as we
believed, we were free; no longer slaves of sin, but sons of God
through faith in Christ Jesus.
                     LESSONS IN GALATIANS.                         23

    2. Belief in Christ includes baptism into Christ. When the
eunuch asked, " What doth hinder me to be baptized?" Philip
replied, "If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest ;" and
the eunuch said, " I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God,"
whereupon Philip baptized him. Acts 8 : 36-38. Jesus said, "He
that believeth and is baptized shall be saved." Mark 16 : 16. It
is thus that he put on Christ.
    3. Bear in mind that it is only by being baptized into Christ
that we put on Christ. It is not the repetition of a formula, nor
the mere application of a water—being buried in it—that con-
stitutes the true baptism—baptism into Christ. " Know ye not,
that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were bap-
tized into His death?" Rom. 6: 3. Baptism into Christ means
the giving up of our lives, being crucified with Him, that we may
live a new life. So it is " no longer I, but Christ liveth in me."
This is a new life, the putting on of "the new man, which after
God is created in righteousness and true holiness." Eph. 4 : 24.
   4. " One in Christ Jesus." " One man in Christ Jesus." There
is but one Man, and that is Christ. God created man in His own
image in the beginning, male and female, " and called their name
Adam,"—man. Gen. 5 : 2. But they fell, and so became less than
men, yes, less than dumb brutes in the knowledge of God's ways;
for, says God, " the ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's
crib; but Israel doth not know, My people doth not consider."
Isa 1 : 3. "Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed
times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the
time of their coming; but My people know not the judgment
of the Lord." Jer. 8 : 7. By faith, and the knowledge of the
Son of God, we come "unto a perfect man, unto the measure of
the stature of the fulness of Christ." Eph. 4 : 13. Christ makes
" in Himself of twain one new man," so making peace: Eph. 2 : 15„
Just as it takes the whole of creation to reveal the whole of the
glory of God, so it takes all the believers in all the world to reveal
the perfect Christ.
   5. "If children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with
Christ." Compare verse 29 with verse 16. There is but one Seed,
and that is Christ. But in Christ all things consist. In Him we
are not many, but one, and He is the One. Therefore we also
form a part of " the seed to whom the promise was made." The
promise is as sure to us as to Christ, and will be ours as soon as it
is His, if we abide in Him. So here again we see that the coming
of the seed to whom the promise was made, embraces the gather-
ing of all the faithful in the kingdom of God.

                 LESSON V11.—REVIEW.


                       November 17, Igoo.


    HAVING studied the whole of the third chapter of Galatians,
it will be well to pause and take a comprehensive view of it.
As a preliminary step, however, read carefully through the first
two chapters, so as to have clearly in mind the foundation of the
third. If you can read and think through those chapters without
the book in your hand, so much the better. Then read the third
chapter through as a whole several times, noting carefully the
connection of all the various parts as you pass along. The fol-
lowing questions may serve as a guide to the study, and may be
suggestive of many more. Be careful, however, not to wander off
into speculation. It is not by wandering, not by dreaming, or

        LESSON VI11.—THE ADOPTION OF SONS.


                        November 24, 1900.

                           (Gal. 4:    V.)



   "BUT I say that so long as the heir is a child, he differeth
nothing from a bond-servant, though he is lord of all; but is under
guardians and stewards until the term appointed of the father. So
we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the
rudiments of the world; but when the fulness of the time came,
God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law,
that He might redeem them which were under the law, that we
might receive the adoption of sons."
   The thoughtful student can not fail to see that there is no real
division between these verses and the closing verses of the third
chapter. That closes with the thought that, having put on Christ
by baptism, we are one in Him, and sans of God, even as -He is, and
so Abraham's seed, and heirs. The chapter proceeds with the
same thought, showing our condition before we thus become
veritable heirs of God through Christ, and contrasting it with our
present state in Christ. It is, therefore, self-evident that the pre-
ceding chapter must be very fresh in our minds before we can
understandingly begin the study of this. Read it through
several times with the Bible before you, if you can not do it in
your mind without the Bible, and then read the words of this
lesson many times and weigh them carefully before going
further.
                            QUESTIONS.

     By being baptized into Christ, what have we put on?
     What do we then all become?
     Being Christ's, whose seed are we?
     And what then?
     With whom are we joint heirs?
     "Joint heirs with Christ." Rom. 8 : 17.       •
     What is true of the heir while he is a child?
     With what is he identical?
     Notwithstanding what?
     Under what is he placed?
                    LESSONS IN OALATIANg.

   Until what time?
   When we were children (under age) in what condition were
we?
   " We also, when we were children, were held in bondage."
   Under what were we held in bondage? -
   "Under the rudiments [elements] of the world."
   What took place when the fulness of time came?
   " God sent forth His Son."-
   How was the Son of God sent forth?
   " Born of a woman."
   In what condition?
   "Born under the law."
   Why was He born under the law?
   "To redeem them that were under the law."
   To what end?
   "That we might receive the adoption of sons."
   Whom does Christ redeem?
   "Them that were under the law."
   And as the result, what do we receive?
   " The adoption of sons."
   Then under what must we also have been?
   Where has the Scripture—the law—shut up all men?
   "The Scripture hath shut up all under sin." "The law work-
eth wrath; for where no law is, there is no transgression." "By
the law is the knowledge of sin."
   Why has it done this?
   "That the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might he given to
them that believe."

                              NOTES.

   1. If these verses are somewhat difficult to comprehend at
first, the comfort which they contain is so much the greater.
Wherever there is difficulty there is treasure; and in these verses
there is a glorious message of mercy for all mankind.
   2. There is no difference between the heir, so long as he is un-
der age, and a bond-servant. That means, just as the apostle says
in verse 3, that the child is in bondage until he comes into the
possession of his inheritance.
   3. We were, as children, "held in bondage under the rudi-
ments of the world." Do not for a moment entertain so dishonor-
ing a thought toward God as that these "rudiments of the world"
have anything to do with Him. "For all that is in the world, the
lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride
of life, is not of the Father, but of the world." i John 2 • 16.
28                  LESSONS IN GALATIANS.


"Take heed lest there shall be any one that maketh spoil of you
through his philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of
men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. Col.
2 : 8, R. V. The "rudiments of the world " are totally opposed
to both the Father and the Son.
    4. Christ redeems us from that to which we were in bondage.
 We were in bondage under the rudiments, the principles, of the
world; then Christ was manifested "to redeem them that were
under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons."
Thus we see that to be in bondage " under the rudiments of the
world," is the same as being "under the law." "Aforetime ye
walked according to the course of this world, according to the
prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the
sons of disobedience; among whom we also all once lived in the
lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind,
and were by nature the children of wrath." Eph. 2: 2, 3. But it
is the law that worketh wrath, for where no law is, there is no
transgression. Sin is bondage, and the law holds us in that bond-
age (compare Gal. 3 : 22), because it will not compromise with sin.
   5. Christ was "born of a woman, born under the law." There-
fore every person born of a woman is redeemed by Christ.
Whether every person will accept the redemption or not, it is for
him to say for himself. Christ has purchased the freedom of
every person. This constitutes the good news of the Gospel.
    6. Note from the text that God considers every person in the
world as an heir, no matter how much he may be the slave of the
world of sin. The heir, while he is a child, differeth noth-
ing from a bond-servant. Even so with us; while we were children,
we were in bondage under the rudiments of the world, yet we were
heirs of all God's possession—of God Himself. This is true of
every man on earth. Everything is for him, if he will but accept
it. Yet there must be a coming back, a change so great that it is
a new birth. Since we differed nothing from bond-servants, we
were bond-servants; in Christ we receive the adoption of sons.
Recall the parable of the prodigal son. During his absence from
his father's house, he was a bond-servant, yet he was his father's
son. So God regards all sinners as wandering prodigal sons. But,
nothwithstanding this, unless, like the one in the Scripture, they
come back to the Father, they will die as slaves.
   7. See how the apostle Paul classes himself with the Galatians.
 We were in bondage ; those under the law are redeemed, that we
might receive the adoption of sons. We may also class ourselves
with them, not only as having been, or even now being, in bond-
age, but also in the adoption.
                    LESSONS IN GALATIANS                        29


   8. Remember that the Galatians were heathen before they
heard the Gospel at the mouth of Paul. All unbelievers are of
course heathen ; but the Galatians were what is generally known
as such. They were among the class that were ready to worship
even Paul and Barnabas, holding them as - gods because of the
miracles that they saw. Acts 14 : 8-13. Therefore, it is again
evident that the things to which they were aforetime in bondage
could not possibly be any precepts given by God ; for they knew
nothing of God.
    9. The question will arise, Is there not reference to a fixed
time in the history of the world, when the work here spoken of
took place? and can it then be an individual experience? To
this it may be answered both Yes and No. Christ died once for
all, but His crucifixion covers the whole time of the fall. All the
manifestation of Jesus in the flesh was but the making visible of
that which has been going on ever since the fall of man. Verses
4 and 5 are parallel with Rom. 5: 6. "When we were without
strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly." It was when
we were without strength that Christ died. At the time of our
greatest weakness, in our lowest state, we come to the cross, to
find the crucified One, and being crucified with Him, enjoy the
strength of His life.
   1o. In this chapter we have simply an extension of the
thought presented in chapter 3. Both speak of the bondage of .
sin, in which the law holds us fast, and of the deliverance. We
were, as all unbelievers are, in bondage under the rudiments of
the world ; but when the fulness of the time came, God sent forth
His Son to deliver us. Even so in the preceding chapter we read
that the Scripture hath shut up all under sin, the law being our
jailer ; but now that faith is come, we are no longer in prison.
But there is no fixed time for faith to come. It is an individual
matter, and comes to each one as he is ready to exercise it.
    xi. "Ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus."
But we do not all become the children of God at the same time ;
for all do not believe at once. Faith is an individual matter. As
soon as faith comes to any man, so that he takes hold of it, he is
free from his bondage ; he is no longer under a pedagogue ; he
is then of age, and ruler instead of servant. It will be seen that
the time "when we were children" (verse 3) is entirely different
from "the adoption of sons" (verse 5). Of course, when we re-
ceive the adoption of sons we are the children of God ; but the
apostle here carries out the figure that he has adopted, and con-
siders the unbelieving sinner as a child yet under age. When we
come of age, when we believe, we become sons indeed ; but the
                     LESSONS IN GALATIANS.

change is wholly in us, not at all in God. The change in us is a
radical one—from slavery to sonship, from death to life—but God
remains the same ; His love toward us is the same first as last.
The Lord loves sinners, and "will not cast off forever." Lain. 3 : 31.
No one can be lost unless he runs away from the Father's house,
and stubbornly stays away, resisting the drawing power of God's
everlasting love and mercy. Jer• 31 : 3.




   LESSON IX.-GOING BACK INTO BONDAGE.


                         December t, 1900.
                          (Gal. q : 6-11, R. V.)




   "AND because ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His
Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father. So that thou art no
longer a bond-servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir
through God. Howbeit at that time, not knowing God, ye were
in bondage to them which by nature are no gods ; but now that
ye have come to know God, or rather to be known of God, how
turn ye back again to the weak and beggarly rudiments, where-
unto ye desire to be in bondage over again? Ye observe days,
and months, and seasons, and years. I am afraid of you, lest by
any means I - have bestowed labor upon you in vain."

   Be sure that you have -the preceding verses clearly fixed in
your mind, before you proceed with these, and then note the con-
nection. If those have been well learned, it will be no task, but-
a pleasure, to include them in the present lesson.

                             QUESTIONS.

  In what condition were we all in former times?
  "In bondage under the rudiments of the world."
  What are the rudiments of the world? See i John 2 : 15, i6;
Eph. 2 :
  With what are they not in agreement?
  What, therefore, did God do in the fulness of time?
                   LEsSON6 IN GALATIANS.

   Hoiv was Christ sent forth?
   For what purpose was He thus sent forth?
   "To redeem them that were under the law."
   What purpose did this serve for us?
   "That we might receive the adoption of sons."
   Since we are sons, What has God done?
   "Sent forth the Spirit of His Son in our hearts."
   What does the Spirit of Christ in our hearts cry?
   What change has therefore taken place?
   "Thou art no longer a bond-servant, but a son."
   And what is every one who is indeed a son?
   At the time when the Galatians were bond-servants, to what
were they in bondage?
   "At that time . . . ye were in bondage to them which by
nature are no gods."
   What was the cause of their being thus in bondage?
   " Not knowing God."
   What was their present condition?
   "Ye have come to know God."
   What is even better than this?
   "To be known of God."
   Yet, in spite of this, what were they doing?
   Turning " back again to the weak and beggarly rudiments."
   What were they deliberately choosing?
   "Ye desire to be in bondage over again."
   What was the evidence that they were turning back to
heathenism?
   " Ye observe days,' and months, and times, and years."
   What fear did the apostle express for them?
   "Lest I have bestowed upon you labor in vain."

                             NOTES.

   i. The Holy Spirit is the seal of sonship. The Spirit is the
agent of the new birth," and is continually sent forth into our
hearts, abiding there as the necessary consequence of our adop-
tion as sons. This is the infallible sign. "if any man have not
the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His." Rom. 8 : 9.
    2. Christ is the Son of God ; both have one Spirit, one mind.
It is by the Spirit that Christ abides in us. In promising to send
the Comforter, the Spirit of truth, He said, "I will not leave you
comfortless ; I will come to you." John 14 : x6—18. Therefore
when the Spirit comes into our hearts, He cries, "Father, Father,"
for it is Christ Himself speaking to the Father. Thus we see
that our relation to God, when we receive the adoption of sons, is
the same as Christ's. It is not we that live, but Christ liveth in
us.
32                   LESSONS IN GALATIANS.

   3. The Hebrew word for Father is Ab, as we have- it in
Abraham, father of many people. The word "Abba" is a
strengthened, emphatic form of this word. "Abba, Father " is,
therefore, the same as " Father, Father," with emphasis.

   4. There is a difference between a bond-servant and a son.
Read John 8 : 31-36. The slave can not be an heir ; he can.not
own anything, not even himself. He has no control of himself,
much less of anything else. But the sons of God must be as, free
as He is, for they are heirs, not only of all that God has, but of all
that He is ; they are heirs of God Himself. They are rulers with
Him, set "far above all principality, and power, and might, and
dominion." - Compare Fph. 1 : 17-21 and 2 : 1-6. As sons of God
we are masters, not slaves. No enemy can have power ,over the
soul whose life is hid with Christ in God. Luke 10 : 19.
   5. Compare verse 8 with Eph. 2 : II, 12. That is all the com-
ment that need be made upon the state from which the Galatians
were delivered on accepting Christ. Compare also verse 9 with
verses 6 and 7 of chapter I. The same wonder is expressed in
both places, and for the same reason. What a strange thing it is
that people after having a glimpse of heaven will turn back to the
world ; after having known freedom in God will deliberately put
themselves under the burdensome bondage of sin.
   .6. Do not fail to note that the "rudiments " spoken of in verse
9 are the same as those mentioned in verse 3—the rudiments of
the world. We have already learned what they are. What are
they, and where do we find the statement? What is friendship
with this world?
   7. Compare verse 10 with Deut. 18 : 9-12. The observation of
times, that is, the practise of augury, a common thing among the
heathen, was expressly forbidden by the Lord. Note in Isa.
47 :Io-14, with m argin, the vanity and wickedness of observing
months.
   8. Some will ask, "How could it be that the Galatians were
going back into heathenism, when the false brethren' who were
perverting them were Jews? " The answer is easy. That they
were relapsing into heathenism is evident from the fact that they
were turning back to the things to which they had formerly been
in bondage ; and they had formerly been heathen. They never
were Jews. Remember that they were being led by false breth-
ren into "another gospel," which was not a gospel at all. They
were being led away from Christ. The real Gospel is "the power
of God unto salvation to every one that believeth." The false
gospel,—the substitution of one's own works for faith in Christ,—
                     LI:SSONS IN GALATIANS.                       33

is the power of man, not to salvation, but to destruction ; for there
is no help in man. Now when men lose their faith in Christ,
they have no power to hold them to God, and they invariably
drift back into their former habits of life, no matter who their
teachers may be. So the Galatians, being taught by Jews to put
their trust in their own works, were naturally taking up the
works to which they had previously been accustomed.
   9. Observe that Paul expresses no concern for himself, but only
for the Galatians. His fear was for them lest his labors had been
in vain for them. He did not mourh lest he had wasted his time
upon them; he did not regret the time and strength he had spent,
but only feared lest they should lose the benefit of it.




       LESSON X.—THE BLESSEDNESS LOST.


                         December 8, Iwo.
                          (Gal. 4 : 8-18, R. V.)


   " AT that time, not knowing God, ye were in bondage to them
which by nature are no gods; but now that ye have come to know
God, or rather to be known of God, how turn ye back again to the
weak and beggarly rudiments, whereunto ye desire to be in bond-
age over again? Ye observe days, and months, and seasons, and
years. I am afraid of you, lest by any means I have bestowed
labor upon you in vain.
    " I beseech you, brethren, be as I am; for I am as ye are. Ye
did me no wrong; but ye know that because of an infirmity of the
flesh I preached the Gospel unto you the first time; and that which
was a temptation to you in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected;
but ye received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.
Where, then, is that gratulation of yourselves? for I bear you
witness, that, if possible, ye would have plucked out your eyes
and given them to me. So then am I become your enemy, because
I tell you the truth? They zealously seek you in no good way;
nay, they desire to shut you out, that ye may seek them. But it
is good to be zealously sought in a good matter at all times, and
not only when I am present with you."
34                   LESSONS IN GALATIANS.


    There are in this lesson a few expressions rather hard to be
understood, but we need not be bothered over them. Do not waste
time in conjectures as to what they mean, but extract the nourish-
ment from that which yields it the most readily. In studying the
Bible, always work in the line of least resistance. Let what you
know be the revealer of that which you do not know. You may
hold the difficult passages in mind, scrutinizing them carefully to
see what connection they have with what precedes and follows,
but never indulge in speculation concerning them. The specula-
tive opinions of the best man that ever lived are of no value what-
ever in studying the Bible, and are not to be considered for a
moment. It is what the Bible says to us, and not what somebody
thinks about it, that is of value. It may be that some in studying
this lesson will find no difficulty whatever; their minds will be in
such condition that every expression can be received and under-
stood at once. If so, it will be a cause of thanksgiving to God.
But if we do not see the force of everything, that does not prevent
us from grasping the general thought.

                           QUESTIONS.

   In what state were the Galatians before their conversion?
Compare verse 8 with Eph. 2 : II, 12.
   What did they at that time serve?
   With whom had they become acquainted?
   Yet to what were they turning again?
   Compare the apostle's questions, " How turn ye again," etc.,
with Jer. 2 : II-13.
   What words in verse 9 indicate that the Galatians were taking
up some of their old idolatrous customs?
   What were some of them?
   Where do we find any of these things spoken against?
   What fear did the apostle express?
   How did he appeal to them?
   What did he say they had not done to him?
   To what experience did he refer them?
   Under what circumstance did Paul first preach the Gospel to
the Galatians?
   How did they receive him at that time?
   How did they regard his infirmity?
   How devoted were they to him?
   Yet how did they now seem to be regarding him? Verse 16.
   Who had changed, he or they?
   What did the new teachers desire to do to them?
   Where is zeal a good thing? At what time?

                              NOTES.

    I. The apostle did not feel personally affronted because the
Galatian brethren had turned away from that which he had taught
them. It was wholly a matter between them and God, and he
was solicitous only for their welfare. They were departing from
God, not from Paul. They were injuring only themselves. The
true servant of God will not feel elated when men accept the
Gospel at his mouth, nor cast down when they reject it. Truth
does not belong to any man, and therefore no man has any busi-
ness to have personal feelings over the way in which people regard
it. The failure to recognize this fact has led to untold persecution.
Men have felt as though they were personally insulted if people
did not believe what they taught; and the most of the persecution
that has existed in the world has been the resentment of offended
dignity.
   2. All the best translations have " because," or its equivalent,
in verse 13, instead of " through," as in our ordinary version.
What a flood of light upon Paul's labor among the Galatians we
get from these few sentences! He was in great bodily affliction
and physical pain when he first preached the Gospel in Galatia.
Not only so, but that infirmity was the cause of his preaching the
Gospel at that place. It is evident from his statement that he was
obliged to stop in Galatia on account of physical infirmity, but
instead of spending the time looking after his own comfort, he
took advantage of the circumstance to preach the Gospel; and he
evidently did it with the more vigor because of his infirmity. See
2 Cor. II : 23-30; 12 : 7-1o. What a marvel of the power of Christ
in man that can use even his times of greatest physical weakness
as an occasion for accomplishing the greatest work ! Here, also,
we see another proof that the Gospel does not depend upon man,
but on God. It is not of the flesh, but of the Spirit.

   3. Comparing these verses with Gal. 3 : 1-5, we shall see that
the Galatians had had no ordinary experience. Paul's preaching
was " in demonstration of the Spirit and power " (1 Cor. 2 : 2-4),
just because he had no power of his own. Christ was set before
them so vividly that they could see Him crucified; the Spirit was
administered to them, and received, miracles were wrought among
them, expressions of rejoicing in God were heard from all, and
they had suffered persecution for their faith. All these things are
distinctly stated in this epistle; see if you can recall them.

   4. While the Galatians received the truth directly from Christ
crucified, they did not despise the humble instrument that the
Lord used. They received him as an angel of God, even as they
36                   LESSONS IN GALATIANS.


would have received the Lord. • Christ said: " He that receiveth
you, receiveth Me." Paul's affliction was evidently such that it
made him personally very unattractive. Compare verse 14 with
2 Cor. io : ro. That the seat of the difficulty was the. eyes, is ap-
parent. But this made no difference with the Galatians. The
blessed Gospel he brought to them transfigured him in their eyes,
and so it did in reality; for real beauty is of the soul, not of the
body. " The beauty of the Lord " was in Paul. The gracious
words that he spoke more than made up for his unsightly appear-
ance. No sacrifice was too great for the Galatians to make, and
this they would do as unto the Lord.
   5. By the memory of all the blessedness and joy of their first
faith, Paul appeals to the Galatians. He contrasts their former
experience with the present. Where is now the blessedness?
Where are their joyful testimonies of praise? Ah, the new teach-
ing has changed all that! They could tell by their own experi-
ence that there was a vast difference between the Gospel which
they received through Paul and the false gospel which they were
now receiving.
    6. The kingdom of God is " righteousness, and peace, and joy
in the Holy Ghost." Rom. 14 : 17. Persons who have been truly
converted know what joy and peace filled him at that time. But
most people seem to have the idea that that joy can not last; that it
must necessarily pass away, as they take up the monotonous round
of daily duties, and these stretch out into years. Their Christian
life becomes a sort of treadmill experience. That is a great mis-
take. Jesus said, " These things have I spoken unto you, that My
joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full." John
15 : 11. The path of the just shines more and more until the per.
feet day. Christ never leaves us nor forsakes us; He abides with
us to the end, and in His presence there are rest and fulness of joy.
Ex. 33: 14; Ps. •16:11. The giving of the Holy Spirit is the
anointing with " the oil of gladness." God gives " the oil of joy"
in place of mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heavi-
ness. Isa. 61 : 1-3, DD. The fountain of life.from God never runs
low. If, therefore, you find that your joy in God is growing less
in your experience, do not rest content in any such condition.
Know that any teaching, any doctrine, that does not bring glad-
ness into your heart, and give you strength and courage for .daily
life, is not the good news of Jesus.

       LESSON XI.—BONDAGE AND FREEDOM.


                        December 15, 1900

                          (Gal. 4 :19-26, R. V.)



     "My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ
  be formed in you, yea, I could wish to be present with you now,
 and to change my voice; for I am perplexed about you. Tell me,
 ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? For it
  is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and
 one by the free woman. Howbeit the son of the handmaid is born
 after the flesh; but the son of the free woman is born through
  promise. Which things contain an allegory; for these women are
 two covenants; one from Mount Sinai, bearing children unto
  bondage, which is Hagar. Now this Hagar is Mount Sinai in
  Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem that now is; for she is in
  bondage with her children. But Jerusalem that is above is free,
" which is our mother."
    This much-discussed portion of Scripture is really the simplest
 and most direct of any part of this epistle. There is no possibility
 of misunderstanding it, if we but give heed to what is said, and
 hold ourselves to it. Of course it is necessary to be familiar with
 the incident in Abraham's life, to which the apostle refers; so we
 should refresh our minds by reading Gen. 16; : 15-21; Heb.
 rI : 11. We have this week only a part of the lesson that the
 apostle draws from the life of Abraham, and so must wait until
 next week to get the complete view; but if the verses that
 we have before us are thoroughly mastered, we shall find no
 trouble. See that not a thought escapes you.

                             QUESTIONS.

    In what affectionate manner does the apostle address his
 hearers?
    In what words does he show his intense anxiety for them?
    For what was he so burdened in their behalf?
    What did he desire?
   • In what state was he concerning them?
    What direct question does he ask? What were some desiring?
 This being so, what is intimated that they were not hearing?
38                   LESSONS IN GALATIANS.


   What is written concerning Abraham?
   Of whom were these two sons born?
   How was the son of the bondwoman born?
   How was it with the son of the free woman?
   What does this history contain for us?
   What are these two women?
   For which covenant does Hagar stand?
   To what does that covenant bring forth?
   What is this Hagar? To what does Hagar, or Mount Sinai,
answer?
   in what state.is old Jerusalem? Who are in the same condition
with her?
  What about the Jerusalem which is above? Whose mother is
she? Being free, to what must she bring forth?

                             NOTES.

   I. "My little children." Very affectionately does the apostle
deal with the erring Galatians, not as a matter of policy, but be-
cause he loves them as a mother loves the children whom she has
brought forth, in pain. In his labor in the Gospel, the apostle
Paul gave ,himself, his own life, for souls, even as Christ did.
Whoever labors in that way, will never deal harshly with any
wanderer.
   2. The Galatians were in a doubtful position. They wanted
salvation, yet they were choosing destruction. They were de-
liberately putting themselves under the law, in a state of con-
demnation, and that because they were ignorant of the law. Com-
pare Gal. 3 : ro. The man who sets himself to get righteousness
by the law, places himself under the curse, just as surely as the
man who deliberately rejects it and tramples upon it.
   3. "Do you not hear the law?" The law certainly speaks loud
enough. Read Ex. 19 : 16-24. It spoke only death. By itself,
outside of Christ, it is only the ministration of death. D. very
feature of the giving of the law from Sinai, every word, every
lightning flash, and every thunder bolt, together with the fire and
the earthquake, said most plainly, "There is no righteousness,
but only condemnation and death, to be obtained by the works of
the law." The inheritance of righteousness is not by the law, but
by promise. Compare Gal. 3 : 18.
    4. This was demonstrated in the case of Abraham. He made
a great mistake and attempted to fulfil God's promise. A son had
been promised him,—a true free-born son who could be his heir.
It had been expressly stated that a servant could not be his heir.
                    LESSONS IN GALATIANS.                       39

Gen. 15 : 2-4. Nevertheless, he harkened to the voice of Sarai,
instead of to the Lord, and took Hagar, Sarai's Egyptian bond-
maid, by whom be had Ishmael. But since Hagar was a bond-
servant,•a slave, Ishmael cotild be nothing else. So Abraham had
gained nothing. Afterwards Isaac, the child of promise, was
born. He was free, and could inherit all that Abraham had. The
history is so plain that no one can misunderstand it. The appli-
cation is equally plain.
   5. These two women, Hagar and Sarah, represent two cov-
enants, known respectively as the first and the second, the old
and the new. One originates at Mount Sinai, the other in the
New Jerusalem above. In the first one the people promise to keep
the law; in the second one God promised to write the law in their
hearts by His Spirit. The first one can give nothing but bondage,
condemnation, and death. The other gives pardon, justification,
and life. The old Jerusalem is in bondage, together with all that
look to it for help. Mount Sinai itself—the law for which it stood
as the emblem—could never give freedom. It only with thunder
tones warns people not to depend on works for righteousness, and
drives them back to the promise and the oath of God.
    6. Jerusalem above is free, and is the mother of all who are of
the faith of Abraham; " for he looked for a city which hath
foundations, whose builder and maker is God." Heb. II :10.
Here we may come and be adopted as free-born citizens. " For
ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that
burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,
and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice
they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to
them any more (for they could not endure that which was coni-
manded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall
he stoned, or thrust through with a dart; and so terrible was the
sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake). But ye are
come unto Mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the
heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,
to the general assembly and church of the first-born, which are
written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits
of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the mediator of the nevi.
 covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better
 things than that of Abel." Heb. 12 : 18-24.
                           QUESTIONS.
   What does the history of Abraham, Sarah, Hagar, and their
children contain?
   What do the two women stand for?
   Whence does the one covenant come?
   To what does it bring forth?

    Who represents this?
    To what does she answer?
    In what condition is the old Jerusalem?
    What of Jerusalem which is above?
    What relation does it sustain to true Christians?
    What is written concerning it? Where is it written?
    How was Isaac born?
    What of the " brethren " in Christ?

the bondwoman and her son? How sure is this? Why is it to
be done?
    Whose children are those who know God? Since the bond-
woman brings forth children to bondage, what must he the con-
dition of the children of the free woman?
    What exhortation is therefore given us? In what are we to

     LESSON X11. THE SON ABIDETH EVER."

                       December 22, 1900.
                      (Gal. 4 : 25-31; 5 : 1, R. V.)


    "Tins Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to the
Jerusalem that now is; for she is in bondage with her children.
But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is our mother. For
it is written,
            Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not;
            Break forth and cry, thou that travailest not;
            For more are the children of the desolate than of her
               which hath the husband.
    "Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.
But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that
was born after the Spirit, even so it is now. Howbeit, what saith
the Scripture? Cast out the handmaid and her son; for the son
of the handmaid shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.
Wherefore, brethren, we are not children of an handmaid, but of
the free woman. With freedom did Christ set us free; stand
fast, therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage."
                     LESSONS IN GALATIANS.                      41

    The word "handmaid," which is used in the revision, is mani-
festly in contrast with "free woman "—so that it is the same as
" bondmaid " and " bondwoman " in the common text. The Greek
word from which it is translated is defined as "a young female
slave."
    Study these verses, beginning with verse 21, most carefully.
Read them over a hundred times, if necessary, in order to see the
connection and force of every word. Do not study for contro-
versy, nor to find out how to meet an opponent, but that you may
find what instruction and comfort there is for you personally. It .
is only when we are anxious to do God's will that we learn of the
doctrine. John 7 :17.
                                 NOTES.
      I. Do not forget that Hagar was a slave, and as such could bear
  children only to bondage. Ishmael was not the heir of Abraham
  until Isaac was born, becoming a slave afterwards; he was always
  only a bond-servant. His mother could never bear any other
  than bond-servants, even though Abraham himself were their
  father. Even so the covenant from Sinai which is Hagar and the
  old Jerusalem, could never bring forth free sons of God. There
' was never a time when the covenant of Sinai could do more than
  work condemnation and wrath. From its first moment it was-an -1
  instrument of death, and all who held to it were in bondage—the
  slaves of death.
      2. "Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above."
  James r : 17. Only the Jerusalem that is above can give freedom.
  That is the city for which Abraham looked. He did not come
  to Mount Sinai, but to Mount Zion, to Christ, the Mediator; and
  those who do likewise are heirs. All who look to the Jerusalem
  that now is for blessings, or who expect any blessing whatever in
  connection with it, are in bondage to the old covenant, which was
  never designed to give freedom.
      3. Verse 27 is a quotation from Isa. 54 : r. From it we have a
  key to much of the prophecy of the Old Testament, for we see
  that all the prophecies concerning the glorious restoration of
  Jerusalem, and the gathering of her scattered children, refer to
  the New Jerusalem which cometh down from God out of heaven.
   Rev. 3: 12. Jerusalem is now desolate; none of her children are
  within her walls, for Christ has not yet come to take them there.
  Soon the seed will come, to whom the promise was made, and
  then it will be seen that Jerusalem has a host of children, for
  they will then Come to their inheritance. Then the place which
  old Jerusalem occupies will be found altogether too small, and a
   much larger place will have to be prepared. Isa. 49 :
   From among the Gentiles will her children be gathered. See
   also Acts 15 : 14-17.
42                  LESSONS IN GALATIANS

     4. Isaac was the child of faith, the child of promise, born of
the Spirit. If we truly believe, then we are born again, "born
 from above" (John 3 :3, margin), and, like Isaac, are the children
of promise, having the New Jerusalem for our mother. We may
expect tribulation and persecution from the flesh, even from our
own flesh; but that is only for our encouragement. "If ye were
of the world, the world would love his own; but because ye are
not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, there-
fore the world hateth you." John 15: 19.
     5. "Cast out the bondwoman and her son." Does this seem
like" a hard commandment? Do not regard it so; it conveys a
most glorious promise. It is a personal word to each one of us.
The bondwoman is the covenant of human works, and the son is
our own sinful flesh, which only shows itself the more sinful the
more we try to do the works of the law. It must be cast forth,
for only free-born sons can inherit the promise. "Every one that
cornmitteth sin is the bond-servant of sin. And the bond-servant
abideth not in the house forever; the son abideth ever." John
8 : 34, 35• Who gives the order? It is God, who said, "Let there
be light," and the light was. If we recognize Him as Creator,
we shall see that His command, "Cast out the bondwoman and
her son," is proof that it shall be done, and we shall be delivered
from every phase and every trace of bondage. It is the procla-"
illation of liberty to the captives, the opening of the prison to
them that are bound. Isa. 61 : I, 2.
    6. The word has already been spoken and the freedom is ours.
With the psalmist we may say, "0 Lord, truly I am thy servant;
I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid; thou hast
loosed my bonds." Ps. 116 : 16. Whoever comes to the Lord,
acknowledging himself to be God's servant, is by Him acknowl-
edged as a son, alive from the dead. Being sons, we shall abide
in the house of the Lord forever.
    7. "Brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of
the free." No matter though we have been bound hitherto, we
are sons of the free woman, because the proclamation of freedom
has gone forth to all. The bonds are loosed, but we may not
have known it. All we have to do is to arise, shake ourselves from
the dust of the dungeon, and loose ourselves from the bands of
our neck. Isa. 52 : I, 2. Don't stay in slavery after the emanci-
pation has been proclaimed. Liberty has been proclaimed to all
the inhabitants of the land, to the sinners of the Jews as well as
to the sinners of the Gentiles; to professed Christians, who find
a yoke of bondage still on their necks, as well as to the reckless
transgressor.
    8. With freedom Christ did set us free, even with His own
freedom. "The glorious liberty of the children of God," is a
present reality. The inanimate creation yet groans under the
                    LESSONS IN GALATIANS.                        43

bondage of corruption, and must until the time of restoration, at
the coming of the Lord, but it will at that time only be delivered
to share the glorious freedom which the sons of God now enjoy.
If we are truly sons of God now—and we are if we truly believe—
we are joint heirs with Christ, and as free as He is; that is, as
free from sin and from all the power of the enemy. This being
the case, why should we ever allow ourselves to be entangled in
the yoke of bondage?
   9. Here is a serious personal matter for the consideration of
each one. Christ said, "If ye continue in My word, then are ye
My disciples indeed; and ye shall know the truth, and the truth
shall make you free." John 8 : 31, 32. He is the truth. John
14 : 6. " If the Son, therefore, shall make you free, ye shall be
free indeed." John 8 : 36. Are you free indeed? Do you know
your freedom? Are you free from all bad habits and from every
form of slavery? Are you master of the world, the flesh, and the
devil? Does the devil flee from you at your command? Have
you victory over the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and
the pride of life? If not, you do not yet know the truth, for the
truth makes free, and the freedom is nothing less than that here
spoken of. This and nothing less is the freedom that Christ, the
Son, the Truth, gives us. Do not complacently rest in the
correctness of the doctrine you hold. No one may be able to
pick a flaw in it; yet .if you have not this freedom, you do not
know the truth, much less can you teach it to others. To be thus
free is not a hard requirement, but a glorious gift offered freely
to all. Take it, and stand fast in it.




                LESSON XI11.—REVIEW.

                        December 29, 1900.
                         (Galatians 3 and 4.)


    THE length of time we have been studying the first four chap-
ters of Galatians, gives us an average of four verses of the epistle
each week. Since it is the book itself that we have been studying,
and our attention is supposed to have been riveted to the text
first of all, it surely ought not to be too much to expect that even
those with the least time, and who are the least accustomed to
study, should have these four chapters firmly fixed in their
44                  LESSONS IN GALATIANS.

minds. It is these weaker ones that have been constantly kept in
view in the preparations of the lessons. The aim has been to
have them so short and simple that none could have any reason-
able excuse for not learning them. Yet the book is so deep, so
rich and full, that the most active minds can find an abundance of
material for study in every lesson. It is not what we have been
over, but what we retain and can carry with us, that does us good;
so all earnest students will welcome a halting place, where they
can take a brief survey of the work done. The following ques-
tions, which are not designed to take the place of any questions
the live teacher may ask, will suggest more topics that can be
gone into in detail in an hour, but it is taken for granted that the
details have already been sufficiently considered to enable the
student to summarize. The answer to every question may be
found in the text, or in sonic portion of Scripture that has been
given a prominent place by the side of the text.

                           QUESTIONS.

    Under what circumstances did the Galatians receive the
Gospel?
   How vividly was it set before them?
    What was their early experience?
    What change had suddenly taken place?
    How had it been brought about?
   From what were they turning away? To what?
    \Vhom were they forsaking? Then whom were they then
accepting?
    Were they consciously apostatizing from the faith?
   How had they begun their Christian life?
   How were they now seeking to carry it forward?
    With whose experience was their early experience identical?
    What were they therefore to know?
    How did God from the beginning propose to justify the
heathen?
    What proof of this did He give?
   In what words was the Gospel preached to Abraham?
    Who, then, and only who, are blessed?
    Who are under the curse? Why?
    What is the curse of the law?
    How and by whom has redemption from the curse been
wrought?
   Upon whom does the blessing come? Whose blessing do the
Gentiles get through Jesus Christ?
   To whom were the promises made? How were they con-
firmed?
                   LESSONS IN GALATIANS.                      45

   What about the unchangeableness of the covenant?
   What was promised in the covenant?
   Could the giving of the law affect the terms of the inher-
itance? Why not?
   Why, then, was it given?
   What is the relation of the law to the promises made to Abra-
ham and his seed?
   How long will it have this office to fulfil?
   Why will it no longer have that office when Christ comes and
establishes the inheritance?
   In what condition does the Scripture—the law—hold all men?
   Then what hope is there for them? For what purpose does
the law so emphatically remind men of their bondage under sin?
   How is freedom obtained?
   What do we put on? How? What do we all then become?
   Whose freedom do we then obtain?
   How do we then stand related to Abraham and the inheritance?
   Give a summary of the fourth chapter.
   What two states are presented?
   In what condition were we all by birth?
   What is it to be in bondage to the principles of the world?
   How does the world stand as regards God?
   How are we delivered from the bondage?
   What case is given as an illustration of the two classes?
   If we believe and accept the Spirit, whose children are we?
   Who is our mother?
   What was the only thing the old covenant could ever do for
anybody? In what did it consist? Whence did it originate?
   Whence does the new covenant proceed?
   What place did Abraham look to?
   Where do we come, if we believe God's Word?
   What must first be cast out? What is the bondage?
   What comfort is there in the command, " Cast out the bond-
woman and her son "?
   What, then, is the exhortation given?
   Have you the freedom of Christ?

        A NEWLY ILLUSTRATED EDITION OF


THOUGHTS FROM THE MOUNT
      OF BLESSING

    Before issuing editions of this soul-inspiring
volume in England and Australia, as well as in
several foreign languages, it was thought best to
prepare an entirely new series of illustrations which
will more faithfully emphasize the beauties of the
text.
    These engravings have been carefully prepared
and the entire book has been reset, and is now

    Battle Hymn of the Kingdom
                  SLIGHTLY IMPERFECT



             for 35 Cents
    Until our present stock of imperfect books is
gone, we will send a copy of Battle Hyvin of the
Kingdom to each one subscribing to the Bible
Students' Library and sending us 35 cents for same
—only 10 cents extra.
    The regular price of this booklet is 25 cents, and
the imperfection in the lot is so slight that but few
will notice it. This price will be given only in the
above-mentioned way.
    A subscriber to this Library is entitled to six dif-
ferent numbers of the Library. During the past
year these six numbers aggregated 79 cents, yet
our subscribers have gotten it all for 25 cents. We
can not say what will be issued in this series the
coming year, but it will be carefully selected liter-
ature that will repay your subscription price.
    This offer is good to both old and new sub-
scribers. The booklet will be sent to one address,
and the Library to another, if desired.

proofs, said



"One beautiful thing about this

        That conclusion is emphatically true, as everyone
who has had the privilege of reading a single chapter

        It treats upon the work of the Holy Spirit, and as
one who read it said,



"It is a BOOK OF ACTS and
not a volume of resolutions"

       Get it. Read it. You will thank us for recom-
rdending it to you, and in turn you will recommend it to
