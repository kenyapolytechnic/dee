                             NOTES.

    I. Evidently the women were at first sight somewhat startled at
the brightness of the Lord's messenger, but his assuring words
gave them comfort. This incident well illustrates the surety of
God's promise that when terror overtakes the wicked, it will not
come nigh those who make the Lord their fortress. Ps. 91 : 1-8.
This was especially true in the case of the women, to whom the
angel said, " I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified."
    2. After Peter's cowardly denial of the Lord on the night of
His betrayal, this word to send the message direct to Peter was an
assurance that the Lord had already forgiven his wicked act. It
is also one of the strong evidences of the Lord's long-suffering
toward those who now commit folly under great temptation.
    3. From this statement of the Saviour it is very evident that
the thief did not ascend to the Father with Jesus on the day of
the crucifixion. See Luke 23 : 43. The " to-day " of the promise
must therefore refer to the time of making the promise, rather
than to the time of its fulfilment. This would naturally be read
 from the text were the cpmma after the word " thee " to follow
the next word, which might be done without violence to inspira-
 tion, since punctuation points are no part of inspiration, but a
 modern invention.

LESSON H.-MEETING WITH THE DISCIPLES
                           April 11, 1900.

greet them? Verse 34.
   20. What did the two report to the disciples?
Verse 35.
                            READING.

   " Desire of Ages," chapter 83.
                              NOTES.

    i. It seems from the conversation that these disciples were
anxiously desirous to learn, if possible, what these events all
meant to their hopes of their future. Jesus did then as He does
now for every anxious inquirer,—draw near to give them that for
which their. soul longed,—a knowledge of His plan of salvation.
    2. The English word " fools " as represented to have been used
by the Saviour on this occasion was not one expressing lack of
sense, but rather a gentle reproof for their forgetfulness of Scrip-
ture declarations that they had been taught to cherish, which,
if remembered, would have saved them from their perplexity.
The sense of the text would have been as well preserved had it
been translated, "0 thoughtless man." The Revised Version
reads, "0 foolish men."
    3. They "constrained" Him, that is, pressed Him beyond meas-
ure. They had not been satisfied with His brief words so cheer-
ing, but urged His presence. This desire for His presence caused
Him to tarry with them, and gave Him opportunity to make
 Himself known to them. Their experience in this line may be
 ours, and will be when we become as importunate as they.

   " Desire of Ages," chapter 84.

                             NOTES.

   I. The reason for their terror was that through unbelief they
were unprepared to meet Jesus. This incident revived in their
minds Vac superstitious view which the Jews had received from
the pagans in regard to spirits.
   2. "Jesus, in giving the disciples their first commission, had
said, I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven;
and whatsoever thou [referring to responsible men who should
represent His church] shalt bind on earth shall be bound in
heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed
in heaven.' In renewing the commission of those to whom He
had imparted the Holy Ghost, He said, Whosesoever sins ye
remit, they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever sins ye
retain, they are retained.' These words conveyed to the dis-
ciples a sense of the sacredness of their work, and its tremendous
results. Imbued with the Spirit of God, they were to go forth
preaching the merits of a sin-pardoning Saviour; and they had
the assurance that all heaven was interested in their labors, and
that what they did on earth in the spirit and power of Christ,
should be ratified in heaven."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol. 3, ft.

                             NOTES.

   1. This is another illustration of the fact that in obeying the
Lord's commands there follows a reward which meets the demand
of the hOur. When the Lord said to the nobleman, "Go thy
way; thy son lived'," on returning home he found his heart's
desire. When Jesus out on the deep sea said to Peter, " Come,"
obedience to the command provided power with which to walk on
the water. The law of friendship with Christ is still the same.
John 15 : 14. To obey implicitly is the first step into the Lord's
confidence, and toward final reward.
    2. It seems strange that the other disciples did not recognize
14                      LIFE OF CHRIST.

 Christ, as did John. But as soon as Peter was told that the ap-
 parent stranger was the Lord, his old-time enthusiasm seized
 him. How like many of to-day, who do not of themselves discern
 the Lord in His dealings toward them, but have to be told by
 others that it is He, before they manifest any interest in the
 Lord's presence!
    3. This question was to refresh Peter's mind regarding what he
 had said on the night of the betrayal, that, although all the other
 disciples should deny the Lord, he never would; that he loved
 Hint enough to go to prison or to death with Him, even though
 the other disciples should forsake Him. So the Lord reminds us
 frequently, after our failures, of our boasted love, not by direct
 reference to the boasts made, but by some other test which will
cause us to r(flect on the failures.
    4. Peter seemed to feel by the repetition of this question
that Jesus doubted his love, and that he was being placed
in a wrong light before his brethren. But the Lord was simply
trying to impress upon him a lesson of human weakness, and the
necessity of dependence upon divine strength in order to carry
out the trust about to be committed to him. As Peter had thrice
denied the Lord, after professing more love for the Lord than his
brethren possessed, so three times the grave question was asked,
"Lovest thou Me more than these? " Oh, that we might learn
this important lesson before, by word or deed, we deny the Lord
once, even, in the presence of His enemies!
    5. This change is remarkable because it shows that Christ not
only distinguished between the older and younger members of
His body, but that He in this case called attention to the younger
ones first, indicating that they should find a prominent place in
the labors of those who work for the Master. It is also remark-
able that the word "feed," used in verses 16 and 17, conies from
two different originals. The one in verse 17 means to give pasture,
and the other conveys the sense of tending as a shepherd. Not
only then were the flock to be fed, but also tended, and cared for
in every need.
    6. So it is new; many take their eyes from their own work, to
watch the course of others, as though it were a part of their duty
                           LIFE', OF WRIST.                                     13

to know all the particulars of a fellow-laborer's calling. But the
answer to Peter's question is a good one now for all inquisitive
ones, "What is that to thee? follow Thou Me."
   7. This an illustration of how unsafe it is to draw deductions
from what the Lord says, and make them the basis of a belief.
The admonition of Paul to Timothy, teonsider what I say," is
worthy of much consideration in these days of speculation as to
the meaning of plain statements in God's Word.

                                NOTE.
   Although Jesus had told His disciples plainly that He was
soon to go away, but would replace His personal presence with the
Holy Spirit, they could not as yet so far divest themselves of the
common idea that the Messiah was to reign a temporal king, as to
anticipate with satisfaction the coming of the Holy Spirit to them.
At this distance how strange it all seems, and yet they were no
blinder respecting that truth than many of us now are on other
important subjects.

                          •   NOTES.

    1. " With one accord.", This is a condition on which the pres-
ence of the Father and Son is guaranteed to the church. The
prayer of Christ for the disciples was " that they may be one "
even as the Father and Son are one. The Spirit, which would
guide them "into all truth," would enable them to keep the com-
mandments of God. Jesus says, " If a man love Me, he will
keep My words; and My Father will love him, and We will come
unto him." By this union the world would know that Jesus
Christ had been sent of God, and that God loved them. John
17 : 22, 23.
    2. " Cloven tongues." This was the form in which the Holy
Spirit visibly appeared to the waiting disciples, indicating the
special endowment which was essential in proclaiming the gospel
to the world:
    3. It could no longer be truthfully said that the apostles were
unlearned men, even from the world's standpoint. They had been
about three years under the tutelage of Christ, who had in every
contest baffled the wisdom of the learned ones; and now they
received the gift of tongues, such as no man possessed or could
                          LIFE OF CHRIST.                          21


  have acquired in any of the schools of the world. " The Holy
 Spirit had done for them that which they could not have accom-
 plished for themselves in a lifetime. The'y could now spread the
 truth of the Gospel abroad, speaking with accuracy the language
 of those for whom they were laboring. This miraculous .gift was
 the highest evidence they could present to the world that their
  commission bore the signet of Heaven."—Spirit of Prophecy, vol.
  y, fi. 267.
•      4. The pouring out of the Spirit was the "promise of My
  Father " and the " power from on high " mentioned in Duke
  24 : 49 and in Acts I : 3. See Acts 2 :33.
       5. " David is not ascended into heaven." This declaration,
  together with the statement in verse 29 that " he is both dead
 and buried," gives us positive proof that the dead lie in the grave
  until the resurrection. If David were still conscious, he could
  not be dead. But if it be insisted that he had a dual life, and that
  only his body died, then the statement that he " is not ascended
  into the heavens " would class him among the conscious wicked
  dead, wherever that might be. But such a conclusion is fore-
  stalled by " the last words of David," which were spoken by the
  spirit of prophecy. See 2 Sam. 23 : 1-7.
                         LESSONS
                                  ON THE


Sermon on the Mount
    NOTE. — It is quite impossible in six lessons to adequately cover
a portion of Scripture consisting of III verses, in which many
times a single verse contains suggestion for an hour's study ; but
as not even one whole lesson was given to this interesting portion
of our Lord's teaching when we passed over the early part of the
Gospels, it was thought both proper and profitable to use the last
six lessons in this quarter in the further study of this wonderful
sermon. What a blessing it would be if those who study these
Lessons would commit these three chapters to memory !
   For the one " help " above all others, apart from the Word,
"Thoughts from the Mount of Blessing," and chapter i6 in
"Spirit of Prophecy," vol. 2, are recommended.

    1. The location of the Mount of Beatitudes (the meaning of
 which is blessings) is not certainly known. It is somewhere near
 the Sea of Galilee. The Lord would have us mind the teachings,
 not the mountain. The instruction was spoken first of all to His
 disciples gathered around Him, and beyond them to the great
 multitude eager to hear. They are written for us upon whom
 the ends of the World are come.

   2. It will be noticed by the careful student that these
" blesseds " (or " happys ") are pronounced not upon special
classes who are naturally humble, meek, pure, etc., but upon dis-
positions which every soul by grace may acquire. In fact, each
" blessed " marks a step forward and upward in Christian char-
acter; they are telescopic, so to speak, all of them being contained
in the truly humble, or " poor in spirit." The thoroughness of
the first step will mark the degree and rapidity of progress in tilt
subsequent steps. The very beginning of Christian character b
to have a sense of one's own utter unworthiness and nothingness
apart from God. This is to acquiesce in what God says to us in
such scriptures as Jer. 17 :49; Rev. 3: 17. Neither are the bless-
ings and promises all to be put off to the future. God gives the
" earnest " of the very greatest of them here.
   3. Hunger and thirst are longings for that which will meet our
needs. Every longing desire for something satisfying to heart
and soul is from God; its perversion to evil things is of Satan,
Both hunger and thirst become strong passions, sometimes break-
ing through and overruling every other sentiment. But only one
thing can meet the soul's longing,—Christ.
   4. "The pure in heart" see God even here as do no others.
They see Him in all His created works, marred though they are
by sin. They see Him in His Word. In that better, sinless world,
"they shall see His face; and His name shall be in their fore-
heads." Rev. 22 : 4.

                                                    Lev. : 2.
Verses 45, 48.
                              NOTES.
    i. Jesus came to fulfil, or fill up, both prophets and law. To
fulfil the prophets is to be and accomplish what they predict. This
will not be done till the new heavens and earth are ushered in.
Law can be fulfilled only by doing it. Fulfilling prophecy makes
it history. But fulfilling law can not, in the very nature of things,
destroy or abolish the law. See Gal. 6 : 2. Christ by doing,
obeying, the law showed it to be honorable, and His teaching
magnified it by bringing out its spirituality. Isa. 42 : 21. Now
one jot (yod, the smallest letter in the Hebrew) or tittle (a small
point of a letter which served to distinguish one letter from
another) "shall in nowise pass from the law till all things be
accomplished" (R. V.), till the new heavens and the new earth in
their glorious eternity shall have passed away. Isa. 51 : 6, 7.
    2. The righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees in Christ's
time was a mere outward observance of external forms. It was
literally "the righteousness of the law," doing the outward thing
because the law said so, not because love prompted it. This
might gain the praise of men, but it would never he a passport to
the kingdom of. God, either here or hereafter.
    3. Not -"by them of old time," but, as in the margin and
Revised Version, "to them of old time." Jesus did not con-
demn the law, but desired that His disciples should know its
depth.
    4. All this was in the commandment, "Thou shalt not kill."
The greater sin includes all despising, all contempt, all hatred,
                    SERMON ON THE MOUNT.                            29


 which would lead to murder. "Without cause," the R. V. omits.
 " Raca," an expression of contempt; "thou fool" (Hebrew Illoreh),
 an expression of condemnation; "hell fire," "fire of Gehenna."
     5. Not only must we cherish no hatred, but we must do what
 we can to remove our brother's estrangement if we know such
 exists. But here great wisdom is needed. Before going to
 another, we should have good evidence that he really holds a
 grievance. Too often it is the case that he who would carry out
 the Saviour's instruction imagines that some one holds aught
 against him, and thus, because of the many occasions, is kept
 constantly at work trying to make peace with his brethren. But
  no effort should be spared, where one is known to be seriously out
 of harmony with us, to remove, if possible, the cause of separation.
  If we are sinning against God, the law is our adversary. Agree
  with it before it is too late.
     6. Adultery includes the cherishing of lustful thoughts.
  If our thoughts are pure, our words and acts will be pure.
  Unchaste language, words and expressions that suggest evil
- thoughts, should be scrupulously avoided. They are corrupting

  in their influence upon others, and give evidence of a corrupt
  heart; "for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
  speaketh." Matt. 12 : 34.
      7. " Causeth thee to stumble," of the Revised Version, is plainer
  than "offend thee." We should be willing to sacrifice what is as
  dear as the right hand or right eye, rather than sin against God.
  He wants the whole man clean. What is true of the individual is
  true of the church. Matt. 18 : 8, 9; I Cor. 5 :6, 7.

   1. "They have their reward " here and now. They are looking
to men, and they gel what men have to give.
   2. " Vain repetitions," among which would be included the
names or titles of Deity repeated over and over in an irreverent
form. Some prayers from really earnest persons would seem
blasphemous in cold print. The name of Deity is used as one
would use the name of a common man in a narrative. Our Lord
forbids this, and enjoins reverence.
   3. Not the Lord's prayer, but a model prayer which Jesus
taught His people for all ages. Note how much it includes:
(I) The address; (2) our relationship to Him; (3) our needs;
(4) our character and relation to our fellows; (5) our future safety,
with the closing ascription, omitted from the Revised Version,
but eminently scriptural. "Father" is the home name, an
affectionate and an endearing relation; "our Father," implying
brothers and sisters and uniting in one family all God's children.
"Hallowed," holy should the name and character of God be
regarded. This could not be done without becoming like Him.
    4. "Thy kingdom come." Where?—Here, and, first of all, in
our own hearts. No man ever truly prays the prayer if he does
not submit to God's law and desire that God shall rule supreme
in his life. It must be personal, " Thy will be done " in me in
the earth.
    5. "Our daily bread," spiritual as well as physical. Man
thinks he must eat daily of physical food to maintain strength
and vigor. Is not daily feeding upon the Word as necessary for
 moral strength and vigor? "Manna from heaven falls fresh
 every eve" for God's people now as well as anciently.

                                                        questions.
     I. WHERE does Jesus warn us nut to place         I Tim. 6:17-19.
our treasures? Verse 19.
     2. Where is a safe place of deposit? Verse 20.
     s. What is the result of the deposit of our
treasures in any place? Verse 21.
     4. What is the light of the body? What is
the effect of having the attention undividedly
and clearly centered upon God? Verse 22.
See note I.
     5. What is the result of an evil or perverted
vision? If that which alone can bring us light is
perverted, what will follow? Verse 23.
     6. How is this principle further illustrated?   James 4 :4:
                                                         :8; 4 : 8.
How many different masters can we serve?
Verse 24.
     7. What practical conclusion does Jesus draw
from this? What is the most important?
Verse 25. See note 2.
     8. What illustration does He give of trust and   Job 38:41;
                                                        Ps. 104 : 27, 28.
confidence? How are we regarded as compared
with the fowls? Verse 26.
     9. How much will our thoughts add to our
stature or change our age? . Verse 27.
    30. For what else arc we not to be anxious?
What example of trust and beauty is given here?
Verses 28, 29. See note 3.
                    SEkMON ON THE MOUNT.

   It. What may we conclude from these lessons
of God's care for us? Verse 3o.
   12. What, then, should not be anxious ques-
tions in our lives? Verse 31.
   13. Of whom are such questions characteristic?
What great Provider knows all our temporal
needs? Verse 32. See note 4-
   14. What iS our first duty? What is our x Kings          3: 11-13.
Father's promise? Verse 33. See note 5.
   15. What, then, is our duty as regards future
evil? . What evil is always sufficient? Verse 34.
See note 6.
                               NOTES.
   I. The body, with its passions, is naturally dark; its light comes
alone through the eye. The single, clear eye gives correct ideas.
The perverted eye distorts all outward things to the dark body.
So if our spiritual vision is single (seeking only God's glory),
clear (trusting Him as He declares Himself to be), His light will
flood the soul and enlighten the dark body. But if this vision is
perverted by sin and selfishness, it will further pervert the
naturally base passions and make blacker the natural darkness
within.
   21' The word " therefoTe " shows this verse to be.a conclusion
from verses previous. Jesus anticipated that souls would be
tempted to believe that we can not get clothing or food unless we
serve the world or ourselves. His effort in all this instruction is
to lead men to the higher service alone, that of God. Whatever
we do, do it as unto God, and• leave results with Him. "Take
no thought," is better expressed it the Revised Version, " Be not
anxious." The word means anxious, tioubled, worried thought.
So also in verses 27, 28, 31, 34.
    3. "Consider the lilies;" they teach many lessons. Growing
in the soil or decay of earth, they turn their faces to the light,
and God through them transmutes the base soil of earth into
glorious beauty. So let God's will be the first, and our character
will adorn whatever physical clothes God may in His providence
give
34                   F_;12.1110N ON '1'11F.; 1\1011Ni'.

    4. It is the Gentiles, nations of the world, who seek such
things, whose hopes are only temporal, earthly. The'children of
God should. have higher objects.
    5. This lesson does not in any way indorse laziness. The
Christian will be diligent and industrious. Rom. 12 : II; I Thess.
4 : 11; 2 Thess. 3 : 10-12.
    6. Borrow no evil of the future. God gives us to-day strength
for to-day's duties, trials, sorrows, evils. We can borrow no grace
for future troubles. How foolish it is, then, to borrow a trouble
which we can not meet! The day brings sufficient evil and care,
but there is always grace for the day. God is a present help in
trouble.



      LESSON V.—JUDGING, ASKING, LIVING.

                                                          Side texts to be
                                                            studied with

     1. WHAT admonition does our Lord give us as
to judging or condemning? Verse 1.
     2. Why should we not condemn others? ROM. 2: I;
                                                  James 4: II, 12.

     3. What questions does He ask which teach
us our own fallibility? Verses 3, 4. See note I.
     4. What positive injunction does He give?
Verse 5.
     5. What prudence should we show in the Prov. 9: 7, 8; 23 : 9.
dissemination of God's blessings? Verse 6. See
note 2.
     6. How are God's blessings to be obtained?
Verse 7.
     7. What assurances does He give? Verse 8.
See note 3.
                    SERMON ON THE MOUNT.


     8. What appeal does Jesus make to mere
earthly affection? Verses 9, io.
     9. What comparison does He make? Verse i 1. Luke II :9-13.
    io. What disposition should we cherish toward Lev. 19:
all? By what is this injunction enforced? Verse
12. See note 4.
    11. What way are we enjoined to take? Verse Luke 13: 24.
33, first clause.
    12. Why should we take the straight gate and
narrow way? Verse 14.
    13. Why should we shun the broad way and
gate? Verse 13.
    14. What is said of the number that enter each
gate? Verses 13, 14.
                              NOTES.
   1. Beholding, gazing at a fault in others, turns the attention of
others to the thing looked at. It leads to judging, condemn-
ing. "Mote," a chip, a splinter, in contrast with a great beam.
How can a man with a beam of wood in his eye take from another
eye a mere splinter of wood? The sin of sitting in judgment on
others is one of the greatest of sins. This judging does not refer
to proper church discipline, where the Spirit guides. i Cor-
inthians 5. But be sure in such case that it is in reality done
in Christ's name and Spirit.
   2. The figures are those of casting the flesh of the sacrifice
unto dogs, and precious seed pearls, resembling grain, to hogs,
which, undeceived, trample them underfoot and rend you. Do
not cast the precious truth of God before those who have no
desire to hear it. They must he reached in some other way.
   3. He who .asks to receive, must not ask amiss. James 4 :3. It
must be to God's glory. He who seeks to find, must seek with all
his heart. Jer. 29 : 13. And he who knocks successfully, will'
have his whole soul in the knocking. He must long for admit-
tance. Note that this asking must refer not only to ourselves,
but we should ask for those whom we would naturally condemn.
   4. The sum of the right treatment of all men is embodied
in the -Golden Rule. How would we have the Chinese, the
36                  SERMON ON THE MOIJNT.


Spaniard, the Filipino, the opposed to us in religion, our rivals
in race or nation, treat us if our circumstances were reversed?
That is the way for us to treat them. If the Golden Rule had
always been carried out, there never would have been a union
Df church and state, religious prosecution or persecution, or
compulsory religious laws. All labor troubles would be settled
by its practical application. All animosity of union men towards
non-union would be banished before it. All neighborhood and
family troubles would be no more. What is to hinder Christians
from reducing it to practise? Note also that all this instruction
in Christ's sermon is the magnifying of the law

   13. What came upon his house? How was it
affected? What was the reason? Verse 25.
   24. To whom did Jesus liken the disobedient
hearer? Verse 26.
   15. How did the storms affect his house?            Isa. 28: 17, 18;
                                                         Eze. 13 to-16.
 Verse 27.
   16. How did the words of Jesus affect the
people? Verses 28, 29. See note 4.

                               NOTES.

    I. Sheep's clothing, peaceable professions, have always been
characteristic of false prophets. Their mission is either to lull
the church to sleep in sin or to lead it away into error. For
the former purpose they cry, "Peace, peace " (Jer. 6 :13, 14; Eze.
13 :     r), and for the latter, "Lo, here is Christ, or there" (Matt.
24 : 23-26). We may know them by their fruits, those fruits
measured by "the law and the testimony." Isa. 8 : 20.
     2. To call Jesus " Lord" is to say that we are His servants, doing
His service, obeying Him. The real test is, therefore, obedience.
"Why call ye Me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I
say?" Luke 6 : 46.
     3. " Iniquity " is lawlessness, breaking of law. Let it be noted
that the real test of discipleship is obedience to the will of God.
 Verse 21. It matters not what has been prophesied in Christ's
 name, what demons cast out, what miracles wrought, if those
38                  SERMON ON THE MOUNT.


who do these things are against God's law, they must be banished
forever from Him. This is a complement to Matt. 5 : 17. If God
knows us, we have His Spirit and do His law.
   4. The words of Christ were not uncertain, equivocal, or
hypothetical. He was filled with the Word of God; God's law
was in His heart; He spoke authoritatively, from His own fulness.
He would have His children so full of that same Word, He would
have that law so inwrought into their very lives, that when they
speak it would be "as the oracles of God." I Peter 4 : 11. His
words only will carry weight.

                  The subject of the union of church and state be-
             comes more interesting as the days go by for a great
             prophecy upon the subject is being most marvelously
