     Is Religious Liberty a
     Dead Issue?
     The following from the pen of Zider Uriah Smith, which appeared
               in the Review of Sept. 26, 1899, is right to the
                          point on this question:—

         " If there is any Third Angel's Message at all, there is
    a religious issue connected with it; and that issue is whether
    Church and State shall be united in this country. . . .
    The prophecy plainly declares that the iniquitous thing
    will be done here. . . . Until the message, 'therefore,
t                     1
    has done its work, and is closed, this can never become a
t   dead issue or a back number.
         " There are, to be sure, a number of periodicals that can
    be relied upon as stanch defenders of the true principles
    of religious liberty        Yet there is only one that is de-
    voted, specifically and aggressively, to the work of making
    known these principles from the standpoint of the prophetic
    crisis that is before us; and that is the American Sentinel.
         " Be not deceived. This issue is not laid upon the
    shelf. . . . There is a call and field for every power and
    every agency that will stand for the right. Let the Amer-
    ican Sentinel be sustained."
         What do you say aboUt it, brethren and sisters? Do
    you say " Let it be," or " Let it be sustained"? Will you
    take hold at once and do your best to help in its circulation?
    NOW is the time for active work. Let us hear from you.

                                NOTES.
    1. In eating the Passover the participants seated themselves at
a table, and the question of place or position would naturally
arise, and if several. had a desire for the place of honor, or first
place, and expressed it, strife would surely result. This explains
how the strife arose which is mentioned in Duke 22: 24, and this
was followed by the instruction recorded in verses 25-30, and the
example of humility and the teaching of Christ found in John
13:1-2o. This precious instruction, accompanied by the Saviour's
example in washing His disciples' feet, was designed to give them
a correct view of true greatness, and prepare them for the service
which was to follow.
    2. It may be noted that the basin, the water, and the towel were
all at hand as necessary parts of the Passover accompaniments.
The two disciples sent ahead to make arrangements for the cele-
bration of that feast, without specific instruction, provided the
bread, the wine, the water, the towels, and all the vessels used on
that occasion.

                               NOTES.
    I. The Passover had more significance than merely to point to
the death of Christ as a sacrifice for sin. Its very name is derived
from the act of the avenging angel passing over God's people in
Egypt—those who had the blood of the sacrificial lamb on their
door-posts—when the first-born of the rebellious Egyptians were
being slain. As the deliverance of Israel from Egypt to dwell in
the promised land was a type of the final deliverance of God's
people to inherit the land promised to Abraham's seed, so the
fulfilment of the Passover will not be complete until God's people
reach the final consummation.
    2. It seemed necessary to indicate beforehand the definite
course matters were to take, in order to confirm the disciples in
their faith, and so fortify them against the heresy that all these
events were accidental. Christ wished His disciples to understand
that He knew the hearts of all men. John 2: 25.
    3. The Passover lamb which they had just eaten was a type of
Christ, and would meet its antitype when He should expire on the
cross. The Lord's Supper, which was then instituted, in which
they partook of the bread and the fruit of the vine, was to con-
tinue until the fulfilment of the mission of Christ. When He
comes the second time, and gathers His disciples around the board
at the " marriage supper of the Lamb," then Christ will drink of
 the new fruit of the vine with His disciples, in the kingdom of
 God. Matt. 26:29.

    " Desire of Ages," chapter 73.

                               NOTES.

    i. At first thought it seemed strange that, with so long a
tutelage under the Saviour Himself, so many should have quibbled
about how His promises were to be fulfilled. Yet many to-day are
almost, if not quite, as dull students as they, notwithstanding
great opportunities for present enlightenment. Their difficulty
arose from a gross misconception of the nature of Christ's rule,
supposing it to be an earthly reign upon the Jewish throne, after
the fashion of worldly kings, while many now, though having
discarded that view, mistake the nature of Christ's reign in the
heart, and so doubt His ability or purpose to fulfil His promise of
power, because the heart is not fully yielded to Him, thus barring
out simple faith.
    2. Used in connection with what goes before it, this text shows
that as Jesus only acted and spoke as the Father in Him prompted,
so in His going away and leaving His disciples with the same
power dwelling in them that had moved Him in everything, they
ought to rejoice in the thought of having the power direct from
One who is above all. It is, therefore, the privilege of every be-
liever to have the same power dwelling within him by which
Jesus moved, spoke, and did the miracles that characterized Him
as the Son of God. This is what the reception of the Holy Ghost
in its fulness will do for every child of God. Its reception is not
a Mere theory, but a blessed condition, through which God works
to reveal to the world the mysteries of His kingdom, that the
sinner may choose its reign as infinitely superior to that of Satan's.
See John 14:12.

                             READING.

   " Desire of Ages," chapter 73 ; " Spirit of Prophecy," vol. 3,
chapter 6.
                            N OTES.
    1. The abiding in Christ is being as closely connected with
Him as the branch is to the vine, which draws all its life and
growth through the vine from its roots. This makes the branch
so much a part of the vine as to be of the same nature; and, in
fact, it is but an extension of the vine itself. To remain in that
connection, the branch must bear only the fruit of the vine, which
is the product of the life of the vine. To have such close connec-
tion with Christ is to receive life from God through Him, and to
bear only that fruit which is the product of His life,—in short, to
be the extension of Christ in humanity.
    2. To abide in Christ, then, is to abide in His love; not simply
to accept forgiveness Through His love, but to make His love our
own, and live in it. This is the transforming power of Christ,
which changes life's ambition, and directs the thoughts from a self-
center to seek the upbuilding of the distressed and wretched. This
is the fruit of the heavenly vine, which its connected branches
must certainly bear.
    3. How different is a friend from a servant! No servant is
made a confident of family secrets; he has not the freedom of the
family circle, does not participate in its united joys, and is not
consulted in matters of family interest. He is just a servant,
nothing more, doing what he is told, regardless of results. But a
friend is welcomed in the family circle, is made a bosom compan-
ion, and given the place of honor as a guest. Matters of importance
are confided to him, and his counsel sought. His is an enjoyable
position. How much more so when we are counted friends of the
Lord Jesus !

     "Desire of Ages," chapter 73.
                                     NOTE.
   Before this time the disciples had asked favors of Jesus in their
own names, and for themselves; now everything was to be changed.
The Holy Spirit, the representative of Jesus, was to be in them,
prompting all their motives. Self was to be relegated to the back-
ground. Nothing was to be asked for simply to please self, but
Jesus was the One to be pleased. Hence the name of Jesus was to
be used, as though the petitioner would ask only for Jesus' sake,
that He might receive the coveted blessing to be used in them.




               LESSON VI.—IN THE GARDEN.
                             February lo, r9oo.


                        On Mt. Olivet, A. D. 31.
          (Matt. 26: 36-47 ; Mark 14 : 32-43 ; Luke 22 : 39-47 ; John 18 : I.)
                                                                    Side texts to be

                                                                        questions.
    1. AFTER instituting the Lord's Supper, where
did Jesus go with His disciples? John 18 : I.
    2. Arriving in the garden, what did He request
them to do? Matt. 26:36.
    3. Were any of them privileged to go beyond Matt. 4 : 21 ;
                                                     17 : I, 2.
that point? Verse 37. See note I.
    4. In  the sorrow of His heart,  why did  Jesus
want these three disciples with Him? Verse 38.
See note 2.
    5„ Having gone a little farther, what did Jesus Luke 22 :41.
do? Mark 14 35-
    6. In what spirit was this prayer offered?
Matt. 26 :39.
                         LIFE OF CIIRIST.

     7. How earnestly did Jesus pray on this occa-   Heb. 5:
sion? Luke 22 :,44.
    8. In what form did relief come to Him?          Matt.     11.
Verse 43.
     9. Upon going to the three disciples, how did   Luke 22 : 45.
He find them? Matt. 26:4o.
   10. When they were awakened, what injunction      Mark 14 : 26-31.
did He give them, directing His words specially to
Peter? Verse 41.
   11. After these solemn words, What did Jesus

                              NOTES.
    i. The three disciples thus taken to the interior of the garden,
to there witness Christ's passion, had also been the chosen wit-
nesses of His transfiguration: Of all others, these alone were
permitted to behold the power of Christ in raising the ruler's
daughter from the dead. Luke 8 : 51.
    2. In this trying hour, where all the agony of His life was cul-
minated, Jesus evidently desired these beloved disciples near, just
the same as we desire the presence of dear friends in our great
struggles with spiritual foes. Besides, He was desirous that they
might witness in the soul agony which drew the bloody sweat
from His face, something of the love wherewith He had loved
them, that they might be prepared to go forth to the world enabled
to proclaim that love in its fulness&

   3. Had Peter overcome the power of darkness specially mani-
fested during the season of agony endured by Christ, he would
have been fortified against the temptation which Christ knew
would surely follow His arrest in the garden that night. But, like
many now whom the Lord would prepare to stand in the great
temptation soon to come upon all the world (Rev. 3 : 1o), he lost
the necessary power to withstand the trial by letting his will-
power be controlled by a weakness of the flesh. See, again, Matt.
26:41.

    I. BEFORE entering the garden where Jesus
was, what sign had Judas given his companions,
by which they might recognize Christ? Mark
14:44.
    2. Who were those in company with Judas? Acts 1 : 16.
What did they carry with them? John 18:3.
    3. Knowing their object, what did Jesus do?

   "Desire of Ages," chapter 74; "Spirit of Prophecy," vol. 3,
chapter 7.
                               NOTES.

    1. It is a remarkable thing that, in the midst of all His danger,
Jesus did not for a moment forget to care for His disciples, and so
 the only favor asked of His captors was that His disciples might
 retain their liberty.
    2. Annas had been appointed high priest in A. D. 7, by the
 Emperor Quirinius, but because of his constant intrigue and
-unwearied plottings, was deprived of his office in A. D. 14, by
 Valerius. He, however, had the privilege of seeing his five sons
 successively raised to the same office. Caiaphas, being son-in-law
 to Annas, gave way to the influence of the latter to such an extent
 that the father-in-law really ruled matters in the office of high
 priest.

     4. As Peter was entering the house, who spoke
to him? What was his reply? Verse 17.
     5. Under what circumstances did Peter again,
deny his Lord? Verse 18.
     6. What was Peter's object in thus associating

priest's question? Verses 20, 21.

to Jesus? Verse 22.
    IO. How did Jesus receive such treatment?
Verse 23.
    It. What was then done to prove evil against                John 2 :15-21.
Christ? Mark 14: 55-58. See note 3:

   12. Did the Jewish officials find in these wit- Matt. 26: 6o, 61.
nesses the evidence they desired? ' If not, why
not? Verse 59.
   13. To what, therefore, did the high priest Matt. 26 :62.
resort for evidence? Verse 6o.
   14. Upon Jesus not deigning to reply, what did
the priest then say? Matt. 26: 63.
   55. Did Jesus answer this legal demand? V. 64. Mark 14:62.

                             READING.

   " Desire of Ages," chapter 75; " Spirit of Prophecy," vol. 3,
chapters 8 and 9.
                               NOTES.

   1. The fact that all the notables of the Jewish church were
assembled at the house of the high priest awaiting the arrival of
the prisoner, shows that the plan of His capture and trial was well
understood, and carried out to the letter.
   2. Peter evidently played a false part. In mingling with the
servants, he sought to hide his identity. In this effort he placed
himself on Satan's ground, and subjected himself to unnecessary
temptation. Had he remained with John, and not tried to
appear a disinterested spectator of the all-absorbing affair, those'
present would have known his relations to Christ without a ques-
tion. But when the questions were asked him in a way to show
contempt for• his Master, Peter was not fortified. From this in-
stance we can learn that it is better to let our true colors be
displayed from the first.
   3. This is but an example of how wicked men can pervert the
words of another in order to prove a case. How careful we should
be, therefore, in stating the words of another !

chapter 9.
                                 NOTES.
   i. The decision of the meeting at the house of Caiaphas was of
no binding force. The charge of blasphemy there decided against
Christ must have a legal decision from the council of the nation
in order to convert it into a charge of treason, and so hold the
prisoner in the meshes of the civil law. Jesus is, therefore,
hurried into the presence of the national council as soon as its
members can be gotten together.
   2. It must have been humiliating for Judas, hard as he was, to
go before the very persons to whom he had shortly before shown
himself willing to sell his Master, and there confess that he had
betrayed an innocent person. What a lesson for those now who:
so readily become accusers of their brethren ! Many such may yet
have the same confession to make as did Judas, but, let us hope,,
with some prospect of correcting the wrong.

   i. The "common hall," or public prtorium, was the head-
quarters of the Roman military governor, and was located, in time
of peace, in some one of the best buildings of the city, as decided
by the choice of the governor.
   2. Cyrene was in North Africa, a province of Libya. That
part is now known as Tunis. A large colony of Jews had settled
there centuries before, and there were large numbers there still.
Simon, though a Jew, was recognized as a foreigner on whom they
could shift the burden of the exhausted One, whose slow motions
were delaying the progress of the impatient guards.
   3. This was a bitter, stupefying drug of myrrh (Mark 15 : 23),
but named gall (Matt. 27 34), because of its bitterness. Jesus,
however, refused that which would in any way becloud His
faculties, even though it might relieve His excessive pain.

by railed on Him, who else caught up the strain?

   "Desire of Ages," chapter 78; "Spirit of Prophecy," vol. 3,
chapter ro.                    NOTES.
   1. It would seem from John's record that the garments of
Christ were divided just enough to give each soldier one part, and
that there were made of these but four parts. This suggests the
thought that but four soldiers attended His crucifixion. Besides
each of these receiving one part of Christ's nether garments, the
seamless coat was awarded to the one to whose lot it fell by chance.
   2. This was a thin, sour wine, the usual beverage of the Roman
soldiers. It was offered to Christ in the moment of His dying
thirst as the only drink at hand.

LESSON XI11.—THE BURIAL AND RESURRECTION.
                                   March 31, Iwo.

from these heavenly visitants? Verse 6.
                              READING.
   "Desire of Ages," chapter 8o; "Spirit of Prophecy," vol. 3,
chapter 11.                     NOTES.
   1. Crucifixion was not contemplated under the provisions of
the Mosaic law, yet men were sometimes hanged on a tree after
death, that by being thus exposed they might be a warning to all
beholders, but they were by no means to be left hanging after
sunset, lest the land be defiled. Were three corpses to remain on
the cross over Sabbath in plain sight of the temple and holy city,
great commotion would follow, because of the strict religious
scruples of the people, and might result in disaster.
    2. It is said that the custom of breaking the legs of crucified
culprits just before sunset, in order to comply with the Jewish law,
was so that they could not get away after being taken from the
cross, inasmuch as they were rarely if ever found to be so soon
dead. Mark 15 44.
    3. Joseph was a "counselor," which probably means that he
was a member of the great council of the Sanhedrin. Luke
23 : 50,51. Probably no one but a member of that court would
 have dared ask such a favor of the procurator, who alone could
give permission for the removal of the body. Joseph had secretly
 believed in Christ for some time, having but one friend to whom
 he had divulged his feeling's, namely, Nicodemus. Together they
 had decided to brave indignation, and give the Saviour a decent
 burial.

PACIFIC PRESS PUBLISHING COMPANY




The Desire       Ever since the publication of the large
                 subscription edition of this remarkable
of Ages          book, there has been a call for a smaller
                 copy without illustrations and at a low
  price. Just such a book was issued October 3o, 1899.
  It contains all the reading matter of the subscription
  book, including the exhaustive Scriptural and General
  Indexes, but no illustrations except a frontispiece.
  Its size is 5 x7$ inches; its pages, 1042. It is a
  "trade book," that is, it is not subject to a subscription
  book discount to agents. The prices are as follows:
  Cloth, $1.50; Full Leather, round corners, $2.00.


A Friend in         The object of this book is to help
                    people to discard a harmful diet by
the Kitchen         presenting before them a better one.
                    This is well done in a series of about
  400 carefully selected and tested recipes, into the
  preparation of which flesh meats do not enter. In
  addition to being a practical cook-book, it contains
  much valuable information about foods, food com-
  binations, food values, time necessary to digest various
  foods, etc., which will be appreciated by every house-
  wife. It is well bound in waterproof cloth. Price, 6oc.

Pagan Counterfeits                 It may be hard to believe
                                  that there are really anti-
in   the Christian Church Christian beliefs cherished
                                  by the Church to-day, but
      a perusal of this intensely interesting pamphlet will
      convince a candid mind that such is the case. In
      addition to this, the author treats upon Papacy and
       Masonry in a way that is well calculated to awaken
      people to the danger to this country in the stealthy
      tread of the former, and to the baneful influence of
      the latter. 187 pages. Price, 25 cents.


The Seal        of God     Has the Lord a seal or an out-
                           ward sign by which His true
and Its Counterfeit followers may be known? If
                           so, what is it? Has Satan pre-
   pared a mark intended to counterfeit that seal? If
   so, what is it? These important questions form the
   basis of the 32-page illustrated tract, title of which is
   given above. It deserves careful study and wide
   circulation at this time when the counterfeit seal is
   being so generally accepted as the genuine.
                                     Price, $2.00 per zoo.


The Return There are many scriptures which
             clearly indicate that there will be a
of the Jews class of people attracted to some one
                       portion of the earth, and the object of
      this tract is to determine the class to which reference
      is made. The present agitation concerning the return
      of the Jews to Palestine makes peculiarly appropriate

N atural Food The increasing    demand for a scrip-
                   tural setting forth of the principles
of Man             connected with the natural diet
                       of man, together with a series of
     recipes enabling the user to dispense not only with
     meat but all animal productions such as butter, milk,
     eggs, etc., as well, has brought this most excellent
     little pamphlet into the field. It is divided into
     three parts. Part One is written by the editor of
     the Signs of the Times, under the heading, "Man's
     Primitive and Best Diet." Part Two, by Mrs. Flora
     Leadsworth, gives directions for the preparation of
     more than 15o thoroughly hygienic dishes. Part
     Three, by J. R. Leadsworth, M. D., treats upon
     "Food for the Sick." 96 pages. Price, 25 cents.


Jesus Died         A sweet-spirited invitation to Christless
                   souls to consecrate themselves to their
for You            Saviour without delay. Especially
                   good for mission work, in that it is
     easily understood, is brief, and breathes forth a mes-
     sage warm from the Throne of Love. 8 pages, illus-
     trated cover. Price, 50 cents per zoo.

      Individuality of God's Love
We have in prospect another manuscript by Professor Rine

and manifests Himself to, each one of His children in
contradistinction to the mass. This will be issued as a
          number of the Apples of Gold Library.

               Christian Science
Elder A. 0. Tait has been giving much study to the sub-
ject of Christian Science and kindred last-day delusions,
and we hope soon to present the results of his researches
in book form. It is an important group of subjects, and
we look for the book to have a very large circulation. Its
price will probably not exceed 50 cents, and it may be issued
            in paper covers also at about 25 cents.

              House We Live In
The well-known writer for children, Mrs. Vesta J. Farns-
worth, has sent to us manuscript for a book on the im-
portance of knowing the materials and functions of our
own bodies. It is for home reading, and intended to
assist mothers in teaching children how to care for their
bodily dwelling, and the evil effects of narcotics and stimu-
lants. A few of its twenty-six chapter titles will indicate
   its character better than an extended description:—

     Houses and Temples          Our Kitchen
     Our Frame                   Food and Fuel
     Proper Care of the Frame    Bath Room
     Walls of Our House          How the House is Heated
     The Cupola                  Some Wonderful Windows
     Our Telephone System        Music Room

It is all told in a dialogue form which makes it extremely
interesting, while the appropriate series of illustrations
now being prepared will add much to its attractiveness as.
         a book for the children. Price, about Sr.00.
