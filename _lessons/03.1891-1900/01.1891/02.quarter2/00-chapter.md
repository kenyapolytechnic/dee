    The life of this great preacher of Florence. The scene of the book is of course that
land of romance and song and heroism, Italia, where the Apostle Paul and other wit-
nesses of the truth finished the " good fight of faith." The little volume is a graphic
sketch of the most prominent events of the preacher's life and experience, the monasti-
cism of the fifteenth century, the iniquities thatprevailed, the political influence of Savon-
arola, his trial and death.

Jottings from the Pacific No. 2. This volume is for the Tonga Islands what " jottings
from the Pacific No. 1" is for the Fijian and Samoan Groups. But there is no sameness
between the two. The islands, people, customs and products are sufficiently varied to
make another volume equal to or exceeding in interest the first.
                LETTERS FROM THE HOLY LAND.
     This book carries us from the newly discovered and explored Pacific to that of the
oldest of all lands in story and song—the land of Palestine. It is very instructive, illus_
trating many customs and practices, peoples and things, so different from those cif ou t-
own land. The reading of the book will make much more intelligent and interesting the
study and reading of the Word of God. It contains a large number of illustrated chapter
headings and full page cuts.
              AMONG THE NORTHERN ICEBERGS
Lays before us an entirely different scene. From the tropic heat of the Coral Islands of
the Pacific, from the sunny land of Italy, and the historic and mild little Palestine, we are
taken to the northland where King Frost reigns supreme, releasing only for a little time,
now and then, his icy grip that he may more securely fasten upon those helpless mariners
who wander within his domain. The book gives most interesting sketches of the Arctic
expeditions of England and our own land in the nineteenth century. The rising genera.
tion will appreciate the reading of this account second only to those who read the graph*
narrations at the times of their occurrence. It is an interesting and instructive book.
    Each volume is fully illustrated and contains ,6o pages. The set, therefore, has nearly
1,000 pages, and will certainly be a valuable addition to any library and especially to that
of a young person.

                        NOTES.
   1. In order to become perfectly familiar with any
epistle, it is necessary to understand as much as pos-
sible of the circumstances attending the writing of it,
and the people to whom it was specially addressed.
In studying these lessons, the student's aim should be
to acquire not only such a knowledge of the epistle
under consideration that be can think through it as
a whole, giving an outline of each chapter, but also
            EPISTLE TO THE PHILIPPIANS.


to become acquainted with the circumstances of the
people connected with it, so that he can in imagina-
tion live them over. Help in this line will be given
in the notes.. The thorough teacher will find in the
notes suggestions for many questions that are not
written in the lessons. He will also find it expedi-
ent sometimes to expand one_ question into two or
three. Care should be taken, however, not to carry
this so far as to depart from the direct line of the
lesson.
   The principal facts which throw light on the epis-
tle to the Philippians are found in the epistle itself,
in the sixteenth chapter of Acts, and in 2 Gor. 8 : 1-5.
in Luke's narrative we learn that Philippi was "the
chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony."
Acts 16 :12. By the term "colony" is meant that
 the city was founded, or at least occupied, by Roman
citizens, who had gone there under the direction of
 the Roman Government, and who possessed all the
privileges of the inhabitants of the city of Rome.

   2. The sixteenth chapter of Acts gives in a graphic
manner the history of the founding of the Philippian
church. Lydia, evidently a woman of some wealth,
readily embraced the gospel, and provided in her
house a home for the missionaries. But Satan could
not allow the work to go on unmolested, and the way
in which he sought to bring it into disrepute was by
identifying his own work with it. The damsel who
followed Paul and Silas, saying, "These men are the
servants of the most high God, which show unto us
the way of salvation" (Acts 16: 16, 17), is said to
have been possessed with a "spirit of divination,"
margin, " python." This means that she was a
 priestess of the Pythian Apollo, whose chief temple
 and oracle was at Delphi. To this celebrated oracle
 people flocked to receive .information, just as people
 nowadays go to consult famous Spiritualist mediums.
6           EPISTLE TO THE PHILIPPIANS.


The damsel was really a Spiritualist medium, whom.
Satan controlled, and through whom he worked.
The effect of her testimony concerning Paul and
Silas, which was the exact truth, would be to cause
people who were favorably impressed with their
preaching to think that they were in harmony with
her. Paul's course with her was in harmony with
his injunction, "Have - no fellowship with the unfruit-
ful works of darkness, but rather reprove them."
Eph. 5:11.

   3. The miracle which Paul wrought deprived the
men of the gain which came to them through the
girl's soothsaying. This enraged them against Paul
and Silas. The student will recall that on a later
occasion, at Ephesus, a great uproar was made against
Paul and his fellow-laborers, by men who thought
that their unlawful gains were endangered. Men
who have no religion at all will often become appar-
ently very pious when they are made to think that
the preaching of the truth will interfere with their
business. Observers of the signs of the times cannot
fail to sen_that this spirit still is working. Paul and
Silas had not troubled the city. They had gone
quietly about their own work, and all the trouble
had been caused by the men who had brought the
accusation. Satan's work is always to charge upon
the servants of Christ the trouble which he himself
originates.

X           EPISTLE TO THE PHILIPPIANS.


                        NOTES.

       "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou
 shalt be saved." This is the language of inspiration,
 and must be accepted as a perfect answer to the jail-
 er's appeal for knowledge. We must accept perfect
 belief on the Lord Jesus Christ as the alt-sufficient
 means of salvation. The reason why so many speak
disparagingly of simple belief, saying, "It is all right
to believe, but we must do something, as well," is
because they fail to realize the wonderful compre-
hensiveness of Bible belief. Believing, in the Bible
sense, is doing. When Christ was asked by the Jews
what they should do in order to work the works of
God, he replied, "This is the work of God, that ye
believe on Him whom he bath sent." John 6 : 29.
This shows that there is no dajiger of antinomianism
in real faith. Paul says . that faith establishes the
law. Roni. 3: 31. That means that it is faith that
does the law, and that the law is " made void," that
is, broken, only by those who do not have faith.-
Faith is the substance of things hoped for. That is,
everything good that we long for, we get in faith. It
is that which brings strength out of weakness, and
light out of darkness, and works of righteousness in
the place of disobedience. Let no one decry faith in
Christ, but let all seek, to know what it is in truth.


   2. Paul and Silas had been set upon by a mob,
and the magistrates, in obedience to the dictates of
the mob, had beaten them, without trial, and had
thrust them into prison. Roman justice never al-
lowed a man to be punished without trial and con-
demnation, and it would have been an unlawful
thing to scourge Paul and Silas, who were Roman
citizens (Acts 16- : 37), even if they had been justly
condemned. So when the magistrates, having come
    •
            EPISTLE TO THE PHILIPPIANS.              9


to their senses, and knowing that the prisoners had
done nothing worthy of punishment, indifferently
sent messengers telling the jailer to set them at
liberty, Paul stood upon his rights as a Roman citi-
zen, and let the magistrates feel in what a compro-
mising situation they had placed themselves. He
could not have pleaded his Roman citizenship the
night before, and thus avoided the indignity, because
a mob is deaf. But now he couki make the magis-
trates sensible that they were within his power. He
had no idea of using his power to report them to Rome
and have them deposed, and perhaps beheaded; but
there can be no doubt that he designed to take
advantage of the situation, to teach the magisUate a
lesson, and perhaps to secure immunity to some ex-
tent to the disciples. From this we may learn that
it is lawful-at all times to avail ourselves as far as
possible of any natural or civil right that we may
possess, in order to check the violence of persecution.

   3. "And when they had seen the brethren, they
comforted them, awl departed." What a wonderful
lesson is in this statement! One would naturally
think that Paul and Silas, after the shameful and
cruel treatment that they had received, were the ones
to be comforted. But im; they had received their
comfort already. They had been sharers in the suf-
ferings of Christ, and he had borne their sorrow for
them.- The happiest men in Macedonia that night
were Paul and Silas. And as God had given them
comfort, they, as good stewards of the manifold grace
of God (1 Peter 4:10), ministered the same comfort
to others. From this we may learn that the proper
way to use trials is not to mourn over them, burden-
ing others in our efforts to obtain sympathy, but to '
take the increase of grace which God always gives in
tribulation, to those who will receive it, and thereby
be able to testify to others with greater confidence, of
 the goodness of God.

                        NOTES.

  •1. From the preceding lessons we have learned of
the establishment of the church at Philippi. - The
epistle written to them makes known to us when and
why it was written. It was when Paul was a prisoner
at Rome. A peculian bond of sympathy existed be-
tween Paul and the Philippian brethren, because
they had been partakers in the sonic afflictions Which
Paul suffered in bringing the gospel to them (Phil.
1:28-30), and . because they alone had attended to
his physical necessities (Phil. 4115). So when they
heard that Paul was in prison in Rome, they sent
Epaphroditus, a prominent member of the church,
with things necessary to Paul's comfort. While in
Rome, Epaphroditoshad labored beyond his strength
in assisting and caring for Paul, and had been sick,
so that he was near to death. See Phil. 4:18; 2:
25, 26. It was by him, after his recovery, that Paul
sent his letter to the Philippians, which is remarkable
for the spirit of love and tenderness that breathes
through it.

  2. In this epistle Paul associates Timothy. with
himself. It will be noticed that in the salutation of
nearly all of Paul's epistles, someone is associated
with him. Butit is only in the salutation. It does
not indicate that those mentioned had any. share in
writing the epistle, but simply that theyjoined in the
greeting to the brethren. The body of the epistle is
Paul's alone.

  3. In the Bible, the words " bishop" and "elder "
           EPISTLE TO THE PHILIPPIANS.              13


are synonymous. See Titus 1 : 5-7, where both words
are used. The word " bishop " is from a Greek word
signifying to look over, to stand guard as a senti-
nel. It is in the sense that the word "overseers" is
used in Acts 20: 28, where we read that Paul told the
elders of Ephesus to take heed to the flock over
which the Holy Spirit had made them overseers.
The idea of being overseers of the flock suggests
shepherds; and in 1 Peter 5 :1-4 we find that the
elders are called under-shepherds, Christ being the
Chief Shepherd. An elder who realizes that his
duties are those of a shepherd will know that harsh-
ness and severity are not to be among his character-
istics.

   4. " Being confident of this very thing, that he
which bath begun a good work in you will perform
it until the day of Jesus Christ." What was the
ground of Paul's confidence in this matter? The
fact that the good work had been begun by the
Lord. " Faithful is He that calleth you, who also
will do it." See 1 Thess. 5: 23,24. A work that
is begun by man, that rests upon human power, will
surely come to ,naught, no matter how good an ap-
pearance it presents for a season. Christ is the only
sure foundation. He is able to complete everything
that he begins; and this thought, coupled. with the
filet of his willingness, as shown in his beginning the
work, should beget the same confidence in all who
have given themselves to him.

  5. The word " sincere " means pure, clear, un-
mixed. The Greek word from which it is translated
has the signification of tested by the' sun, as the sun
shining through a substance is the test of whether or
not it is pure, or has an admixture of some foreign
substance. A Christian who is sincere, is tinalloyed.

He has not two purposes, but is of a single mind, and

   16. For whose sake was he ready to die?-1b.;

   17. Then whose gain did he have in mind when
he said " to die is gain "? See note 3.
   18. What shows that he had no selfish thought?
Gal. 2 : 20. •
                        NOTES.

   1. "And we know that all things work together
for good to them that love God." The superficial
observer might fail to see the fulfillment of this in
the case of Paul. The trouble is that too many in
reading the text think only of selfish good. They
do not realize that everything is good which tends to
the advancement of the cause of Christ. And when
one has accepted God's will as his will, and realizes
that God is ordering all his ways, he knows and feels
that nothing but good can come to him. This is the
only sure preventive of complaining at one's lot,
and worrying over the future. Paul's cruel treat-
ment at Philippi would have been called by some the
 worst thing that could, happen to him; nevertheless,
if it had not been for that, it is most likely that the
jailer and his family would not have heard the gos-
 pel. It worked to the good of the jailer, and then to
 the honor of Christ, and this was good to the apostle,
 who had no ambition but to honor his Master, That
 16          EPISTLE TO THE PHILIPPIANS.


 he felt that it was good is shown by the fact that he
 sang over it. Happy the soul who can say :—
             " Let good or ill befall,
                 It must be good for me,
               Secure of having Thee in all,
                 Of having all in Thee."

    2. There were two classes of people who preached
 the gospel in Rome, as a consequence of Paul's im-
 prisonment there. One class was moved by a sincere
 love of the truth, the other by envy. The latter
 class was no doubt composed of people whom Paul
 would never have thought of commissioning to preach
 the gospel, but he did not waste time in mourning,
 and thinking that the work was all going to pieces
 because he could not direct it. He knew that he
 himself was Only a servant, and that the Master was
 competent to care for his own work. He knew that
 the truth would triumph, even if he should die.
 Although there ist no evidence that these men were
 preaching false doctrine, since they preached .the
 word, and Paul rejoiced at it, we may learn a lesson'
 that may be applicable in cases where Men oppose
 the truth; for certainly the truth is more in danger
 from indiscreet advocates than from avowed opposers.
 The lesson is that the truth cannot suffer in the long
 run, because it has a power in itself. "Is not my
 word like as a fire? saith the Lord; and like a ham-
 mer that breaketh the rock in pieces?" Jer. 23:29.

    3. "For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain."
 Those who understand this verse as though it read,
." For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain to
 me," can have but a very imperfect conception of the
 spirit of the great apostle to the Gentiles. To read
 such an idea into the verse-is to do violence to the
 whole passage. Even if we know nothing of Paul's
 character but what we find here, we might learn that
           EPISTLE TO THE PHILIPPIANS.             /7


Paul has no thought of personal gain (even if that
could be secured by . death), but only of gain to
Christ. The whole passage is full of expressions of
desire for the advancement of the cause of Christ.
Paul's imprisonment has resulted in the furtherance
of the gospel, and he rejoices, knowing that he is set
for the defense, not of himself, but of the gospel: In
verse 20 lie says that his earnest expectation and
hope is that Christ should be magnified in his body,
whether by life or by death. How forced and tin=
natural, then, the supposition that in the very next
sentence he should break the continuity of his
thought, and speak about his death being a gain to
himself! No; Paul was ready to die "for the name
of the Lord Jesus" (Acts 21: 13), and as his whole
life was given to Christ, his only thought of death
Was that it might also tend to advance the cause.

persecuted? Acts 5:41.
                        NOTES.
    1. The passage in Phil. 1:22, 23 is parallel to
2 Cor. 5:1-4, in which three different conditions are
  brought to view, by the expressions, "this tabernacle,"
  or "this, "unclothed," and "clothed upon," or "be-
  ing clothed." There_ can be no question but that
  being in "this tabernacle" signifies our present life,
  when we, as Paul says in Phil. 1:24, "abide in the
  flesh." Compare 2 Peter 1:13, 14. The condition
  of being "clothed upon" is the state wherein mortal-
  ity is "swallowed up of life;" and that is at the
  coming of the Lord and the resurrection, when this
   mortal puts on immortality, and death is swallowed,
  up in victory. 1 Cor. 15:51-54. When we put on
  immortality, we are "clothed upon with our house
   which is from heaven," which is eternal. Conse-
   quently, the "unclothed" state must be the time be-
, tween the putting off of "this tabernacle" (compare
   2.Peter 1:14) and the putting on of the house from
 20         EPISTLE TO THE PHILIPPIANS".


heaven. In other words, it is the state of death.
But the apostle says that while we groan to be re-
leased from the burden of "this tabernacle,"—this
infirm flesh,—we do not groan to be unclothed, but
rather to be clothed upon. That is, the object of the
Christian's longing is not death, but the coming of
Christ. And since, also, none can be with Christ
except at his coming, it is evident that when Paul
said . that he had a desire to• 'depart and be with
Christ, he did not long for death, but for the time of
the resurrection of the dead and the translation of
the living.

   - 2. The word "conversation," in every place where
 it occurs in the Bible, bas either an entirely different
 or else a far wider signification than the one now
 commonly given to it. In Ps. 37: 14; 50 : 23 it
 means " way," as the margin indicates, mid as the
 Revised Version has it. In Gal. 1:13 it is evident
 that the word means Paul's whole course of life as a
 Jew. In Eph. 2 : 3; 4: 22 it also means "manner of
 life." This is the Most common meaning of the word.
 The Greek word from which it is translated is the
 same that is rendered "behave" in 1 Tim. 3 :15. In
 Phil. 3:20 the word "conversation" means "citizen-
 ship." We are to be strangers and pilgrims on this
 earth, having our citizenship in heaven, whence we
 look for the Lord Jesus, who has gone there to
 prepare a place for us. In Phil. 1:27 the Revised
 Version has "manner of life," and the margin gives
 the reading, "live as citizens, worthily." The idea is
•the same, and is in harmony with the statement in
 Phil. 3:20. Our citizenship is in heaven. There is
 our continuing city, and there our names are entered
 on the great register. Therefore we are to have
 our manner of life such as becomes those who say
 that they seek such a country. In other words, we
 should live as citizens of heaven. This present world
 is not the Christian's country. Heb. 13:1.4.

   Let the school sing "Coronation."
                        NOTES.
  1. " If there be therefore any consolation in Christ."
The exhortation which these words introduce is evi-
dently a conclusion from what has gone before. The
idea is that through persecution the Philippians have
been brought to understand the consolation there is
           EPISTLE TO THE.PHILIPPIANS.              23


in Christ, and the fellowship of the Spirit. And
now, by the strength of that consolation and fellow-
ship, they are exhorted to be of the same mind.
Compare chapter 1 : 27. The word "if" does not
imply any doubt about there being consolation in
Christ,,or fellowship of the Spirit (see 2 Cor. 1:3-5);
hut the apostle would make the well-known fact a
strong incentive to unity. Since they all receive con-
solation from Christ, whose sufferings they share, and
have the fellowship of the same Spirit, they must
be of the same mind.

   2. "Look not every man on his own things, but
every man also on the things of others." Phil. 2:4.
The sense of the verse is very forcibly expressed in
the Syriac Version, thus: "And lei not each be so-
licitous [only] for himself, but everyone also for his
neighbor." Compare 1 Cor. 11:25.

    3. "Who, being in the form of God, thought it not
 robbery to be equal with God." Allowing this to be
 the exact rendering of the passage, it shows the
,equality of the Father and the Son. For if Christ
 did not think it robbery to be equal with God, then
 it certainly, was not robbery to be equal with God;
 and if it was not robbery for Christ to be equal with
 God, then equality with God was his by right; to be
 equal with God he did not have to take that which
 did not belong to him. This idea is more clearly set
 forth in the Revised Version, together with the
 marginal reading. Thus: "Have this mind in you,
 which was also in Christ Jesus; who being in the
 form of God, counted it not a prize ["a thing to be
 grasped," margin] to be on an equality with god,
 but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant."
 The idea is that while Jesus, having the form of
 God, had also equality with God, he did not count
 that position a thing to be grasped or held to, while
24         EPISTLE TO THE PHILIPPIAX.'.


he saw. men going to perdition without hope. He
could not enjoy the glory of heaven without trying to
save fallen man. This is the perfect pattern of un-
selfishness. He desired not simply his own welfare,
but that of others ; he found his highest joy in con-
tributing. to the joy of others. This•enables us to
understand what Christ means when he says, "Enter
thou into the joy of thy Lord." It means that the
faithful servant will have the joy that Christ has,
namely, of seeing the happiness of souls who have
been brought to that happiness by means of his self-
denial. The thought conveyed in Phil. 2:5-7 is one
of the grandest of the Bible. A contemplation of it
cannot fail to beget love for Christ, which will mani-
fest itself in tender love for those for whom he died.

                         NOTE.
   1. The last part of chapter 2 throws a great deal
of light upon Paul's situation when he wrote the
epistle'to the Philippians. He was in prison, await-
ing his trial. Epaphroditus had come from Philippi
with assistance for him, and while waiting on him
was taken sick, doubtless with one of the fevers for
which Rome is noted. Paul's anxiety was not for
himself, but for the brethren in Philippi, not only for.
their spiritual welfare, but because they worried about
Epaphroditus. So he sent him back, although he
really needed his help, and designed, moreover, to
send Timothy. But he did not yet know how it
would go with him at his trial. He might be put to
death, he might have a little respite, or he might be
set at liberty. As soon as he should find out how
 his case would turn, he would send Timothy, thus

parting from his dearest and truest friend and helper.
The unselfishness of Paul's character, and his dis-
regard of personal trouble, and his uniform cheerful-
ness, are nowhere else so clearly exhibited as in the
epistle to the Philippians.

  1. "Beware of dogs." The word" dog" is used in
the Bible as a term of reproach. See 1 Sam. 17 :43 ;
2 Sam. 3 : 8 ; 9 : 8 ; 16 : 9. Front the connection of
2 Sam. 3 : 8 and Deut. 23: 18 we gather that it is
used to signify a shameless, corrupt person. See also"
Rev. 22:15. Men -who were guilty of nameless
crimes against nature were very common among the
heathen (Rom. 1:27), so much so that many of their •
wisest philosophers, as Socrates, made no secret of
these crimes, and commended them. There was,
therefore, great need of such warning.
 30          EPISTLE TO THE PHILIPPIANS.


    2. "Beware of the concision." From the matter-
 of-course way in which the apostle goes on to explain
 what the concision is, as contrasted with that which
 is only outward, we conclude that by the word "con-
 cision" he means "circumcision." This was a term
 used synonymously with Jews, but is here used with
 special reference to those Jews who trusted in cir-
 cumcision as the means of justification. These were
 classed with dogs and evil workers, as 'equally dan-
 gerous, for they would turn all who listened to them
 away from the simplicity of the gospel, a proceeding
 classed with the beguiling of Eve by the serpent.
2 Con 11 : 3, /1.

     3. " Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touch-
  ing the righteousness which is in the law, blameless."
  Besides his birth and his orthodox training, the two
  points above mentioned were perhaps the things on
  which Saul, the Pharisee, depended most fbr salvation.
  Believing that the traditions of the fathers were the
  commands of God (see Mark 7: 7, 8), he was " more
  exceedingly zealous" for them than any other man
  in the nation. Therefore the more he persecuted
  those who opposed traditions, the more favor he
  thought he was finding with God. Then, too, he was
  a Pharisee of the strictest sect. .,That is, he was more
  punctilious in the outward observance of the law
  than were most even of the Pharisees. So fearful
  were the Pharisees of violating some of the command-
  ments that they added many things not required by
' the law. Many of the Pharisees were hypocrites,
  but• Paul was not. If we may take the, seventh
  chapter of Romans as portraying some portion of his
  own experience before his conversion, we shall con-
  clude that his religious life was something like that
  of Luther in the monastery of Erfurt. Extreniely
  conscientious, he never knowingly did a wrong act,
  and never did anything in which another could de-
            EPISTLE TO THE PHILIPPIANS.              31


tect any wrong. He had all the righteousness that
a man can possibly get out of the law. But when
he saw the righteousness of the law as it is in Christ,
he acknowledged that all the self-righteousness upon
which he had been building his hopes of salvation,
Was so far short of perfection that it was sufficient to
condemn him;. and he gladly counted it worse than
useless, that he might receive the free gift of Christ's
perfect righteousness.

  23. Where must we look in order to attain this
growth? Heb. 12:1, 2.
                        NOTES.
  1. The fact that Paul counted all his own right-
eousness as dung that he might win Christ, is evi-
dence that there was nothing in it that would in the
least help him in the way of salvation. As he wrote
to the Romans, there is no difference between Jew
and Gentile; no one has anything that will commend
            l'PISTLE TO THE PHIL IPPIAN.t.


him to the favor of God. And if he had to count
all his natural advantages as nothing in order to win
Christ, then those advantages could be of no help to
him after gaining Christ.

   2. The righteousness which is by faith of Jesus
Christ is that perfect righteousness which_ the law
requires, but which it cannot give to any man. This
righteousness God gives freely to those who have
true faith in the blood of Christ. See Rum. 3:21-25.
When it is imputed, it not only cancels the sins of
the past, so that they are no longer counted against
the sinner, but it changes the man, making him right-
eous, so that, out of the good treasure of his heart, he
may bring forth that which is good,

    3. There is nothing that so much exalts the law of
 God as the plan of salvation through faith in Christ.
 The fact that righteousness must be received as the
 free gift of God, shows that the righteousness of the
 law is perfect; that it is far above human grasp.
 There can be no true morality without faith in Christ.
 Any scheme of religion which proposes to gain right-
 eousness by men's own works, without faith in Christ,
 must necessarily tend to immorality, by setting up a
 low standard. Thus: The man who says that he
 can work out his own righteousness, thereby pro-
 claims that his standard of morality is no • higher
 than his own acts. But this is not all. There is no
 one who will not acknowledge to having sinned.
 Now, in order that a perfect moral character be pre-
 sented, it is necessary that the man make up the
 deficiencies of the pa4. He must now do more than
 lie is required to do, in order to make up for past
 failures. Thus he advertises that his conception of
 morality is so low that his acts surpass it. So no
 matter how loudly he may talk about morality and
•progress, he is all the time unconsciously getting
 lower and lower.
34          EPISTLE TO THE PHILIPPIANS.


   4. Only those know Christ who believe and obey
him. Knowledge of God is in the Bible made
synonymous with obedience to him. It-is said of the
sons of Eli that they "were sons of Belial; they
knew not the Lord." 1 Sam. 2 :12. They knew of
the Lord; they were priests, from whom the people
were to receive knowledge of God; yet their wicked
deeds showed that they did not know God. But
Abraham, who had perfect faith in God, is called the •
friend of God.

   5. " Not as though I had already attained, either
were already perfect." The thing to be attained is
in the preceding verse said to be the resurrection of
the dead. The idea that seems to be conveyed is
that as probation ceases only at the coining of Christ
and the resurrection, unless iu the case of a person
who dies before that time, no living person can count
himself safe. The Christian life is a continual strug-
gle that will end only with life in this world. No
matter how exalted a man's position nor how great
his attainments in holiness, he is never in this life be-
yond the necessity of patient continuance in well-
doing. There is always before him the possibility of
still higher attainments..

      " For our citizenship is in heaven." This is the
proper reading of the first part of Phil. 3:20. The
word "citizenship" expresses the exact meaning of
the Greek word. The idea is that this present world
is not our home. Our citizenship is in heaven, where
is our King; there is the city which contains our
permanent residence; and we look for our Saviour to
take ns there according to his promise. Therefore;
as stated in Phil. 2:27, "we should live as citizens
worthily."

to be employed in carrying it on.
   TALKS WITH CORRESPONDENTS.—Under this heading will appear
extracts from letters of general interest, answers to questions, and sug-
gestions in regard to the manner of organizing and conducting a Sabbath-
school, etc. It is hoped that those in perplexity in regard to any branch
of the work will communicate with the editors of the WORKER. All
such letters will be answered in this department of the WORKER, or pri-
vately, as may be thought best.
   HINTS TO PRIMARY TEACHERS.—As the heading would indicate,
this department will be devoted especially to the interests of those work-
ing with the children, but teachers in every grade will find valuable sug-
gestions which, if put into practice, will be a great help to them in their
 work. This department is in charge of one who has had long experience
in the work, and therefore the suggestions offered will be of a practical
 nature.      •
   OUR MISSION FIELD.—This department will be one of special inter-
 est to all. It will contain articles on different missions and missionary
 enterprises, giving special attention to those to which our Sabbath-school
 contributions have been or are soon to be devoted. Some of the articles
 Will be followed by questions for the benefit of those who wish to snake
 use of them in Sabbath-school work.
    In addition to the above the tabulated quarterly reports from all our
 Sabbath-schools will appear each quarter.
