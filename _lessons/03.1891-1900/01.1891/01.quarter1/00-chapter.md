                     JANUARY   3, 1891.

                   JAMES

    NOTE.—There are several persons brought to
view in the New Testament who bear the name of
James, as, " James the son of Zebedee" (Mark 1: 19),
"James the son of Alphteus " (Mark 3 : 18), and
"James the brother of the Lord" (Matt. 13: 55).
Which one of these wrote the book called the epis-
tle of James, is a question on which there is great
diversity of opinion; but it is the general view (see
Smith's Bible 'Dictionary, art. "James, Epistle of")
that the writer of this book was not the apostle James,
the son of Zebedee. but James the Lord's brother,
who, though not one of the twelve, was an elder of
the church at Jerusalem, and one of the "pillars"
(Gal. 2: 9) of the new Christian faith. Acts 12 : 17;
15 :13 ; 21 :18; 1• Cor. 15 : 7 ; Gal. 1:19 (from
which we may infer that he was also an apostle); Gal. 2 :
9, 12. It was written from Jerusalem, where James
seems always to have resided, and sometime after the
apostolic council at Jerusalem, A. D. 51 (Acts 15 : 6),
the latest date assigned it being A. D. 62, the epistle.
itself (according to marginal note inserted by trans-
lators) bearing date "Arno Domini cir [about] 60."

tians? Note 2.
    6. What experiences are we to welcome, or COMA.

   15. To what is a wavering man compared? Ans.
     But let him ask in faith, nothing doubting; for
he that doubteth is like the surge of the sea driven by
the wind and tossed." Verse 6, Revised Version.
   16. What is the most striking symbol of instabil-
ity? Ans.7---A restless, ever-changing and shifting
wave of the sea.
   17. What causes a man to be like a wave of the
sea, or unstable?
   18. What illustration have we of double-minded-
ness? and how does it affect characteii,? Gen. 49 : 44;

ceive in answer to his prayers?

                        NOTES.
   1. Th.e epistle of James is addressed to Christians,
and while its lessons of patience, obedience, stability,
faith, and devotion to the cause of God, are applicable
to members of the Christian church in every age,
there are some expressions which show that it was de-
signed to be particularly applicable to the church in.
the last days, and hence may be taken to apply spe-
cifically at that time.

   2. If the epistle has a particular application to the
last days, and Christians here addressed are desig-
nated as " the twelve tribes scattered abroad," it shows
that no Israel is now recognized but Christian or
spiritual Israel, all tribal distinctions between the
natural descendants of Abraham having been lost.
It would be necessary for this distinction to be pre
served, if the natural seed is still to be regarded as
Israel; but it is evident that no such distinction with
reference to the spiritual. seed is possible among men,
                 THE BOOK OF JAMES.

though it may be preserved in those books above in
lirhich are enrolled the names of the members of the
church of the First-born. See Heb. 12: 23. This
fact with reference to the Bible view of Israel, so
plainly brought out in James, explains hoW the work
of Rev. 7 :1-8, gathering out twelve thousand from
each tribe of the children of Israel, can be fulfilled in
the last generation that lives before the second coin-
ing of Christ.

   3. The word "patience" here has the significance of
endurance, or the quality of not being moved or over-
thrown on account of the burdens, difficulties, or af-
flictions attending the profession of a Christian. The
verb' from which this noun is derived, signifies,
" to remain or stay behind when others have de-
parted; to bear up under, endure, suffer patiently;
to continue firm, hold out, remain constant, persevere."
In the expression, " Let patience have her perfect
work," the word " perfect " means "brought to com-
pletion; fully accomplished; fully developed;" but
endurance cannot be "brought to completion" until.
the period of our trial and conflict is over. The pas-
sage is therefore equivalent to the exhortation to "en-
dure unto the end" (Matt. 24:13), or to "be patient
[endure] unto the coming of the Lord" Jas. 5 : 7.

                   JAMES 1:9-x8.

  WITH James 1 : 9 a new line of thought is intro-
duced.
   1. What condition in life is referred to in the ex-
pression, "the brother of low degree "? See note 1.
   2. What is the privilege of such an one in the
gospel?

    3. In what respect is he exalted?
    4. On the plan/of Christianity, what are the rich
to do? Verse 10.

                        NOTES.

    I. Distinctions are built up among men, based upon
differences of circumstances or condition in life. But
 in the light of Christianity all such distinctions are
shown to he fictitious. The true value of a man is
shown to consist in his moral worth, and the possi-
bilities of eternal life which are set before him. It is
 for what man may become in these respects that Christ
died for him. But these advantages are open to the
low as well as the high, to the poor as well as the
rich. Christ did not die simply for the great, the
talented, the wealthy of this world; but he died
equally for those who are in the humblest and . most
destitute circumstances. Thus the "brother- of low
degree" need not sink down, crushed in spirit, under
his circumstances, esteeming himself of no value, and
harboring no high and noble aspirations; but he may
read the great interest Heaven takes in him, in the
infinite sacrifice made by Christ in -his behalf; and
thus he is "exalted " to the true plane of life, and en-
abled to take correct views of his privileges, both for
                  THE BOOK OF JAMES.                  9


the present and for the future ; and in this he may
rejoice. The rich man may also rejoice that he is
brought to see himself and his life in the true
and no longer to pride himself on circumstances
which are of no value. Thus he is "brought low"
in being enabled to discard the false exaltation of
wealth, amid estimate human worth by the true and . B1-
hie standard. The rich is brought low only as judged
by the world's standard; but it is really an exaltation
to him to become free from the world's low and false
standard, and see himself in that light which cometh
from above. It is sometimes said that " Christianity
brings all down on the same level." This is just the
opposite of the truth; it brings all sip on the same
level.

    2. On verses 13-16 J. P. Thompson, D. D., has the
 following excellent remarks : "The philosophy of sin
 is given in verses 13-16 in terms that answer exactly
 to our own experience. God is not the author of sin.
 God does not subject us to temptation, that, through•
 sinning, we may illustrate his grace. Vials as tests
 of our choice of good or evil, of our faith in himself,
 of our love and devotion, he does appoint for our
.moral discipline and culture; but temptations that
 look toward sin, and lead to sin, are the promptings
 of our own desires when these are loosed from the
 control of reason and conscience. The sin does not
 lie in the fact of temptation, nor in the susceptibility
 to temptation ; but when we suffer our susceptitilities
 to natural good to be wrought upon to such a degree
 that they entice us to forget reason, conscience, duty
 to God, when these overstimulated desires come to a
 head in the decision of the will to gratify them—then
 do they bring forth sin. The counteractive to such
 temptation is a just conception of our highest good as
 in God, and from him; a patient, prayerful, unwav-
 ering trust in him, and the keeping his word in our
 hearts as our law and guide."

     3. In 1 Cor. 15: 20,23. Christ is declared to be the
  "first-fruits;" and he alone is the first-fruits so far as
  his being the antitype of the wave-sheaf (Lev. 23 :10,
  11) is concerned, and also as related to "them that
. sleep." But Rev. 14: 4 says that the 144,000 (of
  whom that passage speaks) are the first-fruits; and
  this at first sight appears like a contradiction. But
 mow the passage before us in James comes in to ex-
  plain, by showing that the word " first-fruits" is also
  used in another sense,—we are a kind of, or in a
  certain sense, first-fruits unto God. The 144,000 are
  those who are redeemed from among the living at
  the coming of Christ ; and if James, as we have seen,
 also speaks particularly of the last' generation, when
 the Lord is at the door, the relation between the two
  passages very strikingly appears.

   1. Looking only occasionally into the great mirroi:
of God's law, to note how our course of conduct varies
from its holy requirements, is not. enough. For, like •
the man who turns away from the mirror, and soon
loses from his mind a sense of the defects which it re-
vealed, so we, when we fail to keep the law before us,
soon lose a sense of our duty. But we should "con-
tinue therein," that is, continue looking into the per-
fect law of liberty, and then as fast as we thereby dis-
cover defects in our characters, take hold, by the grace
of Christ, to remedy them. There are many who do
not like the law, because it exposes their sins; and so
they. try to persuade themselves that it has been
abolished, as if that would remove their defects of
                 TfIE BOOK OF J A 3r ES.

character. This is as wise as it would be for a man
to dash a mirror into fragments because it revealed
defects in person or clothing, and then imagine that.
that removed the defects.

   2. "Religion" is from religare, which signifies " to
bind anew or back, to bind fast."— TVebster. It de-
notes that bond by which a man is attached to the
service of the deity he worships. Hance there may
be false religions as well as true, vile and degrading
religions as well as pure and undefiled. One may
seem to be very religious, and yet his religion be vain,
or worthless. But he who has true religion will bridle
the tongue that he speak no evil, visit the fatherless
and widows in the performance of deeds of sympathy
and charity, and keep himself free from the works of
the flesh (Gal. 5: 19-21) and tha follies of the world.

                        NC rES.
   1. In this chapter James proceeds to speak more
particularly of the false. distinctions built up among
men and by men, and the respect to different ones
wrongly manifested on account of these distinctions.
This he sets forth by an illustration, in which he takes
occasion to state more fully the grand truth that all
these barriers are swept away by the gospel, and all
men stand alike before God. And none who profess
the faith, or religion, of Jesus Christ should counte-
nance any such distinctions, nor manifest any partial-
ity to the different members of the church.

  2. The word "assembly" in verse 2 is translated
"synagogue" in the margin. In a general sense ft is
not to be confined to Jewish synagogues but would
denote any place of meeting.

   3. Verse 4 reads, "Are ye not then partial in your-
selves?" or, Do ye not make a difference among
yourselves? that is, calling one better than another
because one is rich and another is poor, whereas no
such distinction should be recognized, but every ques-
tion should be decided on its merits, and not on the
condition or circumstances of the individual. Then,
says the apostle, if you act thus. are ye not "become
judges of evil thoughts," or, in other words, judges
having evil thoughts, or judging according to an in-
correct or evil principle. This again would be wrong.

   4. The reference to the "judgment-seat," in verse 6,
would seem to strengthen the idea that James, in the
first part of this chapter, has reference to the settle-
ment of difficulties by law. The rich are the very
ones who are apt to oppress in this way those whom
they dislike on account of their religion, or for other
reasons. And they are the ones who, if unbelievers,
most generally make light of Christianity and blas-
                 THE BOOK OF JAMES.                  15

pheme the name of Christ. And even if they profess
to be believers, they might even then blaspheme his
name by going contrary to his instructions in their
treatment of the brethren. Matt: 18: 15-17. The
Christian is the last person in the world to fawn upon
a rich man on account of his riches, considering what
they are liable to lead him to do. But while there •
is no sin in riches, in themselves, if properly acquired,
and no virtue in poverty, from the same point of
view, yet the fact remains that the rich are more apt
to be worldly, and the poor in this world's goods
more ready generally to look forward to the promised
kingdom and acquire by faith an interest in the ever
lasting riches.

   22. How is this illustrated in verses 15-17?
                        NOTES.
   1. In verse 8 James calls those to whom he writes
into the presence of a higher, a supreme law, before
which all stand as equal. In its sight there are no
rich or poor, high or low. Its inquiries respect only
right and wrong, innocence and guilt. It is the
" royal " law, because it is the law of the great King.
Before this all must bow. Li accordance with this,
all petty difficulties must be settled, and our conduct
                 THE BOOK OF JAMES.

one toward another be regulated. Thus the apostle
fittingly reaches the climax of his argument,:

   2. The commandment, "Thou shalt love thy neigh-
bor as thyself," is not taken from the decalogue, but is
found iu Lev. 19 :18. Yet Christ sets this down asthe
second of the two great commandments in the law."
Matt. 22:36-40. In answer to this question by a law-
yer, " Which is the great commandment in the law?"
Jesus answered : "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all
thy mind. This is the first and great commandment.
And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy
neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments
hang all the law and the prophets." What is here
called "the first and great commandment," is likewise
not found in the decalogue, but in Deut. fi : 5. From
these facts some are disposed to argue that the ten
commandments do not occupy the supreme position of
"the law of God ; " fbr if they did, they say, the Lord
would have quoted them in answer to the lawyer's
question ; but as, instead, he quoted from the books
of Moses, therefore they claim there is no distinction
between the ten commandments and the law of Moses;
and quotations from other parts of the Mosaic code
are put before the ten commandments. But all such
false reasoning is overturned by the way in which
James here presents the subject. He says that we
are to fulfill the royal law according to the scripture,
"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." Then he
shows what he means by the " royal law " by quoting
two of the ten commandments. Thus he demonstrates
the connection between that scripture and the deca-
logue by showing that that part of the decalogue
which relates to our duties to our fellow-men, which
contains the commandments, "Thou shalt not kill,"
and, "Thou shalt not commit adultery," is summed
up in the command to love our neighbors as ourselves;
18                THE BOOK OF JAMES.

and consequently the first table of the decalogue, that
part which relates to our duty to God, is summed,
up in the command to love God with all the heart.
What Christ said, therefore, to the lawyer was equiv-
alent to quoting the whole decalogue, since he gave
an epitome of both tables.

    3. On James 2 : 10, J. P. Thompson, D. D., has the
 following pertinent note " The law of God is -,ot a
 string of precepts; it is a principle, a spirit, a unity.
 It encircles one like a ring of gold. If he steps over
 it at any point, he goes outside of it, and is a trans-
 gressor as really as though he should break it in
 pieces at every point. Indeed, one breaks this law
 by the spirit of pride, of envy, of jealousy; by any
-feeling which, if carried out into action, would do in-
jury to a neighbor. Only the spirit of love pervading
 all our conduct can preserve intact the pure and -
'holy law."—The Bible in the Home, p. 119

     4. "Mercy rejoiceth [margin, " glorieth "] against
:judgment." James 2:10. Various constructions are
 put upon this passage ; but that which seems to be the
 most obvious design of the declaration is to show how
 'exceedingly precious a quality mercy is in the sight
  of heaven. He that shows no mercy will receive
  none. He who shows mercy will receive it. Matt. 5:
  7. And mercy rejoiceth against judgment, that is, it
  is a matter of rejoicing, one in which we may glory,
  and which redounds to the glory of God, that a plan
  has been devised whereby mercy can be consistently
  extended to those who are under condemnation and
 justly exposed to judgment. No principle of God's
  government has been sacrificed, no lowering of God's
  authority has been suffered, no indignity has been
  cast upon the law; and yet the sinner can be saved.
  Thus -mercy rejoiceth against judgment.

                       NOTES.
   1. A great deal of unnecessary discussion has
taken place over the question whether or not James
contradicts Paul on the subject of justification by
faith, or faith and works. But there is no contradic-
tion between them ; they simply treat the subject.
from different standpoints. Paul presents a faith that
produces works. James presents works that are pro-
duced by faith. The following remarks by J. P.
                 THE BOOK OF JAMES.

Thompson, D. D., are 10. the point : "Faith and works
are like the two poles of the galvanic battery: they
must be brought together in order that the current of
life may flow and give out sparks of love. Either is
powerless without the other. They are the two foci
of an ellipse, in which the Christian life moves on in
its heavenly course—now nearing one, and now the
other-T-but held by both in constant equilibrium. To
remove either would be to make that life erratic, or
cause it suddenly to collapse and come to a stand.
James represents one pole, one focus ; Paul, the other.
Their teachings are not opposed, and should not be
divorced. James puts faith into concrete forms. He
holds, as strongly as does Paul, to the necessity of
faith ; everything must be sought in faith; everything
must be done in faith. But it must be a living faith
—a faith that shows its sincerity by the sacrifices of
self which it makes, by the works of love which it
performs. A merely intellectual orthodoxy may be
held by demons. A mere profession of faith may be
worth no more than the body of a man without the
breath of life. A true faith loves, works, lives. It
regulates the conscience, the speech, and the life, by
the conviction of God's constant presence; it shows
its appreciation of spiritual realities by separation
from the world ; it takes the law of God as a reality,
and, bringing its grand truths and inspiring motives
to bear directly upon the conduct of every day, works
by love."—Bible in the Home, p. 115,

   2. "It is impossible to separate works from faith,
yea, as impossible as it is. to separate burning and
shining from fire."—Luther.
   "James by no means affirms that works give life
to, produce, or create, faith ; for faith comes by the
power of the word, entering into and received by us,
and by nothing else. But faith grows complete in
works. That is the same as Paul's saying, or, rather,
                 THE BOOK OF JAMES.

the Lord's saying to Paul, that the st.ength of God
may be completed in weakness. 2 Cor. 12 : 9. The
strength of faith, indwelling from the beginning, and
already received along with the first seizing of grace,
becomes fully proved, verified, and its operation com-
pleted. Thus our calling and election are made sure
in the diligence of living and doing. 2 Peter 1 :10.
Thus Abraham's first call was made sure in his last
works, and the word concerning justification by (out
of) faith, already before accorded to him, was law-.
fully and actually confirmed as a truth."—StiO.

  21. What inconsistent, use of the tongue is further

  22. Whom does the apostle mean by " we" in this
verse? See note 5.
                       NOTES.
   1. The word rendered " master " in verse 1 is by
some here rendered "teacher "—be not many teachers
—and thought to refer to an aggressive and offensive
propagandism of religious views. One of the defini-
tions of the word, to be sure, is. "teacher;" but the
lexicons make it, in the New Testament, the equivalent
of "rabbi," so that Matt. 23 :8 would .apply to it ;
Y4                THE BOOK OF JAMES.

and if we give it the sense of "teacher," the subject and
context would oblige us to understand it as meaning
to dictate, or set up one's views as the standard,
and try to oblige everyone else to conform to them.
Such expose themselves to greater condemnation;
for all are fallible and liable to mistakes. This is
true even of prophets and apostles. See the cases
of Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jonah, Paul, Peter, "and
Barnabas. Acts 21:26-28 ; Gal. 2 :11-13. And
when one enters upon a calling for which he is not
fitted, and claims more than lie is justly entitled to, he
is the more censurable.

   2. No work is more difficult than the proper govern-
ment of the tongue. Useless, frivolous, idle, or inju-
rious conversation is the bane of many lives. The
danger of abuses of the tongue enters even into the
domain of religion ; and religious controversy is too
apt to be characterized by sharp, bitter, and conten-
tious words.

   3. How large a proportion of unhappiness in the
family, of trouble in society, and alienation and discord
in the church, comes from a wrong use of the tongue!
And how apt many are, even if they do not originate
a slanderous report, to take it up and repeat it to oth-
ers! So if we have not a slanderous tongue, we may
have an ear for scandal ; and this is a twin evil, for
without this the occupation of the tattler and busy-
body in other men's matters would soon be gone.

   4. In verses 6-8, James evidently has reference to the
unregenerate tongue ; for the grace of God can bring
it into subjection. The grace of God can purify the
heart, which is the great fountain out of which come
thoughts, that blossom into words. But when the
fountain is made right, that which comes from it will
be right. So it is said that "a goodonan out of the
                 THE BOOK OF JAMES.                  LB


good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which
is good." Luke 6 : 45. The true remedy then
against the evils which flow from the tongue is to have
the heart subdued and made right in the sight' of
God::

  5. Verse 9 would seem rather to apply to those who
have a form of godliness but deny the power thereof,
who have a form of lip service toward God, and while
professing to honor God, the Creator or Father of all,
yet denounce or curse their fellow-men, the creature,
either for their lack of religion, or because they fancy
they have the wrong religion. By the word ‘.‘ we,"
the apostle doubtless refers to a general condition
among men, not including himself personally as guilty
of the inconsistency of which he speaks. Just as it
is often said that " we " do this or that, and take this
or that course, when all that is meant is that people
generally do so.

   22. In what class will these fruits appear?—Ib.,
last clause.
   23. How does Christ speak of, this class? Matt.
5 ; 9.
                        NOTES.
   1.• James 3 :10.—" These things ought not so to be."
The force of the word translated " ought," is stronger
than is expressed by the English word. It means that
it must not be so. It is so inconsistent that it is ut-
terly intolerable; it is monstrous.

   2. Verse 11.—" Sweet water and bitter." The sweet
water corresponds to the "blessing," and the bitter
water to the "cursing". spoken of in the verse before.
And as a fountain does not send out both sweet and
bitter water from the same place at the same time, so
from the fountain of the heart should not come forth
both blessing and cursing. But, as in a fountain,
if bitter water should perchance be mingled with the
sweet, the whole would be spoiled, so all the blessings
which the heart utters toward God are utterly vitiated
and spoiled by the cursings which the same heart
utters toward men. Hence it brings forth no good
fruit at all.

    3. Verse 12.—James' statement concerning the fig-
tree and the vine is much stronger than that in refer-
ence to the fountain, for two veins of water, a good
and a poor, might possibly meet and pour forth their
mingled streams from the same orifice; but in nature
it is impossible for the fig-tree to bear olives; or a vine,
figs. Such a monstrosity in nature is unknown. It.
remains for human nature alone to make so depraved
an exhibition. But the fruit determines the nature of
the tree. If olive berries are produced, however
23                THE BOOK or JAMES.

much the tree may bear an outward semblance to the
fig, it is not a fig-tree, but an olive-tree. So if the,
traits of a man's character are evil, if that is the fruit
he bears, however much he may profess to be a Chris-
tian, he is not such, but a sinner. A soul that is de-
praved must act within the bounds of that depravity.
Hypocrisy, the counterfeit, can be manifested only
on the side of the good. A soul really good cannot
manifest sham traits of evil, for it would thereby be-
come evil; but a soul really evil can manifest sham
traits of goodness, and not thereby become good.

   4. Verse 13.—Heavenly wisdom has an inseparable
attendant, which is love; and love produces fruits by
which its presence is ever manifested, and by which
a person's condition can be tested. If anyone claims
to be endowed with true wisdom, let us note what ef-
feet it has on his temper and conduct. Is his whole
course of conduct characterized by meekness? Does
he seek to avoid sin, and follow the things which
make for peace? Is he in behavior modest and mod-
erate, patient and harmless? Is he ready to yield to
claims which are just and proper? Is he kind and
compassionate, and ready to forgive Is he careful and
diligent in the performance of his duties toward God
and toward men? Is he sincere and upright in all
his decisions? Such traits are characteristic of true
wisdom, that which is from apove, as specified in verse
17.

   5. Verse 18.—Righteousness as manifested in the
manner set forth in the verses embraced in this lesson,
is sure to produce its good results, as seed that is sown
is to produce a harvest. It is men of peace who
sow the seeds of truth. Men of turmoil and strife can-
not recommend any course, nor properly advocate any
truth. But the peace-makers are continually recom-
mending the wisdom by which they are governed, to
                 THE BOOK OF JAMES.                  29

others; and their course of conduct is represented as
the sowing of heavenly seed, which is sure to bring
forth divine fruit. "To enjoy the peace of God in the
conscience, and to live to promote peace among men,
is to answer the end of our creation, and to enjoy as
much happiness ourselves as the present state of
things can afford."—Clarke.

  26. Why must a double-minded man purify his
heart? See James 1 : 6-8.
                        NOTES.
   1. James 4:1.—The apostle passes by a sharp and
painful transition from the ideal as brought to view
in the close of the preceding chapter, where he speaks
of the fruits of righteousness being sown in peace of
them that make peace, to a state of things which is
too often a reality in the church, when there is con-
tention and brawling and strife. He then points out
the source from which these things spring. They are
the opposite of that wisdom which comes from above,
of which he spoke in the preceding chapter, and come
from the motions of sin in our members. Lange says :
" Every sensual and selfish lust which is not killed in
the heart of the Christian, sooner or later must work
disastrously, to the detriment of fraternal communion.
Disappointed hopes should not fill us with bitterness
and hatred against one• another, but rather prompt us
to humility and believing, confiding prayer."

   2. Verse 2.—" Ye kill, and desire to have." This
is to be taken, according to the context, not in a lit-
eral but spiritual sense, as in verse 4. It refers to a
condition of the mind. In the former dispensation,
in the cases of David and Ahab, the envy and desire
to obtain, led to actual murder. The same feelings
are the springs of the same crimes now. John says,
" Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer." The
marginal reading, therefore, though not in this case a
literal translation of the word used, doubtless conveys
the true idea by referring to that condition of mind
which, if suffered to develop to its full extent, would
 lead to murder.

  3. "Ye ask not." The fact that people will at-
tempt to bring before God in prayer the unhallowed
and worldly ends which they seek, is a sad coalmen-
 32                THE BOOK OF JAMES.

 tary on the condition of self-deception into which one
 may fall. To ask for improper things in an improper
 spirit, is, in one sense, not to ask at all; for Heaven
 does not regard such prayers. From another point
 of view, it is called asking "amiss." Verse 3. Prayer
 offered for the right objects, and put up in the right
 spirit, will alone secure the blessing.

    4. Verse 5.—There is no passage to be found in the
 Scriptures which contains the precise language here
 given. It is not a direct . quotation: This leads to
 the necessary conclusion that what the Scriptures
 teach in various passages, and by various forms of
 phraseology, is spoken of as what the Scriptures say.

   5. Verse 8.—The washing or cleansing of the hands
 was a token of innocence and purity. As sinners we
 must cleanse our hands from wicked works ; and as
 double-minded, we must put away that fickleness and
 indecision of mind which counteracts all our efforts
 for good, and have " faith, nothing wavering." For
 only those who are clean of hands and sincere and
 pure of heart can effectually draw near to God.

  2.5. If he does not do this, what is it to him? See
note 4.
                        NOTES.
   1. James 4: 9.—The hilarity of the world, the vain
and frivolous mirth of sin, is always to be avoided;
and those who have always been in it; or who have
been seduced into it by backsliding from a Christian
life, should turn at once to God with deep contrition
of heart. God's mercy cannot be expected without
true and genuine repentance. But this condition of
sorrow for sin will lead to the peace and joy of believ-
ing. • Jesus says, " Blessed are they that mourn ; for
they shall be comforted." Matt. 5: 4. The Chris-
tian has the truest joy in the world. It is only the
deceitful and disappointing exhilaratious of sin that
the Bible denounces and warns us against. And es-
pecially- is such an admonition as this timely in the
last, days, the period to which, as we have seen, the
epistle of James especially applies. See Joel 2: 1,
14-17; 1 Peter 4 : 7.

  2. Verse 10.—" In the sight of the Lord." When
4 person is convicted of sin in his own heart, he can
turn no way but he sees the eyes of the Lord upon
him. So when he yields in humility to him, it is em-
phatically "in his sight." But he does not reproach
us, and hold us in the dust with his foot upon our
necks, as worldly conquerors were wont to do to their
                 THE BOOK OF JAMES.                   35


prostrate enemies ; but he reaches forth his pardon-,
ing hand and lifts us up.

   3. Verse 11.—The sin of evil speaking is set as
a violation of that great moral law by which we are
to be judged at last. James 2: 12. That law in
one of its great precepts says, " Thou shalt love
thy neighbor as thyself. This precept we vio-
late when we speak evil of a brOther, and judge his
motives. We thereby speak evil of the law, which
fOrbids such a course of action, and judge the law by
virtually condemning such a requirement on its part.
Thus we set ourselves above the position of one whose
sole duty it is to be a doer of the law, by setting our-
selves up to judge whether its requirements are right
or not, and then to follow our own judgments instead
of what- it demands.

   4. Verse 17.—Here James virtually says that after
the-instruction he had set before them, no one could
plead ignorance of his duty ; and then if, knowing it,
he would not do it, he would of course have the
greater condemnation. " He that knew not," says
Christ, "and did commit things worthy of stripes,
shall be beaten with few stripes;" but he "which
knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither
did according to his will, shall be beaten with many
stripes." Luke 12 : 47, 48.

   9 : 25, 26 ; Prov. 18 : 23 ; Micah 6 :12; Matt. 13 :
22; 19:23, 24 ; 1 Tim. 6 : 10.
    18. What is meant by " a day of slaughter " in
,,Tames 5 : 5, last clause? A72S.-A day when animals
 are slain and provided for a time of feasting; and it
 indicates that they give themselves up to indulge in
 every kind of riot and excess.
    19. How do they at the same' time treat the just?
 Verse G.
     20. What attitude do the latter class assume?—/b.
     21. In what way only coulcr " the just" properly
 seek redress from oppression? Ans.—Not by vio-
  lence, but by legal means.
     22. What is the primary signification of the word
  here rendered "resist "? Ans.—It means "to set
  one's self in formal array against." It would, there-
  fore, very properly apply to the attempt to maintain
  a cause against an antagonist in a court of justice.
• But in the present day a man who has nothing but
  justice on his side, does not stand much of a chance,
  when a large amount of capital is arrayed against
  him. They are wise, therefore, who do not attempt
  to " resist " even in this manner.
                         NOTES.

   1. Verse I.None are more ready to take rose- •
 colored views of the future than the rich. None are
 more pleased with the "peace and safety" cry of the
 last days. 1 Thess. 5 : 3. But " sudden destruction"
38               THE BOOK OF JAMES.

is then impending. So while they are anticipating
good days to come, and are saying in their hearts,
" To-morrow shall be as this day, and much more
abundant," this prophecy calls upon them to weep
even unto howling for the calamities, judgments, and
miseries of the great day of the Lord which are hang-
ing over them, and from which their riches, in which
they have so blindly trusted, will not deliver them. It
is instructive to notice how often the rich are particu-
larly mentioned in descriptions of the scenes ofthe day
of the Lord.

   2. Verse 4.—The hire of the laborers crieth. The
condition of things at the present day in respect to
the increase of riches, is a strange and startling one.
There has never before been a time in the world's
history when such fortunes could be accumulated,
and in so short a time, as can be to-day. These could
not have been accumulated without the great inven-
tions of modern times; and these have appeared as
one feature of the prophecy of Daniel that in the time
of the end knowledge should be increased. Dan.12 : 4.
Thus a few persons acquiring immense fortunes can
combine their capital, and hold the mass of the peo-
ple entirely at their mercy in every commercial point
of view. Until this state of things existed, the labor
troubles which now so deeply stir society, were un- .
known. Hence it is what would be expected, that
James, in predicting the phenomenal increase of
riches, should also throw in some remarks indicating
that such a state of things would cause trouble on the
part of the laborers. It is certainly an unnatural
and unhealthy state of things when a man without
capital, but with an aptitude for what is called "busi-
ness," can start in, and by a shrewd manipulation of
circumstances, and in half a score of years, come out
with ten or twenty ..millions, as many do nowadays
while the toilers whose labor has created these mill-

ions which these men draw into their coffers, are on-
the downhill road of poverty, under more exacting
conditions; for there is too much of truth in the cur-
rent aphorism that "the rich are growing richer, and
the poor are growing poorer." There is no wonder
that.tbe situation breeds trouble, and no doubt that it
will continue to do so, till society breaks up in the
great time of trouble that ushers in the day of the-
Lord.

   1. James 5 : 7.—A very beautiful illustration in
reference to the exercise of patience is drawn from the
course and experience of the husbandman. He does
riot expect the yield of his fields, or the fruit of • the
earth, in a day. He sows and plants in faith. He
carefully tends and cultivates the growing crops,
though no fruit is apparent, and he knows that months
must elapse before it will be matured. But his pa-
tience is at length rewarded, and his bins and barns
are stored with plenty. So we are not to expect the
Lord to accomplish all his work in a moment of time.
Influences must have time to do their work and pre-
pare a harvest for the kingdom of heaven. The
promise of God being given is sufficient ground for
our faith and patience. And if we faithfully endure,
our patience will at length be rewarded by a revela-
tion of the glories of the kingdom of God.

   2. "-The early and latter rain." For six months in
the year, in the agricultural portions of Palestine, no
rain falls. During this time "the whole land," it is
said, "becomes dry, parched, and brown, the cisterns
are empty, the springs and fountains fail, and the
autumnal rains are eagerly looked for to prepare the
earth for the reception of the seed. These, the early
rains, commence about the latter end of October or
beginning of November, in Lebanon a month earlier,
not suddenly, but by degrees; the husbandman has
thus the opportunity of sowing his fields of wheat and
barley." From this time on showers fell during the
 period-of the growth and development of the crop till
 the spring, when copious showers were expected to
42               THE BOOR' OF .7.131ES.


ripen the grain for the harvest. This was termed the
latter rain. This course of nature is taken to illus-
trate the work of the Spirit in this dispensation.
When, on the day of Pentecost, the great work of the
gospel began, the Spirit was poured out marvelously.
This, with he wonderful manifestation during the
apostolic age, constituted the "early rain." The work
of the Spirit- has continued more or less from that
time to this; but as the work ofgrace shall draw to a
close, a more copious outpouring of the Spirit may be
expected to ripen the gospel harvest for the kingdom
of God. The second coming of Christ is represented
by a reaper coming with a sharp sickle to reap the
harvest of the earth. Rev. 14: 14. From this ex-
pression in James, that the husbandman waits long till
he receive the early and latter rain, and from Hosea
6 : 3, where the latter rain is mentioned first, it would
appear that the latter rain was so abundant as to be
accounted two together—the latter rain and the first
added to it. If this is so, we may look for more, than
the scenes of Pentecost to be re-enacted Among the
people of God before the end.


   3. Verse 11.—" The end of the Lord." The word
" end " here means o ject or. purpose. You " have
seen" the "object" or "purpose" of the Lord in afflict-
ing Job. In a similar sense the word is used in 1 Peter
1 :9, "Receiving the end of your faith, even the sal-
vation of your souls," that is, the object, or aim, of
your faith. These instances explain the use of the
word in Rom. 10 : 4, "For Christ is the end of the
law for righteousness to everyone that believeth ; "
that is, the " object" or "purpose " of the law; or,
to express it in other words, the purpose which the
law was designed to secure in us, if we had never
broken it, is now secured to us by Christ', if we will
believe in him.
                 THE BOOR' OF JAMES.

   4. Verse 12.—The variety of oaths mentioned in
this verse shows that it cannot be the judicial oath
which is referred to, which is simply calling upon
God to witness to the. truth of what you affirm.
Jesus himself under an oath of this kind made an-
swer to the Jewish high priest. Matt. 26 : 63. Paul
made a strong affirmation of this kind in 2 Cor. 1:
23: "Moreover I call God for a record upon my
soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Cor-
inth." Again, Phil. 1 : 8: " For Rod is my record,"
etc. Rom 9 :1: " I say the truth in Christ, I lie
not." 2 Cor. 11 : 31 : " The God and Father of our
Lord Jesus Christ . . . knoweth that I lie not."
 Gal. 1 : 20 : " Behold, before God, I lie not." 1 Tim.
2:7: "I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not."
These expressions are all of the nature of, arid equiv-
alent to, a judicial oath. James doubtless had refer-
ence to a practice which our Lord severely condemned
in Matt. 5 : 33-37, that is, a hasty and rash kind of
 promise to do something, or an affirmation of some
statement, pledging something for the accomplishment'
or the truthfulness of the thing stated. We have no
 right to do this, by heaven, nor earth, nor Jerusalem;
for these are not ours to dispose of; nor should we
swear by our head (or, according to modern phrase,
" Bet' yer life "), for our head is not at our disposal,
 and we have not power to make one hair white or
 black.

  23. If we succeed in turning him front his error,
what good work is done?
                        NOTES.
    1. Verse 14.—" The elders." The word rendered
." elders " signifies primarily "one advanced in years
 and experience," and as from this class the spiritual
 leaders of the early church were probably chosen, it
 came to signify that office. In the case before us, the
.instruction need not refer exclusively to the officers
 of the church; for the service of offering prayer for
 the sick can be properly rendered by anyone who
  has had years of experience in the exercise of faith,
 and the duties of a Christian life. That those who
 are elders in years and in Christian service are
  to be held in special honor in the church, is evident
 from such passages as 1 Tim. 5 :1.

     2. "Anointing with oil." This is done simply as
  an act by which to give expression to our faith, as
  the oil is not applied for any medicinal virtues which
  it may possess. As directed by James, the oil is ap-
  plied to a person with a view to his healing. This
' has been perverted by the Roman Catholic Church
  to applying oil to a person with a view to his death.
  They call it "extreme unction," and make it one of
  the sacraments of the church. But for such a prac-
  tice there is not the least warrant in the Scriptures.
46               THE BOOK OF J A YIES.

   3. Verse 15.—The promises in reference to the
sick are not absolute and unconditional; if they were,
 none need ever die from sickness, nor even from old
age, which is only a species of sickness. But all
are mortal and under sentence of death, and there is
a special promise for those who die in the Lord, as
Christians, in the last days. Rev. 14:13. God, who
sees as man cannot see, knows that sometimes it would
not be best that the prayers we offer in our short-
sightedness should be answered. So our prayers
should be offered at all times subject to his will.
Even the prayers of the apostles for the sick were
not always answered; for it is not a 'supposable case
that Paul and his brethren should not have prayed
for the recovery of Trophimus ; yet we are informed
that lie, at one time, left him at Miletum sick. 2
Tim. 4 : 20. Even the "signs" to follow believers
(Mark 16 : 17, 18) are subject to conditions; for they
will not be wrought to meet the challenge of skepti-
cism, nor to gratify curiosity, nor for any idle pur-
pose ; but only when the necessities of his servants
require that he interpose in their behalf, or when
it will be for his glory to do so. Why, then, pray for
the sick at all? James lays it down as a general rule
that we do so; and such a course always has its ad-
vantages. • It cultivates in us a spirit of prayer and
dependence on God. It begets the habit of turning to
him to whom we should turn, in calamities and afflic-
tion. It will often create conditions under which
God will be pleased to interpose in our behalf, as he
could not consistently do without our expressed de-
sireS and earnest petitions to this end. And. we know
not how many blessed answers may be obtained, till
the trial is made.

  4. Verse 16.—Confession of faults is directed to be
made, not all to one, as all are required to confess to
a priest in the Roinish Church, and in some half-
                 THE BOOK OF JAMES.                  47
     ,   •
reformed Episcopal Churches, but it is to be made
one to another; and this is to be done only so far as
we have injured one another by some wrong course.
Confession should be limited, as to publicity and ex-
tent, to the injury done. If an offense has been openly
committed, a scandal to the church and to the com7.
munity, it should be publicly confessed.       only. one
person is, knowing to, or affected by, a wrong com-
mitted by another, confession should be made to that
one, and the matter be made right with him; and
that is as far as the matter need go. And if the sin
is a matter between ourselves and God • only, to him
alone confession should be made. A homely illustra-
tion is often used to express the true position on this
point, and that is, " Make the plaster no larger than
the sore." The Romish Church has perverted James
5:16 to sustain auricular confession to the priest,
a custom which is one of the mightiest engines of evil
ever devised by -Satan. The priests use it for the
vilest purposes.

   5. Verse 17.—The enemy would tempt us to a lack
of faith by suggesting that Elijah was a person of au
order superior to ourselves, and we need not think
that we can prevail with God as he did; but, as if for
the special purpose of warding off that temptation, the
record states_that he "was a man subject to like pas-
sions as we are." Our temptations and sense of imper-
fections need not, therefore, disarm or discourage us.
We have no account of the particular occasion when
he prayed for rain. When first introduced into the
Scripture narrative (1 Kings 17 : 1), he meets King
Ahab, and boldly announces -to him that there should
be neither dew nor rain upon the land of Israel but
according to his word. James says that he prayed
that it might not rain, and this was in answer to his
prayer. He must have prayed and received the as-
surance from God that lie was heard, before he made
48              THE Pc 0A- OF 74.1rEs.

this announcement to Ahab. The king, not looking
beyond. Elijah, and understanding that the drought
was to be according to the word of Elijah, as he had
declared, accused him of being the one that - was
troubling Israel. 1 Kings 18 :17. But Elijah told
the king that he was the one who was troubling
Ismel, because he had forsaken the commandments
of the Lord. This shows the place prayer has in the
divine plans.

   6. Verse 20.—God alone can convert a sinner ;
yet he who co-operates with God in this work, 'is
spoken of as doing the work, and saving a soul
irom death, and hiding a multitude of sins, by
helping to the result of haying them blotted out
of the books at last.
