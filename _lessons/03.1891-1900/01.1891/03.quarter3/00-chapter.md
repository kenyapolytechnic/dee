       EOR SENIOR CLASSES.


                INTRODUCTION.
   NOTE I.—It. is impossible to include the whole book of
Mark in twenty-six lessons, or in six months' time, the
period allotted to it by the International Sabbath-school
Committee. It has been thought best, therefore, to
gather out its most striking and important lessons, in-
stead of attempting to cover the entire life and ministry
of Christ. Of the connection historically and chronolog-
ically we will say but very little, as Mark follows no
StriCtly                oi del, and to attempt to explain
the chronology of each event in the life of Christ with
Mark for a basis would invite controversy and divert
the mind of the student from the real lesson. The writer
of the book of Mark was a Hebrew, whose name was
also John, spoken of as "John, whose surname was
Mark" (Acts 12:12); he was nephew to Barnabas, and
accompanied Paul and Barnabas for a time in the work,
but for some reason, displeasing to Paul, left them (Acts
13: 5, 13; 15: 37, 38). He afterward became profitable to
the apostle, and was an instrument in the hand of God
in spreading abroad the gospel. Although the shortest
of the gospels, Mark is very full in its suggestions.
Only three years of our Lord's ministry is related by
him.

    NOTE 2.—SUGGESTIONS ON THE STUDY OF THE 'LES-
SONS.—The student will be helped very materially in the
study of these lessons if he will first read prayerfully,
carefully, thoughtfully, the Scripture covered by the les-
son, and then the parallel passages in the other gospels,
before studying by questions. Wherever the parallel pas-
sage is referred to after a question, it is because it brings
out an additional thought, or adds force to the regular
lesson scripture. Do not be satisfied with surface
thoughts, or with the delving and mining of others. Dig
deep till the truth comes fresh to your own mind and
heart; for only so will it do you good. Those who have
" Great Controversy " ("Spirit of Prophecy "), Vol. 2, will
find therein great help on many of these lessons. Unfor-
tunately, the book is out of publication, so that copies can-
not be supplied at our publishing houses.

ourselves with Christ? Matt. 19: 29.
                          NOTES.
    I. THE GOSPEL.--Gospel means "good news, tidings,
or words." See Luke 2: 10. The very terms used with
it show the perfect unity of Father and Son, and the char-
acter and power of the gospel. It is called the "gospel
of Christ," as in our lesson; "the gospel of God" (Rom.
  : 1); "the gospel of the grace of God" (Acts zo: 24),
because through the gospel grace or favor is revealed;
"the glorious gospel" (2 Cor. 4:4), because glory is the
end or development of God's grace; " the gospel of
peace " (Eph. 6: 15), because it is God's message of
peace to rebellious creatures; and the " everlasting " or
age-lasting gospel (Rev. 14: 6), for with the ceasing of its
proclamation the probation of man ceases, and his judgl
ment takes place. It is worthy of all study.

   2. Mark, like Luke and Matthew, passes over the first
six months of our Lord's ministry, recorded in John, and
 begins his account after the first passover, and after John
 the Baptist was cast into prison. During these first six
 months after the temptation, from the autumn of A. D. 27
 to the spring of A. D. 28, our Lord wrought the miracle
at Cana of Galilee, and visited Capernaum, from thence'
he had attended the first passover at Jerusalem, cleansed
the temple, taught Nicodemus, visited the woman of
Samaria, and healed the nobleman's son. His public
preaching seems to have begun at this time. Here was
fulfilled the seven weeks and the sixty and two weeks of
Dan. 9: 25, when Messiah the Prince was manifested.

  3. REPENTANCE.—Repentance implies conviction of
sin, contrition of sin, confession of sin, and conversion,
or turning away, from sin. Sin is the transgression of
                  LESSONS ON MARK.                        7

God's holy lakv. I John 3:4; Rom. 7: 7. The gospel is
glad tidings of salvation from sin. But the sinner will
not feel his need of a Saviour unless he is shown that he
is indeed a sinner, and without hope in himself. The
knowledge of sin, however, can be taught only by the
law, "for by the law is the knowledge of sin.' ' Rom. 3:
2o. To preach the gospel, then, one must preach the
law of God. In fact, there is nothing which so empha-
sizes the sacredness of the law of God as the gospel of
Christ. Again, the righteousness of God comes to the
sinner by faith in the gospel, and this righteousness is the
same righteousness that is found in the law, and to which
the law bears witness. Rom. 3:21. The gospel is that
power which is to bring fallen man hack to the right-
eousness of God, Rom.          5, 17; Titus 2: 14.

  4. CALL OF DISCIPLES.—The first disciples which fol-
lowed Jesus were Andrew and Peter. These were 'or-
merl-y disciples of John, who left him and sought Christ
at the beginning of his ministry, returning after a little
time to their old occupation of lashing. The call recorded
by Mark (1:16-2o) and by Matthew (4:18-21) came after
the first passover, when Jesus had returned to Gaiilee.
The second and effectual call is that recorded in Luke
5: I-11. The context, circumstances, and order of events
seem to make this a different call from that recor.led in
our lesson.

  22. In what three ways was Christ's power es-
pecially manifested as shown by this lesson? See
note 7.
                         NOTES.
  I. DIVINE AUTHORITY.—The people were astonished.
because Christ taught as having authority. The word also
means power, or right. The teaching of the scribes was
based on tradition. They had no message from God.
The teaching of Jesus was the truth of God. He was in
the bosom of the Father, and the words that he spake
were the words of God (John 4:31-34), and therefore
it was that they carried conviction to men's hearts.

  2. CHRIST AND SATAN.—The evident design of Satan
in driving the poor demoniac into the synagogue was to
thwart the work of Jesus. The very words Satan put in
his victim's mouth were designed to turn Jesus away: "Let
us alone ; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of
Nazareth? " If the power of Jesus was sufficient to over-
come the evil one, Satan evidently supposed that he
would not heal the man who desired him to depart. But
Jesus had not only power, but compassion; he not only
rebuked the power of Satan, but he restored his victim
to his right mind.

  3. TRADITION.—After the close of the synagogue serv-
ices, the rumor of the casting out of the unclean spirit was
carried through the town. But, bound by the scrupulous
traditions of the unscrupulous Pharisees, the sick could
not be brought till the close of the Sabbath, which was
at even, the setting of the sun. The scribes had gathered
                                              2
10                 LESsoivs og MARA°.

 and elaborated a vast number of senseless precepts, in-
 junctions, and prohibitions covering every phase of life.
 Long rules were given as to just what knots could be tied
 that day. It was forbi:den to write two letters which
 could be read together, either with the right hand or the
 left, of any language, with anything on anything where
 they could be permanent, but they could be written on
 the sand, or any place where they would not remain long.
 It was forbidden to give an emetic on the Sabbath, to set
 a broken bone, or put back a dislocated joint. This was
*the reason they would not bring the sick to Christ on the
 Sabbath. Then the Jews brought all their sick, and the
 compassiohate Healer made them whole. See Geikie's
 oi ally oilier stanuara Lite ot Christ.

  4. THE MAN OF PRAYER. Jesus prayed much. After
working late at night, he rose up a great while before day
to pray (see Mark 2:35; Matt. 24:23; Mark 6:46; Luke
6:12; 9:28, el al.), all night at times; in Gethsem ne's
Garden, on the Mount of Transfiguration, everywhere,
he poured out his soul with strong crying and tears.
Heb. 5:7. If the sinless Son pf God needed to pray,
how much more d6 we, the sinners!

  5. UNSELFISHNEgS.—Not once did Christ work a mir-
acle to save himself personal inconvenience, labor, or
suffering. Not once did a miracle supply his physical
needs. Never did he pause to take a vacation only as
necessity absolutely demanded. He came to save men,
and his soul's burden would not tat him rest while dying
men were waiting to hear and be healed. Oh, how few
are his true followers!

  6. Wisnom.—There 1% as doubtless a threefold object
which our Saviour had in giving his instruction to the
leper: (2) He would show that he was not against the laws
                  LESSONS 0    7   MARK.                11

of Moses; (2) that the priests would have no excuse in
rejecting Christ, for the evidence of his power would be
before them in the cleansed leper; (3) he could better
labor in that vicinity before prejudice was unnecessarily
aroused. The priests could otherwise say that the man
had never been a leper. The rejection of Christ's coun-
sel seems to have shut the gates of the city against him.

  7. THE LESSON.—I. Christ's power and compassion
were manifested in defeating the prince of evil and dark-
ness, in freeing his victim, the demoniac, and restoring
his mind. 2. Christ's power and care for his people were
manifested in healing the relative of a loved disciple. 3.
Christ's power and pity were manifested in the cleansing
of the podr, loathsome wretch, whom no one else would
come near, much less touch. But the finger of power
and the word of the Creator change the putrid flesh to
that of the little child. Who is there that cannot gather
from these incidents precious lessons of faith and trust in
God? Are we willing for Christ to heal and cleanse us?
The power is his, and he will impart it if we only believe.

eousness? Mark 2:21, 22.
                          NOTES.
  I. THE ANSWER OF FAITH.—We are told by Luke
that on this occasion the "power of the Lord was present
to heal." In Matt. 13 :58 it is stated that Christ " did not
many mighty works there because of their unbelief." See
also Mark 6:5, 6. Now if unbelief hindered Christ from
doing mighty works, there must have been the opposite of
unbelief, or faith, present when his mighty power was
manifested. "According to thy faith," and, "All things
are possible to him that believeth, " are sayings of Christ.
Faith in our Lord will always bring his power according
to our needs.

  2. CREATOR AND REDEEMER.—God alone can forgive
sins. God alone by his creative power can restore
broken-down tissues. When Jesus proclaimed as he did
forgiveness to the paralytic, he proclaimed his divinity,
and when he, by his mighty power, healed the man as a
proof of his authority to forgive sin, he demonstrated
that he belonged to the Godhead. This ought to have
been sufficient evidence; but they were blinded by their
unbelief. They could not, with many others, see the
14                     LESSONS ON MARK.

wisdom and power of God as manifested in Jesus of
Nazareth. But to the believer nothing is more precious
than the thought that their Saviour is man as well as God.

  3. WITH SINNERS.—Nothing could more clearly show
the selfishness and hardness of heart of the Pharisees in
the time of Christ than the charges which they brought
against him. "Why, your Master has gone to eat, to
mingle, with the publicans and sinners." There could
be no greater honor than these very words, designed as a
reproof and disgrace. In the fact that Jesus came to call
sinners lies the hope of the world and every soul therein.
Selfish hearts, incrusted and dried up, could not contain
such doctrines, such expansive, blessed truths. They were
like the dried skin .bottles; the new wine would prove
their destruction, unless the heart was changed through
humble contrition and faith. The blind were leading
the blind and realized it not. It is only the truth as it is
in Jesus which can keep us from the same sad condition.

son are so much broken that no attempt is made. to follow it. Matthew
p aces the miracles recorded in Mark 5 :22-43 after the parables of the un-
wrought cloth and new wine. Mark follows that parable by two incidents
of Christ's regard for the Sabbath day (Mark 2:23-27; 3: I-6), in which the
chief points are that Christ as the Creator can best know how the Sabbath
ought to be observed, and that it was in strict harmony with the Sabbath
law to do works of mercy and necessity on that day. And Matthew adds:
"It is lawful to do well on the Sabbath days." Matt. x2:12. This was
confirmed by his creative power in at once restoring the withered hand.

   20. On the other hand, what precious privilege
does he open to all? Mark 3:31-35,
                         NOTES.
  I. DISCIPLE AND APOSTLE.—" Disciple" means a
learner, a follower; one who follows to learn by experi-
ence. "Apostle" means " one sent forth." The twelve
were chosen as learners that they might be sent forth as
heralds and witnesses of Christ. They were called and
chosen as disciples; they were chosen and appointed
(ordained) as apostles. The latter is the official title.
  2. THE ZEAL OF CHRIST.—The eagerness of the people
to hear Jesus was shown by the dense throngs which
were continually crowding round him. It may have
been, and doubtless often was, mere curiosity which
moved many. But Jesus eagerly accepted every oppor-
tunity to instruct; to heal, to save. His eagerness and
zeal were shown in the concern of his friends as regards
his sanity. They could not understand his zeal for God
and his love for souls. He had already said, "My meat
is to do the will of Him that sent me, and to finish his
work." John 4:34. The secret of this is revealed in Ps.
40:8.
                  LESSONS ON MARK. .                    17

  3. REPROACHED WITH CHRIST.—Human nature is the
same in all ages; and as those who have been zealous for
God in past ages have been called foolish, fanatical, and
mad, we may expect the same thing in the last days.
We should not so act as to invite such criticism, neither
should we quench the Spifit of God in our hearts or neg-
lect to obey his word in order to escape it. It will come;
for Isa. 59:15 applies to the last days, as the following
verses show, and Peter (2 Peter 3: 3, 4) confirms the tes-
timony. But if we act wisely and faithfully, we may com-
fort our hearts that we are not in bad company; for so
did the world unto the prophets and the Lord Jesus.

   4. THE PRINCE OF DEMONS.—Beelzebub, or Beelzebul,
is used here as a name for Satan. It means " the master
of the house," the one whom the Jews had admitted.
Its origin is doub less the Old Testament term Baal
Zebub, " the Lord of flies," and, earlier still, the sun-
god. He became the head of the demons, according to
Schaff-Herzog, !` because the fly is an unclean and annoy-
ing thing; and so the connection of Baal with the flies
showed that he was in a sense the most unclean god, and
therefore worthy of the greatest contempt." Those who
 know of the licentiousness of Baal-worship can see an-
other reason for investing the god with a name denoting
 uncleanness and contempt. " Devils " in the New Tes-
 tament does not come from the same word as "the
 devil," referring to Satan. The former comes from dai-
 mon, slightly changed to our demon, while the latter
 comes from ho diabolos, the devil. The devil is prince of
 the demons, his angels. 'Matt. 25: 41. The Pharisees
 declared Christ to be in league with Satan, the prince of
 demons.

  5. SATAN OVERTHROWN.—The d?scription given of Sa-
tan in the Scriptures indicates that aside from divine power
none are -stronger or wiser than he. See Isa. 14: 12-14;
is                 LESSOR'S 0 V MARK.

Eze. 28:12-17. He was cast out of heaven by God (2
Peter 2:4); he was conquered by Christ .(Rev. 12:7-1o;
Luke to: is); he will be bound by a mighty angel at the
beginning of the thousand years (Rev. 2o: 1-3 , and will
finally be destroyed by the power of Christ (Heb. 2: 14; Eze.
28: 18, 19), and to the name of Christ will be all the glory.
His first advent was an advance step toward the great
consummation, when the house of God s earth would be
restored to its pristine glory, and the trail of the serpent
forever removed.
   6. OuTsint OF MERCY.—The only means whereby
man can be purchased and cleansed is the blood of
the Lord Jesus Christ. His change of life and caaracter
is wrought through the word of God by the power of .his
Spirit. To deny one is to deny all; and to deny them is
iv casi from us die only means which God has for saving
us. This everyone does who finally r.jects Christ. The
Jews not only rejected Christ, but with the most conclu-
sive demonstrations of divine power before them, they
dared to say it was a manifestation of Satan. They at-
tributed the work of the Spirit of God to the devil. They
committed the unpardonable sin, for they cut off the
only means of pardon.

heart and good seed. Gal. 6: 7, 8.
                          NOTES.
  I. PARABLES.—Our Lord often gave instructions in,
parables, for several reasons: I. Such instruction would
awaken inquiry, and lead the inquirer to the truth. 2.
Lessons can many times be pressed home more forcibly
in this way, without giving needless offense, than in any
other manner. 3. Jesus could thus teach without hin-
drance many truths necessary at that time; whereas, if
he had declared them in plain language, he would have
been arrested by the Jews and his work would have been
hindered.

  2. How ARE WE DEVELOPED.—The same sun that rip-
ens the wheat for the harvest ripens the noxious plants for /-
the burning. The same laws which prove life and Safety
to the obedient, prove destruction to the transgressor.
Hosea 14:9. So with these truths spoken by Christ. To
the willing-hearted, to the humble, to the meek, to those
                  LESSONS ON MARX.                     21

who were seeking them, they came as precious instruc-
tion; but to those who had closed their eyes and ears,
to those whose heart had waxed gross through selfish-
ness, these words of Christ would only the more deeply
condemn because spoken in their hearing. Matt. 13: 12
may be paraphrased to read thus: ',Tor whosoever hath
[obtained some grace and truth by seeking], to him shall
be given, and he shall have more abundantly; but who-
soever bath not [obtained the grace and light of God by
earnestly seeking therefor], from him shall be taken
away even that [which] he [now] hath."

  3. THE SUPERFICIAL.—Are the stony ground hearers
necessary?—Not at all. The parable takes the soil as it
finds it,—a class of people quite numerous. When it
looks as though all would accept the truth, and it seems
popular, they accept it with joy for the good they will get
instead of the good they will do. They do not think or
dig deep. They love what they hope the truth will bring
them rather than what it will do for them if they will sub-
mit to it. They are prepared for sensuous ease, enjoy-
ment, and blessing, but not for trial, hardship, and the
greater, richer blessings and privileges which come by
suffering for the truth's sake.. Therefore, not being armed
for this (I Peter 4: I), when tribulation or persecution
ariseth because of the truth, they are offended—they stum-
ble. See Revised Version. " Great peace have they
which love thy law, and they have no stumbling-block."
 Ps. 119: 165, margin.

  4. THE DOUBLE MINDED.—The thorny-ground hear-
ers are a class who desire to retain the world and the
truth both. They are not so numerous as the class be-
fore them; but there are many such in the churches.
They did not think it worth while to root out the thorns.
They wished the truth and they wished the world too.
22                 LESSONS 01V

But the thorns grow more rapidly in their native soil
than the, good seed, so that whenever a plant of truth
would spring up, it is choked by the thorns. "The cares
of the world" by some, " the deceitfulness of riches " by
others, "the pleasures of this life" by a third class, "the
lusts of other things" in all, choke out the word, it be-
  s unfruitful, orsieif, perchance, a tree shoots up, and
come
fruit starts on its branches, it does not come to perfec-
tion. Compare with Luke. In the above classes God
wants the fallow ground broken up, the stones gathered
out, the thorns uprooted. Let the heart be broken be-
fore God, let it be cleansed by the blood of ChriA, and
then let the honest and good heart receive the good seed,
and the fruit will be unto holiness, and the end everlast-

                         NOTES.
   I. THE KINGDOM.—The kingdom of God does not ex-
ist here. This earth will not be the kingdom of God till
Christ shall come. Matt. 25:3 r. But the subiects of that
kingdom are yet here. God is gathering them out. That
work is the work of the kingdom of God, the work of the
King on the throne of grace, and it is therefore called the
kingdom of God, the kingdom of heaven, etc.

  2. THE OTHER SIDE.—These parables were spoken, as
all are agreed, in the vicinity of Capernaum. To the
other side would, therefore, be to the east side of the Sea
of Galilee, to the country of Gadara. Mark 5: 1.

   3. THE ALARMED DISCIPLES.—In the appeal of the
disciples to Christ, each of the evangelists uses different
words. Probably all their expressions were used. The
first, " Lord, save us; we perish" (Matthew) is the lan-
guage of earnest appeal and alarm, but the Master sleeps
on; then comes, "Master, carest thou not that we per-
ish? " the language of impatience and reproachful en-
treaty; and finally the language of almost despair, "Mas-
ter, Master, we perish! " How small their faith! They
had accepted him as the Christ of God, and yet in times of
severe danger their faith faltered and failed. But Jesus
in his compassion gives them another evidence of his di-
vine power; he shows them that—
                   LESSONS ON MARK.                   25

      "Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea,
       Or demons, or men, or whatever it be,
       No water shall swallow the ship where lies
       The Master of ocean, or earth, or skies; .
           They all shall sweetly obey My will,
           Peace, peace, be still."
                                                    •
• it evidently was Satan's object to destroy Jesus by the
  fearful storm which he, as "prince of the power of the
  air," was permitted to bring. But he could not, neither

  24. What effect did the man's preaching have
upon the people?—Ib.
                         NOTES.
  I. THE DEMONIAC.—Matthew says that there were two
men possessed with demons; Mark and Luke say one.
There is no contradiction. One was doubtless more
prominent than the other, and Mark and Luke mention
this one.

  2. THE TIME OF JUDGMENT.—As the:demoniac came
into the presence of Christ, he seemed to realize that
there was help for him, so he fell down before him in the
attitude of worship. The demons within him also real-
ized the power of Christ, and when their poor victim at-
tempted tospeak, they put their own words in his mouth,
and plead for themselves that they might not be tor-
mented before "the time"—the great day of God's
executive judgment, which they know is sure to come.
One demon seems to have been mouthpiece for all.

  3. SWINE VERSUS SOULS.—The Lord permitted the
demons to possess the swine; in thus doing a human soul
was set free. Satan's object was to destroy Christ, or,
failing in that, his influence. The destruction of the
swine did, for a time, affect the latter. But Christ left a
living witness of his power to save. Before they knew
Christ, the swine was more precious in their eyes than a
redeemed soul. But the life of the restored demoniac
brought the people to their senses, and led them to better
appreciate the worth of the gospel of Christ.

4. CALLED TO SERVICE —It would certainly have been
more pleasant for the restored man to have remained
with Christ; but great blessings bring great obligations.
As Christ had released him from the bondage of Satan,
28                LESSONS ON MARK..

he became Christ's servant, and it was therefore his duty
to do Christ's work. Jesus told him to "go home
to thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord
hath done for thee, and bath had compassion on thee."
This he cheerfully did, and the result was that those who
would not accept Jesus in person because they did not
know him, listened with wonder as he was lifted up in
the life and testimony of the restored demoniac. 'There
is no testimony so powerful as that which comes from a
heart which has been cleansed from sin by the power of
Christ. Let us ever remember, as taught by this lesson,
that Christ calls us and cleanses us for service.

                         NOTES.
  I. THE Toucx OF FAITH.—The disciples could not
understand the difference between the selfish and curi-
ous crowding of the multitude and the touch of faith; but
Jesus could. It was not the mere touch that healed,
neither was it the clothes of Christ; it was the power of
Christ in response to the faith of the woman. Faith has
been defined as "the soul's grasp of Christ's power to
save," and here was its manifestation. She saw by faith
the healing already accomplished, she appropriated the
boon desired by manifesting her faith. There is all the
difference between the prayer of faith and the formal
prayer as between the touch of faith and the casual touch.
The world may see no more difference in the mere words
of the prayer than they do in the contact of the touches:
But the prayer of true faith lays hold of the power of
God even. as the touch of faith brought virtue from
Christ.

  2. RAISING OF JAIRUS' DAUGHTER.—That she was•
dead the people knew. That she would surely•wake as
though asleep He to whom all power is given also knew.
He spoke of things that were not as though they were,
for in his powei and purpose they were facts. He simply
"spake, and it was done." The spirit—the breath of life
—given by God, came back at the command of Him who
had first given it to man, and the daughter lived again.
The words " Tali tha cumi," "Maiden, arise," were spirit
and life because spoken by the Lord of life.

                           NOTES.
   I. THEY STUMBLED.—The margin of the Revised Ver-
sion reads in Mark 6 :3 that the Jews of Nazareth " were
caused to stumble." Their hearts were at first open to
receive his wonderful words; but Satan suggested doubts.
He called to their mind Jesus' residence with them,
how he had wrought at his trade, had moved in and
out among them as one of the people, and they could
not bear to think that one of their number was greater
than were they. Who can stand before envy (Prov. 27:
4) if it is in the power of the one who envies to destroy?
It was the same spirit which sod Joseph into Egypt that
                   LESSONS ON MARK.                       33

at Nazareth rejected Christ. At Capernaum they ac-
cepted him, at Nazareth he was forced to flee for his life.
To one he was precious (i Peter 2 : 7; Matt. It : 6); to the
other, a stone of stumbling ( I Peter 2: 8). But the cause of
offense was in their own heart. The temptation of Satan
was but the occasion.
   2. JOHN THE BAPTIST'S DEATH.—Herod Antipas (te-
trarch of Galilee from B. C. 4 to A. D. 39) was the slayer
of John the Baptist. He was son of Herod the Great by
his fourth wife, Malthace. Like his father, he was ambi-
tious and ostentatious. His first wife was the daughter
of King Aretas; but her he divorced in order to marry
Herodias, the wife of Herod Philip, his brother, an am-
bitious and profligate woman who was not content with
the private lift of her husband. The adulterous union
between Antipas and Herodias was rebuked by John the
 Baptist. Herod's superstitious nature seems to have
been somewhat in fear tinder the faithful preaching of
John, but the rage of Herodias Was aroused, and her
 cruel, cunning playing on the sensuous and pleasure-
 loving nature of the king, accompliThed the death of
John the Baptist and finally the ruin of her husband. In
 the case of these two, Herodias and John, we can find
 comfort in Eccl. 8 : it, 12.
   3. RASH OATHs.—Boothroyd's translation of Lev. 5:
  , 5 may help the reader to a clearer understanding of
the text: " Or if a person have sworn rashly, from pro-
nouncing with his lips, to do evil, or to do good ( what-
soever it be that a, man may rashly pronounce with an
oath), and it be hid from him; yet when he knoweth
that he is guilty in any way of these things, and that by
any of these things he bath become guilty, he shall con-
fess the sin which he hath committed; and shall bring his
guilt-offering," etc. Herod was verily gui ty and was
exempt from his rash oath. Of course this is not under-
stood to refer to solemn vows before God. There are
other scriptures which give instruction with reference to
vowing. But a rash oath or a bad promise which in-
volves sin or injury to another in its fulfillment is better
 broken than kept.

    27. What should be the object of all? Verse 27.
                         NOTES.
  I. SEEKING   REST.—The natural tendency of the human
heart is to become impatient. when hindered in its object.
Jesus needed rest'and refreshment, but as he looked upon
36                 LESSONS ON MARK. '

the vast multitude who were perishing and dying for the
want of the bread of life, his great heart of love and pity
was touched, and he turns from his own desires, begot-
ten by actual physical necessities, to feed the multitude
with the bread of life, finding his own foo 1 the while in
doing the will of. God. John 4: 34. This was the spirit
of the Master. " If any man have not the Spirit of Christ,
he is none of his."

   2. THE CASH IN THE TREASURY.—When our Saviour
ordered the disciples to feed the multitude, they asked
him, according to Mark, "Shall we go and buy two hun-
dred pennyworth of bread, and give them to eat?" Then
follows Philip's statement, recorded by John: "Two hun-
dred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them that
every one of them may take a little." The Roman penny
was worth about seventeen cents, and the sum in the
treasury of the disciples probably amounted to just two
hundred times that, or about thirty-lour dollars. The
multitude probably numbered not less than to,000, and
Philip's statement, from a natural point of view, was a
correct one. But one loaf was sufficient in the hands of
the Master. His creative power furnished what was
wanted, " exceeding abundantly above all " that was
thought. He is the same Jesus yesterday, to-day, and
all. days to come.

  3. THE BASKETS.—" Twelve baskets" (Greek kophi-
nos), probably one each for the twelve disciples. It de-
noted a small wicker basket, of which each man may
have carried one. In Mark 8:8, 20 a. different Greek
word (spuris) is translated basket, meaning a large bas-
ket, or hamper, such as Paul was let down in from the
window. Acts 9:25.

                          NOTE.
   THEY WERE OFFENDED.—"Caused to stumble" (Re-
vised Version, margin). Reproof either leads to repent-
ance or to rebellion. The object in giving it should al-
ways be to help the individual if possible; but whatever
the object or motive in the one who gives it, we should
always receive it with humility of heart. If we have done
wrong, let there be hearty repentance and gratitude to
God that• he has thought us worthy of reproof. If we
are innocent, we have cause of gratitude that he has kept
us. In either case we should not be offended at the one
who gives the reproof. If we are guilty, we deserve it.
If it is given unjustly, the one who gave it should be pit-
ied rather than hated. No power outside of our own heart
can make us stumble. (See note to lesson 9.) " Great
peace have they that love thy law, and they shall have
no stumbling-block." Ps. 119:165, margin. All wrong

feelings or motives cherished in the heart, all institutions
of error in existence, will sometime be rooted up. If we
put them away and renounce them, we will escape the
destruction; but if we identify ourselves with them, we
will, as a part of the evil, be rooted up with it.

a dog to the strict Jews, belonged to those "other sheep"
of which our Saviour spoke (John ro: 16), who were lost
to the fold of Israel. It was a part of Christ's mission to
gather them into the fold of the true Israel of-God. This
woman was, as is everyone who longs after God, one of
the lost sheep of the house of Israel, whom the Son of
God came to save. See Eph. 2: II, 12, 19, 20.

    2. THE GREAT MIgSIONARV.—The journey to the
 coasts of Tyre and Sidon was between forty and fifty
 miles. Our Lord went there and returned immediately,
  having done nothing but to heal the woman's daughter.
- He even seemed to slight her feelings, but he was draw-

 ing out her faith, and developing within her soul strength
  and perseverance of character. It is a wonderful lesson
  of faith exemplified in the conduct of the woman, and it
 is also a wonderful evidence of Christ's knowledge, love,
 and power to help any soul, in any place or condition, which
  desires his help and presence. As he was to the woman
  of Canaan, so will he be to everyone who realizes his own
  need and exercises faith in God.

  3. ACCORDING TO OUR NEED.—We may learn among
other lessons that Christ's knowledge recognizes our ne-
cessities, that his power is sufficient to supply our need,
even to create if necessary,.and that his love will do it. We
should learn that the fact that he has blessed us and come
to our need in the past is an evidence that he will in the
present. When the four thousand are in need, let us not
forget the miracle of the five thousand.

                       NOTES.
   I. ASKING A SIGN.—"A wicked and adulterous gener-
ation seeketh after a sign." We have no instance of one
soul's accepting Christ because He wrought a sign for the
seeking. God always gives sufficient evidence to him
who desires to know and do God's will. "If any man
willeth to do His will, he shall know of the teaching."
John 7:17, Revised Version, margin. The foundation of
faith is a pure heart. The foundation of unbelief and•
infidelity is a heart which loves sin. Intellect has but lit-
tle to do with it.

  2. THOU ART PETER.—The assurance was that as God
had revealed the truth to him that Jesus was Christ, so
would he.build upon that truth confessed by Peter, and
that Rock, which was the incarnation of all truth, his
church, against which the gates of hell, lades, should
not prevail. Just so long, therefore, as one holds to such
foundation, so long will he stand against all the powers
of the enemy. The word " Peter" comes from ftetros,
meaning a stone. "Rock" comes from Petra, meaning
rock, but never stone. The stone, Peter, is built upon
44                LESSONS ON MARK.

the Rock, Christ. See I Peter 2:4-8. The binding and
the loosing doubtless had reference to the same great
truth. He who confessed Christ would be loosed from
sin; he who rejected him would be bound and lost. See
No. 63 Bible Students' Library," The Sure Foundation."

  3. THE THINGS OF THE WORLD.—Peter's remark,
which on the surface seemed so kindly meant, was based
on the veriest selfishness. He had identified himself
with Jesus, and he knew that if Jesus was to suffer, it
would involve him also in the humiliation. Our Lord
discerned his, spirit and properly rebuked him. The plan
of salvation was laid in the self-denial of love. We can
be partakers in that plan only as we partake of the same
spirit.

make another volume equal to or exceeding in interest the first.
