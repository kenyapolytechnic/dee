                               THE



 IIFE AND                t     OROS OF CHRIST,
            BY CUNNINGHAM GBINIE, D. B.



        E have quite a stock of the above book on hand,
     la and they will be especiallyuseful to those who
        are now studying the Sabbath-school lessons on
         the Gospel of Mark.
  As to the'plan of the work, we quote from the author's
preface:—
    "I have tried in this book to restore, as far as I could, the world
 in which Jesus moved; the country in which he lived; the people
 among whom he grew up and ministered; the religion in which he
 was trained; . . . • the events, social, religious, and political, not
 mentioned in the Gospels, that formed the history of his lifetime,
•so far as they can be recovered.
    "In this picture, he, himself, is, of course, the central figure, to
 which all details are subordinate. . .        All his sayings and dis-
 courses are given in full, for a life in which he is not his own inter-
 preter, most be:defective.'
    "No one can feel more keenly than myself how open such a book
 must be to criticism. Where the best and wisest have differed, I
 could not expect that all will agree with me, and I cannot hope to
 have escaped oversights, or even errors, in treating a subject so ex-
 tensive. I can only plead my honest desire for truth and correctness,
 in mitigation of judgment."
  This is a cheap edition of the " Life of Christ," but is
quite well printed and bound in cloth. The book con-
thins 826 pages, and will be sent postpaid for 50 cents.

              NOTES ON THE LESSON.
  I. QUESTION   4.—Moses and Elias (Elijah) were talking
with Jesus. Luke tells us what they were talking about.
They conversed with our Lord of his sufferings, sympa-
thizing with and comforting him in view of the trial which
awaited him, and cheering him with the assurance of cer-
tain triumph over sin and death. Jesus designed all this
to be a support to the disciples as they came to that try-
ing hour. This manifestation of glory came in answer to
the earnest prayers of. Jesus.

  2. QUESTION 6.—Peter not only knew "not what to
say," but he understood not what he said. Ile evidently
thought that the heavenly guests would abide with theft).
He understood not the nature of the kingdom.

   3. QUESTION 11.—The evident reason for thus charg-
ing the disciples was that no other evidences of his.
divinity should be .brought to bear upon the people but
what was manifest before all. The apostles, not under-
standing the nature of Christ's kingdom, would be cer-
tam ti give it a wrong interpretation, and thus they
would spread error rather than truth. They were. , to
wait till the Scripture was opened unto them. Luke
2 4: 45.

  4. QUsTtoist 14.—There will he two classes of subjects
gathered home to the kingdom of Christ when he comes.
The first will be those who are raised from the dead.
6                LESSONS ON MARK:

Moses was a type of this class, and was raised as a pledge
cf the resurrection. This is indicated not only by the
design of the vision, but by Jude 9. In a dispute over
the body of the servant of God between Christ (Michael)
and Satan there could be but one result,—the Son of God
would be victorious. The second class will be those
translated without seeing death, represented by Elijah,
who was thus taken to heaven. 2 Kings 2:11.

   21. With what illustration and injunction does
he show the necessity of having the inward life as
it should be? Verses 49, 5o. See note 4.

               NOTES ON THE LESSON.
  I. QUESTION I.—The reason why Jesus would have no
one know of his passing through, evidently, only that part
of Galilee lying north of Capemaum, was that he might
not be delayed on his way to more important fields, and
that he might have opportunity of instructing his disciples
when alone with them.

   2. QUESTION .9.—There is no more precious grace in
the eyes of the Lord than true humility; and there is a
reason for this, for he who has a low opinion of his own
wisdom, his own righteousness, his own strength, will
Seek the wisdom and righteousness and strength of Gcd.
Hence the high and lofty One dwells with the humble
and contrite ones, to revive an encourage them. Isa. 57:
15; 66:2. The truest wisdom is that which is of the great-
est use; and as in the way of righteousness alone is eter-
nal life found, so that wisdom which leads to righteous-
ness is the greatest wisdom So while man may not
glory in the wisdom, and might; and riches of the world,
he may glory in that which is infinitely greater—the knowl-
edge of God, who exercises `! loving-kindness, judgment,
and righteousness, in the earth; for in these things I de-
light, saith the Lord," and the knowledge of God is re-
vealed in the meek and lowly. Ps. 25:9, 14; 139:6. The
smallest in their own sight are greatest in the eyes of the
                   LESSONS ON MARK.                          9

Lord; for these only can, he make great. The greatest
faith is that which believes all which God says without
question; and true faith is inseparably connected with that
love which keeps all the commandments of God. Gal.
5: 6. True greatness in God's eyes is, therefore, wise,
faithful, loving service, a losing of one's self in the will of
God.

  3. QUESTION 20.—" Offend," in verses 42, 43, 45, and
47, should be translated as in the Revised Version, "cause
to stumble," " Whosoever shall cause one of these little
ones that believe on me to stumble," etc., and, "If thy
hand cause thee to stumble," etc. It is not to be under-
stood that the hand, or the foot, or the eye, should be lit-
erally cut off or pluCked out; for these members but
follow the desire of the heart and command or assent of
the will. But we should sever from us everything which
would cause us to stumble, even though it be as clear as a
hand or foot or eye. This is true as a church, it is true
as individuals. "The fire that never shall be quenched"
ought to be, as in the Revised Version, simply "unquench-
able fire," that is, fire which cannot be quenched till it
consumes what it has preyed upon, the worm which does
not die till it has devoured the carcasses and there is no
more left. An example of this unquenchable fire is given
in the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple. See Jer.
17:27; compare with 2 Chron. 36:19, 2I; or Jude 7 with 2
Peter 2:6. In both cases the fire burned up, and then
went out. The word " hell " comes from Ge-enmz, the
Valley of Hinnom, a place outside of Jerusalem where
the dead carcasses of malefactors and all manner of filth
and rubbish were cast. Here worms preyed upon it, and
what was left was consumed by the fires which were kept
constantly burning. The word is therefore used as sym-
bolical of the punishment.of the wicked, denoting -utter
and final destruction:

   4. QUESTION 21.—The necessity of the inward work of
grace on the heart is shown by verses 49, 5o. Salt is
known for its power to preserve. In this sense it is a
symbol of righteousness. It matters not what the deed
is, the inward motive, the state of the soul, the inner
life, is what determines its worth. If righteousness is
not in the heart of the believer, he is like salt without salt-
ness.

               NOTES ON THE LESSON.
   I. QUESTION I.—Between the events of this lesson and
our last conies in what is recorded in chapters tot() 18: 14
in Luke and chapters 7 to to in John.

  2. QUESTION 10.—God only is absolute good; if, there-
fore, Jesus was good of himself, he was of God and di-
vine. The young man's address was doubtless only
designed to be respectful; Jesus used it to convey a lesson
which would be of eternal worth if studied.

  3. QUESTION 15.—The young man had kept the law,
doubtless, as did Paul. He had observed it outwardly,
not realizing that the principles of love on which it was
based demanded his all. His Wealth was his god, his
morality was his pride, and he knew it not. He was
really a transgressor of the first commandment, and there-
fore of the whole law, for it is one law. The law demands
all-absorbing love, and love gives all.

  4. QUESTION zo.—The words of Jesus show the great
danger and powerful snare of riches. Of course, it is
only by the power of God that any can he saved, but it •
would require more of God's power to enable the rich
man to relinquish his idol, or break the cords that bind
him to the world in so many ways. The proverb con-
cerning the camel and the eye of a needle was a common
proverb among the orientals to denote an impossibility.
For " they that will be rich fall into temptation and a
snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which
drown men in destruction and perdition." I Tim. 6: 9.
To those whose heart is set on riches there is no way to
escape its snares.- The only hope of the rich is to
yield all to God. They are then no longer rich in this
world's goods but poor for Christ's sake.

              NOTES ON THE LESSON.
  T. QuEsTioN I.—Intervening between this and the last
lesson are the events and teaching of Luke 19:1-27 and
Jonn 12:        The parable of the pounds was given to
correct the erroneous ideas in regard to the kingdom of
Christ. Certainly the disciples could not say our Lord
had deceived them.

  2. QUESTION 3.'---They looked not only for the king-
dom of God to appear, but they recognized Christ as the
King. There seemed also to he a general recognition of
his earthly ancestry. See Matt. 9:27; 20: 30; 5:22.

  3. QuEs-rioN 8.—The testimony of the people did not
seem to be the strong conviction of faith; rather, it was
pressed upon them by coining under the influence of the
Spirit of God, just as Saul prophesied. See 1 Sam. 19:
19-24. Abiding faith dwells only in regenerated, sancti-
fied hearts.

   4. QUESTION 15.—The barren fig tree was a fit repre-
sentative of the Jewish nation and temple worship. Their
gorgeous temple, elaborate ritual, and high profession,
fitly accorded with the leaves of the fig tree, which do
not appear till after the figs. That tree said by its leaves,
"You will find fruit here." The Jews said to all sur-
rounding them, " We are the people of God. Here you
will find true worship." Jesus came to his vineyard but
found no fruit (Luke 13: 6-9), and his curse rested upon
the cumberer of the ground. He came to his own, and
his.own received him not. John 1: It; Luke 19:14.

               NOTES ON THE LESSON. -
  I. QUESTION 5.—There are always features in every
parable which will not fit the case to which the parable
in general applies, for it is impossible that any material
thing should perfectly represent the spiritual. It is not
best, therefore, to spend the time in trying to make every
detail fit somewhere. We have the chief characters and
features in the householder, his vineyard, which he let to
husbandmen, his servants, and his son. There are cer-
tain other features which are also fitting. The tower
which was built in the vineyard doubtless applies to the
temple; the hedge round about it, to the holy laws, rites,
and ceremonies which separated Israel from the world;
                  LESSONS ON MARK.


the place for the wine-fat is evidently Jerusalem. But
here it is well to pause. The going into the far country
and the receiving of fruit at a specified time are consist-
ent with the parable, but they are not designed to have
any special application, further than this, that God looked
for his people to bring forth fruits all the way along. A
parable is not designed to apply in every particular.
The great practical lesson should be the thing which we
should seek to understand, not the detail of the parable.

   2. QUESTION 13.-It seems by comparing the different
accounts, that Jesus first asked the question, "What shall
therefore the lord of the vineyard do?" The people,
carried along by the manner and eloquence of Jesus, and
not realizing the application of the parable, are con-
strained to reply: "He will miserably destroy those
wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other
hffsbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their
seasons." Jesus then repeats the solemn sentence which
the Jews, in their sense of justice, had pronounced: "He
shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give
the vineyard to others." They see then its application
and its force, and reply, " Let it not be;" they would
have it otherwise. This must not come upon the holy
nation. This protest Jesus meets by quoting from their
own Scriptures. Luke brings this out with peculiar force.
Jesus paused, looked upon them, and said, " What is
this then that is written?" Luke zo: 17. "Have ye
not read this scripture: "The stone which the builders
rejected is become the head of the corner? " It is only
as we combine the accounts of the evangelists, many
times, that we get the full force and beauty of Christ's
teaching.

               NOTES ON THE LESSON.
  I. QUESTION 4.—The Sadducees were the higher
critics, or religious infidels, of their time. They accepted
the writings of Moses, but for the most part rejected the
other Scriptures, holding that there would be no resur-
rection. They brought to Jesus one of their stock cavils,
one of the hard theological nuts, so to speak, with which
they had so often silenced the Pharisees. Jesus first tells
them their error, and shows them that they limit God's
power. He then from the writings which the Sadducees
                  LESSONS ON MARK.                      g3

professed to believe showed that there would be a resur-
rection. He takes for the basis of his argument a truth
admitted by all that God is a God of the living. It would
be no glory to be the God of the dead; for death came
by sin. But in the writings of Moses, God calls himself
"the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God
of Jacob." Now all knew that these men were dead and
buried; how, then, could God be the God of the living in
being their God?—For the very simple reason that in
God's purpose they still lived, for he would raise them
from the dead. He calls those things that are not as
though they were (Rom. 4: 17), for in his purpose they
are. If the souls of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were in
heaven, and God called himself their God and the God
of the living because their souls were there, the words of
Christ were the veriest nonsense. Jesus quoted the
Scripture to prove that "as touching the dead, that they
rise;" and that he did prove it, the tacit admission of the
Sadducees bears witness.

              NOTES ON THE LESSON.
   I. QUESTION 3.—The disciples asked these questions,
the answers to which can be fully comprehended only by
comparing and combining the three accounts of this re-
markable prophetic discourse. The first question related
to the destruction of the temple, the second to the second
coming of Christ, and the third to the end of the world,
or age, when probation closed. Matthew, and Mark also,
proceeds to answer the last question first. Matt. 24:1-
14; Mark 13: 1-13. Then he takes up the destruction of
Jerusalem (Mark 13: 14-18), and from that destruction of
the Jews he proceeds to the greater affliction of the peo-
ple of God during the Dark Ages, and thence to Christ's
second coming.
  2. QUESTION r1.-" Those days," of verses 19 and 20,
refer to the time of the greatest persecution the people
                  LESSONS ON MARK.

of God ever suffered or ever will suffer. This persecu-
tion began during the reign of Pagan Rome, but culmi-
nated in the great Papal tribulation of 126o years, be-
tween 538 and 1798 A. D.

   3. QUESTION 14.—Matthew says the darkening of the
sun was to take place "immediately after the tribulation
of those days." Mark says, " In those days, after that
tribulation." The ending of the tribulation of the days
is well marked: (f) By the decree of toleration promul-
gated by Maria Theresa, empress of Austria, in 1776; and
(2) by opening to the oppressed of the world free and in-
dependent America. The first sign—the darkening of
the sun—must, therefore, occur between 1776 and 1798;
and it did occur four years after the tribulation ceased,
May 19, 1780. The obscuration of the sun came at the
very time indicated by the prophecy, and was regarded
by scientific men as beyond their power to explain, and
by religious men as a sure precursor of Christ's second
coming. The darkening of the moon occurred the next
night. The falling of the stars took place in 1833, No-
vember 13.

   24. After the supper ended, what was done?
Mark 14:26.
              NOTES ON THE LESSON.
  I. QUESTION 10.-It   would seem from Luke that at the
passover supper a strife took place among the disciples as
to which should be the greatest. This may have been
manifested by their positions at the table. After the
opening words and ceremony (Luke 22: 14-I8), Jesus
arose from the Passover supper and washed his disciples
feet, instituting an ordinance of humility, as recorded in
John 13.
  2. QUESTION 16.—The very passovei supper at which
our Lord and his disciples were sitting, was the last
legitimate one which would ever be celebrated. Its
origin is recorded in Exodus 12, at the time when the
angel of wrath smote the firstborn of Egypt and 'Sassed
over the houses of those who had sprinkled, tnie bloocl
                   LESSONS ON MARK.

the passover lamb on the doorcasing. Jesus is our pass-
over, and if our sins are covered by his blood in the day of
God's fierce anger, no evil will befall us, no plague will
come near our dwelling. The passover lamb, without
spot or blemish, of which a bone was not broken, typified
the Lamb of God, whose blood was shed for all.
  3. QUESTION 17.—It is quite difficult to place in chrono-
logical order the events of the passover night. " It seems
evident that what is recorded in Luke 22: 31-38, and
John 13:31 to the close of chapter 14, took place just
after Judas went out. That warning to Peter would be a
distinct and prior warning to that recorded in Mark.
The "Arise, and let us go hence;" of John 14:31, would
be uttered just after the Lord's. Supper, just before leav-
ing for Gethsemane.
  4. QUESTION 20.—In John 6: 53, 54 we are told that, ex-
cept we eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of
God, we have no life in us, and that if we do this we have
eternal life. Jesus says in the same chapter, verse 63, that
the flesh profiteth nothing; the words that he speaks are
spirit and life. Christ's sufferings in the flesh were in our
behalf (Col. 1:21, 22; I Tim. 3:16; 1-leb. 5;y; I Peter
2:24); his blood was shed for the guilty (I Peter 1: 18, 19),
and he has promised that all who have persOnal faith in
this offering shall have eternal life (John 3:16). It is
through faith in the promise and power of Christ that
we become "partakers of the divine nature," that we
have eternal life. 2 Peter 1: 4. God is no respecter of
persons; he will give life freely to all who will believe.
  5. QUESTION 23.—The two • greatest events in the
history of the race are brought to mind in the Lord's
Supper. We are carried back to his humiliation, his
labors, his suffering, his agony, his death; and we are
carried forward "till lie come," when he will come forth
and serve his people at the marriage supper of the Lamb.

32                 LESSONS ON MARK.

               NOTES ON THE LESSON.
  1. QUESTION 4.—The solemn, tender assurance, warn-
ing, and instruction given to Peter by the Lord, as re-
corded in Luke 22: 31-34, seems to be one phase of the
same conversation as recorded in John 13: 36-38, and oc-
curred before the Lord's Supper. This conversation re-
corded in Matthew and Mark took place on the way to
Gethsemane.

   2. QUESTION 12.—There were two petitions in the
prayer of Christ: (1) "Take away this cup from me " (2)
"Nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt."
The first was in his mind of secondary importance; the
second petition was primary. He longed for the first;
he shrank from the ordeal with an agony that forced
from his pores great drops of blood; but he longed for
the second more. The first petition was not answered;
the second and important petition was; and hence his
prayer was answered. Such should be the prayer of
every follower of Jesus. Whatever difficulty, trial, afflic-
tion, or cross lies before us, while we pray for its removal,
let us pray above all that God's will may be done. Our
prayers will then never go unanswered, and we may
know that God's will is best. Believing this, we may
say with all our heart, "0 my Father, if this cup may not
pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done."
Matt. 26: 42. Only in so doing is there peace.
             "God pity those who cannot say,
             `Not mine, but thine,' who only pray,
             `Let this cup pass,' who do not see
              The purpose in Gethsemane."

  3. QUESTION 13.—As Jesus comes to his disciples, whom
he had entreated to watch with him, he finds them sleep-
ing. While gently reproving Peter, he yet frames an ex-
cuse for their sleeping. The spirit was ready, but the
                   LESSONS ON MARK.                      33

flesh .weak. But the third time when he comes, the
struggle is over, the victory won. He longs for their
companionship in watching no longer; they may sleep on
and take their rest. It is enough; the hour of agony was
over. But even as he speaks, the footsteps of the mob
are heard, and Jesus says, " Rise up, let us go; lo, he that
betrayeth me is at hand."
  4. QUESTION 22.—"And they all forsook him, and fled."
This is just what Jesus had warned them of, that all would
be offended because of him. All had denied it, but the
words of the Master were true. How little do men know
of what is in their own heart. Jesus was left alone, and
yet he was not alone, for the Father was with him. John
16:32.

   27. For what was Jesus condemned by Pilate?
See note 6.
               NOTES ON THE LESSON.
   1. QUESTION 6.—The arraignment before Annas, the
greatest enemy of Jesus, does not seem to have been
satisfactory to the fiery priest. The Revised Version
reads John 18:24 thus: "Annas therefore sent him bound
to Caiaphas, the high priest." He was not satisfied with
.\ts results; he therefore sent him to his son-in-law. Cai-
36                LESSONS ON MARK.

aphas may have been in the same palace. Both Annas
and Caiaphas are called high priest. See Luke 3: 2; Acts
4: 6. Annas is supposed by some to have been president
of the Sanhedrin.

   2. QUESTION 7.—The priests and rulers were so de-
ceived by the devil that all sense of justice seemed to be
lost. The devil led them to reason, no doubt, that the
end—putting Christ to death—justified the means—the
way in which he was condemned. They therefore sought
not simply for witnesses against him, but for false wit-
nesses. Matt. 26:59. They did even worse; if possible,
in the case of Stephen; they suborned hired men, to tes-
tify against him. Acts 6: 11.

  3. QUESTION 15.—This was the formal and regular trial
and condemnation. The Jews, according to law, could
not condemn a prisoner in the night unless the trial had
lasted through the day previous. It is hardly to be sup-
posed that previous to this the Sanhedrin had been reg-
ularly summoned.

  4. QUESTION FT—The former trials were to satisfy
the Jews., They had no right to sentence Jesus to death,
much less to execute the sentence. He was condemned
as worthy of death, not because he called himself •the
Messiah, but because he said he was the Son of God.
He must be sentenced by the Roman governor if he was
to die; and they therefore accuse him before Pilate of .
treason, of setting himself up as a king in the place of
Clesar. Pilate's "Take ye him, and judge him according
to your law," brought but the fact that they were deter-
mined to put Jesus to death. John 18:31.

  5. QUESTION 23.—The limited space of one lesson will
not permit the bringing in of the wonderfully interesting
                  LESSONS ON MARK.                      37

details of the trial of Jesus. The narrative will endure
all the study which the student may be able to put upon
it, and new light and new phases will flash upon him at
every turn. It would be interesting to bring out what
led the people to choose as they did, how each step
Pilate took led him farther and farther into the power of
the priests, how he tried to cleanse himself from guilt,
how he was warned of God, how he repeatedly tried to
set Jesus free, appealing both to their sense of justice
and pity, but how at last he felt compelled to yield or
lose his position, etc., etc.; but much of this the student
must seek out for himself.

  6. QUESTION 27.—Jesus was condemned by Pilate for
treason or rebellion against the Roman Government.
Pilate would have, no doubt, released him if it had not
been for the last argument brought by the Jews: " If
thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar's friend; whoso-
ever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar."
Although Pilate knew that Jesus did not design to usurp
the earthly power of any, that his kingdom was not of
this world, he also knew that the unscrupulous priests
would not stop at any measure to accomplish their end,
and that they would work his own ruin if he did not con-
demn Jesus. He, therefore, gave sentence as they re-
quired, and condemned him for setting himself up as
King of the Jews. See Mark is: 26.

               NOTES ON THE LESSON.

   I. QUESTION 2.—The scourging and crowning with
 thorns took place before Jesus was delivered to be
 crucified. See John 19:          Pilate presents Jesus be-
 fore the Jews while undergoing these sufferings, and
 endeavors to move their pity. After delivering him to
 the Jews, the other indignities and insults mentioned by
 Matthew.and Mark were heaped upon him; but he bore
.all without a murmur, praying for his persecutors,
 " Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do."

  2. QUESTION 4.—Called the place of a skull, because
the configuration of the mountain is such that from 'a
certain position and at a certain distance it resembles a
huge human skull. On their way to the place of crucifix-
ion occurred the incident recorded in Luke 22: 27-31.

  3. QUESTION 5.—They offered to Christ wine and
myrrh. It was customary among the ancient nations to
give to criminals just before death a drink which would
render them stupid, and so lessen their sufferings. This
may be what is referred to in Prov. 31:6, "Give strong
drink unto him that is ready to perish." But Jesus re.•
fused it. He would drink the full cup of his sufferings to
the very dregs.
  4. OUESTION 21. —The legs of Jesus were not broken,
that in him the paschal lamb might meet its antitype.
Ex. 12:46. The piercing of the side John records,
doubtless, to show that Jesus really died. John gives the
fact as a basis of belief. See 1 John 5: 8.

  5. QUESTION 22.—It was not the physical pain and
torture which caused the death of Jesus. It was cus-
tomary for those crucified to linger for days in agony
before death came to their relief. It was for this reason
                   LESSONS ON MARK:                      41

that, when the centurion learned of the death of Jesus,
he " marveled." Mark 15:44. Some have claimed that
the blood and water which followed the spear thrust
showed his death to be from heart disease. John 19: 31-36.
But however this may be, it is certain that Jesus gave his
life for the world; he broke Ins heart in sorrow for their
sin. " He hath poured out his soul unto death," says the
prophet (Isa. 53: 12); " My soul is exceeding sorrowful,
even unto death," says Jesus in Gethsemane (Matt.
26:38). And Jesus says again of his life: "No man
taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself." See
John to: 17, IS. It was a voluntary offering for the sins of
men.
