                   OF THE         BOOK OF LUKE.
A STUDY

                  THIRD PART.
       To be Thoughtfully and Carefully Read.


   THOSE who have been studying the book of Luke diligently for
the past six months have doubtless gained, besides a - pretty thor-
ough acquaintance with the first eleven chapters, considerable
experience in study. It will not be necessary therefore, in the
remaining lessons, to note the analysis so closely, neither will so
many notes be given to aid the student, as heretofore. A few sug-
gestions here May serve for every lesson. At the same time recall
the suggestions 'made in previous lessons. They are of a general
nature, and are adapted to all Bible study.
   1. Do not get the idea that any given analysis of a chapter is
the analysis. That which will best serve to bring the contents of
the chapter to your mind is the best for you. The essential thing
is to master the contents of a book, chapter by chapter. It is
obvious that no one can be said to be familiar with the Bible, or
with any part of it, unless he knows definitely what is in it, and
 where to find it.
   2. Think as , you read and study. The inspired direction is,
" Consider what I say,'' and the promise that follows is, " for the
 Lord shall give thee understanding in all things." 2 Tim. 2: 7,
 R. V.
   3. Do not; therefore, try to find out what somebody else thinks.
Another's thoughts may be all right, but if you take another's
 thoughts, he does the thinking, and you do not, and he gets the
benefit, while you do not. The injunction, " Consider what I
say," is to each one.
                                                    (3) •
4                      INTRODUCTORY NOTE.

   4. Remember that no man's opinion about the Bible is of any
value. Even a very good man may be mistaken; but the Spirit of
the Lord is never mistaken. It is given to teach us all things, and
to reveal to us the deep things of God. Learn to ask wisdom from
the Source,of Wisdom (see Col. 2 : 2, 3; James 1: 5, 6), and to
expect an answer. This is not saying that any one of us is inde-
pendent of .others, and can receive no help from them; but what-
ever help comes to us must be the word of God, and not human
opinions. Other people are of no help to us if they give-us their
opinions instead of the word of God.
   6. Never guess what a text means, and don't adopt somebody
else's guesses. If the meaning of any text is not obvious, medi-
tate on it, compare it with other texts, and do not be impatient in
your study. Do not expect to know everything at once.. Learn
to wait on the Lord. If in this study you make it your principal
object to get an intimate acquaintance with the facts recorded, and
the place where each event is recorded, you will gain as much as
can possibly be expected.
  6. Finally, do not argue or debate over Scripture. To do so is
fatal to an understanding of it: You cannot study the Bible in a
crowd. Study must be done alone. " Be still, a.nd know that I
am God." Ps. 46 : 10. It was not in the tempest, but in the still,
small voice that the Lord was revealed to Elijah. Noise and
clamor are incompatible with efficient Bible study. Study in silence
with the Lord. Jesus is just as able to open the Scriptures to you,
and to open your understanding, as He was when on earth in the
flesh. See Luke 24 : 32-45. Go to Him and let your faith make
Him- a real Presence near at hand, and you will find that the open-
ing of His "words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the
simple." Ps. 119: 130, R. V. " For the Lord giveth wisdom; out
of His mouth cometh knowledge and understanding." Prov. 2 : 6.

6                  LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LURE.

    16.   What did Jesus reply?
    17.   Of what did He then warn the people?
    18.   Why should we not be desirous of gain?
    19.   By what did Christ enforce this teaching?
    20.   Repeat the parable.
    21.   How should we be rich'?


                               NOTES.
  1. WITH verses 2 and 3 may be compared Eccl. 12 : 14; 1 Cor.
3: 18; 4: 5. The hypocrite hides his real character from a few,
only to have it fully exposed to the multitude in the, judgment.
  2. "YE are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.''
Col. 3 : n. '' In whose hand is the soul of every living thing,
and the breath of all mankind." Job 12 : 10. God can utterly
destroy, while man cannot, though he burn the body to ashes and
scatter them to the four winds. Therefore the righteous need
never fear what man may attempt to do.
   3. "EVEN the very hairs of your head are all numbered."
Some choose to believe that 'this is figurative, and not an actual
fact. They think so because of the seeming impossibility of the
thing; but that is measuring God by man. " The things which
are impossible with men are possible with-God." Luke 18: 27.
Compare Ps. 139 : 1-6. God even remembers every sparrow.
 With confidence then can we trust ourselves in His hands, when
we are assured that He not only knows, but that He cares for us.
1 Peter 5 : 7.
   4. WITHOUT trying to define just what constitutes blasphemy
against the Holy Ghost, it is sufficient to note one or two points.
" If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our
sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." 1 John 1 : 9.
This assures us that everyone who wants forgiveness is sure to
receive it. Therefore it is certain that no matter how grievously one
has sinned, he has not committed the sin against the Holy Ghost,
if he desires forgiveness. No repentant soul is rejected by the
Lord. "Him that cometh to Me, I will in nowise cast out."
John 6: 37. This should be sufficient to comfort the hearts of
those who tremble lest they have committed the unpardonable sin.
Thd man who has committed that sin is not troubled over it.
  5. " FOR the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what
ye ought to speak." Still more emphatic is the instruction in
Luke 21:12-16. But one who receives the Spirit's aid at such a
                 LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE.

time - must have formed an acquaintance with the Spirit before
that time. He must previously have learned to depend upon the
Spirit for guidance in speaking. The one who has never dared to
speak God's message without settling beforehand just what he
would say, will not be likely to begin in the greatest emergency of
his life. But not taking thought what one shall say, or how
he shall speak, does not mean neglect of preparation. The word
of God must be meditated upon day and night. " Meditate on
these things; give thyself wholly to them," is the instruction of
Paul to everrservant of God.

    6. ‘ THou fool." The fool is the one who says in his heart,
  " There is no God." Ps. 14 : 1. This was just what the rich man
  in the parable said. Every man whose soul is absorbed in amass-
  ing wealth for himself and Por his children, as well as the poor
  man whose anxiety day and night is how he can make a living,
  really says in his heart, " There is no God." He acts as though
  God were not in existence, and everything depended on himself.
  Life is something besides eating and drinking and having plenty
  of clothing. Life, indeed, is rest in God, and trust in His care.
  " He that bath the Son hath life; he that bath not the Son of God •
'.bath not life." 1 John 5 : 12.

         DEPENDENCE ON GOD. Luke 12 : 22-40.

   -VERSES 22-31 might be summarized by the words of,the prophet:

 " Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid."
 Isa. 12: 2. The remainder of the lesson is about the promised
 kingdom.

 tian?

  21. What are we therefore exhorted- to do?


                           - NOTES.
   1. Sucx trust as the Lord teaches in this chapter is not very
common. Many who have much to say against spiritualizing
Scripture are very loath to take this literally. It is easy to think
that we are trusting the Lord when everything is abundant ; but
real trust is shown by not becoming worried and alarmed when the
supply seems exhausted. It is impossible that a Christian should
worry about food and clothing ; for the eternal life is of more con-
sequence than mere physical life ; and he who really trusts God for
that which is greatest, can easily trust Him for that which is least.
On "growing as the lily,"'see Hosea 14: 5. See also Isa. 61 : 11.
To be full of anxious care is a sign of heathenism, but not of Chris-
tianity. See Luke 12 : 30.
   2. "IT is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. "
God delights to bestow blessings on men. " He delighteth in
mercy." Micah 7: 18. He gave Himself for us in the gift of
Christ, who " ever liveth to make intercession for us." Therefore
it is true that God lives for the purpose of bestowing the blessings
of His kingdom upon us. Let us then receive it as freely as it is
given, and thus add to the joy of the Lord.

          LESSON I11.—July 21, 1894.

PREPARING FOR HIS comm.                         Luke 12:41-59 ;
                 13: 1--5.

   IN studying this lesson, do not forget to review the whole chap-
ter until you can " think through " the whole of it. This lesson
is rather difficult of close analysis, and perhaps the heading of the
lesson may be sufficient to indicate that portion of it which is in
the twelfth chapter. Close study will enable you to master the
details. The necessity for repentance may serve to keep in mind the
subject of the first five verses of the thirteenth chapter, although it
does not indicate all the lesson that is to be learned from them.
    1. With what illustration did the last lesson close? •
    2. What question did Peter ask?
    3. How did the Lord answer him?
    4. What will be done for the faithful servant? Compare Rev.
21 : 7.
    5. What other class of servants is mentioned?
    6. How does he say, " My Lord delayeth His coming "?
    7. What is the outward evidence of what he is saying in his
 heart?
    8. What will be done to such a servant?
    9. What is said about the degrees of punishment?
   10. What did Christ say He had come to send on the earth? .
   11. What will the gospel of ,Chiist cause?
   12. How do people judge of the weather?
   13. When people can so readily read the face of the sky and of
 the earth,'what else ought they to be able to do? .
   14. With what exhortation and lesson does the chapter close?
   15. Of what did some who were present tell Jesus?
   16. What did Jesus say of them?
   17. What did He say of those upon whom the tower in Siloam
 fell?
' 18. What did He say of all who should not repent?
10              LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE.


                              NOTES.
   1. THE gospel of Christ is the "gospel of peace" (Eph. 6 : 16),
yet it causes division and strife, because of the hardness of men's
hearts. The Lord, through the Psalmist, says, " I am for peace ;
but when I speak, they are for war." Ps. 120: 7.
   2. Do NOT make the mistake of trying to make an application
of all the details of the illustration in the close of chapter twelve.
Remember that we are not told what the adversary, the officer, the
magistrate, and the judge signify, or that they are designed to have
any particular significance. Consequently, any attempt to apply
them in detail, as to God, the law, Satan, etc., can be nothing but
idle speculation. In the absence of any application of the terms
in the Scripture, it is sufficient to be admonished - by the illustra-
tion to give diligence to be at peace with God, and to be delivered
from the bondage of sin.
   3. CHRIST teaches that it is a mistake to suppose that every
calamity is a punishment for some specific sin. This is shown, not
only in the present lesson, but in John 9 : 1-3. The entire book of
Job shows the same thing. Jesus does not say that these Gal-
ileans and the others were not sinners, but that they were no
greater sinners than others who had received no injury. Read the
seventy-third psalm, and learn that God does not settle accounts
in this life ; and real also the book of Job, to learn that affliction
is not necessarily a sign of God's displeasure. See also James 6 : 11.




          LESSON IV.-Ju1y28, 1894.
       LOOSING FROM BONDAGE. Luke 13:6-30.

  Tuts lesson may be subdivided as follows : The parable of the
barren fig tree ; healing the deformed woman ; illustrations of the
kingdom of heaven, and exhortations concerning it..

   1. Relate the parable of the barren fig tree.
   2. What lesson does it teach?
   3. Who was present on one occasion as Jesus was teaching in
one of the synagogues''
                LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE.                      11

   4. What day was it?
   5. How long had the woman been afflicted?
 " 6. When Jesus saw her, what did He say and do?
   7. What was the immediate result?
   8. How did the ruler of the synagogue feel over the matter?
   9. What did he say to the woman?
  10. How did Jesus reprove him?
  11. What illustration did He use?
  12. Who did He say had bound the woman?
  13. Consequently, whose power was He breaking on the Sabbath
day? •
  14. How did these words affect the enemies of Jesus?
  1.5. What effect did the miracle and words of Jesus have on the
people?
  16. To what two things did Jesus then liken the kingdom of
heaven?
  17. What exhortation did He give?
  18. What did He say would be the case with many?
  19. What will many say and do when it is too late? -
  20. Who will be seen in the kingdom of God?
  21. What change in position will take place with ninny?

                              NOTES.
   1. WE may learn from the parable of the barren fig tree that
those who bear no fruit will be cut off. Compare John 1.5:1—h..
But we may also learn the long-suffering of Christ, and be encour-
aged. We well know that one who had taken great pains with a
tree, cultivating and dressing it carefully, without seeing any fruit,
would not cut it down the fourth year, if it bore but a little fruit.
" Every branch that beareth fruit, He purgeth it that it may bring
forth more fruit." " He which began a good work in you will
perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ.'' Phil. 1 : 6.
   2. JEsus said, " It is lawful to do well on the Sabbath days."
Matt. 12: 12. To break the power of Satan is always a good thing,
and work most appropriate for the Sabbath day. See Luke 4 : 18
for a statement of the special work of Christ. We must not fail
to note the ease with which Christ breaks the bonds of Satan. His
power is no less now than it was then ; and He is present with us
no less really than He was then. And the Sabbath day is most
appropriate for such deliverances, for it was given for the express
12               LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE.

 purpose of teaching us God's power to save. See Eze. 20 : 12 ;
 Ps. 92 : 1-4.
    3. NOTICE that Jesus did not give a direct answer to the question
 of curiosity, "A-re there few that be saved? " He told us, indeed,
 that the multitude will go the broad way, but we are not therefore
 to boast, as though we were better than they. We are not to
 indulge in speculations as to who will or will not be saved. When
 one said to Jesus, "Are there few that be saved? " He replied,
 "Strive to enter in at the strait gate," as much as to say,
 " Look out for yourself, and don't speculate about somebody else."
 When Peter was curious as to what was to become of John, Jesus
 said to him, " What is that to thee? follow thou Me." John 21 :
21, 22.
    4. " STRIVE to enter in." People misuse this text in two direc-
 tions. -Some say, "I have striven with all the power I had, and it
•is of no use, because I failed every time ; I might as well give up;
 I am too weak to do anything." Others will think that it means
 that the power is in themselves, and that they are required to do it
 all. They have made failures, but they attribute them to the fact
 that they did not strive hard enough. Jesus says, " Without Me
 ye can do nothing." John 15 : 5. This shows that there is no
 power in man. All power in heaven and earth belongs to Christ.
 Matt. 28:18. It is His Spirit that supplies the power with which
 we are to strive. See Fp)). 3 : 16.; Col. 1 : 11-13 ; Zech. 4 : 6.
 " Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it
 is God which worketh in you, both to Will and to do of His good
 pleasure." Phil. 2 : 12, 13. The apostle Paul said, " I labor,
 striving according to His working, that worketh in me mightily."
 Col. 1 : 29. Remember that, although Jacob wrestled all night,
 he gained no victory until his strength was gone, and he had to
 throw himself upon the Lord for support.




         LESSON V.—August 4, 1894.
HUrIBLED AND EXALTED. Luke 13: 31-35; 14 : 1-14.

  THE thirteenth chapter closes with the touching account of Christ's
slighted love for Jerusalem. Review the entire chapter so that you
can give the leading topics, not forgetting previous chapters. In
that part of the lesson included in the fourteenth chapter we have
the healing of the than with the dropsy, instruction concerning

self-exaltation and the exaltation that comes from humility, and
instruction as to invitations to a mast.
   1. What warning tlia some give to Jesus?
   2. Was Jesus alarmed? What did He say?
   3. Where did He say He must suffer?
   4. How did He feel towards the city that had not received Him'?
   5. Where did Jesus go one Sabbath clay?
   6. Whom did He see there?
   7. 'What question did He ask the lawyers and Pharisees?
   8. What did they have to say?
   9. What did Jesus do?
  10. What question did He put to them to show the righteousness
of what He had done?
  11. What could they say to it?
  12. What did Jesus notice in those who were invited to the din-
ner?
  13. What did He say to them?
  14. What will follow seeking a high place for one's self?
  15. How should we do when bidden to a place?
  16. Who only are really and permanently exalted?
  17. What did Jesus sayldso to the makers of feasts?
  18. Why should not the rich be invited?
  19. Who should be invited? Why?
  20. When will the recompense be given?


                             NOTES.
  1. IT would be a matter of. interest to collect all the recorded
instances of healing on the Sabbath. We should find that they are
very numerous. Some oPChrist's most remarkable cures were per-
formed on the Sabbath. What was His object in this? If we
recall what a burdensome yoke the scribes and Pharisees and law-
yers had made of the commandments and of the whole service of
God, and then remember thai the commandments of God are not
grievous, but are ordained unto life, we shall see the reason. It
was to let people know that the Sabbath should be a day of joy
and blessing.
  2. WE have the choice given us whether we will receive our
reward now or in the future. God does not bestow His rewards
14             I.B'SSONS    'rws 1300g. OF LUXE.

until the second coming of Christ (Matt- 16 : 27; Rev. 22: 12);
and therefore whatever reward we get now must consist wholly in
the empty applause of our fellowmen. But they who are content
to wait till the coining of the Lord and the resurrection, will
receive eternal riches.




      LESSON VI.—August ii, 1894.
       CALLED TO THE FEAST. Luke 14:15-35.

  Tins lesson, which includes the remainder of the fourteenth
chapter, may readily be divided, for convenience in remembering,
into two subjects: " The Parable of the Supper," and "Counting
the Cost.'' Analyze and review the entire chapter.
   1. Where was Jesus when He gave the instruction that is re-
corded in this chapter?
   2. On what day was it?
   3. What was said by one who sat at ke table with Him?
   4. What was it that led to this remail?
   5. In what manner did Jesus reply?
   6. Without committing to memory verbally, see how accurately
you can relate this parable.
   7. What did a certain man make?
   8. What did lie do at supper time?
   0. What did those who were bidden begin to do 7'
  10. What different excuses are recorded? •
  11. When the servant returned with these messages, what did
the master of the house say?
  12. When this was done, what did the servant say?
  13. What was the servant then commanded to do?
  14. As Jesus went from the Pharisee's house, who followed Him?
  15. What did He say to them?
  16. Who only can be His disciple?
  17. What examples of counting the cost did He give?
  18. What conclusion did Jesus draw from these illustrations?
                tigssors. ON THE ROOK OF LUKE.                   15

  19. What did He say of salt?
  20. What are we to learn from this? Matt. 5 : 13.

                             NOTES.
   1. THE injunction never to guess at the meaning of Scripture is
needed in connection with unexplained parables more than any-
where else; In this case the connection shows us some, at least, of
the lessons we may learn. Jesus was speaking about the resurrec-
tion at His second coming, when He Himself has said that He will
gird Himself and serve PHs own guests. Moreover, the remark
that was prompted by the reference to the resurrection, and which
in turn prompted the parable, was, " Blessed is he that shall eat
bread in the kingdom of God." Therefore we know that the
parable represents the Lord's invitation to men to eat bread in His
kingdom. Without trying to fix a location in point of time to
the various calls to supper, we may note the following obvious
lessons:—
   (a) God hath chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, as
heirs of the kingdom (James 2 : 5), not because He is partial, for
He bids "whosoever will " to come, but because the most of those .
who have great earthly possessions are content with them, and also
because whoever has wealth must become poor for the sake of
Christ. See Luke 14: 33; 2 Cor. 8 : 9.
   (b) We may learn the danger of making excuses. Those who
make excuses now will by and by find themselves without excuse;
for the fact that one makes an excuse proves that he has had a
sufficient call. Those who believe do not make excuses, and they
partake of the feast.
    (c) We may learn a lesson of comfort and hope from the urgency
of the Master of the feast. It was imperative that He have guests
to His feast. " Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter
therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in::
because of unbelief; again, He limiteth a certain 'day, saying in
 David, To-day, after so long a time; as it is said, To-day if ye will
hear His voice, harden not your hearts." Heb. 4 : 6, 7. God has
sworn by Himself that His house shall be filled. He has sent the
 invitation to everybody, but most have rejected it. But His honor
 is at stake; and His oath cannot be broken, and so the feast must
 be supplied with guests. God has more at stake than any man
 can have. And so there is none so poor and wretched but that he
 will be accepted as a guest. Such are begged and entreated to
 come. They will make as worthy guests as any, since the robe
 and all the fitness that is necessary are supplied by the Lord. It
 is He that " bath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance
 of the saints in light." Col. 1 : 12.
16              LESSONS ON THE ROOK OH' LURE.

   2. " IF any man come to Me, and hate not his father, and
mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and
his own life also, he cannot be My disciple." The same Spirit that
uttered these words also inspired the apostle Paul to write, " Hus-
bands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and
gave Himself for it " (Eph. 5: 25); and, " If any provide not for
his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied
the faith, and is worse than an infidel." 1 Tim. 5 : 8. The Spirit
does not contradict itself. Let Christ's own words, as recorded in
Matt. 10 : 37, be the comment on the meaning of the word "hate"
in the text in the lesson. " He that loveth father or mother more
than Me is not worthy of Me; and he that loveth son or daughter
more than Me is not worthy of Me." That love which leads
a soul away from Christ is to be forsaken.




       LESSON V11.---August 18, 1894.
            THE LOST FOUND. Luke 15 : 1-32.

   THERE is but one subject treated of in this chapter, and that is
indicated in the title of the lesson. But it is considered under
three heads, namely, " The Lost Sheep," " The Lost Piece of
Money," and " The Prodigal Son." These are all familiar
stories. See how minutely you can relate them.

    1. Who drew near to hear Jesus?
    2. In what words did the scribes and Pharisees murmur against
Him?
    3. What did this call forth from Jesus?
    4. Relate the first parable.
    5. How long does the man in the parable seek the lost sheep
    6. How does he feel when he finds it?
    7. What does he do when he reaches home?
    8. What lesson did Jesus teach from this?
    9. What was the second parable?
   10. What does the woman do when she has lost the piece of
silver?
                L5SSONS ON 'Mt 1300K OF LUKE.                    17

  11. What when she finds it?
  12. What lesson does Jesus teach from this? •
  13. Relate the third parable.
  14. What did the younger of the two sons receive from his
father?
  15. What did he do with it?
  16. How reduced were his circumstances?
  17. What took place then?
  18. When he came to himself, what did he say?
  19. What did he do?
  20. What took place when " he was yet a great way off"?
  21. Did his father accept him as a servant?
  22. How did he treat him?
  23. What was the general feeling over the returned son?
  24. How did the elder son feel?
  26. What was the father's reply?

                            NOTES.
  1. " THIS man receiveth sinners." That which the Pharisees
uttered as a reproach against Jesus, is His greatest glory. It is a
glory to Him, and He glories in it. He is not ashamed to receive
sinners. " He is not ashamed to call them brethren." Heb. 2 : 11.
" Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us
that we should be called the sons of God." He receives us when
we offer ourselves to Him as servants, and makes us sons. "Hence-
forth I call you not servants; . . . but I have called you
friends." John 15 : 15. " Wherefore thou art no more a servant
but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ."
Gal. 4 : 7.
   2. " THERE is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one
sinner that repenteth." If you are not very watchful, you will
find yourself reading according to the common way, .'° There is
joy among the angels over one sinner that repenteth." This is
doubtless true, but it is not what the text says. " There is joy in
the presence of the angels of God." This includes the other thought,
and adds infinitely more to it. God Himself is not ashamed to
exhibit in the presence of the angels His great joy over one repent-
ant sinner. What more could be said to encourage poor wanderers?
It is not that God will not cast off the repentant one, but that He
is overflowing with joy at his return. He cannot and does.not
attempt to conceal His great joy when even one sinner repents.
18              LESSONS ON TEE 1300K OF LUKE.

He watches for him and rushes to meet him when he is yet a long
way off.
               "For the love of God is broader
                 Than the measure of man's mind;
                And the heart of the Eternal
                 Is most wonderfully kind."
   3. IN studying the parable of the prodigal. son, do not lose the
preciousness of it by ailnwing-you-rmind-to-run- off .into -specula-
tion ac..to-who-areludinated-by---the two•sons. Whoever -you are,
the parable means you. Granted that the hard elder brother rep-
resents the position of the Pharisees toward the publicans and the
Gentiles, we must still remember that the race of Pharisees is not
yet extinct. We are either the prodigal son returning to the
Father's house, or else we are the carping elder brother. And the
worst of the second case is that we are actually in as hard circum-
stances as the prodigal, and unconscious of it. See Rev. 3 : 17.
Ltt_us be content in studying.Qiis chapter to feast upon the revc-
lation'of,the wonderful love Of God,, that we may betheinore
closely drawn, to Him. Let this word concerning Christ'Ve--ever
in our minds, This Man receiveth sinners."




     LESSON VI11.—August 25, 1894.

GIVING NO OFFENSE AND GLORIFYING GOD. Luke
                  17: 1-19.

  THE sixteenth chapter of Luke includes two parables,—the
unfaithful steward, and the rich man and Lazarus. The chapter is
not omitted from detailed consideration in this study beCause it is
unimportant, but because it is thought better not to open the way
for the speculation and controversy that would inevitably arise in
a class study of the two parables. Each one would have a theory
as to the meaning of the parables, and the time of the class would
be worse than wasted. It is evident from verses 14 and 15 that
the entire chapter is directed against covetousness. Let each one
meditate upon the parables more than he ever did before, but for-
beaiing to speculate or to indulge in any fancies as to what they

mean. In the meantime, the continuity of this study of .the book
of Luke will be unbroken if you remember that the sixteenth
chapter is devoted to the two parables.
  In the lesson before us we have a warning against causing any to
stumble; an illustration of the fact that we have nothing by which
we place God under any obligation to us ; and the account of the
healing of ten lepers, only one of whom thanked God.

   1. What did Jesus say will certainly.come?

   20. What did Jesus say about it?

                             NOTES.
  1. "OFFENSES." The Revised Version has "occasions of
stumbling." The Greek word is skandala—scandals. The idea is
not of things by which one may be personally affronted, but of sin
of any kind—things whereby one stumbles.
20               LESSONS ON THE BOOR OF LURE

   2. '• TAKE heed to yourselves." Compare Gal. 6 : 1. " If a
man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such a
one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be
tempted." The Revised Version omits the words "against thee."
" If thy brother sin, rebuke him ; and if he repent, forgive him."
This removes the personal element, which should not appear in
any case. Our duty to restore a brother is as great if the offense
be against somebody else as though it were against us, and we
are to have no more feeling over the matter because our personal
rights have been interfered with than though the offense was
against a stranger.
 • 3. IN the fourth verse we have offenses against the individual
referred 10. If a brother trespass against us seven times in a day,
and seven times turns and says, " I repent," we are to forgive him.
We cannot suppose that this limits the number of times we are to
forgive ; for he who would keep count of the number of times that
he was trespassed against, and the number of times that he had
forgiven, so as to be sure not to overstep the number, would
thereby show that there was no real spirit of forgiveness in him.
The idea is that there is to be nothing but a spirit of forgiveness
all- the time. "And be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted,
forgiving one another; even as God for Christ's sake bath forgiven
you." Eph. 4 : 32. How does God forgive?—"All things are of God,
who hath reconciled us to Himself by Jesus Christ. . .           As
though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ's stead,
bb ye reconciled to God." 2 Cm 5: 18-20. Notice that if the
brother shall say, "I repent," we are to forgive him. We are not
to inquire into his motives nor his sincerity.
    4. "AND the'apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith;"
 literally, "add to us faith." Whether the apostles really asked
 for an increase of faith, or that they might have faith, makes no
 difference; for the Saviour's answer shows that if one has faith at
.all it is sufficient. Faith cannot exist with doubt. If one has
 faith as a grain of mustard seed, he has no doubt whatever; and
 therefore he can do all things that may be done by faith. Such
 forgiveness as is here enjoined cannot be done without faith ; for
 we are to forgive as God forgives, and that • can be done only with
 His Spirit, which is ours only by faith.

   5. EPH. 6 : 5-9 shows the proper relation between masters
and servants, as also in Matt. 20 : 25-28. No one is to exhibit
a lordry disposition toward any other. All are brethren, and there
is no respect of persons with God. Therefore Luke 17: 7-9 cannot
be construed as teaching that employers need not be grateful for
services rendered by employes. Jesus took the ordinary condition
                LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE.                     21

of things as an illustration. The lesson that we are to learn is not
to expect that whatever we do we are adding anything to the Lord,
so that He is under obligation to us. Let no one think that in a
few short years he can earn an eternal reward. " The gift of God
is eternal life."




      LESSON IX.—September 1, 1894.

     CHRIST'S SECOND COMING. Luke 17:20-37.

  THE title of this lesson will be found sufficient analysis of it.
See how easily you can recall all the subjects treated of in this
chapter.
   1. What did some of the Pharisees demand of .Jesus?
   2. How did He say the kingdom of God would not come?

Compare verse 23 with Matt. 24 28.
   6. How are we to regard such sayings?
   7. What will be the manner of Christ's coming?
   8. What did He tell the people must first take place?

22                 LESSONS ON THE BOOK 0}' LUKE.


                                NOTE.
  1. " THE kingdom of God is within you." This may be ren-
dered?‘among you." But the idea which the Saviour seeks to
impress on our minds is the fact of the gradual development of the
kingdom. Those, who are waiting for it to burst upon them sud-
denly will see it too late. The kingdom of God is a condition, as
well as a place. Only those in whom the principles of the king-
dom are developed, can have any part in it when it is revealed.
God bestows upon us His glory in this present time. See John 17:
22 ; 1 Peter 5: 1. This glory is in the form of His grace. Christ's
glory when on this earth was the glory of the only-begotten Son of
God, but it was manifested in His fullness of grace and truth.
John 1 : 14. The effect of the glory in this present time is to
transform the characters of those who believe. See 2 Cor. 3 : 18 ;
4: 4-6. Thus they become fitted to dwell in the kingdom where
the glory of God shines without being veiled. Then when at last
the glory is revealed, it will not be so unnatural and foreign a
thing as to blind them, and cause their death, but will simply add
the finishing touch in the transformation, namely, to change their
bodies so that they will also shine as the sun.




          LESSON X.—September 8, 1894.
             PREVAILING PRAYER. Luke 18: 1-22.

     5.   What did he finally say to himself?
     6.   What' was it that induced him to grant her request?
     7.   What did- the Lord say?
                LESSONS ON THE ROOK OF LUKE.                      23

  20. What did He say?
  21. Who only can enter the kingdom of heaven?
  22. What did a certain ruler ask Jesus'?
  23. How did he address him?
  24. What question did Jesus first ask him in reply?
  25. Who alone is good?
  26. Did Jesus mean to imply that He Himself was not good?
See John 8 : 46 ; 1 Peter 2 : 22 ; 1 John 3 : 5.
  27. To what did Jesus then refer the young ruler?
  28. What did the young roan say for himself?
  29. What did Jesus then say to him?
  30. How did the young man receive this word? Why?


                              NOTES.
  1. Too many people make a mistake in reading the parable of
the unjust judge. They seem to think that it is an illustration of
how God deals with men, and an indication that we shall receive
notice only by long effort. We should remember that the judge
was unjust, and that God is just. There is no comparison, but
contrast, between the judge and God. God is listening to hear
before we ask. 1 Peter 3: 12. He has provided the way for us to
come to Him, and asks us to come boldly. He delights-in mercy.
Micah 7 : 18. The reason why we are to be encouraged to continue
instant in prayer, and not to faint; is that God is so kind and ready
24              LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE.

to give. " He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up
for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all
things? " Rom. 8 : 32.
  2. THE best rendering of the latter part of verse 7 is, "And
He is long-suffering with them." The idea is not that God will
finally listen to the cries of His people, although He will hold them
off for a long time, but that He will do just the opposite of the
unjust judge, because He is long-suffering with them. God will not
make His people wait long for an answer to their prayers.. " I tell
you that He will avenge them speedily." But note that this is
when His people are so much in earnest that they cry day and
night unto Him, and not only occasionally.
   3. " WHY callest thou me good? None is good, save One, that
is God." As shown by the texts referred to in the questions, and
by many others not referred to, Christ is absolutely good "There
is no unrighteousness in Him." What then did He mean by what
He said to the young man? It is evident that He could not have
meant anything else than to impress upon his mind the fact that
He Himself was God. See John 1 : 1-14. If the young man had
but recognized that, he would have had an answer to His question;
for " this is life eternal, that they might know Thee, the only true
God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent." John 17 : 3.
If the young man had kept all the commandments, what could
he lack? Are there duties that lie outside the range of the ten
commandments? " Let us hear the conclusion of the whole mat-
ter: Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is the whole
duty of man." Eccl. 12 : 13. But -the result showed that the
young man was deceived. He had not kept all the commandments.
Indeed, he had not kept any of them. He was covetous • he loved
himself better,than he did his neighbor. Thus we have the second
great principle of the law violated. But to break the second prin-
ciple means the violation of the first. " For he that loveth not his
brother whom he bath seen, cannot love God whom he hath not
seen." 1 John 4 : 20, Revised Version.•

   LESSON XI.—September 15, 1894.

       SIGHT FOR THE BLIND. Luke 18 : 23-43.

  IN this lesson we have the remainder of the story of the young
ruler, Christ's death foretold, and the healing of the blind man.
The entire chapter may easily be analyzed. Do it for yourself,
and do not be content to go on with the next lesson until you can
give a: brief outline of the contents of this chapter.

    6. How did the ruler receive this counsel?
    7. Whaycaused his sorrow?
    8. When Jesus saw his sorrow, what did He say?
    9. How difficult is it for a rich man to enter into the kingdom
of Cod?
   10. What was said by those who heard this?
   11. What did Jesus reply to that?
   12. What did Peter say?
   13. What did Jesus say that those who leave all should receivr
   14. What did Jesus then reveal to the twelve?
   15. How minutely did He foretell His sufferings and resurrec-
tion?
   16. How much of it did the disciples understand?

   18. As they came near to Jericho, whom did they find?
   19. How did the blind man learn of their approach?
   20. When he heard that Jesus of Nazareth passed by, what did
he cry?
   21. What was said to him by those who went before?
   22. What effect did this have?
26                  LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE.

     23.   What did Jesus do?
     24.   What request did the blind man make?
     25.   What did Jesus say to him?
     26.   What did Jesus say saved the blind man?
     27.   What was the immediate result?

                                NOTES.
  1. " IT is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than
fora rich man to enter into the kingdom of God." This expres-
sion implies absolute impossibility, and so it was understood by the
disciples, who said, " Who then can be saved? " Jesus said that
the thing that is impossible with men is possible with God. The
rich man who submits to the Lord will cease to be rich in this
world's goods, but will become rich in faith, and then he may
enter in. But it is as impossible for a man to enter into the king-
dom of God as a rich man, as it is for a camel to go through the
eye of a needle. The Babylonian .Jews, using the same proverb,
which was a very common one to denote impossibility, have
" elephant'' instead of "camel." Many attempts have been made
to strip the words of Christ of all force by saying that He had ref-
erence to a certain gate in Jerusalem called " the needle's eye,"
which was so small that in order for a camel to pass through he
had to' have his load stripped from him and then get down and
crawl through on his knees. This is pure fancy of the most absurd
kind. The term "needle's eye" applied to small gates is a-mod-
ern one, which has originated from the attempt to destroy the force
of this verse. There is no trace of any such name in ancient
times.
  2. IR the case of the twelve we see an instance of the effect that
preconceived opinions, without foundation, have on one's reception
of truth. So firmly fixed in the minds of the disciples was the
idea that Jesus was going to be a temporal ruler, and that His
kingdom was to be of the nature of earthly governments, that
what He told them about His death and resurrection had no effect
on their minds. It was as though He had said nothing. Yet, if
they had been diligent students of the prophecies, they might have
understood His words, and thus have been prepared for the event.
For all the prophets foretold the sufferings of Christ that should
precede the glory. 1 Peter 1 : 10, 11.
  3. THE healing of the blind man should not be passed lightly
by as an ordinary story. It was not given merely to excite our
wonder. but to cause us to trust in God. Note the readiness with
which Jesus received him and healed him. This was the mercy of
                  LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE.                          27

the Lord. Note that it was the faith of the blind than that brought
him his sight. He was poor, a beggar. He could do nothing for
himself. But he could call upon the Lord and plead His mercy.
That brought hiM sight. We are in the same plight that he was.
We are "wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and
naked." Rev. 3 : 17. If we come to the Lord Jesus as the blind
man did, we shall receive our sight as readily as he did. This
miracle was recorded for no other purpose than to show how spirit-
ual sight and riches are to be obtained.
                  "Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind; •
                     Sight, riches, healing of the mind,
                    Yea, all I need in Thee to find,
                     0 Lamb of God, I come, I come.
                  "Just I am. Thou wilt receive,
                      Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve,
                    Because Thy promise I believe;
                     0 Lamb of God, I come, I come."




   LESSON X11.—September                              22,       1894.

            A SON OF ABRAHAM. Luke 19: 1-27.

   Do NOT forget to review the chapters that have already been
passed over. Repetition and continual association are the secret of
success in- learning. Not only frequently read the entire book,
from the beginning up to the place of present study, but think as
you read, and exercise yourself in recalling the subjects contained
in any particular chapter. Here is the Bible rule for studying the
word of God: " Thou shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine
house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest
clown, and when thou risest up." This lesson is so simple in out-
line that the student will be left to analyze it for himself.
      1. As Jesus entered and passed through Jericho, who desired to
see   Him?
      2. What was this man's standing in society?
      3. What difficulty did he find in seeing Jesus?
      4. HoW did he get a view of Him?
28              LESSONS ON Tilt BOOK OF LUKE.

    5. What did Jesus do when He reached the place where Zac-
cheus was?
    6. How did Zaccheus receive the Lord?
    7. What did the people say when they saw it?
    8. What did Zaccheus say when Jesus came to his house?
    9. What assurance did Jesus give him?
  10. For what purpose did He say He had come?
  11. What did Jesus then proceed to give?
   12. Why was this parable given?
  13. Relate the parable in detail. If any hesitate in this narra-
tive, or lose the connection, let the teacher prompt them, not by
telling the thing, but by asking questions.


                             NOTES.
   1. "AND Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this
house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham." Zaccheus was
no more a lineal descendant of Abraham than were those to whom
John the Baptist and Jesus spoke when they told them that they
were not Abraham's children. See Luke 3: 8; John 8 : 33-44,
What constituted him a son of Abraham? Was it what Zaccheus
had done'? He had done nothing good. Was it because of his
promise? We have no record that even Abraham ever made any
promises to the Lord. We have only the record of the promises
of God to Abraham. The secret lies in the fact that Zaccheus
gladly received the Lord. He was a sinner, but the Lord seeks to
come in and dwell with just such people. Rev. 3 : 17-20. The
receiving of Jesus brings salvation, and makes one a child of
Abraham. " If ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and
heirs according to the promise." Gal. 3 : 29. " They which are
of faith, the same are the children of Abraham." Verse 7.
 • 2. THE parable of the pounds is an illustration of the kingdom
of God, for the Saviour gave it for the express purpose of correct-
ing some wrong ideas concerning the kingdom. From it we may
learn that Christ did not have His kingdom when He was here on
earth. He was like a nobleman who went to receive a kingdom
and to return. When He returns, it will be in His kingdom.
See Matt. 25 : 31, 34; 2 Tim. 4: 1. We are also to learn that no
one here has anything that he has not received, and therefore no
one has any right to boast over another. See 1 Cor. 4 : 7. Com-
pare Luke 19: 26 with Luke 8: 18. That which is taken away
from men at the last is not that which they have in their own right,
but that which has been lent them 10.trade with, and which they
                LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF      LUKE.                29

have not used. They only seem to have it. No injustice is done
them, for they never had anything of their own, and they refused
the capital which was provided them.




 LESSON XI11.---September 29, 1894.

TRIUMPHANT ENTRY INTO JERUSALEM. Luke 19:
                 28-48.


  Do NOT fail to notice how few subjects are embraced in this
chapter, and how easily it may be held in mind. Of course no
one will fail to note that what is done with the chapters in this
study may be done with any other portions of the Bible; and you
have doubtless been applying it in your reading and study else-
where. Of course the Epistles and some chapters of instruction in
the Gospels are more difficult of analysis than simple narrative.
Yet a little observation and close thought will enable you to recall
at will the location of many things in the Bible with which you
are familiar in a general way, but the benefit of which you have
largely lost because you could not tell where they are, or turn to
them without the aid of a concordance.

   1. Wihen Jesus had spoken the parable recorded in the preced-
ing lesson, toward what place did.He go?
   2. When He reached the Mount of Olives, what did He do?
   3. What commission did He give the two disciples?
   4. What did they do with the colt when they had brought it to
Him?
                               0
   5. What did they do as they went?
   6. What took place when they came to the brow of the moun-
tain?
    7. In what words did the multitude praise the Lord?
   8. What did some of the Pharisees say to Jesus?
    9. What did Jesus reply?
  30               LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE.

    10.   What did Jesus do when He came near the city?
    11.   What was the cause of His weeping?
    12.   What did He say would come upon Jerusalem?
    13.   How complete did He say the destruction of it would be?
    14.   Why was all this to come upon it
    15.   When Jesus came to the temple, what did He do?
    16.   What did He say to the buyers and sellers?
    17.   What did He continue doing in the temple?
    18.   What did the chief priests and others seek to do?
    19.   Why did they not effect their purpose?


                                NOTES.
    1. IT would be a good thing to take a few moments of the class
  time in an outline review of the lessons of the quarter. If the
  lessons have been well studied, it need not take more than five
  minutes to give the main topics of chapters 12-19. Perhaps some-
  one will give a complete outline of them. One pupil may be asked
  to give the subject or subjects of one chapter, and another of
  another. A good drill, also, will be to take up the chapters pro-
  miscuously, going backwards and forwards; or a certain event or
  parable may be named and the pupils asked to tell where it is found.
  But do not let this exercise, necessary as it is, draw the mind away
  from the important lesson under consideration. The student may
  give himself this test at home.
     2. " I TELL you if these should hold their peace, the stones
   would immediately cry out." Why would this be?—Because
   long before this thing had been foretold in prophecy. See Zech.
   9-: 9. God's word cannot fail. If men will not act the part
' assigned them, the very stones will do their work. God's word is
   so full of life that it can animate the stones. Compare Matt. 3 : 9.

       THE GREAT DEMAND OF THE HOUR, FROM THE PULPIT AND THE•

       That the Sabbath be more strictly observed. To assist the in-

       discusses the Sabbatic institution in every conceivable phase.

                          By ELD. J. N. ANDREWS.
         This great and exhaustive work is the result of ten years'
       hard labor and historical research. The book contains 548 12mo
       pages, and is printed in clear type, on good paper, and is well
       bound. Price, post-paid, $2.00.
