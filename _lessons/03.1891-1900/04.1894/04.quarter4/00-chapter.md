THE BOOK OF LUKE.
           FOR SENIOR CLASSES.


                 October 6 to December 29, 1894.



         LESSON 1.—October 6, 1894.
 THE PARABLE OF THE VINEYARD. Luke 20: 1-26.

  IF you have preserved the lesson pamphlets for the previous
quarters of the year, you will not now need any special instruction
in regard to study. Read again the suggestions that have been
given. Those who begin the study with this quarter, and who
have not the three preceding pamphlets, will do well to procure
them.
  This lesson is naturally divided into three portions, namely:
Christ's Answer to Those Who Demanded to Know by What
Authority He Worked; The Parable of the Vineyard; and Paying
Tribute to Ctosar.
   1. Who came upon Jesus as He taught in the temple one day?
   2. What did they say to Him?
   3. What did Jesus reply?
   4. How did they reason among themselves over His question?
   5. Why did they not dare say that John's baptism was from
heaven?
   6. Why did they not dare say it was from man?
   7. What answer did they finally give?
                                                   (3)
4               LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE.

   8. Then what did Jesus say to their questions?
   9. What did He then begin to speak to the people?
  10. See how accurately you can relate the parable.
  11. What did the husbandmen do to the servants whom the man
sent?
  12. Whom did the owner of the vineyard finally send?
  13. In sending him, what did he say?
  14. How was the son treated?
  15. What was said that the lord of the vineyard should do to the
husbandmen?
  16. What exclamation did the priests and scribes make?
  17. What did Jesus then say?
  18. What did the priests and. scribes then seek to do?
  19. Why did they do this?
  20. How did they proceed against Him?
  21. How did these spies seek to throw Jesus off His guard?
  22. What question did they then ask?
  23. Did they succeed in deceiving Jesus?
  24. What did He tell them to do?
  25. When they brought Him the penny, what did He ask them?
  26. What did they reply?
  27. What did Jesus then say to them?
  28. What was the result of this attempt to entrap Him?

                            NOTES.
  1. JESUS had not studied in the schools, and held no certificate
of authority as a teacher. Therefore the priests and scribes deter-
mined to challenge His right to teach, hoping thereby to silence
Rim. But Jesus did not lay Himself open to any retort from
them , and asked them another question, instead of replying. They
were qualified teachers. They had their diplomas, and were duly
authorized to teach the people; they were doctors of divinity.
Therefore they ought to have been able to answer immediately so
simple a matter, and one of so great importance to the people, as
the origin of the teaching and baptism of John. They dared not
bring a charge against John, because they were most anxious to
stand well with the people; and they dared not confess the truth,
                LESSONS ON THE :BOOK OF LUKE.                     5

lest they should convict themselves. So they said that they could
not tell whence John's baptism was. But if they could not answer
that question, they thereby showed that they themselves had no
right to claim to be teachers. And if they were incompetent to
teach the people, they were certainly incompetent to catechize
Jesus. Thus were they silenced. The teachers whom Jesus sends
will often find themselves questioned as closely as Jesus was; only
the wisdom which He had will enable them to answer discreetly.
He did not revile them, nor speak one disrespectful word, yet by
a simple question He forced them to convict theinselves of incom-
petency.
  2. ON the parable of the vineyard, see Ps. 80: 8-18; Isa. 5: 1-7.
See 2 Chron. 36 : 14-16 on the sending of the servants, and the
way that they were treated. The object in killing the son was to
"seize on the inheritance." Satan has laid claim to the inherit-
ance, namely, this earth. He sought to kill Jesus, so that he
might have His inheritance. To possess the inheritance of Christ
was the object of the ambition that caused Satan's fall from
heaven. The spirit of Satan in the hearts of the wicked Je?vs led
them to say, " If we let Him thus alone, all men will believe on
Him; and the Romans shall come and take away both our place
and nation." John 11 : 48. They did not know that the only way
for them to obtain the inheritance was in Christ. See Eph. 1 : 11.
  3. WHEN the priests and scribes sought to catch Jesus with flat-
tering words, they forgot that it was His Spirit that inspired these
words, "A man that flattereth his neighbor spreadeth a net for
his feet " (Prov. 29 : 5); and also the words, " Meddle not with
him that flattereth with his lips " (Pr_w. 20 : 19). The first
approach of flattery or fawning should put a man on his guard.
  4. How EASILY Jesus answered their question, without laying
Himself open to the least criticism. " Whose image and super-
scription hath it? " They said it was Caesar's. If it was CHsar's,
then it was obvious that it belonged to him. In saying that the
money had. Caesar's superscription, they answered their own ques-
tion.
   It is not necessary to do more than point out the fact that this
                 LESSONS ON TIlE BOOK OF LUKE.

makes a complete and everlasting distinction between the affairs of
civil government and those of God. The things that have Caesar's
superscription are to be rendered to him, and those that have the
stamp of God are to be rendered to Him. That does not mean
that if CHsar,—the civil power,—has committed a forgery, and
has put his superscription on that which belongs to God, we are
therefore to render it to Caesar. That would not be obeying the
Lord. It would be rendering to Cusar the things that belong to
God. Religion is from God, and therefore in matters of religion
no one is of right subject to the State. And no one can pay any
attention to what the State. may say in matters of religion, without
robbing God of His due.
   Christians, being in this world, are to be subject to the authority
of civil power. This does not say that they are to obey the laws
of the land when they conflict with the laws of God, for, in that
ease, the civil power has no rightful authority. Christians are to
pay tribute to the government, not because as Christians they seek
the protection of the State, but because, as subjects of the Prince
of Peace, they are to live peaceably with all men, as far as lies in
them. He who breaks the peace is breaking the laws of the king-
loin of heaven. But he who disregards a human law that con-
flicts with the law of God, is not thereby breaking the peace,
because the keeping of the perfect law of God is the only thing in
the world that brings perfect peace




       LESSON 11.—October 13, 1 894.

CHILDREN OF THE RESURRECTION. Luke 20: 27-47.

  THERE are three distinct topics in this lesson. Read the verses

                            NOTES.
  1. THE Sadducees rejected all the Scriptures except the writings
of Moses. Jesus showed that they did not know and accept even
his writings. If they had, they would have believed the resurrec-
tion. At one time He said, " Had ye believed Moses, ye would
have believed Me; for he wrote of Me." John 5 : 46. Moses
wrote the gospel, just as surely as did Luke and John.
  2. " Now THAT the dead are raised," or, as in Mark 12 : 26, "As
touching the dead, that they rise," " even Moses showed at the
bush." The Lord is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He
called Himself their God, many years after they were dead. That
cannot be taken to mean that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were
not really dead, for then they would not need a resurrection, and
8                 LESSONS   ON THE BOOX OP LUKE.

there would be no point in Christ's reference to it as proof of the
resurrection. But God " quickeneth the dead, and calleth those
things which be not as though they were." Rom. 4:17.
  3. " BEWARE of the scribes," etc. The reason why they were
to be avoided was because of their pride and selfishness. There-
fore it was their characteristics rather than their persons that Jesus
warned His disciples against. Consequently, we shall receive the
most benefit from the Lord's words if, instead of being on the
watch against persons with the character that He describes, we
keep on our guard against such traits in ourselves.



        LESSON I11.—October 20, 1894,
               GIVING UP ALL. Luke 21:1-24.

  Do NOT neglect thorough and frequent review. Remember that
the Spirit cannot bring to your remembrance that which you have
never had in mind.
  In this lesson we have the account of the)Widentand her two

     4. Why was it more than all the rest?
     5. What may we learn from this? 2 Cor. 8 : 12.

   23. What are the people then to do? •
   24. What will there be upon the people in those days?
   25. What will become of those upon whom the wrath rests?


                             NOTES.
    1. INSTEAD of "abundance," in verse 4, the Revised Version
has " superfluity." The same thought is expressed, but In a more
striking manner. The rich gave what they could spare without
inconvenience; the poor widow gave all she had. She, therefore,
gave more than all Df the rich men; for God does not measure gifts
as men do. Men estimate the gifts to the treasury by the number
of figures it takes to express them; God estimates them by the love
which prompts them.
  2. " TAKE heed that ye be not deceived." Christ does not
rebuke His people for wanting to know all that is possible in regard
to His coming; but He cautions them against being deceived.
Many will come In His name, professing to be Christ. How shall
we be able to detect the false prophets?—Not by written creden-
tials that they may hold, nor by indorsements from other people,
but by their words and works. Of the Good Shepherd it is said:
" The sheep hear His voice; and He calleth His own sheep by
name, and leadeth them out. . . . And the sheep follow Him;
for they know His voice. And a stranger will they not follow,
but will flee from him; for they know not the voice of strangers."
John 10: 3-5. They who know the voice of the Lord cannot be
deceived by a voice that is not His. See alsp Matt. 7 :15-23.
10                LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE.

  3. THERE have always been earthquakes and famines and wars
and pestilences. Therefore those of which the Lord speaks in
verses 10-12, before which His people are to be delivered up and
persecuted, must be the great ones immediately connected with His
coming.

   4. WHEN the people of God are brought before rulers for Christ's
sake,there is to be no argument in self-defense, but Christ is to be pre-
sented to the people. When, under such circumstances oneli seek to
defend themselves, they thereby deny Christ. Stephen and the apos-
tles are examples. They preached Christ, and did not ask favors for
themselves. The people of God are brought into such places in
order that the rulers may hear the truth. Instead of settling' in
their hearts what they shall say, they are to settle it not to medi-
tate any answer. Christ will give them utterance, and the Spirit
will speak through them. But men must have learned to trust the
Lord before that time, or they will not trust Him then. They
must have become acquainted with the voice of the Lord by faith-
fully studying His word.

  5. " SOME of you they shall cause to be put to death. And ye
shall be hated of all men for My name's sake. But there shall not
an hair of your head perish." What a striking combination this
is! They who die for the name of Christ do not perish. " For
whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever will lose
his life for My sake, the seine shall save it." Luke 9 : 24.

    6. JUST as in ancient times the people nf God were to flee When
Jerusalem was surrounded with armies, so in the very last days
when the decree goes forth that whosoever will not worship the
beast or his image shall be slain, they are to flee. They are not to
stay for anything. He that is in the field is not to return to his
house to get anything out, and he that is on the housetop is not to
come down. This means that they will previously have given up
everything. He whose heart is then still set on any earthly.pos
session, will hesitate to leave it, and will thus be destroyed.    is
not by accident that this account of the time of the end immedi,
ately follows the example of the poor widow,

      LESSON IV.—October 27, 1894.

         SIGNS OF THE END. Luke 21:25-38.

    1. WHERE did the Saviour say that there should be signs of
His coming?
    2. What did He say should be on the earth?
    3. What did He say would be the condition of men?
    4. What is the cause of the fear in men's hearts?
    5. What about the powers of the heavens?.
    6. When the powers of the heavens are shaken, what will then

    7. What should the people of God do when these things begin
to come to pass?
    8. What parable did the Saviour give?
    9. How surely may we know that the coming of the Lord is
near?
  10. Within what period of time after these things begin to come
to pass, will Christ's coming take place?
  11. What exhortation is given us?
  12. What will cause that day to come upon men unawares?
   13. How will it come upon the people who dwell on the earth?
   14. What are we to do in order that it may not come upon us in
that manner?
   15. Of what will those who watch and pray be counted worthy?
   16. How did Jesus spend His time during the week that He was
giving these instructions?
   17. How eager were the people to hear Him?


                            NOTES.
  1. “HEAR tne word of the Lord, ye that tremble at His word:
Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for My name's
sake, said, Let the Lord be glorified; but Re shall appear to your
joy, and they shall be ashamed." Isa. 66 : 5. The coming of the
Lord is a joyful event to His people. 'Therefore when they see the
12              LESSONS ON THE BOOR OF LUKE.

signs of His coming, they will rejoice. While the, hearts of men
are failing them for fear, for looking after those things that shall
come on the earth, their hearts will be filled with joy.
   2. "As A snare shall it come upon all them that dwell on the
face of the whole earth." The coming of the Lord will be at a
time when men would not naturally expect it, when the world has
no thought of it. But it will not take the people of God unawares.
See 1 Thess. 5 : 1-5. They are not dwellers on the earth, but only
sojourners. They are strangers and pilgrims. People may have
their portion as dwellers on this earth, and be ashamed at the
coining of the Lord, or they may be content to be strangers, and
rejoice in that day. •




      LESSON V.—November 3, 1894.

    8. How did they find the place where they should keep the
Passover?
    9. What kind of room was it?

  14. When that time comes, what will Jesus do? Luke 12: 37.
  15. After the Passover supper, what did Jesus do?
  16. What did He say of the bread which He gave to them?
  17. What did He next take?
  18. What did He say of the cup?
  19. What do the bread and the wine signify? 1 Cor. 10 : 16.
  20. By taking of them, what do we show? 1 Cor. 11 : 26.
  21. What is said of those who shall eat and drink' in this ordi-
nance unworthily? Verse 27.
  22. How does one eat and drink unworthily? Verse 29.
  23. What should a man do yin order that he may not so eat?
Verse 28.
  24. For what is he to examine himself? 2 Con 13: 5.


                            NOTES.
  1. FROM verse 7 we learn that Jesus and His disciples ate the
Passover at the regular time. On the fourteenth day of the month
the lamb was to be slain, and was to be eaten that evening. Jesus
sent the disciples to prepare the Passover on the first day of
unleavened bread, which was the fourteenth, when the lamb must
be killed. See Ex. 12 : 6,18. If He had departed from the regular
custom, the disciples would not have accepted the change without
question.
  2. IN this connection we may note a point in regard to the kind
of bread and wine to be used in the Lord's Supper. The common
argument against fermented wine is that it may awaken a desire
for drink on the part of some; but this is not by any means the
principal reason why it should not be used. The wine represents
the blood of Jesus, who "was without blemish, and without spot.
Wine that has undergone fermentation would be no fit emblem of
the blood of Jesus. It would be like offering a blemished lamb in
the ancient time. Moreover, it was the feast of unleavened bread,
and no leaven was to be found in any house. See Ex. 12:15.
Therefore there could have been no leavened bread in the house at •
that time. The same text also shows that there could have been
nothing but unleavened bread with which to celebrate the Lord's
14              LESSONS ON THE BOOK OS' LUKE.

Supper. Leaven indicates decay, and that would not represent .
the spotless Lamb of God. Christ Himself was the Passover.
1 Cor. 5 : 7. The Lord said, " Thou shalt not offer the blood of My
sacrifice with leavened bread." Ex. 23: 18. To some this may
seem an unimportant matter; but the Lord thought it of enough
importance to require an express command.
   3. WHEREVER in the Bible we find in our translation the word
" testament,''' we should read " covenant." Christ said, " This
cup is the new covenant in My blood." His blood is " the blood
of ,the everlasting covenant." Heb. 13 : 20. He is the surety of
the new covenant. We enter into covenant relation with Him by
accepting His blood as the sacrifice for our sins. Thus we make a
covenant with Him by sacrifice. Ps. 50: 5. He makes the sacri-
fice; we have only to accept it. And we eat and drink the Lord's
Supper worthily when we discern the Lord's body, and, by faith,
take Him into our hearts, just as really as we take the bread and
wine into our mouths. As the bread and the wine go to nourish
our bodies, and give us physical life, so the body and blood of
Christ, taken by faith, will give us spiritual life.



     LESSON Vt.—November 10, 1894.
      WHO IS THE GREATEST? Luke 22:21-38.

  THIS lesson consists of a conversation between Jesus and His
disciples on the evening of His betrayal, in the room where the
Passover was celebrated. It might be divided as follows: Christ
Announcing His Betrayal, Strife among the Disciples, and Peter's
Vain Self-confidence.
   1. Who did Jesus say was with Him at the table?
   2. Was it necessary that Jesus should suffer? See verse 22
and Acts 2 : 23; 17 : 3.
   3.. What was said of the man by whom He should be betrayed?
   4. What did the disciples begin to inquire among themselves?
               LESSONS ON THE. BOOK. OF LUKE.•                15
   5. What took place among them?
 • 6. What did Jesus say about lordship?
   7. How did He say it should be among His disciples?
   8. Who is the chief among God's children?
   9. How was Christ among His brethren?
  19. Ins,what did He say- Ilis disciples had been with Him?
  14. What'did He appoint unto them?
  12. What would they have in His kingdom?
  13. What did the Lord say unto Simon Peter?
  14. For what had the Lord prayed?
  15. What did He say that Peter should do when he was con-
verted?
  16. What declaration did Peter make?
  17. What did the Lord say that Peter would surely do?
  18. What question did He then ask the disciples?
  19. What did they reply?
  20. But what did He say they should now do?
  21: What did He say must yet be accomplished concerning Min?


                            NOTES.
   1. IT was necessary that. Christ should suffer for man; for
" without the shedding of blood there is no remission." But it
was not necessary that any man should betray Him. " God. so
loved the world, that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whoso-
ever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting
life..":. This gift was made in the beginning, and not simply when
Christ hung on the cross. The plan of salvation was ample:
enough to embrace every man born into the world. It was not
necessary that a few men should be left out, in order that Christ
should be betrayed and murdered. Even with all the hatred that
men manifested to Him, they did not take His life. He laid down
His own life. No man could take it from Him. John 10: 18.
Christ could. have laid down His own life as a sacrifice for man,
every soul had loved and obeyed Him. So, although it was deter-,
mined that Christ should suffer and die, and it was foretold that
men should betray Him and crucify Him, they did it of their own
free will.
16           _ LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE.

   2. IN the church of Christ, there is to be no lordship. That is
left for the world. It is true that the apostate church modeled
itself after the fashion of the world, and worldly methods have
been brought into the church. But that is not according to Christ.
He came as a servant. Matt. 20 : 25-28; Phil. 2 : 7. The greatest
in the kingdom of God will be Christ, and He is the One that will
have performed the most and the lowest service. Exaltation is
found only in serving.



     LESSON V11.—November 17, 1894.
      BETRAYED AND DENIED. Luke 22: 39-62.

  THIS portion of the story of the last night of our Saviour before

  30. How did this affect Peter?


                              NOTES.
   1. " WHEREFORE, seeing we also are compassed about with so
great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the
sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the
race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher
of our faith; who for the joy that was set before Him endured the
cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the
throne of God. For consider Him that endured such contradiction
of sinners against Himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your
minds. Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin."
Heb. 12: 1-4. Christ did resist unto blood, striving against sin.
" His sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the
ground." There was the temptation for Him to refuse to go on
with the work assigned Him. No man can ever realize the
strength of the temptation that beset Christ in the garden. If He
had failed then, Satan would have triumphed as surely as he would
 if he had overcome Christ in the wilderness. Christ endured the
cross, despising the shame, and we may also expect to pass through
severe suffering, but it will be with Him. An angel strengthened
 Him, and we have the assurance, " God is faithful, who will not

suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but Will With the
temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be . able to
bear it." 1 Cor. 10 : 13. " Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered
for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind; for
he that hath suffered in the flesh bath ceased from sin." 1 Peter
4 : 1.
  2. "AND the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter.         . . And
Peter went out, and wept bitterly." There is power in a looklof
the Saviour. There was no condemnation in that look, but love And
pity. It melted the heart of Peter to repentance. People often
use the words, " Thou God seest me," as a means of frightening
children into obedience. They are taught to think that it is a ter-
rible thing for the Lord to see them. Not so would the Lord have
us regard His looks. There is salvation in His look. The Lord
says: " To this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a
contrite spirit, and trembleth at My word." Isa. 66 : 2. " Turn
us again, 0 Lord God of hosts, cause Thy face to shine; and we
shall be saved." Ps. 80 : 19.

     LESSON IX.—December 1, 1894.
      CONDEMNING THE JUST. Luke 23: 13-31.

  THIS portion of the book needs the most careful study, as the
things related are of infinite importance. It is not vague, dreamy
meditation that does us good. We are to meditate upon the suffer-
ings of Christ for us; but this means more than that we are to
think in a general way that He was betrayed and condemned and
crucified. We should read and reread the story of His betrayal,
His suffering in the garden, the reproaches that were heaped upon
Him, His crucifixion and resurrection, until every event becomes
a living reality to us, and we can see Him set forth evidently cru-
cified among us. Then as, tracing the narrative through in our
meditation, we see what it all meant, we may be able to say, " I
20               LESSONS OS THE. BOOK OF LUKE.

am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ
liveth in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by
the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for
me." Gal. 2 : 20. Nothing can give this vivid conception except
the very words of the Scripture; therefore study them above all
things. Review, REVIEW, REVIEW. " Give thyself wholly to
them."

                              NOTE.
  L THREE times Pilate bore witness to the innocence of Jesus,
but as soon as he began to parley with the people, he lost all influ-
ence with them. When he gave sentence, it was that it should
be as they required." He simply delivered up Jesus to a mob,
in order to save himself. If he had utterly refused to deliver
Jesus to their will, he would, no doubt, have been accused to the

emperor, and have been deposed, which was what actually took
place, after all. Every man is to some extent in the same position
that Pilate was. " What shall I do then with Jesus, which is
called Christ?" is a question which comes to everyone. Selfish
interest clamors that He be given up. If He be kept, loss of posi-
tion, of business, or of friends, may be the result. And so too
often Christ is delivered up, and in doing so, in order to save their
life, they lose it, for He is the only one who can bestow life.
There is no one who is in a position to condemn either Peter or
Pilate. Our fear and selfishness have often caused us to deny Jesus,
or to pursue a vacillating course that ended in defeat. And yet
He abides faithful.

                              NOTE.
   1. ONE malefactor said in derision, "If thou be Christ, save
Thyself and us." He had no confidence in Christ's claims. In
common with all the people, he had a vague expectation that Mes-
siah would come, but he, like the others, looked for a mighty
warrior, who should deliver them from merely temporal ills.
What the malefactor asked was impossible. Christ could not save
Himself and them. He could save men only by the sacrifice of
Himself. " With His stripes we are healed." The words of the
malefactor that first spoke showed that he had no conception of the
character and work of Christ. But into the mind and heart of the
other one, the light of faith had dawned. He saw in Christ the
Deliverer from sin and death. His request was, " Lord, remember
me when thou contest into thy kingdom." This prayer was
answered. Christ promised that the thief should be with Him in
Paradise. When He comes in His kingdom, an event still future,
the thief will be remembered. He could not be with Christ before,
for npne can be taken to be with Him until He comes the second
time, to take them to Himself. See John 14 : 1-3. The circum-
stances under which the promise was made necessarily called forth
an emphatic declaration, " Verily, I say unto thee to-day."
Christ could not save Himself from the cross, but, hanging on the
cross, with all men reviling Him, and even the heavens seemingly
against Him, He could speak salvation to the believing sinner.

                              NOTE.
   IN this lesson there is the clearest evidence as to the day of
the Sabbath, and also to the fact that there has never been any
change made in it. It is the evidence of the Holy Spirit, who
inspired the writing of the record years after the events took place.
Let us note a few points:—
   (a) The day on which Jesus was crucified was the preparation
day. Ex. 16 : 22, 23 tells us what day was the preparation for
the Sabbath. It was the sixth day of the week.
   (b) The women went at once and bought the spices and oint-
ments, and then they "rested the Sabbath day according to the
commandment."
   (c) It was the first day of the week when they came to the sep-
 ulcher to anoint Jesus. They came very early in the morning, yet
 "the Sabbath was past." Mark 16: 1. Therefore, since the Sab-
 bath was the very day before they came to the sepulcher, and they
 came to the sepulcher on the first day of the week, and there . are
 only seven days in a week, it is very plain that "the Sabbath day
24               LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE.

according to the commandment" is the seventh day of the week.
So that, although the fourth commandment does not use the word
"week" when it says that "the seventh day is the Sabbath," the
Scripture plainly tells us that it is not an indefinite seventh part of
time that is meant, but the definite seventh day of the week.
   (d) We do not count anything on the example of the disciples.
Human example is not what we are to follow. We are not to keep
the Sabbath because they did, but for the same reason that they
did, namely, because the commandment of God requires it. More-
over, it makes not the slightest difference that Jesus had not yet
risen from the dead when the disciples rested on the seventh day of
the week. It is the Holy Spirit that records the fact, and He calls
the seventh day of the week "the Sabbath day according to the
commandment." Whatever men may say of the Old Testament,
there is no disagreement about the fact that the New Testament
was written for Christians, and that the language of the New Tes-
tament is the language for Christians. Therefore the seventh day
of the week is the Sabbath for Christians, and the first day of the
week is an ordinary working day.

   24. What did the eleven say to them as they entered?
   25. What did the two then relate?
   26. Was their story believed by the eleven? Mark 16 : 12, 13.

                           NOTES.
  1. Jesus will not force His presence upon anybody. He made
as if He would have gone further, and so He would if the two
had not asked Him to come in. He is willing to come in and sup
with everyone, but waits for an invitation. "Behold, I stand at
the door, and knock; if any man hear My voice, and open the
door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with
Me."
   2. "AND they said one to another, Did not our heart burn
within us, while He talked with us by the way, and while He
opened to us the Scriptures?" In this we find out what is meant,
by expounding the Scriptures. Jesus expounded to them in all
the Scriptures the things concerning Himself; and this was simply
opening the Scriptures to them, and letting the truth that is hi
 them shine forth. "The opening of Thy words giveth light."
 Ps. 119: 130, Revised Version.
   3. "DID not our hearts burn within us, while He talked with us
 by the way?" The same experience may be had to-day. Jesus
26              LESSONS og THE BooK.         LUKE.

says, "Lo, I am with you alway." His presence is as real as
when He walked with.the two disciples to Emmaus. His Spirit
will open the Scriptures to His people now as well as then ; and
any disciple, however humble, may have that presence, and may
have his heart made to glow as he is taught by the Master.
   4. THE two disciples went back to Jerusalem the same hour, al-
though it was late. They could not keep the good news to them-
selves. • They found the eleven gathered together, discussing what
Peter and the others had told them. Some make the mistake Of
reading verses 23 and 24 as though it was the two disciples that
said, "The Lord is risen indeed, and bath appeared unto Simon;"
but it will at once appear that this was not so, when we consider
that the two did not know that Peter had seen Jesus. All they
knew about was "the vision of angels" which the women had seen.
Besides, if they had known of what Peter had seen, that would
not likely • have been the first thing on their lips. They were
full of the revelation that had been made to them, and the first
thing they told was that which they had come all the way from
Emmaus to tell. The difficulty has arisen over the fact that Mark
says that the eleven did not believe the story of the two. But
their .minds were in a whirl of excitement. They had accepted
Peter's story, but now when these two come and tell them how
they had seen Jesus at Emmaus, they were ready to disbelieve
everything. They did not yet understand the scriptures which set
forth that Christ must needs have suffered, and then to enter into
glory.



     LESSON XI11.—December                       29, 1[894.

           THE ASCENSION. Luke 24 : 36-53.

  WE come now to the last lesson of the year, and to the close of
the book of Luke. There is only one thing to say, and that is,
Read, read; review, review. Pursue the same plan in all your study
of the Bible. Do not let it degenerate into a mere intellectual.ex-
ercise; this the study of the Bible should never be, and yet it will
                LESSONS ON TIM BOOK Os LUKE.                     27

be found that there is nothing so healthful and strengthening to
the intellect as the proper study of the Bible. The greatest bene-
fits from this study of Luke are yet to come. They will come in
the shape of a greater facility in acquiring a knowledge of any
other portion of Scripture, but especially in the light and instruc-
tion that will dawn upon your minds as you think upon the things
which you have outlined during the past study. You will find
that the more thoroughly you have studied the lessons, the more
you are now able to learn from the same scripture that you have
been studying. Many precious truths have doubtless been im-
pressed upon your minds as you have been studying; but the one
thing that is the most valuable of all, if you have learned it, is
the knowledge of the fact that the light and truth come from the
very words of the Scripture. If you have learned to inquire of
the Scriptures themselves, and to let them speak to you, and teach
you, you have learned the secret of the knowledge of God.

believing, what did He ask for?
   8. What did He then proceed to do?
   9. What did He then say to them?
  10. What did He do for them?
  11. What did He show them was necessary?
  12. What must be preached in His name?
  13. How extensively must these things be preached?
 -H. What did He then promise them?
  15. For what were they to wait?
  16. What were they then to do? Verse 48; Acts 1 : 8.
  17. To what place did He afterward lead them out?
  18. What did He there do to them?
  19. What took place while He was blessing them?
  20. With what feelings did they return to Jerusalem?
28              LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE.


                             NOTE.
   "Aral they worshiped Him, and returned to Jerusalem with
great joy."- This may seem strange when we remember how sor-
rowful they were when they heard of His going away, until we
read the record in the first chapter of Acts : "And while they
looked steadfastly toward heaven as He went up, behold, two men
stood by them in white apparel ; which also said, Ye men of Gali-
lee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which
is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as
ye have seen Him go into heaven." This was the cause of their
joy as they returned to Jerusalem. The same promise is made to
every one of us, and should cause the same joy in our hearts. It
will surely do so if, like them, we have walked and talked with
Jesus, and have had our hearts burn within us at His gracious
words. "Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now
ye see Him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable
and full of glory; receiving the end of your faith, even the salva-
tion of your souls." 1 Peter 1 : 8, 9. And so, as we read His
words, "Surely I come quickly," which are so much nearer fulfill-
ment now than when first spoken, we shall respond, with the dis-
ciple whom Jesus loved, and who loved Him, "Even so, come,
Lord Jesus."
