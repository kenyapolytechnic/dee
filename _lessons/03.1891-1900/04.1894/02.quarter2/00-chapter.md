A STUDY OF THE BOOK OF LUKE
                       Seeond Part.

   TO BE THOUGHTFULLY AND CAREFULLY READ.




  A .Lrnouon with this quarter you have a new lesson pamphlet, do
not neglect the old one. Read again the introduction to the lessons,
and keep in mind the suggestions as to study that are found in nearly
every lesson. Remember, however, that the lesson is in the Bible,
and not in the pamphlet. Do not neglect the study of preceding
chapters, as you advance. Make it a practice to give a synopsis of
the chapters already studied, as often as once a day. As you dO this,
by yourself, let your mind call up as complete a picture as possible of
each topic as it is mentally pronounced. In order that your know]-
edge of the details may be increasing, so that a mention of any given
subject in the chapters that have been studied may present a complete
picture to your mind, read the chapters carefully, at least once a week,
noting, while doing so, the analysis. This will not be so great a task,
in addition to the study of the advance lesson, as may at first be
thought, and the results will more than pay for the time thus spent.
You will find that, while indelibly fixing and increasing the knowl-
edge that you already have, such a drill will enable you to learn the
new lesson more easily. The faithful student will notice a marked
difference in the time necessary to enable him to grasp the contents of
a chapter now and when he began the book. This difference will be
more and more marked as the study progresses. Do not allow your-
self to become impatient at spending so much time on one portion of
scripture. It is much more profitable to devote your time to one
portion of Scripture, and have it for your own, than to reed ten times
as much in the same time and know but little about it when you are
through. This study need not exclude your general reading of the
Bible. It should not ; and you will find that, the more faithfully
you pursue this study, the more good will you derive from your other
reading.

                 April 7 to June 30, 1894,

                               •

         LESSON XIV.-April 7, 1894•
        THE LIFE-GIVING WORD. Luke 7:1-17.

  Tuts lesson is easily analyzed. It consists of but two subjects, heal-
ing the centurion's servant (verses 1-10), and raising the son of the
widow of Nain (verses 11-17).
    1. When Christ had ended His discourse, where did He go?
    2. Who was lying there at the point of death?
    3. How was this servant regarded by the centurion?
    4. What did the centurion desire of Jesus?
    5. Whom did he send to Jesus with the message?
    6. What did the Jews say of the centurion?
    7. Why did they think he was worthy to be favored?
    8. What additional message came to Jesus as He was on His way
to the centurion's house?
    9. What did the centurion say of himself?
  10. What only did he say Jesus needed to do in order to heal the
servant?
  11. How did he illustrate his idea of the power of Christ's word?
  12. When Jesus heard these things, what did He say to those with
him?

6                 LESSONS ON THE BOOK Or LUKE.

18. What was the result of the centurion's faith? Matt. 8 : 13 ;
Luke 7 : 10.
14. Where did Jesus go the next day?
15. What did He meet at the gate of the city?
16. How Ntiras Jesus affected by the sight of the mother's grief?
17. What did He say to her?
18. What did He then do and say?
19. What wonderful result followed?
20. How did this affect the multitude?
21. What did they say?
22. How extensively was this published?

                               NOTES.
  1. LET no one be disturbed over the difference in the accounts that
Matthew and Luke give of the requests that Jesus should heal the
centurion's servant. While there is a difference in the two accounts,
there is no disagreement. Luke does not mention the centurion's
meeting with Jesus, but his silence does not contradict Matthew's
statement that the centurion did meet Jesus. Both accounts must be
joined, in order to get all the particulars. But do not let anxiety to
" harmonize " the two records draw the mind away from the impor-
tant lessons to be learned from the story.
   2. THE Jews said to Jesus, concerning the centurion, " He is worthy
that thou shouldest do this for him ; for he loveth our nation, and him-
self built us our synagogue (Revised Version). They thought that
this would make Jesus more ready to grant the request. The idea
that God thinks more of men who are able to do much for the church
than He does for others is not yet extinct.;•It is this that leads min-
isters sometimes to think more of the conversion of a rich man than
of a poor man. It is this wrong idea of God's estimate of worthiness,
that keeps many people from receiving the help that God wants to
give. They say, " I am so unworthy," meaning that they are- not
good enough to receive anything. " I can see how God can save
such an one. but I can't have any hope for myself." Their only
thought is that God expects men to do something for Him before He
will do anything for them. When people come to think that they
are accepted by the Lord on that basis, they form the criticising
portion of the church. They are al ways looking at other professed Chris-
tians, to see if the others have really come up to the standard of good-
ness that God can apeept, namely, the standard to which they them-
selves have arrived The centurion himself did not consider that his
liberality gave hilt •any special claim on the attention of the Lord.
Said he, " I am not worthy that Thou shouldest come under my roof."
But he was not like so many in these days who confess their own
                  LESSONS   ON   TNE BOOK OF LUXE.                    7

unworthiness; and who, therefore, will not claim anything from the
Lord. He said, " Say in a word, and my servant shall be healed."
He expected blessings in spite of his unworthiness, and such are the
ones who receive mercies from God. Jesus Himself was not influenced
by the representations of the Jews ; but when the centurion, while
pleading his own unworthiness, showed how easily Christ could grant
his request, the Lord said, " I have not found so great faith, no, not
in Israel." "And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; as
thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee." Matt. 8 :13. It was
his simple faith, and not his rich gifts, that recommended the cen-
turion to Jesus.
   3. " BUT say in a word, and my servant shall be healed. For I
also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I
say unto one, Go, and he goeth ; and to another, Come, and he
cometh ; and, to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it." Jesus re-
garded this as the most marvelous manifestation of faith that He had
ever seen. Wherein lay the greatness of the faith 7—In the simple
fact of grasping the power of Christ's word. Just as the centurion's
word could set men in motion, and thus accomplish results, so Christ's
word could command the disease to depart. The Psalmist, speaking
of God's dealing with ancient Israel, said, " He sent His word, and
healed them, and delivered them from their destructions." Ps. 107 :
20. This was fullfilled in the case of the centurion's servant. Jesus
sent His word, and the life that was in it made the sick man well. It
is such faith as the centurion manifested, and only such,—faith that
lays hold of and rests upon the power of the living word,—that will
give us the kingdom. See Matt. 8 : 10-12.
   4. " Now when He came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there
 was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was
a widow; and much people of the city was with her. And when the
 Lord saw her, He had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep
 not."/" Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth
 them that fear Him." Ps. 103: 13. " In all their affliction He was
 afflicted, and the angel of His presence saved them." Isa. 63 : 9.
 " For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the
 feeling of our infirmities." Heb. 4 :15. In the compassion of Jesus
 for the bereaved and sorrowing mother, we see the tender pity of God
 for suffering and sinful men ; for " God was in Christ, reconciling the
 world unto Himself." 2 Cor. 6 :19. Satan has led men to think that
 God is stern, exacting, and tyrannical. Christ " emptied Himself "
 (Phil. 2 : 7, Revised Version), that He might represent only the Father,
 and so disprove Satan's slander. " God is love." Who can hesitate
 to come to Him, when we know that it was His love and compassion
 that was manifested in the gentle Saviour 7/
    6. "AND He said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. And he that
 was dead sat up, and began to speak." What was it that put life
8                 LESSONS ON THE 1300E Or LUKE.

into the young man?—Just the word of Christ, which is spirit and
life. John 6 : 63. It was the same word that will raise the dead at
the last day. It was the same word that gives life to the sinner.
"And you hath He quickened [made alive), who were dead in tres-
passes and sins." Eph. 2: 1. Conversion is resurrection. See Rom.
6 :1-6 ; Col. 2 : 12, 13 ; 3 : 1. The same word produces it that will
raise the dead at last. Therefore the apostle longed only to know
Christ and the power of His resurrection (Phil. 3 : 10), and he prayed
that God would give to us who believe, to know the exceeding great-
ness of God's power, even the working of His mighty power which He
wrought in Christ when He raised Him from the dead. Eph. 1 : 19,
20. This miracle of raising the widow's son was wrought that we
might believe that Jesus is the Christ, and that, believing, we might
have life through His name. John 20 : 31. Our belief in the Lord
Jesus, and in the miracles which the Bible says that He did, is meas-
ured by our acceptance of the life which He came'to giv, and which
is in His word.


           LESSON XV.-April 14, 1894.
    CHRIST'S PROOF OF HIS MINISTRY. Luke 7:18-35.

   REREAD the introduction to the last lesson and do not neglect its
instructions. The gems of Scripture do not ail lie on the surface, but
can be found only by digging. See Prov. 2 :1-5. It is a mistake to
suppose that such searching of the Scriptures, and finding of rich
treasures, can be accomplished only by those who have great educa-
tional advantages. Remembei that the things of God are hidden
from the wise and prudent, and are revealed unto babes. Matt. 11 : 25.
The deep things of God are revealed to the most unlearned person
who comes to the word with simple reverence, and who meditates in
it. The Spirit of God makes known " the deep things of God "
Cor. 2 : 9, 10), and it is given to all who believe (John 7 : 39). It is
not by brilliancy, but by continually dwelling upon a passage, that
one learns much from it. You cannot exhaust the Scriptures. The
longer you search, and the deeper you dig, the richer will be the
treasure. So do not count it a vain thing to spend much time upon a
small portion of the Bible.
   This lesson is all devoted to John the Baptist; first, his message to
Jesus; second, the answer that Jesus returned; third, the testimony
of Jesus concerning John; fourth, the inconsistency of the people
concerning them both.
    1. What was done to John the Baptist soon after the baptism of
Jesus? Luke 3 :19, 20.
                  LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE.                        9

    2. When he heard, in the prison, of the wonderful works of Jesus,
what message did he send?
    3. When the disciples of John delivered their message, what did
Jesus do?
    4. What did He then say?
    6. When the messengers had departed, what question did Jesus
ask?
    6. What was implied by the first question?
    7. What second question did He ask?
   8. What was the form of the question the third time?
   9. What testimony did Jesus give as to John's standing as a
prophet?
  10. Whom did the Lord say that John was?
  11. What is it said that the publicans did?
  12. What course did the Pharisees and lawyers pursue?
  13. To what did the Lord then liken the men of that generation?
  14. How did they exhibit their petulance and inconsistency?
  15. How did they regard John because of his rigid abstinence?
  16. What did they say of Christ because He mingled with the
people?
  17. What did Jesus say of wisdom?

                             NOTES.
  1. " To the poor the gospel is preached." Let every poor, afflicted
soul remember this. Poverty, either of purse or of intellect, is no bar
to the favor of God. He was made in all things like His brethren.
" For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though He
was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that ye through His pov-
erty might be rich." 2 Cor. 8: 9. As a poor man He mingled with
poor men, those whose poverty would not admit of their being learned
in the wisdom of this world, adapting His teaching to their compre-
hension. The gospel is simple, suited to the comprehension of a
child. This does not exclude the rich and learned; for what the weak
and feeble can comprehend may easily be understood by the great, it'
they are only willing to receive it. The truth of God is revealed to
faith, and not to intellect. They who trust only to their own reason-
ing faculties cannot perceive the things of God. Not that reason is
to be ignored, but faith is to be its guide and instructor. " For the
Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom; but we preach
Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumbling block, and unto the
Greeks foolishness; but unto them which are called, both Jews and
Greeks,Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God." See 1 Cor.
1 : 22-9.
   2. "AND all the people that heard Him, an:: tue prtulicans, justified
God." God declares that His words and ways are right; but, tried by
10                 LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE.

that standard; every man is sure to be wrong. Every man, therefore,
who either directly or indirectly justifies his own course, thereby con-
demns God's way. But every man who acknowledges his guilt,
thereby declares that God is right. This is what is done in confession
of sin. God says that we are sinners, and He points out to us the par-
ticular sins. Confession of sin is the simple acknowledgment that
God is just in declaring us to be sinners, by the standard of His own
life. And when we thus justify God, He justifies us, for '‘ if we con-
fess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to
cleanse us from all unrighteousness." 1 John 1: 9.
   3. FAULT-FINDING iS a necessary accompaniment of unbelief. It
is useless to try to remove objections from the mind of a man in whom
is the spirit of unbelief. Though you answer one objection to his sat-
isfaction, you have accomplished nothing, for the same process must
be repeated on every point, and objections will rise faster than they
can be met. Each individual objection must be met; and though
ninety-nine out of a hundred were satisfactorily explained, the ob-
jector would be no nearer the truth than at the first. Neither would
he be if the hundredth one were explained. The reason is that those
objections have been explained satisfactorily to his reason; he can
plainly see that there was no reason in them. But the spirit of un-
belief is still in him, ready to raise a hundred other objections equally
inconsistent with reason. If, however, that spirit of unbelief is once
destroyed, those objections will not arise to require explanation. The
Pharisees and others were full of the spirit of unbelief, and so, although
they refused to receive John's teaching, on the ground that his ab-
stemious habits indicated that he possessed a devil, they as promptly
repudiated Jesus just because He did not follow John's practice but
ate as other people did. Those who are so cautious that they cannot
receive the truth, unless it is in harmony with their captious intellect,
are the very ones who eagerly devour the most flagrant falsehoods.
See 2 Thess. 2 : 9-12.


          LESSON XVI.-April 21, 1894.
              SAVED BY FAITH. Luke 7:36-50.

  THIS lesson contains only one subject,—the anointing of Jesus by
the sinful woman, in the house of Simon the Pharisee, and her for-
giveness. Study the story well, until you are familiar with every de-
tail. Then you can feed upon the comfort that there is in it. An
analysis of this entire chapter may very readily be made, sufficient to
bring it before the mind. Thus : Healing of the centurion's servant;
raising the son of the widow of Nain; inquiries of John the Baptist;
                   LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE.                    11

extolling him and upbraiding the Pharisees; forgiving the repentant
woman in the house of Simon.
   1.   With whom did Jesus one day go to eat?
   2.   While He was there, who came?
   3.   What was her character?
   4.   What did she bring with her?
   5.   What did she do?
   6.   When the Pharisee saw this, what did he say to himself?
   7.   What did Jesus, knowing his thoughts, say to him?
   8.   What illustration did He use to give Simon a lesson?
   9.   What was the Pharisee's decision in the case?
  10.   How did Jesus then apply the lesson?
  11.   How much love had the Pharisee shown to Jesus?
  12.   Show the contrast between him and the woman.
  13.   What did Jesus say of her sins?
  14.   In what condition did Simon's lack of love show him to be?
  15.   What did Jesus say directly to the woman?
  16.   When He said this, what did those at the table begin to say?
  17.   How did Jesus then address.the woman?
  18.   How was she saved?


                               NOTES.
  1. " Tills man, if He were a prophet, would have known who and
what manner of woman this is that toucheth Him; for she is a sinner.' '
So spake the Pharisee within himself. He didn't know the Lord,
and there are many to-day who are just as little acquainted with Him.
Christ came to save sinners. " This is a faithful saying, and worthy
of all acceptation, that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sin-
ners." 1 Tim. 1 : 15. That which the Pharisee thought would be
the reason why Jesus would not receive the woman, was the very rea-
son why He did.
  2. THE woman knew the Lord better than the Pharisee did. His
frowns could not deter her from coming to Jesus. Whenever a sin-
ner seeks to come to Jesus, the devil undertakes to keep him away.
He says to the sinner, " You are too vile to approach so pure a being;
you are not fit to associate with him." And then he quotes Scripture
to the sinner. He says that the Lord is " of purer eyes tha7n to behold
evil " (Hab. : 13), and evil shall not dwell with Him (Ps. 5 : 4, 5).
Too often the sinner is frightened away, but if he is as wise as the
poor, sinful woman in this lesson, he will only press the closer, say-
ing, " Since evil cannot dwell with the Lord, I will abide with?Tim,
and thus my sin will be driven away."
12                LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE.

   3. " To whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little." The Phar-
isee bad not shown common courtesy, much less love, to Jesus. His
heart had not been touched by the love of God, and „be had not
received forgiveness. This was not because of God's unwillingness to
forgive, but because of his self-righteousness. A man will love in
proportion to what he has been forgiven; but if he is so self-righteous
that he feels little need of forgiveness, of course he will not be moved
to love. Therefore the ones who love the Lord the most are the ones
who have the greatest sense of their own sinfulness.
   4. " THY faith bath saved thee; go in peace." Whatever gospel
truth we find expressed in the writings of the apostles, we shall find
illustrated in the ministry of Christ. The apostle Paul wrote, " There-
fore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our
Lord Jesus Christ." Rom. 5: 1. In this lesson we have a practical
illustration of that statement. Many who are longing for peace fail
to find it, because they seek for it in the wrong way. They are look-
ing for peace as an evidence that they are accepted with God,
whereas peace comes as the result 2f knowing one's acceptance with
God. " Being justified, . . . we have peace." But right here
many still err. They think that peace is merely a state of feeling,
and so they look for a certain indescribable feeling of peace, and if
they do not have it, they are in darkness and despondency. Those
who depend on this feeling will have a fitful experience, and run the
risk of fatal deception. All should understand that peace is not feel-
ing, but an actual fact. It is reality, end not imagination or senti-
ment. Peace does not depend on feel ng, and there may be, and
often is, absolute peace with God and no feeling whatever. If this
were not so, then a knowledge of acceptance with God would be only
a matter of feeling after all. For if a certain feeling must always
accompany peace, then one would have only to consult his feelings to
know whether or not he is justified, since peace always accompanies
justification. One's feelings are from himself, but peace with God
comes from God. One can understand his own feelings, even though
he cannot describe them; but the peace of God " passeth all under-
standing." Phil. 4: 7. It is God who speaks peace to His people.
Ps. 85 : 8. God is " the God of peace " (Heb. 13: 20), and Christ is
the " Prince of peace" (Isa. 9 : 6.) " He is our peace." Eph. 2 : 14.
Christ is a real being, and not a mere feeling; and we have peace with
God only by having Christ, who dwells in our hearts by faith. Eph.
3 : 17. So peace, like righteousness, is ours only by faith. And this
is so because it is not simply a consequence that fblloys the receiving
of righteousness, but it accompanies righteousness, as a part of it.
" Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have
kissed each other." Ps. 85:10. " The work of righteousness shall be
peace." Isa. 32: 17. Righteousness is the character of the God of
peace and the Prince of peace. We get righteousness by getting the
                  LESSONS ON THE toolt Or LURE.                      18

life and character of God in Christ. But we get peace in the same
way, since peace is as much the life of God as is righteousness. So we
get righteousness and peace by taking Christ for all that He is. His
peace was unruffled by all the tribulations which He endured; He is
used to such things, and therefore will not leave us when tribulations
come. To everyone He says, " These things I have spoken unto you,
that in Me ye might have peace„ • In the world ye shall have tribula-
tion; but be of good cheer ; I have overcome the world." John 16:33.




        LESSON XV11.-April 28, 1 894.
           SOWING AND REAPING. Luke 8: 1-21.

   THE principal feature of this lesson is the parable of the sower, and
its interpretation. Following it we have an impressive lesson as to
how we should use the light which God gives us; and then in the
three verses that close the lesson we are told who are the real brethren
of the Lord. After a careful study of the verses indicated, the words
" Parable of the Sower " will suffice to bring all the details of this
portion of the chapter vividly before our minds.
   1. What did Jesus do as He went through all the cities and vil-
lages?
   2. Who accompanied Him?
   3. How did Jesus instruct the people who flocked to Him out of
every city?
   4. What was the subject of the parable given in this lesson?
   5. What became of the seed sown by the wayside?
   6. On what kind of ground did some of the seed fall? Compare
verse 6 and Matt. 13: 5.
   7. What became of that seed?
   8. Among what did other seed fall?
   9. What was the result?
  10. What resulted from the seed that fell on good ground?
  11. What was the reason that Jesus spoke in parables? Compare
verses 9, 10 with Matt. 13 : 10-17.
  12. In explaining the parable, what did Jesus call the seed?
  13. What did He say of that which fell by the wayside?
  14. Who are represented by the seed that fell on stony ground?
  16. What is indicated by the seed falling among thorns?
  16. What is said of the seed on the good ground?
14                 LESSONS ON THE HOOK or LUKE.

  17. What do men do with a candle when they light it?
   18. What is the object of lighting a candle?
   19. What will be done with all bidden things?
   20. What exhortation did the Saviour give in regard to hearing?
   21. What will be done with the one who uses what is given him?
   22. What to him who does not use the light from heaven?
   23. Who came to Jesus while He'was teaching?
   24. What hindered their approach?
   25. When told that His mother and brethren desired to see Him,
what did Jesus say?
   23. Relate in their order the details of the parable given in this
lesson.


                                NOTES.
   1. "THE seed, is the word of God." "Being born again, not of
corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liv-
eth and abideth forever." 1 Peter 1: 23. The word of God not only
loss life, but it is life. John 6 : 63. It is " the word of life." Phil.
2 : 16. When the apostles had been put into prison, the angel of the
Lord set them at liberty, and said, " Go stand and speak in the tem-
ple to the people all the words of this life." Acts 5 : 20. Not only
is it life, but its life is indestructible and incorruptible; the words of
the Lord are " the words of eternal life." John 6 : 68. So when it
germinates in the heart, it brings forth fruit unto eternal life, and
makes the man like itself.
   2. A GOOD example of wayside hearers is given in Eze. 33 : 30-32:
"And as for thee, son of man, the children of thy people talk of thee
by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another,
everyone to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is
the word that cometh forth from the Lord. 11.nd they come unto thee
as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as My people, and they
hear thy words, but do them not; for with their mouth they show much
love, but their heart goeth after their gain. And, lo, thou art unto
them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice, and can
play- well on an instrument; for they hear thy words, but they do
them not." Revised Version.
   3. " FOR the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon
it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, re-
ceiveth blessing from God ; but that which beareth thorns and briers
is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned."
ileb. 6 : 7, 8. Hard, stony ground does not drink in the rain, and so
does not bring forth fruit. The rain which God sends is His righteous-
ness. See Isa. 45: 8; Hosea 10: 12. The growth of plants is many
times taken as a likeness of the growth of Christians. " For as the
                  LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE.                         15

earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that
are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord will cause righteousness and
praise to spring forth before all the nations." Isa. 61 : 11. God is light
(1 John 1 : 5); He is a sun (Ps. 84 : 11); He is the dew (Hosea 14 : 5).
He supplies all the conditions for the growth of His people, who are
" trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that He might be
glorified." Isa. 61 : 3. If, like the good soil, they drink in the heav-
enly light and moisture, they will bring forth much fruit.
   4. " TINT° you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
God ; but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and
hearing they might not understand." Is God, then, a respecter of
persons? Does He give favors to some that He withholds from others?
—Not by any means. "For there is no respect of persons with God."
Rom. 2 : 11. " The Lord is good to all; and His tender mercies are
over all His works." Ps. 145: 9. Since with Him there is " no varia-
bleness, neither shadow of turning " (James 1 : 17), it follows that He is
equally good to all. How is it, then, that to some is given to know the
mysteries of the kingdom of God, and not to others? The Bible an-
swers this question. " The secret of the Lord is with them that fear
Him ; and He will show them His covenant." Ps. 25: 14. " Good
and upright is the Lord ; therefore will He teach sinners in the way.
The meek will He guide in judgment; and the meek will He teach His
way." Ps. 25 : 8, 9. That is, all who are willing to understand may
understand. The truths of God are hidden only from those who are
too proud or self-conceited to learn. At another time Jesus said, " I
thank Thee, 0 Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that Thou hast hid
these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto
babes." Luke 10: 21. But a thing that is easy enough to be under-
stood by babes is surely within the grasp of those of mature age. It
is hidden simply because the righteousness of God is revealed to faith,
and not to acuteness of intellect. Whoso receiveth the kingdom of
heaven, must receive it as a little child.
  6. " HE that hath ears to hear, let him hear." This shows that all
may hear and understand if they will. But with this exhortation
must be coupled the warning, " Take heed therefore how ye hear; for
whosoever bath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from
him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have." The mar-
ginal rendering and the Revised Version have it " that which he
thinketh that he hath." " Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifi-
eth [buildeth up]. And if any man think that he knoweth anything,
he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know." 1 Cor. 8 : 1, 2. He
who hears in faith and love, with an open heart, will increase in
knowledge, and will ever go on increasing in wisdom. But he who is
puffed up with the idea that he knows at least some things perfectly,
will learn nothing, and eventually even that which he thinks he has
16                 LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE.

will be taken from him, and he will stand before the world with all
his emptiness revealed. No matter how much a man knows, if he
thinks that he knows anything perfectly,—if he thinks, for instance,
that on certain texts of Scripture there is no more to be learned,—the
result will be that erelong he will lose even the little understanding
of them that he already has.



         LESSON XV111.—May 5, 1894.
              SPEAKING PEACE. Luke 8:22-40.

   VERSES 22-25 give the account of the stilling of the tempest. The
remainder of the lesson (verses 26-40) tells about the expulsion of the
legion of devils from the Gadarene, the destruction of the swine into
which the demons entered, and the effect which the whole affair had
on the people. The entire lesson may be summarized thus: Stilling
the tempest; freeing the demoniac. Connecting the preceding lesson
with this one, we may have a mental picture of the first forty verses
of this chapter, under these heads: Parable of the sower; stilling the
tempest; healing the demoniac. Be sure, however, that you do not
get this outline by simply memorizing the synopsis here given. Get
it direct from the Bible, by reading the verses so carefully and so often
that the subjects stand out in bold relief.
  1. What came to pass on a certain day?
  2. Where did Jesus propose that they should go?
  3. What did Jesus do as they sailed?
  4. While He slept, what took place?
  5. What was their condition? Compare Matt. 8 : 25 ; Mark 4 : 37.
  6. What did the disciples do and say?
  7. What did Jesus immediately do?
  8. What was the result?
  9. Having stilled the sea, what did Jesus say to the disciples?
10. How did this miracle affect them?
11. In what country did they land?
12. Who met them as they landed?
13. What did the demoniac say to Jesus?
14. What had Jesus said to the unclean spirit?
15. How had the devils treated the man?
16. How many of them had possession of him?
17. What request did they make to Jesus?
 IS, Into what did Jesus suffer them to enter?
                      LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LURE.                         17

      19. What then happened to the swine?
'     20. What effect did this have on the keepers and on the people of
    that country?
      21. When the people saw the man that had been possessed of devils,
    clothed and in his right hind, what did they request Jesus to do?
      22. Did Jesus comply with their request?
      23. What did the man who had been healed desire of Jesus?
      24. What did Jesus tell him to do instead?
      25. How faithfully did he fulfill this commission?
      26. How was Jesus received on His return?


                                    NOTES.
       1. MARK gives us the words that Jesus used in stilling the tempest:
    "And He arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace,
    be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm." Mark
    3 : 39. This is one of the miracles that is recorded that we may be-
    lieve that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing, we
    might have life through His name. John 20 : 31. A few texts will
    indicate the lesson that we may learn from it. " The wicked are like
    the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and
    dirt." Isa. 57 : 20. " I will hear what God the Lord will speak; for
    He will speak peace unto His people, and to His saints; but let them
    not turn again to folly." Ps. 85 : 8. " For He is our peace," and He
    came preaching peace. Eph. 2 : 14, 17. " Therefore being justified by
    faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." Rom.
    5 : 1. Just as the word of Christ quieted the sea, so His word to us, if we
    receive it as His word, will give peace to the soul.     Great peace have
    they which love Thy law; and nothing shall offend them," or cause
    them to stumble. Ps. 119: 165. " 0 that thou hadst hearkened to
    My commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy
    righteousness as the waves of the sea." Isa. 48 : 18. So when God
    speaks peace to us, it is by speaking righteousness; and we have that
    righteousness if we hear His word with meekness. " Incline your ear,
    and come unto Me; hear, and your soul shall live." Isa. 55: 3.
       2. THE account in Mark, like the one in Luke, mentions only one
    man possessed with devils; but in Matthew it is stated that there were
    two men. All that it is necessary to bear in mind in order to see that
    there is no contradiction, is that neither Mark nor Luke says that there
    was only one man. One of them was doubtless more prominent than
     the other, and special attention is directed to him by Mark and Luke,
     who give more of the details than Matthew does.
       3, Ix this lesson we have an example of Christ's triumph over a
     legion of devils. Satan, the chief of the devils, is Apollyon, the
     Destroyer. Rev. 9 : 11. Christ is " the Prince of peace," Isa, 9 : 6,
18                LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE.

The devils, true to their nature, were tormenting the poor man,—driv-
ing him to and fro like the waves of the sea by the winds. Christ,
true to His nature, spoke peace, and the troubled soul had rest.
What a perfect parallel this miracle was to that which preceded it
Let this word ever be the joy of the tempttd one, " Christ is more
powerful than Satan; He has spoiled principalities and powers."
" These things I have spoken unto you, that in Me ye might have
peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer;
I have overcome the world." John 16 : 33.
  4. ALL the blessings that Christ had come to bestow upon the Gad-
arenes, and of which they had such ample and striking evidence,
were nothing to them compared with the loss of their swine. Of
course their trouble was on account of the loss of the money value of
the hogs, so that their case is precisely that of thousands who choose
this present world instead of Christ. Bunyan has aptly illustrated
this by the man intent on selecting from the garbage with a muck
rake, and oblivious of the crown of glory above his head. We may
well pray, " Deliver us from the muck rake."
  6. THE man out of whom the devils were cast wanted to be with
Jesus. That was a most natural desire; but Jesus said to him, " Re-
turn to thine own house, and show how great things God hath done
unto thee." God saves men for service. " Ye are an elect race, a
royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession,
that ye may show forth the excellencies of Him who called you out
of darkness into His marvelous light." 1 Peter 2 : 9, Revised Version.
But, although the Lord sends us out to service, instead of allowing us
now to dwell in His personal presence, beholding His face, He does not
leave us alone, for He says, " Lo, I am with you aiway." Matt.
28 : 20.
  6. NOTE also that, although the people refused to have Jesus with
them, He did not utterly forsake them. They would not have Him
among them, so He left a representative. " Ye are My witnesses, saith
the Lord." Isa. 43 :10. "And now I am no more in the world, but
these are in the world." "And the glory which Thou gayest me I
have given them; that they may be one, even as We are one: I in
them, and Thou in Me, that they may be made perfect in one; and
that the world may know that Thou hast sent Me, and hast loved
them, as Thou hast loved Me." John 17 : 11, 22, 23.

           LESSON XIX.--flay i2, 1894.

       SAVED BY HIS LIFE. Luke 8 : 4 1-56; 9: 1-6.

  SINCE in this lesson we finish the eighth chapter, make a special re-
view of the subjects of the two preceding lessons. When you have
mastered this lesson, you should be able to give a synopsis of the
entire chapter. The present lesson is easily outlined, thus: Raising
the ruler's daughter; restoring the woman with the issue of blood;
sending out the twelve.
                              QUESTIONS.
    1. What ruler came to meet Jesus after His return from Gadara?
    2. What did he desire?
    3. How old was his daughter? and what was her condition?
    4. As Jesus went, what hindered His progress?
    5. Tell the circumstances of the woman who came behind Jesus as
He went along.
    6. What did she do? and what was the result?
    7. What did Jesus immediately ask?
    8. How did the apostles express their surprise at such a question?
    9. How was Jesus able to distinguish the poor woman's touch from
all others?
  10. When the woman saw that Jesus knew about her, what did she
do?
  11. What comforting assurance did she receive?
  12. While this was taking place, what message came from the
ruler's house?
  13. What did Jesus say to encourage the father?
   14. Who only did Jesus allow to enter the house with Him?
   15. What did He say to those who were bewailing?
   16. How did they receive this statement?
   17. Describe the raising of the maiden?
   18. After these things whom did Jesus send to preach?
   19. What power and authority did He give them?
   20. What were they to do as they preached the gospel?
   21. What charge were they given concerning provision for their
journey?
   22. When they entered a house, what were they to do?
   23. What were they to do when they were not received?
   24. When they departed, what did they do?
20                 LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LIME.

                                  NOTES.
   1. " LET us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith."
 Heb. 10 : 22. The crowd thronged Jesus, yet the poor, afflicted
 woman, who could only get near enough to touch the hem of His gar-
 ment, was really nearer to Him than anybody else in the whole com-
 pany. It is faith that brings the soul near to God.
   2. "SOMEBODY hath touched Me; for I perceive that virtue is gone
 out of Me." Instead of "virtue," the Revised Version has " power,"
 which is more forcible, and a more exact rendering. Christ is not
 only the wisdom of God, but He is the power of God. 1 Cor. 1 : 24.
 Faith lays hold on that power and appropriates it.
   3. MANY people think that faith is nothing but imagination. If
 that were all, why didn't it avail to heal the woman when she was be-
ing treated by the physicians? She showed her confidence in their
skill by spending all her living upon them. Imagination, if properly
acted upon, will cure an imaginary disease; but imagination cannot
give back life that is actually departing, as it was from that woman.
 Moreover, Christ Himself perceived that something had gone from
Him. It was not imagination that healed the woman; it was faith,
and " faith is the substance of things hoped for."
   4/WHAT was it that went from Christ to the afflicted woman?—It
was just the thing that she stood in need of, and that was life. " The
blood is the life," and that was what she was losing. As soon as she
touched Jesus, " immediately her issue of blood stanched." She was
made whole. Life from Jesus had followed that touch of faith, and
filled her. This also was written " that ye might believe that Jesus
is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life
through His name." John 20 : 31. Christ " is our life." Col. 3 : 4.
He came to give life, not simply physical life, but spiritual life. This
life is as real as the life He imparted to the woman, and is obtained in
the same way./ " I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet
not I, but Christ liveth in me ; and the life which I now live in the
flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave
Himself for me." Gal. 2 : 20. In this lesson we have a practical
example of the reality of the work of faith.
   5. CHRIST is the "firstborn from the dead." Col. 1 : 18. And yet
many were raised from the dead before His crucifixion and resurrec-
tion. Nevertheless, it is true that there is no resurrection of the dead
except through the resurrection of Christ. 1 Cor. 15 : 17, 18. He is
" the Lamb slain from the fbundation of the world." Rev. 13 :8.
Then He must also be the Lamb raised from the dead from the foun-
dation of the world. That this is the case He Himself showed in the
words, " I am the resurrection and the life." John 11: 25. So in all
things He has the preeminence. There is no life but from Him.
                  LESSONS ON THE BOOK OP LUKE.                        21

   6. Ix this lesson we have illustrated the pitying tenderness of Jesus.
Let us not forget that in all this He was representing God to men. It
was God's life and character that He was living. From this we see
that God " delighteth in mercy." Micah 7 :18. It is He that is
" touched with the feeling of our infirmities.". He does not like to
see sorrow and suffering, and so He gives His own perfect, life for their
removal. Who cannot fully trust that such a God will give him the
very best things that the universe contains?
   7. " HE called His twelve disciples together, and gave them power
and authority over all devils." This power was not given to the
twelve alone, but to the seventy as well. Luke 10 : 17. Neither did
it cease with them, for He promised it even to the end of the world.
Matt. 28: 18-20. And yet people mourn over the great power of
Satan, and often make it an excuse for their failures. What matters
it how strong Satan may be, or how numerous a host he may lead,
since Christ has given His followers power over all devils? Mark, it
is not simply power over one devil, but "over all devils." All the
devils combined are not a match for the weakest soul who through
faith is armed with the life of Christ. He has "spoiled principalities
and powers." In chapter eight we saw what power Christ had over
a legion of devils. To man He has given the power so to resist Satan
that he will flee in dismay, but only as man continues " steadfast in
the faith."




          LESSON XX.—May 19, 1894.

            THE BREAD OF LIFE. Luke 9:7-27.

   Tam lesson may be sufficiently outlined as follows: Herod's per-
plexity; the return of the twelve; the feeding of the five thousand;
opinions concerning Jesus; instruction to His followers. Again the
caution must be repeated to the student not to study the synopsis
from the lesson pamphlet, but directly from the Bible. In every les-
son use the pamphlet at first only for the purpose of noting the por-
tion of Scripture forming the lesson. Then read the verses very care-
fully several times, and make your own synopsis. Note down on a
slip of paper the different topics, and then compare with the list in the
pamphlet. Bear in mind that the Bible, and not the pamphlet, is to
be studied. The pamphlet is designed only to direct your study, so
that you may study to the best advantage.

                              NOTES.
   1. "AND he received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of
God, and healed them that had need of healing." There is one thing
that always recommends one to the kind attention of Jesus, and that
is to be in need. And yet that feeling of need and general worthless-
ness is what keeps many away from Him. There were no exceptions,
no special favorites. No matter who they were, nor how many there
were, He healed them that had need of healing. Thus it came to pass
that " there were whole villages where there were no sick ones, for He
had healed them all." He is the same to-day that he was then.
What he did then He is just as able and willing to do now.
                      "All the fitness He requireth
                       Is to feel your need of Him."
                                                       •
  2. FIVE thousand men were fed with five loaves and two fishes,
and not only did they all eat, but they were all filled. Imagine how
much it would take to fill to satisfaction a crowd of five thousand
hungry men, besides women and children. And then think of the
small portion available for them. There was not enough for each one
                  LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE.                         23

to have a mouthful. If they had divided it equally among them-
selves, there would have been scarcely enough for anyone to have
even the taste of food. And then, most wonderful to relate, there was
much more left, after all had been satisfied, than there was when they
began to eat. W hat more striking illustration could be given of the
statement that He " is able to do exceeding abundantly, above all that
we ask or think? Eph. 3 : 20.
  3. THE question is, Where did that bread come from? The origi-
nal amount, instead of being diminished, was increased. There can
be only one answer : It came from the Lord Jesus Christ Himself.
He is the Bread of Life. John 6 : 48-51. In this miracle we are
again shown how that believing on Him we may have life through His
name. For just as He had power in Himself to supply the physical
needs of that multitude, so He has power to supply all our spiritual
wants. And just as surely as the multitude could eat that bread
which came from Him, and be nourished by it, so we may really feed
upon Christ, and grow thereby.
  4. IT seems incredible that anyone who really believes this miracle
should ever have a doubt of Christ's power to save us by His own life
in us. The general objection is that it seems so unreal, so intangible,
that we cannot understand how Christ's life can come into us to make
us strong to do His will. Well, here we have the thing made as sim-
ple as the supply of daily bread for our physical strength. Let us go
to the very beginning of the matter. There is nobody who has any
doubt that the food which we eat day by day gives us strength. We
become faint and ready to die through long fasting; we eat good food,
and our strength and life come again. That food becomes part of our
blood, and the strength and the life which•we feel renewed in us are
the strength and the life that were in the food that we ate. And yet,
as we look at the bread, we can see no life in it, and it does not look at
at all like flesh and blood. If we had not been used to receiving
strength all our lives through eating food,—if we had been miracu-
lously kept alive till manhood without food,—and at the age of
twenty-one were told that our life in the future depended on our eat-
ing bread, the majority of people would starve to death. Very few
would believe that any life could come from such a source. Scientists
would be ready to demonstrate the impossibility of forming flesh and
blood out of bread. It is a merciful provision of Gil for the preser-
vation of the race that people learn to sustain life by eating, long
before they are able to reason about it. When the plant is growing,
we see evidences of life in it, although we cannot see the life. We
see immense energy displayed by it. We see huge clods of earth
 pushed aside by it, and even stones are sometimes rent asunder by it.
 Whence come this life and power?—Through God's word, which
said, " Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding sped, and the
24                LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE.

fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon
the earth." Gen. 1: 11. The energy displayed in the growing plant
is nothing less than the power of God. That same life is stored up in
the seed, which forms the food of man; so that our physical food
comes as truly from the Lord as did the bread which the five thousand
ate. In that case the process of bread making was shortened. Now
just as God fills the plant with life, of which we partake for the nour-
ishment of our bodies, so He fills us with His own life of righteousness,
if by faith we receive Him through His word. We cannot understand
how any of it is done; but it is no more difficult to believe that God
can work perfection in a man than that He can do it in a plant.
   5. THE people could not feed themselves; they could not derive any
strength from themselves. They, as we and all others are, were en-
tirely dependent for strength on the food which they ate. Moreover,
they could not do anything to assist the food to give them strength.
AU that y could do was to eat it as it was provided for them, and •
then leave .t alone. Why can we not learn the lesson which God de-
signs us tc learn from our daily food? Whether we realize it or not,
we deper 1 absolutely on Christ for our life, through the food which
He prov' les us. So we must depend solely on Christ for our right-
eousness which is real life. If our faith grasps the reality of this
miracle,—a miracle that is repeated every day,—then it can grasp the
fact that He can put His life directly into us; and having that, we
have all. His life fills and satisfies the hungry soul.
   6. THE gospel is God's plan, and not man's. Man's only plan for
receiving anything is to seize upon it. " Each one for himself," is
the motto of the world. But Christ says that whosoever wishes to
live must give up his life, and that whoever seeks to save his own life,
shall lose it. The world's motto is derived from Satan. He had a
glorious position. But he wanted more, and set about to seize it, and
as a consequence he lost everything. Christ had everything, but He
willingly gave up all. He did not grasp and hold even His own, and
as a result He gained everything. Read Phil. 2:5-9. " For ye know
the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though He was rich, yet for
your sakes He became poor, that ye through His poverty might be
rich." 2 Cor. 8 : 9.

          LESSON XXI.—May 26, 1894.
 POWER AND GLORY OF 1115 COMING. Luke 9 : 28-50.

   THE last verse of the last lesson is properly the first of this, for the
transfiguration was the fulfillment of the promise that some then
present should not taste death till they had seen the Son of man come
with power. Do not neglect to reread the preceding lesson while
studying this. A careful reading of the verses composing this lesson
will show the following topics : The transfiguration; casting an unclean
spirit out of a child; announcement of Christ's approaching death; a
lesson of humility; exclusiveness forbidden. The most prominent
things in the lesson are the transfiguration, and the healing of the child.
The other things are no less important; but if the lesson is carefully
studied as a whole, these most striking features will serve to recall the
others to the mind.

fore their death?
    2. What did He do about eight days afterward?

26                LEgiiONS ON THE BOOR OP LUKE.

                              NOTES.
  1. THAT the transfiguration was a miniature representation of the
second corning of Christ, is evident from the words of Peter : " For we
have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known
unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were
eyewitnesses of His majesty. For He received from God the Father
honor and glory, when there came such a voice to Him from the ex-
cellent glory, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with
Him in the holy mount." 2 Peter 1 :16-18.
   2. WHEN Christ comes, it will be with the glory of the Father.
Matt. 16 : 27. See also verse 26 of the chapter we are studying. When
He comes, there will be two classes of the righteous,—those who have
died, and are raised to life immortal, and those who are alive, and
who are changed to immortality, and taken to heaven without tasting
death. See 1 Thess. 4 :14-17. These two classes were represented at
the transfiguration. " Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the
land of Moab, according to the word of the Lord. And He buried
him in a valley in the land of Moab." Deut. 34 : 5,6. The only
way by which a man once dead can ever appear among the living is
by a resurrection. Jude, in showing the meekness of Christ, inciden-
tally refers to the resurrection of Moses: " Yet Michael the Arch-
angel, when contending with the devil He disputed about the body of
Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said,
The Lord rebuke thee." Jude 9. The devil has the power of death,
through sin (Heb. 2 : 14), and so he claimed Moses as his lawful prey.
Christ claimed him by right of redemptitn , yet would not rail at the
devil. By virtue of His superior power He delivered Moses from the
grave, and so they were together in the holy mount. Elijah had
been taken to heaven in a whirlwind,—translated to heaven without
seeing death. These two representatives of the vast host of the re-
deemed at the last day, were with Christ when He appeared in the
glory with which He will be clothed at His second advent.
   3. " THIS is My beloved Son ; hear Him." Does this absolve men
 from the duty of hearing and obeying God the Father? Hear Him:
 " I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like
 unto thee, and will put My words in His mouth; and He shall speak
 unto them all that I shall command Him." Deut. 18 :18. Hear Him:
 " Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not Mine, but His
 that sent Me." John 7 :16. " For I have not spoken of Myself ; but
 the Father which sent Me, He gave Me a commandment, what I
should say, and. what I should speak." John 12 : 49. " The words
 that I speak unto you I speak not of Myself; but the Father that
 dwelleth in Me, He doeth the works." John 14:10. "As My Father
 hath taught Me, I speak these things." John 8 : 28. Hear Him:
                  LESSONS ON THE NOON OE       uncle:                27

"Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or theprophets; I am
riot come to destroy, but to fulfill." Matt. 5 : 17. "And it is easier
for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail."
Luke 16: 17. "Not everyone that saith unto Me, Lord, Lord, shall
enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of My
Father which is in heaven." Matt. 7 : 21. Christ is the only mani-
festation of God to man. The law of God is the righteousness of God.
Isa. 51 : 6, 7 ; Rom. 3 : 21, 22. It is God's way. Ps. 119: 1, 2. There-
fore the life of God is the law of the universe. But Christ is God.
In Him is life, even the life of God. In the life of Christ we see the
law of God in action. So the law of God is found by men only in the
life of Christ. He is the one mediator between God and man, to
bring man to God. Therefore we are commanded to hear Him. For
the Father " hath committed all judgment unto the Son; that all
men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father." John
5 : 22, 23.



          LESSON XX11.—June                      2,     1894.
    THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST. Luke 9 :51-62 ; 10:1-16.

   THERE are more distinct topics in this lesson than in some of the
others, but persistent and thoughtful reading of it will make them all
take their proper places in the mind. We find, first, the rejection of
Jesus by the Samaritans, and the desire of James and John to call fire
down upon them, which met with a rebuke from Jesus; then we have
the words of Jesus to three who would follow Him, showing that they
must not expect ease and abundance in His service, and that every-
thing else must hold a secondary place. In the portion of the lesson
found in the tenth chapter we have the sending out of the seventy,
and the instruction given therewith. If the portion of Scripture has
been thoroughly studied, all the details may be brought to mind by
something like this: Rejected by the Samaritans; conditions of follow-
ing Jesus; sending out the seventy.
   Do not forget to review not only the whole of the ninth chapter, but
the, seventh and eighth as well. Read frequently from the beginning
of the book, and occasionally take a mental review of all the chapters
from the beginning, without the Bible in hand. This may be done
 while walking to or from work, while riding on a train, while the
hands are employed in some mechanical work that does not require
special thought, or in a waking hour of the night; and it will be
 found a pleasure instead of a task.

                                 NOTES.
    1. THE lesson given to us by the Saviour, through the rebuke to
 James and John, is very simple, yet how slow we are to learn it. If
 it had always been heeded by those who professed to be the followers
 of Christ, there would never have been any Inquisition •' no martyrs
 would ever have been burned at the stake, in the name of Christianity.
 People sometimes think that the evil of religious persecution lies in
 the fact that men who are in error persecute those who hold the truth.
 This is true only because those who hold the truth never persecute.
 In the case before us Christ was openly rejected. Surely if ever pun-
 ishment should be administered on religious grounds, it was then ;
 but Christ would not suffer it. It is as impossible for a true follower
 of Christ to persecute others in any way whatever for religious opinions
 as it would be for Christ to do so ; and He said : " I am come a light
 into the world, that whosoever believeth on Me should not abide in
,darkness. And if any man hear My words, and believe not, I judge
 him not; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world."
 John 12: 46, 47.

     2. " YE know not what manner of spirit ye are of. For the Son
of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them'." Per-
secution, therefore, is not from the Spirit of Christ. The spirit that •
would inflict punishment on men because they do not believe as we
do, or even because they openly reject Christ, is the spirit of anti-
christ. Christ's whole work is to save men, and not to destroy them.
James and John did not know what spirit they were of; they were
deceived. They thought it was zeal for Christ that prompted them
to wish to call down fire upon the Samaritans ; but it was a false,
selfish zeal. It was personal pique, rather than zeal for the Master ;
for love to Christ shows itself in Christlike ways. In every persecu-
tion on account of religion it will be found that pride and. selfish big-
otry are at the bottom of it. The persecutors feel personally affronted
 because others do not agree with them. They feel as if they were
 being defied, and they call their hateful spirit zeal for the cause of
 God.
     3. "AND they went to another village." Christ has not only given
 us precept, but He has left us an example of how we should deal with
 those who sin against light. When He was rejected, He went to an-
 other place. How much trouble and dishonor to the cause of Christ
 would have been avoided if His professed followers had learned to let
 people alone when they chose their own way instead of Christ's!
 Take His words to them faithfully, " ye that are spiritual." Again
 and again, with the meekness and patience of Christ, hold before the
 erring ones the words of the Lord.
     4. " LET the dead bury their dead." As we ordinarily read this,
 we form a mental picture of the man's father lying dead at home,
 with no one to give him a decent burial, and so Christ's words seem
 almost unfeeling. Now any view which causes one to think thus of
 Christ is to be suspected. Consider the case.           the East burial
 follows almost immediately after death. There is no long delay. If
  the man's father had been dead at that time, he would have been
 attending to his father's burial, instead of being there.
 response-to-Christ's call, 11.Yollow-lie,"The man ,said,-"-Snra

  to wait an indefinite time before taking hold of the Lord's work. It
  amounted to asking to be excused until after his father should die,
  and he could have an opportunity to settle up his affairs. 1-1,--was-the
-same,with-him-as.with-those_who.began to make excuse. Luke-14:
 .18: How many whom Christ is calling now are saying the same
  thing? Their temporal affairs must all be attended to before they
  can enter the Lord's service. To such He says, " Let the dead bury
  their dead ; but go thou and preach the gospel."
      5. " Go your ways ; behold, I send you forth as lambs among
   wolves." That is the true position of Christ's followers in the world.
80                LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE.

It is the nature of wolves to bite ; therefore, the lambs must expect
to be at least snapped at. They will certainly be annoyed by the
wolves; they may be bitten, and they may possibly be killed. "All
that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution." 2 Tim.
3 : 12. What are the lambs to do under the circumstances 7—Commit
themselves to the keeping of the Good Shepherd, who gives His life
for the sheep. " For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now
returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls." 1 Peter
2 : 25. " Wherefore, let them that suffer according to the will of God
commit the keeping of their souls to Him in well doing, as unto a
faithful Creator." 1 Peter 4: 19. Nobody ever heard of lambs at-
tacking wolves, nor even resisting them. The lamb always flees for
safety. There is such a thing as wolves in sheep's clothing ; and, if
anyone thinks that he has seen Christ's lambs biting and devouring,
let him know that they were disguised wolves. The figure means
simply this, that Christ's followers are to leave all force and oppo-
sition to the world. They can no more use any manner of force
against those who resist the truth, than lambs can devour wolves.



         LESSON XXI11.—June 9, 1894.
         THE GOOD SAIIARITAN. Luke 10:17-37.

   IT is not so easy to analyze a chapter that contains instruction only
as it is to analyze one that consists wholly of narrative. The danger
always lies in too close an analysis ; that is, instead of simply noting
a few general heads, allowing them to suggest to the mind all the
details, the student will attempt to repeat the details. Many will
doubtless think it easier to commit a passage to memory, so as to be
able to repeat it word for word, than to get sufficient knowledge of
it to be able to give a synopsis of it and an intelligent narrative of
the details. But the former should not be done. You might be able
to repeat an entire chapter, and still really know but little about
it, but it is impossible to study it as indicated and not receive much
valuable knowledge. You have doubtless found that this lesson nat-
urally divides itself as follows : The return of the seventy, thanks-
giving and blessing, the lawyer's question, which led to the story of
the good Samaritan.
    1. With what feelings did the seventy return 7
    2. What did they say?
    3. What did Jesus reply?
    4. How much power did Ile say Ile had given them
                 LESSONS ON THE BOOS OE LUKE.                       81

   5. In what were they to rejoice?
   6. For what did Jesus rejoice and thank God?
   7. Who alone knows who the Son is?
   8. How only can any man know the Father?
   9. With what did Jesus say the disciples were blessed?
10. Do we share the same blessing?
 dl. What question did a lawyer ask Jesus?
12. Did Jesus answer the question directly?
13. To what did He refer the lawyer for an answer?
14. What scripture did the lawyer quote?
15. Then what did Jesus say?
  16. What question did the lawyer then ask?
  17. Why did he ask that question?
  18. How did Jesus answer it?
  19. Relate the story of the man that was robbed, and the good
Samaritan.
  20. When Jesus had finished, what question did He ask the lawyer?
  21. Who did the lawyer say was neighbor to the poor man?
  22. What did Jesus then say to him?

                                NOTES.
   1. " THou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and
hast revealed them unto babes." And where are they hid?—In
Christ, for in Him are " hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowl-
edge." Col. 2: 3. Whoever, therefore, will receive Christ, may
know the hidden things. But it is not by human wisdom, but by
faith, that Christ is to be received. " Let not the wise man glory in
his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not
the rich man glory in his riches ; but let him that glorieth glory in
this, that he understandeth and knoweth Me, that I am the Lord
which exercise loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the
earth ; for in these things I delight, saith the Lord." Jer. 9 : 23, 24.
" Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not
enter into the kingdom of heaven." Matt. 18 : 3. " Whosoever
shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in nowise
enter therein." Luke 18 : 17. Therefore, the things of God are re-
vealed to all who are willing to take the wisdom of God in place of
their own. The Spirit of God searches all things, even " the deep
things of God," and is freely given to us to make known the things
 that are freely given to us of God. 1 Cor. 2 : 10-12. And it is given
 to all who ask for it. Luke 11 : 13.
  2. " Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind;
and thy neighbor as thyself." This, and this only, is the condition
32                 LESSONS ON THE HOOK Or LUKE.

 of life. But who has met the conditions?—Not one; for all one's
 heart, soul, strength, and mind, mean all his life, not simply a few
 days or years of it. If one had lived wholly for self half his life, and
 then it were possible to turn completely about and serve the Lord
 with all his mind and strength the remainder of his days, he would
 not have served the Lord with all his heart, soul, strength, and mind,
 any more than if he had half served the Lord all his days. Who,
 then, can be saved?—Only he who gives up his whole life, past and
 present, to the Lord, and takes in exchange Christ's life. The per-
 fect life of Christ will be put in place of the sinful life that is past,
 and the mind of Christ in him now will be as loyal to God as it was
 in the person of Jesus of Nazareth. In short, the condition of eternal
 life is to receive it from the Lord. He who allows the life of God to
 manifest itself in his mortal flesh, will finally have that same eternal
 life in his immortal flesh.
    3. " WHO is my neighbor? " Read the story and see. It is every-
 body that is in distress, everyone with whom we come in contact,
 everyone for whom Christ died. " I am debtor both to the Greeks,
and to the Barbarians ; both to the wise, and to the unwise." Rom.
1 : 14.
    4. IN this lesson we have an example of the quality of mercy. The
Jew had no claim upon the Samaritan. The Jews had no dealings
 with the Samaritans (John 4: 9), and so much did they despise them
that the woman at the well was astonished that Jesus would ask her
for a drink of water, The worst thing that the Jews could think of
 to say about Christ was to call Him a Samaritan; and to say that He
 was a Samaritan was in their minds equivalent to saying that He had
a devil. John 8 : 48. They regarded the Samaritans as dogs. The
Jews, therefore, had done nothing to merit kindness at the hands of
the Samaritans. Yet this Samaritan did great kindness to the Jew,
 who would doubtless have spit upon him if he had seen him in the
same situation. It is said that the Samaritan had mercy upon the
other. Therefore mercy is the treatment of people better than they
deserve. It is the showing of kindness toward those who have no
just claim to any consideration. Now remember that God "delight-
eth in mercy." Micah 7 : 18. He is "plenteous in mercy." Ps.
103 : 8. " For as the' heaven is high above the earth, so great [or
powerful] is His mercy toward them that fear Him." Ps. 103 : 11.
   God, \vim is rich in mercy, for His great love wherewith He loved us,
even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with
Christ (by grace are ye saved); and hath raised us up together, and
made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus; that in the
ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace, in His
kindness toward us, through Christ Jesus." Eph. 2 : 4-7. " Let us
therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain
mercy, and find grace to help in time of need." Heb. 4 : 16.

        LESSON XXFV.—June 16, 1894.
  ASKING AND RECEIVING. Luke 10 : 38-42; 11 : 1-13.

   IN all study of the Scriptures one thing should be carefully avoided,
namely, falling into the habit of studying them as we would a lesson
in history. To be sure, history should not be studied merely for the
facts which may be learned, but for the lessons taught by those facts.
Still, there is a vast difference between the Bible and any other book.
It alone has life to bestow. There is life in the word, and the object
of study should be to receive that life. " The words that I speak
unto you, they are spirit, and they are life." John 6: 63. Never-
theless, this does not do away with the necessity of having a thorough
knowledge of all the facts recorded in the Bible, but rather increases
it. For since the life is in the word, it becomes very important that
we have the exact word. Strive to get as close a knowledge as possi-
ble of the contents of every chapter studied, but never let your study
degenerate into a mere intellectual exercise. Study always with the
heart open to the influence of the Holy Spirit. Be in the position of
listening to the voice of God.
   In this lesson we have Jesus in the house of Mary and Martha, and
 Martha's anxiety; the Lord's prayer, and illustrations of the readiness
 of God to answer prayer.
    1. As Jesus was journeying, who received Him into her house?
    2. Who Was her sister?
    3. How were the two women occupied while Jesus was present?
    4. What did Martha desire of Jesus?
    5. What gentle reproof did He give her?
    6. What did He say of Mary's course?
    7. As Jesus ceased praying, on a certain occasion, what request did
one of His disciples make?
    8. Repeat the words that Jesus uttered in reply.
    9. Give the first illustration that Jesus used to show the confidence
that we may have that God will answer our prayers.
  10. What positive assurance did He give of this?
  11. Who receives? Who finds? To whom is the door opened 9
Is there any exception?
  12. What questions did Jesus ask about a father and his son?
  13. What would a man "that is a father" do in such a case?
  14. What lesson is drawn concerning God's willingness to give?
  16. Why is God much more ready to give the Holy Spirit to those
who ask Him, than earthly parents are to give good gifts to their chil-
dren?
84                 ttssoxs ON THE BOOR Or LUKE.

                                NOTES.
    1. " OUR FATHER." Although God is the great Creator, He is also
 our Father. " Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord
 pitieth them that fear Him." Ps. 103 : 13. " For as many as are
 led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. . . . And if
 children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ."
 Rom. 8 : 14-17. God is no respecter of persons, and has no special
 favorites among His children, for He loves us the same as He does Jesus.
 John 17 : 23. Therefore everything that Christ inherits, we shall
 share with Him. " Behold, what manner of love the Father hath be-
 stowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God." 1 John
3 : 1.
    2. " Wnica art in heaven." That means that He can do whatever
 He wishes. " But our God is in the heavens; He hath done whatsoever
 He hath pleased." Ps. 115 : 3. " 0 Lord God of our fathers, art not
 Thou God in heaven? and rulest not Thou over all the kingdoms of
 the heathen? and in Thine hand is there not power and might, so that
 none is able to withstand Thee? " 2 Chron. 20 : 6. He who begins
 his prayer with the words, " Our Father who art in heaven," under-
standing and accepting all that they mean, already has the answer.
    3. " THY kingdom come." This is a petition for the appearing of
 Christ, for that is when the kingdom comes. 2 Tim. 4: 1; Matt.
25: 31; Luke 19: 11, 12, 15. But since before the end comes the
gospel of the kingdom must be preached in all the world, for a witness
unto all nations (Matt. 24: 14), the prayer for the coming of Christ
and His kingdom is really a prayer for the Lord to send out laborers
into the harvest; and that means, first of all, " Here am I; send me."
    4. " THY will be done, as in heaven, so in earth." The will of
God is His law. Rom. 2 : 17, 18. The angels "do His commandments,
hearkening unto the voice of His word." P. 103: 20. Therefore,
the prayer for God's will to be done on earth as it is in heaven, is a
prayer for the time to come when all on earth will do His command-
ments, hearkening unto the voice of His word. And that will be only
when those who will not do the will of God have been cut off from
the earth. And so this .prayer offered in sincerity is the complete
surrender and submission of ourselves to God, that in all things He
may work in us both to will and to do of His good pleasure.
   5. " GIVE us day by day our daily bread." This is an acknowledg-
ment that we are dependent on the Lord day by day for our bread.
Not only so, but it is an expression of content that we are so dependent.
   6. "AND forgive us our sins." No Christian ever gets beyond
the utterance of that prayer. " If we confess our sins, He is faith-
ful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all un-
                  LESSONS ON THE BOOK OF LUKE.                         86

righteousness." 1 John 1 : 9. No person is ever so near to God, and
so fully cleansed from sin, as when humbly acknowledging his own
sinfulness to God; for only in confessing our own utter lack of right-
eousness can we be filled with the fullness of God's righteousness.
" If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth
is not in us." 1 John 1 : 8. Because in that case we charge God with
lying, in that He says we are sinners. But when we acknowledge the
truth of God's words in every particular, then we are agreed with
Him; His will is ours, and therefore He must pronounce us righteous.
But let it be remembered that God alone can truthfully declare one to
be righteous. That must ever be left to Him. No man may say it of
himself.
  7. Do not read Luke 11 : 5-8 as though it were an illustration of
how God receives the prayers of His people. It is a comparison by
contrast. The ease-loving man grants the request of his friend only
in order that he may avoid being further disturbed. But God gave
Himself, His own life, for us, in Christ. He found joy in denying Him-
self for us. " For the joy that was set before Him [He] endured the
cross." Heb. 12 : 2. As He gave His life for us, He lives only to save
us. It is His good pleasure to give us the kingdom. Luke 12 : 32.
" He delighteth in mercy." Micah 7 : 18. That is, not simply in
pleasing His friends, but in blessing those who are enemies. The les-
son to be learned, therefore, is that if a selfish man will arouse himself
to grant a favor, how much more may we expect help from the Lord,
who is listening to hear the first whisper of prayer.
   8. This is emphasized by what follows. No one that " is a father"
will ever disregard the cry of his children for food. Neither will he
tantalize them, nor deceive them. The one chief thought of a man
" that is a father " is that his children may be properly cared for.
To this end he will toil even night and day. Now God is a Father,
but He is as much better and mote considerate a Father than any
earthly father, as He is better and greater than man. Men are by
nature selfish and evil; God is perfect in goodness. He is infinitely
more willing and better able to help us than earthly parents are to
care for their children. Therefore there is not the shadow of a doubt
that He will give the Holy Spirit to us when we ask it, and that means
the giving of all spiritual blessings. Let these truths not be received
as a theory, but grasped as facts.

         LESSON XXV.—June 23, 1894.
        THE POWER OF CHRIST. Luke 11 : 14-36.

   IN this lesson verses 14-26 relate to the casting out of a dumb de-
mon, the blasphemous charge of the Pharisees, and Christ's rebuke to
them, showing the inconsistency of their assertion that He cast out
devils through the prince of devils. The remainder of the lesson per-
tains chiefly to signs. A rebuke is given to those who look for signs
instead of depending on the word of God ; and the necessity of having
light in one's self, through the word, is emphasized.
    1. Tell the result of Christ's casting out a demon that was dumb.
    2. What did some of the people say?
    3. How did Jesus show the foolishness of their charge?
    4. If Satan were divided against himself, what would be the re-
sult?
    5. What question did Jesus ask the doubters about their sons?
    6. What did He say had come unto them?
    7. Under what conditions are a man's goods safe?
    8. When does he lose them?
    9. Since Christ took Satan's captives from him, what did that
prove?
  10. Who are against Christ? Who are scattering abroad?
  11. Relate .what Jesus said about the unclean spirit going out of a
man and returning.
  12. Under what circumstance can it enter again?
  13. If it enters the man again, what will be his condition?
  14. Who did Jesus say are blessed?
  15. For what did Jesus reprove the people?
  16. What sign only did He say should be given them?
  17. By whose course did He say the men of that generation would
be condemned?
  18. To whose word did the queen of Sheba listen?
  19. Whose preaching convinced the Ninevites
  20. Why would their action condemn the men to whom Jesus was
speaking?
  21. Will the same thing apply in these days
  22. When a man lights a candle, what does he do with it?
  23. What is the light of the body?
  24. How only may the whole body be full of light?

                               NOTES.

  1. " OTHERS, tempting Him, sought of Him a sign from heaven."
This was the same temptation that had been met in the wilderness.
The devil was still trying to get Him to do something fot the express
purpose of silencing unbelief, without any reference to the-benefit of
men. All Christ's works were works of mercy. He performed them
naturally, as the opportunity and necessity for them arose in His daily
life. But He never did anything in answer to a challenge. If the
regular work of the ministry of the gospel will not convince men,
they will not be convinced by a mere exhibition- of knowledge or skill,
in answer to a challenge.
  2. JESUS 11:1d just done a wonderful work, in casting out a devil,
and still they asked for a sign. What greater thing could He have
clone before them? They would not believe though He cast out a legion
of devils. The gospel itself is a miracle. Satan works in every nat-
ural or unconverted man. Eph. 2: 1, 2. Therefore when a man is
converted and exhibits the fruits of righteousness instead of the works
of the flesh, that is an instance of the casting out of the evil spirit by
the Spirit of God. Therefore it is that the godly lives of Christians are
the best testimonies to the power of the gospel. See Isa. 43 : 10; John
17 : 21-23.
  3. TIIE fact that Christ cast out devils was proof enough that He
was from God ; for Satan would not seek to destroy his own kingdom.
Christ came upon Satan and took from him all his armor wherein he
trusted, and divided his spoils. "And having spoiled principalities
and powers, He made a show of them openly, triumphing over them
in it," that is, in His cross, or in Himself. Col. 2 : 15. All power in
heaven and in earth is given to Christ, therefore Satan has no power
at all in a contest with Him. These demonstrations of Christ's power
over evil spirits were recorded for our encouragement in our conflict
with evil. He has overcome the world ; therefore our faith in .Him is
the victory that overcometh the world.
  4. " HE that is not with Me is against Me." There is no middle
ground ; everyone that has not the Spirit of Christ has the spirit of
Satan. Christ must be " all in all."
   5. CHRIST is able to cast out the unclean spirit, but only His contin-
ued presence can keep it out. " He that is not with Me is against Me."
If, when the heart has been cleansed, it is not intrusted fully to the
care of the Lord, the evil spirit will return, and then the man will be
worse than before. A backslider or an apostate is worse than one who
has never known the Lord.

          LESSON XXVI.—June 3o, 1894.

      FALSE PROFESSION REPROVED. Luke II : 37-54.

     THE principle of these lessons being that of continual review, it is
  not necessary to say anything special for the close of the quarter.
  Remember that you are not studying for examination, nor to make a
  good showing in class, but for the purpose of becoming acquainted
  with God's word, and thereby with God Himself. With this object in
• view you will at all times do the most faithful work possible.
     The subject of this lesson is well outlined by the title. If' this por-
  tion of Scripture is well learned, it will afford a key to a great deal of
  the Bible.

     I. As Jesus was teaching, who asked Him to dinner?
     2. What caused the Pharisee to marvel?
     3. What did Jesus say of the Pharisees?
     4. What about that which is without and that which is within'?
     5. Then if the inside be unclean, what about the whole?
     6. For what did Jesus pronounce a woe upon the Pharisees?
     7. Is it wrong, or is it right, to pay tithes?
     8. Then where was their sin?
     9. For what course in public places did Jesus reprove the Phari-
 sees?
    10. To what did He liken them?
    11. What did one of the lawyers say of Christ's talk to the Phari-
 sees?
    12. For what did Jesus then pronounce a woe upon the lawyers?

                               NOTES.
   1. '' MAN looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh
on the heart." 1 Sam. 16: 7. "As he thinketh in his heart, so is
he." Prov. 23: 7. "A good man out of the good treasure of his
heart bringeth forth that which is good ; and an evil man out of the
evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil." Luke
6: 45. Out of the heart are the issues of life. Prov. 4: 28. What a
man appears to be,—that is, what he is outwardly,—is of little conse-
quence ; his character is determined by what is within, which \mum
cannot see. " He is not a jew:which is one outwardly; neithest, is
that circumcision which is outward in the flesh ; but he is a Jew, whit ,
is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit,
and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God." Rom.
2: 28, 29.
   2. !‘ BUT rather give alms of such things as ye have." The Re-
vised Version has it, " Howbeit give for alms those things which are
within." The value of any man's service is determined by what he
is. It is the broken and contrite spirit that makes the sacrifice a real
one. Everyone must give himself. If Christ dwells within, then
every act done is acceptable to God ; if Christ is not formed within,
the greatest effort, and toil, and pains, are nothing. See Micah. 6: 6-8.
   3. " TuEsE ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other un-
done." The demonstrative " these '' always applies to the timings
nearest ; " those," to things remote. The Saviour therefore said, Ye
ought to do judgment and the love of God ; and ye ought not to leave
tithing undone. "All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of
the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord's ; it is holy unto the
Lord." Lev. 27 : 30. That is all that need be said about it, except
to ask, " Will a man rob God? " Mal. 3 : 8. We cannot give a tithe
to the Lord, for it is His already; but we may rob Him by retaining it.
Here is a test as to a man's honesty. The man who gives to every
moan his due, except to one man, whom he systematically defrauds,
cannot be called an honest man. God is greater than man, and to
mb Him is a greater sin than to rob man. Yet many men who would
spurn the idea that they would rob their fellowmen, will rob God
without any compunctions of conscience. Why?—Because God does
not at once make requisition for that of which He has been defrauded,
and they are not found out. Those who, knowing the Scriptures, rob
God under such circumstances, thereby show that they would defraud
their fellowmen if there were no fear of detection and immediate
punishment.
  4 " I i love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings
in the markets." Praise and honor from men are bestowed only be-

cause of what appears out wardly, for no man can see what is within.
Therefore those who love praise will pay attention only to that which
is without, and to do that is sill. " Holy can ye believe, which receive
honor one of another, and seek not the honor that eorneth from God
only? " John 5 : 44.
  5. ON verses 49-51 see 2 Chron. 24 : 20-22. Jehoida had done great
kindness to Joash. After his death Joash and the princes of Judah
conspired to leave the house of the Lord, and serve idols. Zechariah,
the son of Jehoida, reproved them for transgressing the command-
ments of the Lord, and they stoned him to death. Their murdering
him was exactly of the same nature as their idolatry, and was the nat-
ural result of it. Therefore all who stubbornly transgress the com-
mandments of the Lord have murder in their 'hearts. The Pharisees
and lawyers were rejecting Christ Himself, of whom all the prophets
testified, and who was greater than all of them together. Therefore
in rejecting Him the blood of all the martyrs came upon them. But
the same thing is true of all who reject the teaching of Christ, even
though He is not visibly present.
   6. THE Pharisees dogged the steps of Christ continually, to find
some cause of accusation against Him. On this occasion they began to
overwhelm Him with questions of the most exasperating nature, in
hopes of provoking Him to a hasty retort. But nothing of the kind
could they get from His lips. The servant of Christ will often be
placed in similar circumstances. Unreasonable and wicked men, who
have not faith, will ask questions, not sincerely, but as a trap. There
is where he will need the greatest wisdom. Sometimes it may be best,
although it will cost the greatest effort, to make no reply. " I said, -
I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue ; I will
keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me. I was
dumb with silence ; I held my peace, even from good." Ps. 39 : 1, 2.
In all cases he will require more than human wisdom. Indeed, since
no one but Christ has ever given a perfectly discreet answer to every
question, it is evident that He alone can do it. Therefore the servants
of Christ are warranted in expecting, not only when before governors
and kings, but at all times, the fulfillment of the words, " It is not
ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you."
Matt. 10 : 20.
