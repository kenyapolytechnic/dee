         SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS AND PUPILS.
                         Please Read Carefully.
    Do not be satisfied with formally looking over the lesson. Do
not be satisfied with even a fair study of the text cited at the close
of each question. The life of Christ can not be learned from any
single account of an evangelist, for the reason that some details
omitted by one are silpplied by another. In fact, some incidents
in the life of Christ are entirely omitted by one or more of His
biographers. This statement will be more fully appreciated by
comparing the tables of contents in the accounts of the four evan-
gelists, as shown by any Harmony of the Gospels.
    But it is not enough simply to know historically the life of Christ.
His doings and sayings should be studied for the spiritual force
which may be derived from them. This can not be accomplished
by passing hastily over the lessons. Let every one, then, take
time to meditate on them, not forgetting to ask for the illuminating
power of the Holy Spirit. Earnest, faithful study of these lessons
is sure to bring to the student "a breadth of mind, a nobility of
character, and a stability of purpose that are rarely seen in these
times."

THE SURPLUS DONATIONS during the present quarter will be
  used in the most needy foreign fields.

                                NOTES.
   1. Our last lesson left the Saviour in Jerusalem, where the Jews
were seeking to kill Him. John 5 : 18. The place of John's
imprisonment, according to Josephus, was in the, strong fortress
of Malchlerus, nearly northeast of Jerusalem, on the frontiers of
Arabia. Later, at the time of the Baptist's death, Herod had his
court in a mansion adjoining the prison.
   2. It is difficult to determine how long after Christ's baptism this

 tour of Galilee began: We know, however, that a great part of
 that interval was spent in Judea. The purpose of this is easily
 perceived. It seemed necessary to spend much time at first in the
 vicinity of Jerusalem, in order to give the leading Jews an oppor-
 tunity to decide concerning His Messiahship. John having been
 rejected and cast into prison, Jesus proceeded to Galilee, there to
 call the twelve disciples, and to enter more fully upon His ministry.
 There is no record of His being much in Judea after this, except at
 the annual feasts, where He appeared in harmony with the require-
 ments of the Levitical law.
     3. At the scene of His childhood, South, and young manhood,—
 at the very point where He was best known,—He gave His personal
 acquaintances the same opportunity that had been afforded the
,people of Judea.
     4. " Capernaum " means the village of Nahum. It was on the
 west shore of the Sea of Galilee, near its head, or northern end,
 and was the boundary town between the territory of Philip and
 Antipas, hence contained a custom-house and garrison. Luke
5 : 27; 7 : 2.

    1. " Sea of Galilee;" so called because of the province of that

flame, which formed its western shore. It was also known as Lake
Gennesaret, because of a most beautiful and fertile plain by that,
name, which bordered oti• one of its northwestern indentures; it
was called the Sea of Tiberias, from the city of Tiberias, which was
located on its western shore ; and, in ancient times, it was called
the Sea of Chinnereth, from a town of that - name near it. See
Num. 34 : it ; Josh. 12 :3 ; 19 : 35.
    2. Some months before this, these men had voluntarily, but
temporarily, it seems, joined themselves to Christ, as related in
John 1 :35 -42. No one had, as yet, fully united as colabOrer with
Christ. These men had listened to His teaching and witnessed
 His            but, having also seen the combination of religious
leader zgainst Christ, they had found relief in assuming their
former occupation.
    3. These were words only of discouragement. All night Peter
had toiled in vain. "During the lonely hours he had thought
of the fate of John the Baptist, who was languishing alone in his
dungeon. He had thought of the prospect before Jesus and His
followers, of the ill success of the mission to Judea, and the malice
 of the priests and rabbis. Even his own occupation had failed
 him ; and as he watched by the empty nets, the future had seemed
 dark with discouragement.".—Desire of Ages, p. 245.
• 4. Conflicting emotions overcame the erring disciple. He had,
in great measure, lost sight of Christ's calling, of which he had
been convinced a few months before. His was now the cry of
self-loathing, as his true self of unbelief and unholiness was
clearly revealed by the flash of supernatural illumination.
   5. A strong expression, literally, "be thou muzzled." The
Lord would not recognize this satanic testimony to His office and
work. But His calm intrepidity gave force to His word of author-
ity; and a dignified standing to His hem7enly message. For further
comments on this case, see " Desire of Ages," pp. 255, 256.

                                NOTES.
     r. It appears that, although Peter's home had shortly before
 been at Bethsaida (John 1: 44), a little southwest of Capernaum, on
 the sea, he was at this time living in the house with his wife's,
 mother in the latter place. On this particular occasion James and
 John, as well as Andrew and Peter, were present.
     2. Jewish tradition had placed so many restrictions around the
 Sabbath that none were supposed, on that day, to make a journey
 of more than two thousand paces.. It was also considered unlawful
 to heal the sick on that day. Luke 6 : 7; 13 : 14; John 5 : 18; 9 : 16.
 These regulations gave the Saviour a short respite from labor.
 But from the report of the incident in the synagogue during the
service of the day, every one was in expectation. All knew where
 Jesus was quartered, and as soon as the trumpet blast announced
 the Sabbath closed, all the people of that region flocked to Peter's
 house, bringing their sick with them. Every disease was there
 represented,—leprosy, fever, asthma, consumption, dropsy, palsy,
 deaf, dumb, and those possessed with devils.
     3. Leprosy was a loathsome disease of that day, supposed by
.some to be similar to the worst form of modern elephantiasis. It
 began in small specks on the eyelids or hands, and spread until
 it affected every part of the body, causing angry swellings and
 putrefying sores. From the skin it ate through the tissues to the
 bones, rotting the entire body by degrees. When the malady
 arrived at this stage, death was a welcome messenger. The man
 in this case was " full " of the dread disease which debarred him
 from approaching a member of the community, or permitting
 another to come toward him without his giving the warning cry,
                           LIFE OF CIiRiSt.

" Unclean, unclean." Faith alone in the saving power of Christ,
after hearing of and perhaps seeing from afar His wonderful work,
could possibly have induced him to be so bold.
     4: .It was   early in the ministry of Christ for so great a stir
to be made as was sure to follow public announcement of such
miraculous healing, as it would likely precipitate undue opposition
from the priests, and this would interfere with the intended work
of Christ. See Isa. 42 : 2,4: So the word was, "See thou soy
nothing to any man." Jesus knew that it was better to let the
priest decide that the man's leprosy was departed, and so publish
it, as the law required.

   1. %would seem that the place chosen by the Saviour in which.
temporarily to retire from public gaze, was east of the Sea of
Galilee. A large part of this district was uninhabited, especially
the cliffs, wherein were the monuments and tombs of the dead.:
Matt. 8 : 28.
   2. " These were of the rabbis or ' masters ' in Israel. They
were called ' scribes ' from the Hebrew safthar (to write). The
rabbinical law was known as the ' words of the Sopherim.'. They
14                       LIFE OF CHRIST.

were also named ' lawyers,' and doctors of the law,' because
they taught the law to the people. They were sometimes referred
to as Pharisees, because the large majority of them were of that
sect, but all rabbis were not Pharisees, nor all Pharisees rabbis.
Their influence was wide-spread, though their numbers were not
large. On this occasion they came as spies,—emissaries from
those who hated Jesus,—having before sought His life for healing
a cripple. John 5 : 2-46."—Geikie's Life and Words of Christ,
vol. 2, p. 578.
    3. "Eastern houses had outside stairs leading to the roofs.
Matt. 24 : 17. The roof constructions were light rafters stretched
from wall to wall, on which were thickly and evenly laid short
sticks. Over these was a layer of fine brush-wood, with a coating
of mortar next. Over all this was spread an earthy substance, com-
posed of carbonate of lime, clay, and sand. In cases of poverty,
common earth, mixed with ashes, lime, and chopped straw, was
used. To break up such a roof was merely to scrape back the
dirt, and remove the short sticks."—Geikie's Life and Words of
Christ; vol. 2, fi. 22.
    4. The word here translated "son " is riot huios (son), but
teknon (a child), implying that the paralytic was young.
    5. Jesus does not ask which is easier to do, but to say. One
might say, "Thy sins are forgiven," and no one know whether it
were so or not. This would be easy; but to say, " Rise up and
walk," is a test of power to be determined by an outward demon-
stration. It is harder to say this and maintain it. To demonstrate
the power of His word, He said that which would produce unques-
tioned evidence of His heavenly origin.
    6. All traffic landed at Capernaum, either from across the lake,
or by the highways, had to pay duties. Men were stationed at
every avenue Ito collect these tolls, or taxes. These publicans
became so greedy of gain as to be almost intolerable, and so
received the execrations of the people. None were more hated.
Every Israelite who became a publican was ostracized, and
declared incompetent to bear witness in courts of law.. They
were classed with robbers and murderers. The families of such
were also disgraced. See " Desire of Ages," p. 272.

       " 'Sinners,' a name given indiscriminately to usurers, gam-
blers, thieves, publicans, shepherds, and sellers of fruit grown in
the Sabbath years."—Geikie, vol. 2, P. 30.
   2. Mercy is that quality of disposition which leads us to treat
an offender better than he deserves. These sinners did not deserve
Christ's presence, but He showed mercy to them, and so rebuked
the haughty, self-contained Pharisees, who felt themselves too good
to mingle, socially, with any but those of their own caste. Christ
associated with those sinners who felt themselves to be such, and
needy, in preference to attending the gatherings of the Pharisees,
who were righteous in their own estimation, and felt no need
of help.
    3. This language could not refer to the earthen bottles, but to
those made of goat skins, which were common in the East. They
 were of different sizes. The larger ones, in which water was
carried for domestic purposes, were Made from the tough skins
of he goats. Smaller ones, such as were used for drinking pur-
 poses on journeys, were made from kid skins. They grew brittle

with age, and then would not bear the expansion produced by
the fermentation of new wine.
   4. It was not counted wrong, ordinarily, to pluck and eat all the
grain one's hunger demanded; nor was the journey on that day
accounted wrong, since the Pharisees themselves were along. It
was, however, considered wrong by these fault-finders to satisfy
hunger in that way on the Sabbath, but only by a law of their own
making. The Sabbath law is silent regarding such details. The
Mishna (a collection of rabbinical rules and precepts), however,
lays down such minute restrictions regarding Sabbath observance
as even to forbid. a tailor going out with his needle, near sundown,
on the approach of the Sabbath, lest he forget, and carry it with
him on the Sabbath.

   I. There was much involved in these questions, to cut the
proud, deceitful Pharisees to the heart. The queries really con-
trasted His life and work with theirs.
   2. " He stretched it out," withered though it had been. The
power to do so was in the word by which the action was com-
manded. Christ's enemies were by this method foiled in their
efforts to find in the act of Christ a violation of the Sabbath law.
The Saviour was indignant at their voluntary blindness, yet He
                         LIFE OF CHRIST.                               19


carefully wrought so as to give them no hold on Him. Ordering
the crippled man to stand forth in plain sight of them all, He laid
no hand on him. He did not even question him. He but spoke,
and the man was healed. It was not unlawful to speak on the
Sabbath, even by their most rigorous rule of observance. But
they were filled with "senseless rage': (Greek of Luke 6: it) at
what •they witnessed, and were more determined than ever to
destroy Jesus.
    3. The Herodians had been regarded by the Pharisees as apos-
tate, on account of their alliance with the Roman power, and
consequent imitation of heathen practises. So far had they gone
in flattery of the reigning house that they tried to represent Herod
the Great as the promised Messiah. (Farrar's " Life-of--C—hrist72'
                  This, of course, made them the natural enemies of
Christ and His work. The Pharisees, in their mad rage, were
willing to be reconciled to such a hateful sect, in order to secure
their cooperation to destroy One holding doctrines so noble as to
shame their lives", even though no other charge could be sustained
against Him.

                                NOTES.

    r. These twelve had for some time been disciples, i. e learners.
Upon their ordination they were called apostles, or those sent forth.
They were sent forth to represent the Gospel church, as the
twelve patriarchs had represented the tribes of Israel. See
"Desire of Ages," pp. 291,292. For knowledge of the digpositions
of these men, see " Desire of Ages," p. 296.
    2. The ordination of the twelve is supposed to have taken place
on one of the two horn-like heights of Hattin.. These were two
hours' journey (from five to seven miles) west of Tiberias, over-
looking the mouth of a gorge which opens into the cliffs of Arbela.
The "plain" below these heights, to which the Saviour descended
with His apostles, was easily accessible from the lake, yet only a
few minutes' walk from the summit. This plain was a level space
on the side-hill, well adapted for the gathering of a multitude. See
" Desire of Ages," p. 299.
    3. The Jews had come to believe that the amount of riches one
possessed indicated the favor he had with God. Christ's teaching
in this text was to destroy that illusion.
     4. No wonder they were astonished. They had been accustomed
 to the verbal trifling of intricate sophisiries, and the tortuous wind-
 ings of tradition and prescription. They now heard these criticized
and rejected for the plain., ungarnished Word. The great Teacher
 came not from any of the authorized schools, yet His teaching was
 fresh as the morning breeze upon the mountain-side. He appealed
 to no authority but the Word of God, tearing away from the law
 the false traditions which obscured its obvious import.

                             NOTES.


    r. Several items serve to make this an interesting account.
The centurion was counted a heathen by the Jews, but while in
command of the Roman post at Capernaum, he had been so
favorably impressed with the Jewish religion as to build for them
a synagogue at that place. No particular favor was asked for the
centurion, but his anxiety was for a servant,—a slave,—generally
considered as a thing rather than a fierson. Mommsen says that
all the miseries of negro slavery were a drop in the ocean com-
pared to the slaves of those days. Yet this man's tenderness for
his slave prompted him to send to Jesus, whom he had never seen,
for relief for his beloved slave. Matthew sets forth the centurion
 24                       LIFE OF CHRIST.

 as making the appeal, on the principle that the Jewish elders rep-
  resented him. Compare Matt. 2o: 20 with Mark I0: 35 for a
 similar case.
     2. Here was a strange saying. One regarded as a heathen was
 found to have more genuine faith than was in all Israel. And on
 what ground?—Simply that of .believing that the word alone was
 able to produce the desired result. In this artless faith was a con-
 fession that Christ had godlike power, and was, therefore, able to
 heal' the sick by His word. This was greater faith than any one
 among the Jews possessed, even though that people professed to
 be then expecting the Desire of Ages. It was indeed a marvelous
 faith.
     3. Nain,—the fair, the beautiful,—was more than twenty miles
 from Capernaum, on the northwest slope of Little Hermon, in full
 view of Tabor and the heights of Zebulon. The most common
 route to that point from Capernaum was to go by boat to the
 south end of the lake, then pass down the Jordan Valley to the
 point where the ravines of Esdraelon slope down to it. Passing
thence to the west between Mount Tabor and Endor, the journey
 was easily accomplished in less than a day. But the fact that
 "much people" were following Christ on this journey renders it
questionable about His having taken this lake route.
    4. To die childless was counted a terrible calamity among the
Jews, and to have their offspring entirely cut off was regarded a
direct punishment for some sin. This woman was already a
widow, and was following her only son to the grave,—a most.
wretched affliction.
    5. It may be well to remember that Shunem, the place where
Elisha raised the " great " woman's son, was a village on the
opposite side of the very hill upon which Nain was situated, and
that the plain of Jezreel, the scene of the greatest events of
Elijah's life, stretched out in full view of the place. It was per-
haps the memory of these great prophets that called to the lips of
the people that another great prophet had arisen among them.
    6. John had been in prison for a long yet indefinite time.
Herod had relaxed his severity enough to permit visitors to see
                          LIFE OF CHRIST.                                    25


the prisoner frequently, as if almost ashamed to keep the innocent
one in confinement. Thus he could hear of Christ's doings, which
caused him much thought. John's ideas of the Messiah were evi-
dently those held in common with all the Jews,---that of the estab-
lishment of a pure theocracy on the earth. The thought was
therefore most natural, If He is the Messiah, why does He not
assume the throne of David? Why does He leave me to languish
in prison, who went before Him to proclaim His coming? Why
am I set aside, apparently forgotten, and my work permitted to
drop? (On this point see " Desire of Ages," p. 361.) These very
thoughts were calculated to bring despondency, unless he remem-
bered the lives of Moses and Elijah, who had been over the ground
before him. No wonder, then, that he had, and even ourselves
have, temporary seasons of depression, when looking at ourselves,
and the seeming lack of appreciation which follows one's pathway.

                             READING.
   Luke II : 14-36 ; Mark 3 : 22-31 ; " Desire of Ages," pp. 321=327.

                              NOTES.
    I. This was probably to draw the Saviour out ill private com-
pany in a way to compromise Himself, so that evidence might be
found against Him, sufficient to condemn Him. For evidence of
this, see Luke II : 37-54.
    2. The custom of the Jews_ was to sit at meals, having the feet
crossed beneath the body. See side texts with question 2. The
same custom now prevails in the East, with tables about a foot
high. In Christ's day the custom of the PersianS, Greeks, and
Romans, of reclining on cushions, had become common. The
guest lay on his left arm, with feet extended outside.
    3. For the master of a house to meet his guest with a kiss on
the cheek, and to invoke a blessing upon him, was a formal wel-
come. This was always followed by bringing water to wash the
guest's feet, in order to remove the dust. The head and beard
were next anointed with fragrant oil, either by the host or one of
his servants. This last was an especial point of etiquette.
    4. The Jews themselves pretended to cast out demons, but they
had never shown power to make the blind see, and the dumb
speak. This was what so hurt the proud Pharisees. They could
not deny the miracle, and what was.more, they saw that the com-
mon people would recognize its genuineness, and so they feared
the result.
    5. This was an expression meaning, " Is not this the Messiah? "
It was the first general public confession of Christ as to His true
mission, and it only angered the Pharisees.
    6. Beelzebub,—the filth god. Mark says they charged Him
with having an "unclean" spirit. The Phenicians assigned to
this god the power to inflict di;eases of all kinds. They implied
28 .                        LIFE OF CHRIST.

that the unclean spirit on Him had made Him mad, and turned
His brain. See also John ro : 20. When this report reached His
brethren, they went to take Him home, because they said He was
"beside Himself."
   7. Vast multitudes had followed John, and seemed temporarily
benefited by his ministrations. The old, unclean spirit had, for a
time, seemed to be gone out of the people. But inasmuch as they
refused to let God's Spirit.come in and fill them, Jesus predicted
that their old spirit, with others still worse, would come in to dwell
with them, and they would be worse than before. This was but tc
foretell His rejection by them. For application of the "diseased
eye," see " Desire of Ages," p. 322.

                               NOTES.
    t. The Pharisees were a sect of the Jews, who believed that all
the principles of the law needed to be elaborated, in order to he
understood by the common people. They had, therefore, in the
days of Christ, so elaborated these as to employ the entire worship
of the people in carrying out the multitudinous forms prescribed
for them. The lawyers are generally supposed to have been the
same as scribes,—Pharisees learned in the law. The term " law-
yer " was simply a title used in common parlance.
    2. Teaching by parable was a common method with Jewish
rabbis. Christ had not hitherto resorted to that form. By refer-
ence to Matthew, chapters 5 to 7, and all of Christ's early teaching,
it will be seen that He, at first, taught truth in the simplest manner.
The Jews, however, chose to find fault with this, and so, in speak-
ing to them, He adopted their chosen method, in order that they,
having deliberately rejected Him, might have the prophecy con-
cerning them fulfiled. See Isa. 6: 9, to, and the Sav;our's refer-
ence to it in Matt. 13 : 13-15, especially verse 15. It will be the •
same with us, also, unless we heed the plain teaching already
received concerning the truth.
    3. It will be noticed that each of these parables relates to some
particular phase of the one great subject,—the kingdom of God.
The first (tares) shows the kingdom entire before sin entered, its
corruption through sin, and its restoration. The next shows the
growth of the kingdom in the heart, and so on through the list.
These parables should'•be closely studied to get the most good
from the teaching of Christ relative to the kingdom of God.
    4. The word here used is the usual term for an earthquake. It
means a heavy, sudden storm, as the fury of a whirlwind, raging
from below upwards. The wild roaring of the wind, the blinding
torrents of rain, the thick darkness blotting out the stars, and the
sea- breaking over the boat, was enough to fill the 'stoutest hearts
with terror. Christ, however, seemed peacefully indifferent, as
 He rested from His excessive labors. When aroused,,He exhib-
ited no fear. His first thought was not of danger; His first word
 was not to the tempest; but His first care was for His disciples,
 that they might be quieted.

   1. Gadara was the fortified 'capital of Perea, the " country of
the Gadarenes" or Gergesenes. It was about eight miles southeast
from Tiberias. The present ruins of the city are about two miles
in circumference. The tombs were in the sides of the cliffs, round
about the city, some of which are still preserved, and used by
Arabs for dwellings.
    2. Mark and Luke speak of but one demoniac coming to Christ,
while Matthew introduces two. The lesson here given follows the
two former accounts, simply because they are more complete in
detail. While two demoniacs were present, probably one of them

made the prominent demonstrations, which would explain why
only one is mentioned by the two evangelists.
    3. "It was in mercy to the owners-of the swine that this loss had
been permitted to come upon them. They were absorbed in
earthly things, and cared not for the great interests of spiritual
life. Jesus desired to break the spell of selfish indifference, that
they might accept His grace. But regret and indignation for their
temporal loss blinded their eyes to the Saviour's mercy."—Desire
 of Ages, ft 338, 339.
    4. Jesus readily complied with the selfish request of the Ger-
gesenes to leave their coasts, even though He was deprived of the
needed rest He had sought in crossing the lake; for He knew that,
although He was to be absent in person, the restored demoniac
would proclaim the truth instead. The record states that he
" began to publish in Decapolis," meaning ten cities, the things
Jesus had done fot" him. Pliny says that this district reached from
Damascus on the north to Philadelphia on the south, and from
Scythopolis on the west to Canatha on the east. Six other cities
than those here mentioned were included: Hippos, Gadara, Pella,
Gerasa, Dion, and Raphana. All of these cities except Scythop-
olis were on the east side of the Jordan. "The two restored demo-
niacs were the first missionaries whom Christ sent to preach the
Gospel in the region of Decapolis. For a few moments only these
men had been privileged to hear the teachings of Christ. Not one
sermon from His lips had ever fallen upon their ears. They could
not instruct the people as the disciples who had been daily tvith
Christ were able to do. But they bore in their own persons the
evidence that Jesus was the Messiah. They could tell what they
knew, what they themselves had seen and heard and felt of the
power of Christ. This is what every one can do whose heart has
 been touched by the grace of God. . .            This is the witness
 for which our Lord calls, and for want, of which the world is per-
ishing."—Desire of Ages, p. 30.
    5. These " minstrels " were hired mourners, who kept up
continual di;cord on wind instruments, accompanied with wild
 howls of lamentation. The number of these mourners was in
 proportion to the wealth of the afflicted family.

                              NOTES.

   1. " Calling the twelve about Him, Jesus bade them go out two
and two through the towns and villages. None were sent forth
alone, but brother was associated with brother, friend with friend.
Thus they could help and encourage each other, counseling and
praying together, each one's strength supplementing the other's
weakness. In the same manner He afterward sent forth the
seventy. It was the Saviour's purpose that the messengers of the
Gospel should be associated in this way. In our own time evan-
gelistic work would be far more successful if this example were
more closely followed."—Desire of Ages, p. 350.
   2. It is said to have been while Herod Antipas was on a visit to
Rome, and was the guest of his brother Philip (not the tetrarch of
that name, but a son of Herod the Great by Mariamne, who,
being disinherited by his father, was living privately in Rome),
that he became ensnared by his brother's wife, and repaid the
hospitality he had received by eloping with her.
   3. Tradition says that Herodias ordered the body to be thrown
over the battlements of the palace, for dogs and vultures to devour.

Reduced Tract Prices
  TO OUR FRIENDS AND CUSTOMERS:
    We have reduced the price of the tracts published in the Bible
Students' and Apples of Gold Libraries.
    This has been done because we want you to use more of them,
and as you give the most of them away, you should get them as
cheap as possible.
    The price as now fixed is so very low that it can be allowed
only where 100 or More Tracts in Unbroken Packages are
ordered at a time, for example :

       THE RIGHT WAY                    THE WRONG WAY

    On " the right way " a discount would be allowed, as the 100
tracts are ordered in unbroken packages. On "the wrong way"
no discount would be allowed, although ioo tracts are ordered,
because packages are broken.
    When ordered " the right way " a discount of 4o per cent from
regular prices will be given.
    About twenty thousand pages of these tracts are sold daily,
and a strict adherence to this rule will effect an immense saving in
time, both in counting and billing—and you get its benefit.
     A new order sheet has just been prepared which gives the
number of tracts in a package, thus enabling you to conform to the
above rule. It's free. Ask your tract society for it.

                                        During the first 15 days in December, 189E, Chicago Station Houses sheltered
                                    642 homeless men. For the same time in 1896, 15,521 were thus sheltered; while
                                    for that time in 1897, the number was only limited by the capacity of the houses.
     It is such conditions as the above upon which our new book, &raids of frye morning,
treats; not that it is entirely devoted to the social question, however, but that it is entirely devoted to the
signs of our times, of which that perplexing question is a part. Farther than that, it introduces only
such signs as are of common occurrence, and which may be observed by every one. It is therefore a
book of general interest. The engravings are very fine; in fact they really illustrate the book. It will
probably be the easiest selling subscription book of the year.
