         OR many reasons the Quarter-Centennial Number of the
          SIGNS OF THE TIMES was a good thing. It was good in
          that it was instrumental in bringing scores of honest souls
to Christ; and in that it gave opportunity for hundreds to do self-
supporting missionary work.
     But we have in preparation something so much better, a num-
ber which so far surpasses the former one in every detail, as to
lead us to look for a circulation of two million copies instead of
half a million as we had before.
     The publication of the Quarter-Centennial Number taught us
several valuable lessons, one of which was that better articles as
well as engravings can be obtained when more time is allowed
writers and artists. Therefore we commenced to arrange for arti-
cles to go in this number early in the spring, and soon after invited
the artist who directed the illustrating of " The Desire of Ages"
to come to California and help in this special issue of the SIGNS.
He came and spent several weeks with us, planning and arranging
for the illustrations and cover design. As a result, the illustra-
tions will be as veritable a feast to the eyes as the articles will be
to the soul, and that is saying much. There will be twelve to
fifteen large pictures, together with a number of small illustrations
made especially to illustrate the subject matter, all of which we
believe will have a very active part in preaching the message.
     Now, the writers have had time to produce the best of articles;
the artists have had time to give us good engravings; we will have
time to do much better printing than before, and by getting it out
Nov. r—which will be done—you will have the very best time of
the year in which to take it to the people.

                  NOTE TO THE STUDENT.

   THE lessons of this quarter deepen in interest over preceding
lessons of the series, embracing as they do, a portion of the last
week of Christ's earthly ministry. The scenes they represent,
and the principles they teach, should be so carefully studied as to
become indelibly impressed upon the mind of every pupil. Ob-
servation has shown that preceding lessons have been too long
for the average class to cover in a single recitation. These have,
therefore, been purposely made shorter, that the interested recital
may not be hindered before reaching the end of the lesson. May
this part of the life of the divine Master, not only be studied for
recitation, but fully copied in the daily life of all concerned.

THE SURPLUS DONATIONS during the present quarter will be used in the
  most needy foreign fields.

                             READING.

   "Desire of Ages," chapter 62; "Spirit of Prophecy," vol. 2,
chapter 32.
                              NOTES.

   I. Some have concluded that the anointing of Jesus recorded
in Luke 7 : 36-5o, and the one described in Matt. 26 : 6-16, are the
same, because in " Desire of Ages " and in " Spirit of Prophecy,"
vol. 2, the two accounts are blended in one. This is not a neces-
sary conclusion, because we find similar events spoken of in the
same connection in the Scriptures, as though they were one and
the same, and yet they were far removed from each other in point
of time. The prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem and the
second coming of Christ, as recorded in Matthew 24, is an
example.
   2. This was the costliest anointing oil known. It was made
from an Indian plant, and sold throughout the Roman Empire at
fabulous prices. It was a common thing to anoint the heads of
rabbis, and special guests at marriage feasts, with fragrant oil, but
this surpassed anything in that line then known. Her great sacri-
fice revealed the depth of Mary's love for her Master. Reckoning
according to the standard of that day, this was more than £10, or
about $50.

   " Desire of Ages'," chapter 63; " Spirit of Prophecy," vol. 2,
chapter 33.
                              NOTES.
    1. Bethphage, the " House of Figs," was situated on the Mount
of Olives, near Bethany.
    2. Christ's entry into Jerusalem, at the Feast of Tabernacles,
had been made secretly, and on foot. This time He will go in
riding on an ass, the ancient symbol of Jewish royalty, even as
David and the judges of. Israel had done before Him. In contrast
to the horse, introduced by Solomon for war purposes, the ass was
an emblem of peace. As the Prince of Peace, the Saviour of men
approached the city of the great King for the last time, only to
find the hearts of its rulers steeled against Him. He knew, too,
that the act would hasten His death, yet He must fulfil what was
written concerning Him.
    3. Spreading their own garments under Christ was the initial
act of proclaiming Him King. Doubtless they thought the long-
expected Messianic reign was about to open.
8                        LIFE OF CHRIST.


    4. Josephus estimates the number usually present in Jerusalem
at a Passover, to be about 3,000,000, more than two-thirds of the
entire population of Judea and Galilee. The city could not con-
tain them. All the environs,—even the slopes of Mt. Olivet itself,
which looked toward the city,—were covered with the booths of
the pilgrims. " Much people " were indeed present. Everything
was favorable for the greatest demonstration toward making Christ
the long-expected King.
    5. So Christ was in the midst of admirers, actually permitting
 Himself to be proclaimed King. He accepted the title, and
received the homage, a thing He never did before. The hopes of
 His followers were greatly raised, and they shouted with Unwonted
vigor, while chanting that part of the "great Hallel" which they
had been so long accustomed to repeat when partaking of the
 Passover lamb, the symbol of the Messiah.
    6. Inasmuch as the prophet had said that these words would be
repeated at just such a time, they must be heard, even though the
stones of earth cry out, because the Word of God can not be
 broken. What He says is sure to come to pass, even though it
 must be done in the most improbable way. '
    7. Jesus knew full well how soon the -homage being bestowed
 on Him would pass away. As the fading sunlight broke over the
 city, the thought of what it might be, in contrast with what it
 would be because of His rejection, overcame Him, and He groaned
 aloud. Had Jerusalem but owned Him, she might have been the
 queen of all cities, because of 'the honor He would have bestowed
 on her.
    8. How little the people realized the meaning of those sorrowful
 words. A generation later the Roman army was encamped on the
 very spot from whence these words were uttered, and it laid in
 ashes all the splendor of the city as it appeared on the day of
 Christ's triumphal entry there10.

3, chapters 1 and 2.
                               NOTES.

    t. Jesus knew before reaching the tree that it bore ho figs. But
its outward appearance, by having leaves in advance of other
trees, proclaimed that it did have fruit on, although the time of figs
was not yet come. The tree had a designed purpose,—that of
bearing fruit. By not doing so, it transgressed the law of its being
while presenting a boastful and deceitful show of superiority over
its neighbor trees. By this it had forfeited its place in creation,
and so by the word which produced it, the penalty of removal was
pronounced. This fitly represented the Jews of that day, as well as
professed Christians of to-day, who claim to have more light and
truth than others. God had borne with the Jews many years, but
as in the parable in Luke 13 : 6-9, the time was present when it was
proper to say, " Cut it down." So it will be with all who do not
meet the design of their being.
    2. Three years before, at the beginning of His ministry, Christ
had done the same thing, but apparently with little lasting effect,
for the same abuse had been restored. Had the first cleansing
been regarded, the fig tree would have borne fruit, and no place
would have been found for the second cleansing. But before being
put to death, Christ had a public work to do in the very court of
the temple, in order to confirm before all the people His Messiah-
ship, and as He could not do this in the midst of wicked desecra-
tion, this cleansing was first necessary.
    3. For hours Christ held the court of the temple unchallenged
for healing purposes. He had wrought many miracles in Jerusa-

lem before, but never so publicly, and within the temple itself.
What a change from the earthly traffic of the day, to the healing of
the afflicted, and the precious teaching of the world's Redeemer.
Why may we not have the same change in the temple of our bodies?




  LESSON IV.—THE QUESTION OF AUTHORITY.

                            October 28, 1899.


           In the Temple at Jerusalem, A. D. 31.
           (Matt. 21: 23-46; Mark 11 : 27 to 12: 12; Luke 20: I-19.)

2,an again to teach, what question was asked Him
by the priests, scribes, and elders? Matt. 21 :23.
See note I.
    2. What reply did Jesus make to the question?               John I: 19-27;
                                                                  Mark I/ 29, 30.

                              NOTES.
    i. Of these three classes the highest council of the Jews was
composed. They were constituted the keepers of the temple, the
only public building left by the Romans entirel.y under Jewish con-
trol. They believed their rights to have been invaded by one who
was neither priest nor Levite, scribe nor elder, and who had taken
possession of the temple as though it were His own. During the
absence of Jesus since the evening before, there had evidently
been a council of the Sanhedrim (Mark II: 18), and their plans
had been definitely marked out, but, as will be seen, they failed
to execute them.
    2. While the authorities had never acknowledged John's mis-
sion, they had never openly condemned him ; indeed they did not
                         LIFE OF CHRIST.                         13

need to, because they saw from John's course that Herod would
put him out of the way. So they were willing to have it under-
stood that they participated in the popular sentiment. Had they
acknowledged John's mission as heaven-born, they would have
had no excuse for rejecting Christ, whose forerunner he was.
They could, on the present occasion, have told what they believed
about John, but dared not do so before the throng of people
listening to the controversy. Christ's answer to their question
was wholly unexpected by them, and they were completely dis-
comfited.
    3. This was to compare them most unfavorably with the lowest
people of that day,—those whom the Jews themselves affected to
despise. It was tearing aside their vail of hypocrisy in the pres-
ence of those whose leaders they were, and whose good opinion
they coveted. But the Saviour was not yet done with thpm; He
would yet reveal what they, in their hearts, purposed to do to Him.
    4. By reference to Luke 20 :.9, it will be seen that this parable
was directed to the people, in order that they might render judg-
ment against the priests, whom they would see had been lead-
ing them astray. It must have been they, therefore, who gave the
decision as recorded by Matthew; for Luke goes on to say (20 : 16),
that when the decision was spoken, those who heard it said, " God
forbid." This exclamation of the priests was probably uttered
 because they thought that the parable was spoken against them,
 and they could not consent to the conclusion reached.
    5. This was a quotation from Psalms 118, which was familiar to
 the Jews, as referring to the Messiah. It was also a part of the
 "great Hallel," which had been shouted by the people two days
 before, while waving the palm branches, also that which the chil-
 dren had sung in the temple immediately after its cleansing.

    6. What did the king then do to provide                     Acts 13:46;

thus appearing at the wedding, what order did the

chapter 3.
                               NOTES.
    i. The early part of the parable refers to the Jews scorning the
Saviour, and suffering the loss of their city in consequence. The
latter part clearly shows the Gentiles being brought into the plan
of salvation, and traces the whole through the closing scenes of
earth and the judgment.
    2. From Rev. 19 : 8, it is clear that the royal wedding garment
is the righteousness, which the Lord provides every one whom He
calls to the wedding. All can have it who will. So, then, if any
neglect or refuse this gift on the conditions offered, and still per-
sist in attending the wedding, as a guest, without the wedding
garment, he will have no excuse.
    3. In their secret council, they concluded not only to set spies
on Christ's track, but to engage the Herodians in the task of over-
throwing Him, in order to give their work less of a Pharisaic
character. The latter stood on the principles of Jewish theocracy,
 drawing their inspiration from • Deut. 17 :15. To this scripture
 they appealed when Rome took possession of the throne of Judea.
 The Herods were of Idumean extraction, though having inter-
 married with the Jews to some extent. The Herodians were
 believers in the right of the Herods to the throne. But when
 these were taken away, and Pilate, a purely Roman governor; was
                           LIFE OF CHRIST..

installed in their place, the Herodians felt free to unite with the
Pharisees in demanding the rights of the Jews. Yet even in this
they were inconsistent, since it was Roman power alone that had
kept the Herods on the throne. They, however, agreed to assist
in trapping Christ in some unlawful statement concerning the
political situation.

cees had been silenced, what did they do? V. 34.
     9. With what question did one of them, who

    10. What did Christ say was the first great com-

        Was this statement in harmony with the         Luke 10 : z6, 27.

                              NOTES.

   t. It will be seen that the scripture quoted by the Sadducees
had nothing to do with the conclusion they drew; so that theirs
was a hasty and ill-advised deduction. They probably supposed
that such conclusion naturally followed the command which they
quoted from the Pentateuch, but it was not so ; hence the Saviour's
rebuke of their lack of knowledge, both of Scripture and the
power of God.
   2. Christ might easily have proved the resurrection from Job,
Isaiah, David, and other prophets, but He chose to meet this
question with the words of Moses, the only inspired writer that the
Sadducees believed in. It was useless to cite authorities for them
in which they had no faith, a lesson worth remembering in our day.

   3. These two principles being eternal, and the whole law hang-
ing on them, or being drawn out, from them, must be just as eternal
as that on which it hangs, or depends, for support.

                              NOTE.
   Mark says that after the public silencing of the Pharisees, "the
common people heard Him gladly." They were then prepared to
hear dark revelations concerning their former leaders. After they
had perceived the hypocrisy of the men in high places, there was
no longer any danger of their turning against their Lord. On the
other hand, their attitude would deter the officials from laying
violent hands on Christ until He had fully brought out their char-
acter in its true light. His words of condemnation on this occa-
sion were most scathing ; yet they were those of gentleness ; to the
Pharisees, however, they were but the voice of volumed terror.
Never were more terrible denunciations uttered than were heaped
on those Pharisees. Yet this was done without any commingling
of sinful passion, or of revengeful malice. His words were those
of the Eternal Judge, which all who shall be found at last in the
same class, will hear concerning themselves.
20                             LIFE OF CHRIST.


    How different the words of this last day's message in the
temple, from the teaching, of the Saviour on the mount of blessing.
The words of blessing were uttered on a mountain-side of Galilee ;
the words of woe were pronounced in the courts of the Lord's
house. But it can not be that these woes were •uttered simply be-
cause those men were sinners. There must have been something
with them more terrible than mere acts of evil ; for to the woman
taken in adultery the Saviour kindly said : " Neither do I condemn
thee ; go and sin no more." But to the haughty Pharisees at
whose table Christ sat, He spoke altogether differently. These
woes were directed against those who cherished hidden sins, —
corruption of heart,—while they outwardly posed as God's serv-
ants. Hypocrisy must therefore be one of the most hideous,
nauseating sins in God's sight, especially where its influence is
used to lead souls to perdition.
    The Gospel is therefore like the cloudy-fiery pillar,—a glowing
light to the faithful, but a lowering gloom to the faithless ; to some
it speaks tenderness, to others terror; to some it is all blessing, to
 others it proves a curse.

    t. The woes had been pronounced in the outer court of the
temple. The Lord, having done His duty in this line, calmly
retired to the court of the women, the innermost point to which
they were admitted, and there sat down opposite the treasury.
This consisted of thirteen large chests, with openings shaped like
the bell of a trumpet, to receive the free-will offerings of the
people.
    2. These offerings were for the priests and poor people. It
made no difference to this woman in the warmth of her loving
zeal, that she was poorer than some for whom a portion of the
money was intended. Besides, she did not positively know just
what disposition the priests would make of her offering. She
simply answered a call of duty, and left results with Him who
seeth and knoweth all things.
    3. Jesus was to die, so• that He might, like the planted wheat,
bring forth a product like Himself. If these Greeks would see
Him, and be like Him, let them bear in mind His work, and
follow Him in it, and then they would have assurance of eternal
life; otherwise they would abide alone in their knowledge of Him.
This lesson is for all to-day.
    4. Although Satan was compassing the death of Christ in order
to destroy the "Seed of Abraham," and so make God's Word of
no effect (Rom. 9 : 6), yet the death of the " Seed " would prove
not only its restoration, but the multiplication of it. Gal. 3: 29.
Like the kernel of wheat, if He die, instead of abiding alone, He
would cause the "seed of Abraham" to abound everywhere, by
drawing all to Himself.

     " Desire of Ages," chapter 69.
                              NOTES.

   1. Three questions were asked, involving the destruction of
the temple at Jerusalem, which the disciples believed would stand
until the end of all things, the sign of Christ's second coming,
and the end of the age. Christ took up first in His answer the
great event around which all others cluster—His second coming
to earth—and treated that in a general, way. He then spoke of
the destruction of the temple as the beginning of a series of events
which are to terminate in His coming.
   2. That is, men would proclaim themselves the Anointed, and
by certain signs and wonders, lead many to accept their statements
for truth. See Matt.. z4 : 24. This has ever been a favorite method
employed by Satan to mislead honest souls.

                               NOTES.
    1.These days of persecution were predicted to be 126o years in
duration. Dan. 7 : 25. But, as foretold in the text, these days were
shortened, lest all of God's people should be destroyed. In the
 providence of God various causes operated to stop the general
 persecution of God's people prior to the close of the 126o years
which began in 538 A. D. and ended in 1798. The enlightenment
of Europe through the powerful influence of the Reformation
resulted in a public sentiment which would not allow such persecu-
tions as had been prevalent, and edicts of toleration were issued
by ruling monarchs of Europe about 1775-76. Since the latter
date there has been no general persecution. The student should
note the exactness of the prophecy. In Matthew the record says,
" Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be
darkened, and the moon shall not give her light." In Mark it
says, "In those days, after that tribulation." The darkening of
the sun and moon, May 18, 1780, occurred "immediately after the
tribulation of those days," and these events came " in those days
after that tribulation." Any darkening of the sun and moon
occurring on any date not included between 1776 and 1798 could
not be the signs foretold by our Saviour.
    2. " No man maketh known" is the sense of the text. Several
translations render the text in this way. We have a parallel in
  Cor. 2 : 2, where Paul says, " I determined not to know," that is,
                        LIFE OF CHRIS1.                                 27

I determined not to make known. The day and hour Of Christ's
coming will not be made known by man, angels, nor by the Son,
but by the Father only. And certainly no man can make known
the time till it is made known by the Father. As He has not
revealed the time in the Scriptures, we know it has not yet been
revealed.

    15. What words of commendation were spoken

cuse his fault? Verses 24, 25.
    17. How did the lord meet his excuse? Verses

    18. What sentence was then passed upon him?
Verses 28-30.
                                NOTE.
   The parable of the ten virgins met its fulfilment in the expe-
rience of God's people in 1844, when the great advent movement
reached its climax. This included a period of six months, ending
with October 22, 1844. The midnight cry was given, commencing
in July of that year and continued till October 22. See " Life of
William Miller," " Life Sketches," and " Last Day Tokens."
   The talents in this parable represent the gifts which God be-
stows upon His people to use for Him. They include all temporal
and spiritual blessings, and they are given "to every man accord-
ing to his several ability." Verse 15. That is according to his
ability to use them. See Eph. 4 : 8-16 ; r Corinthians 12. While
the principles taught in this parable have always applied to the
experience of God's people, they will be understood better, and
be applied more closely in the last days, after the giving of the
signs. Like the parable of the ten virgins, it is placed chronolog-
ically in connection with Christ's teaching in regard to His second
coming and the judgment.

    i. The sheep is used in the Scriptures as an emblem of meek-
ness, patience, and submission, and thus typifies the qualities of
the Lord Himself. Isa. 53 : 7 ; Acts 8 : 32. He was a Lamb slain
from the foundation of the world. Rev. 13 :8. He is also the
Chief Shepherd (I Peter 5 : 4), who calleth His sheep by name, and
they follow Him. John to : 4, tr.
    2. A brief study of the side texts following questions 5 and 6
will show what importance the Scriptures attach to what is known
as Christian Help Work. One may not be aware that he has done
much toward relieving distress, or those to whom he has minis-
tered may not appreciate that which was done for them ; but
Christ saw in the labor put forth, the reflection of His own life,
and counted it as done for Him, ,and to represent His generous work
in the earth. Therefore, the sincere desire to do something in this
line, followed by conscientious effort, is marked in heaven, and
weighs greatly on the right side of every account examined in the
judgment ; because the disposition to do such work shows a one-
ness with Christ, which entitles the holder to a place with Him.
We are not to conclude from this that we obtain salvation and
righteousness by our good works. We are saved not because we
do, but we do because we are saved.

                             READING.
   " Desire of Ages," chapter 71 ; "Spirit of Prophecy," vol. 3,
chapter 6.
                              NOTES.
   i. Evidently some thought that the disappearance of Christ
from the Passover would raise questions of His whereabouts that
could not be satisfactorily answered. Suspicions would then be
whispered about that the elders had put Christ to death secretly,
which would forever destroy their power over the people, because
such an act would be evidence to all that nothing but malicious
hate on the part of the authorities had been the cause of His death.
Therefore, to save their reputation with the• people it was neces-
sary to trump up some charge by which His death might be com-
passed with a show of legality, and in a public manner. Thus the
odium of His death, if any should exist, would be made to rest
on the civil power.
   2. How great must have been Judas' hardness of heart in order,
afterward, to look the Saviour in the face, and call Him Master, in
common with the other disciples. He either never had faith in
the Lord's infinite power of discernment, or had permitted him-
self to be drawn into the darkest condition of mind possible.

ii  STORY
Or A BOOK
                 By A READER
                    and OBSERVER

       AVING had more than or-
         dinary opportunities of
         watching the prepara-
 tion and placing of books on
 the market, I have thought a
 brief account of the same would
 interest and possibly profit my
 fellow book-lovers, hence this
 sketch.
    The subject is a MS which
 has been over ten years in prep-
 aration, and which is the very
 chief of the author's numerous
 works. When completed it
 was placed in the hands of the
 Pacific Press Publishing Com-
 pany, of Oakland, California,
 who at once recognized it as a
 masterpiece. As their exami-
 nation grew more thorough,
 they realized what wonderful
 scope its beautiful and touch-
 ing story would give the expert
 illustrator, and, desiring an ap-
 propriate setting for the riches
 of its text, they began to give
 the matter of illustrations care-
 ful study. In this they were so
                fortunate as to secure the services of Mr. W. A.
                Reaser, a very prominent American artist, who
                also acted as their Art Director. He associated
                with himself such men as Messrs. Mente,
                Pogarthy, Perard, Mora and Bardwell, and to-
                gether they studied the MSS. that they might,
                by the use of fine illustrations, emphasize its
                most important parts. This illuminative work
                                            occupied nearly two
                                            years, and cost about
                                            $6,000.
                                              Then followed the
                                            typesetting and
                                            printing, which was
                                            performed by the
                                            most skilful work-
                                            men the publishers
                                            had in their employ.
                                              The selection of an
                                            appropriate title was
                                            left with the pub-
                                            lishers, who sought
                                            the advice of a num-
                                            ber of experts in
 'It was                                    books and book prep-
placed in the
hands of the    aration. The title finally selected was fur-
Pacific
Press           nished by Mr. E. M. Morrison, a well-known
Publishing      general agent. It was "THE DESIRE OR AGES,"
Company"
                and was suggested to him by reading Haggai
                2:7, where Christ is referred to as "the Desire
                of all nations."
                  After the printing had been done, and the
                sheets folded into signatures of 16 pages each,
                they were passed on to the bindery. These
                signatures were then gathered into complete
                books and sewed on tapes, which is the usual
                way of sewing office ledgers and other books
                requiring extra strong bindings.
                  The covers, or "cases" as they are called
        in a book bindery, were next
        made, and the illuminated titles
        stamped upon them in the em-
        bossing machine. Then, after
        trimming, rounding, backing,
        and several other minor proc-
        esses, the sewed books were
        fitted and glued into the covers,
        carefully pressed, examined and
        wrapped for shipment.
           All this, of course, took time,
        and the advance orders had
        commenced to come in with the
        result that on day of publica-
        tion, Nov. 1, 1898, orders to the                  "Then
                                                           followed
        value of 414,967.25 had been received. It was      the type-
        impossible to prepare books with the requisite     setting"

        rapidity to promptly fill this unprecedented de-
        mand, although every effort was made to do so.
           Before this time, the Review and Herald
        Publishing Company, of Battle Creek, Michi-
        gan, had purchased a set of plates, and later
        the Echo Publishing Company, of Melbourne,
        Australia, also ordered a set, from which each
        publisher prints for its regu;ar trade.
           I might state in explanation of the above




"And printing which was performed by
the most skilful workmen"
                statement that large books are not usually
                printed direct from type, but from electrotype
                plates. These plates are thin copper-faced
                metallic casts of the type pages, the manu-
                                     facture of which is a trade
                                     in itself. These thin casts
                                     are then mounted on wood,
                                     when they are ready to be
                                     placed on the press. An
                                     unlimited number of elec-
                                     trotype plates may be
                                     made from the original
                                     page of type.


 `The sheets
                                       A TRADE EDITION
folded into
signatures of      Although the subscription edition which has
  b pages       just been described was entirely satisfactory
each"
                for the library and the home, it was too expen-
                sive for some classes of would-be purchasers.
                One lady said to me, "I can get along without
                the fine bindings and illustrations, but I can
                not get along with-
                out the fine reading."
                This was emphasized
                by many others, and
                as the publishers de-
                sired to place it with-
                in the reach of every
                one, they decided to
                issue a thin-paper                                    "Were then
                edition without illustrations, size 5 x7 inches.      gathered
                                                                      into com-
                   The type on this edition was set on a type-        plete books,
                                                                      and sewed
                setting machine called the Linotype, which is         on tapes"
                operated something like a typewriter, and which
                does the work of four or five men, making at the
                same time a metal cast of each line of type, from
                which electrotype plates are taken.
                   Plates for this edition, also, have been ordered
                by the Review and Herald Publishing Company,
and it is expected that
books will be ready for
delivery by both houses
in October. The prices,
I understand, are $1.50
for the cloth binding, and
$2.00 for the leather. The
publishers are certainly to
be congratulated on pro-
ducing so large a book—it
will contain more •than a
thousand pages—at so low
a price. They do not an-
ticipate that this edition
will in any sense take the                          "The
                                                    Illuminated

them, and those unable to purchase the better
book.
  I could not close this account of the mechan-
ical preparation of the book without at least
referring to its contents. In brief, my opinion
                       is that there is no book
                       outside the Bible that
                       contains the rich instruc-
                       tion, the divine encour-
                       agement, and the soul

Political Speeches and Debates
           Edited by ALONZO T. JONES
This book contains the public speeches
and debates of Abraham Lincoln and
Stephen A. Douglas from 1854 to 1861,
also Lincoln's great speech at Gettysburg
and his second Inaugural Address.
The principles over which these giants
of the political arena contended are
again manifesting themselves, hence it
is important that we become intelligent
concerning them, and this volume will
greatly aid to that end. Then again,
the speeches of Lincoln were always to
the point, and afford good examples of
effective use of the English language,
and are well worthy of study on that
account alone. It contains 555 pages,
and the regular price in cloth is $1.75.
