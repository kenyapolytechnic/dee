LIFE OF CHRIST
                    For Senior Classes.

                   NOTE TO THE STUDENT.
   IN  the study of these lessons, let it be remembered that the
Biblical account of this part of the life of Christ on earth is very
fragmentary. Since God has not seen fit to give in the Bible the
exact chronological order of events in the life of Christ, we may
well believe that this is not of the highest importance. What we
need most of all in the study of the Master's earth life is to see
in His every word and act the manifestation' of Jehovah's ever-
lasting love for an erring and lost race, and to be so drawn toward
Him, by beholding Him, that we may be brought to the likeness of .
Him who first created man in. His own, image. Then let specula-
tive thought give way, in every case, and on every occasion, to an
earnest desire fully to know the Lord, which is eternal life. To
this end let every student devote much prayerful study to the
lessons, that they may prove the source of a rich experience in
the daily life.

THE SURPLUS DONATIONS dining the present quarter will be used M the
   most needy foreign fields.

    1. The news of John's death had doubtless to do with suggest-
ing the proposed rest. It was to Christ the warning that His
labors in Galilee must also soon terminate through the people's
rejection of Him, and the shadow of His own violent death as
well. There were many things to communicate to His apostles
which could not well be said before the multitude. Besides, they
needed a spot for quiet meditation and prayer. The Bethsaida, or
Fish-house, here mentioned as the place of retirement, is supposed
to have been a place six miles from Capernaum, at the head of the
Sea of Galilee, east of Jordan, sometimes called Julias, in honor
of Julia, a daughter of Emperor Augustus. It was beyond the
to ritory of Herod Antipas, and in the tetrarchy of Philip, there-
fore entirely distinct from the place by that name west of the Sea
of Galilee.
    2. Formerly the Jews had but three watches of the night,
enumerated as the first, or "beginning of the watches (Lam. 2 : 19),
the middle watch (Judges 7 :19), and the morning watch" (Ex.
14 : 24 ; I Sam. is : II). These were respectively from sunset to ro
P. M., from ro P. M. to 2 A. M., and from 2 A. M. to sunrise.. At this
time; however, they had mostly given up their owri computation of
ti.-t night watches, and adopted that of the Romans,, namely, four
 watches, from 6 P. M. to 6 A. M., and known as even, midnight,
 cock-crowing, and morning. _Mark 13 : 35. The " fourth" watch
 must, therefore,, have been between 3 and 6 o'clock in the
 morning.

   I. the Jews were very scrupulous about washing their hands
before and after eating. To neglect or slight this ordinance was
counted one of the three great sins which brought poverty. It
was even counted the same as adultery.
   2. The divine law commands honor to be bestowed on parents
without regard to age or circumstances. Even the Talmud of old
had enjoined that "a child is bound to maintain his parents when
old and helpless, even if he have to beg to do so." But in the
days of Christ; the rabbis had established the niaxith that the diity
to honor God before honoring human relationship was para-
mount; hence the tradition that a child dedicating himself or
money to the temple was free froin all obligations to parents.
   3. This was Christ's first denunciation of the party of the Phari-
sees. Their hatred of Him from that time was greatly intensified
until they eOrlif)aSSed His death. they could not challenge His
loyalty to God's law; for He had held that aloft as the standard by

is plain that the Saviour did not mean to convey the idea that one
could take everything, of whatever nature, into the stomach, and
not receive harm; for the very Word upon which all His appeals
were based, teaches it to be wrong to drink intoxicating fluids.
Hab. 2 :15; Prov. 23: 29-32. The same Word also pronounces a
blessing upon that people whose rulers " eat in due season for
strength, and not for drunkenness." Eccl. to : 17.
    5. The plants not planted by God are those of human tra-
dition and man-made commandments. Those things are no
better in the church now than they were then. But it seems
almost as hard now to keep free from these as it was for the peo-
ple of that day.
    6. This journey led the Master and the twelve northward and
westward toward the sea-coast. This region was thickly settled
with Jews drawn thither by commerce. For ages the population
had been half heathen and half Jewish. See Judges I : 32.
    7. Syro-Phenician—evidently meaning a mixed race growing
out of Phenicia, having been attached to the Roman province of
Syria.
    8. Dogs were so troublesome in the East, and became such a
dislike, that fierce and cruel enemies were called dogs. Ps.
22 : 16, zo. All uncircumcised persons were called dogs by the
Jews.

    z. Decapolis means "ten cities." Nine of these lay east of the
Jordan, and one on the west. The country round about these
cities was therefore called Decapolis. From Matt. 4 : 23-25 and
Mark 7: 31 it would appear that this general appellation was given
to quite a large district extending along both sides of the Jordan.
According to Pliny, it was confined to the eastern side of the river,
and extended from Damascus on the north to the brook Jabbok
on the south. This was a region particularly disliked by the Jews,
because ten cities therein located, had municipal governments
distinct from Jewish interference—though in Palestine—and had
joined together in a political alliance against all Israel. They
afterward perished by fire and sword, and the entire region, once
so densely populated, is said to be now almost without inhabitants.
    2. This reveals how impossible it was for the Son of God to be
hid. The popular excitement, however, only served to make His
enemies hate Him the more, because the people were pot only
enjoying the rich blessings of His spiritual teaching, but were also
experiencing the power of Heaven in healing their maladies, which
was a foretaste of the kingdom of God restored.
    3. Mark says this was done to tempt Him. The word " tempt "
as here used means to try, or prove. It appears that they were not
satisfied with His past demonstrations of infinite power, and would
have others to gratify their own curiosity. Christ, however, would
throw away no miracles on these agnostics. They would not have
believed had their request been granted, It is evident that the
two parties united on this occasion for a mischievous purpose.
    4. Strange that they should so soon forget that Christ Himself
 was living bread, and that those who possessed Him could never

hunger. John 6 :33, 36. His reminder of the two miracles, when
food was created for the multitude, was to impress the thought that
where He is there can be no lack, because He is living bread, and
that His spoken Word can, when necessary, take material form,
and become a nourishing substance for the body.
   5. It must be remembered that Christ was a fugitive from the
malice of His enemies, and so the less publicity given to His acts
and words the safer He would be, until the hour should come for
Him to be delivered up. Luke 22 : 53.

    I. The town bearing this name -lajito'the northeast of the plain
of El Huleh. It was close to the territory of Dan, and nearly due
east from Tyre. The town had been formerly known as Baal-Gad,
so named from the Caananite god of fortune. It was rebuilt by the
tetrarch Philip, three, years before the birth of Christ, and named
Cwsarea,      honorcif Augugius, thereigning emperor ; hence its
name. It was called Panium by Josephus, but is 'now known as
Banias.
   2. It is upon the rock of this revelation that the church of Christ
is built. When guided by the Spirit of God, His represent-
atives will do and speak as .led by that power, and so their
loosing and binding is sanctioned in heaven. See side texts
When Peter said by the Spirit to the larrie man at the gate of the
temple, " Rise up and walk," the result was the same as though
the words were uttered direct from heaven.
   3. Only three were permitted to see this wonderful sight—those
who constituted the innermost circle of the Lord's followers. The
same trio were the only ones admitted into the death chamber of
the little maid (Luke 8:51), and were also the exclusive compan-
ions of the Lord during His passion in the garden. Just why this
was we do not fully know, but one thing is taught by the example
—that, while the Lord's work recognizes no favorites, in a low
sense, there are some whom he .permits to enter deeper into the
mysteries of His doings than others. This being so, all should
trust God's wisdom and justice, and know that God reigns over
His work and people in the earth.
    4. The very fact that Peter included Elias (Elijah) in the num-
ber to dwell in one of the three tabernacles he suggested to have
made, shows that 'he still believed that that prophet was yet to
come and live with the Messiah on the earth forever. He, there-
fore, could not understand the statement that Christ was to die
and be raised again. This only illustrates how tenaciously one
clings to his old, preconceived ideas, in spite of the plain teaching
of the Word of God.

                              NOTES.
   1. The disciples were evidently still clinging to the idea that
the Saviour's kingdom was to be an earthly, tangible one, with
His throne in Jerusalem, and that at the proper time He would
there assume the reins of government. So on the journey
toward Capernaum, and in anticipation of an early trip to Jerusa-
lem, they fell to discussing the question of their relative fitness
for positions of trust in the new commonwealth. This material
view of the Lord's kingdom so barred the door of their hearts
that the spiritual truths their Master wished to impress upon them
could not find entrance.
16                       LIFE • OF CHRIST.

    2. French suggests thaV" tribute " in this text is an unfortunate
rendering, inasmuch as it supposes a civil tax. The rate asked of
Peter was the didrachma, or the half shekel of Ex. 3o : 11-16,
which was required of every Israelite above twenty years old, for
the current expenses of the tabernacle, and afterwards the
temple. It was a piece of silver, in value about thirty-two cents,
or one shilling and fourpence of English money.
    3. Strangers being those only who were subject to tribute, the
temple could not exact means from Him who was the Son of God,
the great King, to whose temple service the money was to be
applied. Priests and prophets were exempt from this tax. But
the Son of God in that instance gives a beautiful example of waiv-
ing personal rights, in order to prevent wrong impressions, which
would produce unnecessary friction. The money necessary to
meet the demand was not on His person, but was to be found in
the mouth of a fish. The stater, thus miraculously produced, was
just enough to pay the needed amount not only for Christ, but also
for Peter, His follower, who likewise was counted a resident of
Capernaum.
    4. The word from which comes "offense" means cause, occa-
sion of wrong, or an inducement to sin.
    5. Ancient kings shut themselves away from the gaze of men,
but their counselors were privileged to behold their faces. See
side text. The angels are thus said to behold the face of God,
which is hidden from mortals. Ex. 33 : 20. These same angels
being ministering spirits to the humble saints (Heb. I : 14), the
latter have counsel with God through their ministering spirits, and
so are the subject of heavenly counsel, regarding their difficulties
and dangers.
    6. "As an heathen." While a man may be regarded as a
heathen, or a publican, and so unfit for church-fellowship, yet the
Spirit of Christ teaches us to labor earnestly for the conversion of
all such. This can not be accomplished by harsh treatment, or
hateful words, or by abandonment. The only way to win any one,
in whatever state or condition, is by kindness.
    7. "Ten thousand talents," an expression conveying the idea
of a hopelessly large debt. Literally it would be about $8,000,000.

The smaller debt was about $15. The instruction in this
chapter grew out of the dispute of the disciples as to who
should be the greatest in the new kingdom which their early Jew-
ish teachings had pictured as constituting their Master's prospec-
tive dominion. They had not yet learned that "the kingdom of
God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy
in the Holy Ghost." Rom. 14 : 17.

                               NOTES.

    r. These " brethren " were probably the relatives from Naza-
reth, who had called at Capernaum on their way to the feast at
Jerusalem, hoping to have Jesus there join their caravan. Having
not yet declared themselves on His behalf, they desired Him to
accompany them to the feast, and there, at the Jewish metropolis,
demonstrate His claims to the Messiahship. They did not believe
it the part of wisdom for Him to remain in the remote parts of
Galilee, if He expected to establish the Messianic kingdom.
They urged that He should go where the world at large could see
and know Him.

   2. It would not do to journey to the feast amid a crowd, as
such a course might precipitate a popular movement against Him,
and prematurely-destroy His life. He would wait for a quiet
discussion concerning Him to settle personal convictions with
each, before showing Himself openly.
   3. The closing expression of verse 19 makes it evident that
the question of the Jews in verse 15 was one intended to excite
doubt and suspicion in the popular mind against Christ and His
teaching. It is also evident from the further answer of Christ that
they had even charged Him with being a violator of the law, by
referring to His healing a man on the Sabbath day at the Passover
a few months earlier. See chap. 5:1-9. The Feast of Tabernacles
was at the end of September or early in October, while the Pass-
over came the last of March, or the first of April.
    4. It is a remarkable fact that the Jews have never attempted
to deny the reality of the miracles which Jesus wrought. All they
can say is that He did the work by the power of Beelzebub.

                              NOTES.
   1. The word " door " is here used in the sense of means of en-
trance, just as faith was made a door unto the Gentiles. Acts
iq : 27. Christ is the door to the sheep-fold, through whom all
must enter. Heb. 7 : 25. He Himself, as leader and care-taker of
the sheep, must go before the sheep, and prepare the way, by faith.
Those who follow must have His faith, the faith of Jesus. To all
such the door opens just as readily as for the One who prepared
the way.

   2. The adjective " good," in verse xi, is from the, word kalos,
meaning beautiful, pleasing. Christ is therefore a beautiful; pleas-
ing, and therefore an attractive shepherd, one who gives, joy to
those who follow Him. He draws them after Him by-His pleas-
ing gentleness. Ps. 18:35; John 12 : 32.

     " Desire of Ages, chapters 53, 54.
                              NOTES.
    I. The feast of tabernacles came late in the autumn, after the
ingathering of the harvest, in the seventh month. Lev. 23 : 34.
The feast of the dedication to commemorate the piirging of the
temple, and the rebuilding of the altar, after Judas Maccabeus had
driven out the Syrians in B. c. 164, was held in the ninth month.
As Jesus desired to be present at the latter (John Jo : 22, 23), He
did not return to Galilee, but spent the intervening time in Judea.
His time was getting very short, and as little labor had been
bestowed upon Judea during His ministry, He therefore organized
the large force of seventy disciples to go before Him to the various
towns as heralds of His approach. In this way, the people would
be prepared for His coming, and much more could be accom-
 plished in the short time left for His earthly ministry. This is a
significant fact, and• one that should influence our actions, the
 nearer the end draws on.
                         LIFE OF CHRIST.                             23

   2. It will be noticed that after telling the seventy how to conduct
themselves upon entering a house, and receiving its benefits, the
Lord laid obligations upon them to return a blessing upon the
household. This was on the principle that in caring for the
Lord's messengers, the people were entertaining the Lord
Himself (Matt. 25 : 40), which act could not fail of its reward
(Matt. xo : 40-42).
    3. The statement of the fall of Satan, or the adversary, was to
remind the disciples that the Lord's conquering power had
already vanquished their enemy, and that they should not be
elated as though their ability had accomplished the work. The
only thing for any to rejoice in is that the Lord has elevated them
from the depths of sin, to have their name registered among the
family of heaven.
    4. Bethany, the home of Martha and Mary, was situated on the
east side of the Mount of Olives, about fifteen stadia, or nearly
two miles, from Jerusalem. It is said to have been, in the days of
Christ, a beautiful, retired spot, amid green fields, hidden among
the surrounding heights. It is now a wretched, ruinous village, of
not more than a score of families, existing under the name of
 El-Azarieh or Lazarieh.

   " Desire of Ages," chapter 44.
                               NOTES.
   1. The words of this warning are evidence that the Jews were
maliciously trying publicly to cover up theirbetter sentiments con-
cerning Christ. The evidence of His Messiahship was ample for
                           LIFE'OF

even the dullest mind, and for this reason the Lord said that even
the heathen would rise up in the last day to condemn their words.
In this way their covered feelings would be revealed, and what
they had talked in 'confidence to close friends would be openly
proclaimed. How much better to ever stand on principle, even
though obliged to stand alone, than to smother sacred convictions
for the sake of popularity!
    2. The root from whenee "`sparrow," of this text comes, is one
which means " chirp " or "twitter," hence a small chirping bird,
as the rock sparrow, said to'be common in Palestine. They were
secured by being knocked down by sticks in the hands of hunters.
Brought to market,' five of these were sold for the smallest piece of
bronze money, known as lepton, equal in value to about one-eighth
of a cent.
    3. The word "fool" occurs frequently in the New Testament.
In some places the original means thoughtless, as in Luke 24 : 25;
in others, a rebel, as in Matt. 23 : 17, 19. In this text it carries the
sense of a heedless person.

     " Desire of Ages," chapters 56, 57.
                               NOTES.
     1. This feast occurred in December. It was celebrated by
                          LIFE OF CHRIST.                           27

daily reading of prayers and singing the " Hallel,"—" Praise
Ye Jehovah." Josephus says that the festival was also called
" Lights."
   z. There seemed but one retreat left for the persecuted Son of
God. He had been rejected in Galilee, and now in Judea His hte
was threatened. But His life was yet to be extended. Jerusalem
was the only place where fanatical zeal abounded enough to put to
death such a being (Luke 13 : 34). So Jesus retired temporarily
to the half-heathen country of Perea, east of the Jordan.
   3. Moses had said that on certain considerations, divorce was
lawful. The rabbis had so construed the Hebrew word used by
Moses to convey the cause for divorce, as to make it cover the
most frivolous excuse. The whole thing, however, seems to be
summed up in this: If one saw any other woman which pleased
him more than his wife, the excuse for divorce was an easy matter.
In the eagerness of the Pharisees to tempt Christ, and to entangle
Him in His talk, they pressed the matter upon Him. But the
Lord's answer was discreet and silencing, and they failed in their
object. It seems that, having determined on the death of Christ,
and desiring to shield themselves before the people from the charge
of putting Him to death, the question was put at that time, and in
the studied form it was, that it might involve Christ in the difficulty
which caused the death of John the Baptist. Herod Antipas, in
whose dominion Christ was then staying, was a noted adulterer,
and if Christ could be drawn into a position which would be a
condemnation of Herod's course, that ruler might be induced to
put the hated Nazarene out of the way.
    4. Christ told the disciples, in substance, that all men could not
receive their idea of the question. There were some, indeed, who
must live single lives by circumstances of birth, or constitution; and
some because of the mutilation endured through the cruel practises
of bond-masters. Others there were of this class who, by special
vow, had withdrawn themselves from society for the kingdom of
heaven's sake. These were not better than others, but simply
different.' The marriage institution was created by Christ in Eden
for a wise purpose, and must still be necessary, even though sin
has overspread the world. 1 Cor. 7 : 2.

chapter 31.
                              NOTES.
   1. Lazarus probably died about the time Jesus received the
message bearing the news of his dangerous condition. Remaining
in His place two days, and then occupying two days more by slow
journey to Bethany, He found the funeral obsequies past, and the
mourning ceremony in operation. To appear there after the death
of Lazarus and raise him from the tomb, would be more evidence
of Christ's Messiahship than to heal him from his sickness, because
the Jews attributed such work to malign influences alone.
   2. Dean Alford considers it evident from the peculiar construe-
30                        LIPt p CORTST.

tion of the original text that this question was an adverse criticism
of the Lord's apparent helplessness, His tears were to them a
mark of His lack of,. power to help the situation. The healing of
the blind man (chapter 9) to them was surely a fraud, for had
Jesus power to heal sone so beloved, He certainly would npt have
delayed so long His appearance in Bethany.
    3. Already, in the quiet of His own heart, Jesus had communed
with God, and knew that His prayer regarding Lazarus was
answered. In His audible prayer, therefore, He simply thanked
the Father for hearing, that others might be benefited and the
name of God glorified by what was to follow.
    4. In effect Caiaphas said: "Ypu have not considered that it is
expedient for you, in view of your interests as priests and rabbis,
that this one man should die, to save Israel from the certain
destruction that threatens it, if you would let Him stir' up a
Messianic revolt ; for in that case the whole nation would perish.
The Romans will come with their legions, and close our temple,
annul our independence by abolishing our laws, and waste us with
fire and sword."—Geikie's Life of Christ, vol. 2,15. 31,6.

    1. The evidence is strong that the invitation for Jesus to dine
at the place was planned specially for the purpoSe of entrapping
Him in some way. Although knowing this, and that eminent
spies,—rabbis and Pharisees,—would be present, Jesus did not
hesitate to accept the invitation. Before the company reclined to
eat, Jesus saw a poor afflicted man enter the house, according to
oriental license, when He put the main question of the occasion.
    2. The couches on which the orientals reclined at meals were
placed on three sides of the square from which the food was to be
eaten. The other side was left open as a passage for the servants
to bring on dishes, and serve food. The couch at the right was
reserved for the most honored guest. This was counted the
" chief place." The next couch was for the second in rank, and
so on. At such occasions as the one under consideration, the
rabbis schemed to secure the best position, sometimes even to
offending the host.

   " Desire of Ages," chapter 61.
                               NOTES.
   1. It seems strange at this distance that, after so much and
such recent instruction concerning the part Jesus was to act, the
disciples should still cling to their traditional dream of an earthly
Messianic kingdom. But theirs is a case of religious teaching in
which the whole life becomes so moulded as to prove almost hope-
lessly fixed. Inasmuch as human nature is the same in every age,
how important that parents see to it that their children are now
diligently taught in the principles of eternal truth!
    2. This case shows that the general sentiment of the great
masses is not always correct. Had these two forlorn rnen obeyed
36                       LIFE OF CHRIST.

the public demand, they would have remained in their sad plight.
But the acute sense of their needs, and their intense desire for help,
that they knew could be had from no other source, impelled them
to disregard the popular demand. So it is now ; in order to be
healed from spiritual blindness, one must definitely and resolutely
appeal to the Lord, despite the general demand for quiet.
    3. The publicans were tax collectors. This man, being "chief
among the publicans," was probably the superintendent of cus-
toms, or tribute, for the district of Jericho. These tax collectors
were famous for being extortioners in their business, and it is not
strange, therefore, that this Jew (for such his name implies) was
" rich."
    4. The course Zaccheus marked out for himself was the best of
evidence that his heart had undergone a great change. The same
principle still holds good, that he who claims to love the Lord,
and knowingly withholds from others that which he has wrong-
fully taken from them, has not had that radical change of heart
necessary to enjoy the comfort of the Holy Spirit.

         A FRESH
         NEW STOCK



                                    PE la IS
        During the past two years there has been issued an almost
    q)ddiess variety of Bibles, bound in split-leather, sheepskin,
    cloth, etc., and described as "Morocco" bindings.
         In comparing the descriptions of these bindings with those
    listed in our Catalog, some people have thought our prices
    high when they were really very low.
         Now, to avoid all misunderstanding, we are issuing a new
    Bible Catalog which tells, just as tar as we can learn, the quality
    of leather used in each style of binding.
        That this Catalog may represent the best Bibles on the
    market to-day, it is largely devoted to the newest editions
    published; the most of our older stock having been disposed of
    at a sacrifice to make room for that which is better.
       The net prices of the publishers are strictly adhered 10.
       This Catalog is free.

R Watchman on the Wall
R Pioneer in the Wilderness
    As the watchman is placed to descry the approach of
friend or foe, and proclaim what he sees to those within the.
walls, so the Signs of the Times stands to warn the dwell-
ers of earth of the approach of the hastening day of the Lord,
terrible for the careless and unready, full of hope and ever-
lasting joy for the faithf trl ones awaiting the return of their
Master.
    As the pioneer goes forth into the untrodden wilderness,
clears away obstructions and makes a path for the on follow-
ing of his fellowmen in the march of Progress, so the Signs
of the Times goes forth into the wilderness of the world's
errors, and with its sharp cleaver cuts away the tangled
undergrowth and overgrowth and lets in heaven's bright
beams of light upon a pathway prepared for its fellow work-
ers, the Bible reader, the minister, the missionary in any
branch of the Master's service.
    "I know of dozens of cases where people have become
interested and have come into the truth by reading the SIGNS.
I have seen over a dozen the fruits of my labor,—not I, but
the Lord gets the credit. May the Lord send out more reapers,
for the harvest is ripe,"—so says one of our old workers.
    How does it go? By means of its friends. It has many,
it wants more. Are you befriending it, and thus working
with. God, whose servants are all? Canvassers are needed,
donations are needed for supplying reading matter to needy
individuals and fields. Will you help?
    A volume of 832 pages, with sev :ral special issues during
the year, each beautifully illustrated, for one dollar. Price of
the paper six months 50 cents, three months 25 cents.

      Representative Opinion
            We quote the following from a letter recently re-
        ceived from the Secretary of the Pennsylvania Tract
        Society concerning the "Desire of Ages," as it gives in
        a few words the almost universal opinion of those who
        have read the book:




     May the Lord continue to
bless in the work there and every
means used-to introduce this
wonderful book. There never was
a book published by Seventh-day
Adventists that equals it. It is
the power of the gospel, and
every soul that reads its pages
must be lifted higher and higher
in the plane of holy living.
   Yours for the cause of truth,




         Good active agents will find this a truly "wonderful
       book" to introduce to the people, and one that will do
       a vast amount of good. Complete canvassing outfit,
       post-paid, $1.25. Descriptive circular sent free.
