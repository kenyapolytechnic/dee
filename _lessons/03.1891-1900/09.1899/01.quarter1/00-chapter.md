 LIFE OF CHRIST
                    For Senior Classes

             FIRST QUARTER, 1 *39 S).


                       INTRODUCTION.
    SINCE the days of Abraham, the promises of God to men have
been confined to the "Seed of Abraham." The record tells us
that the promises were not to the seeds—or natural descendants
of Abraham—but to, and through, one Seed, who is Christ. Gal.
3: 16, 29. While in the fleshly line Christ was to be counted as the
"seed" of Abraham, in His divinity He was before Abraham
(John 8:58), and was therefOre his Lord and Saviour, the same
as He is (Mrs. But the fact that Christ was to be born in the flesh
of Abraham's seed, and so to become possessor of the " promised
land," made it necessary for Him to be born in that land, from
whence was to flow to all nations the promised blessings to Abra-
ham's seed. Gal. 3 : 7-9, 13, 14-
    The scenes of the life of Christ are therefore confined to the
land of " Canaan," also termed Palestine. Allowing these names
to apply to the entire territory covered by the twelve tribes of
Israel, it embraces a sort of parallelogram of country with an area
of nearly 12,000 square miles, or a territory about the size of
Massachusetts and Connecticut combined. If, however, we con-
 fine Palestine to the country between the Mediterranean Sea and
the Jordan River, between Mount Lebanon on the north, and the
 desert on the south, as is often done, we contract it to about 6,600
                                                    (3)

square miles in dimensions, or to a territory smaller than the state
of Massachusetts by 1,20o square miles.
    In this narrow compass of territory was the earthly work of
Christ accomplished. To become familiar with each locality of
this limited region ought not to be a large task, yet even this will
require considerable patient research. But this should not be the
principal object in studying the life of Christ. Every student of
His life should study Christ Himself,—His character, His quiet
demeanor, His methods of labor for the uplifting of humanity,
and His bearing under the stroke of persecution. In this way
alone can the Student of the following lessons hope to be benefited.
    Study well the side texts in conjunction with the lessons.
Study them at home all through the week, and the life of Christ
will shine with new luster in your minds. They may not all of
them seem to have direct bearing on the subject, but they will be
found very helpful to all who desire to dig for hid treasures. The
plan of placing these texts in the margin is a new one, which we
trust will prove satisfactory and useful to students. Another new
 departure in this number of the LESSON QUARTERLY is the publi-
 cation of a map of the country and places mentioned in the lesson
scripture. We believe this feature will give added value to the
 QUARTERLY, and be greatly appreciated by our schools.



    THE SURPLUS DONATIONS during the present quarter will
be used in the most needy fields. We are informed by the presi-
dent of the Foreign Mission Board that India, Japan, and Africa
will need most of our donations during 189g. Therefore these
fields may be studied by our people.

    "Desire of Ages," pp. 43, 44.
                              NOTES.
    1. Inasmuch as Christ was to•be manifested to the world as the
"promised Seed" of Abraham (Gal. 3 : 16), it was absolutely
necessary, in giving an account of His life, for the evangelists first
to trace His ancestry on the fleshly side, back to Abraham, and so
establish His identity as the Messiah. Matthew, therefore, begins
with Abraham, and follows the genealogy down through David to
Joseph, the reputed father of Christ. Matt. I: 1-16. By this he
attempts to prove that Jesus is the heir of the everlasting covenant
made with Abraham, and renewed to David. Gen. 17 : 7; 2 Sam.
7 : 12-17; Isa. 9: 6, 7. To this end he shows that Jesus stood in
such family relations to Joseph as to have claim to all that belonged
to him as the lineal descendant of Abraham. Luke, however,
presents the ancestral line of Mary, inverting the order followed
by Matthew, and tracing her lineage from Heli, her father, back
through David and Abraham, to Adam, who was the son of God.
 Luke 3: 23-38. This record says that Christ was the "supposed "
son of Joseph, but He was, in reality, the son, that is, the maternal
grandson, of Heli, the son of Matthat, etc. It will be noticed that
 both genealogies unite in Abraham, making it doubly sure that
 Christ was the promised " Seed " of that patriarch.
    2. It seems that a divorce was easily obtained at that time.
 The form of such a bill among the Jews was called " Gett," and
 was written upon parchment by a Jewish notary, in the presence
 of one or more of the rabbis, and was to contain no more than
 twelve lines. It was not supposed to state the reason or reasons
 why the separation was decreed, but simply to say that the woman
 was discharged from all obligation to her former connection, and
 was free to marry whomsoever she pleased.

   3. The word " taxed " in the text comes from a word meaning
to register or enrol, In such registrations it was necessary for
each person to report for enrolment in the ancestral town. Joseph
and Mary being both 'lineal descendants of David, they must
repair to the "city of David" to be enrolled, according to the
decree of the Roman emperor, whose subjects they were.
   4. " And so it was " that Christ was born in Bethlehem of
Judea, in fulfilment of the prophecy, when His mother was a
resident of Nazareth in Galilee. This is but one of many exam-
ples of how decrees of nations or kings have been steps to the
fulfilment of prophetic utterances. Not that God made kings
issue such decrees, but He, seeing the " end from the beginning,"
could fully state beforehand the results of these mandates.

                              NOTE.
   There were two reasons why the parents of Jesus took Him to
Jerusalem at this time. The Mosaic law required an offering of
every mother, at the end of her days of purification. When she
was in circumstances to permit it, this was to consist of a lamb of
                         LIFE OF CHRIST.                             9

the first year for a burnt-offering, and a young pigeon or a turtle-
dove for a sin-offering. But when parents were too poor to pro-
vide a lamb, the law was satisfied with simply a pair of turtle-doves,
or two young pigeons. The fact that Christ's parents offered only
the latter shows that they were in the deepest poverty. Again,
the law required that a first-born son should be redeemed by a
fixed sum, and this requirement must be fulfilled by the parents of
our Lord, since He was Mary's first-born.

                               NOTES.
    T. " The epithet by which Matthew describes to us these Eastern
strangers is not so vague and indefinite as it seems in our transla-
tion. He calls them Magi from the East. The birthplace and
natural home of the magian worship was in Persia. And there
the Magi had a place and power such as the Chaldeans had in
Babylon, the Hierophants in Egypt, the Druids in Gaul, and the
Brahmins still have in India. They formed a tribe or caste,
priestly in office, princely in rank. They were the depositaries of
                        LIFE OF CHRIST.                         /I

nearly all the knowledge or science existing in the country where
they lived. . . . The education of royalty was in their hands ;
they filled all the chief offices of state ; they constituted the
supreme counsel of the realm. As originally applied to this
Median priest-caste, the term Magi was one of dignity and
honor."—Hanna's Life of Christ,
    Suetonius, Tacitus, and Josephus each tell of a strong belief
among the people of the East that one born in Judea was to arise
and rule the world. This may have been propagated by stranger
Jews, from their prophecies, and taken strong hold of those who
desired a spiritual leader. See "Desire of Ages," p. 59.
     2. It seems strange that the first intimation of the Messiah's
advent receiv0 by those who professed to look for Him as their
King, must be given through strangers from a far country, who
professed entirely another faith. It is not so strange that they
were troubled when the thought was forced upon them that they
had so neglected the Word concerning the time and the place of
the Saviour's advent, that God would not give them additional
means of such knowledge, but sought repositories of that truth
among the Gentiles. Thus God has ever done, and will still do
by those who become careless in the truth already committed
to them.
     3. Although the priests had become so absorbed in worldly
matters as to lose sight of the time of the Messiah's advent, they
quickly turned to their neglected prophecies, and established the
birthfilace of their long-heralded King.       '
     4. Herod sought from the wise men information as to how long
since the star was first seen by them, evidently with the purpose
in view which he soon carried out. His edict to slay the children
of Bethlehem covered all under two years of age, " according to
the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men."
Matt. 2: 16. It had probably been quite a long time since they
 first observed the strange star, and had studied its significance.
     5. God could, by a miracle, have preserved Christ from Herod's
 malice without His having been removed from Judea. But in all
 His dealings in behalf of men, their co-operation is sought, that
 they may have responsibility, and consequent interest in what is
12                        LIFE OF CHRIST.

being done for them. The parents of Jesus were therefore com-
missioned to have a care for the infant Saviour. The journey
taken was about sixty miles southward from Bethlehem.
   6. That the prophecy "might be fulfilled." The prophecy had
said, " When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called My
Son out of Egypt." Hosea It : I. " Israel " means a firince of
God. As the Son of God, Christ was, and is, the " Prince of
God " in the fullest sense. As the " Seed " of Abraham, He was
a child; and as the great Antitype of Israel, must go into Egypt,
and be again called forth to live temporarily in the promised land,
as did Abraham and his children in the flesh. Nothing was omit-
ted from the life of Christ which would tend to associate Him
with the house of Abraham, and prove Him to be the promised
" Seed " through whom the promises were to come to Israel.

     " Desire of Ages," pp. 66-96.
                               NOTES.
   1. Some have placed the death of Herod the Great in A. D. 2.
That would make the sojourn of the Saviour in Egypt six years.
This hardly seems probable. In a foot-note on page 54 of Hanna's
" Life of Christ," he says : " It has been accurately ascertained that
Herod must have died between the 13th of March and the 4th of
April 75o A. U. C. [after the building of the city, i. e., of Rome]."
" Hale's Chronology," vol. I, pp. 85, 96, gives strong arguments in
favor of that date. This would set the date of Herod's death in
the early part of B. C. 4, and would make the stay in Egypt cover
but the period of a few weeks at most.
    2. It was natural for the parents of Christ to turn, on this occa-
sion, to Mary's old home among the hills of Galilee. Surrounded
by prominent elevations, the little village of Nazareth was practi-
cally shut away from the world. The place was so insignificant
historically that no mention of it occurs in the Old Testament.
Even a Galilean felt justified in asking, " Can there any good
thing come out of Nazareth? " John 1 :46; 21 : 2. It was seventy
miles north of Jerusalem, and six west of Mount Tabor.
    3. The word " Nazarene" was a term of contempt. The name
Nazarene was derived from the Hebrew netser, meaning sprout,
or shoot, and suggested insignificance. " The name is prophet-
ically given to the Messiah (Isa. I' • 1)          `There shall come
forth a shoot from the stock of Jesse, and a twig from his roots
shall bear fruit.' As David sprang from the humble family of
Jesse, so the Messiah, the second David, shall arise out of great
humiliation. The fact that Jesus grew up at Nazareth was suffi-
cient reason for His being despised. He was not a lofty branch on
the summit of a stately tree ; not a recognized and honored son of
the royal house of David, now fallen, but an insignificant sprout
from the roots of Jesse ; a Nazarene, of an upstart sprout-town."
—Vincent.
   " Whenever men spoke of Jesus as the Nazarene, they either
consciously or unconsciously pronounced one of the names of the
                         LIFE OF CHRIST.                         15

predicted Messiah, a name indicative both of His royal descent and
His humble condition."--Smith.
    4. " The child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with
wisdom." This is the record of the first twelve years of Christ's
life. It tells much in general, but nothing in detail. Beyond the
veil of the child's gentle, sunny home life of obedience, we may
not obtrude vain curiosity.
    5. According to Jewish reckoning, the age of twelve was the
time when a boy passed from childhood to youth, and took the
name of " son of the Lord." At that age he was supposed to
begin attendance at the annual feasts. At that point also he was
given over to the school of the rabbis, when destined for the
priest's office, in order to begin the instruction necessary to fit
himself for that position. See " Desire of Ages," p. 75.
    6. What a night of anxiety must have attended Joseph and
Mary ! The Lord's charge to them had, after twelve long years of
constant watching, been neglected, and now they were bereft of
the child's society. A whole day had been passed in visiting,
without their realizing that He was not in their company. Another
day was consumed in retracing the journey to Jerusalem, and at
least one more in a fruitless search through the city, and among
those with whom they had associated during the feast. At last on
the third day He was found in an outer part of the temple used as
a school-room, where the rabbis taught youths the system of
rabbinism. See " Desire of Ages," p. 78.
    7. Knowing that the full time for His public ministry to begin
had not yet come, Jesus became subject to His parents for eighteen
years longer, doing absolutely nothing to betray His divinity, but
living so naturally at home that even His brethren in all those
years discerned in Him no mark of His calling. John 7 : 5. So
little was He known that Nathanael, living but a few miles away,
in Cana, had never heard of Him until Philip pointed Him out as
the Messiah. John I : 45. What a lesson of cheerful, gentle
patience ! This was truly emptying self. In our daily life, let us
look to Jesus of Nazareth for a pattern, as well as to the suffering
of the cross,

   1. " At hand;" that is, has come nigh. This was the herald of
an expected leader to take them forth from their wanderings in the
wilderness of sin. See note 6 of lesson 3. Those to whom the
Baptist preached were like their prototypes of old, while in
Egypt,—outside of God's kingdom, in the service of another
king. Therefore the message to them in the wilderness was to be
ready to sustain the better administration which was at hand, and
so enter the kingdom of heaven.
   2. At this time the Roman emperor claimed and exercised the
right to appoint and depose the Jewish high priests, as he chose.
All who served in this office must please the emperor. Annas,
though a sagacious and purchasable man, was not able to hold the
office undisturbed. Appointed by Cyrenius, imperial governor of
Syria, in A. D. 7 (Luke 2 : 2), he was obliged to resign at the begin-
ning of the reign of Tiberius Csar, A. D. 14. He managed,
however, to secure the office in turn for five of his sons, and for

his son-in-law, Caiaphas, with whom he managed to be associated
up to and beyond the time of the crucifixion of Christ. Acts
4 : 6. See " Desire of Ages," p. 3o.
    3. Publicans—those holding public office, chiefly tax-gatherers.
Doing this work under appointment of, and in the interest of,
the Roman Government, this class was odious and despised in the
eyes of their countrymen, not only as traitors, but extortioners of
large profits out of the national degradation. They received, like
all the others, an answer just suited to their needs.

    I. Bethabara was beyond the Jordan, that is, on the east bank
of that river, supposed to have been nearly opposite Jericho. It is
not positively identified. See "Smith's Bible Dictionary."
    2. This was characteristic of the Saviour through all His work.
His modesty on this occasion is a standing model for every pro-
fessed Christian. As He was retiring and modest, in this first
public act of His life, so may all become the same, and demon-
strate their worthiness to be counted His followers.
    3. Never before had such an answer to prayer been realized.
The form taken by the Holy Spirit on this occasion is certainly
suggestive. It was in the beautiful form and gentle motion of the
dove, the appropriate symbol of gentleness and affection. It
identified Him as the meek and lowly One, the kind and loving
Saviour. That Spirit is the same to-day, and when received,

to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality,
and without hypocrisy." James 3: 17.

   " Desire of Ages," pp. 114-131.
                            NOTES.
    1. Every movement of Christ was controlled by the Spirit, of
which He was "full." John r :16. He was conceived of the
 Holy Spirit. Luke I : 35. The Spirit was not given to Him by
measure. John 3 : 34. The Holy Spirit was the source of His
 power. Acts 16: 38. Through this He was spotless. Heb. 9 : 14.
 By the same He gave directions to His apostles concerning their
 work, after His resurrection. Acts 1 : 2.
    2. The object must have been twofold: (I) He must undergo
 temptation in its most direct and potent way, in order that He
'might reach the depth of human suffering in that line, and so
 know how to sympathize with those whom He came to save.
 (2) These days were also to serve for Him as a season of medita-
 tion and preparation for the great work before Him. It was also
 to be a season of triumph, not only over Satan in his direct
 attacks, but also a triumph over the flesh, by absorbing, elevating
 communion with God—a lesson for all who have been intrusted
 with responsibilities in the work of salvation.
     3. He was probably so absorbed by His devotions in the face
 of a persistent enemy, that He did not feel the need of food. It
  will be noticed that both Mark and Luke imply that the Saviour
  was being tempted at every stage of the forty days' fast. It may
  be that during that time the question was being revolved, from
22                       LIFE OF CHRIST.

His human side, as to whether He was really having God's pro-
tection, while being left in so desolate a place. This is suggested
by the attack of Satan after Christ became sensible to hunger.
    4. Forty days before, at His baptism, a voice from heaven had
said, "Thou art My beloved Son." Now, in the solitude of the
wilderness, with only wild beasts for companions, pale and emaci-
ated from a long fast, with the pangs of hunger gnawing at His
vitals, will His faith rest on that Word spoken to Him a few days
before? Satan seizes the opportunity to insinuate a doubt of the
truthfulness of that statement, hoping thereby to cause a failure of
the plan of salvation. To doubt would be to disprove His Son-
ship. If this plan does not carry, Christ may attempt to prove His
Sonship by obeying the dictates of Satan, and so take Himself out
of the keeping power of God. He feels quite sure that on one or
the other of these lines Christ will fail. See " Desire of Ages,"
p. n9.
    5. Satan virtually said to Christ: Now You have assumed to
depend on God's Word for support and protection, let me, and all
these worshipers in the court below, see God care for You, when
You cast Yourself out into space; then all will believe You are the
Messiah. Has not God said, He shall give His angels charge
over You, to bear You up in their hands, to preserve You from
being dashed against the stones? Now trust this part of the Word,
if You depend so much on it.
    6. Christ does not in this case attempt to argue the matter.
That would be to step down on a level with His tormentor. He
quietly said, " Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God." It is
one thing to trust Him while doing His will, another to try Him
while presumptuously taking a course He has not prescribed.
God- can rescue me from this position, and I still trust Him.
    7. These words, spoken by way of command to Satan, when he
openly revealed himself, gave him the evidence he pretended to
be disinterestedly seeking for. In them was manifested the power
which he feigned to doubt was with Christ. The effect of their
power was quickly felt by Satan, and he slunk away without
another attack upon the Son of God. See " Desire of Ages,"
p. 130.

                                 NOTES.

   1. But the question was not asked for lack of other thoughts.
The two inquirers wanted more than a passing word with the
newly-found Being, and so desired to spend time with Him in the
privacy of His home. He, divining their wish, readily opened the
way for an extended interview.
   2. The place to which they went was some home which had
been opened to Christ for a few days' sojourn, by the hospitality
of strangers. How strangely the mission of Christ opened. He
did not make any demonstration; no public harangues were given
by Him. But as He quietly walked before the people, His first dis-
ciples were drawn to Him by the quiet words of another.
   3. " Messiah " means anointed, and was used with reference to
                         LIFE OF CHRIST.                         25

any one anointed with the holy oil. Christ was the antitype of all
those Hebrew anointings, and was therefore the " consolation " to
which every true Israelite looked forward. Luke 2: 25. The
word " consolation " there used comes from the same original as
" Comforter " in John 14 : 6; 15 : 26, etc., and means a calling
alongside for help. In other words, the Jewish consolation con-
sisted in calling to their very side the help which their blood-
offerings typified.
    4. " Jona " in Hebrew means a dove. As though Jesus had
ever known Simon, He called him the " son of a dove," and then
with divine foresight as to the developments of Peter's future,
added, " Thou shalt be called Cephas," that is, a stone. It will be
noticed that this change of name for the impulsive apostle was
bestowed at the very first meeting of Peter with his Lord, and
before any other words had passed between them. The name
" Peter," by which this disciple is most commonly known, is the
Aramaic and Greek equivalents of Cephas, or stone.
    5. "Under the fig tree." The chosen place for meditation and
prayer with the devout of Israel. Philip had been in devotion
under the fig tree, pondering over the very truths he had heard at
Bethabara, when list-ming to the words of the Baptist, and wonder-
ing, like many others, when and where the Messiah would appear.
He came to Christ doubting, but with a guileless heart. Christ's
words to him seemed so full of divine prescience that he could not
help believing that One was before him who knew his very
thoughts. He was by this deeply impressed that the desire of his
heart had become the sight of his eyes, and his doubt gave way to
the sincerest faith. It has been supposed by some that, inasmuch
as the name Nathanael does not appear in the list of the twelve
apostles, he was identical with Bartholomew, who is always named
next to Philip.
   These five were Christ's first disciples. He called but one of
them direct; two were prompted to unite their interests to His by
the words of John; one of them joined the company at the instance
of a brother; and the other, by the solicitation of a friend. It was
all done by direct, individual work, the efforts which God blesses
 above all others to the salvation of men.

                              NOTES.

   1. Cana, "the reedy place," so called from the thick jungles
originally found in its immediate neighborhood, was situated on a
hill which rises from the plain of El Battauf. It is supposed to
have been nine miles north of Nazareth, the home of Jesus, which
was the first objective point of the journey. Arriving there, and
finding no one to receive them, Jesus and His disciples accepted
an invitation to be present at the wedding, which from attending
circumstances seems to have been that of some relative of Christ,
judging from the prominent part His mother was acting in
connection with it.
   2. Fresh juice of the grape was considered indispensable at a
Jewish wedding, while the fermented variety was forbidden. Prov.
20 : I. See also " Desire of Ages," pp. 145, 149. It is not known
how long the festivities had been going on before the wine gave
out, but such a failure was a disgrace to those making a feast, and
so the extremity on that occasion was one to be deplored.
   3. He no longer calls her " mother," but uses a familiar
Hebrew expression, the common form of address to all women.
He wishes her to understand that she no longer controls Him, but
that He is under the sole guidance of His Father above. Her
interference in His work, on the ground of her fleshly relationship,
was repudiated. There was danger of her forgetting His changed
28                      LIFE OF CHRIST.

relation to her. While the address now seems harsh, it was not
then so considered, as will be seen by His last tender words to
her, when he was expiring on the cross. John 19 : 26. See
" Desire of Ages," p. 146.
   4. The hour is not Mine in which to be glorified; the time has
not yet come for Me to be exalted. God fixes My hour and work;
I must now glorify Him alone. See " Desire of Ages," pp.
146, 147.
   5. The sanitary precautions of the Old Testament had been so
distorted by the Jews of that day that before every meal each per-
son must wash his hands. No one came from the market and
neglected the prescribed ablution. Every guest must have his feet
washed upon arrival, and leave his sandals outside of the door.
For these purposes, and countless other washings, great stone jars
were by the doorway. At this place there were six of these, each
holding about ten gallons. This is the lowest estimate of their
capacity made by any author. To fill all these with wine showed
overflowing generosity, which is characteristic of the Lord in
answering our requests for spiritual blessings.
   6. This was a great miracle. As said by Milton, " The con-
scious water saw its God and blushed." The difference between
this miracle and the regular operation of nature was only in the
matter of time taken to obtain the result. In the operation, one is
as much a miracle as the other, since it requires the power of God
to accomplish the result in either case. The miracle did not break
the order of nature's laws, but only hastened it.
    7. Without doubt, as the guests remarked on the quality of the
wine set before them, inquiries were raised as to where it was pro-
cured. The servants, of course, related the whole proceeding.
Jesus was then sought for. Anticipating this, in His great modesty
He retired, and this act on His part gave opportunity for His dis-
ciples to proclaim Him as the Son of God,--the Messiah. Quickly
the news of the event spread until it reached even Judea, and so
Christ sought retirement for a few days.

                               NOTES.
    T. The Jews recognized two forms of the Passover. The first
was observed in the wilderness, on the journey from Egypt to
Palestine, and for some time later. After the building of the
temple, however, the form of celebration was materially changed.
By comparing Deut. 16: 1-6 and Num. 28: 16-25 with Exodus,
chapters 12, 13, it will be seen that injunctions regarding it were
added in the later scriptures which were not in the former, and
which were hardly possible to be carried out in the wilderness.
In the later observances of the ordinances wine was used, but it
was not enjoined in the Pentateuch. It is, however, mentioned in
the New Testament. Luke 22 : 17-20; I Cor. ro : 16. The song
with which the Saviour closed the last Passover service was not
required by the original instructions. The song, called the Hallel,
was comprised of Psalms 113-118, the first two being sung at the
beginning of the meal, and the others at the close.
    2. This was the first cleansing of the temple, in the early part of
Christ's ministry. The cleansing of the temple was repeated at
the last Passover which He attended, three years later.
    3. At each Passover every male, whether rich or poor, must
bring his half shekel to the sanctuary, as a sacred tribute to be
 applied to the expenses of the tabernacle service. Ex. 30 :11-16.
 But the money of the various countries, of b G ss~Qr copper, bearing
 heathen symbols and inscriptions, was not                 the temple.
 The worshipers coming from these countries were obliged to
 exchange their heathen coin for the usual silver piece of the sanc-
 tuary, and these money-changers did this service for them, charg-
 ing a heavy rate per cent for the favor. This caused much haggling
 over money values, and, with the bleating of sheep and the lowing
 of cattle, the babel of voices made the temple court a scene of
                         LIFE OP CHRIST.                                 31

much confusion. The disciples had before witnessed this profana-
tion of the house of prayer, but probably had not before stopped
to think it wrong, since this arrangement had been the custom for
many years. But seeing in Christ's act a fulfilment of prophecy,
their faith in Him was greatly strengthened. See-11-1Dcsire-of
Ages," p. 155.
    4. That is to say, Jesus received none of these into the circle of
His personal followers. No one from about Jerusalem, in fact,
was to be thus privileged. He chose no scribes, no rabbis, no
men of high standing from that region. On the other hand, His
disciples, to whom He committed Himself to the end of His life,
with the single exception of Judas, were Galileans. Knowing
what was in all men, He knew whom to choose for the successful
issue of His earthly work.

                               NOTE.

   1. The location of iEnon is not now positively known. It is
quite generally conceded to have been west of the Jordan, and
some think about eight miles south of Scythopolis. The name
itself is merely the Greek rendering of a Chaldee word which
signifies "springs." See map.

   2. About 925 B. c. Omri, the sixth king of Israel, built the city
of Samaria within the tribe of Ephraim, and named it for Shemer,
the man of whom he bought the territory. i Kings 16 : 24, 25. It
was then made the capital of the ten tribes, and the name of the
city was bestowed upon the kingdom itself.
    3. "Sychar" is nowhere mentioned in the Bible except in
John 4 : 5. It is quite generally believed to have reference to the
important city of Shechem. It lies in a sheltered valley, having
Gerizim on the south, and Ebal on the north, and is said to have
been the paradise of the Holy Land.

                                NOTES.
      1. The hot climate of that country made a drink of water of so
  much value that under ordinary circumstances no one would think
  of refusing it. But continued strife for centuries between the Jews
  and Samaritans had created a most bitter and permanent hatred
  between the two sections. In the first place, the Samaritans were
  made up of people from. Babylon, Cuthah, Ava, Hamath, and
  Sepharvaim, taken there by the king of Assyria when he carried
  the ten tribes of Israel into captivity. A few stragglers, also, from
  the ten tribes found their way back again to their native land.
  For certain reasons, the king of Assyria returned one of the exiled
  priests to that land, who taught the people the worship of Jehovah,
  which they added to their own worship of idols. 2 Kings 17 :24-33.
' When the tribe of Judah returned from its captivity, these people
  desired to join with them in building the temple at Jerusalem,
  which was refused. The Samaritans in consequence built a rival
  temple at Mount Gerizim. Eternal enmity sprang up; greater
  holiness was claimed for Mount Gerizim than for Jerusalem; the
  Samaritans accused the Jews of corrupting God's Word. On the
  other hand, the Jews called the Samaritans Cuthites, and forbade
  all intercourse with them; to receive one into the house was to
  bring down the curse of God.!
      2/Note how carefully the Saviour led the mind of the woman,
  not only to voluntarily confess her sinfulness, but to ask questions
  for the enlightenment of her darkened mind. He precipitated
  nothing, but let her open the way for the line of truth she sought
  to receive.," A worthy lesson for many now who would make
  assertions people are not prepared to receive.
      3.,C'he relations of the sexes in that day, even in common life,
  were very narrow and suspicious among the Jews. An unveiled
  woman in public was counted immodest. For a rabbi to speak to
  a woman publicly was highly indecent. The Talmud forbade it,
  even though the woman was the rabbi's own wife. He could not
  even greet her courteously1 The disciples, however, dared not
  question the act of their Master, even though the woman with
  whom He talked was a hated Samaritan sinner. He went so far
  over the bounds of prescribed custom as to conclusively show that
  true religion recognized no social difference between the sexes.
   In Christ all are one.

  OLD KING TIME
With his much-worn scythe will soon open the year 1899
for the Signs of the Times to enter upon a most im-
portant epoch in its history. The crisis of the world is
here. The issues of eternity are upon us. The last
great acts of the nations are already being outlined
above the horizon.
    The editors and contributors of the Signs of the
Times are carefully studying the situation, and are
keeping the readers of their paper fully informed and
up to date in reference to it.
    During 1899 we will add to our force of writers a
number of regular contributors of long experience in
journalism and who are watchmen faithful at their post
of duty, ready, to give the trumpet of warning the
certain sound. This feature alone will add much to
the value of the Signs during 1899.
     Five special numbers have already been planned to
come out during the year. These should not be missed
by any, and should have a wide and general circulation
outside of our regular list of readers.
    Our new premium list will be sent free on application.
Write for it if you have not seen it. Then send us an
order. If you are a subscriber, show it to your friends
and thus put to use the light God is giving through this
messenger. They will want the Signs and one of the
premiums. If you will help us in extending our circu-
lation, write also for our terms to agents.

                 for the canvassing season of 1899.
0                    Its whole object is to arouse people to the
a                fact that Christ is soon coming.
                     To prove this, the author, Elder A. 0. Tait,
                 refers to signs which may be observed daily,
Et               and which will therefore appeal to everyone                      t

        Many others might be mentioned, such as "The Nations Are
3 Angry," "Voice of the Elements," "Testimony of the Earth," etc.,

 ke signs of our times.
4       The illustrations are original, and strikingly illustrate the
    thoughts of the author.                                                1(11
           this writing (Oct. V) we can not tell how large a book it will

        At
               just when it will be ready, but we think the price will not
✓ exceed $1.50, and that it will be published early in 1899.
a       One thing we can say, however, and that is that "Heralds of the 13
    Morning" will come as near selling itself as any book we have ever
    published; because the signs of which it treats are growing daily
