   THIS is the title of a little monthly publication recently
started by the Pacific Press Publishing Co., and is designed
especially for use in personal correspondence. Each number
will contain from four to eight pages of a size convenient to go
into a number six envelope without folding. It is printed on
thin super-calendered paper, and one or two numbers can be
put in with an ordinary letter without increasing the postage.
   It is the object of the publishers to present in this Library
the leading themes of the Gospel, in a short, attractive style,
that will at once arrest the attention and create a favorable im-
pression, and a desire to read more. The themes presented
will embrace "The Love of God," "Justification by Faith,"
" Christ Our Righteousness," and kindred subjects.
   It is not intended that these tracts shall take the place of our
BIBLE STUDENTS' LIBRARY, ora/other publication, but they
are to be used by our brethren an sisters in their daily corre-
spondence. A package should be kept on hand, and when
writing to a friend, or any person, just inclose one or more of
these tracts. It will not usually add to the postage, and in
doing this work we shall be " sowing beside all waters."
   We have a membership of say 40,000. Allowing that each
person writes only one letter each week, it makes over two
million letters per year ! If each one of these letters contained
a tract, what a vast amount of good might be accomplished !
   We feel confident that our brethren and sisters everywhere
will avail themselves of this simple method of getting the truth
before the people.
   The subscription price has been placed at ten cents per year,
postpaid. Special discount when taken in quantities.
   The price of different numbers will vary according to the
number of pages they contain. It is possible that some num-
bers will contain more than eight pages, but not to exceed
sixteen.
   These tracts are published in Library style in order to secure
the pound rate of postage. The first number is now ready,
and is entitled " Looking unto Jesus." This number will be
sent to any address at the rate of 5o rents per hundred post-
paid. Sample copies free. Address,

    Analysis of the First. Epistle of John.
  It may assist to a clearer understanding of the portion of Scripture se-
lected for study during this quarter if a general view of it as a whole
can be obtained. The following analysis, taken from the "Cambridge
Bible for Schools," may prove of some help in this direction:-
Chapter 1 : 1-4.-Introduction.
    i. The subject matter of the gospel employed in the
       epistle. Chapter i :1-3. -
    2. The purpose of the epistle. Chapter 1 : 4.
Chapter 1 :5 to 2 : 28.-God Is Light.
 a. Chapter 1: 5 to 2 : 11.-What walking in the light in-
       volves; the condition and conduct of the believer.
    i. Fellowship with God and with the brethren. Chap-
       ter 1.:5-7.
    2. Consciousness and confession of sin. Chapter i :
       8-10.
    3. Obedience to God-by imitation of Christ. Chapter
       2: 1-6.
    4. Love of the brethren. Chapter 2:7-11.
 b. Chapter 2: 12-28.-What walking in the light ex-
       cludes,-the things and persons to be avoided.
    1. Threefold statement of reasons for writing. Chapter
        2 :12-14.
     2. The things to be avoided, -the world and its ways.
       Chapter 2:15-17.
     3. The persons to be avoided,-antichrists. Chapter 2:
        18-26.
     4. (Transitional) the place of safety,-Christ. Chapter
        2:27, 28.
Chapter 2 : 29 to 5 : 112.-God Is Love.
 c. Chapter 2 : 29 to 3 : 24.-The evidence of sonship,-
       deeds of righteousness before God.
    t. The children of God and the children of the devil.
       Chapter 2: 29 to 3:12.
    2. Love and hate ; life and death.. Chapter 3: 13-24.
 d. Chapter 4 : 1 to 5: 12.-The source of sonship-pos-
       session of the Spirit as shown by confession of the
       incarnation.
    1. The Spirit of truth and the spirit of error. Chapter
       4 : 1-6.
    2. Love is the mark of the children of Him who is love.
       Chapter 4: 7-21.
    3. Faith is the source of love, the victory over the world,
       and the possession of life. Chapter 5 : 1-12.
Chapter 5 : 13-21.—Conclusion.
   t. Intercessory love the fruit of faith. Chapter 5 : 13-17.
   2. The sum of the Christian's knowledge. Chapter 5:
      18-20.
   3. Final injunction. Chapter 5: 21.
   Perhaps our first impression on looking at the headings of the smaller
 sections would be that these subiects have not much connection with
one another, and that the order in which they come is more or less a
 matter of accident. This impression would be erroneous. Fellowship
 with God involves consciousness of sin, and its confession with a view
to its removal. This implies obedience to God, which finds its highest
expression in love. Love of God and of the brethren excludes love of
the world, which is passing away, as is shown by the appearance of
antichrists. He who would not pass away must abide in Christ. With
the idea of sonship, introduced by the expression "begotten of God," the
epistle takes a fresh start. This divine sonship implies mutual love
among God's children and the indwelling of Christ, to which the Spirit
testifies. The mention of the Spirit leads on to the distinction between
true and false spirits. By a rather subtle connection this once more
leads to the topic of mutual love, and to faith as the source of love, es-
pecially as shown in intercessory prayer. The whole closes with a sum-
mary of the knowledge on which the moral principles inculcated in the
epistle are based, and with a warning against idols.
   The main characteristics of this epistle, says Barnes, are these: 1. It is
full of love. The writer dwells on it; places it in a variety of attitudes;
enforces the duty of loving one another by a great variety of considera-
tions, and shows that it is essential to the very nature of religion. 2. The
epistle abounds with statements on the evidences of piety, or the char-
acteristics of true religion. . . . A large part of the epistle is occupied
with this, and there is perhaps no portion of the New Testament which
one could study to more advantage who is desirous of ascertaining
whether he himself is a true Christian. An anxious inquirer, a man
who wishes to know what true religion is, could be directed to no portion
of the New Testament where he would more readily find the instruction
that he needs, than to this portion of the writings of the aged and ex-
perienced disciple whom Jesus loved. A true Christian can find no-
where else a more clear statement of the nature of his religion, and of
the evidences of real piety, than in this epistle.
                                 NOTE.
  The portion of Scripture designated for each lesson should be so thor-
oughly studied that every question can be answered in the exact words of
the text. The questions are framed with the purpose to make this possi•
ble. It is hoped that the notes will be found suggestive and helpful in
the further development of the thought of the lesson. Teachers should
encourage a careful study of the ideas presented, and, above all, should
seek to make such a practical application of the subject matter as will
be a help in personal experience.

6             THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN.

                            NOTES.
    I. VERSES 1-4.—Christ is the Word (John : I) and the
,life (John 14 : 6), and hence he is the Word of Life. The
 life was manifested in flesh (Rom. 8 : 3), and can be known
 to us only as an experience (John i : 12). When our eyes
 have been anointed (Rev. 3 : 18 ; 2 Kings 6: 17) and our
 ears wakened (Isa. 5o : 4) so that we can hear aright (Mark
4 24), then we must testify (Acts 4 : 20), and our words will
 have effect (Acts 4 : 33). Fellowship with Christ is the ex-
 perience of every Christian (1 Cor. I : 9), and this extends
 to his sufferings (Phil. 3 : to ; I : 29), as well as to the joy
 (I Peter 4 : 13).
    2. VERSES 5-7.—God is light and dwells in light (I Tim.
6 : 16), and, as he was in Christ, (2 Cor. 5 :19), so Christ in
 his life (John I :4) was the true light (verse 9), and his fol-
 lowers become light (Eph. 5 : 8 ; Matt. 5 : 14) if they walk in
 the light (John 8:12), and are to shine (Isa. 6o :1); but this
 is done by the life (Matt. 5 : 16). "What is light?—It is
 piety, goodness, truth, mercy, love ; it is the revealing of
 the truth in the character and life." We cannot have fel-
 lowship with light and darkness at the same time. 2 Cor.
6: 14. " Sin and Jesus are never in copartnership." "The
 Lord Jesus will accept of no compromise." A lie may be
 spoken or acted, and those whose life is not in harmony
 with their profession do both. "A profession of piety is not
 enough. If religion is not brought into practical service,
 and does not produce good works, it is valueless." A Chris-
 tian "is justified by faith but judged by his works." "Only
 the love which is shown by works is counted genuine."
    3. VERSES 8, 10.—God has said that we are sinners (Rom.
3 : 23), and so we make him a liar by saying that we are not
 sinners. But while there is no good thing in us (Rom. 7 :18),
 and we are poor and miserable (Rev. 3: 17), we can boast
 of the Lord (Ps. 34 : 2 ; I Cor. 1 :31), in whom there is no
 unrighteousness (Ps. 92 : 15), and who is made righteousness
 unto us (I Cor. 1 :30). " He was condemned for our sins,
             THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN.                      7

in which he had no share, that we might be justified by his
righteousness, in which we had no share." The only way
by which we may be " Made free from sin " is to confess
that we are full of sin.
   "Are you in Christ?—Not if you do not acknowledge your-
selves erring, helpless, condemned sinners; not if you are
exalting and glorifying self. If there is any good in you, it
is wholly attributable to the mercy of a compassionate Sav-
iour." "There can be no self-exaltation, no boastful claim
to freedom from sin, on the part of those who walk in the
shadow of Calvary's cross." "And the claim to be without
sin is, in itself, evidence that he who makes this claim is far
from holy."
   4. VERSE 9.—There are some notable examples of con-
fession on record for our instruction. Daniel (Dan. 9:3-2o),
Ezra (Ezra 9 : 5 ; to : t), and David (Ps. 51 :1-4) are familiar
cases. "True confession is always of a specific character,
and acknowledges particular sins." "Confession will not
be acceptable to God without sincere repentance and ref-
ormation." "Whatever the character of your sin, confess,
it. If it is against God only, confess only to him. If you
have wronged or offended others, confess also to them, and
the blessing of the Lord will rest upon you." "Sins that
are not confessed will never be forgiven."
   "Our past sins will sometimes come to mind and cast a
shadow over our faith, so that we can see nothing but mer-
ited punishment in store for us. But at such times, while
 we feel sorrow for sins, we should look to Jesus, and be-
 lieve that he has pardoned our transgressions." " If you
 believe the promise—believe that you are forgiven and
 cleansed—God supplies the fact ; you are made whole, just
as Christ gave the paralytic power to walk when the man
 believed that he was healed. It is so if you believe it."
 But "it is not faith that claims the favor of heaven without
 complying with the conditions upon which mercy is to be
             THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN.

granted. It is presumption." "We are to believe that
God accepts us when we fulfill his conditions, simply be-
cause he has said that he would."

                             ---
                            NOTES.
   I. VERSES 1-3.—Christ came to save, not in sin, but from
sin. Matt. I : 21. He redeems from all iniquity (Titus 2:14),
and delivers from the power of evil (Col. 1:13); but God
remembers our weakness (Ps. 103:13, 14), and has adapted
              THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN.                        9

his plan of salvation to the weakest one. "The Christian
will feel the promptings of sin, but he will maintain a con-
stant warfare against it. Here is where Christ's help is
needed. Human weakness becomes united to divine
strength."
   "There are those who have known the pardoning love
of Christ, and who really desire to be children of God, yet
they realize that their character is imperfect, their life faulty,
and they are ready to doubt whether their hearts have been
renewed by the Holy Spirit. To such I would say, Do not
draw back in despair. We shall often have to bow down
and weep at the feet of Jesus because of our_ shortcomings
and mistakes ; but we are not to be discouraged. Even if
we are overcome by the enemy, we are not cast off, not for-
saken and rejected of God. No ; Christ is at the right hand
of God, who also maketh intercession for us. Said the be-
loved John, `These things write I unto you, that ye sin not.
And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father,
Jesus Christ the righteous.' And do not forget the words
of Christ, `The Father himself loveth you.' He desires to
restore you to himself, to see his own purity and holiness
reflected in you. And if you but yield yourself to him, he
that hath begun a good work in you will carry it forward to
the day of Jesus Christ. Pray more fervently, believe more
fully. As we come to distrust our own power, let us trust
the power of our Redeemer, and we shall praise hire who is
the health of our countenance,"
   We each have a case pending in the court of heaven, but
we have an Advocate there watchful of our interest (Heb. 7:
25). "He asks for his people not only pardon and justifi-
cation, full and complete, but a share in his glory and a seat
upon his throne." "The law was there [within the veil],
but it was concealed under the golden mercy seat, and its
voice was hushed by the blood of the atonement. The pro-
pitiation, or mercy seat, was there, and on it sat the glory
of God, whose anger had been turned away by the voice of
the blood."—Rodgers.
10            THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN.

  " Obedience—the service and allegiance of love—is the
true sign of discipleship," but "it is faith, and faith only,
that makes us partakers of the grace of Christ, which en-
ables us to render obedience."
  2. VERSES 4-6.-" Though John in his epistles dwells so
fully upon love, yet he does not hesitate to reveal the true
character of that class who claim to be sanctified while living
in transgression of the law of God." " God is love, and his
law is love," and so "the love of God hath been perfected,"
or fully wrought out, in the one whose life is in harmony
with his word. We are called to holiness (i Thess. 4:7),
which is agreement with God, and "the command, `Be ye
therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is
perfect,' would never have been given if every provision had
not been made whereby we could obey the requirement,—
be as perfect in our sphere as God is in his." " It is not
Christ walking upon the sea, but his ordinary walk, that we
are called upon to imitate."—Luther. Love to God (Deut.
6:5) and love to man (Lev. 19: 18) was not a "new com-
mandment" in fact, but to many it was "a new command-
ment " in experience.

conversion (t John 3:14), and no one can be in the light
(John 8: 12) and not have this love. Christ identifies him-
self with his followers, and counts every service rendered to
them as though done to him. Matt. 25:40. There are
only two classes. All are either "in the light" or " in
darkness." Love is the fruit of the Spirit (Gal. 5: 22), by
which it is shed abroad in the heart (Rom. 5: 5). When man
sinned, "selfishness took the place of love," but •" in the
heart renewed by divine grace, love is the principle of ac-
tion." God loved us when we were sinners (Rom. 5: 8), and
Christians must not limit this love to their brethren (Matt. 5:
44-46). "The Spirit of Christ's self-gacrificing love is the
spirit that pervades heaven, and is the very essence of its
bliss. This is the spirit that Christ's followers will possess,
the work that they will do."
   Christians are to love one another ( John 15: 12, 17), which
is the fulfilling of the law (Rom. 13: io). " We should love
and respect one another, notwithstanding the faults and im-
 perfections that we cannot help seeing." " We are to stand
 under the shadow of the cross of Calvary, humbling our
12            THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN.

hearts, confessing our sins, and entreating the Lord to par-
don our defects of character, and strengthen our love for the
brethren."
  It is dangerous to trifle with light, for light rejected will
bring darkness (John 12: 35), and this is the greatest dark-
ness of all (Matt. 6:23). When minds are blinded by Satan
(2 Cor. 4 : 4), the people are in the deepest darkness (Isa.
6o: 2), and do not perceive the snares of the devil.
    2. VERSES 15-17.—Our thoughts are to be above (Col. 3:
2), where our citizenship is (Phil. 3: 20, R. V.), and our love
 cannot be divided (Matt. 6: 24). Enmity between Christians
`and the world is of long standing (Gen. 3: 15), and is really
 the hope of the race. " It is the grace that Christ implants
 in the soul which creates in man enmity against Satan."
 We may be friends of God (John 15: 15), as Abraham was
 (Isa. 41:8), or friends of the world; but we cannot be both
 at the same time (James 4: 4). " Conformity to the world will
 never be the means of converting the world to Christ."
 The world passes away, but character endures. The will of
 God is his law (Rom. 2: 18), which is everlasting righteous-
 ness (Ps. 119: 172, 144; Isa. 51:6-8).

                            NOTES.
   I. VERSES 18-2o. —Apostasy is a characteristic of the last
time (or hour, R. V.). The Saviour predicted this (Matt.
24: ft, 12), and the church had been warned of it more than
once (1 Tim. 4:1; 2 Tim. 3:1-5). The incarnation is the
testing truth (2 John 7), and this really means the union of
divinity and humanity in the believer (Col. 1:27). This ex-
perience involves the death of self (Rom. 6: 6), and giving up
all things temporal (Luke 14:33), and hence many, like De-
Inas (2 Tim. 4: to), fail to endure the test. The power of
God in the church is the best agency for relieving it of un-
worthy members (Isa. 52: t), as is shown in the early church
(Acts 5: 1-14). Jesus was anointed by the Father (Acts
 ro: 38), and so are his followers (2 Cor. 2r), and they are
thus enabled to comprehend the things of God (Eph. 1:17-
19), which are spiritually discerned (1 Cor. 2:12-14
   2. VERSES 22, 23.-Christ being the image of. God (2 Cor.
4:4), one with the Father (John to: 30), through whom alone
 the Father could be known (Matt. 11:27), to see one was to
see the other (John 12:45), and a denial of one includes the
 rejection of the other (compare 2 Peter 2: I; Jude 4).

from the beginning (2 John 5), and this involves the new
birth (t John 4:7), which results in the indwelling presence
of both the Father and the Son (John 14:23). Christ. is the
life (John I1: 25), and is from eternity (Micah 5:2, margin),and
So is called the eternal life (t John 1:2), which was promised
before man fell (Titus 1:2), and announced to him before he
was driven from the Garden of Eden (Gen. 3:15). To be-
lieve on Christ is to receive him (John 1:12), who is life
(Col. 3:4), and so believers have everlasting life (John 3:36).
When God gave Christ to the world, he poured out all the
treasure of heaven in one gift (Col. 2:9), and it will he our
constant study to all eternity to learn what we have in Christ.

                           NOTES:
   I. VERSES 26 -29 --Paul warned the church of future
trouble (Acts 2o:29), and this apostasy began in his day
(2 Thess. 2:7). Jude writes very strongly concerning these
deceivers (Jude 4, 10-13), who abounded before John's death
(2 John 7). The Holy Spirit, which was promised by Christ
(John 16:7), and had been poured upon them (Acts 2:33),
would teach them the truth (John 16:13), and would protect
them from deceivers (Acts to: 19, zo). Jesus says, "Abide in
me." These words convey the idea of rest, stability, confi-
dence. See the lesson in John 15:4-7. Such a life brings
conformity to the divine character (2 Cor. 3:18) and confi-
dence at his coming (Isa. 25:9). "God is righteous. . . .
And if so, then the source of righteousness. When, there-
fore, a man doeth righteousness, we know . . . that
the source of his righteousness is God: that in consequence
he has acquired by new birth from God that righteousness
which he had not by nature. We argue from his doing
righteousness to his having been begotten of God. . . .
The whole mass of Socinian and Pelagian commentators
have reversed the members of the argument, and made it
conclude that doing righteousness is the condition, on our
part, of becoming a child of God. Roman Catholic exposi-
 tors . . . go equally wrong, in understanding bath
been begotten, not as the statement of a past abiding fact,
 but as the ground of a confidence as to the future." —Alford,
Lee & Shepard, edition 1883.
  2. VERSES I -3.-" It would require the language of the
Infinite to express the love that has made it possible for us
to be called the sons of God. Faith makes us children of
God (Gal. 3:26), and this is a present experience. The Holy
Spirit belongs to the sons of God (Gal. 4:6), who are also
heirs (Rom. 8:17) of the inheritance. In fact, "all things"
belong to them (t Cor. 3:21). The world knew not Christ
(John 1: to) nor the father (John 17:251, and for this reason
(John 16:3) will persecute true Christians (John 15:18-20).
id           THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOILAt.

This present life is the time for the perfect character. "If
you give yourself to him and accept him as your Saviour,
then, sinful as your life may have been, for his sake you are
accounted righteous. Christ's character stands in the place
of your character, and you are accepted before God just as
if you had not sinned." The character is fixed at the com-
ing of Christ (Rev. 22: 11), who "shall fashion anew the body
of our humiliation, that it may be conformed to the body of
his glory" (Phil. 3:21, R. V ), and thus shall we "appear
with him in glory" (Col. 3:4). So shall we be satisfied.
Ps. 17:15. Holiness is required of those who shall see
God (Heb. 12:14), and this privilege is promised to the pure
in heart (Matt. 5:8); but " who can say, I have made my
heart clean, I am pure from my sin?" Prov. 20:9. It is
by faith (Acts 15:9) which works (Gal. 5:6) in obedience
(r Peter 2:22) that we are purified. "He who hath this
hope in him learns from the Scriptures that he must be a
worker together with God."

  21. What character does not possess eternal life?


                           NOTES.
   I. VERSES 4-6.—Unrighteousness and sin are the same
(1 John 5: 17), and both are the result of being out of har-
mony with God's law, which is righteousness (Ps. 119: 172).
"The character of God is righteousness and truth; such is
the nature of his law." The law detects sin (Rom. 3: 20),
and drives to Christ for justification (Gal. 3:24). "A view of
our sinfulness drives us to Him who can pardon." Christ
came to take away sin and abolish death (2 Tim. 1:10), but
not the law. " Had it been possible for the law to be
changed or set aside, then Christ need not have died to save
man from the penalty of sin." "A wrong conception of the
character, the perpetuity, and obligation of the divine law,
has led to errors in the relation to conversion and sanctifi-
cation, and has resulted in lowering the standard of piety in
the church." " It is only as the law of God is restored to
its rightful position that there can be a revival of primitive
faith and godliness among his professed people; " Christ bore
the sins of the world ( John I: 29, margin) in the sinner's
place (Gal. 3: 13); and, although free from sin (I Peter 2:22),
and "hating sin with a perfect hatred, he yet gathered to his
18           THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN.

soul the sins of the whole world." "Under the mighty im-
pulse of his love, he took our place in the universe, and in-
vited the Ruler of all things to treat him as a representative
of the human family." "Though the guilt of sin was not
his, his Spirit was torn and bruised by the transgressions of
men." It was at such cost as this that "he was mani-
fested to take away our sins." That vital union with Christ
which imparts his nature (2 Peter r :4) enables us to realize
the fulfillment of " God's mighty emancipation proclama-
tion" (Rom. 6: 14).
  2. VERSES 7-9.—Righteousness must be within before it
can be manifested in outward works. " Genuine Christlike-
ness cannot be manifested in the character until Christ is
received by faith and formed within the hope of glory."
"Tice tree that bears good fruit is a good tree and has a liv-
ing root; not that the fruit makes the tree and its fruit to be
good, but it shows that they are so."—Fausset. God con-
demned sin in the flesh once (Rom. 8:3), and "the union of
divinity with humanity in Christ was to reveal to us God's
purpose to bring men into the closest connection with him-
self." "He who lays hold upon the righteousness of Christ
may become a perfect man in Christ Jesus." "The charac-
ter is revealed, not by occasional good !deeds and occa-
sional misdeeds, but by the tendency of the habitual words
and acts." Christ prayed in behalf of all his disciples that
the Father might " keep them from the evil one " (R. V.),
and that prayer avails now.
  3. VERSES 12-15.-1-4he cause assigned for the murder of
Abel is really at the root of all the injuries inflicted upon
the righteous by evil men,, and was illustrated in the death
of Christ. " It was not so much because he appeared with-
out worldly wealth, pomp, or grandeur, that the Jews were
led to reject him. They saw that he possessed power which
could more than compensate for the lack of these outward
advantages. But the purity and holiness of Christ called
forth against him the hatred of the ungodly. His life of
             THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN.                    19

self-denial and sinless devotion was a perpetual reproof to a
proud, sensual people. It was this that evoked enmity
against the Son of God." "So in all ages the wicked have
hated those who were better than themselves." " It is the
spirit that through all the ages has set up the stake and kin-
dled the burning pile for the disciples of Christ;', The
world hated Christ ( John 15: 24), and so would naturally
hate his followers. " Love is of God. The unconsecrated
heart cannot originate or produce it; it is found only in the
heart where Jesus reigns."
   Christ explained the spiritual nature of the sixth command-
ment (Matt. 5: 21, 22), showing that it is " exceeding broad."
If it were the duty of the civil power to enforce the law of
God, there would not be a sufficient number of innocent
persons to inflict the penalty upon those who are really
guilty of murder. The spirit that leads to murder is not in
harmony with the Spirit of Christ (Luke 9:56), and so shuts
its possessor out of heaven (Rom. 8: 9).

  12. How may we know that he abideth in us?


                           NOTES.
   I. VERSES 16-18.—The Revised Version renders the first
clause of verse 16 thus : "Hereby know we love, because,"
etc. The cross of Calvary is the grandest display of love
which the universe has ever seen. John 3 : 16. " Jesus died
because God loved the world. The channel had to be made
whereby the love of God should be recognized by man and
flow into the sinner's heart in perfect harmony with truth
and justice." "The resources of infinite love have been
exhausted in devising and executing the plan of redemption
for man." It is love which draws man to God (Jer.
31:3) and leads him to repentance (Rom. 2:4), and "the Lord
has no reserve power with which to influence men. He can
give no greater manifestation of his love than that which he
has given." "Oh, what a God have we ! What a Benefac-
tor ! What claims has he upon our love ! Having collected
all the riches of the universe and laid open all the resources
of infinite power, he gave all the heavenly treasure into the
hands of Christ, and said: 'All these are for man. Use
them to convince him that there is no love greater than mine
in earth or heaven. His greatest happiness consists in lov-
ing me, and giving his heart to me, who hath loved him with
an infinite love.' " " He who has shared in the grace of
Christ is thereby placed under obligation to others (Rom.
1:14), and this grace is more sacred to him than life (Acts
20:24)." "The plan of salvation was laid by a sacrifice, a
gift" (2 Cor. 8: 9), and the same spirit should characterize all
Christians (Matt. ro: 8) as was shown by the Macedonians
(2 Cor. 8:3-5). "Thus while our gifts cannot recommend
us to God, or earn his favor, they are an evidence that we
have received the grace of Christ. They are a test of the
             THE FIRST. EPISTLE OF JOHN.

sincerity of our profession of love.- " He tests the love
ef his professed followers by committing to their tender
mercies the afflicted and bereaved ones, the poor and the
orphan." Deeds should accompany words in order to make
them effective. James 2:15, 16.
   2. VERSES 19-24.-A clear conscience is a good thing (2
Cor. 12), but God is the final judge (Rom. 2:16), and the
life record determines the result (Rev. 20:12). " Believers,
as such, ask only what is in accordance with God's will ; or
if they ask what God wills not, they bow their will to God's
will, and so God grants them either their request or some-
thing better than it."—Fausset.
   God can bestow special blessings upon those only who will
use them to his glory, which is always for their good. Deut.
6:24. The obedience of faith is evidence of such a purpose.
As Christ pleased not himself (Rom. 15:,3) but the Father
(John 8:29), so we are to do; but this is not natural to man
(Rom. 8:8), and is accomplished only through faith (Heb.
11:6). Belief in Christ insures salvation (Acts 16:31), and is
the work of God (John 6:29). Love to man is the outgrowth
of this experience. Christ dwells in genuine Christians
(2 Cor. 13:5), as in Paul (Gal 2:20), and works in us through
his power (Phil. 2: 13) to obedience (Rom. 5:19).

                           NOTE.
   "The connection of the visible with the invisible world,
the ministration of angels of God, and the agency of evil
spirits, are plainly revealed in the Scriptures, and insepara-
bly interwoven with human history." "Evil spirits, in the
beginning created sinless, were equal in nature, power, and
glory with the holy beings that are now God's messengers.
But fallen through sin, they are leagued together for the dis-
honor of God and the destruction of men." These evil spir-
its work "in the children of disobedience " (Eph. 2: 2), who
yield themselves as servants (Rom. 6: 16), in marvelous ways
(Matt. 24: 24), and more and more as time advances (2 Tim.
3:13), until fire is brought down from heaven (Rev. 13:13),
and "as the crowning act in the great drama of deception
Satan himself will personate Christ." "The people of God
are directed to the Scriptures as the safeguard against the
influence of false teachers and the delusive power of spirits
of darkness." Isa. 8:20. "Antichrist is to perform his
marvelous works in our sight. So closely will the counter.
feit resemble the true that it will be impossible to distin-
guish between them except by the Holy Scriptures." Error
is not to be countenanced, although preached by an angel
(Gal. r:8); neither, because we despise the messenger (Mark
              THE FIRST EPISTLE OE JOHN.                      23

6:3), are we to reject truth (John to: 37, 38). The incarnation
is the " secret of piety " (I Tim. 3:16, Young's translation),
the fellowship of which is to be made known to all (Eph.
3:9), and that as a personal experience (Col. 1:27). Christ
was born of the Spirit (Luke 1:35), and dwelt in the flesh
(John I : 14), and so he must dwell in our flesh (Eph. 3: 17),
living in us (Gal. 2: 2o), to give us victory (2 Cor. 2:14) in the
conflict with unseen powers (Eph. 6:12). Anyone who pre-
sents any other hope of salvation is a deceiver and an anti-
christ. 2 John 7. " Jesus fought all our battles during his
life upon earth" (John 16:.33), and "we each have a battle to
fight with a fallen foe." "The hand of the Infinite is
stretched over the battlements of heaven to grasp your hand
in its embrace. The mighty Helper is nigh to help the most
erring, the most sinful and despairing." God and the
world, the followers of Christ and the servants of Satan,
 "the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error," are in marked
 contrast. All are found in one of two classes (Matt. 22: 3o),
 and the same person cannot be found in both (Matt. 6:24).

                           NOTES.
   I. VERSES              Whenever the life of God is- in the
 hearts of men, it will flow out to others in love and blessing."
"Of God he hath been begotten and doth know God," is
Dr. Young's rendering of the last clause of verse 7. The
new birth is a past experience, but knowing God is always
a present experience. It is not only true that God loves
and is the source of love, but "God is love," and this is the
essence of the whole gospel. There can be no discord in
the home, the church, or the community when the love of
God abides in all hearts. God's love to us is not simply an
abstract thing, but it was shown in a 'most practical way.
John 3 : 16. Man lost hislife by sin (Gen. 2 :17), and Christ
came to restore life (John to : to), which is wholly the gift
of God (Rom. 6 : 23). " Had not God specially interposed,
Satan and man would have entered into an alliance against
heaven, and, instead of cherishing enmity against Satan,
the whole human family would have been united in oppo-
sition to God." "The reconciliation of mercy and justice
did not involve any compromise with sin, or ignore any
claim of justice ; but, by giving to each divine attribute its
ordained place, mercy could be exercised in the punishment
of sinful, impenitent man without destroying its clemency
or forfeiting its compassionate character, and justice could
be exercised in forgiving the repenting transgressor without
violating its integrity." " Said the angel,• Think ye that
the Father yielded up his beloved Son without a struggle?
No, no. It was even a struggle with the God of heaven,
             THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN.                    25

whether to let guilty man perish, or to give his beloved Son
to die for him."
   2. VERSES 2-14.—Men cannot see God with the natural
eye, but they ought to see his character wrought out in
Christians. " Perhaps they do not read the Bible, or do not
hear the voice that speaks to them in its pages ; they do not
see the love of God through his works. But if you are a
true representative of Jesus, it may be that through you
they will be led to understand something of his goodness,
and- be won to love and serve him." The Spirit is given to
those who ask for it (Luke it : 13), but the asking must be
in the name of Jesus (John 16 : 23, 24). "But to pray in the
name of Jesus is something more than a mere mention of
that name at the beginning and ending of a prayer. It is to
pray in the mind and spirit of Jesus, while we believe his
promises, rely upon his grace, and work his works." The
 purpose of Christ in coming to this world was to save (Luke
19: to), not to judge (John 12 :47); but rejection of his work
 results in condemnation (John 3: 18). The price paid was
 sufficient to redeem the world, but no man is saved contrary
 to his own will and choice. We can do nothing without
 him (John 15: 5), and he will do nothing without us. Christ
 sends his followers on the same errand which brought him
 to earth (John zo: 21), and has promised his presence to
 them (Matt. 28: 20). "As Jesus has revealed to us the true
 character of the Father, so we are to reveal Christ to a world
 that does not know his tender, pitying love."


  LESSON X.—December 9, 1893.
     THE INFLUENCE OF LOVE. 1 John 4 : 15-21.

   1. What relationship exists between God and him who
confesses that Jesus is his Son?
   2. What have we known and believed?
   3. What is God?
28           THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN.

   4. What follows as a result of this truth?
   5. What is the result of this union?
   6. What confidence will perfect love give us?
   7. What does perfect love exclude?
   8. Of what does the presence of fear give evidence?
   9. Why do believers love?
  ro. What charge is made against him who professes love
to God but hates his brother?
  11. What is the basis of this charge?
  12. What commandment has been received?


                           NOTES.
   I. VERSES 15, 16.—When Peter confessed that Jesus was
the Son of God, the reply of Christ indicated that this truth
cannot be discerned by the natural man (Matt. 16 : 16, 17),
and it is only when Christ, in whom God dwelt (2 Cor. 5: r9),
is-revealed.in us (Gal. 1 : 16) that we can confess this truth
in the sense of the scripture. Thus the Spirit which is to
testify of him (John 15 : 26) witnesses through us to his
divinity (t Cor. 12:3). The love of God can be known only
by experience, as it is poured out in the heart. Rom. 5 :5.
"Human language can never explain how the love of Christ
can take possession of the soul, and lead captive every
power of the mind ; but you will know it by personal ex-
perience." Since God is love, and all love is of God, no
one can be in love and separated from God at the same
time.
  2. VERSE 17.—The result aimed at in all God's love to
us is that we may be restored to his favor and dwell in his
presence (i Tim. 2 : 4), but this involves a testing of the
character (2 Cor. 5: to), and the law demands perfection
(James 2:1o). No righteousness of our own (Phil. 3 :9) will
give confidence in that day. Those who have "had a sense
of the righteousness of Jehovah, and felt the terror of ap-
pearing in their guilt and uncleanness before the Searcher
               TArE FIX ST EPISTLE OP JOHN.                    ft

  of hearts," will desire a robe of righteousness (Isa. 61 : to)
  as a wedding garment (Matt. 22 : II, 12), clean.. and white
  (Rev. 19:8). "None are so sinful that they cannot find
  strength, purity, and righteousness in Jesus, who died for
  them. He is waiting to strip them of their garments, stained
  and polluted with sin, and to put upon them the white robes
  of righteousness."
       Our likeness to Christ must begin here. "We must per-
  fect a Christlike character, or we shall never enter into the
   kingdom of heaven." "The saints in heaven will first have
  been saints on earth.".
       3. VERSE la—Although there is a certain fear (I Peter
      : 17) in which we are to live (Phil. 2: 12), yet "not in dis-
   trust of the grace of God, but in fear that self shall gain the
  supremacy. We are not to fear that there will be any failure
   on the part of God, but fear lest because of our own sinful
  inclinations any of us should seem to come short of the
   promise." " Here is where we need to watch, to strive, to
   pray, that nothing may entice us to choose another master,
   for we are always free to do this."
        God has given us every reason for assurance (Heb. 6:
. 17, 18) that he will carry us through (Phil. 1 :6) and enable
   us to pass the test (Jude 24), if we believe in him (2 Chron.
   20:20.
        4. VERSES I9-21.—" We love, because He first loved us,"
    is the Revised Version of verse 19. We should never have
    known the meaning of love, and never have exercised it
    toward anyone, if God had not first loved us. If we love
    God, whom we have not seen (I Peter I :8), then we shall
    surely love all the objects of his love about us whom we can
    see. This love is a proof to the world of our discipleship
    (John 13 :35). Love to God and love to man are insep-
    arably connected (Matt. 22 : 37-40), and both will be mani-
    fested by the follower of Christ. " There has been too
    much of a spirit to ask, 'Am I my brother's keeper? ' Said
     the angel, `Yea, thou art thy brother's keeper. Thou
25            THE FIRST EPISTLE OE JOHN.

shouldst have a watchful care for thy brother, be interested
for his welfare, and cherish a kind, loving spirit toward
him.'" "While we cannot fellowship those who are the
bitter enemies of Christ, we should cultivate that spirit of
meekness and love that characterized our Master,- a love
that thinketh no evil, and is not easily provoked."



     LESSON XI.—December 16, 1893.

           THE NEW BIRTH. I John 5: 1-6.

    r. Who is born of God?
   2. Can one love the Father and not love the Son?
   3. How is it known that one loves the children of God?
   4. What is the love of God?
   5. What is the nature of his commandments?
   6. Who overcomes the world?
   7. What is the victory?
   8. On what point must faith be exercised in order to
overcome the world?
   9. How did Christ come?
  10. What bears witness?
  it. For what reason?

                            NOTES.
  1.   VERSES I-3.—The new birth is the condition of en-
trance to the kingdom (John 3 :3), and it is a spiritual birth
(verse 5). Man "must have a new life from above. This
change is the new birth." To thus become children of God
is granted to believers (John I : 12, 13) in Christ (Gal. 3 : 26).
Such are children of promise (Gal. 4 : 28), being born of the
word (James r : 18). Love to the brethren is a proof of con-
version (1 John 3 : 14), and obedience to God is proof of love
             THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN.                       29

to the brethren, hence obedience is proof of conversion.
There can be no true lolie apart from obedience (John
14: 23), which is the highest form of worship. " If our
hearts are renewed in the likeness of God, if the divine love
is implanted in the soul, will not the law of God be carried
out in the life? When the principle of love is implanted in
the heart„when man is renewed after the image of Him that
created him, the new covenant promise is fulfilled, `I will
put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write
them.' Heb. to : 16. And if the law is written in the heart,
will it not shape the life?" " If we abide in Christ, if the love
of God dwells in us, our purposes, our actions will be in
harmony with the will of God as expressed in the precepts
of his holy law." God is love, and his law, " being an ex-
pression of the mind and will of God," "the transcript of
the character of God," is founded upon love (Matt. 22 : 4o)
and fulfilled in love (Rom. 13 :           His commandments
"are not burdensome" (Matt. II : 3o) to those who have
been set free from the bondage of sin (John 8: 34-36), but
 rather a delight (Ps. I :2). "The truth a bondage?—Yes,
in one sense; it binds the willing souls in captivity to Jesus
 Christ."
   2. VERSES 4, 5.—The greatest victories of the world have
been gained through faith (Heb. II :32-34) in Christ (1 Cor.
15:57), who was an overcomer (John 16 : 33), and "has
 given us the advantage of his victory, that we may be able
 to resist the temptations of the evil one." "We gain the
 victory through faith in Christ's power to save us." " This
 is the victory that halh overcome the world," is the reading
 of the Revised Version, thus making the victory an accom-
 plished fact.
    " The Lord Jesus is making experiments on human hearts
 through the exhibition of his mercy and abundant grace.
  He is effecting transformations so amazing that Satan, with
 all his triumphant boasting, with all his confederacy of evil
  united against God and the laws of his government, stands
30           THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN.

viewing them as a fortress impregnable to his sophistries
and delusions. They are to him an incomprehensible mys-
tery. The angels of God, seraphim and cherubim, the
powers commissioned to cooperate with human agencies,
look on with astonishment and joy that fallen men, once
children of wrath, are, through the training of Christ, de-
veloping characters after the divine similitude, to be sons
and daughters of God, to act an important part in the pleas-
ures and occupations of heaven." Only in him who " be-
lieveth that Jesus is the Son of God " can such a work as
this be wrought.
  3. VERSE 6.—Jesus came by water and by blood (John
19 : 34). " In the shed blood we see the sacrificed li Ce of
Christ, and in the water we see the Word and the Spirit
of Christ. In the blood we see expiation made for sin, and
through the blood we get remission of sins. Then comes
the water to sanctify and cleanse us."—Rodgers.
  Blood and water were both used in the typical service
(Lev. 14 : 6, 8) as symbols of cleansing. So we are cleansed
by the blood (t John 1 :7), and by water which is explained
to be the word (Eph. 5 : 26, compare with John 15:3).

                           NOTES.
   I. VERSES 8—ED.—Verse 7 of this chapter is omitted from
these lessons, as it rests upon insufficient authority, and is
not found in the Revised Version. The words "in earth"
are also omitted in the Revised Version, thus making the
statement of verse 8 general. In ancient times two or three
witnesses were required (Deut. 19 : 15), and this custom is
continued by our Saviour's express command (Matt. 18 : 16),
and referred to in other places (2 Cor. 13 : r ; Heb. ro :28).
The Spirit witnesses to our sonship (Rom. 8 :16), as it speaks
through the word (Acts 28 : 25 ; 2 Peter 1 : 21) (which is rep-
resented by the water, Eze. 36 : 25 ; John 15 : 3 ; Eph. 5 : 26),
of the efficacy of the blood of Christ (Heb. 9: 14). Those
who bear witness against Christ cannot agree (Mark 14:
55, 56), but there is always harmony in the truth. God
cannot lie (Titus I :2), even when he calls things that be
not as though they were (Rom. 4 : 17), because his word,
when spoken, has power to produce the thing or situation
mentioned. "In his dealing with sin God could employ
only righteousness and truth. Satan could use what God
could not—flattery and deceit." The closing clause of the
ninth verse is made clearer by the Revised Version : " For
 the witness of God is this, that he hath borne witness con-
cerning his Son." God has borne witness concerning his
32           THE 'FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN.

Son by audible voice (Matt. 3 : 17 ; 17 : 5) and by the works
wrought through him (John 10:37, 38). It is a serious thing
to charge God with being a liar ; but when he states a thing
and we do not believe him, that is what we do, yet he re-
mains the same. 2 Tim. 2: 13. Though all men deceive
(Rom. 3 :4), God does not (Num. 23 :19).
   2. VERSES II, 12.—The Lord had given the land to the
Israelites (Josh. I : 3) as soon as he had made provision for
its conquest by them, but not in their own strength (Ps.
44 : 3); so all blessings (Eph. :3), even eternal life, have
been bestowed upon us, and it only remains for us to accept
them upon the stated conditions. "Prayer is the key in
the hand of faith to unlock heaven's storehouse." "There
must be a power working from within, a new life from above,
before we can be changed from sin to holiness. That power
   Christ." "But it is the,life of Jesus Christ in the soul,
it is the active principle of love imparted by the Holy Spirit,
that alone will make the soul fruitful unto good works."
"Before works we must have eternal life; but when we are
born again, and made children of God by the word of grace,
then we perform good works."—Luther.
   3. VERSES. 13-15.—Those who believe "may know"
these things (Heb. 1i :1), not through faith in a creed, but
by receiving Him (John 1 : 12) who is the life (John 14 : 6).
It is God's will that we should be saved from sin (Gal. 1 :4)
and be sanctified (1 Thess. 4 : 3), not that we should perish
(Matt. 18: 14) ; and so we know that he hears the requests
of his children when they ask for these experiences. So the
Christian can wait patiently (Ps. 4o : 1-3) for the Lord to
work in his own way. " But to claim that prayer will always
be answered in the very way and for the particular thing
that we desire, is presumption." " We should be willing
to trust everything to the hand that was nailed to the cross
for us." "The prayer of the sincere heart offered in faith
will be heard in heaven. It may not be grammatical, but
             THE FIRST EPISTLE OF MIN-.                     33

if the heart is in it, it will ascend to the sanctuary, where
Jesus ministers, and he will present it to the Father, with the
fragrant incense of his own perfection, without our awkward,
stammering word, graceful and perfect through his merit,
for his righteousness-refines and ennobles it, and makes it
acceptable before the Father. The Lord accepts the prayer
of the sincere heart, and will answer it out of .his abundant
fullness."


  LESSON XI11.—December 30, 1893.

    KNOWING THE TRUE GOD. 1 John 5 : 16-21.

    t. What instruction is given for the benefit of those who
sin :lot unto death?
    2. What is said concerning a sin that is unto death?
    z. How is unrighteousness defined?
    4., Is there a sin not unto death?
    5. Who does not sin?
    6 What is his experience?
    7. What contrast is drawn between believers and the
world?
    8. What do we know of the Son of God?
    9. What has he given us?
   !(,. For what purpose?
     I. In whom are the believers?
   12. Who and what is he?
   r3. What closing admonition is given?

                           NOTES.
   I. VERSES 16-18.-c1i is evident from many scriptures that
the prayers of the righteous avail in behalf of the sinner who
has not entirely cut himself off from God (Job 42:7, 8), and
this intercession brings a blessing to him who prays (verse
14           THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN.

to). Thus a soul is saved from death. James 5:20. Sin
ends in death (James 1:15) unless repentance has been
granted to life (Acts 11: 18); but "it is the Holy Spirit that
draws men to Christ;" and so when this means of grace is
refused, there is no way by which the sinner may be reached.
"There is a terrible danger—a danger not sufficiently under-
stood—in delaying to yield to the pleading voice of God's
Holy Spirit, in choosing to live in sin; for such this delay
really is." " Every act of transgression, every neglect or
rejection of the grace of Christ, is reacting upon yourself; it
is hardening the heart, depraving the will, benumbing the
understanding, and not only making you less inclined to
yield, but less capable of yielding, to the tender pleading of
God's Holy Spirit." (There is a sin which is not pardoned
(Matt. 12:31, 32) here or hereafter. "What constitutes the
sin against the Holy Ghost?—It is willfully attributing to
Satan the work of the Holy Spirit. . . . It is through
the medium of his Spirit that God works upon the human
heart; and when men willfully reject the Spirit, and declare
it to be from Satan, they cut off the channel by which God
can communicate with them. . . . For a time persons
who have committed this sin may appear to be children of
God; but when circumstances arise to develop character,
and show what manner of spirit they are of, it will be found
that they are on the enemy's ground, standing under his
black banner."r? The Lord is righteous (Ps. 119:137), and
his command ents are righteousness (verse 172). Any-
thing out of harmony with his character, as expressed in
his law, is unrighteousness, or, sin, but it is by faith that
our hearts are purified (Ads 15:9) and that we attain
to righteousness '(Rom. 9:30-32); thus it is that what-
ever is not done through faith in the merit of Christ is sin
(Rom. 14:23). Christ's petition (John 17: 15) and thestate-
ment of Scripture (2 Thess. 3:3) both show that it is God
who keeps us from "the evil one" (both texts are so trans-
lated in the Revised Version), "but he can do nothing for us
              THE FIRST EPISTLE OF JOHN.


without our cooperation." It is so arranged in the plan of
salvation that its great object cannot be consummated with-
out human cooperation. "All the power is of God, and
all the glory is to redound to God, and yet all the responsi-
bility rests with the human agent." Satan was permitted to
tempt Christ (Matt. 4: r), but according to the prophecy (Gen.
3:15) he did not touch any vital part. So with the Christian.
Angels will give strength to us (Heb. 1:14), "but the minis-
try of angels will not insure us against sorrow and trial.
Angels ministered to Jesus; but their presence did not make
his life one of ease, nor free him from' conflict and tempta-
tion."
   2. VERSES I9-21.--" The whole world lieth in the evil one,"
Says the Revised Version; but Christians have been deliv-
ered. Col. 1:13.
    The Christian experience set forth in this epistle is a very
positive one. Fifteen times occurs the statement " we
know," or "know we," or "we have known," and by other
expressions it is clearly shown that positive knowledge con-
cerning the things of God is the privilege of the Christian.
    Cor. 2:12. One does not need to bow down to a visible
image in order to be an idolater. Eph. 5:5. " It is as easy
to make an idol of false doctrines and theories as to fashion
an idol of wood or stone. By misrepresenting the attributes
of God, Satan leads men to conceive of him in a false char-
acter. With many, a philosophical idea is enthroned in-the
place of Jehovah; while the living God, as he is revealed in
his word, in Christ, and in the works of creation, is worshiped
by but few. Thousands deify nature, while they deny the
 God of nature. Though in a different form, idolatry exists
in the Christian world to-day as verily as it existed among
 ancient Israel in the days of Elijah. The god of many pro-
 fessedly wise men, of philosophers, poets, politicians, jour-
 nalists,—the god of polished fashionable circles, of many
 colleges and universities, even of some theological institu-
  tions,—is little better than Baal, the sun-god of Phoenicia."
