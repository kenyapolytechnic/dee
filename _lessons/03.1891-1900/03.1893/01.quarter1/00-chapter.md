Lessons on the Word and Spirit.
             FOR SENIOR CLASSES..

  December 31,1892,           to March 25, 1893.


              INTRODUCTORY NOTE.
   THE object of this series of lessons is that we may learn
what the word of God is, and what blessings may come
to us through it. They are not prepared in order to prove
that the Bible is true, but are intended for those who
believe that it is the word of God, and they are designed
to bring out and illustrate what it says about itself.
It is hoped, therefore, that they will enlarge the under-
standing, and strengthen the faith of those who do be-
lieve. We should have the same confidence in what the
word of God says about itself as in what it teaches upon
any other subject, and we should always remember" that
the Scripture is given to instruct our reason, and not to
be judged by it. We are to believe what God says to us,
not because we can understand it and see the reason for
it, but because God says so. When we demand a full
understanding of every statement before accepting it, we
exalt ourselves to an equality with God, bring him
down to our level, and make him such as ourselves.
 When the matter is viewed properly, the mysteries of
the Bible are among the strong proofs that it is the word
of God. Our attitude should always be, "Speak, Lord,
                                                 ( 3)
4           LESSONS ON THE WORD AND SPIRIT.

for thy servant heareth ;" but our hearing should be with
the purpose of yielding to it. God says that he looks to
him who trembleth at his word. Reverence and humil-
ity should characterize us while we wait in the audience
chamber of the great Creator, to hear his word.
   The plan of develophg the lesson differs somewhat
from that which has heretofore been adopted, and this is
done with a purpose. The design is to encourage the
study of the scriptures used as the basis of the lesson,
and others related 10.them, for spiritual benefit, rather
than merely to learn the lesson to recite it. One who
gets the subject in mind will have no difficulty in answer-
ing any question properly connected with it. Each
teacher can make such use of the notes as he wishes.
 Questions can be framed covering the thoughts presented
 if that is deemed to be desirable. The "suggestive
questions" will open the way for further work when it
 may be thought profitable.

         word? How much?
11. Questions on lea. 55 :8-11.
     1. What are words intended to convey?

          'LESSONS ON THE WORD AND SPIRIT. '

    3. How much difference, then, will there be between
        God's word and man's word?
    4. What definite results are produced by rain and
        snow?
    5. What comparison is made between these agencies
        and God's word?
    6. How must the word be received in order that it
        may accomplish such results?
!11. Questions on Heb. 4:12, Revised Ver-
    sion.
    1. What characteristics of God's word are here men-
        tioned?
    2. Are these true of man's word? Show the differ-
        ence quite fully.
IV. Questions on John 1 :1-4.
    1. Who is meant by the Word?
    2. Why is He called the Word?
    3. What is found in Him?

                          NOTES.
   1. PAUL knew whom he had believed (2 Tim. 1: 12), and
was aware that it made a great difference how the word
was received (1 Cor. 2: 4, 5). The difference between
God's word and man's word is just as great as the differ-
ence between God and man, which is simply infinite.
See Ps. 146 : 3 ; Isa. 26 : 4 ; 1 Cor. 1 : 25. God's word
works in those who believe it as God's word. The gospel
"is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that be-
lieveth" (Rom. 1: 16), and the word of the Lord is preached
by the gospel (1 Peter 1 : 25), but it must be believed in
order to be of profit (Heb. 4 : 2).
   2. MAN puts his own thoughts into words (Luke 6 : 45),
and what one man has thus clothed with language, an-
other man can study out, and so exhaust his meaning.
           LESSONS ON THE WORD AND SPIRIT'

Not so with God's word. His words contain a depth of
meaning which only his Spirit can reveal to us (1 Cor. 2 :
11, 12), and for this purpose was the Spirit promised (John
16: 13 ; 1 Cor. 2 : 10). As rain and snow are sent upon
the earth to accomplish definite results, so God sends his
word (Ps 107: 20; Matt. 8: 8). It is sent to bring salva-
tion (Acts 13: 26; James 1: 21), and it will accomplish
this for all who receive it. As the land is made fruitful
by receiving the rain (Heb. 6 : 7), so God will cause right-
eousness to spring forth (Isa. 61: 11). When spoken faith-
fully the word will have a powerful effect (Jer. 23 : 28, 29),
and it is able to build up (Acts 20 : 32) those who receive
it.
   3. THE Revised Version of Heb. 4 : 12 is as follows: " For
the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than
any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing
of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and quick
to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart." The
words of God are not only living words, but they are
spirit and life (John 6 : 63) to those who believe them.
Life seems to belong to everything that is associated with
God. He not only has life in himself (John 5 : 26) but
his throne is a living throne (Ezekiel 1). Besides this we
have the word of life (Phil. 2: 16), the breath of life
 (Gen. 2: 7), the bread of life (John 6: 48), the river of
life, and the tree of life (Rev. 22 : 1, 2). The word is the
sword of the Spirit (Eph. 6: 17), for the Spirit dwells in
the word (compare James 1: 18 and 1 Peter 1: 23 with
John 3 : 5), and so it'is said of Christ, who spoke for God
(John 3 : 34), that a sharp two-edged sword went out of
his mouth (Rev. 1: 16).
  4. CHRIST is called the Word of God (Rev. 19 : 11-13),
not only because he spake the words of God (Dent. 18 :
18; John 17 : 8), but also because he was a living procla-
mation to the world of the character of God (2 Con 5:
           LESSONS ON TEE WORD AND SPIRIT.              7    -




19; John 14 : 9, 10). The mystery of the incarnation,
God with us (Matt. 1 : 23), divinity veiled in humanity,
is repeated in.the word in which the divine Spirit dwells
in human language. " The union of the divine and the
human, manifest in Christ, exists also in the Bible. The
truths revealed are all `given by inspiration of God;'
yet they are expressed in the words of men, and are
adapted to human needs. Thus it may be said of the
Book of God, as it was of Christ, that `the Word was
made flesh, and dwelt among us.' And this fact, so far
from being an argument against the Bible, should
strengthen faith in it as the word of God. Those who
pronounce upon the inspiration of the Scriptures, accept-
ing some portions as divine, while they reject other parts
as human, overlook the fact that Christ, the divine, par-
took of our human nature, that he might reach human-
ity. In the work of God for man's redemption, divinity
and humanity are combined." As Christ is a personal
Saviour (Gal. 2: 20), so God's word is given to each one
as an individual. "The relations between God and each
soul are as distinct and full as though there were not an-
other soul for whom he gave his beloved Son." His word
is to be regarded by each one as though he were the only
one to whom God had thus spoken.
                  SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.

  1. How should the Bible be studied?
  2. Should the Bible be studied daily? Why?
  3. Can the unlearned receive help from God's word?
Why?
  4. Can the educated exhaust it? Why?
  52 Who will receive the greatest benefit from the word
of God?

                         NOTES.
  1. THE Holy Scriptures which Timothy had known
from a child (2 Tim. 3 : 15) were no doubt those writings
now collected under the general name of the Old Testa-
ment, but the New Testament books are by their own
statements put on an equality with them. Thus we learn
           LESSONS ON THE WORD AND SPIRIT.                9

(2 Peter 3 : 15, 16) that some wrest the epistles of Paul as
they do other scriptures. Paul writes to the Corinthians
(1 Cor. 14 : 37), demanding that he who is a prophet or
spiritual should acknowledge that the things which he
writes are the commandments of the Lord. The words
spoken by the prophets and the commandment of the
Lord through the apostle (2 Peter 3 : 2, Revised Version)
are to have equal authority. Thus "all Scripture" is given
by inspiration of God (God-breathed). It is entirely un-
necessary to construct any theory of inspiration. We
simply know that all Scripture is inspired of God. It
may be well to note, however, that there can be no such
thing as different degrees of inspiration. Such a view
destroys the authority of God's word and gives to each
one a Bible made by himself. Having been tried at the
bar of his own reason, it contains only that authority
which he has allowed to it. The historical books, as well
as the prophetic books, are inspired. A prophet is one
who speaks for God (John 1 : 23 ; Luke 7 : 28), and it
makes no.difference whether he is dealing with the past
or future. It requires inspiration to select such events of
history as will convey valuable lessons to all persons for
all time, and make an absolutely truthful record of them,
just as it requires inspiration to tell what will happen in
the future. This inspired history is full of comfort for
us (Rom. 15 : 4). These things happened to them, but are
written for us (1 Cor. 10 : 11), that we might have the les-
sons from their experiences rather than from similar ones
of our own.
  2. TEE Revised Version of 2 Peter 1: 21 may make the
meaning clearer: "For no prophecy ever came by the
will of man ; but men spake from God, being moved by
the Holy Ghost." The word " prophecy " covers the
same ground as the word " Scripture." What was called
the Scripture was known under three general divisions
10         LESSONS ON THE WORD AND SPIRIT.

(Luke 24 : 44), and those who wrote each division are
designated as prophets. Moses was a prophet (Deut. 34 :
10) ; David was a prophet (Acts 2 : 29, 30), and the same
is true of all through whom God has spoken (Luke 1: 70;
Acts 3 : 18). As no person can be converted simply by
his own will (John 1: 12, 13), so one who speaks for God
cannot do so at will. Men are the instruments, but they
must be moved by the Holy Ghost. Sometimes the Holy
Ghost is represented as speaking (Acts 28 : 25), but some
man is the mouthpiece. That this is so, and yet each
writer preseryes his individuality in a style of his own,
presents no more difficulty to the believer than does his
own Christian experience. This divine paradox (Phil.
2: 12, 13) appears in many phases, but can always be un-
derstood by faith. The case of Balaam (Num. 22: 24)
and that of Caiaphas (John 11: 49-51) will illustrate this
text.
   3. Goo has promised to speak to prophets (Num. 12 :
6), that they might act as his spokesmen to the people
(Jer. 1: 7), and they were to speak the words as his words
(Eze. 3 : 10, 11). The prophet was to be very careful not
to change God's message (Jer..26 : 2), and was held respon-
sible to God for the faithful proclamation of what had
been said to him (Eze. 33 : 7-9). It was necessary that
the prophets should study their own writings (1 Peter 1:
10, 11) in order to know what had been revealed through
them. Christ was a prophet (Luke 24 : 19), through whom
God had promised to speak (Deut. 18 : 18), and through
whom he did speak (John 17 : 8), and he was always only
a mouthpiece for God (John 12 : 49). So it was with Da-
vid (2 Sam. 23: 2), and so it was with all through whom
the word of God was given.

12          LESSONS ON THE WORD AND SPIRIT.

                           NOTES.
    1. IT iS very important that we should have a correct
 understanding of the power of God's word in creation,
 in order to appreciate his power in redemption. The
 current teaching upon this subject has dcne much to un-
 dermine faith in God's word and its power He simply
 spake and "it was" (Ps. 33: 9), he commanded and " it
 standeth" (Young's translation). The breath of God's
 mouth is a breath of life (Gen. 2 : 7 ; Job 33 : 41. It has
 the same creative power as his word (compare Job 37 :
10 and Ps. 147: 15-17). So his word, which is life (John
6 : 63), is God-breathed (2 Tim. 3: 16, Young's translation).
 In the record of creation we read (Gen. 1 : 3, 6, 9, 11, 14,
20, 24) that at each step in the work "God said" let it be
so and "it was so." He made "light to shine out of
 darkness" (2 Cor. 4: 6) by calling for it (Gen. 1 : 3). The
true God is distinguished by this creative power (Ps. 95 :
4, 5), and the call to worship him is based upon the
same reason (Rev. 14 : 7). That "science falsely so
called" (1 Tim. 6: 20) which teaches that only a force
and not a person is the creator, and that an indefinite
period of time was required to accomplish the work, has
struck at the very foundation of true Christianity by
weakening the faith in the power of God's word, and de-
stroying the foundation for the Bible Sabbath. (Read
"Patriarchs and Prophets," chap. 9.)
   2. IT is only through faith that we can know anything
about the work of creation. We can only know the
things which he has revealed (Deut. 29: 29) by believing
them. Thus our knowledge of these things is the result
of our faith, and not our faith the result of our knowl-
edge. The fact of creation, however, is constantly before
us, and "the things that are made" bear testimony daily
to "his eternal power and Godhead" (Rom. 1: 20). So
God's glory is manifested to us (Pi. 19 :1), and we are
            LESSONS ON THE WORD AND SPIRIT.                      13

encouraged to trust him for our need Phil. 4 : 19), re-
membering that the riches of his glory (Eph. 3 : 16) and
the riches of his grace (Eph. 1 : 7) are the same.
   3. MEN are willingly ignorant of, or "willfully forget,'
the power. of God's word in creation. There is no ex-
cuse for this. The most reasonable thing in the world is
to believe just what the Bible says about it, and this is
the only source of positive knowledge. Scientists may
specukee, but the one who believes God's word knows.
   4. CHRIST was the agent in creation (Col. 1: 15, 16;
John 1: 3), and the same word that created is the power
which now preserves (Neh. 9 : 6). The universe is not
left to run itself (Ps. 145: 9), but the unwearied worker
 (John 5 : 17) still directs it (Isa. 40 : 20), and cares for all
his creatures (Matt. 10 : 20-31). He controls the elements.
by his word (Ps. 147: 15-18; Jer. 10: 13), and they ac-
 complish his purpose (Ps. 148: 8). The twenty-ninth
 psalm mentions some things accomplished by the voice
 of the Lord.
                     SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.
  1. Can you see any special reason why the first chapter
of Genesis has been attacked so vigorously during the
last fifty years?.
  2. Has this fact any connection with the Sabbath re-
form which has arisen during the same period?
  3. Who honored the "god of forces"? and what was
the result?
  4. How will the new heavens and the new earth be
created?
   SPECIAL NOTE.—It should be reniembered that translation§ or ver-
 sions are not inspired, and so it is perfectly proper that we should
 have different translations and a Revised Version. The advantage
 of marginal readings and several translations is apparent, as it IS
 often impossible to express the full meaning by any one reading. A
 good illustration is found in John 1: 12, where the text and two max-
14          LESSONS ON THE WORD AND SPIRIT.

ginal readings are all required to give the complete idea. But the
original manuscripts are never revised. So also we should remember
that a record may be inspired and yet may contain statements which
are not true. Inspiration records the fact that Satan said to our first
parents, "Ye shall not surely die;" but this does not make the state-
ment true. So in many similar instances which will be readily re-
called.

                         NOTES.
  1. MAN  lost his life by the first act of disobedience
(Gen. 2: 17). By the mercy and forbearance of God,
probation has been granted to him; but life has been
           LESSONS ON THE WORD AND SPIRIT.                15

forfeited by sin (Eph. 2 : 1). Death has been abolished
and life brought to light through the gospel (2 Tim. 1:
10), which is the power of God (Rom. 1 : 16), and the
basis of which is his word (1 Peter 1: 25). This word is
life, and when received as the word of God (1 Thess. 2:
13) it begets new life in the believer. The word is both
spirit and life (John 6 : 63) ; and so the Spirit is spoken of
as the agency in the new birth. "Like the wind, which
is invisible, yet the effects of which are plainly seen and
felt, is the Spirit of God in its work upon the human
heart. That regenerating power, which no human eye
can see, begets a new life in the soul; it creates a new
being in the image of God." This work is beyond the
power of man to accomplish (John 1: 13), and everyone
in whom it is wrought is said to know God (1 John 4 : 7),
or to be known of God (Gal. 4 : 9), and to be born of God
(1 John 5: 1, 18). Thus, to know God is eternal life
(John 17 : 3), and through this knowledge blessings are
multiplied to us (2 Peter 1 : 2). In this knowledge one
may glory (Jer. 9: 23, 24). God's Spirit is a spirit of
 knowledge (Isa. 11 : 2), and is given to guide us into all
 truth (John 16 : 13), and is superior to any merely human
 teacher (1 John 2: 27) ; but it works through the word in
 which it dwells. It is in this way that it defeats the en-
 emy (Isa. 59 : 19), and witnesses to our acceptance with
 God (Rom. 8 : 16) by bringing the word of God to our re-
 membrance (John 14 : 26).
  2. WATER is used as a symbol of cleansing (1 Peter 3:
21) ; but the power is in the word (Eph. 5 : 25-27), by
which we are made clean (John 15 : 3), through the spirit
which dwells in it (Titus 3 : 5). Christ is also called the
Word (John 1: 1), and in 'him is life (John 1 : 4 ; 5 : 26)
and the power to give life (1 Cor. 15 : 45, Revised Version).
So when we receive him, which is done by believing on
him (John 1 : 12 ; Eph. 3 : 17), we have life (1 John 5 :
16         LESSONS ON THE WORD AND SPIRIT

12), Christ himself dwelling in us (Gal. 2 : 20) by his word
(Col. 3 : 16). So we feed upon him (John 6 : 57) in study-
ing his word (Jer. 15: 16). Thus the same Word, by
which all things were created in the beginning, begets by
the same power a new life in the believer.

                           NOTE.
  MAN was originally created in God's image' (Gen. 1 : 27),
" perfect in his being and in harmony with God," but his
nature became changed through transgression. The whole
purpose of the plan of salvation is that the linage of God
may be restored in the soul and the creature again be in
harmony with the Creator.. Sin has brought enmity
(Rom 8: 7), but God's purpose is peace. (Jer. 29: 11)
through Christ (Eph. 2 : 14). But the heart is the source
of evil (Mark 7 : 21-23), which separates from God (Isa.
59 : 2), and man cannot of himself change it (Job 14 : 4)
and do good (Jer. 13 : 23). There must be a death of the
body of sin (Rom. 6 : 6), a burial (verse 4), and a new life
unto God (verse 11) through Christ. A complete change
is wrought (2 Cor. 5 : 17), which is nothing less than cre-
ation (Gal. 6 : 15, Revised Version, margin). Then good
works can be done (Eph. 2 : 10) through the power work-
ing in us (Col. 1 : 29), which is God in Christ (Phil. 2 : 13),
and which is the same power that gives life to the dead
 (Eph. 1: 19, 20). Thus redemption is simply "a new
creation," and the gospel is the same creative power
 manifested in salvation (Rom. 1 : 16). But we have
learned that this creative power is in God's word (lesson
Is        ,LESSONS ON THE WORD AND SPIRIT

3), and it is equally true whether applied to the crea-
tion of a world or a new heart. Through faith in his
promises our natures may be changed (2 Peter 1: 4) by
the power of his word. Our ground of hope is that our
Creator is our Redeemer (read Isaiah 43 and 44), and he
is our Strength (Isa. 26: 4) and our Salvation (Isa. 12: 2).
When he speaks righteousness in place of sin (Rom. 3:
25), and "is declaring righteous" the ungodly (Rom. 4:
5, Young's translation), we are to believe in the power of
his word supplying the fact. " God makes a man right-
eous by counting him so. This is the divine paradox of
justification by faith."
                  SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.

  1. Why was it impossible for an angel to redeem the
world?
  2. What institution reminds us of God's creative
power?

all that is called God" should attempt to establish a rival
institution?

20          LESSONS ON THE TVORD AND SPIRIT.

 us, bearing upon our Christian experience. We are sick
 with sin (Isa. 1 : 5, 6), "but it is the will sof God to cleanse
 us from sin, to make us his children, and to enable us to
 live a holy life." The power is in his word (John 15: 3)
 to cleanse us from all unrighteousness (1 John 1: 9), and
 God desires to say to each one, "Be thou clean" (Mark
1 : 41). We are to believe that he is "able to do this"
(Matt. 9 : 2S), and, as of old, so he says to-day, "Accord-
ing to your faith be it unto you" (verse 29, compare with
 Mark 5 : 34 ; 10 : 52, etc.). The result of disease finally is
death, as sin ends in the second death (James 1: 15 ;
 Rom. 6: 23), and Satan has power over death (Heb. 2:
14). He is the prince of this world (John 12: 31), but
Christ has overcome the world (John 16: 33), meeting
the temptations of Satan with the word of God (read
Matt. 4 : 1-11), which is the sword of the Spirit (Eph. 6 :
17). Faith in the same power gives us the same victory
(1 John 5 : 4). Lazarus came forth from the grave in re-
sponse to the word of Christ (John 11 : 43, 44), though
bound hand and foot; but the same authority said,
"Loose him." So we who were dead have been made
alive (Eph. 2: 1), and set free from the power of sin
(John 8: 34-36), and all who are in their graves will be
brought forth by the power of the same word (John 5 :
28, 29). Christ has given peace to his followers (John
14: 27), but the wicked know not of this peace (Isa. 57 :
20, 21). When the storms of life arise, his word will
bring a calm, as it did upon the lake. Christ's power
over the elements is further shown. by his walking upon
the water (Matt. 14 : 25-31). When he said to Peter,
" Come" (verse 29), he gave him his word to walk upon,
and it sustained him so long as he did not doubt. The
word of God placed the earth here (Heb. 11: 3); it is up-
held by the same word (Heb. 1 : 2), and by the same it
will be renewed .(Heb. 12 : 26, 27). Then the same word,
"Come," which upheld Peter, will be spoken to the
           LESSONS ON THE WORD AND SPIRIT.              21

saints (Matt. 25 : 34), and they will meet the Lord in the
air (1 Thess. 4 : 17). All the miracles were recorded for a
purpose (John 20: 31), and should lead to unshaken con-
fidence in the power of God's word manifested in salva-
tion.
                   SUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS.

  1. How can the miracles, which Satan will have pcwer
to perform be distinguished from those wrought by the
power of God's word?
  2. What relation have "Faith Cures," "Christian Sci-
ence," etc., to this subject?
  3. How will the present treatment of God's word by
eminent men prepare the people for the "false revivals"
of the last days?

     2. What result followed?
     3. What inquiry did they make?
     4. What two duties were enjoined?
     5. What gift was promised?
     6. To whom was the promise made?
                          NOTES.
   1. No attempt will be made in these lessons to define
the Holy Spirit. The subject will be considered from
the practical rather than from the theoretical side.
We know that it is omnipresent. Ps. 139: 7-12. We
know that it is the.eternal Spirit. Heb. 9 : 14. We know
that it is the Comforter (John 14 : 26), and the Spirit of
truth (John 15: 26). These names are given because
there is comfort in the truth. It is of much more im-
portance to us that we receive the Spirit than that we try
to discern what it is. " Holy Ghost " and " Holy Spirit "
are from the same original words, and seem to be used
interchangeably in the King James' Version. The Amer-
ican members of the Revision Committee desired to use
in all cases the term " Holy Spirit."
   2. FAITH in Christ makes us children of God (Gal. 3 :
26), and the Spirit is given because we are sons (Gal. 4:
6) ; ,and so Paul asked the believers if they had received
the Holy Spirit (Acts 19 : 2). All things are ours (1 Cor.
3: 22), but God does not give spiritual blessings against
our will, and so we are to ask (Matt. 7 : 7) for the Spirit,
with the assurance that he will give willingly (Luke 11:
13'. This the disciples did (Acts 1 : 5, 14), and their re-
quest was granted (Acts 2 : 4). The promise that was ful-
filled to them (Joel 2 : 28, 29) is for us also. The posses-
sion of the Spirit irdicah,s a union with God (1 John 3:
24; 4 : 13),,and no one can be Christ's without it (Rom. 8:
          LESSONS ON THE WORD AND SPIRIT.                23

9). Christ bestowed it upon his disciples (John 20 : 21,
22), and we are exhorted to be filled with it (Eph. 5 : 18).
We receive it by faith. Gal. 3 : 2.
   " Just prior to his leaving his disciples for the heavenly
courts, Jesus encouraged them with the promise of the
Holy Spirit. This promise belongs to us as much as it
did to them, and yet how rarely is it presented before the
people, and its reception spoken of in the church. In
consequence of this silence upon this mast important
theme, what promise do we know less about by its prac-
tical fulfillment than this rich promise of the gift of the
Holy Spirit, whereby efficiency is to be gi/en to all our
spiritual labor? This promised blessing, if claimed by
faith, would bring all other blessings in its train, and it
is to be given liberally to the people of God. Through
the cunning devices of the enemy the minds of God's
people seem to be incapable of comprehending and ap-
propriating the promises of God. They seem to think
that only the scantiest showers of grace are to fall upon
the thirsty soul. . . . The power of God awaits their
demand and reception. . . .
   "The Christian must build upon the foundation if he
would build a strong, symmetrical character, if he would
 be well balanced in his religious experience. It is in this
 way that the man will be prepared to meet the demands
 of truth and righteousness, as they are represented in the
 Bible; for he will be sustained and energized by the Holy
 Spirit of God. He who is a true Christian combines great
 tenderness of feeling with great firmness of purpose, with
 unswerving fidelity to God ; he will in no case become
 the betrayer of sacred trusts. He who is endowed with
 the Holy Spirit has great capacities of heart and intellect,
 with strength of will and purpose that is unconquerable."

                            NOTE.'
   Somn of the operations of the Spirit are brought out
in this lesson. God's Spirit dwells in his word (compare
John 3 : 5 with James 1 : 18 and 1 Peter 1: 23), and it is
through this agency that it reproves the-world. The
Spirit is an instructor (Neh. 9: 23), to teach all things
(John 14 : 26), according to the promise (John 6: 45), and
to testify of Christ (John 15: 26). It is the agent in in-
spiration (2 Peter 1: 21), testified in the prophets (1 Peter
1 : 11), and is to speak in those who are persecuted (Matt.
10: 19, 20). Through the word it witnesses that we are
the children of God (Bom. 8 : 16) and lifts up a standard
against the enemy (Isa. 59 : 19). The Spirit strives with
 men (Gen. 6: 3), helps in prayer (Born. 8: 26; Jude 20;
 Eph. 6: 18), and guides them in the right way (Isa. 30:
21). It renews (Titus 3 : 5), quickens (1 Peter 3: 18), and
sanctifies (2 Thess. 2: 13). The practical importance of
 receiving the Spirit is apparent, as we see the part which
 it acts in God's purpose concerning man.
    "The Holy Spirit exalts.and glorifies the Saviour. It
 is his office to present Christ, the purity of his righteous-
 ness, and the great salvation that we have through him.
 Jesus says, `He shall receive of mine, and shall show it
 unto you.' The Spirit of truth is the only effectual
 teacher of divine truth. How must God esteem the hu-
 man race, since he gave his Son to die for them, and ap-
  points his Spirit to be man's teacher and continual guide."

THE NEW BIRTH AND THE INDWELLING
              SPIRIT.

I11. Questions on 1 Cor 3:16.
     1. Whose temple are we?
     2. Who dwells in us?
IV. Questions on 1 Cor. 6:19.
     1. What is the body?
     2. From whom does the Holy Spirit come?
     3. Do we belong to self?

                           NOTE.
   IT is worse than useless to speculate on the process of
ti!le new birth. It is our privilege, however, to know the
fact. "Like the wind, which is invisible, yet the ef-
fects of which are plainly seen and felt, is the Spirit of
Cod in its work upon the human heart, That regenerat-
           LESSONS ON THE WORD AND SPIRIT.                 29

ing power which no human eye can see, begets a new life
in the soul ; it creates a new being in the image of God."
To know God (John 17 : 3), or to be known of him (Gal.
4 : 9), involves that idea of that generative power of the
Holy Spirit which creates a new heart (Ps. 51: 10). The
birth of Christ, in whom God was manifested (2 Cor. 5:
19), and who is God with us (Matt. 1: 25), was due to the
Holy Spirit (Luke 1: 35) ; so we are begotten of God
through his word (James 1 : 18), are born of his Spirit
(John 3 : 3, 5), are sons now (1 John 3 : 1, 2), receive power
by the Holy Spirit (Acts 1: 8). Religion is not a mere
sentiment, but a life ; and the mystery of godliness (or
the "secret of piety " ) is that as God dwelt and worked
in Christ (John 14 : 10), and in him condemned sin in the
 flesh (Rom. 8 : 3), so Christ shall dwell in us (Eph. 3 : 17),
 and live in us (Gal. 2 : 20), being with us always (Matt.
28: 20), enabling us to do all things (Phil. 4: 13). All
 this new life and power come through the Holy Spirit
 (Eph. 3 : 16), which is to dwell in us (John 14 : 17). Thus
 it was that after Christ left his disciples, "their union
 with him was closer than when he was personally with
 them." Thus we become a habitation of God (Eph. 2:
22), a spiritual house (1 Peter 2: 5; Heb. 3: 6), a temple
 of God in which he dwells (2 Cor. 6 :16).

    1. Do outward ceremonies make one a Jew?
    2. Who is the true Jew?
    3. What, then is the true circumcision?
    4. Who is to approve it?
III Questions on Gal. 3:13, 14.
    1. From what has Christ redeemed us?
    2. How did he accomplish this?
    3. What blessing was thus brought to the Gentiles?
    4. As a result of this blessing what are we to re-
        ceive?
                           NOTE.
  ABRAHAM exercised the faith which brought righteous-
ness before he received circumcision (Gen. 15 : 5, 6; 17 : 10).
This was a sign or seal of the inward work. Now God
has given a different sign or seal of the same inward
work. Now every true Jew is a Christian, and every
Christian is a Jew (Gal. 3 : 29). Now circumcision is of
the heart only ; then it was in the flesh as a type of that
of the heart (Deut. 10 : 16; 30 : 6). The blessing of Abra-
ham is righteousness by faith, and this comes through
the work of Christ. Having attained to this blessing
through believing (Rom. 3 : 22 ; 10 : 10), we then receive
the seal of righteousness (Eph. 1: 13), which is the Holy
Spirit (Eph 4 : 30). God gave of his Spirit without meas-
ure to Christ (John 3 : 34), thus witnessing to the fullness
of his righteousness. The 144,000 are without fault
(Rev. 14 : 5), and as a sign that they are all righteous (Isa.
60: 21) they have received the latter rain (Zech. 10: 1), as
the children of Israel were all circumcised just before
taking possession of the promised land (Josh. 5 : 2).

1. "WHILE the work of the Spirit is silent and impercep-
Jo .       LESSONS ON TIIE WORD AND SPIRIT.

tible, its effects are manifest. If the heart has been re-
newed by the Spirit of God, the life will bear witness to
the fact." " Our lives will reveal whether the grace of
God is dwelling in us."• "And wherever the life of God
is in the hearts of men, it wilt flow out to others in love
and blessing " Love is of God (1 John 4 : 17, Revised
Version), and comes to us by the Spirit (Rom. 5 : 5).
"The excellence and value of pure love consist in its
efficiency to do good, and to do nothing else but good"
(Rom. 13: 10; 1 Cor. 13 : 4-7, Revised Version). Christ
desires us to have joy (John 15: 11), and has given us
peace (John 14 : 27), which is really giving us himself
(Eph. 2 : 14 \ , and both these gifts are in the Holy Spirit
(Rom. 14 : 17). Those who are renewed after the image
of God (Col. 3: 10) will exhibit long-suffering (verse 12),
will be gentle (2 Tim. 2 : 24), and yet will be great (2 Sam..
22 : 36).
   2. GOD anointed Jesus with the Holy Spirit (Acts 10:
38), so he went about doing good. Our present need is
the same anointing (Rev..3 : 18). Where the Spirit of
God is, there is unity (Eph. 4 : 3, 4) and liberty (2 Cor. 3 :
17). We are to walk worthy of our calling (Eph. 4: 1),
which means to walk according to the Spirit (Rom. 8 : 1,
4). The Spirit being one of power (Rom. 15 : 13, 19), and
life (Rom. 8 :2), and Christ being a life-giving spirit (1
Cor. 15: 45, Revised Version; John 5 : 21), we are strong
in him (Eph. 6: 10), and not in our own might (Zech.
4 : 6). The gospel is to be preached with the Holy Spirit
(1 Peter 1: 12 ; 1 Thess. 1: 5), not in man's wisdc-ta (1 Cot
2 : 4) ; and thus the minister of God is. approved (2 Cor.
6: 4). "It is the absence of the Holy Spirit and of the
grace of God that makes the gospel ministry so powerless
to convict and convert." Such are some of the ways in
which the Holy Spirit will manifest itself in those who
receive it.

• 17. What reason is given for this command?
  18. What conclusion is drawn?

                          NOTES.
   1. TnE covenant mentioned by Jeremiah "had ex-
isted by the promise of God since the first intimation of
redemption had been given. It had been accepted by
faith; yet, when ratified by Christ, it is called a new
covenant." "That the new covenant was valid in the
days of Abraham is evident from the fact that it was
then confirmed both by the promise and by the oath of
God." Heb. 6: 17, 18.
   2. IN the new covenant the law is written in the heart
by the Spirit (2 Cor. 3 : 3), just as it was in Christ's heart
(Ps. 40 : 8). The word of God being spirit and life (John
6: C3), when in the heart keeps from sin (Ps. 119: 11),
and establishes the righteous in the way (Ps. 37: 31).
The law of God "is an expression of the- will of God,"
"the transcript of the character of God." In Christ this
character was illustrated. "He gave to man a new in-
terpretation of God." He was the Word made flesh
(John 1: 14', and thus, when the law of God is in the
heart, it is Simply Christ in us the hope of glory (Col.
1 : 27).
   3. ISAAC was a child of faith (Heb. 11 : 11), and so of
promise (Rom. 9 : 9). It is only children of promise who
are children of God (verse 8). Such are born of the
Spirit, and through faith become partakers of the divine
nature (2 Peter 1 : 4). These promises are the better prom-
ises (Heb. II : 6), even the promises of God. All who are
now depending upon their own promises merely to obey
God, have been born after the flesh only, and are in
bondage (John 8 : 34). It is our privilege to be free
(verse 32), and as sons to abide in the house ever (verse
35, Revised Version), and not to be cast out (Matt. 22 : 13).

What
about India?
         As the Sabbath-school donations throughout the world
         for the first quarter of 1893 are to go toward establishing
         the gospel in India, it becomes important that all—teachers
         and scholars—should become somewhat familiar with this
         country and its people.

NatiN'te Life in India
         Was written by Rev. Henry Rice, of Madras, who spent
         upwards of eighteen years among all classes of people in
         the various parts of India, and writes of what he has aces
         and heard.    He speaks of the Castes and Sects, the Manners
         and Customs of the People, their Religion and Worship,
         gives some Traits of Hindu Character, speaks of the efforts
         to educate the people and the Importance of Education
         as an Evangelistic Agency, shows the necessity of
         Christian Literature being Widely Circulated, and tells of
         the Success of Past Missionary Effort, and the Outlook for
         the Future.
