              INTRODUCTORY NOTE.

   IN the study of these lessons on the coming of the
Lord it is expected that the pupil will make an effort to
commit the leading texts so as to repeat them without
the Bible. It will be well to study the historical extracts
until the substance of them can be readily given. As the
day of the Lord is drawing near, those who are looking
for him should be ready to give a reason for the hope
that is in them. To do this means more than to point
the hearer to the text in the Bible. It means that the be-
liever is filled with that word, until it flows fresh from
the mind. We should not be satisfied when we have
looked up the texts that are given in the lessons, but
should let these texts lead us to others on the same sub-
ject. If the student will do this, the study of the coming
of the Lord will be a profitable study.

                          NOTES.
   I. THE original word from which our word " redemp-
tion" comes is defined by Bullinger as "the act of free-
ing or releasing; deliverance; redemption for one from
guilt and punishment, brought about by expiation. De-
liverance from the guilt and punishment of sin, and ap-
plying to the whole being, deliverance of the soul from
sin, and the body from the grave."
   2. IN listening to the words of Satan man lost his in-
nocence, his life, and his dominion. In this he fell under
condemnation. Before he disobeyed, he was innocent,
or free from condemnation. In Rom. 5 : i6 we read that
condemnation came upon man by sin. As soon as he
transgressed, he showed his loss of innocence by hiding
himself (Gen. 3 :8, to), and trembled when he heard the
word of the Lord. This condemnation has passed on
all (Rom. 5: 18), so that the whole world stands guilty
before God (Rom. 3:19). To be placed in his original
position before his Creator, man must be redeemed from
condemnation and death, and reinstated in his dominion.
   3. THE Jews expressed the whole compass of things by
6               THE COMING OF THE LORD.

" aleph " and " tau," the first and last letters of the He-
brew alphabet. But John was writing in the Greek, and
accommodates it to the Greek alphabet, of which "alpha"
and "omega" are the first and the last letters. By his
word Christ spoke the worlds into existence (Ps. 33:6-9);
and by the same word he upholds them. Heb. r:3. It
will be by the same word that he restores all things,
thus making Mm the beginning and ending of all things.



     LtESSON IL—April 8, 1893.
    THE WORK OF REDEMPTION—Continued.

    I. Review questions : —
     (a) What three things were lost in the fall?

  12. To what time do those who have the earnest
look? Rom. 8:23.
  13. When will the body be redeemed? 1 Cor.

dergo? Phil. 3:20, 2 1 .
  15. Then what Bible subject ought to be of great
interest to every child of faith? Ans.—The com-
ing of the Lord.
  16. What will the scriptures on this subject be to
the believer? See note 2.
   17. Then what should we do? John 5: 39. See
note 3.

                        NOTES.
  I. WE have Christ in the heart by faith, and faith co►n-
eth by the word of God; therefore, we can only know
that we are Christ's by this word that abideth in us.
John 15:7; Gal. 5 :22, 23; Rom. 8: 16.
  2. THE Saviour said unto his disciples, "The words
that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life."
This is true of all the words he spake, and therefore
8               THE COMING OF THE LORD.

true of those words he spake concerning his second com-
ing. When he comes, he will give life to all the dead, and
remove all corruption from those who have kept the
pledge he left with them when he redeemed them from
sin. When we study his words on this subject, they
should indeed be life to us.
  3. THIS text is often used by Bible students as a com-
mand. But by reading the Revised Version we per-
haps get a .better understanding   a  its meaning: "Ye.
search the Scriptures, because ye think that in them ye
have eternal life; and these are they which bear witness
of me."

10              THE COMING OF THE LORD.

                          NOTES.
   I. IN John 6 : 63 we learn that the words of Christ are
spirit and life. Then, when his word abides in us
(t John 3:24), and our lives answer to that word as the
reflection in the mirror does to the face, we are assured
that we have the witness, or testimony, for the word is
the Spirit's testimony that we are children of God.
   2. THE original word is much stronger than our English
word: " Receiving a portion, especially of an inherit-
ance; as substantive, an heir, one who has a lot (not
one to whom a lot is allotted, because it is derived
from the active; but), he who has the inheritance, the
stress being laid on the possession."—Bullinger. A
joint heir is one who is in partnership with another in the
inheritance; man lost the dominion, or inheritance;
Christ gave his life to redeem it, and man, by accepting
him, becomes an heir with him.
   3. RABBI LESSER'S English Translation of the Old
Testament reads: "And thou, 0 Tower of the flocks, the
Stronghold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall go,
and shall come, the former dominion, the kingdom be-
longing to the daughter of Jerusalem."
   4. By comparing Micah 4 :8 with Ps. 45 : 9, to; Songs
5 :8, we must conclude that the term " daughters" refers
to the believers, or the flock. Christ is often spoken of
as the Shepherd of the flock. See John To :7, 16.

                         NOTES.
  I. PETER said that the time of restoration of all things
was spoken of by all the prophets since the world began.
By carefully studying the prophetic scriptures, it will be
noticed that the Lord very frequently reminds his people
of a judgment day when the Lord would cut off the
wicked and give the faithful an inheritance in the new
earth.
  2. THE Scriptures everywhere teach that God hath ap-
pointed a judgment day (Acts r7:31), when every man
shall give an account of all that he has done (Eccl. 12 :
14. ; 2 Cor. 5: ro). They also teach that all the dead are
to be raised from their graves (John 5 : 28, 29), to receive
their rewards, and that these great events are connected
with the second coming of the Lord (2 Tim. 4 : I ; Rev.
22:12).

—Great Controversy, page 644.
  2. IT would be impossible to have a literal reward if
Christ's coming was secret. If no one knew when he
had come, they would not know whether they had the
reward or not.

jests have ceased. Lying lips are hushed into silence;
the clash of arms, the tumult of battle, with confused

Naught now is heard but the voice of prayer and the
sound of weeping and lamentation. The cry bursts
forth from lips so lately scoffing, ' The great day of His
wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand? ' The
wicked pray to be buried beneath the rocks of the moun-
tains, rather than meet the face of Him whom they have
despised and rejected."—Great Controversy, page 642.

                           NOTES.
  I. PROPHECY     is history written before it is made. God,
who knows the end from the beginning, speaks through
his prophets to the world, that they may know what is
coming in the future, and be prepared to meet it. The
Saviour often spoke of himself as fulfilling the words of
the prophets concerning his work. Had the people
given heed to the prophetic Scripture, they would not
have rejected him. So in the lase days they that study
the word of prophecy and believe it will be in the light,
while those who reject this word will be lost.
   2. "THAT no prophecy of the Scripture, whether that
referred to above, or any other, is of any private interpre-
tation, proceeds from the prophet's own knowledge or
invention, or was the offspring of calculation or conjec-
ture. The word 'epilusis' signifies, also, impetus, im-
pulse,.and probably this is the best sense here—not by
mere private impulse of his own mind."— Clarke.
   3. IN I Peter r : If we •learn that it was the Spirit of
Christ that was in the prophets that led them to speak
the words they spake. In the opening words of the
book of Revelation, we are informed that it is a "revela-
tion of Jesus Christ," which he sent through his angel to
John. This angel tells John (Rev. 22:9) that he was the
fellow-servant of John and the other prophets before him.
Then every prophet was instructed by Christ's angel,
and Jesus himself was the authority for all that was
spoken.
   4. "BY some of the ancients a generation was fixed at
 a hundred years, by others at a hundred and ten years,
 by others at thirty-three, thirty-five, and even at twenty
 years. So that there was nothing uniform and settled in
 this matter."—Cruden. " Genea, birth, race, descent,
 offspring; it denotes an age, or generation from the point
 of view of race."—Bullinger.

  17. When was the sign in the moon fulfilled?
See note 6.
  18. What did Jesus exhort his people to do when
they saw these things begin to come to pass?
Luke 21:28.

                         NOTES.
   I. THERE have been a great many tribulations through
which God's people have had to pass. If the Saviour
had only spoken of a tribulation, we should have been
at a loss to know which one he meant. But he connects
with it three specifications that locate it beyond a doubt;
first, it is a great tribulation; second, there never was one
like it before, nor ever will be another like it again;
20              THE COMING OF THE LORD.

third, there is a certain time called " days " allotted
to it.
   2. THERE is one persecution, and only one, that meets
the demands of the Saviour's words, and that is found in
the papal persecution, from A. D. 538 to 1798. It was
great in extent and severity. There never was a time
when so many of God's people sealed their testimony
with their blood. About fifty million people suffered
martyrdom at the hands of this power. According to
other prophecies it was to have authority over the saints
for "time, times, and dividing of times" (Dan. 7:25; Rev.
12:14); twelve hundred and sixty days (Rev. 12:6); or
forty-two months (Rev. 13:5), which literally signifies
twelve hundred and sixty years. See " Thoughts on
Daniel and the Revelation."
  3. THE days began with the subjection of the Ostro-
goths in A. D. 538, and, continuing twelve hundred and
sixty years, would close A. D. 1798, when the Papacy as a
persecutor was overthrown.
  4. THE empress of Austria was the first European
ruler to issue an edict of tolerance to Christianity, which
took place in A. D. 1776. Owing to the work of the re-
formers, persecution ceased in the other States about the
same time.
  5. " IN the month of May, 1780, there was a terrific dark
day in New England, `when all faces seemed to gather
blackness,' and the people were filled with fear. There
was great distress in the village where Edward Lee lived,
`men's hearts failing them for fear' that the judgment
day was at hand; and the neighbors all flocked around
the holy man, who spent the gloomy hours in earnest
prayer for the distressed multitude."—American Tract
Society, Tract No. 379, Life of Edward Lee. " Candles
were lighted in many houses, birds were silent and dis.
               THE COMING -OF THE LORD.              21

appeared, fowls retired to roost. It was the general
opinion that the day of judgment was at hand."—Presi-
dent Dwight, in Connecticut Historical Collection.
  6. THE evening that followed the dark day which
should have had the light of a full moon, was shrouded
in inky darkness. In the latter part of the night, the
moon was visible, but had the appearance of blood.
See Rev. 6:12.

  17. What expression is used that shows the com-
ing of the Lord very near? Luke 21:32. See

  18. Then what may we expect within the pres-

  19. What will he do when he appears? Matt.
24:31.
                          NOTES.
   I. "Tins language of the prophet (Rev. 6:13) has al-
ways been received as metaphorical. Yesterday it was
literally fulfilled. • The ancients understood by ' aster'
                THE COMING OF THE LORD.                  23

in Greek and stella ' in Latin the smaller lights of
heaven. The refinement of modern astronomy has made
the distinction between stars of heaven and meteors of
heaven. Therefore, the idea of the prophet as it is ex-
pressed in the original Greek, was literally fulfilled in the
phenomena of yesterday."—Henry Dana Ward, in Jour-
nal of Commerce, November 15, 1833.
   2. "THE meteoric phenomenon which occurred on the
morning of the 13th of November last, was of so extraor-
dinary and interesting a character as to be entitled to
more than a mere passing notice. . . . The lively
and graphic descriptions which have appeared in various
public journals do not exceed the reality. No language,
indeed, can come up to the splendor of that magnificent
display, and I hesitate not to say that no one who
did not witness it can form an adequate conception of its
glory. It seemed as if the whole starry heavens had
congregated at one point near the zenith, and were simul-
taneously shooting forth, with the velocity of lightning,
to every part of the horizon, and yet they were not ex-
hausted, thousands swiftly following in the track of thou-
sands, AS IF CREATED FOR THE OCCASION."— Christian
Advocate and Journal, Dec. 13, 1833.
   3. THERE is a record of not less than sixteen star show-
ers between 902 and 1868 A. D. None of those previous
to 1780 could be the one referred to by the Saviour.
Since that date we have a record of six of these showers
that have been noticed in different parts of the world.
The skeptic may ask, " How can you know which of
these is the fulfillment of the prophecy?" This is easily
determined by reading Rev. 6 : 13. It is the one in which
 the stars fall as untimely figs. This was true only of the
one in 1833. The astronomers speak of the shower of
1833 as the most important one that has yet been seen.
   4. WE have a ' record of more disastrous storms and
A4              THE COMING OF THE LORD.

 fires, extraordinary sights in the heavens, and famines
 and pestilences within the last half century than has ever
 been seen in the same length of time before. There may
 have been times when some ONE of these may have been
 greater, but, taking the combination, it can be truly said
 that there has never yet been a half century that contained
so many destructive agencies which were at work at the
same time to bring distress upon the earth. See "Facts
for the Times," pp. 134-136.
   5. "THE tidal disturbances are the most remarkable
and extensive of which there is any record. It is said
their velocity was about ONE THOUSAND MILES AN HOUR.
 Both the great ocean waters of the Atlantic and Pacific
have been agitated in their whole extent. We mention
in particular the tidal waves at St. Thomas and all the
neighboring islands, which were FULL FIFTY FEET IN*
HEIGHT. . . . It is said by those who have witnessed
these waves that the ocean's ROAR IS EXCEEDINGLY
FRIGHTFUL."—New York Tribune of Nov. 12, 1868.
See " Facts for the Times," pp. 149, 15o.
   6. " IN the education of the intellect mankind has
made great strides since the birth of this century.
Whether we regard the number taught or the knowledge
imparted, the progress made has been marvelous."—
Horace Greeley.
   7. REAPER and mower, 1833; telegraph, electrotype,

light and sewing machine, 1846; submarine cable, 1851;
telephone, 1876; phonograph, 1877; audiphone, 1881.
   8. FROM the record in Matthew 24, it might be inferred
that the period spoken of as "this generation" might
begin with the darkening of the sun; but when we com-
pare this with the record of Luke 21, we see that the gen-
eration must begin later than the darkening of the sun.

He mentions the sun, moon, and stars, then adds, "And
upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity, the
sea and the waves roaring, men's hearts failing them for
fear and for looking after those things that are coming
upon the earth." Then he says, "When ye see these
things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up
your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh." The
beginning of the signs was seen in the sun, moon, and
it may be the falling of the stars. After speaking of the
figure, he says: " So likewise ye, when ye see these things
come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is nigh
at hand."

by excessive eating and drinking; second, to overfeed,
and produce sickness or uneasiness."—Webster.
   2. "Goo bestowed upon these antediluvians many
rich gifts, but they used his bounties to glorify themselves,
and turned them into a curse by fixing their affections
upon the gifts instead of the Giver. They employed the
gold and silver, the precious stones, and the choice wood,
in the construction of habitations for themselves, and
endeavored to excel one another in beautifying their
dwellings with the most skillful workmanship. They
sought only to gratify the desires of their own proud
hearts, and reveled in scenes of pleasure and wicked-
ness."—Patriarchs and Prophets, IV. 9o, 91.
   3. " IN Sodom there was mirth and revelry, feasting
and drunkenness. The vilest and most brutal passions
were unrestrained. The people openly defied God and his
law, and delighted_ in deeds of violence."—Ibid,
   4. "AT the time of Lot's removal to Sodom, corruption
had not become universal, and God, in his mercy, per-
mitted rays of light to shine amid the moral darkness.
When Abraham rescued the captives from the Elamites,
 the attention of the people was called to the true faith."

                        NOTES.
  I. THE term "gospel" signifies good news. The gospel
of the kingdom would mean the good news of the king-
dom. The kingdom is associated with the second advent
of Jesus Christ. Compare 2 Tim. 4:1; Luke 21 :31; with
Matt. 24 : 33. Therefore to preach the gospel of the king-
80              THE COMING OF THE LORD.

dom, in the sense of Matt. 24 : 14, would mean to preach
the second coming of the Saviour.
  2. THE Bible has been translated into more than two
hundred languages and dialects, and there are but few
nations who have not heard the sound of this gospel.
In a few of these nations the sound of the good news of
the coming kingdom has gone but faintly, but the people
are calling for someone to come and instruct them. The
Lord has prepared the nations to receive the everlasting
gospel, and is now calling for his people to go forth and
sound it with a loud cry.

  20. What should be the message for such a time?
Rev. 18:4.
  21. What should be the character of those who
give the message? Rev. 14: 12; 2 Peter 3:14.

                          NOTES.
   I. THE word "Babylon" is from Babel, which means
confusion. When applied to a body of professors, would
signify that they were not united in the faith they held. By
studying Rev. 14:6-12 it will be seen that the term is
applied to a people that live just before the Lord comes.
See verse 14. They have not only become confused as
to what the true faith is, but, by unlawful connection with
the world, they have fallen from what they know to be
right. Dr. Adam Clarke expresses their condition in his
comments on 2 Tim. 3: 5, when he says, " Who have all
their religion in their creed, confession of faith, etc., while
they may be destitute of the life of God in their souls."
There are several hundred denominations in the land
that profess to take the Bible as the foundation of their
faith; yet each one condemns all the rest, showing a state
of confusion that turns sinners from the word of God.
With their confusion they have so far retrograded from
their original that it can be truthfully said, " Babylon is
fallen."
  2. ALTHOUGH the world denounces the fallen state of
the church in the last days, God has not yet taken his Spirit
wholly from them. He at one time blessed them, because
they were living up to the light they had. Then they
brought sinners into the fold and were blessed in their
work. But in turning to the world, the honest-hearted
ones are still there, but do not enjoy the state of things
they see. Finally the Spirit will be withdrawn.

                          NOTES.
   z. "THAT the expression bottomless pit' represents
the earth in a state of confusion and darkness is evident
from other scriptures. Concerning the condition of the
earth ' in the beginning' the Bible record says that it was
without farm and void; and darkness was upon the face
of the deep' (Gen. i :2); the word here translated deep'
is the same that in Rev. zo :1-3 is rendered bottomless
pit.' Prophecy teaches thg it will be brought back,
partially,at least, to this condition. Looking forward to
the great day of God, the prophet Jeremiah declares: ' I
beheld the earth, and lo, it was without form, and void;
and the heavens, and they had no light.' "—Great Con-
troversy, N. 658, 659.
   2. " HERE iS to be the home of Satan with his evil
angels for a thousand years. Limited to the earth, he
 will not have access to other worlds, to tempt and annoy
those who have never fallen. It is in this sense that he
is bound; there are none remaining upon whom he can
                THE COMING OP THE LORD.

exercise his power. He is wholly cut off from the work
of deception and ruin, which for so many centuries has
been his sole delight."— Ibid.
   3. " DURING the thousand years between the first and
second resurrection, the judgment of the wicked takes
place. The Apostle Paul points to this judgment as an
event that follows the second advent. 1 Cor. 4 :5.
Daniel declares that when the. Ancient of Days came,.
 `judgment was given to the saints of the Most High.'
Dan. 7 : 22. At this time the righteous reign as kings and
priests unto God."—Bid, pp. 66o, 661.
   4. " THE time has come to which holy men have looked
with longing, since the flaming sword barred the first pair
from Eden, the time for ' the redemption of the purchased
possession.' Micah 4: 8. The earth originally given to
man as his kingdom, betrayed by him into the hands of
Satan, and so long held by the mighty foe, has been
brought back by the great plan of redemption. All that
was lost by sin has been restored. Isa. 45 :18. God's
original purpose in the creation of the earth is fulfilled,
asst is made the eternal abode of the redeemed. Ps.
37 : 29."--/bid, p. 674.

PROPHETIC LIGHTS. By E. J. Waggoner. As its title in-
      dicates, it treats of some of the leading prophecies both
     of the Old and New Testaments, showing the exact ful-
