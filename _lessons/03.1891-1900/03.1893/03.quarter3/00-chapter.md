Some Important Works
PROPHETIC LIGHTS. By E. J. Waggoner. As its title in-
     dicates, it treats of some of the leading prophecies both
 •. of the Old and New Testaments, showing the exact ful-
     fillment of the predictions of the Bible concerning Egypt,
 •. Tyre, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, and Rome ; also of
 •. the prophecies concerning the first advent of Christ,
     which proves the inspiration of the Bible, and gives as-
     surance that other prophecies which are noted will as
 •. surely and exactly be fulfilled. Nearly all the illustrations
     of this book were designed and engraved especially for
 •. this work at great expense and are a study in themselves.
 •. Heavy paper covers, 50c; Cloth, gilt edges, $1.00.
STEPS TO CHRIST. By Mrs. E. G. White. The rare abil-
       ity of the author in the presentation of the Scripture truth
  •. has never been used to greater advantage than in this lit-
       tle work. "Steps to Christ" is not alone suitable as a
       guide to the inquirer and young convert, but is rich in
  •. thought and suggestion for the most mature Christian.
       Cloth, 75c.

First Epistle of Peter.
           FOR SENIOR CLIESSES.
     u13, 1 to September 30, 1890.

                INTRODUCTORY NOTE.
   THE plan of these lessons will not be greatly different
from that of the first quarter of 1893. The lesson scrip-
ture is sometimes divided and the principal topic of the
division named where it has seemed advisable. The main
questions are suggestive of the study of the book proper.
The principal and most profitable doctrines and truths
suggested in the lesson are developed more fully in the
notes, which will furnish every live teacher with basis
sufficient for as long a lesson as is desired. It is earnestly
hoped that what has thus far been learned of the word of
God and the power of the Spirit in that word will be
brought into these lessons. There may be much worthy
of criticism in the style of the lessons, but let the mind
of the student be attent to the word of God, with an ear-
nest desire to hear, believe, and do, and he will be richly
 rewarded in spiritual growth.

                       NOTES.
  1. THE expression in the first verse, "strangers scat-
tered," is in the Revised Version "sojourners of the
               THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER.                   5

 dispersion," and because of this expression thought by
 many to refer to Israel according to the flesh; but while
 believing Jews are doubtless included, it is very evident
 that the epistle is addressed and comes with peculiar
 force to Gentile believers. See chapter 2 : ro. As we
 proceed in the study of the epistle, it will be seen that
 while it has' been a blessing to the church through all the
 past, it has special application and force in the last days.
 See chapter 1 :13; 4: 7, 12, 13, 17.
    2. THE elect of God primarily is Christ himself (Isa.
42 : i), and all those who are Christ's are therefore also
 the elect of God. They are chosen before the foundation
 of the world (Eph. 1 : 4), according to the foreknowledge
 of God (I Peter i : 2), chosen to be holy and without
 blame (Eph. I :.4), chosen to salvation (2 Thess. 2 : 13; 2
 Tim. 2 : ro), chosen through the belief of the truth, the
 sanctification of the Spirit, and the sprinkling of the
 blood of Jesus (2 Thess. 2 :13; I Peter 1 : 2).
    3. FAITH is based upon God's word. God says it;
 faith says it is so, and so it is. Hope is based on God's
 promise. The one all-embracing promise of God is that
 relating to the seed, Jesus Christ. (See Gen. 3 : 15; 13 :
16; 22 : 17, 18, and other passages.) This hope centers
 in Christ, his death and resurrection. To this Paul re-
 fers as " the hope of the promise made of God unto our
 fathers" (Acts 26 : 6). This hope included the resurrec-
 tion of the dead (verse 8; 24 :15); it was the " hope of Is-
•rael" (28 : 20); it is the hope of the Lord's coming (Titus
  2: 13), of eternal life (3: 7), of salvation (1 Thess. 5 :8),
 of the incorruptible inheritance (I Peter 1 : 4); it is the
  hope of the gospel (Col. I : 23), Christ our hope (I Tim.
  I :1), Christ in you the hope of glory (Col. 1 : 27). We
  are begotten again unto that hope by the word of the
  gospel (I Peter I : 23; James I : 18), but that word of the
  gospel is the Living Word, our Lord Jesus Christ, who
6             THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER.

demonstrated his power over sin and death by his resur-
rection (Acts 2 : 24). This hope in Christ is therefore a
"living hope," ever growing brighter, bigger, stronger,
as we appropriate the living word.
  4. Trial of Your Faith.—Every day brings its trials of
faith, every temptation puts faith to thP test; but to him
who has genuine faith there is never any more danger of
faith's failing under the one test than another. It mat-
ters not how great the test; power awaits on faith suffi-
cient for every need. It is not a matter of the strength
of the person tempted, or the strength of the temptation
brought; it is a matter of simple faith in Christ. Faith
puts Christ in our place, and Christ is equally able to meet
all the armies of Satan as one of his lowest minions. He
who thus endures temptation proves in every trial that
his faith is genuine, a precious experience indeed here,
but more precious when found unto praise and glory and
honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
  5. Love.—Faith begets love by continually proving
God to be what he is. The Christian therefore knows
Christ, though having never seen him. Faith has brought
him into the heart (Eph. 3 : 17), put him into the life (Gal.
2 zo), and proved him to be love in all places, under all
circumstances, and the soul loves him with an ever-grow-
ing love. Again, the Spirit of God is given to those who
ask in faith (Luke II : 9-13; Gal. 3 : 14), and to the sons
of God (Gal. 4: 6), and by that Spirit is the "love of God
shed abroad in the heart " (Rom. 5 : 5).


       LESSON IL-July 8, 1893.
    THE GREAT SALVATION. 1 Peter 1 : 10-16.

    REVIEW QUESTIONS. — (a) What does faith do
for us?    (6) What is the character of the joy
             THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER.                7

which it gives? (c) What graces are connected'
with this faith? (d) What is its end?
I. What the Prophets Revealed. Verses 10-12,
   i. Who before us inquired diligently of this
        salvation?
   2. Of what did they prophesy?
   3. Does this mean that the prophets did not
        know of God's salvation and grace?
        Note r.
   4. Why did they search their own writings?
   5. To what did the Spirit through their writings
        testify?
   6. What did God reveal in answer to their in-
        quiries?
   7. What other beings desire to look into these
        things?
11. Practical Applications. Verses 13-16.
    z. In view of what God has thus revealed, what
          should we do? Note 2.
    2. Like whom should we act?
    3. Against what are we admonished?
    4. After whom should we be fashioned?
    5. How is it possible for us to be holy? Note 3.

                        NOTES.
  J. Have Inquired.—The holy men of old certainly
knew the salvation of Christ personally. (See Gen. 49
18; Ex. t5: 2; Ps. 9: 14; 51 : 12.) In fact, the whole in-
spired psalmody of Israel breathes of the salvation of
God, both present and future. Yet they did not under-
8             THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER.


stand the plan of salvation in its fuller development, as
did and do those of the Christian era. This is expressly
declared in the scripture (verse 12), in the prophets
themselves (Dan. 12 : 4, 9), by Christ (Matt. 13 : 16, 17), by
the apostles (Rom. i6 : 25, 26; Eph. 3 : 5); but this under-
standing was not necessary, for God by his Spirit spoke
through them things which they did not know nor under-
stand. They were the instruments; it was the Spirit of
Christ which was in them that testified, not the prophets
themselves. The Spirit of God knows the mind and
thoughts of God (t Cor. 2 : II), and therefore it was nec-
essary that the Spirit of God must give the words which
should convey the thoughts of God to future generations
(2 Sam. 23 : 2; see also i Cor. 2 : 13; 2 Tim. 3 : 16; 2 Peter
  : 2).
      THE Revised Version gives a thought in the render-
ing of this verse which ought to be considered in its
study; it reads: " Wherefore girding up the loins of your
mind, be sober and set your hope perfectly on the grace
that is being brought [marginal, Greek] unto you at the
revelation of Jesus Christ." Note, the "girding" is not
a single act, but a constant work, a; binding up with the
truth of God (Eph. 6 : 14), as that truth is constantly re-
vealed in the onward path of the Christian (Phil. 3 : 15,
16). And note also that this grace is not all future, but
is constantly flowing from a full fountain to which we have
access by faith (Rom. 5 : 2), as Christ is revealed to us
more and more in his word; for to the faithful Christian
student of the word is constantly revealed new manifesta-
tions of the glory of the Master (2 Cor. 4 : 6), which will
increase from glory to glory (2 Cor. 3 : i8), until the day
of the revealing of the glory of his presence (2 Thess. I :
7, to; 2 : 8), when his people shall be made like him (Phil.
3 :20, 21; I John 3 : 2).
44.x   Be Ye Holy.—The Revised Version puts the ex-
               THE FIRST EPISTLE OP PETER.                  9

pression both as a command and declaration. " Like as
He which called you is holy, be yourselves also holy in
all manner of living, because it is written, Ye shall be
holy, for I am holy." See Lev. 19 : 2. God commands
impossibilities for us of ourselves. He says, " Be ye
holy;" but of ourselves we have no holiness about us.
" We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteous-
nesses are as filthy rags " (Isa. 64 : 6); but he who called us
is holy, and as he called us in our uncleanness to holiness
   Thess. 4 : 7; Eph. i: 4), Christ sanctified or made holy
himself that we might be holy (John 17 : 19), and to those
who submit to him, he cleanses from all their pollution
and gives .a new heart and new spirit (Eze. 36 : 25-27),
created in righteousness and true holiness (Eph. 4: 24);
and being made free from the power of sin, we have, by
God's grace, fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting
life (Rom. 6 : 22), so the expression, " Ye shall be holy, for
I am holy," is a pledge of God's holiness and power that,
if we will but submit to him; we shall be established un-
 blamable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the
coming of our Lord Jesus Christ (r Thess. 3 : 13). Our
part is to submit to God's plan, to yield to his holy con-
 ditions; God, by the Spirit of holiness and his word, does
 the work.

  BOUGHT WITH A PRICE. 1 Peter 1:17-25.


   REVIEW QUESTIONS. —(a) How should we be
fashioned? (b) Who alone can thus transform us?
(c) Upon what conditions will he do it?
10           THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER.

1. Our Redemption. Verses 17-21.
    I. What characteristic is here given of God?
    2. According to what does he judge?
    3. In view of this how should we live?
    4. From what has God redeemed us? Note T.
    5. With what price did he redeem us?

    2. What feeling toward the brethren did this
         produce?
    3. That we may grow and be confirmed in that
         love, what injunction did he give?

    8. What is this living word declared to be?

                        NOTES.
  I. Conversation.—This word, found in verse 15 of the
last lesson and verse i8 of this (see also 2:12; 3: 1, 2),
means the whole course of conduct, manner of lire, be-
havior. See the Revised Version. This is what con-
versation meant in English when the Bible was translated,
and is so used now in some instances, but in most cases
is applied to common talking among persons. Let the
student understand that, while it is not confined to speech,

it includes that as a part of the "manner of life." From
the vain worldly manner of life God has redeemed us to
a new manner of life, even his own.
  2. Purified in Obeying the Truth.—This text is a
parallel to Acts 15:9, "purifying their hearts by faith."
The faith is faith in the cleansing, purifying word ( John
15:31; the obedience is the obedience of faith (Rom.
16 :26) to the word or truth of the gospel. The cleans-
ing power in the word is the Spirit of God. Compare
with I Peter I:2 and 2 Thess. 3:13.



     LESSON IV.-July 22, 1893.
  THE CHIEF CORNER STONE. 1 Peter 2 : 1-8.

  REVIEW QUESTIONS. — (a) By faith in what are
we purified? (b) By what are we begotten? (c)
What is its character? (d) What is this word?
I. Feeding on the Word. Verses 1 -3.
    1. What do those begotten of God's word and
         born of his Spirit put away?
    2. For what are they to long? and why?
    3. Who will thus desire to feed upon God's
         word?
11. Built on Christ. Verses 4-8.
    I. What is the condition of stones as regards
         life? Note I.
    2. To what is Christ the Lord likened?

12            THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER.


      4. How did God regard him?
      5. As Christ is the elect, living stone of God,
            what are those who are Christ's?
      6. Into what are we, as lively (living) stones,
            built? Note 2.
      7. What precious assurance does he quote from
            Isaiah?
      8. How is Christ, the corner stone, regarded
            by believers?
      9. To whom does he prove a stone of stumbling
            and a rock of offense?
     10. Why do these two classes regard him so
            differently?

                        NOTES.
   i. Lively Stones. —Better, " living stones." The
Child of God is ever represented by something which
has life, and implies action. He is the soldier on duty
(Eph. 6: 13), the contender in the games (1 Cor. 9:24),
the pilgrim traveler (Heb. u:13), a living branch of the
True Vine (John 15:5); he is to grow (Eph. 4: 15), to
walk (Eph. 4:1), to run (Heb. 12:1), to fight the fight of
faith (I Tim. 6:12), to watch, to work, etc., etc.; and
when an inanimate object is taken to represent the Chris-
tian, like a stone, that object is given life. This life
comes from Christ, the living Rock, on which believers as
stones are builded, receiving life from the foundation,
Christ (1 Cor. 3:11; Gal. 2:20). They thus become
welded or grown to the rock connected with the one life.
The object of this building is said to be to offer up spir-
itual sacrifices acceptable to God. All that makes any-
thing acceptable to God is that Christ shall be in it, and
if Christ is in us, and we in him, the praises and prayers
              THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER.               13

of his people, the sacrifices for his sake, their labors of
love, in fact, the very life, are all acceptable in the Be-
loved. (See Hos. 14:1; Mal. r: II; Rom. 12:1; Heb.
13 :,15, 16.)
   2. To THE believer Christ is the precious foundation.
To the unbeliever, or disobedient (for the terms are syn-
onymous, see Revised Version), he is a stone of stum-
bling. The same sun and rain which ripen and develop
the wheat, also ripen and develop the tares and weeds.
The latter class stumble because they will not obey; they
do not wish to do God's will. " Who is wise, and he shall
understand these things? prudent, and he shall know
them? for the ways of the Lord are right, and the just
shall walk in them; but the transgressors shall fall
therein." Hosea 14: 9. The earnest student of prophecy
will find added interest in this lesson by a diligent study
of Isa. 28: 14-22. This scripture has especial force to the
 last days. When God's judgments sweep away the
 refuge of lies, and the house builded on the sand is over-
 thrown, blessed indeed will those be who have "digged
 deep," and laid their foundation on the Rock Christ
Jesus. Luke 6:47-49, Revised Version.



      LESSON V.-July 29, 1893.
     THE CHOSEN PEOPLE. 1 Peter 2:9-16.

   REVIEW QuEsTioNs.—(a) By what are Chris-
tians begotten? (b) Upon what are they to feed
in order to grow? (c) Upon whom are they built?
(d) Thus builded what are they?
14           THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER.

1. The Call. Verses 9, 10.
    i. What are those called who are builded upon
         Christ?
    2. For what purpose are they called, chosen,
         crowned, separated, purchased?
    3. What was their former condition?
11. An Earnest Exhortation. Verses 11, 12.
    I. With what earnest words does the Lord ex-
         hort his people?
    2. What should be their conversation (conduct)
        among the Gentiles?
    3. What would be the result of such a life?
M. Civil Duties. Verses 13-16.
   I. What is the Christian's duty as regards the
        laws of men? Note.
   2. From what motive, and for whose sake,
        should it be done?
   3. Does this include obedience to laws which
        conflict with God's law?
   4. When we obey our rulers in the exercise of
        rightful authority, what will be the result?
  5. Should this obedience be rendered as servants
        of men?

                        NOTE.
  WHEN rulers enact foolish or oppressive laws, espe-
cially in a republic, they are frequently spoken of with
disrespect and contempt by the people. Such examples
often become contagious; but Christians should not thus
allow themselves to be carried away by bad examples;
              Tim'   FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER.             lu


and all laws, needless and oppressive though they may
be, should be obeyed with faithfulness unless they con-
travene God's laws. In such case only may we refuse to
obey.
   All such expressions as these in our lesson pertain to
proper laws, and to such only as rulers have a right to
make. "Render unto Cxsar the things that are Cmsar's,
and unto God the things that are God's." To God be-
longs everything which pertains to his worship or service
as commanded in his word, or conceived by the con-
science. The civil duties between man and man, and
the duty of man to support the State, have nothing to
do with religion. Daniel was prime minister in an idola-
trous empire, and was obedient to all civil laws, but he
could not obey a law which would compel him to dis-
honor God. Dan. 6:4-23. The three young Hebrews,
high in position, faithful in all civil duties, could not do
otherwise than refuse to dishonor God by not obeying
the king's command to bow down before the golden
image. Dan. 3:8-18. See also Acts 4:19 and 5 : 29.
The matter Of obedience to laws which deny or dishonor
God is not a matter of "will not," or "would not," but
of "cannot," and "could not." The Christian can die
 easier than he can dishonor God.

    i. How should all souls be regarded? and why?
          Note i.
    2. How should we regard the children of God?
    3. What should be our attitude toward God?

    5. Who is an example to us in this respect?
    6. In all his unjust suffering, what character did
          he manifest?
    7. What did his faith lead him to do?
    8. For what purpose were all these sufferings?
    9. What do these do for every sinner who be-
          lieves?
   io. What is said of the past and present of our
          lives? Verse 25; Ps. 23:r.

                        NOTES.
 I. THE practical duties enjoined in this lesson are those
which are very apt to be overlooked. Honor All Men.
             THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER.               17

—"Some are not worthy of honor," says one; neither are
we. We are by nature the same as they (Eph. 2:3; Ps.
51:5); all were made originally in the likeness.of the
same God as much as we (James 3: 9); all are bought by
the same precious blood of Christ (t Tim. 2:6); all are
therefore for Christ's sake entitled to the same esteem
and.honor. Love the Brotherhood.—A closer, deeper
affection than for all men, bound together by the life and
presence of Christ (John 17: 23). Fear God.—The fear
of the Lord, not cringing or slavish fear, but loving rev-
erence, is the foundation of wisdom. He who knows
God most, fears and loves him most. Honor the King.
—Under God he is your ruler; honor his office and respect
his authority. See verse 15 of the lesson chapter.
  2. Servants.—We are all servants, servants of God
and the Lord Jesus Christ. He was misunderstood, un-
appreciated, scorned, maligned, crucified; so will we be.
Let us do our work faithfully wherever we labor, with all
fear of God, not with eye service as men pleasers, but as
doing service to God, and not to man. Eph. 6: 5-7. A
bad servant will many times be patient under a gentle
master, but it is only the true, and tried, and loyal to
God, who will be patient and true under the froward
master. If done for Christ's sake, of Christ will he re-
ceive the reward. We are called to thus suffer and deny
ourselves. See Matt. 16:24; Acts 14:22; 2 Tim. 3:12.

          met?
    3. What does God design that such opposition
          shall bring us?
    4. What instructions are given him who loves
          life and good days?
    5. How is the only way to seek peace?—Ab-
          solute submission and faith in God.
          Rom. 5: I.
               THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER.                 19

                          NOTES.
   z. Wives, Husbands.—Such instructions as are here
given are frequently laughed at or sneered about even
by those who profess the name of Christ. An unwise,
overbearing husband has pressed them too far, or an
obstinate, self-willed, worldly-minded wife has rebelled
against them; but it is well to remember that these
words are the words of God, to be listened to or studied
with reverence, knowing that we must meet them in
the judgment. Subjection to a husband does not mean
slavish homage, but the simple respect due to him whom
God and nature has placed first as head and protector
of the family. The very name husband—house-band—
indicates a binding together, not a lording over. Hus-
bands should love their wives as their own selves (Eph.
5: 25, 28), and should not be bitter against them (Col.
3: 19), dwelling with them not as objects of lust, or slaves to
their passions or whims, but according to the knowledge
revealed in the word of God and the condition of the
wife, giving them honor (1) because they are the weaker
sex, (2) because they are heirs together of the grace of
life. Wives are to submit to their husbands as is fit in
the Lord (Col. 3: i8), to defer to them in matters that do
not violate conscience or cause the wife to dishonor God,
never disparaging them in the eyes of their children or
others. She should be modest, prudent, economical.
If these feelings and affections exist, God will be honored,
and their united prayers put up to him for their children
and various blessings will not be hindered.
   2. Of One Mind.—The only way to be of one mind is
 to have the mind of Christ (Phil. 2 : 5); this mind will take
 possession of us when we fully renounce self and let
 Christ in; this unites us with Christ, and through
 Christ with one another (John 17 :27-23). Union of each
 soul with God is the only way possible to have union with
 one an9ther.

HI. Christ's Sufferings for Us. Verses 18-22.
    i. Who, though innocent, suffered for us?
    2. Why did he thus suffer?
    3. In what condition was he put to death? and
          how quickened?

    9. Through faith in what?
   10. What assurance is given us that Christ is
          able to save us from all that can come upon
          us?
                           NOTES.
   1. Who  Is He  That   Will  Harm You, etc. In a general
way this means that men will have no desire to harm those
who'are imitators of Christ, and under ordinary circum-
stances this has been true as promised (see Prov. 16 : 7),
but there are many exceptions to this general rule. But
even though we suffer persecution for righteousness' sake,
that will not work to our ultimate harm, though it causes
present sufferings; for to them that love God all things
work together for good ; even in the greatest sufferings
his followers are, through the love of God, more than
conquerors. See Rom. 8 : 28, 37. In the very sufferings
then they may find happiness and rejoice. See also
Matt. 5:11, 12.
   2. THE Revised Version makes the latter part of
verse 14 and the first part of verse 15 almost identical
 with the latter part of Isa. 8:12 and the first part of verse
             THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER.

13. Isaiah reads: "Neither fear ye their fear nor be
afraid. Sanctify the Lord of Hosts himself." Peter
reads : "Fear not their fear, neither be troubled; but
sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord." Isaiah tells us
in the next clause what the Lord will be to those who
trust in him. " He shall be for a sanctuary," • a safe
and holy place; for in the time of trouble God will
spread over us the pavilion of his power (Ps. 27 : 5 ; 34:
7), and hide us under the shadow of his wings (Ps. 17:
8), in the secret place of his tabernacle (Ps. 27 : 5).
   3. THE Spirit of Christ is given to every child-of his
(Rom. 8 : 9); and the gift of preaching is bestowed through
it (i Cor. 12 : 4); through that Spirit Christ has always
ministered to the souls in the prison house of sin (Isa.
61: t; Ps. 51 :12, 13). In the days of Noah that Spirit
spoke through the patriarch (2 Peter 2 : 5), who by faith
preached the message and saved his house (Heb. i 1 : 7).
As Noah by faith did what God enjoined, so we by bap-
tism show our faith in the death and resurrection of our
Lord Jesus Christ. It is not the baptism that saves, but
faith in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Baptism is the
manifestation of our faith, even as the baptism of Noah
in the ark by the deluge was the manifestation of his
faith in the power of God. It is not the mere act that
saves, not the physical washing, but faith in a risen Re-
deemer, which cleanses the conscience of its dead works.



    LESSON IX.—August 26, 1893.
        THE GODLY LIFE. 1 Peter 4:1:8.

  REVIEW QUESTIONS. —(a) What care has the
Lord for the righteous? (b) How should we regard
              TILE FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER.                28

the evil which may come upon us? (c) What great
example have we in this? (d) What is our duty in
view of such trouble?
1. Suffering with Christ. Verses 1-6.
    I. Who has suffered for us? Note.
    2. In view of this what should we do?
    3. What effect does God design that this suffer-
          ing shall have. on us?
    4. How should we regard our past life?
    5. How will the world regard this turning away
          from sin?          •
    6. What will they do?
    7. To whom must they give account?
    8. To whom may we commit our cause?
    9. What warning and privilege has God given
          all in view of the judgment?
   Positive Duties and Virtues. Verses 7, 8.
   1. What great event does the apostle declare to
         be at hand?
   2. What should we do in view of that event?
   3. What grace should we cherish above all
         others?
   4. What will this charity or love do?


                          NOTE. •
  Suffered in the Flesh.—Christ took upon himselt
the infirmities and sins of the flesh (Heb. 2 : I4 ; 4 : 15;
2 Cor. 5 : 21), but to every sin he died ; every lust he cru-
cified; every selfish desire he denied himself ; and all
for our sakes. We are to reckon ourselves dead unto
24            THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER.

sin (Rom. 6 : it), to put to death the passions and sins of
the flesh (Rom. 8 : 12, 13 ; Gal. 5 : 24), to deny ourselves
(Matt. i6 :24), to renounce all and follow him (Luke 14 :
33)• Thus dying to sin, in Christ we cease from sin and
live unto God. Rom. 6 : i i ; 7 : 4. And surely is not
the time past of our life sufficient for indulgence in all
these sins and lusts? Christ will take them all away, and
put in their place his own righteousness.



  LESSON X.—September 2, 1893.

 CHRISTIAN STEWARDSHIP. 1                Peter 4:9=11.

  REVIEW QUESTIONS.—(a) In view of what
should we arm ourselves to suffer? (b) What is
put to death in this suffering? (c) How will those

the end? (e) What is the crowning grace of the
Christian?
I. Hospitality. Verse 9.
     1. In what spirit should hospitality be ex-
           tended?

     3. What does Christ say of those who receive
           or reject even the least of his children?
           Matt. 25 :4o, 45.

     T. What has every man received? Note.
             THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER.               25

   2. From whom does he receive these gifts?
   3. Through what mighty Power?
   4. Name some of them.
   5. What are they called by our Lord?
   6. For how long were they given? For what
         purpose?
   7. To how many were they given?
   8. As everyone has received, how should' he
         use?
   9. Why is God's grace called " manifold "?
  10. How should he who aims to instruct speak?
  It. How should he who serves, minister?
  12. What will be the effect of this?

                          NOTE.
  THE Revised Version of I Peter 4 : to reads : "Ac-
cording as each bath received a gift, ministering it among
yourselves as good stewards of the manifold grace of
God." God's grace is here said to be manifold, because
manifested in so many ways in the church of God, even
as the many angled glass object reflects the light shining
upon it and through it. This grace comes through the
gracious Spirit of God (Eph. 4 : 7 ; m Cor. t2 : 4) ; these
gifts of God's Spirit are given to everyone who is
Christ's (Rom. 8:9;. Eph. 4: 7), to profit, or increase (i
Cor. 12 : 7), divided not according to the will of the man,
but the wisdom of the Spirit (i Cor. 12 : 11); these gifts
were bestowed upon the church when Jesus left this
world (Eph. 8), for the perfecting of the saints, for the
work of the ministry, for the building up of the body, or
church of Christ (verse 12); and these gifts will con-
tinue according to the measure of faith and consecration
26            THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER.

 of the church till the perfect day, or till Christ comes (1
 Cor. 13 :8--to ; Eph. 4 : 13). Some of these gifts are
 mentioned-in Rom. 12 : 6-8; I Cor. 12: 8-1o, 28; Eph. 4 :
  I.
   In Luke 19: 12-17 these gifts are by our Lord called
 pounds (the highest denomination of Roman money); in
 Matt. 25:14-30 they are called talents (the highest denom-
ination in Jewish money), thus showing their great value.
These talents and pounds are given by the same one
that gave the gifts, to the same ones, at the same time,
for the same purpose, to continue the same length of
time; they are therefore the same. The solemn impor-
tance of this stewardship is given in these parables; they
should be studied in connection with this lesson. Does
anyone think he has no gift? Let him be assured if he
is the Master's "own servant," he will be given accord-
ing to his ability to use. Matt. 25 : 14, 15. Ours is the
consecration; God is the giver.
   " The Lord calls for every talent and ability to be put
to use. When the reproach bf indolence and slothful-
ness shall have been wiped away from the church, the
Spirit of the Lord will be graciously manifested; divine
power will combine with human effort; the church will
see the providential interpositions of the Lord God of
hosts, the light of truth will be diffused, the knowledge of
God and of Jesus Christ whom he has sent."—Mrs. E.
G. W., in Conf. Bulletin, 1893, 215. 420.

                        NOTE.
   The Fiery Trial.—Our common version makes the
" fiery trial " future, but the Revised Version makes
it present. When the end is at hand (verse 7), when the
time is come for judgment to begin at the house of God
(verse 17), then, "beloved, think it not strange concern-
ing the fiery trial among you, which cometh upon you to
28            THE FIRST EPISTLE OF ',Erg&

prove you, as though a strange thing happened unto
you." These are a part of our heritage ; for "hereunto
were ye called " (chap. 2 : 21). The last days will be
days of especial peril (2 Tim. 3 :1); every wind of doc-
trine will be blowing (Eph. 4: it); men will put darkness
for light and light for darkness (Isa. 5:20); false prophets
will do great signs and wonders, to deceive if possible the
elect of God (Mark 13: 22); Satan himself will appear as
an angel of light and his ministers as ministers of right-
eousness (2 Cor. tt : 14, 15); persecution will break forth
upon those who honor God's law in the gospel of Christ
(Rev. : 17 ; 13 : 1.--17); Satan will work with all power
and signs and lying wonders (2 Thess. 2 : 9-12) ; in short,
every delusion of the past, "every device of the devil
adapted for the present, a very flood of iniquity and per-
secution, will roll in upon the world and the people of
God in these days of peril (Isa. 59:19), culminating in the
hour of temptation such as the world has never before
seen (Rev. 3:1o). These are the perils.
   On the other hand, the Lord Jesus Christ, who con-
quered Satan, has promised, "Lo, I am with you alway,
even unto the end of the world." He has given his
precious truth to meet all the wiles of the adversary (2
Thess. 2 : to-12); he has promised that when the enemy
shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord shall
lift up a standard against him (Isa. 59 : 19); God will keep
his people in the hour of temptation which is coming on
all the world to try those who dwell on the earth (Rev. 3 :
to).

        themselves?

                       NOTES.
  1. A Partaker of the Glory That Shall Be Revealed.
— God's glory is in his character (see Ex. 33:18, ; 34
30           TIE FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER.

5-7). That character, that glory, will be seen in all its
transcendent loveliness when the King appears in his
beauty (Isa. 33:17); but men may know him here (John
17:3), by faith they may now appropriate his righteous-
ness (Rom. 3 :21, 22), and have the beauty of the Lord
upon them (Ps.9o:t7). And so Peter in this life par-
took of the glory which shall be revealed, not only in
Christ but in us (Rom. 8: 18)
   2. Neither As Being Lords over God's Heritage.—
 There is a strange and striking contrast between that
church which claims to find her primal head in Peter,
and in which is the highest development of the mystery
of iniquity, and the instruction given by the Lord through
Peter to the true church of Christ. In the apostate
church we have lords many, who do little else but lord
it over the souls of God's heritage, and when they held
the power, they lorded over their bodies; and all of the
persecutions of the Dark Ages have come because men
professing to be ministers of Christ have lorded it over
God's heritage in their lust of power and filthy lucre.
The apostle presents the duty of the true elder ; let him
heed the instructions, and rjot content himself with be-
ing better than others. Feed the flock of God with the
Word (I Peter 2: 2), which is able to build them up (Acts
zo :32); doing willingly even as the Master, having com-
passion (Mark 6:34), not for gain of lucre but gain of
souls, ensamples to the flock in all soberness, humility,
and fa.thfulness. (Seer Tim. 3: 1-7; Titus I : 5-9.)
  3. Submit-Be Subject. —Of course under God. God
is first. His requirements are paramount. But the
faithful man of God upon whom in the providence of
God is placed burdens in the church, God will sustain,
and through him will give instruction to the flock, which
may not be disregarded or despised except at peril to
the soul. As the elder must watch for souls as they that
              THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER.                31

must give an account (Heb. 13: 17), so it is a correspond-
ing duty of the church to heed the faithful admonitions,
warnings, and instruction which God gives through the
elders. See Heb. 13 : 7, 8, 17 ; I 'Mess. 5 : 12, 13. The
dignity and position of the elder is to he respected for
Christ's sake (I Tim. 5 : i), and no accusation is to be re-
ceived against him except at the mouth of two or three
witnesses (verse 19). Subject one to another.—See
Phil. 2 : 3 ; Rom. 12 : Io ; Eph. 5 : 21;Humility.—A most
precious grace, because teachable. See Matt. 5 : 3; Isa.
57     ; 66 : 2; James 4: 10.

11. The Mighty Helper. Verses 10-14.
     i. Who haS called us?
     2. To what has he called us?
     3. Through whom does this call come?
     4. Through what experience do we all have to
          pass?
     5. What will he do for us through it all?
     6. To whom then will belong the glory?
     7. What does the apostle declare he has tes-
          tified?
     8. What is the final benediction to all?

                        NOTES.
   1. Whom Resist.—The only way to resist the enemy
is by faith in Christ. We cannot do it by watching Satan
as we would by watching a physical foe. If our eyes
are fixed upon the enemy, we fall before him; and it is
his greatest object to induce us to look at him. When
Peter looked down upon the raging waves, he sank; when
his eyes were on Christ, he safely walked the boiling bil-
lows. "Looking unto Jesus" is our only safety (Heb.
12 ; 2, 3) ; for faith puts him before us so that we do not
have to meet the enemy ; Christ meets him. Satan's
accusations fall against Christ's righteousness, his craft
against Christ's wisdom, his power against the mighty
power of Christ, and by faith we are more than con-
queror. We are not alone in trials ; the children of
God have them to meet everywhere, but Christ is able
to succor all who trust him. Heb. 2 : r8.
  2. Called.—Let the heart rest on the great fact that
God has called us, not to wrath (i Thess. 5 :9), but to
eternal glory (r Peter 5 : io); Christ died that all might
              THE FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER.                33

have it (John 3: i6; 20: 31); he accepted us according to
the good pleasure of his will (Eph. i :5, 6); he has
wrought us for immortality (2 Cor. 5 4, 5); and he who
has begun the good work is able to finish it till the day of
Jesus Christ (Phil. z:6). Why should we doubt God?
God himself has undertaken the work which it is his will,
his good pleasure, to finish. Shall we not make his will
ours? The sufferings and trials we meet will not hinder
him. Satan will say that we are killed all the day long
like.sheep for the slaughter, but faith says, because Christ
says, that in all these things we are more than conquer-
ors through Him that loved us. Rom 8: 36-39.

                         NOTE. •
   INTEMPERANCE IS by no means to be confined to in-
dulgence in alcoholic or fermented liquors. Whatever it
is to which a man stoops in blind submission, upon which
he wastes his powers of mind or body uselessly, is .a
master, and he is a slave, and the repeated act of indul-
gence is intemperance, fraught with the same direful
consequences, bondage of soul and body, and at last ir-
retrievable ruin. Thus tobacco in its various forms
holds millions in its power. Tea and coffee hold mil-
lions more in bondage. Of course the last two are not as'
bad as the use of alcohol, opium, absinthe, and tobacco,
but, though milder, they do no good, they enslave the
mind, blunt the finer sensibilities of the soul, and so un-
fit it to appreciate the glorious truths bf God. Freedom
in Christ is freedom from every enthralling habit.
