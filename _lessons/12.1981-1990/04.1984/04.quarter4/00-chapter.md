                             Introduction

            Jesus Our Mediator
    The desperateness of our situation called for a mediator. Our planet
was isolated in rebellion. Its inhabitants had been infected with sin. The
survival of the human race was in doubt. Communication had been
limited, and a great gulf separated human beings from God. An impen-
etrable gloom enshrouded the globe. To all appearances the rebels were
without hope, without remedy.
    To bridge the gulf a mediator was needed who could provide a way
back to God—someone in between, someone who could bring the es-
tranged parties together. In the desperate situation God took the initia-
tive. Christ was provided as Mediator. He alone had the proper creden-
tials and credibility to be able to guarantee results, to speak to both sides
and to draw fallen human beings back into fellowship with God. In order
to do so He had to be willing to pay the price, no matter how high it would
be. Being interested in us in a most personal way, He was determined not
to fail or become discouraged in His intervention on our behalf.
    The Mediator has acted and continues to act in our behalf. Most of His
primary mission has been accomplished. Planet Earth rightfully is His.
The broken relationship has been restored. The communication gulf has
been bridged, the gloom has been lifted, and salvation has been provided
for those willing to accept it.
    Two more acts in the drama remain—the completion of the investiga-
 tive judgment and the complete banishment of the instigator, the archen-
 emy, the chief rebel and his followers in the fmal executive judgment.
 Annihilation of the root cause will lead to the restoration of the planet to
what God originally intended it to be.
    For the next thirteen weeks, we will embark on a study journey
 through this grand truth, Jesus our Mediator, and will trace His activity
 and ministry. We will come to know Him better in the many phases of His
 noble efforts to rescue humanity. We will understand more clearly the
 way God works and come to experience at deeper levels the impact of
 what He has done and what He is doing—of the great salvation He has
 provided. Doing so should enable us to articulate more effectively the
 essential meaning of the grand old story. No wonder this teaching has
 been called the central doctrine of the Christian faith. It is a key to the
 unity of the Bible. In the Mediator, Jesus Christ, God has placed before
 His throne our Substitute and Surety.
    Christianity is a religion of mediation. Ever since the inception of sin,
 Jesus has been and continues to be our Mediator with the Father. His
  mediation is our only hope of redemption and restoration.
    "God is approached through Jesus Christ, the Mediator, the only way
  through which He forgives sins. . . . This is the sinner's only hope, and if
  he rests here in sincere faith, he is sure of pardon and that full and free.
  There is only one channel and that is accessible to all, and through that
  channel a rich and abundant forgiveness awaits the penitent, contrite soul
  and the darkest sins are forgiven."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A.
 Bible Commentary, vol. 7, pp. 912, 913.

The Great Gulf
MEMORY TEXT: "Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened, that it can-
not save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: but your iniquities have
separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from
you, that he will not hear" (Isa. 59:1, 2).

   Modern literature is studded with terms such as hostility, estrange-
ment, and alienation. If writers and artists reflect the thinking and feel-
ings of their generation, then our generation is characterized in a special
way by a sense of separation and lostness. The biblical writers, the
prophets, always have addressed such a feeling. They had what might be
called three-dimensional vision—being able to see the past, present, and
future. From their viewpoint, God and human beings are separated by a
great gulf across which God alone is able to provide a bridge. These holy
men of God did not speak softly. Loudly and clearly they thundered and
trumpeted about the awful distance, the terrible chasm that lay between
sinful humanity and the sinless God. The prophets may appear to be
gloomy, even pessimistic at times; but, above all, they are realists. They
tell it like it is. It is against this dark background that the good news is
flashed and is all the more welcome because of it. The chasm has been
bridged by the Mediator.
   "By transgression man was severed from God, the communion be-
tween them was broken; but Jesus Christ died upon the cross of Calvary,
bearing in His body the sins of the whole world, and the gulf between
heaven and earth was bridged by that cross. Christ leads men to the gulf,
and points to the bridge by which it is spanned, saying, 'If any man will
come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and
follow me.' "—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary,
vol. 7, p. 941.
   In John 3:14 we find Jesus telling Nicodemus that He, the Son of man,
must be "lifted up" on the cross. To lift up is to place in full view. Christ
on the cross becomes the great center of attraction, the magnet that
draws. Thus God and human beings are drawn together. The hostility,
the rebellion, the sinfulness, all that separates, is overcome by this "lift-
ing up." The cross now serves as the mightiest of weapons and is indis-
pensable to the work of mediation.

Part 1 — God Is Holy
      "Above it [the throne] stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with
    twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with
    twain he did fly. And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is
    the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory" (Isa. 6:2, 3). (See also
    Rev. 4:8.)

      Heaven is a worshiping community. God is the object of worship. He
    dwells in light unapproachable. All of heaven's inhabitants recognize His
    benevolent sovereignty. There is an essential difference between God
    and His created beings. In the sense of ultimate sacredness He alone is
    holy. When we speak of the holiness of God, we mean His absolute per-
    fection of character in contrast with human imperfections, His infinite
    purity in contrast to human impurities. God is the "wholly other" and as
    such is unapproachable by fallen beings. The gulf between God and sinful
    humanity is a real one. The separation is clear and distinct. Modern think-
    ing would narrow the gap by reducing God to the likeness of humanity.
    When this is done the awe and mystery that the Bible attributes to angelic
    worship gives way to a familiarity on our part that is out of place. God's
    holiness must be kept in proper perspective.

         What is significant about Isaiah's response to the vision of God? Isa. 6:5.


       Isaiah's response is the only proper response. "You should solemnly
    consider that you are dealing with the great God, and should ever remem-
    ber that He is not a child, to be trifled with."—Testimonies, vol. 2,
    p. 221. Whenever human beings glimpse the awesome purity and holiness
    of God, their response is similar to Isaiah's. One example is that of Peter
    when he recognized this quality of holiness in Jesus Christ. His reaction
    was, "Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, 0 Lord" (Luke 5:8). Later
    Peter came to realize that the sinner needs to draw close to God in order
    to overcome sin.

    SEARCH AND LEARN: Indicate below what some of the other Bible writ-
    ers have to say about God's holiness:

Part 2 — My Thoughts Are Not Your Thoughts
      "My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,
    saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways
    higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts" (Isa. 55:8, 9).

      God should never be confused with His creatures. He is different. In
    this lesson we will not deal with minor contrasts but with vast differ-
    ences. God and those created in His image have different modes and pat-
    terns of thought—different perceptions. As the prophet sees it, there is
    no point where human lines of thinking can serve as the measure of God's
    way of thinking.
       However, we are not talking about a God whose apparent remoteness
    and total "otherness" means that He is inaccessible to us. The Bible pic-
    tures God as being greatly concerned about people. His high and lofty
    thoughts are not evil, malicious thoughts. They are loving "thoughts of
    peace" (Jer. 29:11). (See also Ps. 40:5; Ps. 139:17, 18.)

    SEARCH AND LEARN: Today's text speaks of the thoughts of God and the
    ways of God. Read the texts that follow; then indicate how they describe the
    ways of God:

       Seventh-day Adventists are called upon to reproduce God's character
    before the world in word and life. How can we do so convincingly if we
    have not caught Isaiah's vision? Ellen White gives this description of the
    kind of people who can represent the true God rightly: "Like Moses, they
    have had a view of the awful majesty of holiness, and they see their own
    unworthiness in contrast with the purity and exalted perfection of the In-
    finite One."—The Great Controversy, p. 470.

    THINK IT THROUGH: What does all this say to us about worship? How
    can we apply in our homes and in our churches what we have been study-
    ing? How will it affect our witness?

Part 3 — We Are Sinners
     "Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive
    me" (Ps. 51:5).

       The Bible states it clearly. There is no possibility of misunderstanding
    it. We are sinners. Although we are not born with the guilt of sin, we are
    born with natures inclined to sin. This is our natural condition. We are
    not condemned for what we inherited from Adam, but the result of that
    inheritance is evident in those sins for which we are held accountable.

      What is the significance of the term Paul uses to illustrate our sinful na-
    ture? Rom. 7:18; 8:5, 8, 12, 14.


       Paul often uses the term flesh to describe the unregenerate state in
    which we find ourselves. When used this way, carnal mind and flesh are
    synonyms. The carnal or fleshly mind is the seat of sin. Sin permeates the
    flesh and uses it for evil purposes. The flesh has a bent or bias toward
    sinning, an evil orientation. "There is in his [man's] nature a bent to evil,
    a force which, unaided, he cannot resist"—Education, p. 29.
       Paul uses another term—Adam or the first Adam. By this he means
    that unregenerate, unsanctified humanity is tied to Adam's fate. This is
    the sin-death syndrome. "As in Adam all die" (1 Cor. 15:22).
       In the "flesh" we human beings are dominated by another power. We
    are in bondage to self; in slavery, "sold under sin" (Rom. 7:14). Because
    the human heart resents this fact, it attempts in various ways to deny it.
    Bondage is a harsh word. No one likes the idea of such a galling yoke. In
    Jesus' day the religious leaders reacted violently to His suggestion that
    they were slaves. But the principle is clear. "Whosoever committeth sin
    is the servant of sin." The worst possible bondage is to be ruled by evil.
       "Every soul that refuses to give himself to God is under the control of
    another power. He is not his own man. He may talk of freedom, but he is
    in the most abject slavery. He is not allowed to see the beauty of truth, for
    his mind is under the control of Satan. While he flatters himself that he is
    following the dictates of his own judgment, he obeys the will of the prince
    of darkness."—The Desire of Ages, p. 466.
       From every perspective the gulf between God and humans is impass-
    able. The situation in which we find ourselves demands a mediator.

       How far was Heaven willing to go to provide the needed Mediator? Rom.
     8:3.

Part 4 — Rebels
     "The carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of
    God, neither indeed can be" (Rom. 8:7).

      Sin has thrown us out of harmony with heaven. Our moral machinery
    does not mesh with the operation of the heavenly machinery. As sinners
    we are rebels, at enmity with God rather than with Satan. Like a man
    caught in quicksand, all our efforts to extricate ourselves only plunge us
    deeper in the quagmire. "It is impossible for us, of ourselves, to escape
    from the pit of sin in which we are sunken. Our hearts are evil, and we
    cannot change them."—Steps to Christ, p. 18.

         What is the function of the law? Rom. 3:20; 7:7.


       Self-deception is a terrible thing. Yet, all of us are subject to it. We are
    tempted to live out a charade that Jesus called "hypocrisy" (play acting).
    Often we go to great lengths to avoid being uncovered and even may
    achieve a measure of success in our game, thus becoming comfortable
    and self-satisfied. Then God's law pierces our souls. We perceive it as a
    living, active, dynamic power—a revelation of God's character—rather
    than as commandments written on stone. For the first time we recognize
    the spirituality of the law as opposed to the letter. It dawns on us what our
    real condition is—we are in the wrong camp, under the wrong banner,
    possessed by the wrong spirit. We are horrified to realize that we really
    never knew ourselves before. "The heart is deceitful above all things,
    and desperately wicked; who can know it?" (Jer. 17:9).
       "The apostle Paul, in relating his experience, presents an important
    truth concerning the work to be wrought in conversion. He says, 'I was
    alive without the law once'—he felt no condemnation; 'but when the
    commandment came,' when the law of God was urged upon his con-
    science, 'sin revived, and I died.' Then he saw himself a sinner, con-
    demned by the divine law."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible
    Commentary, vol. 6, p. 1076.

      What significance do you see in the additional terms that are used to de-
    scribe the human condition outside of Christ? Eph. 2:2, 3; Col. 1:21; 3:6.


      The distance or gulf between ourselves and God is intensified by our
    repeated sinning, our refusal to make God supreme in our lives. Our
    fallen nature is far from being like God's nature. By nature He is good,
    just, and holy. All His attributes may be summarized in a single word—
    love. By nature we are the opposite. The work of the Mediator is to bring
    these two opposites together—the sinful person and the holy God. This
    calls for a radical change that can be brought about only by Christ.

Part 5 — Morality Alone Cannot Bridge the Gulf
      There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:
    the same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that
    thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that
    thou doest, except God be with him. Jesus answered and said unto him,
    Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see
    the kingdom of God" (John 3:1-3).

        Nicodemus "was a strict Pharisee, and prided himself on his good
     works. He was widely esteemed for his benevolence and his liberality in
     sustaining the temple service, and he felt secure in the favor of God. . . .
           . . By virtue of his birth as an Israelite he regarded himself as sure of
     a place in the kingdom of God. He felt that he needed no change. Hence
     his surprise at the Saviour's words. He was irritated by their close appli-
     cation to himself. The pride of the Pharisee was struggling against the
     honest desire of the seeker after truth."—The Desire of Ages, p. 171.
        In Nicodemus' case religion was an obstacle to faith. His brand of reli-
     gion gave him a false security. He wanted to make his morality and good
     works the basis of acceptance with God. Jesus punctured his preconcep-
     tions. It is not rank sinners alone but all persons—high, low, rich, poor,
     religious, and irreligious—who need Christ to make them and their works
     acceptable to God.

       What balance do we find in the writings of Paul about the futility of even
     the moral individual's efforts to work out his own salvation and about the
     necessity of good works? Rom. 3:20; Phil. 2:12, 13.


        Without Christ even the moral person's efforts fall short. The gulf that
     separates God from sinful beings is too deep and wide to be bridged by
     human works. "Education, culture, the exercise of the will, human ef-
     fort, all have their proper sphere, but here they are powerless. They may
     produce an outward correctness of behavior, but they cannot change the
     heart; they cannot purify the springs of life. There must be a power work-
     ing from within, a new life from above, before men can be changed from
     sin to holiness. . . .
        " . . The idea that it is necessary only to develop the good that exists
     in man by nature, is a fatal deception."—Steps to Christ, pp. 18, 19.
        "He who is trying to reach heaven by his own works in keeping the law
     is attempting an impossibility. There is no safety for the one who has
     merely a legal religion, a form of godliness."—The Desire of Ages, p.
     172.
        The biblical writers leave us one conclusion alone. Human beings must
     look to some power above and outside of themselves—to God, for salva-
     tion and for power to live as God wants us to live.

                                                                                  11

Part 6 — Focus and Application
      "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of
    man be lifted up: that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but
    have eternal life" (John 3:14, 15).

       Incredible as it may seem, the terrible chasm that separates God and
    humans has been bridged by Christ, symbolized as a serpent on a pole.
    "When the people of Israel were dying from the sting of the fiery ser-
    pents, God directed Moses to make a serpent of brass, and place it on
    high in the midst of the congregation. Then the word was sounded
    throughout the encampment that all who would look upon the serpent
    should live. The people well knew that in itself the serpent had no power
    to help them. It was a symbol of Christ."—The Desire of Ages, p. 174.

       In what way do 2 Corinthians 5:21 and Galatians 3:13 help us to under-
    stand why Christ was represented by the symbol of evil, the serpent?


      The serpent has been the symbol of sin ever since Satan chose to use
    that symbol in the Garden of Eden. The serpent on the pole represents
    Christ becoming sin for us.
      The first gospel sermon was preached by God Himself in the Garden of
    Eden. Our Lord did not let things drift before implementing the great plan
    of redemption. He declared to the serpent, "I will put enmity between
    thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise
    thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel" (Gen. 3:15). The seed of the
    woman is the God-man who would accept the death penalty, a painful
    wound from which He would recover. Before God pronounced the sen-
    tence of death on the guilty pair, He gave a message of hope—a Saviour
    will come, and He will be your Substitute and Surety.

      How are people's responses to the good news of a Saviour from sin illus-
    trated in the experience of Cain and Abel? Gen. 4:3-5.


      Cain's refusal to comply with God's instructions was a denial of God's
    authority. However, "Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice
    than Cain" (Heb. 11:4).

    APPLICATION: The first lesson sets the stage for the study of "Jesus
    Our Mediator" by showing how sin has placed a universal gulf between
    God and humanity. Identify the specific issues that mark this general gulf
    and be prepared to discuss in class how we as Christians should relate to
    these issues in our everyday lives.

REAPING Adult Lesson



The Go-between
MEMORY TEXT: "There is one God, and one mediator between God and
men, the man Christ Jesus" (1 Tim. 2:5).

   From the inception of sin Jesus the Son has been the Go-between, the
Mediator. The only member of the Godhead who has been made visible,
He is the supreme revealer of God. Every contact with planet Earth since
the entrance of sin has been through Jesus Christ. "The Father has given
the world into the hands of Christ, that through His mediatorial work He
may redeem man and vindicate the authority and holiness of the law of
God. All the communion between heaven and the fallen race has been
through Christ."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 366.
   Jesus, the Mediator, stands "in the midst of the throne" (Rev. 5:6),
firmly rooted in the Deity. He also became a citizen of earth in our behalf,
thus connecting earth and heaven. "No man hath ascended up to heaven,
but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in
heaven" (John 3:13). He still is the God in between. His mediatorial min-
istry is designed to bring together the parties separated by sin, including
those that were under the curse. "Having made peace through the blood
of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say,
whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven" (Col. 1:20).
   Before the foundation of the world the members of the Godhead agreed
that Jesus would become Heaven's agent of mercy and redemption—the
God who would bridge the gulf that was discussed in our last lesson. Ever
since that agreement was made, He has never slackened His efforts or
changed His position. He has remained constant, in Old Testament
 times, in New Testament times, and through the long centuries on this
side of His ascension. "Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and
 for ever" (Heb. 13:8). And so, He will ever be, world without end, the
 One who agreed to stand between us and the Father, earth and heaven,
 the unique and incomparable Mediator, the channel of saving grace, the
 One who procures eternal salvation for those who look to Him in faith,
 constantly trusting and obeying Him.

Part 1 — God From Eternity
     "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the com-
    munion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen" (2 Cor. 13:14).

       In order to understand as best we can Christ's position as Mediator, it
    is necessary to recognize that He was and is a member of the triune God-
    head, existing through all eternity. When we study the doctrine of the
    Trinity we indeed are on holy ground. The idea of one God existing as
    three persons is difficult for many to accept. There are three persons in
    the Trinity, but we must be aware that the term person when used of
    divinity is not the precise equivalent of the same term when it is used to
    apply to human beings.
       The unity of God is the great truth that distinguished Israel from her
    neighbors. "Hear, 0 Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord" (Deut. 6:4).
    Does the truth revealed in the Old Testament then contradict the truth
    revealed in the New Testament? Of course not. The word used for God in
    the first chapter of the Bible suggests more than one person within the
    one Godhead. "God said, Let us make man in our image" (Gen. 1:26).
    This doctrine of the Trinity is spiritually enriching to us. God has not
    existed from all eternity as a single solitary being, but there always has
    been unity and communion within the Godhead.

     What did Jesus indicate about there being three persons in the Godhead?
    Matt. 28:19, 20.


      Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit are distinct personalities; yet They
    form a divine unity and act unitedly in creation and redemption. "There
    are three living persons of the heavenly trio; in the name of these three
    great powers—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit—those who re-
    ceive Christ by living faith are baptized, and these powers will co-operate
    with the obedient subjects of heaven in their efforts to live the new life in
    Christ."—Evangelism, p. 615.

Part 2 — Foreordained Before the World Was
     "Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but
    was manifest in these last times for you" (1 Peter 1:20).
     "In hope of eternal life which God, that cannot lie, promised before the
    world began" (Titus 1:2).

      It was settled in the eternal councils of the Godhead that Jesus, the
    Son, should be man's Redeemer. We do not know exactly when. The
    Bible simply says, "before the foundation of the world." "The plan of
    salvation had been laid before the creation of the earth."—Patriarchs
    and Prophets, p. 63. The plan was laid, well thought out, and carefully
    designed. Nothing was left to chance. The agreement was that Jesus
    should be the Lamb, the Sin Bearer.

      What term used by Zechariah sometimes is used to describe the confer-
    ence where the decision was made to redeem man? Zech. 6:13. (See also
    Acts 2:23.)


       "None but Christ could redeem fallen man from the curse of the law
     and bring him again into harmony with Heaven. Christ would take upon
     Himself the guilt and shame of sin—sin so offensive to a holy God that it
     must separate the Father and His Son. Christ would reach to the depths
     of misery to rescue the ruined race.
       "Before the Father He pleaded in the sinner's behalf, while the host of
     heaven awaited the result with an intensity of interest that words cannot
     express. Long continued was that mysterious communing—`the counsel
     of peace' . . . for the fallen sons of men. The plan of salvation had been
     laid before the creation of the earth . . . ; yet it was a struggle, even with
     the King of the universe, to yield up His Son to die for the guilty race. But
     `God so loved the world, that He gave his only-begotten Son, that whoso-
     ever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.' John
     3:16."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 63.
        "As a priest, Christ is now set down with the Father in His throne.
     Revelation 3:21. Upon the throne with the eternal, self-existent One is He
     who hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.' . . .
        " 'And the counsel of peace shall be between Them both.' The love of
     the Father, no less than of the Son, is the fountain of salvation for the lost
     race. . . . And in the ministration in the sanctuary above, 'the counsel of
     peace shall be between Them both.' "—The Great Controversy, pp. 416,
     417.
        Sin sent shock waves throughout the universe. Heaven itself was
     greatly affected. Angels stopped singing. Gloom spread everywhere.
     Was earth to be forever cut off? Was the situation hopeless? No! As soon
     as sin occurred Jesus stepped into the breach. He acknowledged His role
     and function as Mediator, Surety, and Substitute for the human race.

Part 3 — Communicator and Revealer
       "I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and
    in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven
    horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all
    the earth" (Rev. 5:6).

       At the center or focal point of John's vision stands Jesus. He has all
    power (seven horns), He is all knowing (seven eyes), and through the
    Spirit He is present everywhere.
       To Jesus, the Second Person of the Godhead, has been assigned the
    task of being the One within the Godhead who is to reveal God to lost
    beings. Jesus is the Great Communicator. The fact that He is called
    "Son" does not mean that He did not exist eternally. "The term by
    which He is known, the Son of God, reflects His place in the plan of
    salvation, a role determined before the world was created."—Adventist
    Review, "The Son," Special Issue on Bible Doctrines [July 30, 1981], p.
    6. After sin came, God continued to keep in contact with humanity
    through Christ.

         What do we learn about Jesus as God's chief spokesman? Heb. 11:1, 2.


      This text implies that Christ serves as God's perfect Communicator
    and Revealer. He is God's thought made audible, His speech made
    understandable, and His form made visible. A. J. Gordon, an American
    pastor of an earlier generation, took the position that Jesus is God spell-
    ing Himself out to humans in language that we can understand. He felt
    that all we need to know and can possibly know about God is revealed to
    us in Jesus Christ.

    SEARCH AND LEARN: When we speak of Jesus as the Second Person of
    the Godhead, how do we avoid implying that He is inferior to God the Fa-
    ther? Indicate how the following passages contribute to our answer to this
    question:

    John 1:1, 2

    Heb. 1:8, 9

    Col. 2:9
      Jesus stands fully in the counsels of God, sharing His most intimate
    secrets. This kind of relationship is possible only among equals. Jesus
    does not assume a prerogative that is not His when He says, "I come
    from the bosom of the Father. We are one."

                                                        The Go-between

Part 4 — Between God and Us
      "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man
    cometh unto the Father, but by me" (John 14:6).

      In His own person Jesus is the way between God and humans. He does
    not say that He will construct or make a way; rather, He declares, "I am
    the way." How does He accomplish this? By His incarnation. By taking
    on human flesh. "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and
    we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full
    of grace and truth" (John 1:14).
      "The humanity of the Son of God is everything to us. It is the golden
    chain that binds our souls to Christ, and through Christ to God."—Ellen
    G. White, Youth's Instructor, October 13, 1898.
      Divinity and humanity were mysteriously combined, and man and God
    became one. It is in this union that we find the hope of our fallen race.
    Looking upon Christ in humanity, we look upon God."—Ellen G. White,
    Signs of the Times, July 30, 1896.

      How did Jesus illustrate the comunication system between earth and
    heaven? What makes communication between heaven and earth possible?
    John 1:51; 14:6.


      In His own person and being, Jesus is the connecting link between
    heaven and earth; He is the communication system, the ladder, on which
    angels ascend and descend. Angels are messengers. They carry the com-
    muniques, but Jesus is the passageway over which the angels travel.
    Without this provision no communication would be possible.
      "Up to the time of man's rebellion against the government of God,
    there had been free communion between God and man. But the sin of
    Adam and Eve separated earth from heaven, so that man could not have
    communion with his Maker. Yet the world was not left in solitary hope-
    lessness. The ladder represents Jesus, the appointed medium of commu-
    nication. Had He not . . . bridged the gulf that sin had made, the minis-
    tering angels could have held no communion with fallen man. Christ
    connects man in his weakness and helplessness with the source of infinite
     power."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 184.

       How do we avoid giving the impression that we think of Jesus as shielding
     us from an angry Father? What part did the Father have in providing the
     "way"? John 3:16, 17; 2 Cor. 5:19.


       God is the provider, the One who gives. His love prompts Him to give.

Part 5 — Between Human Beings
       "That he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having
    slain the enmity thereby" (Eph. 2:16).

      Christ's mediation not only affects the relationships between Jews and
    Gentiles but all relationships. He joins humanity with divinity. At the
    same time He does not leave the human race without the means to live at
    peace on personal, family, or national levels. Jesus is the cement that
    binds. His blood is the bonding agent. His mediatorial work forms more
    than a dry theory. It has a powerful effect on all who accept Him as their
    personal Saviour. All that He has done is of no avail until we take advan-
    tage of it. The work of Calvary should be ongoing and continual.

      What practical result of Christ's mediation takes place in human experi-
    ence? Col. 3:15-17.


       "A union of believers with Christ will as a natural result lead to a union
    with one another, which bond of union is the most enduring upon earth.
    We are one in Christ, as Christ is one with the Father."—Testimonies,
    vol. 5, p. 47.
      "The heart of him who receives the grace of God overflows with love
    for God and for those for whom Christ died. Self is not struggling for
    recognition. . . . He is kind and thoughtful, humble in his opinion of him-
    self, yet full of hope, always trusting in the mercy and love of God. . . .
       "The grace of Christ is to control the temper and the voice. Its working
    will be seen in politeness and tender regard shown by brother for brother,
    in kind, encouraging words. . . . Love is manifested in kindness, gentle-
    ness, forbearance, and long-suffering."—Christ's Object Lessons, pp.
    101, 102.
      As one Bible scholar describes it, the Christian church is a cross-
    shaped community, formed and shaped by the power of the cross. The
    church community continues to experience the reconciliation which the
    cross brings. Its members are crucified with Christ. He mediates to them
    His peace. In turn they are to reflect in their characters and conduct what
    Christ's sacrificial and high-priestly ministry make possible.

     How important to Jesus is the matter of reconciliation between church
    members? Matt. 5:23, 24.


       Whatever might be the cause, Jesus regards estrangement between be-
    lievers as a serious matter. It should be observed that the worshiper was
    under obligation to seek out the brother who "had ought against" him.
    He must take the initiative, not imputing guilt to the one whom it could be
    reasoned was the offender.

Part 6 — Focus and Application
      "Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offer-
    ing thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me: in burnt offerings
    and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure. Then said I, Lo, I come (in
    the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, 0 God" (Heb.
    10:5-7).

       Jesus cheerfully, voluntarily accepted the awesome assignment to do
    whatever was necessary to bring God and humanity together. He knew
    that it would involve suffering, deprivation, and death. When He ex-
    plained to the angels what was involved, they recoiled in horror. They
    were loathe to let their Commander go. But He was determined. The de-
    cision, the contract had been made during the mysterious "council of
    peace." The Father also was torn. There was trauma in the heart of God;
    and it was a struggle, even for God, to yield up His Son to die for us. This
    is the mystery of redemption. The Father was willing to endure the pain
    because of His love for us.

       How committed was Jesus to His unique mission? Isa. 42:4; 53:11.


        Our Lord was determined to give Himself completely to His mission.
     No sacrifice was deemed too great. When He came to earth the immedi-
     ate prospects often were disappointing, but He persevered. He refused to
     give in to circumstances—never becoming discouraged, never failing.
     His concentration was intense. Zeal for God and the salvation of the lost
     consumed Him. He forgot to eat. He was oblivious to danger. He looked
     straight ahead and "for the joy that was set before him endured the cross,
     despising the shame" (Heb. 12:2).

     APPLICATION: From the parable of the lost sheep, what can we learn
     about Jesus, His mission, and our salvation? Luke 15:4-7.


       Leaving the 99 sheep that were safe in the fold, the shepherd ventured
     out to seek the one that was lost. He searched for it until He found it.
     Here again we find a picture of intense interest, concentration, and deter-
     mination. Jesus is interested in the last, the lost, and the least. The three
     parables of Luke 15 illustrate this perfectly. The sheep was lost in the
     wilderness, foolishly wandering. The coin was lost in the house. It did not
     realize that it was lost. The prodigal son was lost because of his willful
     disobedience. He knew that he was lost. The sheep and the coin could do
     nothing to save themselves. Someone must expend the effort to do for
     them what they could not do for themselves. Jesus took this as His spe-
     cial assignment. It also is ours. We have a part to play in our salvation.
     We have choices to make. How will you respond?

                                                                               19

 Universa0 Need
MEMORY TEXT: "We know that the whole creation groaneth and travail-
eth in pain together until now. And not only they, but ourselves also, which
have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves,
waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body" (Rom. 8:22,
23).

  The entire universe was affected by transgression. We are reminded of
this in many ways. Nature provides its testimony in such disasters as
earthquakes, floods, tornadoes, and storms. Human experience reflects
the terrible reality—divorce, wars, and crime. Since the day when the sin
of our first parents sent a chill of terror through the universe, things have
been out of harmony and sin has cast its dark shadow of decay and death
over creation. The startling fact is that the unfallen worlds at one time
were threatened and still are involved. The work of Christ in the heavenly
sanctuary cannot be understood fully merely in relation to what He is
doing for the inhabitants of planet Earth.
  "The plan of redemption had a yet broader and deeper purpose than
the salvation of man. It was not for this alone that Christ came to the
earth; it was not merely that the inhabitants of this little world might re-
gard the law of God as it should be regarded; but it was to vindicate the
character of God before the universe."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 68.
  The Creator and Sustainer must stand between His creation and the
shadow of death, protecting human beings, the inhabitants of unfallen
worlds, and even angels from the consequences of the rebellion.
  "It is through the efficacy of the cross that the angels of heaven are
guarded from apostasy. Without the cross they would be no more secure
against evil than were the angels before the fall of Satan."—Ellen G.
White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1132.
  Ultimately, through Jesus' mediation, there will be perfect harmony
throughout the universe. The scars and mars will be removed. That
which was lost to sin will be brought back. The plan of salvation pre-
serves, keeps, restores, and "provides an eternal safeguard against de-
fection in unfallen worlds, as well as among those who shall be redeemed
by the blood of the Lamb."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible
Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1132.
  Through Jesus the universal need is fulfilled.

Part 1— Creator and Sustainer
      "Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things,
    that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the
    greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one faileth" (Isa.
    40:26).

       God is not an absentee landlord. Not only did He create but He sus-
    tains. He superintends the vast creation. Nothing, from the smallest atom
    to the greatest star, escapes His watchcare. He is the God of the infini-
    tesimally small and the infinitely great. He is an exquisite craftsman. The
    delicate balance of nature demands His constant involvement. The uni-
    verse is not a huge clock that was wound up tight in the beginning and has
    since then run under its own energies. The laws of nature cannot and do
    not operate apart from nature's God. The Bible pictures a God who is
    intimately acquainted with His creation. Isaiah's words are impressive—
    the vast number of stars, constellations, and planets have been numbered
    and named by their Creator. The fact that the universe holds together and
    is a dependable system is attributed properly by the prophets to the
    power and wisdom of God.

    SEARCH AND LEARN: What do the texts that follow contribute to our
    understanding that Christ was the active agent in Creation?

       John 1:1-3

       Eph 3.9

       Col. 1:16, 17

       Heb. 1:1, 2
       "It was Christ that spread the heavens, and laid the foundations of the
    earth. It was His hand that hung the worlds in space, and fashioned the
    flowers of the field."—The Desire of Ages, p. 20.

       For what purpose did God create the earth? Isa. 45:12, 18.


       The unselfishness of God is reflected in creation. He intended to peo-
     ple many planets with holy, happy beings who would reflect His life to
     each other and thus return to Him a revenue of glory. His pleasure is not
     primarily in inanimate objects, but in persons. In his vision of the heav-
     enly throne room John hears the worshipers exclaiming, "Thou hast cre-
     ated all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created" (Rev.
     4:11). The Creator is the Sustainer. He also accepts the responsibility for
     redeeming the lost planet and its inhabitants. He does not abandon His
     creation.

                                                                                21

Part 2 — Under Bondage
         "The earth will wear out like a garment" (Isa. 51:6, NIV).

       Sin has an ecological effect. The earth is under the curse. This explains
    why there are weeds, noxious plants, brambles, briars, thorns, and a
    planet breaking down with age; wearing "out like a garment" (Ps. 102:26,
    RSV). Suffering and death are the norm. Adam and Eve grieved at the
    first falling leaf. The climate became subject to marked changes. Later
    natural disasters began to wreak destruction. Death and corruption made
    inroads into every family. Since the inception of sin, earth and its inhabit-
    ants have been sliding downhill.

         How is the human disharmony with nature demonstrated? Gen. 3:17-19.


       The bondage of corruption (Rom. 8:21) has the planet in its viselike
    grip. "Under the curse of sin all nature was to witness to man of the char-
    acter and results of rebellion against God. When God made man, He
    made him ruler over the earth and all living creatures. So long as Adam
    remained loyal to Heaven, all nature was in subjection to him. But when
    he rebelled against the divine law, the inferior creatures were in rebellion
    against his rule. Thus the Lord, in His great mercy, would show men the
    sacredness of His law and lead them, by their own experience, to see the
    danger of setting it aside, even in the slightest degree.
       "And the life of toil and care which was henceforth to be man's lot was
    appointed in love. It was a discipline rendered needful by his sin, to place
    a check upon the indulgence of appetite and passion, to develop habits of
    self-control. It was a part of God's great plan for man's recovery from the
    ruin and degradation of sin."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 59, 60.
       In spite of earth's decay, God's salvation and righteousness are un-
    changed. The salvation and righteousness that He provides reverses the
    process that leads from sin to death. Jesus, the Creator and Sustainer,
    refuses to give Satan, the usurper, unchallenged control over His cre-
    ation, including nature as well as humanity. He is willing to extend Him-
    self in the redemptive effort in order to prevent Satan from assuming con-
    trol.
       In spite of the seeming insignificance of this world compared to God's
    universe, Heaven has not abandoned us. This planet has become the the-
    ater of the universe. God is not through with planet Earth! It is His pur-
    pose to demonstrate through His dealing with humanity the unchanging
    principles that are the foundation of His universal government.
       Our hope centers in the fact that the God who is our Creator and Sus-
    tainer also has become our Redeemer. He never wearies in His determi-
    nation to rescue us, and the world itself, from the bondage to sin that
    resulted when our first parents sold themselves to Satan and sin.

Part 3 ® Miraculous Protection
      "It is of the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, because his com-
    passions fail not. They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness"
    (Lam. 3:22, 23).

      A planet under bondage and under the threat of extinction needs pro-
    tection. Human existence is a fragile thing. Scientists tell us that a rise in
    temperature of two or three degrees at the North and South Poles would
    cause worldwide flooding. They have warned that hydrocarbon emis-
    sions and other pollutants will one day upset the delicate balance in the
    atmosphere. We could go on. Suffice it to say, the mediatorial work of
    Christ includes the globe and its inhabitants. Sin's penalty (death) would
    have been exacted as soon as Adam and Eve sinned if there had been no
    plan of salvation. But Christ interposed. He shielded our first parents
    from immediate death and placed the planet under His protection.
       The Bible speaks of God's steadfast love. The Hebrew term chesed
    means "loving-kindness," "devotion," "loyalty," "fidelity." It occurs
    in one form or another about 245 times in the Old Testamnent. In 177
    instances it seems to convey the idea of solidarity or stability, as in God's
    covenant relationship with His people.

       What basic attribute of God underlies His relationship to the earth and its
     inhabitants? Gen. 9:16, 17.


        God's steadfast love forms the basis of His dealings with humanity.
     This is expressed in His covenant with "all flesh." The everlasting cov-
     enant embraces more than Israel or the church. Whether or not human
     beings acknowledge God's sovereignty, He extends His mercies to them.
     Christ's mediatorial ministry protects even the rebellious during proba-
     tionary time.

       Given the terrible nature and consequences of sin and its constant threat
     to survival, how can we explain the fact that the earth and its inhabitants
     have survived this long? 2 Peter 3:9.


       The word slack in this text means "to delay" or "loiter." It can also
     mean "to loosen one's grasp." The purposes of God for planet Earth are
     unchanged by centuries of time. Expressed in His covenant, God's pur-
     poses know no haste or delay. The planet is preserved in order to give the
     people in it opportunity to turn to God in repentance. Christ has not for
     one day or even one moment given up on the human race and planet
     Earth. He stood in the breach at Eden, and He has extended His miracu-
     lous protection ever since. He has the entire world in His hands. No part
     of the lost possession is beyond the reach of the Mediator.
                                                                                23

Part 4 — Seeds of Destruction
      "The wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat
    of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away" (Ps.
    37:20).

       One thing can be said about the nature of sin. It is highly inflammable
    and combustible. Left to itself, sin will self-destruct. (See Isa. 9:18; Isa.
    1:31; Prov. 13:6.)
       It is the hand of a merciful God alone that prevents total destruction.
       "God forbears, for a time, the full execution of the sentence of death
    pronounced upon man. Satan flattered himself that he had forever broken
    the link between heaven and earth. But in this he was greatly mistaken
    and disappointed. The Father had given the world into the hands of His
    Son for Him to redeem from the curse and the disgrace of Adam's failure
    and fall."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 1,
    p. 1085.

      What can we learn from Genesis 6:5, 6, about the moral condition that
    prevailed before the Flood?


       D. L. Moody used to say that sin leaped into the world full grown; the
    first boy born became a murderer. It is true that it does not take sin long
    to develop and ripen. The destructiveness of sin is illustrated amply in the
    experience of the pre-Flood generations. Moral degeneracy set in rap-
    idly. They gave themselves over to unbridled and unrestrained passions.
    Romans 1:18-32 traces the moral decline. Read this entire passage and
    determine for yourself whether it applies to society today.

     What led God to make the decision to destroy by a flood most of the hu-
    man race that then existed? Gen. 6:7.


       God is faithful and loyal, but sin has its consequences. Love is never
    harsh or cruel, but it is just. Love works ceaselessly to save sinners, but
    is just as determined to overcome evil. Those who continue to reject
    God's love will find that love will become wrath to them. Even God's
    destruction of evil is a loving act.
       Christ, through Noah, came and preached to the antediluvians. "It was
    His voice that spoke to the inhabitants of the old world in messages of
    warning, reproof, and invitation."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A.
    Bible Commentary, vol. I, p. 1089. God made extraordinary efforts to
    save the antediluvians. But at last the blight of sin covered the earth com-
    pletely. The experience of the pre-Flood generation, like that of Sodom
    and Gomorrah, is an illustration of the deadly nature of sin.

Part 5 — For Unfallen Worlds Too
      "Thou, even thou, art Lord alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of
    heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the
    seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them all; and the host of
    heaven worshippeth thee" (Neh. 9:6).

      Ours is not the only inhabited planet. The universe is neither silent nor
    without inhabitants. Some of the most fascinating passages of Ellen
    White's writings draw back the curtain just a bit on these "unfallen
    worlds." We also see hints of life on other planets in such scriptural pas-
    sages as Revelation 12:12; Job 1:6; 2:1, and Hebrews 1:2.
       "God's government included not only the inhabitants of heaven, but of
    all the worlds that He had created; and Lucifer had concluded that if he
    could carry the angels of heaven with him in rebellion, he could carry also
    all the worlds."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 41.

       What biblical evidence can be found to support the suggestion that Christ
     created other inhabited worlds? Col. 1:16; Heb. 1:2.


       These texts are cited to remind us once again that Jesus Christ is a
     universal Creator and universal Redeemer. The frame of reference for the
     great controversy is the entire cosmos. Prophets (see-ers) have the ad-
     vantage of God's perspective. They talk about sin being eradicated from
     the universe. Christ's lordship is to be exercised over the entirety of His
     vast creation. "Christ is mediating in behalf of man, and the order of un-
     seen worlds also is preserved by His mediatorial work."—Messages to
     Young People, p. 254.

       What does Revelation 12:12 indicate about the significance to other
     worlds of Christ's victory on the cross?


        From their vantage point the beings on other planets have seen it all.
     The Fall, the Flood, the Exodus, the building of the tabernacle at Sinai,
     the entire history of the Jewish nation, the coming of Christ, His crucifix-
     ion, resurrection, and ascension. Their attention is riveted on planet
     Earth and Christ's work in the heavenly sanctuary. As the conflict nears
     its close, they must be all the more anxious for final victory. And above
     all, they are grateful to the One whose strong arm kept them from the
     power of the evil one. The great controversy theme holds together the
     various doctrines and truths of our message in a beautiful and harmoni-
     ous system. This theme is unique and crucial in understanding the effects
     that sin in this world has brought to unfallen worlds.

                                       Mediation—A Universal Need

Part 6 — Focus and Application
      "Thou, 0 tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion,
    unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to
    the daughter of Jerusalem" (Micah 4:8).

      The plan of salvation provides for full restoration of the lost dominion
    that Adam sold out to Satan. Initially Adam was given dominion over the
    earth. The command was, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the
    earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over
    the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the
    earth" (Gen. 1:28). But Adam was not absolute owner. He merely was
    steward, God's representative. God still is the landlord. The earth is the
    Lord's. The creation that came from His hand characterized with such
    loveliness and beauty has been purchased back, has been redeemed, by
    the same hand that made it.

      What applications can you draw from the extent of what is to be recov-
    ered? Luke 19:10.


       Through sin Adam and Eve lost (1) eternal life—they no longer had the
    right to eat of the fruit of the tree; (2) their Eden home—they were evicted
    and an angel placed at the gate with a flaming sword; (3) their covering of
    light—sin brought them consciousness of their spiritual nakedness; and
    (4) the privilege of open communion with God. It is the object and pur-
    pose of Christ's mediation to restore, to redeem, to purchase, and to buy
    back. To seek indicates the necessity for the.Saviour to leave heaven, to
    move out of the element of glory and into the veil of flesh. To save is to
    make salvation secure by mediating His own life and character to repen-
    tant sinners. Eden will be populated once again with holy, happy beings
    whose lost estate has been recovered.

      What else is included in the rescue-recovery mission, and who directs it?
    Eph. 1:10.



    APPLICATION: Try this exercise:
      You have a friend who is an atheist. He sees events determined by the

    explain to him your confidence in a concerned God who is overseeing the
    function of the universe? Let your statement reflect concepts from this

What Our
Mediator Does
MEMORY TEXT: "Now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are
made nigh by the blood of Christ" (Eph. 2:13).

   A mediator brings about a change in relationships. He does this by first
removing the cause for hostility. " 'Mediation' in its broadest sense may
be defined as the act of intervening between parties at variance for the
purpose of reconciling them."—James On, general editor, The Interna-
tional Standard Bible Encyclopedia (Grand Rapids, Mich: William B.
Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1939), p. 2018. Thus reconciliation is at
the heart of mediation. There must be, at all costs, a change in relation-
ships. Jesus, our Mediator, does this by pouring out His soul in death,
giving Himself freely.
   What Christ has done can be illustrated in a limited way by the story of
the father and son who became estranged. The situation worsened to the
point where the son left the home, threatening never to return. The father
 responded by saying that he never wanted to see the son again. During
the intervening years, there was no contact between them until the
 mother became dangerously ill. She pleaded to see her son once again.
 Relenting, the father sent for him. The son came home. Father and son
 stood on opposite sides of the bed. Weak and sinking fast, the mother
 took the father's hand and the son's hand and, with one last dying effort,
joined their hands in hers. That is what reconciliation is like.
    Of course no story really can tell it all. Human illustrations break down
 at some point. This one does when we try to make the human father in the
 story represent God the Father in every respect. The Father hates sin but
 not the sinner. Mediation is not necessary to appease an angry God.
 Where the story is on target is in the mother's earnest desire for reconcili-
 ation, even as the last act of her life. As His last act our divine Mediator
 gave His life in order that mediation could be effected. In fact, Father and
 Son joined in giving Themselves in the supreme effort to redeem lost hu-
 manity.




                                                                           27

                                              What Our Mediator Does

Part 1 — He Reconciles
      "You, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked
    works, yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to
    present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight" (Col.
    1:21, 22).

       There are overtones and connotations in the term mediator that sug-
    gest broker, negotiator, interpreter, spokesman, attorney, advocate, and
    even guarantor. The term is a broad one. The mediator is the peacemaker
    who brings the alienated parties together. The mediator needs to know
    both parties. He also needs to know what is the cause of the estrange-
    ment. If the mediator is to be successful he cannot be part of the problem.
    He must have the respect and trust of the parties he hopes to bring to a
    reconciliation. He also should have a personal interest in the persons to
    be reconciled. The personal risk factor cannot be avoided.
       Even this description of the mediator and his function but faintly illus-
    trates the all-sufficient ministry of Jesus, the "one mediator between God
    and men" (1 Tim. 2:5). For our purposes in this lesson we will consider
    the primary function of the mediator to be that of reconciler—the one
    who brings the alienated parties together.

      In what way is God the Father involved in the work of reconciliation?
    2 Cor. 5:19.


       It is love that reconciles, and we can be assured that Father, Son, and
    Holy Spirit love us equally. We must not think of reconciliation as the
    Son feeling sorry for lost humanity and begging the angry Father to give
    the child another chance. There is no division in the Godhead's attitude
    or feeling toward human beings. Although it was Christ who gave His life
    to and for us, God the Father also joined in paying that infinite price. It is
    He who has placed Christ at His altar of mediation.
       "God's appointments and grants in our behalf are without limit. The
    throne of grace is itself the highest attraction because occupied by One
    who permits us to call Him Father. But God did not deem the principle of
    salvation complete while invested only with His own love. By His ap-
    pointment He has placed at His altar an Advocate clothed with our na-
    ture. As our Intercessor, His office work is to introduce us to God as His
    sons and daughters."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 363.
       All of the New Testament passages that speak about reconciliation rep-
    resent God as the One who reconciles the human race to Himself through
    Jesus Christ. Jesus established a new relation to God by an act—His
    death on the cross. That act became the basis for our new relationship to
    God. Two estranged persons become as one. Hence the word atonement,
    "at-one-ment." The point to be remembered is that God took the initia-
    tive. He did not wait for us to request Him to intervene.

                                             What Our Mediator Does

Part 2 — He Removes the Cause
      "Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we,
    being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were
    healed" (1 Peter 2:24). (Compare 1 John 3:5.)

       Because sin is the alienating factor it had to be removed before there
    could be reconciliation. Doing so involved Christ's death for our sins,
    which Paul says is the heart of the gospel—the good news. "For I deliv-
    ered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died
    for our sins according to the scriptures" (1 Cor. 15:3). The Son of God
    came on a search-and-destroy mission. He entered Satan's dominion, de-
    feated him on his own ground, and destroyed the enemy's stronghold.
    Sin, which seemed to be such an immovable barrier, can now be re-
    moved, taken away. "The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all"
    (Isa. 53:6). The cause for estrangement is removed. Christ has dealt ef-
    fectively with sin. He has shorn it of its power and ultimately will remove
    its sting.

      How does the term Lamb of God apply to Christ's mission? John 1:29.


       In the Jewish economy "the sacrificial lamb" came to be another name
    for "Sin Bearer." Jesus Himself was instructed by the slaying of lambs.
    When He visited Jerusalem for the first time, He came in contact with the
    doctors of the law who had an entirely wrong concept of the Messiah's
    mission. There "He beheld the bleeding victim upon the altar of sacrifice.
    With the worshipers He bowed in prayer, while the cloud of incense as-
    cended before God. He witnessed the impressive rites of the paschal ser-
    vice. Day by day He saw their meaning more clearly. Every act seemed
    to be bound up with His own life. New impulses were awakening within
    Him. Silent and absorbed, He seemed to be studying out a great problem.
    The mystery of His mission was opening to the Saviour."—The Desire of
    Ages, p. 78.
       Four times outside of the book of Revelation the New Testament ap-
    plies the word lamb to Christ as the One who suffers, the Just for the
    unjust, and dies in our stead to atone for sin. There is atoning power in the
     Lamb and His sacrifice. But when we come to the book of Revelation,
    the figure of the Lamb becomes central. It is used 28 times. He is de-
     picted as Redeemer (Rev. 14:4), as Judge (Rev. 6:16), as King (Rev.
    17:14), and as Victor (Rev. 14:1).
       Jesus is the Lamb-Priest who unites in Himself the victim who is sacri-
    ficed and the Priest who is the offerer. He has prevailed and thus has all
     power. His victory is unlimited, final, and complete.

                                              What Our Mediator Does

Part 3 — He Pays the Price
      "Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he
    might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the
    Spirit" (1 Peter 3:18).

       The removal of sin necessitated the death of the Sin Bearer. His was
    not to be ordinary death, but He was to taste what it would mean for the
    sinner to be eternally separated from God. The Mediator must not only
    bear the sin but also its full penalty. However, the suffering of Christ was
    not to be confined to the experiences immediately preceding His death.
    Throughout His lifetime the Saviour's suffering from contact with sin was
    intense. The current of His life was in direct opposition to the immorality
    of the society of His day.

      What significance do you see in the term the Bible uses to describe the
    penalty of sin? Rom. 6:23.


      The penalty for sin is spoken of as "wages." The sinner deserves the
    penalty. God's gift, eternal life, is totally undeserved. It is all of grace.
    The wages we earn by sinning was paid by the Mediator on our behalf.
    "In death He was more than conqueror. The redemption price has been
    paid."—Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p.
    1149.

      How does a word Jesus used help us better understand the nature of His
    sacrifice? Matt. 20:28.


       The price of our salvation also is called a "ransom." Ransom is a term
    that comes from the slave market. The human race is sold under sin. The
    result is that we find ourselves in the most absolute bondage. But Jesus
    was willing to pay the unbelievable ransom price—His own life.
       "Justice and mercy stood apart, in opposition to each other, separated
    by a wide gulf. The Lord our Redeemer clothed his divinity with human-
    ity, and wrought out in behalf of man a character that was without spot or
    blemish. He planted his cross midway between heaven and earth, and
    made it the object of attraction which reached both ways, drawing both
    Justice and Mercy across the gulf. Justice moved from its exalted throne,
    and with all the armies of heaven approached the cross. There it saw One
    equal with God bearing the penalty for all injustice and sin. With perfect
    satisfaction Justice bowed in reverence at the cross, saying It is
    enough."—Ellen G. White, General Conference Bulletin, Fourth Quar-
    ter, 1899, p. 102.
       It is dangerous to think of the ransom provided in Jesus as appease-
    ment. The God of the Christian faith needs no appeasement.

                                              What Our Mediator Does

Part 4 — He Destroys the Destroyer
      "Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also
    himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy
    him that had the power of death, that is, the devil" (Heb. 2:14).

       In essence, the death of Christ destroyed Satan's kingdom. It pulled
    down the twin pillars, sin and death. The prison house of sin collapsed,
    and death is a defeated foe, although the ultimate victory over death still
    is to come. The captives are set free. The Mediator prevails, the enemy is
    vanquished. "For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he
    might destroy the works of the devil" (1 John 3:8).
       Satan is a defeated foe! John declared, "I heard a loud voice saying in
    heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our
    God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast
    down, which accused them before our God day and night" (Rev. 12:10).

    SEARCH AND LEARN: How do the texts that follow demonstrate that
    Christ has been victor in every encounter with Satan?

       Rev. 12:7-9

       Jude 9

       Matt. 4:1-11

        The individual battles that make up the great controversy between
     Christ and Satan became particularly fierce during Jesus' earthly exis-
     tence. At the time of each battle our salvation hung in the balance. In
     both the wilderness and Gethsemane, Christ came close to death. In fact,
     He would have died had it not been for divine intervention. But such in-
     tervention did not take place at the time of the decisive encounter at Cal-
     vary. "Having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them
     openly, triumphing over them in it" (Col. 2:15). "As Christ in His expir-
     ing agony upon the cross cried out, 'It is finished' (John 19:30), a shout of
     triumph rang through every world and through heaven itself. The great
     contest that had been so long in progress in this world was now decided,
     and Christ was conqueror."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 69, 70.

       When and under what circumstances will Satan ultimately be destroyed?
     Rev. 20:7-10.


       Although Satan still exists, his destruction will take place at the end of
     the judgment, at the close of the millennium.

                                             What Our Mediator Does

Part 5 — He Provides Repentance and Forgiveness
      "Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour,
    for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins" (Acts 5:31).

      Repentance for sin should not be considered a natural human trait. It
    comes to us as a gift from God. It is something that is provided. The bibli-
    cal injunctions to repent are numerous.

    SEARCH AND LEARN: Study Matthew 3:2; Luke 13:3; Acts 2:38; 3:19;
    17:30; then formulate your own simple definition of repentance. Write it
    below:




       Repentance is humanly impossible because, in the first place, we do
    not, of ourselves, understand the nature of sin, its depths, and its power.
    Human sorrow or remorse comes from experiencing the results and the
    consequences. Genuine repentance leads to a complete about-face, a
    turnabout of 180 degrees—a complete reorientation of life. As the gate-
    way to new life in Christ, repentance forms an important link in the salva-
    tion process.

      Because human beings are incapable of repentance or even of recognizing
    their own sins, how is this work essential to salvation accomplished for
    them? John 16:7-11.


       It is impossible to overestimate the value of the Holy Spirit's work. He
    brings conviction of sin to the human heart. He affects the conscience,
    making it sensitive and responsive.
      Forgiveness is free, but it is not cheap. God is not indifferent toward
    sin. How could He be, when it caused the death of His Son and so much
    suffering and pain and death since its inception? But God was willing to
    pay the full price of our forgiveness and, through Christ, has purchased
    the right to freely forgive our sins.
      Repentance and forgiveness are bound together. Repentance is the sig-
    nal that forgiveness already has been made available through the Media-
    tor's work on our behalf. God is justified in granting forgiveness to those
    who have repented. (See Eph. 1:7.)
      While the work of the Mediator has universal overtones in that it af-
    fects even the future of unfallen worlds and makes the position of the
    angels eternally secure, it is nonetheless personal. We must not place the
    Mediator's work on a purely theoretical basis. It must come down to
    where we are, so that we can relate gratefully to Him.

                                              What Our Mediator Does

Part 6 — Focus and Application
      "[God] hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly
    places in Christ Jesus" (Eph. 2:6).

      The Mediator brings about new relationships. He removes the cause
    for estrangement. At a great price He paid our ransom and now stands in
    our place, thus releasing us from the sentence of death. He grappled with
    the destroyer and his prison house, bringing it down by His death. He
    earned the right to snatch the victims from destruction. Rebels who ac-
    cept His gracious offer are now friends, loyal subjects. There is no more
    hostility to God's law. A spirit of loving obedience replaces an attitude of
    resistance. Those who were afar are now brought near.

      Summarize in your own words the description of the radical change of
    status found in Colossians 1:13.




       Delivered, "to draw off," "to rescue." Translated, "to transport,"
     "to remove," or in some instances "to transplant." These strong words
     indicate a dramatic transformation, a clean break with the past, and a
     new, exciting future. Drawn out and rescued from the kingdom of dark-
     ness, Christians are transplanted into the kingdom of grace.

       Read Romans 8:1-14. Notice the contrasts: "after the flesh," "after the
     Spirit." Two possibilities are indicated here—life on two levels. The
     lower level is the level of enmity against God. Here are the unreconciled
     who are "not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be" (verse 7).
     The upper level is the way of the Spirit, to be "in Christ." This is the level
     of new relationships, the level of new life. Those who are in the flesh
     cannot please God (verse 8). Those in the new relationship (in Christ) are
     the sons and daughters of God. (See verse 14.) The new standing before
     God is more than a matter of bookkeeping. God does more than wipe the
     slate clean. Salvation is more than a legal status. It involves allowing the
     Holy Spirit to bring our lives into harmony with the divine will and law.

     APPLICATION: Too often our lives are marked by isolation and es-
     trangement from those we should be close 10. This happens in the family.
     It happens in the church.
        Are you aware of a breaking or broken relationship that should be
     healed? Identify to yourself the person from whom you sense separation.
     Identify the problem.
        What procedures could you follow to involve Jesus as Mediator to
     bring reconciliation? Write out these steps. Are you willing to involve
     Jesus?

Jesus' Qualifications
MEMORY TEXT: "One of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the
Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the
book, and to loose the seven seals thereof" (Rev. 5:5).

   Revelation 5 provides high drama. One is pictured sitting upon the
throne holding a scroll in His hand. The scroll is shut tight, sealed with
seven seals. A powerful angel challenges, "Who is worthy to open the
book?" A universal search party finds no one worthy, no one powerful
enough to do so. Evidently the book is a most important one because
John weeps as though his heart is about to break when no one can be
found to open it. More than curiosity is involved.
   "In the context of Revelation, this will or testament would be a title-
deed, as it were to man's lost inheritance which has been repurchased by
Christ the Lamb. Thus the scroll is a book of destiny. The opening of it
means inheritance in God's kingdom, its remaining closed means forfei-
ture."—Kenneth Strand, The Open Gates of Heaven (Ann Arbor, Mich:
Ann Arbor Publishers, 1972), p. 50.
   At last the prophet is told, "You may now stop weeping. We have
found one who is worthy, equal to the task. He is the Lion of Judah's
tribe, the Root of David, the Lamb that was slain." Jesus qualifies be-
cause He is equal to God in dignity, in power, in every respect.
   "He came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon
the throne" (Rev. 5:7).
   Jesus also qualifies to open the book because He is the Lamb, a repre-
sentative of the human race, the God who took upon Himself human na-
ture that He might experience for us the second death that we deserve.
   Angels desire to look into the deep mysteries of the plan of salvation,
but even angels are limited by their creatureliness. It took One who has
the ability and power both to create and to completely destroy to break
the seals, reveal the plan, and bring salvation to the fallen race.
   We have heard a joyful sound,
     Jesus saves, Jesus saves;
   Spread the gladness all around,
     Jesus saves, Jesus saves.
        —Pricilla J. Owens,
        The Church Hymnal, no. 637.

                                                    Jesus' Qualifications

Part 1 — Next of Kin
       "If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his posses-
    sion, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that
    which his brother sold" (Lev. 25:25).

        Under Mosaic law it was both the duty and the privilege of the nearest
     of kin to redeem a property that had been lost by an unfortunate relative.
     Of course, the nearest of kin must be able to purchase the property. This
     person came to be known as the kinsman-redeemer, and the law that out-
     lined the practice was called the law of the kinsman-redeemer. There is a
     marvelous typology here. Jesus, our Mediator, became next of kin to the
     human family that He might redeem us. To redeem is literally "to buy
     back." He takes responsibility for the transaction. He is willing and able
     to pay the full purchase price. Adam forfeited his right to the inheritance
     and was dispossessed. His posterity shares his fate.

       In what way can we say that Jesus is next of kin to humanity? John 1:13,
     14; Heb. 2:11, 12.


       Some people are extremely proud of their bloodline. Family tree and
     heritage mean a great deal to them. Christians can confidently say that
     they are kin to Jesus Christ. It was our blood that ran in His veins.
       "But not to any class is Christ's love restricted. He identifies Himself
     with every child of humanity. That we might become members of the
     heavenly family, He became a member of the earthly family. He is the
     Son of man, and thus a brother to every son and daughter of Adam. His
     followers are not to feel themselves detached from the perishing world
     around them. They are a part of the great web of humanity; and Heaven
     looks upon them as brothers to sinners as well as to saints."—The Desire
     of Ages, p. 638.

       What particularly identifies us as being members of Jesus' family? Matt.
     12:49, 50.


       Jesus becomes brother in a very special way to those who accept Him
     as Saviour and do the will of His Father. Our heavenly Kinsman has pur-
     chased eternal life for all mankind. But not all have acknowledged Him;
     many even deny Him. He will not force allegiance.

       What action on our part is essential in order for us to become members of
     Christ's redeemed family? Matt. 10:32; Rom. 10:9, 10; Rev. 21:7.




                                                                              35

                                                     Jesus' Qualifications

Part 2 — Complete Identity With Us
       "Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his breth-
    ren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining
    to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people" (Heb. 2:17).

       The Son of God became the Son of man. He became part and parcel of
    humanity. One teaching during the early Christian era held that Jesus
    merely appeared to be human—His earthly life' was a masquerade. The
    Scriptures deny this vigorously. Ellen White also makes it clear: "Christ
    did not make believe take human nature."—Review and Herald, April 5,
    1906.
       "Our Saviour took humanity with all its liabilities. He took the nature
    of man, with the possibility of yielding to temptation."—The Desire of
    Ages, p. 117.
       Not only did Jesus take our humanity while He was here on earth, but
    He took it for all eternity. "Christ ascended to heaven, bearing a sancti-
    fied, holy humanity. He took this humanity with him into the heavenly
    courts, and through the eternal ages he will bear it, as One who has re-
    deemed every human being in the city of God."—Ellen G. White, Re-
    view and Herald, March 9, 1905.

      What was the import of Jesus' favorite designation or title for Himself
    found in Luke 19:10?


       The primary meaning of the phrase "Son of man" is simply "human
    being." Jesus went to great lengths to emphasize His identity with hu-
    manity. He refused the trappings of royalty. He grew up "as a root out of
    a dry ground: he hath no form or comeliness; and when we shall see him,
    there is no beauty that we should desire him" (Isa. 53:2). He was at home
    with the poor. He knew a life of toil and hardship. His hands were
    calloused. He wore a simple peasant's garment. It is hard to imagine a
    greater condescension, a greater demonstration of identification with suf-
    fering humanity.

    SEARCH AND LEARN: Read Isaiah 53 carefully and list some of the ways
    that Jesus identified with humanity. In what ways is He different from other
    human beings?

                                                     Jesus' Qualifications

Part 3 — Special Helper
      "In that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour
    them that are tempted" (Heb. 2:18).

       By His unique experience, Jesus our Mediator is well qualified to help
     us. He knows us intimately. He has walked the path before us. He has
     entered fully and completely into the human situation.

       Why was it necessary for Jesus to suffer? Heb. 2:10; 5:8, 9.


       Jesus accepted trials and temptations so as to equip Himself better for
     His mediatorial ministry. He refused to claim exemption from hardship.
     He was not a stranger to hard work. There were no servants to wait on
     Him in His Nazareth home. He knew poverty and loneliness. His own
     family thought Him rather odd. Few ever understood His mission. Then
     there was the intense, mean, thoroughly unwarranted hostility that He
     faced. He was the special target of Satan's attacks, the focal point. He
     accepted all of this in good spirit, never complaining or murmuring.
        "Jesus knows the circumstances of every soul. You may say, I am sin-
     ful, very sinful. You may be; but the worse you are, the more you need
     Jesus. He turns no weeping, contrite one away. He does not tell to any all
     that He might reveal, but He bids every trembling soul take courage.
     Freely will He pardon all who come to Him for forgiveness and restora-
     tion."—The Desire of Ages, p. 568.

       How is this special help experienced in the life of the believer? 1 Cor.
     10:13.


        Christ has accepted a unique relationship and responsibility to the
     Christian. We have become members of His family. He has made prom-
     ises to all who trust in Him. He knows how to deliver the godly out of
     temptation. (See 2 Peter 2:9.) He is our special Helper. He is more than
     sympathetic to us. He is capable of giving us specific help when we need
     it.
         A Saviour who simply feels sorry for us cannot qualify. A Saviour who
     merely identifies with us is inadequate. Only a Saviour who can bring
     practical help to poor mortals can meet our needs. This Saviour, who is
     our Mediator, actually lifts the fallen, strengthens the weak, and revives
     the faint.

Part 4 — Perfect Sinlessness
       "Even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leav-
     ing us an example, that ye should follow his steps: who did no sin, neither
     was guile found in his mouth: who, when he was reviled, reviled not again;
     when he suffered, he threatened not: but committed himself to him that
     judgeth righteously" (1 Peter 2:21-23).

        While truly human, Jesus is "holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from
     sinners" (Heb. 7:26). His perfection of character is unassailable. After
     living for many years in the little country of Palestine, in full view of all
     kinds of people, He challenged one and all, "Which of you convinceth me
     of sin?" (John 8:46). Only a spotless lamb was to be offered. The priest
     was charged to examine each sacrifice. The Father found no fault in
     Christ, nor could His disciples. Even Pilate's wife called Him a just man
     and Pilate said, "I find no fault in him" (Luke 23:14). One of the dying
     thieves insisted that He had committed no crime. The demons called
     Him, appropriately, the Holy One of God.

      What characterized Christ's attitude toward righteousness and iniquity?
     Heb. 1:9.


       Christ was not soft on sin. He upbraided Pharisees and Saducees for
     their wrongdoing. It appears that to Him man's inhumanity to man was
     the greatest sin. He hated iniquity. At the same time, Jesus and the righ-
     teous principles expressed in His Father's law are synonymous. Jeremiah
     called Him the Lord our righteousness (Jer. 23:6). He and righteousness
     were at home together. His life was so pure and sinless that He "con-
     demned sin in the flesh" (Rom. 8:3). He convinces the world of righ-
     teousness, that is, He sets before the universe the perfect example of a
     righteous life. He becomes the measurement, the test of what righteous-
     ness is.
       Even as He faced the cross and death, unable to see through the grave,
     there was no responsive cord to the wiles of Satan; there were no sympa-
     thetic vibrations, no point of agreement, no attachment or affinity what-
     ever.
       "He met the arch apostate face to face, and single-handed withstood
     the foe of his throne. Not even by a thought could Christ be brought to
     yield to the power of temptation. Satan finds in human hearts some point
     where he can gain a foot-hold; some sinful desire is cherished, by means
     of which his temptations assert their power. But Christ declared of him-
     self, 'The prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.' "—
     Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, Nov. 8, 1887.

       To what extent can Christ's temptations be compared with ours? Heb.
     4:15.

Part 5 — Combination of Justice and Mercy
      "I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and
    in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven
    horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all
    the earth" (Rev. 5:5, 6).

      Jesus is the only One who reveals perfectly to us all the attritubes of the
    Godhead. Angels cannot do this. The Father and the Holy Spirit remain
    invisible to normal human vision. Jesus, who was in the bosom of the
    Father, alone can reveal God's character to the human race. He is the
    God of unlimited power and also infinite mercy. He places His great
    power under the control of His steadfast love.
      Satan misrepresents God's character. At times He pictures Him as a
    God of justice without mercy. At other times he portrays Him as a God of
    mercy at the expense of His justice. Because he does, the human family
    had to be given a demonstration of God's true character. Jesus filled that
    role. In Him was and is to be found the perfect blend of mercy and justice.
    He is the Lion of strength and power as well as the Lamb of silent suffer-
    ing. In Him self-giving love is combined with omnipotence and unlimited
    power with the kind of justice that never strains out the quality of mercy.
    The fusion of divinity with humanity is unique in Christ. Indeed, in all
    heaven and earth, there is none like Him. There never has been, there
    never will be. The light of heaven shone through Christ as through a crys-
    tal prism, and today we still see in Him the full glory of God.

      To what extent was the human Christ able to reflect the glory of His Fa-
    ther? Heb. 1:2, 3.


       "Looking upon Christ in the flesh we look upon God in humanity, and
    see in him the brightness of divine glory, the express image of God the
    Father."—Ellen G. White, Youth's Instructor, "Child Life of Jesus,"
    Nov. 21, 1895.
       As we look on His compassion, we know that there is mercy. As we
    see Him dying to satisfy the claims of the broken law, we know that there
    is justice. But, in the person of our Saviour, we also see that "mercy and
    truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other"
    (Ps. 85:10). An unusual fountain, lined with mirrors, can be found in one
    of the great cathedrals of Europe. The entire interior of the church is mir-
    rored in this small fountain and can be seen in detail. This harmonizes
    with the word picture used in Hebrews 1:3: "Who being the brightness of
    his glory, and the express image of his person." In Jesus we see mirrored
    perfectly all that God is, and we are moved to love and trust Him.

Part 6 — Focus and Application
      "Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive
    power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and
    blessing" (Rev. 5:12).

      Revelation 4 and 5 take us into heaven's throne room. Chapter 4 em-
    phasizes God's creative power. He is worthy to be praised because He
    has created (Rev. 4:11). The emphasis in chapter 5 is on redemption. The
    worshipers praise the Lamb: "Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to
    God by thy blood" (Rev. 5:9). He is the One altogether lovely, the fairest
    among ten thousand. All the angels in heaven burst forth in a shout of
    praise, "Worthy is the Lamb."

      What signal honor did the Father confer on the divine-human Son? Heb.
    1:6.


      The Son not only is worthy of our admiration but of our praise and
    worship as well. Christ is in all things to "have the preeminence" (Col.
    1:18).

    SEARCH AND LEARN: Match Christ's roles given below with the most
    appropriate text listed:

            Our only Advocate.               A. John 6:35
            Our only remedy.                 B. 1 Cor. 3:11
            Our only nourishment.            C. 1 John 2:1
            Our only Source of truth.        D. Acts 4:12
            Our only Saviour                 E. John 14:6
            Our only Foundation              F. John 3:14, 15

       In Hebrews 13:15 praise is likened to sacrifice. No longer does God
    require animal sacrifices. First and foremost He requires us to give our-
    selves to Him and to do so with grateful hearts and thankful spirits. This
    is the kind of sacrifice that pleases our heavenly Father. However, it
    should be remembered that our sacrifice is acceptable only through Jesus
    Christ our Lord. It is His righteousness that makes our offering fragrant
    and gives it merit.

    APPLICATION:
      • In what ways can I show my appreciation for God's great gift?
      o What practical steps can I take to make the truths we have been
      studying more vivid and real?
     • When did I last speak words of praise to God, to a friend, or to a
     neighbor?

Earthly Illustrations
MEMORY TEXT: "Moses returned unto the Lord, and said, Oh, this peo-
ple have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. Yet now, if
thou wilt forgive their sin—; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book
which thou hast written" (Ex. 32:31, 32).

   At times God has chosen human beings to represent in a special way
various aspects of Christ's saving ministry. Further, the office and func-
tion of the prophet, the priest, and the king in the Old Testament were to
illustrate Christ's multifaceted work as Mediator. Particularly in the Old
Testament the Bible deals in types. Bible scholars call this typology.
Types always point to the antitype (the real thing). The type is not an end
in itself. Neither was the type, the symbol, intended to teach every aspect
of Christ's all-sufficient ministry. Types and human agents provide only
limited reflectors of the unsurpassable glory of the Lord Jesus Christ. But
again, God mercifully gave us glimpses of redemption through these sym-
bols of salvation. God adjusts His way of communicating to our ability to
understand. It pleased Him to make human personality the vehicle of
knowledge about the One who was to come and make salvation com-
plete. His work is so all-encompassing, so many-sided, so exceedingly
broad, that not one of these persons chosen could adequately portray the
reality or reflect the full image. But the record is there for us to contem-
 plate.
   Looking at it from this side of the incarnation and Calvary, we see fac-
ets of Christ's character and mediatorial ministry in the types and figures
 of the Old Testament. Of course, Jesus is the full tapestry, the great
 whole. These earthly figures are but single strands, which, when brought
 together, do not begin to approach the One who is sum and substance—
 the all in all.
   But human and earthly types can be used by God to inform us about
 heavenly things. He uses people such a Abraham, Moses, and Samuel;
 offices, such as that of the prophet, priest, and king; and a most interest-
 ing accommodation to human need, the cities of refuge.

Part 1 — The Arbitrator
      "If only there were someone to arbitrate between us, to lay his hand upon
    us both" (Job. 9:33, NIV).

      Job felt keenly the need for someone to stand between him and the holy
    God. Realizing his own sinfulness, he exlaimed: "If I wash myself with
    snow water, and make my hands never so clean; yet shalt thou plunge me
    in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me" (Job 9:30, 31). He was
    aware of the distance that his sins put between him and God. "For he is
    not a man, as I am" (Job 9:32). His question is, "How should man be just
    with God?" (Job 9:2).
      Job needed desperately a go-between or arbitrator, someone to "lay
    his hand upon us both." "Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I
    might come even to his seat!" (Job 23:3).

      How did God, speaking through the prophet Ezekiel, express His need
    for a go-between? Eze. 22:30.


       Ezekiel pictures God as looking for a man to stand between Himself
    and the people. The holy God needs someone to stand between Him and
    sinners. However, human beings are inadequate to the task: "but I found
    none."
      "Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they
    should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord
    God" (Eze. 14:14).

       In Old Testament experience, even the best and strongest of men can-
    not guarantee Israel safe passage or salvation. If it were possible to com-
    bine all the righteousness of every good person who ever lived, it would
    still fall short of the divine requirements.

      What does Job's experience teach us about where we can find our Go-
    between? Job 19:25-27.


      Although at times Job was nearly overcome with despair, he worked
    his way through the maze to the place where he could voice one of the
    great affirmations of Scripture. He saw the Redeemer, Christ, through
    the eye of faith.
      The book of Job may be the oldest in the Bible. It is believed that Mo-
    ses wrote the account while tending his father-in-law's sheep on the
    plains of Midian. Job's faith was progressive, intelligent, and mature.
    From time immemorial the light of Christ's mediatorial ministry shone
    brightly on believers in God.

Part 2 — Abraham
       "Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous
    with the wicked? Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt
    thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are
    therein? That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous
    with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far
    from thee: shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? And the Lord said,
    If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the
    place for their sakes" (Gen. 18:23-26).

      Abraham was the kind of man God could use as a type of the Mediator.
    He was truly dependable. "I know him, that he will command his chil-
    dren and his household after him" (Gen. 18:19), is Heaven's character
    assessment. Because he was a man of compassion and benevolence, he
    sought earnestly to avert the disaster when he heard of Sodom's impend-
    ing destruction.

      What can we learn from Abraham's importunate pleading on behalf of
    the doomed city? Gen. 18:27-33.


      "With deep reverence and humility he urged his plea: 'I have taken
    upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes!' There
    was no self-confidence, no boasting of his own righteousness. He did not
    claim favor on the ground of his obedience, or of the sacrifices he had
    made in doing God's will. Himself a sinner, he pleaded in the sinner's
    behalf. Such a spirit all who approach God should possess. Yet Abraham
    manifested the confidence of a child pleading with a loved father. He
    came close to the heavenly Messenger, and fervently urged his peti-
    tion. . . .
      "Love for perishing souls inspired Abraham's prayer. While he
    loathed the sins of that corrupt city, he desired that the sinners might be
    saved. . . .
       "The spirit of Abraham was the spirit of Christ."—Patriarchs and
    Prophets, pp. 139, 140.
       Abraham could typify the Mediator because he knew Him and under-
    stood His ministry.

       What does Abraham's willingness to offer his son, Isaac, teach us about
    faith and obedience? Gen. 22:2, 12.

Part 3 — Moses
       "Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen
    stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should de-
    stroy them" (Ps. 106:23).

       Moses' entire life and ministry is an illustration of Christ's mediatorial
    work. Time and again he threw himself into the breach between God and
    the people. Moses' prayer for apostate Israel at the time of the golden calf
    idolatry is the highest example of human intercession. (See this week's
    memory verse.)
       "Moses realized how dreadful would be the fate of the sinner; yet if the
    people of Israel were to be rejected by the Lord, he desired his name to be
    blotted out with theirs; he could not endure to see the judgments of God
    fall upon those who had been so graciously delivered. The intercession of
    Moses in behalf of Israel illustrates the mediation of Christ for sinful men.
    But the Lord did not permit Moses to bear, as did Christ, the guilt of the
    transgressor."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 326, 327.

         What was Heaven's assessment of Moses' ministry? Deut. 34:10.


      "Moses was a type of Christ. He himself had declared to Israel, 'The
    Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of
    thy brethren, like unto me; unto Him ye shall hearken.' Deuteronomy
    18:15. God saw fit to discipline Moses in the school of affliction and pov-
    erty before he could be prepared to lead the hosts of Israel to the earthly
    Canaan."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 480.

       Study carefully the interesting parallels between Moses and Christ out-
    lined below:
       1. Both were preserved in childhood (Ex. 2:2-10; Matt. 2:13-15).
       2. Both fasted 40 days (Ex. 34:28; Matt. 4:2).
       3. Both at one time had radiant faces (Ex. 34:35; Matt. 17:2).
       4. Both endured murmurings (Ex. 15:24; Mark 7:2).
       5. Both made intercessory prayers (Ex. 32:32; John 17:9).
       6. Both spoke as oracles (Deut. 18:18; John 7:46).
       7. Both died before entering the heavenly Canaan (Matt. 17:3; Jude 9;
    Acts 1:11).

       God's manner of communication with Moses suggests that He saw in
    Moses a type of His Son. Open, face-to-face communion characterizes
    the relationship between the Father and the Son. As Moses led the
    Israelites out of Egypt, so Christ our Passover leads us from the darkness
    and bondage of sin to the marvelous light of freedom and liberty.

Part 4 — Samuel
      "Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in
    ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way"
    (1 Sam. 12:23).

      Samuel followed the pattern of Abraham and Moses in that he placed
    the people's interests above that of his own. These persons who are rec-
    ognized as types of Christ, breathed His spirit. They were unselfish.
    Their love for the people was unquestioned. Their sense of sin, its awful
    nature, and its terrible consequences heightened and intensified their
    prayers. Like their Example, they poured themselves out before God
    with strong crying on behalf of others.

      Note the steps to revival that can be found in the Mizpeh experience:
    1 Sam. 7:5-9.

      One way of summarizing these steps follows:
         1. Repentance and confession (verse 6).
         2. Recognition of deep need (verse 8).
         3. Commitment and dedication (verse 9).
         4. Intercessory prayer (verses 5-9).
      "There is need today of such a revival of true heart religion as was
    experienced by ancient Israel. Repentance is the first step that must be
    taken by all who would return to God. No one can do this work for an-
    other. We must individually humble our souls before God and put away
    our idols. When we have done all that we can do, the Lord will manifest
    to us His salvation."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 590.

       Why are Moses and Samuel linked together in Jeremiah 15:1?


        Samuel never wavered from his consistent course. He made the rounds
     "from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and
     judged Israel in all those places" (1 Sam. 7:16). In this respect he can be
     considered a type of the One who is the same yesterday, today, and for-
     ever. "In the character of Samuel we see reflected the likeness of
     Christ."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 607.
        Consistency is the characteristic that stands out in Samuel's life. No
     matter that the people were faithless, he kept the faith. He did not cease
     to pray for them. When Israel demanded a king, rejecting him as judge, he
     continued his ministry. He stood fearlessly before kings, princes, and
      common people, reminding them of their obligation to God. He saw Is-
      rael go from a government ruled directly by God to a monarchy ruled by
      faulty human beings. The attitude of the people, the condition of the king-
      dom, which often was in a sorry state of affairs, made no difference.

                                                                              45

Part 5 — Priests, Prophets, and Kings
       "Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call
     upon his name; they called upon the Lord, and he answered them" (Ps.
     99:6).

       Jesus serves as Prophet, Priest, and King. These Old Testament offices
     typify His ministry. In His function as prophet, Jesus makes God's will
     intelligible to man. As priest, He intercedes with the Father in our behalf.
     As king, He rules over a mediatorial kingdom that soon will merge into
     the kingdom of glory.
       The Prophet: "Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the
     land of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the
     prophets, daily rising up early and sending them" (Jer. 7:25). In a sense,
     prophets mediate the will of God and the knowledge of God to the people.
     They stand in the counsels of God, hear His word, and declare it.

       What was the central theme of the prophetic message? 1 Peter 1:10, 11.
     (See also Luke 24:27.)


       The Priest: "Take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with
     him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister unto me in
     the priest's office, even Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar,
     Aaron's sons" (Ex. 28:1). Priests were expected to intercede with God
     for the people. They also were types of Christ in His work as Sin Bearer.
     The high priest bore the names of the tribes of Israel on his breastplate.
     (See Ex. 28:29.) They were to be consecrated men of integrity.

       With what intensity were the priests to intercede for the people? Joel
     2:17.


        The priests were to place themselves between the altar and the wor-
     shipers. They were to lift their voices in earnest petition to God and to
     risk their lives in approaching God on Israel's behalf.
       The King: "Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion. I will
     declare the decree: the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day
     have I begotten thee" (Ps. 2:6, 7). Israel's ideal king was the Messiah, the
     One who should occupy David's throne.

       What was the significance of the sacred rite described in Exodus 29:7;
     1 Kings 19:16; and 1 Samuel 10:1 that was used to prepare prophet, priest,
     and king for office?

Part 6 ® Cities of Refuge
      • "The Lord also spake unto Joshua, saying, S ak to the children of Is-
     rael, saying, Appoint out for you cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you
     by the hand of Moses: that the slayer that killeth any person unawares and
     unwittingly may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge from the avenger
     of blood" (Joshua 20:1-3).

        The cities of refuge serve as a marvelous type of the refuge that sinners
     find in Christ. But they can be included among those lessons of the Jew-
     ish economy that are but dimly understood.

       How many cities were set apart, and how were they geographically lo-
     cated? Num. 35:6-14.


        "Six of the cities assigned to the Levites—three on each side [of] the
     Jordan—were appointed as cities of refuge, to which the manslayer might
     flee for safety. . . .
        "The cities of refuge were so distributed as to be within a half day's
     journey of every part of the land. The roads leading to them were always
     to be kept in good repair; all along the way signposts were to be erected
     bearing the word 'Refuge' in plain, bold characters, that the fleeing one
     might not be delayed for a moment. Any person—Hebrew, stranger, or
     sojourner—might avail himself of this provision."—Patriarchs and
     Prophets, p. 515.

       Accessibility is the lesson to be understood in the cities of refuge. Ev-
     erything about them suggests that the way is open.

     APPLICATION: "The cities of refuge appointed for God's ancient peo-
     ple were a symbol of the refuge provided in Christ. The same merciful
     Saviour who appointed those temporal cities of refuge has by the shed-
     ding of His own blood provided for the transgressors of God's law a sure
     retreat, into which they may flee for safety from the second death."—
     Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 516.
       There are many spiritual lessons that we may draw from these sym-
     bolic cities. But we should not lose sight of the purpose of this lesson, to
     point out how the work of the Mediator is mirrored in divinely appointed
     earthly figures and human activities.
       What special person has God used in your life to give you evidence of
     His care? How did this person get involved with your need? What forms
     did that ministry take?
        If that person is still living, why not send a note of appreciation. Let
     him or her know the results of that ministry in your life.


                                                                               47

Lessons From
the Sanctuary
MEMORY TEXT: "Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell
among them" (Ex. 25:8).

   The God of heaven seeks continually to reveal Himself to His earth-
born children. He is prompted by love. At the same time that He had to
expel Adam and Eve from Eden He revealed Himself to be a God of
mercy. He told them of the plan instituted for their redemption and even
provided a covering for them. In love He instituted the system of sacri-
fices that made it possible for sinners to approach Him. At first the sys-
tem was quite simple, yet suited to the age—a blood offering brought by
the penitent as an acknowledgment of sin and as a type that pointed to the
provision made for the atonement of sin.
   During the patriarchal age simple altars of sacrifice and worship dotted
the region from Mesopotamia to Egypt. Then came the day when God
spoke to Moses saying: "Let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell
among them" (Ex. 25:8). What followed came to be a most glorious rev-
elation of the character of God, a graphic representation of His way of
dealing with the sin problem, and a dramatic revelation of the heinous
nature of transgression. Notice the progression that took place from sim-
ple altars to elaborate systems and ultimately, in Solomon's temple, to a
resplendent building—God's house for all people.
   This week we take a brief look at the sanctuary system that pointed to
Jesus our Mediator and to His final work of judgment. Jesus instituted the
sanctuary in order that He might reveal Himself even more completely to
humanity.
   Seventh-day Adventists share many Bible truths with Christians of
other faiths. But, and we say it humbly, yet with conviction, God seems
to have left to us the articulation and proclamation of the sanctuary and
judgment truths that speak volumes about God to modern man. "The
heavenly sanctuary provides the remnant church with God's last message
to men prior to Christ's return. The sublime moral and spiritual heights to
which Christ calls His followers underline the supreme importance of this
judgment-hour message. The Christian church has not outgrown the
mediatorial ministry of Christ, which is more important today than ever
before."—Edward Heppenstall, Foreword, Our High Priest (Washing-
ton, D.C.: Review and Herald Publishing Association, 1972), p. 7.

                                           Lessons From the Sanctuary

Part 1 — A Type of the Heavenly Sanctuary
      "Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service, and
    a worldly sanctuary."
      "Which was a figure for the time then present" (Heb. 9:1, 9).

      The sanctuary was a teaching device. Everything about it was to pre-
    figure or foreshadow some aspect of Christ's mediatorial ministry. It was
    made according to precise specifications.
       The book of Hebrews contrasts the two sanctuaries—one built by Mo-
    ses, the other pitched by the Lord Himself. The one was an earthly struc-
    ture, the other a heavenly one. The first, or earthly sanctuary, had "ordi-
    nances of divine service" (Heb. 9:1). From studying the book of
    Hebrews we learn that the heavenly sanctuary had prescribed services
    and ordinances also. The first tabernacle (used interchangeably with the
    word sanctuary) was a temporary structure; its services were "for the
    time then present" (verse 9). The true sanctuary is in "heaven itself'
    (verse 24).

     SEARCH AND LEARN: Read Hebrews 9:1 through 10:22 and determine
     for yourself what happened to the services of the earthly sanctuary.



        There are two extremes that we must avoid in studying the sanctuary
     types. On one hand, we must be careful not to speak negatively of the
     earthly tabernacle and its services. Some have been guilty of this in an
     effort to highlight the efficacy of the heavenly sanctuary. Paul says the
     earthly sanctuary and its ordinances were glorious. Remember, God in-
     stituted it as a teaching device. Jesus is the originator of the type as well
     as the antitype. On the other hand, we must not become obsessed with
     the details of the earthly to the exclusion of the heavenly. The sanctuary
     was designed to throw light on what goes on in heaven; it was not to be an
     end in itself.

       What was the supreme purpose of the earthly sanctuary? Ex. 25:8.


       God always is the seeker, the initiator. He takes the first steps. Before
     we are aware of what He is doing, God devises plans that enable Him to
     reach out to us. He did this in the sanctuary. He provided a way of getting
     closer to His people without destroying them. Divinity, veiled and cov-
     ered, reached out to humanity.

     FURTHER STUDY: Exodus 25 through 27.

                                                                   Monday

                                            Lessons From the Sanctuary

Part 2 — God's Holiness
       "You shall hang up the veil from the clasps. Then you shall bring the ark
    of the testimony in there, behind the veil. The veil shall be a divider for you
    between the holy place and the Most Holy" (Ex. 26:33, NKJV).

      Everything about the tabernacle was holy, from the outer court to the
    most holy place. The linen curtain that surrounded the tent or tabernacle
    suggested the holiness of the structure.

      Why were the priests commanded to take off their shoes before perform-
    ing their duties? Ex. 30:19, 20.


       "The priests were not to enter the sanctuary with shoes upon their feet.
    Particles of dust cleaving to them would desecrate the holy place. They
    were to leave their shoes in the court before entering the sanctuary, and
    also to wash both their hands and their feet before ministering in the tab-
    ernacle or at the altar of burnt offering. Thus was constantly taught the
    lesson that all defilement must be put away from those who would ap-
    proach into the presence of God."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 350.

      What was the significance of the inscription on the priest's mitre
    (headwear)? Ex. 28:36-38.


      The purpose of the instruction given in this text was to impress the
    people with the awesome holiness of God and with the need of a pure and
    holy mediator. The holy God could be approached only by someone who
    was appointed, qualified, certified, and purified through the blood of the
    Lamb. The description of the consecration of the priests is found in Exo-
    dus 29.

         Where and how was God's presence most visibly manifest? Lev. 16:2.


      The holy place of the tabernacle was not accessible, except to a few
    priests. The most holy was closed even to the priests. The high priest
    alone could enter there and that only once a year on the Day of Atone-
    ment. There the presence of God was manifested in the holy Shekinah.
    The most holy place was a representation of the throne room in heaven.
    (See Ex. 25:18-22.) The spiritually sensitive Israelite must have been
    forcibly impressed with the idea of inacessibility—the remoteness of
    God—and his unworthiness to approach Him physically. The need for
    someone to go in before God for him was apparent. Without such a medi-
    ator, who represented the Christ yet to come, there was no possibility of
    bridging the gap.

                                           Lessons From the Sanctuary

Part 3 — Sin and Guilt
      "In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood,
    and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness" (Heb. 9:22,
    NIV).

       Numerous sacrifices were offered in connection with the sanctuary
     services: for example, burnt offerings, sin offerings, trespass offerings,
     and peace offerings.
       Various kinds of animals were involved—lambs, rams, goats, bulls, pi-
     geons, and turtle doves. The Jewish historian Josephus observes that
     256,500 lambs were slain in a single Passover during Nero's reign. What
     an awful sight that must have been. The lesson behind the symbol is
     clear—sin is terrible and the price of redemption is enormous.

       Why were the sacrifices of the first tabernacle inadequate? Heb. 9:9.


       What humans need is not cleansing of the body but moral cleansing—
     soul cleansing from the defilement of sin. Sin's stain is deep and in-
     grained. No human detergent can wash it away. Here is where the Jewish
     sanctuary ritual fell short. It could not deal with sin at the place where it
     has taken root or set up headquarters—the mind. Something more than
     the blood of bulls and goats and purification rites was needed. Something
     more has been provided.

       What does the book of Hebrews indicate were the greater and "more
     perfect" things, and how have they been provided? Heb. 9:11-14.


       Many of the Old Testament prophets expressed the hope that a "better
     sacrifice" would be provided, one that would deal decisively and finally
     with the sin problem. They saw that the only way to be rid of guilt was to
     remove the sins that cause it. Indeed, almost every culture has some type
     of ritual cleansing. This seems to express a universal need. The Jewish
     sanctuary system did not purpose to be the final solution. Its validity was
     in the fact that it pointed vividly and effectively to something better.
     Through Christ we not only get rid of the guilt of sin but of sin itself.

     THINK IT THROUGH: What was the true value of the sanctuary and the
     sacrifices?

        "The whole worship of ancient Israel was a promise, in figures and
     symbols, of Christ; and it was not merely a promise, but an actual provi-
     sion, designed by God to aid millions of people by lifting their thoughts to
     Him who was to manifest Himself to our world."—Testimonies to Minis-
     ters, p. 123.

Part 4 — Sin Removed
       "It shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall
    confess that he bath sinned in that thing: and he shall bring his trespass
    offering unto the Lord for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the
    flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall
    make an atonement for him concerning his sin" (Lev. 5:5, 6).

      The earthly sanctuary portrays for us God's way of removing the stub-
    born stain of sin. The principle of substitution figured largely in the whole
    process. An innocent animal was slain as an offering for sin—the victim
    of another's transgression.

         What is significant about who actually slew the sacrifice? Lev. 4:33.


      The repentant sinner took the life of the substitute. By placing his
    hands on the head of the sacrifice the sinner symbolically placed his sins
    on the victim. The sin was then removed from the sinner to the sin bearer.

         What part did the priest perform in the ceremony? Lev. 4:34.


       When the congregation sinned the priest carried the blood into the holy
    place, putting some of it on the horns of the altar of incense and sprinkling
    some of it seven times before the veil. Most of the blood, however, was
    poured out at the base of the altar. (See Lev. 4:17, 18.)
       By repentance and confession our sins are placed on Jesus, the spot-
    less Lamb of God. He carries them, takes responsibility for them. "The
    priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them"
    (Lev. 4:20). Please note: The sin is removed, and then pardon is granted.
    Jesus saved us from our sins, not in our sins. The sinner was responsible
    for his part. He would confess, place his hands on the victim, and take its
    life. The priest was responsible for confessed sins but not for uncon-
    fessed sins. He took the blood into the sanctuary, or, in some cases, ate
    the flesh of the animal. He actually became, in type, the sin bearer.

       In what way did John the Baptist use sanctuary terminology in speaking
    of Jesus? John 1:29.


      The lamb symbol is used many times in the Bible (See Gen. 22:7; Isa.
    53:7; 1 Peter 1:19; Rev. 5:6; 12:11.) The development of the symbol
    reaches its height in the book of Revelation. There the Lamb is extolled
    as powerful victor, crushing the serpent's head and granting the re-
    deemed full reinstatement as inheritors of the kingdom. Their names are
    written in the Lamb's book of life. (See Rev. 13:8; 21:27.)

                                            Lessons From the Sanctuary

Part 5 — Morning and Evening Sacrifices
      "This is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two lambs of the first
    year day by day continually. The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning;
    and the other lamb thou shalt offer at even" (Ex. 29:38, 39).

       The ritual was carried out faithfully. The daily or continual service
    pointed to the constancy of Jesus our Mediator. His once-and-for-all sac-
    rifice is good for all time. Christians are "under the blood," in the safety
    zone. Provision has been made. Repentant sinners are covered by a "life
    assurance" policy.

       What practice of the pious Jews has influenced Christian devotional life?
     Ps. 55:17; 141:2.


        "The hours appointed for the morning and the evening sacrifice were
     regarded as sacred, and they came to be observed as the set time for wor-
     ship throughout the Jewish nation. And when in later times the Jews were
     scattered as captives in distant lands, they still at the appointed hour
     turned their faces toward Jerusalem and offered up their petitions to the
     God of Israel."—Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 353, 354.
        It must have been of great comfort to a scattered, oppressed people to
     know that a sacrifice was at all times on the altar in their behalf. It is good
     discipline that will pay off handsomely to gather the family at the begin-
     ning and end of the day for prayers. These seasons of prayer will follow
     the members of the family through the years. They have a binding, unit-
     ing influence on young and old.
        "The daily service consisted of the morning and evening burnt offer-
     ing. . . .
        "Every morning and evening a lamb of a year old was burned upon the
     altar, with its appropriate meat offering, thus symbolizing the daily con-
     secration of the nation to Jehovah, and their constant dependence upon
     the atoning blood of Christ."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 352.
        Those who recognize themselves as blood-bought and purchased also
     will acknowledge a debt of gratitude. The sure mercies of God demand
     the consecration of all their powers to Christ and His service. This will be
     done cheerfully and willingly. "We are to give ourselves to the service of
      God, and we should seek to make the offering as nearly perfect as possi-
      ble."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 352. This is the kind of offering that
      God calls a sweet savor with which He is well pleased.
         A picture you probably have seen shows an ox standing between a
      plow and an altar. The inscription near the bottom speaks to us with this
      challenge: "Ready for either." Our gift of ourselves to the Lord's service
      will be a perfect offering when it is characterized by this kind of commit-
      ment.

                                                                                 53

                                          Lessons From the Sanctuary

Part 6 — Focus and Application
      "What? know ye not that your body is the temple off the Holy Ghost
    which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? For ye are
    bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit,
    which are God's" (1 Cor. 6:19, 20).

       At a time when some are questioning why the sanctuary teaching is so
    important, we need to understand its full biblical significance. "Satan is
    striving continually to bring in fanciful suppositions in regard to the sanc-
    tuary, degrading the wonderful representations of God and the ministry
    of Christ for our salvation into something that suits the carnal mind. He
    removes its presiding power from the hearts of the believers, and supplies
    its place with fantastic theories invented to make void the truths of the
    atonement, and destroy our confidence in the doctrines which we have
    held sacred since the third angel's message was first given. Thus he
    would rob us of our faith in the very message that has made us a separate
    people, and has given character and power to our work."—Ellen G.
    White, Special Testimonies, Series B, no. 7, p. 17.

     APPLICATION: Study the following quotation carefully; then list some
     applications of this statement and this lesson to your life and actions.

      "Another lesson the tabernacle, through its service of sacrifice, was to
    teach—the lesson of pardon of sin, and power through the Saviour for
    obedience unto life.
      "Through Christ was to be fulfilled the purpose of which the tabernacle
    was a symbol—that glorious building, its walls of glistening gold reflecting
    in rainbow hues the curtains inwrought with cherubim, the fragrance of
    ever-burning incense pervading all, the priests robed in spotless white,
    and in the deep mystery of the inner place, above the mercy seat, be-
    tween the figures of the bowed, worshiping angels, the glory of the Holi-
    est. In all, God desired His people to read His purpose for the human
    soul. It was the same purpose long afterward set forth by the apostle
    Paul, speaking by the Holy Spirit:
      " 'Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of
    God dwelleth in you? If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God
    destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.' 1 Corinthi-
    ans 3:16, 17."—Education, p. 36.

 The S nctuary Services
MEMORY TEXT: "The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of
the God of Jacob defend thee; send thee help from the sanctuary, and
strengthen thee out of Zion; remember all thy offerings, and accept thy
burnt sacrifice; Selah. Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil
all thy counsel" (Ps. 20:1-4).

  The mediatorial ministry of Christ provides for all our real needs. That
ministry is now centered in the heavenly sanctuary. Needs are met and
blessings flow from that great center of redemptive ministry. In Ezekiel's
vision the healing waters issued out of the sanctuary (Eze. 47:12), seem-
ingly flowing from the altar. Because of our Saviour's mediation we are
sustained and are to see in all that comes to us the blessing of the Lamb.
"The bread we eat is the purchase of His broken body. The water we
drink is bought by His spilled blood. Never one, saint or sinner, eats his
daily food, but he is nourished by the body and the blood of Christ. The
cross of Calvary is stamped on every loaf. It is reflected in every water
spring."—The Desire ofAges, p. 660.
   The spiritual enlightenment that enables us to grasp the great essentials
of salvation is the gift of Christ's sacrificial love and His sanctuary minis-
try. Also the grace to resist temptation and overcome the enemy is medi-
ated or channeled through Jesus Christ our Lord. Were it not for His ear-
nest work on our behalf, we would never escape from sin's snare. This
was clear to the psalmist. He recognized that God's way was in the sanc-
tuary (Ps. 77:13). The psalmist was moved to put all his trust in the Re-
deemer. He saw adequate evidence of the Lord's concern for Israel. Is-
rael was under the watchcare of Messiah the Prince, and He who watched
over them would "neither slumber nor sleep" (Ps. 121:4).

Part 1 — The Bread of the Presence
      "Put the bread of the Presence on this table to be before me at all times"
    (Ex. 25:30, NIV).

       Christ's mediatorial ministry is not limited to the purely spiritual. Our
    temporal provisions also come through Jesus Christ our Lord. All bless-
    ings flow through the channel of mediation. Food, shelter, clothing, the
    joys of human friendship—all are mediated. The bread of the Presence or
    shewbread was viewed as an offering. Because it did not involve blood it
    did not symbolize forgiveness and reconciliation through the shed blood.
    "It may be inferred that when Israel offered by way of the priesthood the
    twelve loaves of bread before God, she was expressing in a pictorial man-
    ner not only thanksgiving for His bounties, but also a continuous petition
    for both physical and spiritual nourishment."—Frank B. Holbrook,
    "The Israelite Sanctuary," in The Sanctuary and the Atonement, ed. Ar-
    nold V. Wallenkampf and W. Richard Lesher (Washington, D.C.: Re-
    view and Herald Publishing Association, 1981), p. 25.

       Why did Jesus include a petition for bread in the prayer He taught us to
     pray? Matt. 6:11.


       The Bible teaches that there is a difference between the sacred and the
     profane. However, it does not draw a sharp line between the spiritual and
     the material. Christ created the natural world for us. We need to beware
     of a "spirituality" that divorces itself from God's good world.

      What do Jesus' "bread of life" statements found in John 6:33, 35, 50, 51
     mean to us today?


       Jesus' hearers were confused because they took His words literally.
     They were even more shocked by His suggestion that they drink His
     blood. For Jesus to encourage the Jews to taste blood was sacrilege.
     What could He ever mean? they asked one another. Having been taught
     by the rabbis, they should have known that the Saviour was referring to
     His teaching, His words. (See John 6:63.)

       How did Jesus relate His words to His person? John 12:48.


       To reject the words of Jesus is to in effect reject Him as Saviour. We
     cannot divorce Christ from His words.

      What significance can be found in how often the bread of the Presence
     was renewed? Lev. 24:8.

Part 2 — The Light of the World
      "Thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light the lamps
    thereof, that they may give light over against it" (Ex. 25:37).

       Darkness symbolically represents ignorance. When a person says, "I
    was kept in the dark on the matter," he or she means, "I was prevented
    from obtaining the facts." But light dispels darkness.
       By the time of Jesus, there were two huge lampstands in the temple
    court. These lamps were kindled after the evening sacrifice and shed their
    light over the city. The people hoped for the Messiah to come and shed
    His light over Israel just as the lampstands illuminated Jerusalem.

      Summarize in your own words what Jesus means in introducing His ser-
     mon on light the way He did in John 8:12.


       "In the manifestation of God to His people, light had ever been a sym-
     bol of His presence. At the creative word in the beginning, light had
     shone out of darkness. Light had been enshrouded in the pillar of cloud
     by day and the pillar of fire by night, leading the vast armies of Israel.
     Light blazed with awful grandeur about the Lord on Mount Sinai. Light
     rested over the mercy seat in the tabernacle."—The Desire of Ages, p.
     464.

       How does this symbol of God's presence influence people on planet
     Earth? 2 Cor. 4:6.


        We need to keep in mind that every ray of light, understanding, and
     truth, which ever has pierced the gloom enshrouding the earth and human
     hearts, comes through Jesus Christ. He is Mediator of the saving knowl-
     edge of God. (See John 17:3.) He is the light "which lighteth every man
     that cometh into the world" (John 1:9). "Every gem of thought, every
     flash of intellect, is from the Light of the world."—The Desire of Ages,
     p. 465. He flashes the light into our intellects, and thus we are enabled to
     "see" truth.

Part 3 — The Altar of Incense
      "Thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim wood shalt
    thou make it."
      "And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony,
    before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee.
    And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he
    dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it" (Ex. 30:1, 6, 7).

      Many times, our prayers are tainted with traces of selfishness. Some-
    times we do not even understand our own motives. The ministry of the
    altar of incense illustrates how our prayers are made acceptable. The
    adding of the incense—the righteousness and merits of Christ—renders
    our prayers acceptable before God.

    der to better understand Christ's antitypical ministry at the altar of incense
    in the heavenly sanctuary. Indicate what you learn in the space provided
    below:




       The system works. A feeble human whispers a prayer on earth, and it is
     amplified in heaven—heard and answered by a prayer-hearing God
     whose ears always are open because of Christ's mediation.
       The Spirit's intercession is different from that of Christ. His is more a
     work of assistance than of mediation. There is no hearing impairment
     with God, or inability to understand our speech. The communication
     problem is with us. The Holy Spirit does His work on this end—
     prompting our prayers and helping us to frame our words and express
     the thoughts that He has implanted. The answer is bound up with the
     petition. He knows what to pray for; and when we cooperate with Him,
     He "maketh intercession . . . according to the will of God" (Rom. 8:27).

        What privilege is ours that would have been unthinkable for a petitioner
     to do literally on the grounds of the earthly sanctuary? Heb. 10:19, 21, 22.


        Jesus opens the way into the heavenly sanctuary through His sacrifice,
     His shed blood. There is unimpeded access to the presence of God. He
     also prepares us for this privilege by making our hearts clean through the
     sprinkled blood.
        "Our Redeemer has opened the way so that the most sinful, the most
     needy, . . . may find access to the Father."—The Desire of Ages, p. 113.

Part 4 — Mercy and Justice
      "The cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the
    mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; to-
    ward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be. And thou shalt put
    the mercy seat above the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony
    that I shall give thee. And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune
    with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims
    which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee
    in commandment unto the children of Israel" (Ex. 25:20-22).

      The most holy place of the earthly sanctuary was a symbolic represen-
    tation of the throne room in heaven. Ellen White's description is unsur-
    passed: "No language can describe the glory of the scene presented
    within the sanctuary—the gold-plated walls reflecting the light from the
    golden candlestick, the brilliant hues of the richly embroidered curtains
    with their shining angels, the table, and the altar of incense, glittering
    with gold; beyond the second veil the sacred ark, with its mystic cheru-
    bim, and above it the holy Shekinah, the visible manifestation of Jeho-
    vah's presence; all but a dim reflection of the glories of the temple of God
    in heaven, the great center of the work for man's redemption."—Patri-
    archs and Prophets, p. 349.
       The mercy seat covered the ark. Enshrined in the bosom of the ark was
    the law of God, a transcript of His character. It is highly instructive that
    the ark's covering is called the mercy seat. God's throne is a mercy seat
    at which mercy is blended with justice.

        What words used by Paul and John illustrate the function of the quality
     of mercy in Jesus Christ? Rom. 3:25; 1 John 2:2.


       The atoning work of Christ covers or reconciles the sinner to God.
       "The ark was the hub of Israelite religion and worship. . . . It could be
     said that all the essential elements in redemption coalesce [come to-
     gether] at the ark: God Himself, His law, sacrificial blood, and priestly
     mediation."—Frank B. Holbrook, "The Israelite Sanctuary," in The
     Sanctuary and the Atonement, p. 28.
       The Bible indicates that the ultimate solution to the sin problem was
     related closely to Christ's work in the most holy place. It was here that
     the symbolic services of atonement and intercession were centered. They
     met in the holy of holies. So those great students of the Word had to
     conclude that the atonement provided on the cross must be consummated
     in the most holy place. God upholds the principles of His law as abso-
     lutely unchangeable (justice stands), but He places mercy in the form of a
     Mediator before Him as a covering for sin.

Part 5 — The Day of Atonement
      "He shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make
    an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar, and
    he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the
    congregation. And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an
    atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year. And he did
    as the Lord commanded Moses" (Lev. 16:33, 34).

      Once a year in the Jewish economy a special day focused the ceremo-
    nial activities on the removal of sin and the cleansing of the sanctuary—
    the Day of Atonement. Priestly ministry had its finest, most decisive
    hour. The ritual was elaborate and impressive. Anticipation ran high. All
    Israel was involved—absolutely absorbed—in the drama. This is what
    the Day of Atonement actually was—a national drama that involved all
    the people of God.

      How was the great controversy between Christ and Satan illustrated in
    the two goats used on the Day of Atonement? Lev. 16:7, 8.


      The goat that was sacrificed symbolizes our Lord's sacrificial death.
    The scapegoat was not slain, and thus was not involved in redemption
    through the blood. Its function was different.

         What did the priest do with the blood of the slain goat? Lev. 16:15.


      Most biblical scholars agree that the priest's handling of the blood—
    they call it blood manipulation—is most important. On the climactic day
    the blood was sprinkled on and before the mercy seat—its ultimate appli-
    cation. Everything about the Day of Atonement ritual suggests finality
    and completeness. In these services the mediatorial process was com-
    plete, the sin problem fully resolved.

         What was the fate of the live goat? Lev. 16:21, 22.


      The chief instigator of sin and rebellion must suffer the fate that natu-
    rally results from transgression. Satan bears the sin he has caused and
    receives the ultimate wages of sin—eternal death. In no wise does he
    atone for sin, although his expulsion makes the at-one-ment complete.
    Jesus our Mediator alone provides, through His blood, the price of our
    redemption. Jesus' death was a voluntary sacrifice for sin. Satan's death
    will come as the involuntary consequence of sin.

Part 6 — Focus and Application
      "Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the breastplate of
    judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in unto the holy place, for a memo-
    rial before the Lord continually" (Ex. 28:29).

       The breastplate must have been an especially impressive article of
    clothing in the priest's glittering attire. (See Ex. 28:15-28 for a descrip-
    tion.) This symbol emphasizes again the intimate relationship between
    priest and people. He bore their names on his heart. When he went before
    the Lord, the people were, in symbol, carried with him into God's pres-
    ence.

      On what other article of the priest's clothing were the children of Israel's
    names inscribed? Ex. 28:8-12.


        When we speak of accepting Christ as our personal Saviour we imply
     that He becomes our Friend, One who is acquainted with us intimately,
     One who never leaves us or forsakes us (Heb. 13:5).
        The mediatorial ministry of Jesus benefits the entire creation, including
     the unfallen worlds and the heavenly hosts. However, we must not lose
     sight of the fact that its benefits also are personal. We serve the kind of
     God who sees sparrows fall and takes notice of the details of our lives,
     counting even the hairs of our heads. We can be sure that our Mediator
     keeps us in mind individually.
        The ephod and the breastplate are tokens of remembrance, "stones of
     memorial" which the priest bears "upon his heart before the Lord con-
     tinually" (Ex. 28:30). In the same way, the resurrected Christ, in His glo-
     rified body, bears the marks of everlasting remembrance, the scars of the
     nailprints and the spear wound. (See John 20:25, 27.) He will bear these
     throughout eternity. All of sin's trace effects will be erased except these
     tokens that will remind us of Christ's sacrifice.

     APPLICATION: Do you see a relationship between what we have stud-
     ied this week and the public forms of worship today?
        Many Christians follow the practice of bowing the head for a prayer of
     thanks before eating a meal. When observed doing this in a public estab-
     lishment, they are sometimes asked about this custom and its meaning.
     How would you answer?

IVR1         Adult Lesson


Advocate
Versus Adversary
MEMORY TEXT: "Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through
faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that
are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time his
righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth
in Jesus" (Rom. 3:25, 26).

   The fact that we, in and of ourselves, are lost and unable to do anything
about it cannot be disputed. Our redemption and rescue from the prison
house of sin calls for superhuman effort, for supernatural power. But God
can save us only in a way that is consistent with His character. He cannot
set aside His law in order to declare sinners righteous because His law is
a transcript of His character. It also is the foundation of His throne be-
cause God is the moral Governor of the universe. Therefore He cannot
simply say, "It's all right; I will let sinners by this time." Doing so would
compromise His rule of justice and undermine His moral authority.
   "It is not possible for God to offer a general amnesty for five or ten or
twenty billion sinners merely by divine decree. . . .
   "God created the universe of a million worlds governed in righteous-
ness. He created His creatures to live in righteousness. He instructed
them that any departure from righteousness would be considered rebel-
lion against Him. The penalty would be separation and death."—Edward
Heppenstall, Salvation Unlimited (Washington, D.C.: Review and Her-
ald Publishing Association, 1974), p. 47.
   The Mediator, the Atoning One, takes upon Himself the task of secur-
ing the sinner's release. He stands to plead his cause. He becomes his
advocate or legal aid. He pays the full penalty through His blood; and, as
a mercy seat, He becomes a covering, shielding the repentant sinner. His
work for sinners is not unopposed. The adversary challenges Christ's
right to redeem us. Yet there can be no serious question as to the out-
come. The Advocate takes guilty sinners and makes them righteous.
They stand before the law of God as though they had not sinned.
   "The atonement of Christ is not a mere skillful way to have our sins
pardoned; it is a divine remedy for the cure of transgression and the resto-
ration of spiritual health. It is the heaven-ordained means by which the
righteousness of Christ may be not only upon us, but in our hearts and
characters."—Ellen G. White, Letter 406, 1906.

Part 1 — All Need Legal Aid
       "What the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God
    sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned
    sin in the flesh: that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who
    walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit" (Rom. 8:3, 4).

      The law of God is declared to be perfect, holy, just, and good. It also is
    called spiritual. Our weak, carnal nature is incapable of obedience to
    such a holy standard. But the gospel brings good news. God sent His Son
    in human flesh to live out the principles of His Father's law in a totally
    human environment. No longer can the weakness of human flesh be
    made an excuse. A righteousness to match the law has been provided.
    Humanity is no longer compelled to rely on its own pitiful resources and
    strength to live in harmony with the royal law. The principles of God's
    holy law have been written on our hearts and minds.

       What assurance do we have that Jesus has dealt adequately with the sin
     problem? Rom. 3:24, 25;1 John 2:2.


       Jesus entered the human situation on the same level as does every child
     of Adam; and then, through one mighty deed—His death on the cross—
     He broke sin's stranglehold forever. By virtue of His atoning sacrifice,
     He has the authority to represent us, to cancel our debt of sin, and to
     shield us from the demands of justice which sin incurs.

       What function does the law serve? Rom. 3:20; 7:7, 13.


        The law of God is like a spiritual microscope. What is not apparent to
     normal vision is magnified a thousand times. We are enabled to see the
     serious nature of sin. Remember that it was Jesus' purpose to "magnify
     the law, and make it honourable" (Isa. 42:21).
        "It is by beholding that we become changed. And as those sacred pre-
     cepts in which God has opened to men the perfection and holiness of His
     character are neglected, and the minds of the people are attracted to hu-
     man teachings and theories, what marvel that there has followed a de-
     cline of living piety in the church."—The Great Controversy, p. 478.

     THINK IT THROUGH: Because of my sins I am under the heavy penalty of
     the law. As I recognize the exceeding sinfulness of sin, what else can I do but
     cry out for help—for something, someone, out of and beyond myself to step
     in and help me?

Part 2 — Skillful Advocate
        "Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is
     risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh interces-
     sion for us" (Rom. 8:34).

        Under the law we are brought to condemnation. "All have sinned, and
     come short of the glory of God" (Rom. 3:23)—Jews, Gentiles, even
     teachers of the law. We need a skillful lawyer to plead for us. Again the
     gospel has good news for us. The court has appointed legal aid. It is
     Christ who becomes our Advocate and intercedes for us.

      What did Jesus have to do in order to qualify as our perfect Advocate?
     Heb. 2:17, 18.


        Jesus identified with us completely. At His baptism He established His
     ties with humanity, accepting the rite although He had never sinned.
     When Jesus asked the Baptist to administer the rite, John shrank from the
     task. Jesus ordered him to go ahead with His baptism. The Advocate
     must set the full example as well as experience the real-life situation of
     those He would represent.

      Summarize what Hebrews 7:25 has to say about the effectiveness of
     Christ's advocacy.


       "No sooner does the child of God approach the mercy seat than he
     becomes the client of the great Advocate. At his first utterance of peni-
     tence and appeal for pardon Christ espouses his case and makes it His
     own, presenting the supplication before the Father as His own re-
     quest."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 364.

       What assurance do we have that our cases are not hopeless? John 6:37,
     39.


       The skillful Advocate pleads so effectively that not one of His clients
     need be lost. As a lawyer He has never lost a case.

       How does Jesus as our Advocate cope with the fact that we are guilty?
     1 John 2:1-3; 1:7.


       He does not cover the facts. He urges us to confess. Then He assumes
     responsibility for our sins. But it is only confessed sins that He covers.
     Unconfessed, unforsaken sins are our responsibility.

Part 3 — Provides Access
     "Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our
    Lord Jesus Christ: by whom also we have access by faith into this grace
    wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God" (Rom. 5:1, 2).

      The barriers in the earthly sanctuary, such as the curtains at the en-
    trance to the holy and most holy, suggested physical inaccessibility.
    Solomon's temple also had barricades and walls that kept Gentiles,
    women, and handicapped persons out of certain areas in the temple com-
    plex. But no one can block the way to the throne of God. There is equal
    access through Jesus. When He clothes us with His righteousness and
    presents us to His Father we are accepted in the Beloved.

      What attitude should characterize Christ's earthly clients as they ap-
    proach the judgment throne? Why? Heb. 10:19-22.


      Christ pierces the dividing curtains and appears before the throne on
    our behalf. His skill as Advocate, His acceptance in heaven, His power
    and status are calculated to inspire confidence and boldness in the client.
    There is no need to cringe in fear; the Advocate has pierced the veil. In
    Him we find assurance, certainty, and warranty.
      The proper way to enter a building is through a door. Entrance to the
    kingdom of God is through Christ alone. There is no other way. There are
    many false doors—most of which involve a salvation-by-works ap-
    proach, but also can include trusting in one's own faith for salvation. (See
    The Sanctified Life, pp. 63, 64.) But these false doors do not provide ac-
    cess. Not only is the gospel good news, but it also is simple. The faith that
    lays hold on eternal life is not complicated and cumbersome. To accept
    Christ as personal Saviour is to accept His claims upon us and His right to
    direct us. It involves focusing everything on Him and His will. When we
    do so He grants us a new status.

       What sort of things are involved in the new status that we receive through
     Christ? Rom. 8:16, 17; 1 Cor. 3:21-23.


        As members of the family of God we have access to all that is God's.
     Children have privileges denied nonmembers of the family. But the privi-
     lege also involves responsibility. "We shall not want to meet these
     slighted opportunities and neglected privileges in the day of judgment.
     Our eternal interests for the future depend on the present diligent perfor-
     mance of duty in improving the talents God has given into our trust."—
     Counsels on Stewardship, p. 127.

                                          Advocate Versus Adversary

Part 4 — The Adversary
      "He shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the
    Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him" (Zech. 3:1).

       Satan is called the "accuser of the brethren." He opposes Christ's
    mediatorial ministry. Those who belong to Jesus, who have become His
    clients, are Satan's special targets. While God is not willing that any
    should perish, Satan is not willing that any should be saved.

      What is the import of the way our Advocate responds to our adversary?
    Zech. 3:2.


      Satan delights in pointing out the shortcomings of the people of God.
    He would like to challenge the Advocate regarding His right to save these
    faulty people. "Are they the ones to take my place?" he asks derisively.
    Jesus does not-engage in debate with Satan. He simply rebukes him. It is
    Jesus' right to save; He has purchased it with His own blood. By His
    death and endless life Jesus saves. He knows how to deliver.

      How did Jesus demonstrate His power over the adversary at the time of
    the death of Moses? Jude 9.


       Even before the cross, Christ was more than equal to the conflict. Sa-
    tan claimed Moses' body. Again, notice that Jesus did not enter into an
    argument with him. His standard response seemed to be: "The Lord re-
    buke thee." Satan merited rebuke because he had tempted humanity in
    the first place. He steals the affections of Christ's lawful possession, His
    children; leads them astray; and then seeks to become the arresting offi-
    cer, judge, and jury. But our Advocate will not relinquish His right to
    save those who cling to Him in faith. One obvious task of our Mediator is
    to place a check on Satan's power. While salvation is all of grace and is
    not dependent on human effort, determined effort is necessary to stay in
    saving relationship to Jesus Christ. The Christian cannot remain passive.
    Satan must be resisted. (See 1 Peter 5:8.)

      In the vision of Joshua and the angel, what symbolic act determined the
    outcome? Zech. 3:4, 5.


       The change of raiment mentioned indicates Christ's righteousness that
    is both imputed and imparted to us. "The righteousness by which we are
    justified is imputed; the righteousness by which we are sanctified is im-
    parted. The first is our title to heaven, the second is our fitness for
    heaven."—Messages to Young People, p. 35.

                                           Advocate Versus Adversary

Part 5 — Adversary Silenced
      "I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and
    strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the
    accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God
    day and night" (Rev. 12:10).

      "The last link of sympathy between Satan" and unfallen beings was
    broken when he murdered Christ. (See The Desire of Ages, p. 761.) For
    that reason he now is restricted to this planet. But at one time he had
    access to other worlds; he also badgered the good angels as they came
    and went from heaven. Such access was no longer granted him when
    Christ gained the victory on the cross.

        What biblical evidence indicates that Satan and his hosts are now con-
     fined to earth? Rev. 12:12, 13.


       The adversary has been forced to limit his influence to this fallen
     world. His wrath knows no bounds. He is furious over the restraint. His
     resulting anger is directed against the followers of Christ. If only he could
     exterminate them, his sovereignty over earth would be unresisted.

       What powerful weapons of resistance do Christians have? Rev. 12:11.


       "So long as the soul rests with unshaken confidence in the virtue and
     power of the atonement, it will stand firm as a rock to principle, and all
     the powers of Satan and his angels cannot sway it from its integrity."—
     Testimonies, vol. 4, pp. 357, 358.

     APPLICATION: How can I avail myself of this protection? What steps
     should I take to make sure the blood is on the "doorpost" of my heart?

       What completely and forever silences Satan's accusations that humans
     cannot obey God's law? Rev. 14:1-5.


        When the Mediator brings His people to perfection, Satan's accusa-
     tions are demonstrated to be wrong. "To those who call upon Him for
     strength for the development of Christian character, He [Christ] will give
     all needed help." "While Satan has been urging his accusations, holy
     angels, unseen, have been passing to and fro, placing upon the faithful
     ones the seal of the living God. These are they that stand upon Mount
     Zion with the Lamb, having the Father's name written in their fore-
     heads."—Prophets and Kings, pp. 590, 591.

                                          Advocate Versus Adversary

Part 6 — Focus and Application
      "The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the
    Son."
      "And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is
    the Son of man" (John 5:22, 27).

       Heaven is a friendly court. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, as well as all
    the heavenly host, are trying to pull us through. The investigative pre-
    advent judgment does not put us in a kind of double jeopardy, as if God
    were seeking to do everything possible to destroy us. In the investigative
    judgment God goes public. He opens books and discloses records that
    vindicate His justice and mercy. His salvation is so complete and ade-
    quate that there is nothing for those to fear who have demonstrated their
    acceptance of Christ's advocacy by allowing Him to live out His life
    within them. In fact, a pre-advent judgment is called for to demonstrate
    that God's dealings are beyond suspicion. He in no wise excuses the
    guilty. But His plan makes the guilty guiltless through His Son, the Medi-
    ator, who also is Judge.
       "Because He has tasted the very dregs of human affliction and tempta-
    tion, and understands the frailties and sins of men; because in our behalf
    He has victoriously withstood the temptations of Satan, and will deal
    justly and tenderly with the souls that His own blood has been poured out
    to save,—because of this, the Son of man is appointed to execute the
    judgment."—The Desire of Ages, p. 210.

      What assurance do we have that Christ's mediatorial ministry will be
    successful on our behalf? Jude 24, 25.




    APPLICATION: This week's lesson portrays how the great controversy
    comes to focus in each life.
      Zechariah 3 provides a vivid frame for this contest. All humans may
    identify with Joshua. This transfer may provide a useful self-evaluation
    exercise.
      1. List areas of your life where Satan may legitimately accuse you of
    shortcomings this week.
      2. At the bottom of this page write a commitment to Jesus. In this,
    surrender the list you made under 1 above and accept His forgiveness.
      3. Hear Christ rebuke Satan.
      4. Sense the feeling of cleansing as Christ enfolds you in His righteous-
    ness.

Our Priest-King
MEMORY TEXT: "Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express
image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power,
when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down upon the right hand of
the Majesty on high" (Heb. 1:3).

    Christ has set up a mediatorial kingdom. He has a throne. Even now
He exercises kingly rule. His kingdom is not earthly, nor is it yet the
future kingdom of glory. It is that kingdom of grace which stands between
the kingdoms of this world and the final revelation of the everlasting king-
dom that shall ultimately swallow up all others. He now is enthroned as a
Priest-King. He was installed in this position at His ascension. The
phrase "at the right hand of God" indicates supreme honor and author-
ity. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost signaled
Christ's inaugural. "The Captain of our salvation is interceding for His
people, not as a mere petitioner to move the Father to compassion, but as
a conqueror who claims the trophies of His victory."—Gospel Workers,
p. 154.
    Our Mediator acts from a position of strength. As He stated to His dis-
ciples, all power is given unto Him in heaven and earth (Matt. 28:18).
Jesus' work did not end at Calvary. As one writer puts it, "He did not
 retire to write His memoirs." He entered upon a vigorous ministry of
 mediation and reconciliation that will not cease until the plan of salvation
 is accomplished. The Son of man, seated at the right hand of the throne of
God, is exalted. God has bestowed upon Him the name which is above
 every other name (Phil. 2:9). All creatures are commanded to worship
 Him. (See Eph. 1:21.)
    From the throne of mediation Christ wages warfare against Satan and
 his evil angels. When Jesus came He invaded Satan's kingdom, overcame
 the powers of darkness, and set up on earth an extension of His kingdom.
 Those who accept Him as Saviour and Lord have been delivered from the
  power of darkness and translated "into the kingdom of his dear Son"
 (Col. 1:13). Thus they have become targets of the enemy who seeks to
 destroy them. There are battles and casualties. Not all soldiers are loyal,
  but our Priest-King is steadfast. He stands up on behalf of His people.
 They look to Him for direction, and from His sanctuary He leads them
  from victory to victory.




                                                                          69

                                                            Our Priest-King

Part 1 — Priest and King
       "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make
    thine enemies thy footstool."
       "Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek" (Ps. 110:1,
    4). (See also Heb. 7:1, 2.)

       Reference already has been made to the multiphased ministry of Jesus
    Christ. He is Prophet, Priest, and King. The book of Hebrews applies the
    prophecy of Psalm 110 to Jesus. He is compared to Melchizedek, who
    was called king of Salem, king of peace, and a priest of God. Many be-
    lieve that Melchizedek was an ordinary human being who by character
    and office could be a type of Christ in His dual role of priest and king.

     What can we learn about Christ's ministry from the historical account of
    Melchizedek? Gen. 14:18-20.


       "At one time Melchisedek represented the Lord Jesus Christ in per-
    son, to reveal the truth of heaven, and perpetuate the law of God."—
    Ellen G. White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 1093.
       As an authority figure Melchizedek had impressive credentials. He
    blessed Abraham (father of the faithful and friend of God) and he received
    tithes from him. "Now consider how great this man was, unto whom
    even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils. . . . And with-
    out all contradiction the less is blessed of the better" (Heb. 7:4-7). To
    place any earthly figure above Abraham was a high tribute indeed.
       "It was Christ that spoke through Melchisedek, the priest of the most
    high God. Melchisedek was not Christ, but he was the voice of God in the
    world, the representative of the Father."—Ellen G. White Comments,
    S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 1, p. 1093.

      What contribution does the prophet Zechariah make in regard to the
    dual role of Christ as Priest-King? Zech. 6:13.



      As Melchizedek was king of peace, so Christ is called the "Prince of
    Peace" (Isa. 9:6). Christ shares the throne of the universe with the rest of
    the Godhead.

         What other aspect of Christ's thone is brought out in Hebrews 4:16?


      The kingdom over which Christ now rules is the kingdom of grace. It is
    that invisible, spiritual kingdom which Jesus referred to as being "within
    you" (Luke 17:21). In this kingdom the King also is our Priest.

Part 2 — The King's Subjects
       "Giving thanks unto the Father . . . who hath delivered us from the
     power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear
     Son" (Cot. 1:12, 13).

       Christ, our Priest-King, takes former rebels and transforms them into
     loyal subjects. He delivers them from the terrible slavery of sin. Then He
     registers them as members of His new kingdom. It is possible to us by
     choice to change our citizenship through the provisions He has made.

       What characteristic particularly marks the subject of the King? Heb.
     5:9.


        Obedience is the hallmark of the saints, the highest expression of loy-
     alty. Disobedience and disloyalty gave rise to the sin problem. The lyrics
     of the old spiritual are theologically correct: "My God will raise up a na-
     tion that will obey." The covenant relationship is based on the law of
     God. "If ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye
     shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people . . . : and ye shall be
     unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation" (Ex. 19:5, 6). Under
     the terms of the everlasting covenant the law is inscribed on the hearts of
     Christ's followers, both in Old Testament and New Testament times.

       What privileges and rights go along with citizenship in Christ's kingdom?
     1 Peter 2:9, 10.


        The King's subjects are to reflect His character to the world. They are
     to be light bearers among the nations. The love relationship between the
     King and His subjects places great demands on both. Christ has fully dis-
     charged His responsibility to His children. The question is, "Are we ful-
     filling the terms of the agreement (covenant), discharging our responsibil-
     ity?"

       How do citizens of the kingdom live in relation to the world? Phil. 2:15.


       Christians must offer the world a choice, something different, some-
     thing better. The church of God is a colony established in this world by
     Heaven. Everything about this colony should suggest the "home coun-
     try." Its members should demonstrate a different attitude as well as a
     different philosophy of life and life-style. The Priest-King is working in
     and through human beings toward the formation of a thoroughly trans-
     formed community. They are to form a body of light that will illuminate
     the earth.
                                                                                   71

Part 3 — The King's Ransom
      "From Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of
    the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us,
    and washed us from our sins in his own blood" (Rev. 1:5).

      The word translated as "witness" is the same as our word martyr. Our
    Priest-King was willing to pay the supreme price in order to ransom us.
    When the Scriptures speak of a person's blood being shed, they almost
    always refer to violent death. This is the strong inference in Isaiah
    53:12—"He hath poured out his soul unto death." The struggle for our
    salvation cost the King His life. His resistance to sin literally pressed
    blood from His pores.

      What comparison does Peter make between Christ's ransom price and
    earthly ransoms? 1 Peter 1:18, 19.


      "The plan of redemption involved the death of the Son of God. Unless
    we conceive of God as being entirely unlike us, this cost must have been
    immense. 'I might give myself,' one father said upon hearing the story of
    the cross, 'but I could never give my son.'
      "The cost to the Son of God was equal to that of the Father. He must
    become incarnate, be subject to His own creatures and from them suffer
    every indignity, and at last be hanged on the tree as a criminal."—M. L.
    Andreasen, The Book of Hebrews (Washington, D.C.: Review and Her-
    ald Publishing Association, 1948), p. 257.

         What is the significance of the word redemption in Ephesians 1:7?


      The Bible uses several picture words in speaking of salvation in Jesus
    Christ. In this case it is redemption. The term comes from the slave mar-
    ket where human beings were bought and sold, or from the business
    world. To redeem means "to buy back," "to repurchase." People bor-
    row from a moneylender, ordinarily leaving some valuable item as collat-
    eral. Redemption of the article involves a price.
      "The world does not acknowledge that, at an infinite cost, Christ has
    purchased the human race. They do not acknowledge that by creation
    and by redemption He holds a just claim to every human being. But as
    Redeemer of the fallen race, He has been given the deed of possession,
    which entitles Him to claim them as His property."—Ellen G. White,
    Letter 136, 1902.
      Our ransom is a sure and solid one.

Part 4 — The King's Gifts
        "Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity cap-
     tive, and gave gifts unto men" (Eph. 4:8).

       Ancient kings celebrated their victories by lavishing gifts upon their
     subjects. On Christ's ascension He inaugurated a kingdom and reign that
     particularly is characterized by generosity. He is anxious to give good
     gifts. He is the heavenly Merchantman who comes laden with good things
     and lavishes them on His people. But basic to our reception of all His
     gifts is our willingness to repent.

       What gift must precede the forgiveness of sin? Acts 5:31.


        Repentance is first and foremost a gift. It cannot be generated by hu-
     man effort. It is the King's goodness that produces this radical change in
     the sinner. Sorrow for sin is a part of the experience, but more is in-
     volved. There must be a turning away from sin. When repentance takes
     place sin is viewed in a different light. The New Testament Greek word
     for repentance refers literally to "a change of mind." In commenting on
     David's repentance as recorded in Psalm 51, Ellen White says, "A repen-
     tance such as this, is beyond the reach of our own power to accomplish; it
     is obtained only from Christ, who ascended up on high and has given gifts
     unto men."—Steps to Christ, p. 25.
        Notice the consequences of trying to repent under our own power:
        "Just here is a point on which many err, and hence they fail of receiv-
     ing the help that Christ desires to give them. They think that they cannot
     come to Christ unless they first repent, and that repentance prepares
     them for the forgiveness of their sins. It is true that repentance does not
     precede the forgiveness of sins; for it is only the broken and contrite heart
     that will feel the need of a Saviour. But must the sinner wait till he has
     repented before he can come to Jesus? Is repentance to be made an obsta-
     cle between the sinner and the Saviour?
        "The Bible does not teach that the sinner must repent before he can
     heed the invitation of Christ. . . . It is the virtue that goes forth from
     Christ, that leads to genuine repentance. . . . We can no more repent
     without the Spirit of Christ to awaken the conscience than we can be par-
     doned without Christ."—Steps to Christ, p. 26.

      Why does Christ emphasize our need of repentance in the Laodicean
     message? Rev. 3:19.

Part 5 — The Gift That Brings All Others
        "Being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Fa-
     ther the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this, which ye now
     see and hear."
       "Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in
     the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the
     gift of the Holy Ghost" (Acts 2:33, 38).

      It bears repeating that the risen Lord lavishes gifts upon His people.
    The outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost signaled that
    His priestly reign had begun. The Holy Spirit is the gift which "when
    claimed by faith, brings all other blessings in its train" (The Desire of
    Ages, p. 672)—a major gift indeed.

       What do we know about Christ's willingness to grant this major gift?
     Luke 11:13.


       One of Jesus' favorite themes was the gift of the Holy Spirit. As His
     earthly ministry drew to its close, He expanded on the subject even more.
       "In Jesus' farewell discourses to His disciples He told them: 'Never-
     theless I tell you the truth: It is to your advantage that I go away, for if I
     do not go away, the Counselor will not come to you; but if I go, I will send
     him to you' (Jn 16:7). Why would it be to their advantage to have Jesus
     leave and the Holy Spirit come to take His place? Because since Jesus
     had taken on human nature He was subject to the limitations of time and
     space. . . . But the Spirit is not so limited. Hence, Jesus had to go away
     and return through the Spirit in order to be forever present."—Walter F.
     Specht, "Christ's Session, Enthronement, and Mediatorial and Interces-
     sory Ministry," in The Sanctuary and the Atonement, p. 351.

       What part does the Holy Spirit play in the proclamation of the gospel?
     (See Acts 1:8.)


       It is impossible to witness effectively for Christ without the Holy
     Spirit. The disciples were commanded to wait for the gift. They did not
     venture forth to challenge the nations with the claims of Christ until they
     were endowed with Christ's all-conquering Spirit. What happened as a
     result is recorded in the book of Acts.

    THINK IT THROUGH: If the exalted Christ is so anxious to give the Holy
    Spirit to His followers, why do we not see results similar to those that were
    seen in the apostles' day?

Part 6 — Focus and Application
      "I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall
    any man pluck them out of my hand" (John 10:28).

       Actually, Jesus shares His life with us. No earthly potentate or power
     can grant life. Angels cannot give life. But Christ has life within Himself.
     He is the Source of life. Basically Christianity consists of Christ's sharing
     His life with His followers, thus creating on earth a fellowship of believ-
     ers—a community energized by the life He gives. The quality of this life is
     that of the Source.

       Colossians 1:13 speaks about Christians being "translated . . . into the
     kingdom of his dear Son." How does this transformation take place? John
     3:3-7.


        The born-again Christian has a new life source—a new beginning, a
     new genealogy. When we were sinners we were rebels. We were outside
     the commonwealth, the community. The Priest-King works a miracle.
     Through the agency of the Holy Spirit He makes rebels over again. We
     break with the past and cut the old ties, the alliances that bound us to the
     enemy's service. Conversion is the forging of a new alliance, a new rela-
     tionship, a new status. The mediatorial ministry of Christ makes this as-
     tounding change possible—indeed, effects it.

       What other terms illustrate the conversion or born-again experience?
     Titus 3:4-6.


       Conversion, new birth, regeneration, and renewing are used inter-
     changeably. Shades of meaning may be involved, but the idea of radical,
     but positive, change is inherent. From His throne our Priest-King medi-
     ates His own life, a life equal to the life of God, to the community of His
     followers. The phrase "through Jesus Christ our Saviour" ordinarily re-
     fers specifically to the work of the Mediator, to His dynamic ministry.
     Our High Priest has "obtained eternal redemption for us" (Heb. 9:12).

     APPLICATION: Melchizedek means "King of Peace." Has He brought
     peace into your life?
        Are you concerned about a relationship or program in your church con-
     gregation in which there are tensions?
        Select one area where a lack of harmony is recognized. Outline a pro-
     cedure that you believe would meet Christ's plan for resolving the con-
     flict. How can you, as one member, introduce and promote this resolu-
     tion in accordance with Christ's method of working?

REAPING Adult Lesson


       ediator and Judge
MEMORY TEXT: "The judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his
dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end. And the kingdom and
dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall
be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an
everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him" (Dan.
7:26, 27).

   The biblical concept of judgment centers around a throne, or, we might
say, two thrones—one authentic, the other a rival throne of pretension.
"The Lord hath prepared his thone in the heavens; and his kingdom
ruleth over all" (Ps. 103:19). "A glorious high throne from the beginning
is the place of our sanctuary" (Jer. 17:12). The Bible also speaks of a
"throne of iniquity" (Ps. 94:20) and graphically describes the enemy's
intention to establish it. (See Isa. 14:13, 14.)
   Thrones are authority symbols, and closely connected with authority is
dominion. One of the key words in Daniel's prophecy is dominion, which
comes from the Hebrew word for the "right to rule." Who shall sit upon
the throne of universal dominion? A usurper, a crafty and cunning pre-
tender, has made charges against that throne. He initiated them in the
very precincts of glory, among those that stood by—the angels. But the
One seated upon the throne has chosen His time to bring the matter into
court—to settle the issue. Sufficient evidence now has been accumulated
to prove that the pretender prince is a liar, a cheat, and a scoundrel; the
root cause of every difficulty that has plagued the human family.
   As Daniel in vision saw sin running riot, apparently unchecked for cen-
tury after century; as he viewed the rise and fall of the empires; as he saw
the saints suffer persecution and even death; as he saw truth crushed to
the ground and the priestly ministry of our great High Priest obscured by
counterfeit, earthly priestcraft; he wondered, "How long?" His
unspoken question was voiced by one of the holy ones and was answered
with the time prophecy of Daniel 8:13, 14.
   The biblical concept of judgment has three dimensions: (1) Satan must
be condemned decisively, (2) God's name and character must be vindi-
cated, and (3) the saints also must be cleared (pass the loyalty test) and be
accepted as citizens of the kingdom. Since 1844 this work of judgment has
 been in progress. In 1844 the focus of Christ's ministry moved beyond the
 veil into the holy of holies. As the literal translation of Daniel 7:22 assures
 us, Christ there will pronounce judgment in favor of the saints.

                                                     Mediator and Judge

Part 1 — A Day Appointed
      "He hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righ-
    teousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given as-
    surance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead" (Acts
    17:31.)

      The idea of a day of universal judgment is accepted by most Christians.
    Paul's statement indicates that God has specified a certain time when it is
    to take place. Jewish/Christian thought envisions an end to time. There
    will be a conclusion to human history. Jesus is God's agent to bring earth
    back into oneness with the creation. The entire process is in His hands.
    History is His story. He is the hinge of history and time. His role as
    Saviour and Mediator is pivotal. He is commissioned to restore, to bring
    back, to adjust, to make things right, and to judge.

      What assurance does Jesus give us in John 10:17, 18, and how does this
    assurance fit into the judgment picture?


      The resurrection of Jesus gives each of us the assurance that He is ade-
    quately equipped to take care of the dilemma caused by sin. Only the God
    who can raise the dead can deal with the past and its terrible record of
    injustices and inequities. He must be Master of time and the spheres—
    past, present, and future. Jesus' resurrection proves that He can connect
    the ages. His judgment is more than a review; it is a settlement of every
    issue. Death cannot prevent or preempt Christ's work of judgment. He
    will carry the matter forward to a final, irreversible conclusion. And this
    will be done in righteousness, with the strictest integrity.

      Summarize what the apostles were commanded to preach with respect to
    this work of judgment. Acts 10:42.


       Apostolic proclamation is basic. Our preaching and teaching is firmly
     rooted here; it derives from the original testimony and witness of the men
     who lived and worked with Christ.

     SEARCH AND LEARN: Study the second chapter of Romans in order to
     understand better why Paul includes the judgment of the secrets of men in
     what he terms "my gospel."

       Rather than divorcing judgment and gospel, Paul's gospel embraces ev-
     ery aspect of Christ's mediatorial ministry. It is all part of the good news,
     whether we consider forgiveness of sin or the final annihilation of sin.



                                                                               77

Part 2 — A Question About the Appointed Day
      "Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that cer-
    tain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily
    sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and
    the host to be trodden under foot?" (Dan. 8:13).

       This heavenly conversation concerns the length of time for "the sanc-
    tuary and the host to be trodden under foot." "How long shall be the
    vision?" The vision is the prophetic overview of an important segment of
    the great controversy. Its background is found in chapter 7, where the
    rise and fall of empires, the vivid judgment scene, and the career and
    activity of the mysterious "little horn" were shown Daniel. Chapter 8
    brings the vision into sharp focus.

       Notice the activities and developments of the little horn that are foretold
    in Daniel 8:9-12.
      The little horn (1) waxed exceeding great; (2) expanded its empire to-
    ward the south, the east, and toward the pleasant land; (3) cast some of
    the hosts and stars to the ground and stamped on them; (4) magnified
    himself to the prince of the host; (5) took away the daily sacrifice; (6) cast
    down the place of God's sanctuary; and (7) cast down the truth to the
    ground.

      How do many Protestant interpreters understand the beast-symbols of
    Daniel 8?
      Many agree that (1) the ram is the Medo-Persian Empire, (2) the he-
    goat is Greece, (3) the four horns are the divisions of the Grecian Empire,
    and (4) the little horn which waxed great is both pagan and papal Rome.

      What activity of the little horn power caused Daniel the greatest concern?
    Dan. 8:11.


       The prince of the host is Jesus Christ. (See Dan. 9:25; 10:13, 21; 12:1.)
    The activities of the little horn range far beyond the desecration of the
    earthly sanctuary. In its pagan phase, Rome destroyed the Jewish tem-
    ple. In its papal phase, Rome introduced a substitute priesthood and ser-
    vices that made the ministry of Christ ineffective. The taking away of the
    daily sacrifice, in this case, is the intrusion of an earthly mediatorial min-
    istry between God and man. As Daniel saw the truth about Christ and His
    mediatorial work crushed and "cast to the ground," he was astonished.
    To add to his alarm, this persecuting power continued to prosper.
       The question of Daniel 8:13 must have been in his heart: "How long
    shall be the vision?" Will the destroying power hold sway forever? When
    will relief come? When will the sanctuary be restored to its rightful place?

                                                      Mediator and Judge

Part 3 — The Answer
      "He said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall
    the sanctuary be cleansed" (Dan. 8:14).

      After what seems to be an eternity of waiting on the part of angels and
    the inhabitants of other worlds, God, in His appointed time, set the pro-
    cess in motion that would settle the sin problem. The opposing power has
    done its worst; truth, including the mediatorial ministry of Christ, has
    been obscured. God's response is positive and specific within a predeter-
    mined time frame. Here is one of those times and seasons that the Father
    has within His power. "Then shall the sanctuary be cleansed." Even the
    truth about Christ's mediatorial ministry is to be restored. God's ways
    and His sanctuary are to be vindicated and justified. The sanctuary and
    the 2300-day vision point to the fact that Christ our Mediator has entered
    the final phase of His work. The vision (Dan. 8:1-14) brings us down to
    the year 1844. The countdown has been activated. There can be no turn-
    ing back of the prophetic clock. "The hour of his judgment is come"
    (Rev. 14:7).

      How was the vision explained to Daniel? Dan. 8:15, 16.


      Read Daniel 8:17-27. Daniel apparently understood all the symbols in
    the vision. But he seemed to be having difficulty understanding why so
    much time would be involved before the sanctuary could be cleansed or
    restored. Evidently he thought that this might mean a delay in the time
    when the Jews were to return to their own land and rebuild the sanctuary
    in Jerusalem. God did not answer right away, but the vision of Daniel 9
    was intended to help Daniel understand what he was having difficulty in
    grasping.

       How was this difficulty cleared up in the vision of Daniel 9? (Note in par-
    ticular verses 22, 23.)


      Daniel had pondered the matter for a long time. As the result of his
    prayer recorded in Daniel 9, additional understanding was given him.
      It is not our purpose in these lessons to deal in detail with the 2300
    days. Suffice it to state that the time span began in 457 B.C. and ended in
    A.D. 1844. Seventy weeks, or 490 years, were set aside for the Jewish
    nation, during which the items outlined in verse 24 would be fulfilled. The
    remainder of the time indicates the period until Christ's final judgment
    ministry begins.

Part 4 — In His Court
       "I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit,
    whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure
    wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A
    fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands
    ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before
    him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened" (Dan. 7:9, 10).

       In 1844 the temple in heaven became a courtroom. Thrones were set in
    place. "This judgment throne was set at a very special time. The thrones
    had not always been placed; the court did not always sit. . . . The term
    throne is the Hebrew word korse. It means a throne of a very special
    type, reserved for special occasions. . . . Since this court scene takes
    place in the heavenly sanctuary, we must look for the beginning of a new
    phase of the sanctuary ministration that involves a work ofjudgment."—
    Edward Heppenstall, Our High Priest, pp. 111, 112.

         What makes the work of the heavenly sanctuary so vital?


      "The sanctuary in heaven is the very center of Christ's work in behalf
    of men. It concerns every soul living upon the earth. It opens to view the
    plan of redemption, bringing us down to the very close of time and reveal-
    ing the triumphant issue of the contest between righteousness and sin."
    —The Great Controversy, p. 488.

         What is the nature of the judgment? Dan. 7:22-26.


       The judgment is concerned with the saints. It also has to do with the
     beast power that opposes God and His people. The message of the judg-
     ment is that relief is on its way. Decisions are made in the courtroom
     setting. Awards are given and punishments are meted out. The thing to
     remember is that judgment is rendered in favor of and on behalf of the
     saints. They are vindicated and rewarded. They benefit from Christ's
     mediatorial ministry. God's saving righteousness wins the day in court.
       "The judge is addressed as the helper or redeemer of the party that
     considers itself wronged. The mere fact that a case is taken up by a court
     in session (in the gate, in the royal palace or in the sanctuary) can be
     called justification or righting the wrong. . . . The juridical event in-
     cludes the recognition and acceptance of the judgment by the affected
     parties and by everyone else who hears of the judgment."—Markus
     Barth, Justification (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing
     Company, 1972), pp. 19, 20.
       We can be sure that God's court will not make a mistake. There will be
     no mistrial. Every verdict will be seen and acknowledged as just and true.

Part 5 — Our Representative
      "I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came
    with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they
    brought him near before him" (Dan. 7:13).

      Daniel was shown myriads of angels, a fiery throne, and the Ancient of
    days taking His seat. The court was called in session. The books were
    opened, meaning full disclosure. Now comes the climactic moment. The
    Son of man, who has been in the presence of the Father, assumes a new
    role. He comes now as the Representative of humanity before the throne
    of judgment. He stands there as our Substitute and Surety, in our stead.
    He is there to obtain acquittal and also the kingdom for those He repre-
    sents.

       Note how this reinforces the fact that it was essential to the plan of salva-
    tion that Jesus must become a human being.
       "Jesus became a man that He might mediate between man and God.
    He clothed His divinity with humanity, He associated with the human
    race, that with His long human arm He might encircle humanity, and with
    His divine arm grasp the throne of Divinity."—Ellen G. White, Letter
    121, 1897.
       "By His appointment He [the Father] has placed at His altar an Advo-
    cate clothed with our nature. . . . Christ intercedes in behalf of those
    who have received Him."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 363.
       Jesus appears in court on our behalf. In the same way that the ancient
    priest bore the names of Israel on the breastplate and the ephod, the Son
    of man carries us up to the very throne of God. He is the Representative
    of humanity in general, but especially represents those who trust in Him.
       The intercession of Christ is made more effectual by His close identity
    with us. It is as though He represented His people in a class-action suit.
    The members of the class are considered one and the same. The fate of
    the class and the Representative who takes the case to court is the same.
    If Jesus is exonerated, we are. This is why Ellen White says, "We are not
    to be anxious about what Christ and God think of us, but about what God
    thinks of Christ, our Substitute."—The Faith I Live By, p. 113.

       How does the book of Hebrews describe this ministry of Christ? Heb.
     9:24.


        There are two phases to Christ's ministry in the heavenly sanctuary.
     Daniel 7 describes what took place as the second phase began. In the
     ancient sanctuary there were two apartments in the tabernacle. In the
     first apartment the daily or continual ministry took place. The Day of
     Atonement services took place in the most holy. Jesus did not abandon
     His first-apartment ministry when He began the second-apartment work.

Part 6 — Focus and Application
      "There was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all peo-
    ple, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlast-
    ing dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall
    not be destroyed" (Dan. 7:14).

      The idea of the kingdom of God is prominent in Daniel. Closely con-
    nected with the concept of kingdom is dominion, the right to rule or sov-
    ereignty. "This judgment determines who has the right to rule, the right
    to exercise sovereignty over all nations, tongues, and peoples. Christ
    comes to the Father to receive this dominion."—Edward Heppenstall,
    Our High Priest, p. 123.

          With whom does Christ share this kingdom? Dan. 7:27.


      It is Christ's highest delight to share His kingdom with His followers.
    "He [Christ] asks for His people not only pardon and justification, full
    and complete, but a share in His glory and a seat upon His throne."—The
    Great Controversy, p. 484.

       What picture are we given of Christ standing up for His people during the
    last great crisis? Dan. 12:1.


       Michael is Christ. (Compare Jude 9; Rev. 12:7.) It is the name that de-
     scribes best His role as a mighty conqueror who wins back the long-lost
     kingdom. Dan. 12:1 states literally that Michael mounts guard over His
     people. As Mediator, He must protect and secure those whom His blood
     has redeemed. Deliverance is promised the people of God.

       What major attempt does Satan make to destroy the people of God and
     thus thwart Christ's purposes? Rev. 12:12, 17.


        Satan unleashes one final, furious attack on the saints. He is well aware
     that the mediatorial ministry of Christ is near successful conclusion. He
     is determined to prevent it. But the mediatorial kingdom cannot be
     shaken.

     APPLICATION: The promises of the Bible speak of the kingdom's being
     kept for us, held in reserve. While there is a time of trouble before us, we
     are not to be preoccupied with it. We are to place ourselves in the hands
     of the One who holds the kingdom in trust. Christians should not concen-
     trate on the power of the enemy. They should magnify the power of their
     Mediator-King.

REAR    Adult Lesson

When Mediation Ceases
MEMORY TEXT: "The temple was filled with smoke from the glory of
God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till
the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled" (Rev. 15:8).

   Mediation can be thought of as Christ shielding sinners. The question
then might be raised, "Shielding them from what?" The biblical answer
is "the wrath of God.". What, then, is God's wrath? Does God get angry
as we do and lose His temper? Does He sometimes act out of fits of rage?
   In the first place, God is not a man. We must be careful not to transfer
human characteristics to the Godhead. God's wrath, someone has said, is
the temperature of His love. It is His irreconcilable attitude toward evil.
We can know that this attitude toward sin is predictable and constant. "I
am the Lord, I change not" (Mal. 3:6). His wrath is not something that is
temporary and stirred up only when humans commit evil acts. His anger
is against sin. He alone sees in all dimensions the terrible evil that trans-
gression has brought on the human family. So God is set to exterminate
the "plague." He cannot compromise here. But mercy pleads that the
sentence be deferred in order that the sinner may have opportunity to
accept Christ.
   When the plan of salvation was explained to the heavenly host, all vol-
 unteered to join in the rescue mission. Think of the vast enterprise—the
 redemption of the lost planet and all its doomed inhabitants! From age to
 age the plan unfolds. Human history documents the mission. Prophecy
 gives a hint as to its duration. There are limits. The mission does not go
 on ad infinitum. From time to time the curtain is pulled back just enough
 to reveal what would happen if the shield between humanity and God's
 wrath were removed. A glimpse of God's wrath was given at the time of
 the Flood and in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. A little glimpse
 also can be seen in the lives of certain evil characters such as Korah,
 Dathan, and Abiram. These glimpses are sufficient to impress us with the
 way it will be when mediation ceases.
    The smoke-filled temple which no one can enter indicates the end of
 Christ's pleading—no more intercession, no warding off the conse-
 quences of disobedience. Every human being must stand before his
 Maker without the intercessory ministry of Christ or the convicting min-
 istry of the Holy Spirit. Does this mean that Jesus no longer serves as our
  Protector? No! Michael stands up for His children during the great time
 of trouble and provides them a double guard of angels. (See Early

Part 1 — Saving Gospel—Warning Message
      "I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting
    gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and
    kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and
    give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him
    that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters"
    (Rev. 14:6, 7).

      The heavenly sanctuary is the divine communication center from
    which messages of salvation are beamed toward earth. Mediation is not
    complete until it has touched human lives. The purpose of Christ's
    mediatorial work is to extend the kingdom of God by establishing a com-
    munity of loyal subjects on earth—a community in which His name is
    honored and through whom His will is done.

      Notice that two aspects of Christ's saving message stand out in Revelation
    14:6, 7.

       1. There is a strong element of warning. The announcement "Fear
    God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come" is a
    sobering fact. Most of God's major messages to earth are characterized
    by this warning aspect. Think of the messages of Noah, Elijah, Jonah and
    John the Baptist.
       2. Next comes the good news of redemption and safety. The warning
    is given to point out the danger. However, coupled with the warning is
    the invitation to salvation. Both must be made plain. Notice that the first
    angel proclaims the everlasting or eternal gospel. The announcement was
    first made in Eden (Gen. 3:15), and its final sounding is given in the end
    time. As the end nears the signal becomes clearer and more intense.

    SEARCH AND LEARN: Study all of Revelation 14 and pick out the indica-
    tions you can find stated or implied of the worldwide spread of the three
    angels' messages. Determine for yourself why such widespread proclama-
    tion is necessary.




      No other generation has the urgency that is laid on this one. Earth's
    population must be informed about the dangers, about counterfeit wor-
    ship, about the inadequacy of salvation by human effort without Christ,
    and about the religious lawlessness that will characterize the last days.

Part 2 — Grace Not Unlimited
      "The Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he
    also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years" (Gen. 6:3).

      The people before the Flood were given a time limit. The effectiveness
    of the Holy Spirit's wooings and pleadings is determined by human re-
    sponse. It is left with us to say Yes or No. But there comes a time when
    pleadings unheeded are not repeated.

      How does the work of the Holy Spirit relate to the sealing? Eph. 4:30.


      Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are joined together in the great effort to
    save humanity. The fact that Jesus became a man ensures representation
    for us in heaven. The Father gave His Son, and the Holy Spirit makes
    effective what Father and Son have done. Part of His office work is to
    testify of righteousness and judgment and to point us to the sanctuary
    where the work of salvation continues. The Spirit, through His work of
    leading us to repentance and the new birth, starts the new Christian on
    the path that leads to ultimate salvation. The Spirit, by His power, keeps
    us on that path.
      The Holy Spirit conveys Christ's life to us. While the Holy Spirit and
    Jesus Christ may be distinguished as Persons, Their ministry to the hu-
    man soul is indistinguishable. "Christ in you" is the "hope of glory"
    (Col. 1:27), and He (the Holy Spirit) shall be in you. He will abide in you.
    Thus, the ministry of the Holy Spirit absolutely is indispensable. The
    cross and Christ's ministry in the sanctuary must be worked out in human
    experience. The Holy Spirit does this.

       What indication does Jesus give that grace is not unlimited? Matt. 12:31,
     32.


        Without the aid of the Holy Spirit it is impossible for a person to re-
     pent, to experience the new birth, to resist sin, to understand the Word of
     God, or to witness effectively; and we could go on. Christ sends the Holy
     Spirit to bring conviction and draw us to Him. If we reject the Holy Spir-
     it's work, Christ's mediation for us is in vain.
        "With unerring accuracy the Infinite One still keeps an account with all
     nations. While His mercy is tendered, with calls to repentance, this ac-
     count will remain open; but when the figures reach a certain amount
     which God has fixed, the ministry of His wrath commences. The account
     is closed. Divine patience ceases. There is no more pleading of mercy in
     their behalf."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 208.

Part 3 — An Open and Shut Door
      "To the angel of the church of Philadelphia write; These things saith he
    that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth,
    and no man shutteth, and shutteth, and no man openeth" (Rev. 3:7).

       Through Jesus' mediation the door is kept ajar, probation is extended,
    and humans are given another chance. As long as He stands before the
    Father clothed in His priestly vestments, Jesus is the door of access. We
    cannot come to the Father except by Him and through Him. Noah's day
    is the classic example. The huge door to the ark could be opened and shut
    only by divine hands. However, we must not conclude that Jesus is more
    anxious for our salvation than is the Father or the Holy Spirit. Remem-
    ber, the Father provided the sacrifice; He placed the Son before His
    throne as Advocate, and He declared Jesus a Priest forever. The Father
    knew what was needed and provided just that. In some mysterious way
    all Heaven appeals for and to humanity through Christ. (See 2 Cor. 5:20.)

       What does Christ's heart cry as He realized that His earthly ministry was
    closing reveal about His concern for us? Matt. 23:37, 38.


      Christ kept the door of mercy ajar for Israel as long as He possibly
    could. The nation was given extension after extension of time. Now their
    probation was running out. He pleaded with them in the streets and in the
    temple. His voice called His generation to repentance. Then the fateful
    day came, and with it came the cry from a heart breaking with love.

       In what way do the parable of the fig tree and Christ's act in cursing the
    fig tree apply to the church and individual Christians? Luke 13:6-9; Matt.
    21:19, 20.


       "The parable of the fig tree, spoken before Christ's visit to Jerusalem,
    had a direct connection with the lesson He taught in cursing the fruitless
    tree. For the barren tree of the parable the gardener pleaded, Let it alone
    this year, until I shall dig about it and dress it; and if it bear fruit, well; but
    if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down. Increased care was to be
    given the unfruitful tree. It was to have every advantage. But if it re-
    mained fruitless, nothing could save it from destruction. In the parable
    the result of the gardener's work was not foretold. It depended upon that
    people to whom Christ's words were spoken. They were represented by
    the fruitless tree, and it rested with them to decide their own destiny.
    Every advantage that Heaven could bestow was given them, but they did
    not profit by their increased blessings. By Christ's act in cursing the bar-
    ren fig tree, the result was shown. They had determined their own de-
    struction."—The Desire of Ages, p. 584.

Part 4 — The Final Refusal
       "The third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man
     worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in
     his hand, the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is
     poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be
     tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in
     the presence of the Lamb: and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for
     ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast
     and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name" (Rev. 14:9-
     11).
       The third angel's message is the most solemn of all. It is proclaimed
     with a loud voice. It concerns worship. The issues are made clear in this
     final warning. What draws the wrath of God is the persistent refusal of
     His gracious offer of salvation and the deliberate choice of the counter-
     feit. Make no mistake about it, God will not brand anyone for eternal
     condemnation until He has given ample opportunity to understand the
     issues and the consequences. Those who finally reject the third angel's
     message actually refuse for all time the invitation to citizenship in the
     kingdom of the Mediator.

       What significance do you see in the attitude that characterized the citi-
     zens in the parable of the nobleman? Luke 19:14.


       Obedience and submission to Christ's authority are involved. In fact, it
     has always been the question of whom we really serve. What is our ulti-
     mate allegiance? To whom do we give supreme loyalty? This principle is
     expressed with crystal clarity in Paul's words: "Know ye not, that to
     whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom
     ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?"
     (Rom. 6:16). Christ's mediation and sacrifice avail nothing for the delib-
     erately disobedient.

       What is the ultimate condition of those who refuse light persistently?
     2 Cor. 4:3, 4.


       Every gift that is ours comes via the Mediator. The knowledge of God
     and spiritual illumination are mediated through Jesus Christ. Only
     through the light that shines in Christ can we grasp the saving knowledge
     of God. When this light is refused, darkness and eternal loss result.

        What final pronouncement settles all issues? Rev. 22:11.


                                                                               87

Part 5 — The Sealing
      "I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living
    God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given
    to hurt the earth and the sea, saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea,
    nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads"
    (Rev. 7:1-3).

       The final moments of Christ's mediatorial ministry are filled with busy
    activity. Angels of God are seen ascending and descending, carrying mes-
    sages of hope and salvation, supporting the faithful, and encouraging and
    strengthening the beleaguered saints. The social and political atmosphere
    that surrounds individuals, families, and nations becomes more and more
    threatening. The ripening of sin's harvest brings out all that is cruelest in
    humanity. As more and more people are given over to Satan's control,
    the restraining influence of the Holy Spirit is lessened. Not that the power
    of God is in any way diminished, but constant rejection has decreased the
    ability of many to respond to the Spirit's pleading. It is Noah's day, ante-
    diluvian society revisited.

         Notice two things that the seal of God denotes. 2 Tim. 2:19.


      1. "The Lord knoweth them that are his." The seal denotes owner-
    ship. In the ancient world when merchants purchased timber, they placed
    their seal or mark on their purchase. It was their brand, their sign of own-
    ership. Those who finally are sealed by God are His property indeed.
      2. "Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniq-
    uity." The seal also denotes purity. Because they have yielded them-
    selves with undivided allegiance, the blood of mediation is constantly ap-
    plied for their cleansing. (See 1 John 1:7.)

      What part does obedience play in the process of sanctification? 1 Peter
    1:22; John 17:17.


      Obedience is the hallmark of loyalty. God's requirements have not
    changed since Eden. Under the terms of the new covenant the law is writ-
    ten on the heart, engraved in the mind. And Jesus is the Mediator of this
    new covenant.

       What part does the Sabbath play in the sealing? Ex. 31:13; Eze. 20:
     12, 20.


      The Sabbath becomes the great outward sign of faith to all who follow
    the Lamb in obedience.

Part 6 — Focus and Application
      "He that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth
    was reaped."
      "And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire;
    and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in
    thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her
    grapes are fully ripe" (Rev. 14:16, 18).

      The principle of the harvest is taught clearly in Scripture. There is sow-
    ing and there is reaping. There is the development of the seed from germi-
    nation to maturity—sickle time. From the parable of the sower we learn
    that there are two harvests ripening. (See Matt. 13:24-30.) The one is a
    harvest of the good seed and the other the harvest of the evil. The enemy
    sows tares. However, in the parable it was not apparent which plants
    were tares until "the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit."

       What major lesson can you draw from Jesus' explanation of the parables
     found in Matthew 13:1-43?


       It is by inserting the principles of His kingdom like leaven in the hearts
    of human beings that Jesus propagates His kingdom. In like manner, Sa-
    tan introduces the principles of His kingdom, hoping to steal away sub-
    jects for himself. The history of planet Earth is the story of the develop-
    ment of these two opposing principles.

       Who alone is qualified to separate the wheat from the tares? Matt. 13:30,
     41, 42.


       Notice that the time comes when there will be a separation. This is
     determined by order of the heavenly tribunal. No earthly court has juris-
     diction here. The time comes when God pronounces a final judgment on
     every human being, living and dead. This takes place before Christ takes
     His seat upon the throne of His glory. (See Matt. 25:31; 13:39.)

     APPLICATION: It is human to procrastinate. We need the impetus of
     schedules and deadlines to assign priorities. These provide incentives to
     finish the task. The close of probation is a deadline in a very real sense.
     To help us avoid presumption, the final date has not been announced.
        The assignment this week is a serious one. It is to reaffirm priorities. In
     what areas of your life have you resisted Christ's mediatorial ministry?
        1. List three that you feel are significant.
        2. Outline a plan by which you will allow Christ's mediation to accom-
     plish its service for you.

MEMORY TEXT: "Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up
the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule
and all authority and power. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies
under his feet" (1 Cor. 15:24, 25).

   Jeremiah spoke of a time when the earth "was without form, and void;
and the heavens . . . had no light. . . . The mountains . . . trembled,
and all the hills moved lightly. . . . The birds . . . fled. . . . All the cities
thereof were broken down. . . . The whole land shall be desolate; yet will
I not make a full end" (Jer. 4:23-27).
   The millennium is not the full end. Satan is "bound" to this desolate
globe to behold the end result of his rebellion. All the wicked, the reject-
ers of God's love, are slain; the righteous are in the New Jerusalem. But
there remains a major episode in the story. The nations, Gog and Magog,
all who have lived out their lives on planet Earth, will be brought to make
a united admission that God is fair and correct in the way He has dealt
with them. Both saved and unsaved will agree. "We must all appear be-
fore the judgment seat of Christ" (2 Cor. 5:10). "Every knee" must bow
and "every tongue" confess (Rom. 14:11). This is done in the most public
manner possible. "In that day of final punishment and reward, both
saints and sinners will recognize in him who was crucified the Judge of all
living."—Ellen G. White, Review and Herald, Nov. 22, 1898.
   The replay of the entire great controversy in vast panoramic view re-
veals to every human being how his or her life stands up under the scru-
tiny of God's law and in the light of God's gracious offer of salvation. The
lost would prefer death to viewing this scene. But they have fixed their
own destiny.—(See The Great Controversy, p. 543.)
   The wicked admit to God's justice—even Satan bows. All creatures
great and small give homage to Him that sitteth on the throne. The re-
deemed are ecstatic in their praise to the Lamb. Then comes the end. The
wicked are destroyed. Christ, the Champion of God, who was given the
task of bringing the planet back, presents a united creation to His Father.
Rebellion has been eliminated completely. There is no possibility of fu-
ture defections. The mission has been accomplished. However, we must
keep in mind that Christ's death and the resurrection are the final, unan-
swerable arguments that ensure total victory. Eternity will never exhaust
the challenge to finite minds to advance to a deeper understanding of this
infinite mystery.

Part 1 — The "Not Yet"
      "Unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, 0 God, is for ever and ever: a
    sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom" (Heb. 1:8).

      Some theologians use the phrase "between the already and the not
    yet." The "already" is what Christ has accomplished in salvation his-
    tory—His incarnation, sinless life, death on the cross, resurrection, as-
    cension, and priestly ministry. The "not yet" points to the future—to His
    second coming and the setting up of the kingdom of glory.
      The kingdom of grace is being firmly established now. Those who ac-
    cept Christ as Saviour are incorporated into that spiritual realm. Citizen-
    ship in this kingdom prepares us for citizenship in the kingdom of glory
    that is yet to come.

      What distinguishes the purposes of the two advents? Heb. 9:28.


       The Mediator first had to deal with sin, to remove the accursed thing
    from His people. In the plan of salvation there is a sequence, a divine
    order. First comes the cross, then the crown. Jesus had to be the "man of
    sorrows" before He could become the "king of glory." We live out our
    days in anticipation of the "not yet," but in deep gratitude for the "al-
    ready." What Christ has done establishes our faith. There is ample evi-
    dence for belief. We trust now "that he who began a good work in you
    will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus" (Phil. 1:6,
    NIV). Christianity is a revealed religion based on historical events. Un-
    like many of the religions of the East, it is more than philosophy. Jesus
    was a great and wise Teacher. His sayings are basic and foundational.
    But Jesus is more than a Scholar-Teacher; He is a Redeemer. He is task
    oriented. He does something. He is active in human history.

      What attitude and what characteristics mark Christ's followers during
    this "not yet" period? Titus 2:13, 14.


      Our blessed hope focuses on the day when Christ will have accom-
    plished His mission. He fully intends to, and has demonstrated already
    that He is able to, rescue the lost planet and restore it to full harmony
    with the universe. This is the message of reconciliation, the message Sev-
    enth-day Adventists are commissioned to give to the world. It is based on
    the "already" (the great salvation events of history) and points forward
    with the assurance to the "not yet" (Christ's coming kingdom and reign).
    The message also tells those of us living "between the already and the not
    yet" how to look to the sanctuary for help and sustenance.

Part 2 — The Mediator Becomes a Mighty Warrior

    him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and
    make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many
    crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. And
    he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The
    Word of God" (Rev. 19:11-13).

       This passage is rich in symbolism. The rider under the first seal of Rev-
    elation 6 rides on a white horse. Clearly the idea conveyed by this symbol
    is that of triumph or accomplishment of purpose. The identity of the rider
    in Revelation 19 is certain. He is called "Faithful and True." He is also a
    righteous judge. Remember Jesus' words: "The Father judgeth no man,
    but hath committed all judgment unto the Son" (John 5:22). The Son is
    therefore God's agent or emissary. It is given to Him to wage war against
    the forces of evil and to bring the rebellious to judgment—in short, to
    settle accounts. The fact that He is crowned with many crowns indicates
    that universal dominion is now His. He is Lord of history (past, present,
    and future), of nations and kingdoms; all systems, social and political,
    come under His rule. There is nothing in all creation that is excluded from
    His realm.

         What details are added by the prophet Isaiah? Isa. 63:1-6.


       Edom is symbolic of the enemies of God's people who have harassed
    them through the centuries of time in one form or another. A victorious
    conqueror coming from Edom would mean relief for Israel. In this pas-
    sage also the identity of the conqueror is certain—"I that speak in righ-
    teousness, mighty to save" (Isa. 63:1). The striking similarity between
    the Isaiah and Revelation descriptions is continued with reference to the
    blood-stained garments or vesture of the conqueror. Redemption—to
    purchase back, to retrieve what was lost—requires strength. The Lamb is
    also the Lion. In fact, the wrath of the Lamb is a terror to the enemies of
    the Lord. The thought to keep in mind here is that mediation, as far as
    salvation history is concerned, is not complete until the rebellion is effec-
    tively put down.
       The Mediator accomplishes all of this alone. The disciples forsook Him
    and fled. On the cross darkness enshrouded Him, intensifying His loneli-
    ness. He accepted His baptism of blood and trial by fire that countless
    millions might gain everlasting life. The triumph becomes all the more
    rewarding for it. As He sees the travail of His soul, He is satisfied.

Part 3 — Law, Order, and Peace
      "The armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses,
    clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And out of his mouth goeth a sharp
    sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a
    rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of
    Almighty God. And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written,
    KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS" (Rev. 19:14-16).

      Adam forfeited his right to rule as God's vicegerent on earth when he
    sinned. Every earthly government has since failed to measure up to
    God's standard of righteousness and fairness. This is because human be-
    ings' best efforts and attempts are riddled with selfishness and pride.
    Lord Acton once said, "Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts ab-
    solutely." The best systems of government have checks and balances
    against unwanted power. However, the fact that so many prophetic sym-
    bols for nations are bloodthirsty beasts provides an indication that the
    ideal is not to be expected. Only the Son of man can be trusted with abso-
    lute, undiluted power. (See Eze. 21:25-27.)

      What distinguishes the rule of Christ from that of earthly powers? Isa.
    11:4, 5.


      The rule of Christ is the rule of righteousness and law. He will restore
    order in the natural and spiritual realms. The chaos brought about by sin
    will be overcome by His righteous rule. Peace will be established. Satan,
    the lawless one (2 Thess. 2:8), will be completely neutralized.

       What is the relationship between peace and law? Ps. 119:165; Isa. 48:18.


       The law of God must be restored to its rightful place if there is to be
     harmony and peace in creation. At the end of His sanctuary ministry,
     when the atonement is completed, the way is cleared for Christ to over-
     throw completely the system of lawlessness.

Part 4 — The Wedding
       "I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of
    many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for
    the Lord God omnipotent reigneth. Let us be glad and rejoice, and give
    honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath
    made herself ready. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in
    fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints"
    (Rev. 19:6-8).

       When the enemies of God are destroyed and his righteous rule estab-
    lished, there will be ample occasion for rejoicing. The marriage of the
    Lamb and the wedding reception signal the end of sin's long reign.
       Wedding customs of the ancient East were quite different from those in
    other parts of the world. There was the betrothal, in some ways a mar-
    riage contract, much more serious than engagements in Western custom.
    The wedding dowry was a part of the contract. The bride was expected to
    go through a time of personal preparation before the actual ceremony. It
    should be observed that a great deal of emphasis was placed on premar-
    ital preparatory activities. The marriage itself was not an elaborate cere-
    mony. It consisted of some public recognition which the bridegroom gave
    to the bride, such as throwing his coat over her as the procession moved
    toward the place of the feast. The supper was the big event. It lasted for
    days. The father of the groom usually took this occasion to confer some
    special gift on his son. The greater the dignity and authority of the father,
    the greater the gift expected of him.

      In what practical way do these ancient wedding customs apply to the
    work of redemption? Matt. 22:1-13.


      The king in the parable represents God the Father. His Son is Jesus
    Christ. When a king raised his son to a position of co-ruler, it was thought
    of as marrying him to his subjects. In the parable God indicates His pur-
    pose to unite all things in Christ. Notice there were three calls made to
    the marriage supper. The first of these appeals represents the preaching
    of the twelve disciples and the Seventy to the chosen people. The second
    call was extended after the crucifixion by the apostles who were told to
    begin at Jerusalem. After Stephen was stoned and the chosen people fi-
    nally rejected Christ's lordship, the third call was given to the Gentile
    world. It should be observed, however, that the guests were inspected or
    reviewed (the investigative judgment) before being admitted to the ban-
    quet hall.

         Why is the attire of those who attend the feast so important? Rev. 19:8.

Part 5 — The Register
      "The nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the
    kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it."
      "And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither
    whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are writ-
    ten in the Lamb's book of life" (Rev. 21:24, 27).

       The Bible speaks of the number of the saved, those who make up the
     register. The book of life, also referred to as the Lamb's book of life,
     contains the names of the saved of all ages. Christ's work of mediation
     brings the family of God together under one roof. They are the redeemed,
     or the bought ones, the ones for whom Christ prayed in His high-priestly
     prayer: "Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with
     me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given
     me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world" (John 17:24).

        How is the total vindication of the saints expressed in the book of Revela-
     tion? Rev. 22:14.


        Some versions render the text, "Blessed are those who wash their
     robes." (See RSV, NEB, NASB.) Whatever the version used, the result
     is the same—an abundant entrance into the kingdom of God. So complete
     is their salvation and vindication that they have a right to the tree of life.
     They are not slaves, but citizens of the New Jerusalem. The principles
     upon which Christ's kingdom is built have become the warp and the woof
     of their characters. Heaven is their element, as the ocean is natural habi-
     tat for fish, and birds are at home in the air. The Puritan preacher John
     Brown once said, "The problem is not so much to get us into heaven, as
     to get heaven into our hearts." From the sanctuary Christ actually im-
     parts His righteousness to the believer. His righteousness not only covers
     us but is written on the tables of our hearts. True believers become par-
     takers of the divine nature and are destined to develop characters that
     reproduce the character of Christ.

      How does the fate of those not "registered" compare with that of those
     who are? Rev. 20:11-15.


       The True and Faithful Witness makes this promise concerning the
     overcomer: "I will not blot out his name out of the book of life" (Rev.
     3:5). The converse also is true; those who turn back to a life of sin, who
     refuse to confess the Lord before their fellow human beings, are blotted
     out of the book of life. Unconfessed sin cancels the name out of the regis-
     ter. Both a person's sins and that person's name cannot remain on the
     books at the end. Either the sin will be blotted out or the name will.

                                                                                 95

Part 6 — Focus and Application
      "I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first
    earth were passed away; and there was no more sea" (Rev. 21:1).

       Throughout history the sea has been a symbol of separation. There are
    terrors in the sea, mysterious forces which humans do not understand.
    Even veteran sailors are awed by its waves and currents. In order to be
    complete, Christ's mediatorial work must include the conquest of every
    fear-inducing element. Death must be destroyed. Violence and destruc-
    tion must be eliminated. In the new earth there must be nothing to hurt or
    annoy. Everything that would vex and disturb must itself be destroyed.
    Sin and righteousness do not coexist throughout eternity. The Bible
    teaches the total annihilation of evil and the creation of a totally new
    world.

      How does the fact that no temple is seen in the New Jerusalem relate to
    Jesus' mediatorial ministry? Rev. 21:22, 23.


      The temple was thought of as a dwelling place, His residence. In the
    book of Revelation the temple is also the place where Christ carries for-
    ward His work of mediation. From the inception of sin there has had to be
    a Mediator. Someone has had to stand in the gap, to speak to God on
    behalf of humanity, and to communicate God's will to human beings. At
    the end of the millennium the Holy City comes down to earth. This calls
    for a reorientation of the universe, making earth the center of creation.
    The plan laid before the foundation of the world will then be fulfilled in
    every detail. Time will have been swallowed up in eternity. There will be
    no need for a Mediator: "The tabernacle of God is with men, and he will
    dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be
    with them, and be their God" (Rev. 21:3). His object from the beginning
    was to dwell with every intelligent being from highest seraph to lowliest
    human. This will be accomplished when the ultimate destruction of all sin
    and rebellion has taken place. Redeemed humanity will look on His face
    and be able to see His glory, unmediated. Communication between God
    and all His creatures once more will be open and direct. No distance,
    spatial or spiritual, will separate the Father and His children. The prophet
    Zephaniah saw it: "The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he
    will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will
    joy over thee with singing" (Zeph. 3:17).
      Never again will there need to be a Mediator. There will be no more
    curse, no more war, no rebellion!

    APPLICATION: What barrier in relationship, which, by the grace of
    Christ, will be removed in the new earth society, will be most significant
    to you? Why?
