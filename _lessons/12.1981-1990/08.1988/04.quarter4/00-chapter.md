Christ the Center of Truth




   These lessons conclude two quarters of study dealing with the twenty-
seven fundamental beliefs of the Seventh-day Adventist church.
   It is important to understand that every teaching of the church centers
in Jesus Christ. "Christ, His character and work, is the center and cir-
cumference of all truth, He is the chain upon which the jewels of doc-
trine are linked. In Him is found the complete system of truth."—Ellen
G. White, Review and Herald, August 15, 1893.
   As each doctrine is studied we need to ask ourselves how this doctrine
centers in Christ. Another question that should be addressed is, "How
does belief in this doctrine affect me today?" These two questions will
require meditation, prayer, and discussion if we are to receive a rich
reward from our study. Watch for the supplementary book at your local
Adventist Book Center.
          How To Study These Sabbath School Lessons
   Pray for the Holy Spirit's enlightenment. Jesus has not left us to
seek alone for an understanding of His Word by ourselves. He stated,
"When he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth"
(John 16:13). Time and mental effort are essential to understand the mean-
ing of the Bible. But only the Author Himself can impart to us the message
that He intends us to receive.

    Read through the entire lesson. At the beginning of the week read
through the lesson. Doing so provides an overview of the subject presented.
It is easier to grasp and remember part of any topic when you see it in rela-
tion to the whole. In this first rapid reading of the lesson, do not stop to
master every point. Look for the main thrust and the key points.

   Study one section of the lesson each day. Look up the Bible
verses, studying their wording in context until you are clear what they are
teaching. If you encounter problem words, phrases, or concepts, go to a
good Bible commentary or Bible dictionary for clarification. Remember that
factual information is interesting and important, but spiritual light and truth
are vital. Your study should not just inform; it should draw you closer to
Jesus.

   Compare your conclusions with Ellen White's explana-
tions. Her writings contain a wealth of interpretation designed to throw
light on the Biblical message. Because the Lord gave these messages, it is
exciting to discover the meanings that He attaches to His own Word. In
North America, a Spirit of Prophecy supplement entitled Sabbath School
Lesson Comments By Ellen G. White (Hartland Institute Publications) is
available from the Adventist Book Center. Check the Index to the Writings
of Ellen G. White for additional Spirit of Prophecy comments.

    Apply the message to your own life. Ask yourself, What is the
relevance of this Bible truth to my experience? Every Bible doctrine is in-
tended to be a Christ-centered means of uplift to the struggling believer.
Seek to understand how each doctrine relates to the affairs of your daily
life—your home life, your marriage or marital plans, your fellowship with
the church, your associations with people of the world, your work situation,
your goals in life, and your plans for eternity. Ask yourself what the particu-
lar subject has to do with your eternal salvation. Finally, talk to the Lord
about each subject as you are studying it. Ask Him to use your Bible study to
bring conviction, forgiveness, comfort, and spiritual power to your heart.
Ask Him to draw you into the closest possible union with Himself as you
allow Him to speak through His Word.
                                               Erwin R. Gane, Ph.D., Editor.

God Tells Us About
Baptism
 rkl 3   MEMORY TEXT: "Know ye not, that so many of us as were
 PM      baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? There-
         fore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as
         Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father,
         even so we also should walk in newness of life" (Romans 6:3, 4).

CENTRAL TEACHING: "Baptism. By baptism we confess our faith in
the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, and testify of our death to sin and
of our purpose to walk in newness of life. Thus we acknowledge Christ as
Lord and Saviour, become His people, and are received as members by His
church. Baptism is a symbol of our union with Christ, the forgiveness of our
sins, and our reception of the Holy Spirit. It is by immersion in water and is
contingent on an affirmation of faith in Jesus and evidence of repentance of
sin. It follows instruction in the Holy Scriptures and acceptance of their
teachings. "—Fundamental Belief No. 14.

INTRODUCTION: One well-known preacher used to say, "Sitting in a
church house no more makes you a Christian than sitting in a hen house
makes you a chicken." Neither does baptism make us Christians. Baptism
testifies that the Holy Spirit has taken up His abode with us. Through His
                                                                             7
    guidance and work we have acknowledged and repented of our sins and
    desire to live a new life in Jesus. Baptism has no meaning unless it is the
    public testimony of what the Holy Spirit already has done in us to enable us
    to become members of the family of God. But neither should we seek to
    become members of the church without baptism. Baptism attests to our
    union with Christ in the same way that the wedding service acknowledges
    publicly that a couple has decided to devote their lives to each other.
       Where did baptism originate? As a religious rite it "originated in pre-
    Christian times. It was practiced by the Jews as a means of receiving pros-
    elytes to Judaism. . . . The legal status of such a proselyte was that of a
    newborn child. . . .
       "It is significant that the Jewish leaders did not question John concerning
    the validity of the rite of baptism, but only his authority to administer it (see
    John 1:19-28). Baptism was also practiced by the Essenes in connection
    with their religious rites. In Khirbet Qumran, which was probably the center
    of the Essenes, several tanks with steps leading into them have been discov-
    ered. . . . These may have been used for baptismal rites, which apparently
    involved immersion, as did Jewish proselyte baptism."—SDA Bible Dic-
    tionary, pp. 118, 119.

SUN L WHAT BAPTISM IS.
MO
      What adaptation of the rite of baptism did John the Baptist make in
    order to help the people of his day identify with the work of cleansing
    necessary to prepare for the coming of Christ? Mark 1:4, 5.



       Although there were Old Testament antecedents that John the Baptist
    would have known about—ritual washings and cleansings, and the story of
    Naaman—he taught that the rite would involve spiritual cleansing. Thus it
    was to be more than a mere ritual or physical cleansing. He asked the people
    to demonstrate by their baptism that they recognized their sinfulness and
    were repentant. The step he asked them to take was a dramatic one. Those
    whom he baptized undoubtedly did not take the step lightly. John's call to
    baptism indicated that a drastic change was necessary to prepare people for
    Jesus' coming.

        1. A Confession of Faith.

        Why was Jesus baptized? Matt. 3:15.



       Acts 2:38 contains Peter's admonition to new converts to the Christian
    faith to be baptized as a symbol of the remission of sins. Having never
    sinned, Jesus did not need to be baptized as a symbol of confession for sins
    He had committed. By being baptized He identified Himself with the sinner
    who needs God's righteousness. He set an example for those who desire to
    be united with Him.

    8
      What do we learn about the Christian practice of baptism from the
    instruction that Jesus gave in Matthew 28:18-20 and Mark 16:15, 16.



      What evidence do we have that the early church understood and fol-
    lowed this instruction? Acts 10:47, 48; 22:12-16.



       2. A Testimony of Death to Sin and Newness of Life in Christ.
       Baptism attests not only to our death to sin but to our resurrection to a new
    life in Christ. (See Rom. 6:4, 5.)

      What relationship to sin characterizes the new life in Christ? Col.
    2:12; 3:1.



      3. A Prerequisite for Joining the Church.

      How did Jesus indicate that baptism is the sign of entrance to His
    spiritual kingdom? John 3:5.



    THINK IT THROUGH: Jesus indicated that we are to be baptized not
    only by water but also by the Spirit. What does this experience have to
    do with my becoming a member of the body of Christ? (See Acts 10:47,
    48; 1 Cor. 12:12-14.)

    ILLUMINATION: "Baptism is a most solemn renunciation of the world.
    Those who are baptized in the threefold name of the Father, the Son, and the
    Holy Spirit, at the very entrance of their Christian life declare publicly that
    they have forsaken the service of Satan and have become members of the
    royal family, children of the heavenly King."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 91.


n   11. WHAT BAPTISM DOES.

       Ancient baptistries attest to the vital importance of baptism to the early
    church. The significance is not in the rite itself, but in what it acknowledges
    to both the church and the world regarding our death to sin and new life in
    Christ.

      1. It Acknowledges Christ As Lord of Our Lives.
      Paul writes: "For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed
    yourselves with Christ" (Gal. 3:27, NASB).

      How is confession of faith in God and acceptance of Jesus as Lord of
    our lives tied into the rite of baptism? Rom. 10:9; Acts 16:30-34.
                                                                                   9
       Baptism by,immersion beautifully symbolizes a person's conversion ex-
    perience. Involved in that experience are sorrow for sin and turning away
    from it. The confessing sinner is forgiven and given new life in Christ. All
    these steps should precede baptism.
       In addition to bringing the Christian into a richer and closer relationship
    with God, baptism brings him into a new relationship with Christ's church
    on earth, a group of believers known for their love of God and one another.
    It is the door to church fellowship, as well as the door to discipleship.
      2. It Acknowledges That We Belong to the Body of Christ.
      Baptism publicly identifies us as Christians—members of the body of
    Christ. (See Acts 2:41, 47; Gal. 3:27-29.)

® 11.. WHAT BAPTISM SYMBOLIZES.
      The New Testament presents baptism within the context of Calvary, thus
    giving much more meaning and significance to this rite.

         1. Forgiveness of and Death to Sin.
      Complete the following analysis chart of Romans 6:3-10 in order to
    recognize the fullness of the symbolic aspect of baptism:

           Symbol of                 Jesus                         Us

         Crucifixion          Crucified for our          Old man (body of
                                 sins                                 ) crucified

         Death                Died for us                Buried with Him •by


         Resurrection         Raised from the            Raised in the
                                dead                       of His resurrection

         New Life             Lives unto God                            from sin;

                                                                        with Him

       Repentant sinners identify themselves with Jesus through the rite of bap-
    tism. By the sinless life He lived, and by His death on behalf of sinners,
    Jesus made His righteousness available to all. By taking part in this cere-
    mony that symbolizes death to sin, burial of the old life of sin, and resurrec-
    tion to new life in Jesus, believers demonstrate their acceptance of that right-
    eousness.

         2. Newness of Life in Christ.

      What kind of relationship with Jesus is implied in such expressions in
    Romans 6:3, 4 as "baptized into Jesus Christ" and "buried with him
    by baptism"?

    10
        "The postbaptismal life is to be a new-life, a different life, a life dead 10..
     sin and alive to God ([Romans 6:] verse 11, RSV). It is the life of one who
     has entered into a covenant relationship with,God, who shares covenant
     fellowship with like believers and, has pledged to adhere to the covenant
     stipulations. 'I will be their God, and they shall be my people' (Jer. 31:33,
     RSV). "—George Rice, Adventist Review, Dec. 11, 1986, p. 15.

       3. Reception of the Holy Spirit.

       What phenomena accompanied Jesus' baptism? How do these events
     relate to what happens when we are baptized! Matt.. 3:16, 17.


       We may not see the dove descending or hear the voice of God proclaiming
     "This is my beloved son [or daughter] in whom lam well pleased" when
     we are baptized, but in faith we know that God does for us what He did for
     Christ at the time He.was baptized.

      What do we learn from Titus 3:5-7 about the cleansing work of the
     Holy Spirit as it relates to baptism?




El   IV. WHAT BAPTISM INVOLVES.

        1. Immersion in Water.
        The Bible teaches baptism by immersion. In Romans and Colossians Paul
     compares the rite to Christ's death, burial, and resurrection. (See Rom. 6:1-
     6; Col. 2:12, 13.) This symbolism would have had no such significance if
     the apostolic church. had practiced a mode of baptism other than immersion.

     SEARCH AND LEARN: Study the passages that follow, indicating how
     the incidents described support baptism by immersion..


       • Matt. 3:16

        • John 3:23

        • Acts 8:38, 39

     ILLUMINATION: "That immersion was the mode employed in NT times
     is clear from the meaning of the Greek term, from Bible descriptions of the
     performance of the ceremony, and from the spiritual applications made in
     the Bible respecting the rite. The term baptizo was used anciently to de-
     scribe the immersing of cloth in dye, and of the submerging of a vessel in
     order to fill it with water. Its most obvious meaning when applied to Chris-
     tian baptism is "to immerse."—FDA Bibk Dictionary, p. 119.

        2. Essentials to Baptism.
                                                                                    11
     What is the spiritual significance of being baptized in the names of
   the members of the Trinity? Matt. 28:19, 20.



     What experience must precede baptism? Acts 2:37, 38. How does this
   exclude infant baptism?


      Infants are incapable of repentance, of being disciples, receiving the gift
   of the Holy Spirit, or obeying God's will. Only baptism of adults is men-
   tioned in the New Testament. There is not one mention of infant baptism.
      (See Acts 8:12, "both men and women"; Acts 8:13, Simon; Acts 8:29-
   39, the Ethiopian eunuch; Acts 9:17, 18, Saul; 1 Cor. 1:14, Crispus and
   Gaius.)

        3. The Question of Rebaptism.

        What one Bible precedent do we have for rebaptism? Acts 19:1-5.



   ILLUMINATION: "Those who have conscientiously taken their position
   upon the commandments of God, will, if rightly dealt with, accept all essential
   truth. But it needs wisdom to deal with human minds. Some will be longer in
   seeing and understanding some kindred truths than others, especially will this
   be the case in regard to the subject of rebaptisms, but there is a divine hand that
   is leading them—a divine spirit impressing their hearts, and they will know
   what they ought to do and do it."—Evangelism, pp. 373, 374.

TAU V. HOW WE PREPARE FOR BAPTISM.

      "When a person acknowledges his lost state as a sinner, sincerely repents
   of his sins, and experiences conversion, he may, when properly instructed,
   be accepted as a proper candidate for baptism and church membership."—

   to baptize them? Matt. 28:20.



     Every teaching that is based on the authority of Christ is to be taught. (See

      3. Relationship to Christ.

       Jesus made it clear that baptism is not an option nor is it to be taken
    lightly. Baptism indicates a dramatic change in the direction of a person's
    life. (See Acts 8:36-38.)
       Just as baptism by water in the days of John the Baptist prepared people
    for Jesus' coming, baptism by water and the Spirit helps prepare Jesus'
    loved ones for His second coming.
       When the armies of the Roman Empire invaded Britain they were com-
    manded to burn their ships behind them. A soldier asked the commander,
    "Sir, how will we retreat if we burn the ships?" The commander's reply
    was, "That's the whole point; there will be no retreat!"
       As we enter into water baptism we commit ourselves never to turn back to
    our old way of life. Now Jesus is supreme in our hearts. There will be no
    retreat. Joyfully and courageously we will advance to the gates of the eternal
    city of God.

      chapter 11, "The Baptism," pages 109-113.

    WHAT OTHERS TEACH: Arguments over the meaning of baptism and
    the age of the candidate go back to the early Christian church. Through the
    centuries many Christians have taught that infants must be baptized in order
    to be relieved of original guilt inherited from Adam. It is believed that if the
    unbaptized infant dies he is confined to "limbo," a halfway place in which
    he experiences neither the full joys of heaven nor the full terrors of hell.
    Others believe that by baptism the infant is incorporated into one "body" (1
    Cor. 12:13) and clothed with Christ (Gal. 3:27). Seventh-day Adventists
    reject the concept of original guilt and practice believer's baptism rather
    than infant baptism. We find ourselves in agreement with those churches
    that teach and practice immersion of believers.

    HOW TO SHARE THIS TRUTH WITH OTHERS: A basic principle in
    teaching any truth is to avoid criticism or ridicule of the beliefs and practices
    of others. This is especially true of the doctrine of baptism. Your approach
    to this subject will depend upon the experience of the one with whom you
    are sharing your faith. If the person has never been baptized, as an infant or
    otherwise, your primary task is to lead him or her to Christ preparatory to
    introducing the subject of baptism by immersion. If the person has been
    baptized, but not by immersion, your task is to show the beauty and meaning
    of Bible baptism. The supreme proof of both the necessity and method of
    baptism is the example of Jesus, who in love was baptized to fulfill all right-
    eousness and who endured an unparalleled baptism of suffering.

                                                                                  13
   SUMMARY: When by faith a person experiences the new birth he or she
is clothed with Christ's righteousness. The new believer then accepts bap-
tism by immersion as a demonstration of the union with Christ that has been
entered in10. He or she becomes part of His body, the church. Understand-
ing that baptism focuses on the death, burial and resurrection of Christ, by
the power of the Holy Spirit the believer dies to self and the world. He or she
makes a full surrender to Christ and His will.

CENTRAL TEACHING: "The Lord's Supper. The Lord's Supper is a
participation in the emblems of the body and blood of Jesus as an expression
of faith in Him, our Lord and Saviour. In this experience of communion
Christ is present to meet and strengthen His people. As we partake, we
joyfully proclaim the Lord's death until He comes again. Preparation for the
Supper includes self-examination, repentance, and confession. The Master
ordained the service of foot washing to signify renewed cleansing, to ex-
press a willingness to serve one another in Christlike humility, and to unite
our hearts in love. The communion service is open to all believing
Christians."—Fundamental Belief No. 15.

INTRODUCTION: How do Christian believers, separated from the time of
Christ by almost two thousand years, keep constantly in mind the signifi-
cance of Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension to heaven? How do we
enter into the spiritual experience enjoyed by Jesus' first disciples?
  The celebration of the Lord's Supper was designed by Christ as one
means by which those who believe might receive regular spiritual renewal.
In everyday life, one very effective way to get to know people is to eat with
them. In the Lord's Supper not only do Christians eat together but also we
commune with the Lord Jesus Christ. As we partake of the symbols of His
sacrifice, we receive by faith the spiritual nourishment that only Jesus can
supply.
   Our concern in this lesson is to discover from the Bible what Jesus intends
that the Lord's Supper should mean to every Christian believer. We also
need to know how He would have us prepare our hearts to take part in this
important service.

                                                                           15
® I. THE IMPORTANCE OF HUMBLE SERVICE.
     What problem kept recurring among Jesus' disciples? Mark 9:33,
   34; Matt. 20:20-24; Luke 22:24-27.


      There were only a few hours left before Jesus would be cruelly crucified.
   Yet pride ruled in the upper room. The disciples were vying with one an-
   other for the highest place in the kingdom. They had not learned the lesson
   of unselfish service. When group photographs are taken some stand to one
   side while wishing for a center position in the front row. So with the twelve;
   questions of status and personal importance were supreme. They wanted to
   be served instead of being servants. Try to imagine the feelings of Jesus in
   this situation.

     How did Jesus emphasize the importance of humility? Matt. 18:1-4;
   20:25-28; 23:8-12.


      Before honor is humility. Love for reward, position, or distinction has no
   place in Christ's kingdom. Rank, wealth, beauty, or intellectual greatness
   can never substitute for union with the humble Christ. There are no "Miss
   Universe" contests in heaven. Only those with changed hearts can under-
   stand these principles—"Except ye be converted" (Matt. 18:3). In God's
   sight, the greatest person in the church is the one who renders the most
   humble service.

   ILLUMINATION: "Had Christ come in the majesty of a king, with the
   pomp which attends the great men of earth, many would have accepted
   Him. But Jesus of Nazareth did not dazzle the senses with a display of out-
   ward glory and make this the foundation of their reverence. He came as a
   humble man to be the Teacher and Exemplar as well as the Redeemer of the
   race. Had He encouraged pomp, had He come followed by a retinue of great
   men of earth, how could He have taught humility?"—Testimonies, vol. 5,
   p. 253.

   11. THE ORDINANCE OF HUMILITY.

      The night before Jesus' death the disciples were arguing about who was
   the greatest. Jesus could not lead them into a deeply spiritual service while
   sin was in their hearts. He did something very special to teach them humil-
   ity, and He urged them to copy Him in the future.

      What demonstration of love and humility did Jesus give His disciples
   at the last supper? John 13:4, 5.



     While contention for the highest place Waged in the upper room, Jesus
   knelt down and washed twenty-four dirty feet. He stooped to serve. What an
   16
insight into His journey from His Father's throne, "not to be served but to
serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many" (Matt. 20:28, RSV). The
great descent of Christ from God to man is given in Philippians 2:5-8. The
ultimate humility is revealed in the words "He humbled himself by living a
life of utter obedience, to the point of death, and the death He died was the
death of a common criminal" (verse 8, Phillips).
   Think of the emotions that must have surged through Judas' mind as Jesus
washed his feet. For thirty pieces of silver Judas was about to hand Jesus
over to the Jewish authorities. Nevertheless, the Messiah, who knew what
Judas had done, instead of exposing him, stooped to wash his feet. The
power of Christ's love brought powerful conviction for Judas to confess his
sin. Tragically he rejected it. In his estimation, no one who would adopt the
position of an unimportant servant was worthy of his adoration. He deter-
mined to go through with his plan to betray Jesus and thereby lost eternal
life.
   Peter's reaction was different. He was overwhelmed by His Lord's bend-
ing so low as to wash his feet. He was ashamed that he was not doing what
Jesus was doing. He sensed that his personal pride had kept him from being
a servant. (See The Desire of Ages, pp. 645, 646.)

  Of what is the washing of feet a symbol? John 13:8-10; 15:3; Titus
3:5-7.


   "Christ is . . . speaking of the higher cleansing as illustrated by the lower.
He who came from the bath was clean, but the sandaled feet soon became
dusty, and again needed to be washed. So Peter and his brethren had been
washed in the great fountain opened for sin and uncleanness. Christ ac-
knowledged them as His. But temptation had led them into evil, and they
still needed His cleansing grace. When Jesus girded Himself with a towel to
wash the dust from their feet, he desired by that very act to wash the alien-
ation, jealousy, and pride from their hearts. This was of far more conse-
quence than the washing of their dusty feet. With the spirit they then had,
not one of them was prepared for communion with Christ. Until brought into
a state of humility and love, they were not prepared to partake of the paschal
supper, or to share in the memorial service which Christ was about to insti-
tute. Their hearts must be cleansed. "—The Desire of Ages, p. 646.

  What did Jesus urge His followers to do for one another? John 13:
12-17.


  Foot washing is a vital preparation for the communion service. Jesus said,
"You also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an exam-
ple, that you also should do as I have done to you" (John 13:14, 15, RSV).

ILLUMINATION: "Like Peter and his brethren, we too have been washed
in the blood of Christ, yet often through contact with evil the heart's purity is
soiled. We must come to Christ for His cleansing grace. Peter shrank from
bringing his soiled feet in contact with the hands of his Lord and Master; but
how often we bring our sinful, polluted hearts in contact with the heart of
                                                                              17
Christ! How grievous to Him is our evil temper, our vanity and pride! Yet all
our infirmity and defilement we must bring to Him. He alone can wash us
clean. We are mot prepared for communion with Him unless cleansed by His
efficacy. . . .
   "Now, having washed the disciples' feet, He said, 'I have given you an
example, that ye should do as I have done to you.' In these words Christ was
not merely enjoining the practice of hospitality. More was meant than the
washing of the feet of guests to remove the dust of travel. Christ was here
instituting a religious service. By the act of our Lord this humiliating cere-
mony was made a consecrated ordinance. It was to be observed by the disci-
ples, that they might ever keep in mind His lessons of humility and
service."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 646-650.

I11. THE INSTITUTION OF THE LORD'S SUPPER.

  After He had washed the disciples' feet, what service did Jesus insti-
tute? Matt. 26:26-28.


   The last supper that Jesus ate with His• disciples on the final Thursday
evening of His life was the celebration of the Passover. (See John 13:1.) The
Last Supper was the last Passover. The Passover pointed forward to the
sacrifice of the Messiah for the sins of the world. (See 1 Cor. 5:7.) The day
after the Passover supper Jesus was crucified. Then the Old Testament sanc-
tuary services that pointed forward to His death lost their significance. Ani-
mal sacrifices were replaced by the true Sacrifice, and earthly ministry gave
place to the heavenly High Priestly ministry of Jesus. (See Heb. 10:11, 12;
7:25.) This is why at the Last Supper Jesus instituted another service, the
Lord's Supper, to take the place of the Passover. The communion service
spans the gulf between Calvary and the Second Advent. The Passover
pointed forward to Calvary, while the Lord's Supper points back to Calvary.
Thus the Lord's Supper commemorates three events: (1) The completed sac-
rifice on the cross; (2) the coming of Jesus the second time; (3) the final
triumph of.God's people in the heavenly kingdom.

  How do we know that Jesus wants His followers to celebrate the
Lord's Supper until He comes the second time? 1 Cor. 11:23-26.



   What danger is there in partaking of the Lord's Supper if your heart
is not right with God? 1 Cor. 11:27-30.



ILLUMINATION: The following quotations reveal the Seventh-day Ad-
ventist attitude to and manner of celebrating the Lord's Supper:

  1. The Lord's Supper is to be a joyous, blessed occasion (see 1 Cor.
10:16):
18
         "But the Communion service was not to be a season of sorrowing. This
      was not its purpose. As the Lord's disciples gather about His table, they are
      not to remember and lament their shortcomings. They are not to dwell upon
      their past religious experience, whether that experience has been elevating
      or depressing. They are not to recall the differences between them and their
      brethren. The preparatory service has embraced all this. . . . Now they come
      to meet with Christ. They are not to stand in the shadow of the cross, but in
      its saving light."—The Desire of Ages, p. 659.

        2. Believers should be present and partake of the Supper as members
      of the body of Christ (see 1 Cor. 10:17):
         "All who come with their faith fixed upon Him will be greatly blessed.
      All who neglect these seasons of divine privilege will suffer loss. Of them it
      may appropriately be said, 'Ye are not all clean.' "—The Desire of Ages, p.
      656.

         3. All who wish to take part should be invited to (see Matt. 26:27):
         "Christ's example forbids exclusiveness at the Lord's Supper. It is true
      that open sin excludes the guilty. This the Holy Spirit plainly teaches (1 Cor.
      5:11). But beyond this none are to pass judgment. . . . There may come into
      the company persons who are not in heart servants of truth and holiness, but
      who may wish to take part in the service. They should not be forbidden. . . .
      None should exclude themselves from the Communion because some who
      are unworthy may be present."—The Desite of Ages, p. 656.

        4. Only unfermented wine is to be used (Prov. 20:1):
        "The unfermented wine that He provided for the wedding guests was a
      wholesome and refreshing drink. This is the wine that was used by our
      Saviour and His disciples in the first Communion. It is the wine that should
      always be used on the Communion table as a symbol of the Saviour's blood.
      The sacramental service is designed to be soul-refreshing and life-giving.
      There is to be connected with it nothing that could minister to evil."—
      Temperance, p. 97.

        5. Only unleavened bread should be used (1 Cor. 5:7, 8):
        "Bread that is leavened must not come on the Communion table;
      unleavened bread is the only correct representation of the Lord's
      Supper."—Ellen G. White comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p.
      1090. (See 1 Cor. 5:6-8.)

WED   IV. THE SPIRITUAL MEANING OF THE LORD'S SUPPER.

        What does it mean to partake of the body and blood of Christ? John
      6:51, 53-57, 63; 1 Cor. 10:16, 17.



         In His great sermon on the Bread of Life (John 6), Jesus clarified beyond
      doubt what it means to partake of His body and blood. The fact that He was
      using a metaphor becomes abundantly clear when we read John 6:63 (RSV):
      "It is the spirit that gives life, the flesh is of no avail; the words that I have
                                                                                     19
   spoken to you are spirit and life." We partake of Christ's body and blood
   when we receive His Word into our hearts. This we do by receiving the Holy
   Spirit to live within us. (See Rom. 8:9, 10; Eph. 3:16-21.)
      When we partake of the Lord's Supper we receive Jesus spiritually into
   our hearts. The literal bread and grape juice symbolize our spiritual recep-
   tion of the Lord, by the Holy Spirit. Christ is not literally present in the
   bread and wine. (See "What Others Teach" at the end of the lesson to
   capture the significance of this statement.) But Christ is present in the heart
   of the true believer who partakes of the bread and wine.

     How many times was Jesus sacrificed for our sins? Is the Lord's Sup-
   per a repetition of the sacrifice of Calvary? Heb. 7:27; 9:28; 10:14.


      Only once was it necessary for Jesus to be sacrificed for human guilt. The
   suffering that atoned for sin was not primarily physical. It was the suffering
   of the Deity caused by the separation of God the Father from God the Son.
   This separation broke the heart of the Son of God. That one sacrifice was
   sufficient to cover all sin for as long as this old world continues. The punish-
   ment Christ bore is adequate for every sinner no matter how degraded — if
   he will open his heart and accept Jesus as Saviour and Lord. (See Rom.
   5:17.)

TAU V. THE LORD'S SUPPER IN THE HEAVENLY KINGDOM.

      When did Jesus say the next occasion would be on which He would
   celebrate the Lord's Supper with His followers? Matt. 26:29



     What are the qualifications necessary for those who will feast with
   Jesus in the heavenly Kingdom? Rev. 19:7-9.


      Jesus looked forward to the day when He would celebrate the Lord's Sup-
   per with His redeemed people. It could well be that Jesus is waiting to drink
   of the fruit of the vine at the "marriage supper of the Lamb" (Rev. 19:9),
   when the triumph of His plan of salvation will be celebrated. He wants us to
   plan expectantly for that wonderful heavenly feast. Every time we celebrate
   the Lord's Supper, Christ is with us by the Holy Spirit. But our sights are to
   be set on the future when God's people will be free from sin and all its
   results. Then we will give eternal praise to our Lord for His infinite love.
     Those who by faith receive the free gift of Christ's righteousness will be
   taken to the kingdom to enjoy the heavenly Lcird's Supper. Christ's righ-
   teousness will dwell within believers as they allow the Holy Spirit to reign
   within. (See 1 John 2:29; 3:7; Gal. 2:20; Col. 1:27; Rev. 3:20.)
     Every time we partake of the Lord's Supper we receive Jesus by faith, and
   He becomes our indwelling righteousness, our qualification for the heavenly
   kingdom.
   20
FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: What similarities do you see
between the significance of the manna and the shewbread in ancient Israel
and the bread and wine partaken of by New Testament Christians? See Lev.
24:5-9; Deut. 8:3, 16; Neh. 9:19-21; Psalm 78:24, 25; John 6:27-63; Rev.
2:17. Read "A Servant of Servants" in The Desire of Ages, pages 642-661.

WHAT OTHERS TEACH: Most churches do not practice foot washing.
The Pope once a year seeks out a poor person and washes his feet. The
Seventh-day Adventist Church is the only worldwide denomination that
practices this simple but beautiful service.
   There are three major beliefs regarding the bread and the wine of the
Lord's Supper. For centuries many have accepted the doctrine of transub-
stantiation. This doctrine teaches that, when the priest pronounces the words
of consecration, the substance of the bread and the wine become the phys-
ical substance of Christ's body and blood. Each mass thus becomes a repeti-
tion of Calvary. By contrast, the Scriptures teach that there was only one
sacrifice for sin. (See Hebrews 7:27; 9:24-28; 10:12.)
   Others believe the doctrine of consubstantiation, which teaches that, even
though the substance of the bread and wine remains unchanged, the sub-
stance of Christ's physical body and blood are added to it. On Scriptural
grounds Seventh-day Adventists agree with those Protestant churches that
view the bread and wine as symbols of the body and blood of Christ.

HOW TO SHARE THIS TRUTH WITH OTHERS: Invite your friends
to attend a quarterly Communion service. Make sure that they understand
that if they are Christians they are welcome to participate, but that if they
would prefer they may simply observe. The preparatory service of foot
washing profoundly affects the observer. It becomes apparent that sinners
are saved by Christ's life, as well as His death. The foot washing commemo-
rates His life, and the bread and wine His death. The Holy Spirit can use this
service in a powerful way to impress people with the correctness and beauty
of the Scriptural message.

SUMMARY: Seventh-day Adventists believe that the spiritual preparation
for the Lord's Supper is to take place prior to and during the foot washing
service. This is a time for humble self-examination, repentance, and recon-
ciliation between brethren. The Lord's Supper is the sacred service in which
unleavened bread and unfermented wine are partaken of as a memorial of
Christ's sacrifice at Calvary. As believers receive the bread and wine, by
faith accepting Christ into their hearts, they are spiritually renewed. The
Lord's Supper is also a foretaste of the heavenly feast that the redeemed will
enjoy with Christ in His kingdom.
— APPLICATION
 • Do I understand that the service of foot washing constitutes a re-
    newal of the life commitment to Jesus that I made when baptized?
 • What is my attitude toward my Lord and other people when I partici-
    pate in this sacred service?
  o Do I absent myself from Communion services, and if so, why?
 • Have I invited any nonmember to visit this impressive service with
    me?

CENTRAL TEACHING: "Spiritual Gifts and Ministries. God bestows
on all members of His church in every age spiritual gifts which each member
is to employ in loving ministry for the common good of the church and of
humanity. Given by the agency of the Holy Spirit, who apportions to each
member as He wills, the gifts provide all abilities and ministries needed by
the church to fulfill its divinely ordained functions. According to the Scrip-
tures, these gifts include such ministries as faith, healing, prophecy, procla-
mation, teaching, administration, reconciliation, compassion, and self-
sacrificing service and charity for the help and encouragement of people.
Some members are called of God and endowed by the Spirit for functions
recognized by the church in pastoral, evangelistic, apostolic, and teaching
ministries particularly needed to equip the members for service, to build up
the church to spiritual maturity, and to foster unity of the faith and knowl-
edge of God. When members employ these spiritual gifts as faithful stew-
ards of God's varied grace, the church is protected from the destructive in-
fluence of false doctrine, grows with a growth that is from God, and is built
up in faith and love."—Fundamental Belief No. 16.

INTRODUCTION: Circumstances sometimes make it necessary for fam-
ilies to be separated for long periods. Often the separation is occasioned by
the necessity for the husband and father to travel in the interests of his pro-
fession, even being away from his homeland for many months. If he is a
responsible person, he will make certain that his family is well cared for
during his absence. In the final moments at the airport before takeoff, he is
likely to say, "If you need more money be sure to take some out of
savings." He also may review briefly some of the other provisions he has
made for the family's welfare. "I put new tires on the car." "I ordered
enough heating oil to last until I get back."
   Nineteen centuries ago, after establishing His church on earth, Jesus re-
turned to heaven. With anxious hearts the disciples watched Him ascend

(Luke 24:50, 51; Acts 1:9). Would they be able to represent Him ade-
quately? Would they be able to carry forward successfully the work He had
assigned them? Would they have the talents needed to carry the gospel to all
the world?
   With the same kind of compassion and consideration that characterized
His entire life, Jesus had foreseen their needs and made full provision for
them. Just before He ascended He said, "Behold, I send the promise of my
Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued
with power from on high" (Luke 24:49).
   Through the Holy Spirit, Jesus provided for the needs of His disciples and
church from the time of His ascension until He would return again. In fact,
the greatest outpouring of the Holy Spirit is yet to be received by His people.
This will take place as soon as the church is ready to facilitate the finishing
of God's work in the world.

I. THE PROMISE FULFILLED.

  Summarize in your own words Jesus' last promise to the disciples.
Acts 1:5, 8.



  When was Jesus' promise of the Holy Spirit realized by the infant
church? Eph. 4:8; Acts 2:1-4.


  While remaining in the upper room where they had partaken of the Last
Supper with Christ, the disciples prepared for the reception of the promised
Holy Spirit. Study the steps in preparation as outlined in The Acts of the
Apostles, pp. 36, 37.
   "They were weighted with the burden of the salvation of souls. They
realized that the gospel was to be carried to the world, and they claimed the
power that Christ had promised."—Page 37.

   What was the result of their preparations?

  "The Spirit came upon the waiting, praying disciples with a fullness that
reached every heart. The Infinite One revealed Himself in power to His
church. It was as if for ages this influence had been held in restraint, and
now Heaven rejoiced in being able to pour out upon the church the riches of
the Spirit's grace."—The Acts of the Apostles, p. 38.

  In what spectacular way was the prayer of the disciples for power to
win souls answered? Acts 2:41.



THINK IT THROUGH: In the light of the promise of the outpouring of
the latter rain, what do you think would happen if we today followed the
same steps in preparation that the disciples took in the upper room?

                                                                             23
      11. WHAT ARE THE GIFTS?

        How did Paul indicate that it is important for us to understand all we
      can about spiritual gifts? 1 Cor. 12:1.



      STUDY the chart that follows in order to gain a fuller understanding of
      what Paul includes in his listing of spiritual gifts:

                               Paul's List of Spiritual Gifts

                                          of tongues




         In the Greek, Ephesians 4:11 indicates that when Paul listed "pastors and
      teachers" he was not talking about two separate gifts, but one. That is why
      these are listed on one line in the chart and hyphenated.
         Notice that Paul's lists seem to vary because of the different reasons that
      he had in mind for listing the gifts in each passage mentioned. In Romans 12
      his emphasis is on the usefulness of the gifts listed. In Ephesians 4 there
      seems to be an attempt to list the order of importance to the church. In
      1 Corinthians 12:4-11 Paul stresses the communication factor involved.
      Later in this same chapter he apparently lists the gifts in order of importance
      once again. When we put the list found in 1 Corinthians 13 in inverted order
      (as in the chart) a listing of order of importance also becomes apparent,
      although his emphasis in this chapter is on the lasting effects of the gifts.

      THINK IT THROUGH: Which gift appears in each of these lists? Why
      is that significant to us today?


111   I11. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE GIFTS?

        What major purpose for the spiritual gifts do you see in Ephesians
      4:2, 3, 12, 13?
      24
       The gifts are not presented in order to build up the recipient, but to build
     up the body—the church—and to enable church members better to serve
     their community.

     ILLUSTRATION: "Some time ago my wife led a church youth group that
     wanted to do something significant for the community. Someone suggested
     that since several wealthy people lived in the community along with many
     others with needs, it might be possible to match the needs with some of that
     affluence.
        "The youth divided into two groups. One went door-to-door to the
     wealthy section of town asking what the people had that they might be will-
     ing to give away. The other half went to the less privileged part of the city to
     ask what the people needed.
        "A couple of hours later the two groups reconvened at the church and
     compared notes. What were the needs? What were the resources? Excite-
     ment reigned. Here was a mother in need of food for her baby, and here a
     family that had baby food left over after the visit of grandchildren. Here was
     a family who had no kitchen table, and another who had replaced theirs and
     had no room to store the old one.
        "Although the story is true, I see it also as a parable of what God wishes
     to accomplish in His church through the miracle of spiritual gifts. The Chris-
     tian church is a place where people can come to get help—of whatever
     kind. "—Don Jacobsen, "What Spiritual Gifts Mean to Me," Adventist Re-
     view, Dec. 25, 1986, pp. 11, 12.

        4.

        5

       What indication does Paul give that the gifts still are necessary in our
     day? Eph. 4:13.




El   IV. HOW DO THE GIFTS RANK IN IMPORTANCE?

      Why does the Spirit give different gifts to the members of the body of
     Christ? 1 Cor. 12:11-25.



        Although Paul shows the value of each distinct gift, there is a sense in
                                                                                   25
I Corinthians 12 through 14 in which some gifts are said to be more impor-
tant than others. (See 1 Cor. 12:31.) Refer to the chart under section II of the
lesson to review the way Paul ranks the gifts. One reason why he does so is
to demonstrate that the tongues phenomenon that was taking place in the
Corinthian church should not be given undue importance. (See chapter 14.)
   Notice that when it comes to the gift of tongues, it rates rather low on the
scale of importance Paul assigns. Instead of condemning the manifestation
of tongues in Corinth, Paul points out that there is a "more excellent way"
(1 Cor. 12:31). He then explains in 1 Corinthians 13 that none of the gifts
have real value unless they are combined with the gift of love. That Paul is
not referring to sentimental or natural human love becomes quite clear in his
development of chapter 13.

COMPARE Paul's lists of what love is and what it is not in 1 Corinthi-
ans 13 in order to understand more fully the kind of love about which he
is talking. The terms used will be clearer if you use a newer translation.

  What contrast is drawn between love and such gifts as prophecy,
knowledge, and tongues in 1 Corinthians 13:8-12?



  There are three particularly valuable and abiding gifts given to all
who accept Christ: (1) faith, (2) hope, and (3) love. Which is the most
important and significant gift of all? 1 Cor. 13:13. Why?



   In the last days it is this gift that brings in its train the greatest and fullest
outpouring of the Holy Spirit on God's people in the latter rain.
   Adventists believe that there are two major outpourings of the Holy
Spirit. The first was given to the church at Pentecost and has never been
taken away. It was Christ's special gift of love supplied in full measure in
order to meet the needs of His church throughout time.
   Paul testified in Romans 5:5, "The love of God is shed abroad in our
hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us." He expands on this
thought in Ephesians 3:17. After describing the power of the Holy Spirit to
change the inner life of those Christians to whom he was writing, he prayed
that "Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith" so that they would be
"rooted and grounded in love."
   This is primarily what the early rain experience is all about. It involves the
daily, hourly work of the Spirit in our lives, bringing about transformation
and victory over sin, covering us with Christ's righteousness. But the "in-
dwelling of the Spirit will be shown by the outflowing of heavenly love"
(Christ's Object Lessons, p. 419), and when the lovely character of Christ is
fully reproduced in His people, the latter rain will be poured out as a means
of calling the attention of the world to the love of God evidenced in His
church.
   We are told: "We may be sure that when the Holy Spirit is poured out,
those who did not receive ar d appreciate the early rain will not see or under-
stand the value of the latter rain."—Testimonies to Ministers, p. 399.

V. DISCOVERING YOUR GIFTS:

  What indicates that every church member has a gift or gifts? 1 Cor.
12:4-11.


  Two facts are worth noting: (1) The Spirit decides which gifts to bestow.
He takes this responsibility because He alone knows which gifts are needed
by the church. He alone knows which gifts each Christian will utilize. (2)
Not everyone receives the same gift, nor are all the gifts available to every-
one. Thus, for example, we do not have the right to insist that the Spirit give
us the gift of prophecy, the gift of healing, or the gift of tongues. Instead, we
will surrender fully to Christ, lay our natural talents on the altar, and ask
God to give us the specific gifts of the Spirit that He knows it is best for us to
have (Rom. 12:4-8; 1 Peter 4:10, 11). Whatever gifts God gives us He ex-
pects us to use in witnessing to others.

  How do we discover which gift or gifts God has given us?

  "The following suggestions have been helpful to me in seeking to dis-
cover God's gifts in myself and in others.

   "1. Walk closely with Jesus each day. Spiritual gifts are for spiritual
people. Sometimes I have felt-like doing nothing in Christ's service because
I have grown careless in my walk with Him.

  "2. Gather a group of fellow believers, perhaps including your pastor,
and carefully study the biblical topic of spiritual gifts.

   "3. Be willing to venture and experiment. If you sense a gentle nudge of
the Spirit, or are asked to undertake a new and unfamiliar task in your
church or community, don't immediately say 'No.' If it frightens you, ask if
you could try it for a month rather than a year, as an associate rather than the
leader.

  "4. After you have some experience, consult your own feelings. God-
appointed service, done in His way, will bring great satisfaction. While you
may not feel adequate or capable, you should find a sense of accomplish-
ment in knowing that you are using tools crafted especially for you.

  "5. Look for affirmation from other Spirit-led Christians. If God has
called and gifted you for some area of service, others of His family will
notice. Often in this setting God will confirm your gift. On the other hand, if
you receive no response, see no fruit, and feel constant drudgery in the task,
perhaps God wishes to call you to a different area of ministry.
  "God equips His Spirit-filled people to be the channels through whom He
can pour the rich resources of heaven upon those in need—in the church and
out. One of the most thrilling discoveries a Christian can make is to see
God's kingdom extended and humbly acknowledge, `God used me
there.' "—Don Jacobsen, "What Spiritual Gifts Mean to Me," Adventist
Review, Dec. 25, 1986, pp. 12, 13.
                                                                                27
FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read the chapter entitled
"The Gift of the Spirit" in The Acts of the Apostles, pages 47-56; —Christ's
Object Lessons, p. 328.
WHAT OTHERS TEACH: During the past few years the subject of spirit-
ual gifts has been a dominant theme in the evangelical world. It is a common
subject taught in numerous church seminaries. Seminars dealing with spirit-
ual gifts are being conducted constantly, teaching what spiritual gifts are and
how to use them. In some groups, spiritual gifts seem to focus mainly on
speaking in tongues. Speaking in tongues, however, is not limited to any
one group. It forms what might be termed a religious cross-cultural phenom-
enon. Not all manifestations of "tongues" are from heaven. In a world
where the supernatural is promoted, Christians must be certain to base their
beliefs about spiritual gifts exclusively on the Scriptures.
HOW TO SHARE THIS TRUTH WITH OTHERS: One of the fastest
growing religious movements that crosses denominational barriers is the
charismatic movement. Adherents to this theology believe that the baptism
of the Holy Spirit is proven initially by speaking with other tongues as the
Spirit gives them utterance. Seventh-day Adventists believe that Christ is
our example for the Christian life. For instance, He was baptized although
He did not need it in order to set us an example. It is interesting that there is
no record that He ever spoke in tongues, but His Jordan baptism did include
the Spirit baptism (Matt. 3:16).
   With our emphasis on spiritual gifts, including the gift of prophecy,
Seventh-day Adventists certainly believe in such gifts. But we do not be-
lieve that the gift of speaking in tongues is the sign that we have been bap-
tized by the Spirit. Not all are given the same gifts and, as has been devel-
oped in this lesson, even the genuine tongues is one of the lesser gifts in the
order of importance Paul presents. We need to set an example in using our
gifts to help to encourage others. We also need to help them recognize the
gifts God has given them and encourage them to put their gifts to work for
Him.
SUMMARY: In two or three brief sentences, summarize what you have
learned from this lesson:




— APPLICATION
 • Do I realize that all of the gifts of the Spirit emanate from the one
   Supreme Gift, Jesus Christ?
 • Am I making a study of the gifts of the Spirit in order to understand
   how they relate to me personally?
 • Do I daily pray for God to give me the gift of fitness to meet others in
   a redemptive way?
 • Do I understand that gifts do not come for the elevation of self but
   rather to send me out in sacrifice for others?
 • Do I realize that the remnant church, as the body of Christ, will be
   known not so much for what it teaches as for how it lives?

CENTRAL TEACHING: "The Gift of Prophecy. One of the gifts of the
Holy Spirit is prophecy. This gift is an identifying mark of the remnant
church and was manifested in the ministry of Ellen G. White. As the Lord's
messenger, her writings are a continuing and authoritative source of truth
which provide for the church comfort, guidance, instruction, and correc-
tion. They also make clear that the Bible is the standard by which all teach-
ing and experience must be tested. "—Fundamental Belief No. 17.

   I. What Was the Work of Inspired Bible Prophets?

 I11. How Can We Identify a True Prophet?
  IV. Will There Be True Prophets in the Last-Day Church?
   V. Has the Prophetic Gift Been Manifested in the Last-Day
      Church?

INTRODUCTION: Jesus predicted that in the last days there would arise
"false Christs, and false prophets" (Matt 24:24). Whatever fulfillments
there may have been of that prediction in past centuries, no one can doubt
that we are seeing it dramatically fulfilled today. False religious teachers,
people claiming to be Christ, and others claiming to have received direct
communications from God are prevalent in our contemporary world. It is
important that every Christian be able to distinguish the false from the true.
None of us wishes to be deceived in these last days before the second advent
of Jesus. The Bible has much to say about the work of prophets, and the
means by which the genuine prophetic gift can be identified.
   Since God gave special messages through the prophets in past ages for the
encouragement and spiritual enlightenment of His people, why can He not
use someone in that way in the twentieth century? Is God's power to com-
municate with His people any less today than it was in the time of Elijah or
Jeremiah? Why should we accept the reality of miraculous prophetic inspira-
tion in earlier ages but deny it for our age? If we should discover that the
tests of a true prophet are fulfilled in the ministry of a modern individual,
then how unwise we would be not to accept the messages as coming from
God! To reject the counsel of a true prophet is to insult the Holy Spirit.
                                                                           29
I. WHAT WAS THE WORK OF INSPIRED BIBLE PROPHETS?

SEARCH AND LEARN: What do the following Bible passages tell us
about the work of Bible prophets?

     o Luke 24:27

     0 2 Tim. 3:16, 17

     O 1 Peter 1:10, 11

     0 Jer. 28.9

     O 1 Chron. 29:29, 30

   The primary purpose of all divine prophecy is the revelation of Jesus
Christ as the only way of salvation. God gave prophetic messages to lead
lost souls to the Saviour. Sometimes the instruction given had timeless rel-
evance. It was intended not only for the prophet's day but also for every
subsequent age. In such cases the messages were recorded for future genera-
tions. Sometimes the messages were intended especially for the prophet's
own contemporaries. In such cases, the messages were not preserved for
future ages. The writings of such prophets as Nathan, Gad, Ahijah, and Jehu
are not in the sacred canon (the collection of Bible books) because they did
not have special application for future generations. Some problems in God's
church are local as to time and place. The Lord has sometimes chosen spe-
cial prophets to meet such local situations. For instance, the Spirit of the
Lord came upon Jahaziel, who prophesied before the people of Judah during
the reign of Jehoshaphat. He assured them of victory over their enemies the
next day. He uttered the famous words "For the battle is not your's but
God's" (2 Chron. 20:15).
   An inspired prophet is not necessarily a canonical prophet. The messages
of inspired non-canonial prophets came directly from God, just as did the
messages of canonical prophets. The only difference was that the writings of
the canonical prophets were selected by God for inclusion in the Bible. The
messages of non-canonical prophets may have been a repetition of counsels
already included in the written Scriptures, or they may have been designed
to meet some local situation.

   Women as well as men were called to the prophetic office. Name some
of them:

     0 Ex. 15:20, 21

     0 Judges 4:4, 5

     0 2 Kings 22:14

     o Luke 2:36

     0 Acts 21.9
30
   The Lord does not discriminate on the basis of sex when choosing persons
to communicate His special messages to the people. Often He has chosen
godly women as instruments of His special revelations.

11. HOW DID THE PROPHETS RECEIVE THEIR MESSAGES?

  In what main ways did God's messages come to the prophets?

  • Hosea 12:10

  • Dan 7.1

  • Dan. 8:16, 17

  • Eze. 2:2, 3

  • 2 Sam. 23:1-3

   The direct communications of the Holy Spirit were sometimes heard audi-
bly, and sometimes recognized as an unmistakable inner command. The
messages given inaudibly were not the same as the conviction of the Holy
Spirit that every believer experiences. There was direct communication
from the mind of God to the mind of the prophet, so that a specific divine
message was communicated. The prophet knew that his responsibility was
to pass on this message to the people.

ILLUMINATION: "It is not the words of the Bible that are inspired, but
the men that were inspired. Inspiration acts not on the man's words or his
expressions but on the man himself, who, under the influence of the Holy
Ghost, is imbued with thoughts. But the words receive the impress of the
individual mind. The divine mind is diffused. The divine mind and will is
combined with the human mind and will; thus the utterances of the man are
the word of God."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 21.
   "We believe the light given by God to His servants is by the enlighten-
ment of the mind, thus imparting the thoughts, and not (except in rare cases)
the very words in which the ideas should be expressed. "—General Confer-
ence Proceedings, Review and Herald, Nov. 27, 1883.

  What physical state did the prophet sometimes experience when in
vision? Dan. 10:7-9, 16-19; Num. 24:3, 4, 16; 2 Cor 12:1-4.



   The Bible does not teach that the physical state of the prophet while in
vision was always the same. Nor are we told that the physical phenomena
are to be used as a test of the genuineness of a prophet's claims. The phys-
ical state of the prophet in vision can be counterfeited. If the physical phe-
nomena are present when other Bible tests of a true prophet give positive
results, they can be regarded as supporting evidence of the genuineness of
the gift.
                                                                           31
         In what two ways did prophets pass on God's messages to the people?
       Isa. 6:9-11; Jer. 36:1, 2.



TRUE   I11. HOW CAN WE IDENTIFY A TRUE PROPHET?

         With what teachings will the true prophet's messages be consistent?
       Isa. 8:20; Rev. 22:18, 19 (compare Jer. 23:16, 21, 22, 28).



         Isaiah 8:20 may be translated as the New International Version renders it:
       "To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this
       word, they have no light of dawn." If they do not teach according to the
       Bible, then you know that their message did not come from God.

       ILLUMINATION: "The word of God is the standard by which all teaching
       and experience must be tested."—The Great Controversy, p. v11.
         "God will have a people upon the earth to maintain the Bible, and the
       Bible only, as the standard of all doctrines and the basis of all reforms."—
       The Great Controversy, p. 595.
         "The Bible, and the Bible alone, is to be our creed, the sole bond of
       union; all who bow to this Holy Word will be in harmony. "—Selected Mes-
       sages, bk. 1, p. 416.

         What will be the spiritual results of a true prophet's teaching in his
       own life and in the lives of those he influences? Matt. 7:15-20.



          One of the major signs of the end will be false prophets whose main work
       is deception. (See Matt. 24:4, 11, 24.) Christ has given His true followers
       the right to be fruit-inspectors: " 'By their fruit you will recognize them' "
       (Matt. 7:20, NIV).

         How reliable are the predictions of a true prophet of God? Deut.
       18:20-22; Jer. 28:9.



          Some divine predictions are conditional upon man's response. Nineveh
       was saved, despite Jonah's predictions that it would be destroyed. The peo-
       ple fulfilled the condition for the divine sentence to be waived. (See Jonah
       3:10.) Many of the divine promises to literal Israel could not be fulfilled
       because of the people's continuing apostasy. (See Jer. 18:7-10.) Neverthe-
       less, the test is valid; true prophets do not make false predictions.

         What will the true prophet teach in regard to Jesus Christ? 1 John
       4:1-3.

       • Joel 2:28-32

       • Eph. 4:11-14

       • Rev. 12:17

       • Rev. 19:10
        Joel's prophecy establishes that in the last days some faithful ones will
     receive visions and dreams from the Lord.
        The "testimony of Jesus Christ" that John refers to in Revelation 12:17 is
     defined in Revelation 19:10. The angel clearly meant that, like John, he had
     prophetic messages from Christ.
        The point is that "the testimony of Jesus Christ" in the book of Revelation
     refers to more than the work of the Holy Spirit in every believing heart. It
     refers to the work of inspired prophets who, like John, have received vi-
     sions, dreams, and special verbal communications to be given to humanity.
     The Lord promised through Joel and John that He would give prophetic
     messages in the last days to lead people back to the Bible and back to Jesus.

       What should be our attitude to the work of genuinely inspired proph-
     ets? 1 Thess. 5:19-21; 2 Chron. 20:20; compare Matt 23:37, 38.


TS   V. HAS THE PROPHETIC GIFT BEEN MANIFESTED IN THE
        LAST-DAY CHURCH?

       The Seventh-day Adventist Church believes that the true gift of prophecy
     was manifested in the ministry of Ellen G. White. The questions that follow
     are suggested by the foregoing Bible study:
        1. What did Ellen White claim for herself?
        "I have had no claims to make, only that I am instructed that I am the
     Lord's messenger; that He called me in my youth to be His messenger, to
     receive His word, and to give a clear and decided message in the name of the
     Lord Jesus. . . .
        "Why have I not claimed to be a prophet? — Because in these days many
     who boldly claim that they are prophets are a reproach to the cause of Christ;
     and because my work includes much more than the word 'prophet'
     signifies."—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 32.

       2. Did Ellen White claim to have had visions and dreams from the
     Lord?
       Many times in her writings she refers to visions and dreams given to her
     by God. See Testimonies, vol. 1, pp. 58-61, 67-71, 72, 74, 76-77, 79, 83.
                                                                                 33
     3. Does Ellen White measure up to the tests of a true prophet?

   0 The consistency of her writings with Scripture. Ellen White's
writings teach no doctrine that cannot be substantiated solely from Scrip-
ture. Her writings lead us back to the Bible. They provide simple explana-
tions of Bible truths, that should have been understood by those professing
to believe Scripture.
   Ellen White did not teach that her writings should be used as another
Bible, or that they should be added to the sacred canon: "I recommend to
you, dear reader, the Word of God as the rule of your faith and practice. By
that Word we are to be judged. God has, in that Word, promised to give
visions in the 'last days'; not for a new rule of faith, but for the comfort of
His people, and to correct those who err from Bible truth."— Early
Writings, p. 78.
   "Little heed is given to the Bible, and the Lord has given a lesser light to
lead men and women to the greater light."— Review and Herald, Jan. 20,
1903, p. 15.

   o The fruitage of Ellen White's work. The noble Christian character of
Ellen White was attested to by many of those who knew her. (See Arthur L.
White's biography entitled Ellen G. White, 6 volumes. These volumes are a
rich source of information regarding the beginning and development of the
Advent movement as well as the work of Ellen White. See also F. D. Nichol,
Ellen G. White and Her Critics.) The fruitage of Ellen White's work in the
lives of others is demonstrated in two ways:
   The growth of the Seventh-day Adventist work and institutions around the
world: No other denomination the size of the Seventh-day Adventist Church
has educational, medical, and publishing work as large and widespread.
This is mainly attributable to Ellen White's work as God's messenger.
   The spiritual impact of her writings: Millions have been drawn to Christ
and the Bible through her published works. The only way to test her influ-
ence for yourself is to read her works.

  ,0 Ellen White's predictions have been accurate. All of the uncondi-
tional predictions applying to the period prior to our day have been fulfilled.
Current events reveal the gradual fulfillment of her predictions for the last
days. (See the final chapters of The Great Controversy.)
   In 1848 she correctly predicted the amazing growth of the Seventh-day
Adventist publishing work. (See Life Sketches, p. 125.) In the earliest stages
of spiritualism's growth in America, she predicted that it would become a
world religion. (See Early Writings, pp. 43, 59, 87.)
   In 1890 she predicted the destruction that we have seen in two world
wars. (See Messages to Young People, pp. 89, 90.)
   Arthur L. White's six-volume biography of Ellen G. White provides con-
vincing evidence that her predictions regarding the lives of individuals and
the circumstances of the church have been remarkably fulfilled.

   0 Ellen White exalted Christ. Her writings constantly exalt Christ as the
only Source of salvation, the Head of the church, the all-sufficient Sacrifice,
the forgiving Mediator, and the merciful Judge. She depicts Christ as Deity

34
in the highest sense, and human in every respect except sin. (See The Desire
of Ages, Christ's Object Lessons, Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing.)
Her book Steps to Christ is a superb commentary on the Bible teaching of-
righteousness by faith in Jesus.

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Are later inspired prophets au-
thoritative interpreters of earlier prophets? See Rom. 10:5-10 (compare Lev.
18:5; Eze. 20:11, 13, 21; Neh. 9:29; Deut. 30:11-14); Rom. 1:16, 17 (com-
pare Hab. 2:4); 1 Cor. 9:9 (compare Deut. 25:4); Gal. 4:22-24 (compare the
Old Testament account); Matt. 24:15 (compare Dan. 8:13; 9:27); Acts 2:17-
21 (compare Joel 2:28-32); Acts 2:25-28 (compare Ps. 16:8-11).
   Did Ellen White regard her writings as providing inspired interpretations
of Scripture? See Colporteur Ministry, p. 126; Testimonies, vol. 8, p. 236;
Testimonies to Ministers, p. 402; Gospel Workers, p. 302; This Day With
God, p. 317.

WHAT OTHERS TEACH: Christian churches in general do not deny that
prophets have existed since apostolic times. Even so, their description of
this spiritual gift is usually quite broad and indefinite. There are those who
consider great leaders such as Luther, Wycliffe, and Calvin to have been
prophets. Several TV evangelists, -who may not claim to be prophets, testify
to having visions, dreams, or special •communications from God. Others
teach that, in a sense, every Christian is a prophet, because the Spirit of
Christ has come upon all flesh. Some churches claim that the prophetic gift
is manifested in their midst. How important it is to apply the principles of
this lesson in order to avoid deception.

HOW TO SHARE THIS TRUTH WITH OTHERS: Many find that the
best way to share this truth with others is the "taste and see method." Share
a book written by Ellen G. White, such as The Desire of Ages, The Ministry
of Healing, Christ's Object Lessons, or Steps to Christ. Before presenting
the book, give .a warm personal testimony as to the blessing you have re-
ceived by.reading it and following its principles. Do not reveal any details
about the author until after they have read the work for themselves. If their
response is positive share with them who Ellen White was.

SUMMARY: Seventh-day Adventists believe that the genuineness of a pro-
fessed prophet can be determined by the application of the tests given in
Scripture. When these tests are applied to Ellen White, she is found to be an
inspired modern prophet.

—APPLICATION
 • Am I grateful for the counsel God has given through both the Bible
   and the writings of Ellen G. White?
 • Do I spend as much time daily with these messages as I do watching
   television?
 • Am I making efforts to share Ellen White's books with others who
   need to receive their special inspiration and guidance.

What God's Law
Tens Us About God
      MEMORY TEXT: "Do we then make void the law through faith?
LL
 I !J
   r1 God forbid: yea, we establish the law" (Rom. 3:31).

CENTRAL THOUGHT: "The Law of God. The great principles of
God's law are embodied in the Ten Commandments and exemplified in the
life of Christ. They express God's love, will, and purposes concerning hu-
man conduct and relationships and are binding upon all people in every age.
These precepts are the basis of God's covenant with His people and the
standard of God's judgment. Through the agency of the Holy Spirit they
point out sin and awaken a sense of need for a Saviour. Salvation is all of
grace and not of works, but its fruitage is obedience to the Commandments.
This obedience develops Christian character and results in a sense of well-
being. It is an evidence of our love for the Lord and our concern for our
fellow men. The obedience of faith demonstrates the power of Christ to
transform lives, and therefore strengthens Christian witness."—Fundamen-
tal Belief No. 18.

OUTLINE:
   I. The Law Reveals God's Love.
  11. The Law Measures Christian Growth.
 I11. The Law in the New Testament.
  IV. A Faith That Works.
   V. The Results of Faith at Work.

INTRODUCTION: A man journeying by foot was puzzled yet amused by
a sign he came across in front of a convent. It read:

                                KEEP OUT

                          SISTERS OF MERCY

As he continued his travels he meditated on the apparent inconsistency.
  Some see an inconsistency between the Bible's emphasis on combining
law with grace, faith with works, and justice with mercy. But there is no
inconsistency.
   God thundered His love at Mt. Sinai. He expanded its meaning in the
Sermon on the Mount. But He displayed its depth and fullness at Mt. Cal-
vary. Sinai still symbolizes law and Calvary symbolizes grace. Yet one is
not complete without the other. Sinai shows us what God's love is like and
how far we are removed by nature from living a life that reflects His love.
Calvary shows us that God's law could not be changed, thus God Himself
                                                                       - 37
had to pay the price for our sins. Because the Christ who died on the cross
spoke the law on Sinai (see Evangelism, p. 616) both carry the message of
God's love in a consistent fashion.
   Because "God is love" (1 John 4:8), we live in a universe characterized
by law and order. Not only did the Creator set in operation the laws that
govern the clockwork-like movements of the heavenly bodies but He also
instituted laws that regulate the life and health of the human beings He
placed on this planet. These laws are intended to enhance rather than inhibit
life. The "more abundant" life Jesus promised in John 10:10 to those who
follow Him comes when by His grace we conform to the laws of life and
health.
   These laws hold before us an ideal and imply a promise that, through
Christ, we can measure up to the ideal.

I. THE LAW REVEALS GOD'S LOVE.

  Seventh-day Adventists believe that God's law is eternal in principle. As
the transcript of His character, it demonstrates what His love is like.
COMPARE the attributes of God with the law's inherent qualities by
studying the comparisons that follow:

          God                     Attribute                    Law
        Ezra 9:15                 Righteous                Psalm 119:172
        Matt. 5:48                 Perfect                 Psalm 19:7
        Lev. 19:2                   Holy                   Rom. 7:12
        Psalm 34:8                  Good                   Rom. 7:12
        Deut. 32:4                  Truth                  Psalm 119:142

  How does Matthew 22:36-40 sum up the essence of the law?



   Jesus made it clear that He did not come to change the law of God. The
first four of the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20:3-11 deal with our rela-
tionship to God. The last six in Exodus 20:12-17 are concerned primarily
with our relationships with people about us.

ILLUMINATION: "If man love God in all the breadth and beauty sug-
gested by the words 'with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy
mind,' he cannot possibly find room for another God, and so the first word
is kept. If man love God supremely, he will not suffer anything to stand
between him and God, thus the graven image is broken to pieces, and swept
away by the force of a stronger affection. Out of love will spring that
hallowing of the name of God which will dry the springs of blasphemy, and
make the double dealing of the hypocrite an impossibility. The Sabbath will
be eagerly welcomed, and all its privileges earnestly and gladly appropriated
when it is a season in which love may find its way into the attitude of wor-
ship, and the acts of service following therefrom.
   "Passing to the second table, and looking now at love in its working
38
toward others, it will at once be seen that the only sufficient power for obe-
dience and honor rendered to parents is that of love. There will be no
thought of murder until the awful moment has arrived in which the flame of
love has died out upon the altar. Unchastity of every description is love's
sure destruction, growing gross upon the very death of that which it so vilely
personates. All theft is rendered impossible by true love for one's neighbor.
Love sits as a sentinel at the portal of the lips, and arrests the faintest whis-
per of false witness against a neighbor; nay, rather dwells within the heart,
and slays the thought that might have inspired the whisper. It is love and
love alone that, finding satisfaction in God, satisfies the heart's hunger, and
prevents all coveting."—G. Campbell Morgan, The Ten Commandments,
(New York: Fleming H. Revell Company, 1901), pp. 120, 121.
   In Romans 13:10 Paul succinctly summarizes in a single statement what it
takes to keep the law: "Love is the fulfilling of the law."
11. THE LAW MEASURES CHRISTIAN GROWTH.

   One outstanding feature of God's laws often overlooked is that, although
they set minimum boundaries, there are no maximum limits. We are told not
to kill or hate. But there is no limit to our expressing God's kind of love.
Although we are not to steal from either God or those about us, there is no
limit to how much of what we have can be given to bless God's work or
others.
  What is new about Jesus' new commandment? John 13:34.

   The new commandment was not intended to add to or transcend the Ten
Commandments. It was intended to enhance them by a new and unique ex-
ample of how they could be kept. Jesus came to give us a new perspective of
the purpose, power, and promise of God's law. Jesus came to this world not
only to show us how to live according to the laws of God but to provide the
transforming grace that alone can enable us to surrender fully to God's will
for us as it is expressed in His laws. Rather than being requirements for
getting into heaven, God's laws become to the consecrated Christian a mea-
sure or yardstick of his growing experience as well as a challenge to keep on
growing in grace.
   The Ten Commandments express God's love, will, and purposes con-
cerning human conduct and are just as binding and meaningful to people
today as they were when they were first given. Although most are expressed
in negative "Thou shalt nots," they are not restrictions so much as they are
word pictures of the kind of character God's children will reflect when they
choose to live as He would have them live. They can be expressed in the
positive sense as follows:
     1. Loyalty—God will be first. If we are Christ's our thoughts are of
Him. We will seek the spiritual, not the material. We will long to bear His
 image, breathe His Spirit, do His will, and please Him in all things because
 we love Him.
     2. Worship—We worship the unseen, not the seen. The things we once
 hated we now love, and the things we once loved we now hate.
     3. Reverence—The vain customs and fashions of the world are laid
 aside. Our conversation, affections, and sympathies are in heaven. Our
                                                                              39
       hearts are kept tender and subdued by the Spirit of Christ.
            4. Sanctification—Christ is recognized as Creator and Re-Creator, not
       only by our keeping the seventh part of time but in our full acceptance of the
       rest of redemption. His holiness is evidenced in our lives, and the works of
       holiness, which previously seemed dull, uninteresting, and wearisome, are
       now our delight.
            5. Respect for Authority—This begins in the home between parents and
       children, but extends to all relationships, with both God and man. Disobedi-
       ence and rebellion are replaced by obedience and cooperation.
            6. Respect for Life—Truly converted persons respect their own lives as
       well as those of others. Love, humility, and peace take the place of anger,
       envy, and strife. Our souls are imbued with divine love and captivated with
       the heavenly mysteries. The fruit of the Spirit—love—is evidenced in the
       life.
            7. Purity—There is a complete transformation—passion, appetites, and
       will are brought into perfect submission to God. The former life appears
       disgusting and sinful. Sinful thoughts are put away, and evil deeds are re-
       nounced because of our love for God and respect for His will.
            8. Honesty—This involves our relationships and the way we carry on
       business affairs with our fellow humans. It also characterizes our relation-
       ship with God. Instead of robbing God of such things as our health, time,
       tithe, and offerings, we gladly dedicate all we have to Him. Duty becomes a
       delight, and sacrifice a pleasure.
            9. Truthfulness—By our words we shall be justified or condemned.
       When the heart is right our words and deeds will be right, and we will be-
       come men and women of strict integrity.
           10. Contentment—The practice of holiness will be pleasant when there is
       perfect surrender to God. Joy takes the place of sadness and covetousness.
       The countenance reflects the peace and happiness of heaven.

       THINK IT THROUGH: As I measure my current state of Christian
       development by the ten positive principles of God's law, in what specific
       area or areas do I need the Holy Spirit's help in order better to repre-
       sent the character of God to those about me?

       I11. THE LAW IN THE NEW TESTAMENT.
TRUE
         What was Christ's attitude toward and relationship to the law? Matt.
       5:17-19; John 14:15.



         Christ fulfilled the moral law by living the principles of the law in His
       love for God and for humanity. Such love fired His mission. He did not
       come to destroy the law. How could He destroy His love by loving? His
       entire life exemplified what God's love is like. It included being willing to
       go to the cross for the undeserving. When Jesus hung helpless on Calvary—
       lonely and hated—He took all the mockery, jeers, taunts, and rejection,
       gasping, "Father, forgive them." As He hung there, He gave the greatest
       demonstration of the law's eternal principles. Any idea that what happened
       on the cross changed the law comes from a superficial understanding of
       40
       what took Jesus to and kept Him on the cross. If there was any way that God
       could have saved the world and also spared His Son this utter ignominy and
       devastating anguish He would have done it. But salvation's plan demands
       love for the undeserving. It involves loving the unworthy, loving them for
       their sake and not for one's own sake. God went to the cross willingly in an
       utter self-abandonment for others. This selfless act opens up the very mean-
       ing of the law.
          The unchangeable principles that constitute the basis of God's nature are
       the basis of His government in heaven and on earth. Both Old and New
       Testaments reveal the inextricable union of God with his law.

WED    IV. A FAITH THAT WORKS.
1111
        Analyze Hebrews 11:6. What is the proper balance between faith and
       works?


         Faith is the absolute essential. If it is missing, then nothing else will en-
       sure our salvation. Hebrews 11:6 implies that when we live the life of faith it
       will be possible for us to please God.

         What was the result of Enoch's faith? Heb. 11:5.


          Through Enoch God proved to the world and to the universe that sinful,
       fallen human beings can achieve perfect characters by God's grace through
       faith.

       ILLUMINATION: Enoch "was a light amid the moral darkness, a pattern
       man, a man who walked with God, being obedient to God's law—that law
       which Satan had refused to obey, which Adam had transgressed, which
       Abel obeyed, and because of his obedience was murdered. And now God
       would demonstrate to the universe the falsity of Satan's charge that man
       cannot keep God's law. He would demonstrate that though man had sinned,
       he could so relate himself to God that he would have the mind and spirit of
       God and would be a representative symbol of Christ. This holy man was
                                                                                   41
      selected of God to denounce the wickedness of the world, and to evidence to
      the world that it is possible for men to keep all the law of God. . . .
         "Enoch walked with God and 'had the testimony that his ways pleased_
      God.' This is the privilege of every believer today."—Ellen G. White, The
      Upward Look, p. 228.

      ILLUSTRATION: The painting of the motto for the 1947 Washington
      Conference camp meeting was assigned to a local shop. The word faith was -
      supposed to be placed on one side of the main theme and the word works on
      the other. Misunderstanding his instructions, the sign painter put these
      words at the center bottom portion of the banner so that it read, "Faith
      works." Although that was not what was intended, it made a most appropri-
      ate motto, for faith does not stand alone, isolated by itself. Wherever genu-
      ine faith is manifested it is faith that works.
         A faith without works is a faith that does not work. John. Calvin put it this.
      way: "We are saved by faith alone, but faith is never alone."

           What does Galatians 2:17-21 tell us about how faith works?


         "In order for man to be justified by faith, faith must reach a point where it
      will control the affections and impulses of the heart; and it is by obedience
      that faith itself -is made perfect. "—Selected Messages, bk. 1, p. 366.

TAU   V. THE RESULTS OF FAITH AT WORK.-

        "Faith quickens the senses to work diligently to produce results. "—Ellen
      G. White, The Upward Look, p. 72.
        Among the results of faith at work are the following:

        1. Keeping the Commandments and Following God's Will. Before
      Christ can come, God must demonstrate to the universe through a significant
      number of human examples that fallen humanity can keep His command-
      ments through partaking the divine nature. (See 2 Peter 1:3, 4.)

        How does Revelation 14:12 summarize what the three angels' mes-
      sages are about?


        Last-day commandment keepers are motivated by love. They love God so
      much that they are willing to do whatever He says, no matter what the con-
      sequences to themselves.

           What attitude characterizes true commandment keeping? 1 John 5:3.



         The keeping of God's law brings us the happiness and blessing that God
      intended His laws to bring to His people. Through disobedience we cheat
      ourselves of the blessings that harmony with God's laws brings.
      42
   2. Heeding Christ's Commission. Hearts filled with the love of God
naturally will do everything possible to save others. Commandment keepers
do not have to be pushed into witnessing. It becomes their delight. Anytime
we discover the thrill of something better we are eager to share it with oth-
ers. Our loving service also is motivated by a sense of urgency in this final
judgment hour when the close of probation is fast approaching. In witness-
ing it is not what we say that impresses others so much as the way we dem-
onstrate the blessing of acommandment-keeping life-style.

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: "He who is trying to reach
heaven by his own works in keeping the law, is attempting an impossibility.
Man cannot be saved without obedience, but his works should not be of
himself; Christ should work in him to will and do of His good pleasure. If a
man could save himself by his own works, he might have something in
himself in which to rejoice. . . . All that man can do without Christ is pol-
luted with selfishness and sin; but that which is wrought through faith is
acceptable to God."—Selected Messages, bk 1, p. 364.
   "This comparison between God and His law has always impressed me.
Do I wish to know what God is like? Then I study what has been revealed in
His law,-for its-attributes are His.
   "Do I wish to know by what kind of law God governs His people? Then I
need only to read what the Scriptures reveal about the character of my Fa-
ther, for His character is revealed in His law.
   "Do I wish to know what kind of behavior will result if I live in obedi-
ence? Then I need to consider Christ Himself. His life was the law trans-
muted into a radiant, vibrant experience!
   "Thus, as a Christian, I do not see the Ten Commandments as an expres-
sion of an arbitrary or a self-seeking will. Rather, they are the revelation of
the character of the heavenly Father, an expression of His-gracious will-for'
my happiness in the created order of things. In effect, He is saying 'This is
the best and happiest way to live on Planet Earth.' "—Frank B. Holbrook,
"What God's Law Means to Me," Adventist Review, January 15, 1987, p.
16.
WHAT OTHERS TEACH: In general most Christian churches subscribe
to the Ten Commandments. If you ask Christians about each individual
commandment, as to whether they should be observed, most will agree in
the affirmative. But when the fourth commandment is reached usually the
response is that the Sabbath has been changed from the seventh day to the
first day of the week. Some denominations teach that the Ten Command-
ments were nailed to the cross, but after Pentecost all but the fourth were
reinstated for Christians to keep. Catholics and Lutherans follow the lead of
St. Augustine (354-430 A.D.) joining the first and second commandments
together and dividing the tenth. Tragically, little thought is given to the Ten
Commandments in Christendom, and few sermons are preached about the
Law of God. The theological pendulum swings between legalism and
antinomianism ("there is no law"). Adventists virtually stand alone in at-
tempting to balance God's judgment with His mercy—His law with grace.

HOW TO SHARE THIS TRUTH WITH OTHERS: The most effective
way of teaching this truth is to make certain that through the power of the
                                                                            43
Holy Spirit you are obeying God's law to the best of your knowledge. Then,
and only then, can you testify to the benefits of obedience to God's will.
Make certain that you have a thorough understanding of the relationship of
law and grace, faith and works, in order to avoid a legalistic approach. Obe-
dience must be taught within the framework of a love response. I obey God
because I love Him and for what He has done for me. I do not obey Him
thinking that this gives me merit towards salvation.
   In addition, teach the law as a blessing. None of God's rules are arbi-
trary—there is a reason for every one of His commandments. When they are
obeyed, life and blessings result. Also show how disobedience to any of
God's laws carries with it an inherent penalty. God is not waiting to strike a
violator of His law down. The violator will suffer the penalty that is inherent
in disobedience to the commandments.

SUMMARY: God's remnant people believe in the perpetuity of the law of
God. The law is the focal point of the great controversy between Christ and
Satan. It is as eternal as God, being an expression of His character of love.
Love to God and love to others make up the essence of the law.

—APPLICATION

   heart?
 o Do I understand that true lawkeeping is a love response to Jesus
   Christ?
 o Do I understand that the Ten Commandments constitute God's char-
   acter in words?
 o Do I daily pray that the Commandments will become a part of my
   very being?

     God "refills Us About
     the Sabbath
     SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "But pray ye that your flight be not in the
     PM    winter, neither on the sabbath day" (Matt. 24:20).

     CENTRAL TEACHING: "The Sabbath. The beneficent Creator, after
     the six days of Creation, rested on the seventh day and instituted the Sabbath
     for all people as a memorial of Creation. The fourth commandment of God's
     unchangeable law requires the observance of this seventh-day Sabbath as the
     day of rest, worship, and ministry in harmony with the teaching and practice
     of Jesus, the Lord of the Sabbath. The Sabbath is a day of delightful commu-
     nion with God and one another. It is a symbol of our redemption in Christ, a
     sign of our sanctification, a token of our allegiance, and a foretaste of our
     eternal future in God's kingdom. The Sabbath is God's perpetual sign of His
     eternal covenant between Him and His people. Joyful observance of this
     holy time from evening to evening, sunset to sunset, is a celebration of
     God's creative and redemptive acts. "—Fundamental Belief No. 19.

        I. The Institution of the Sabbath.
       11. The Sabbath in the Old Testament.
      I11. Christ and the Sabbath.
       IV. The Apostles and the Sabbath.

     INTRODUCTION: How do we establish from Scripture that the seventh
     day of the week is the Sabbath that the Lord wishes us to observe?
        Why does He ask His believing people to keep the Sabbath day holy?
     Does the observance of the Sabbath have any bearing on our spiritual lives,
     or is it merely an option that God suggests because He knows that people
     would become over-tired if they worked seven days a week?
        Seventh-day Adventist Christians are convinced that God's last-day seal
     is given to those who have entered into a special spiritual relationship with
     Christ. This relationship is the motivation and the power for obedience to all
     God's requirements, including Sabbath observance. In this sense, the Sab-
     bath is the last-day seal of God.
        What does the Bible teach about the manner in which we should observe
     the Sabbath? Committed Christians want to do just what Jesus asks of them.
     They choose to observe the day He specifies, in the manner He specifies.

     I. THE INSTITUTION OF THE SABBATH.
Fl     What were the three distinct acts by which God created the Sabbath?
     Gen 2:1-3.
                                                                                45

       At the end of Creation week, when the world, its animal kingdom, and its
    two human inhabitants came forth in absolute perfection from the Creator's
    hand, God brought the Sabbath into existence. The Sabbath was not un-
    known prior to the giving of the law at Sinai, as many Christians believe. It
    is not a uniquely Jewish institution. Two institutions—marriage and the
    family and the seventh day Sabbath—date back to Creation.
       God did not rest at the end of Creation week because He was weary in the
    human sense. (See Isa. 40:28.) Yet he "rested, and was refreshed" (Ex.
    31:17). (See also Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 47.)

      Who was the Creator who rested on, blessed, and sanctified the Sab-
    bath day? Col. 1:13-16; Heb. 1:1, 2.



       If Christ the Son created all things, then He certainly created the Sabbath.
    Therefore the Sabbath is a Christian institution. He did not give the Sabbath
    only to the Jews as a part of a temporary ceremonial system of laws. He
    instituted the Sabbath for all humanity for all time. (See The Desire of Ages,
    p. 281.)


n   H. THE SABBATH IN THE OLD TESTAMENT.

      Was the Sabbath observed by God's people before the giving of the
    law at Sinai? Gen. 26:5; Ex. 16:4, 5, 22-26.



       Abraham's experience is presented in both Old and New Testaments as a
    great example of righteousness by faith in Christ. (See Gen. 15:6; Rom. 4;
    Gal. 3:6-14.) Yet Abraham obeyed God's laws. Sabbath observance was not
    a legalistic experience for him. It was a blessing because it was an act of
    faith in his Creator. (See The Great Controversy, p. 453.)
       The Israelites were reminded of the Sabbath before the giving of the Ten
    Commandments at Sinai. They were commanded to gather a double portion
    of manna on the sixth day in order to keep holy the seventh-day Sabbath.
    The period of slavery in Egypt had interrupted the practice of their religious
    observances. After the Exodus the Lord reintroduced the Sabbath. Note
    carefully the words "prove" and "law" in Exodus 16:4. They clearly indi-
    cate the existence of the law and the Sabbath as a test of loyalty before
    Sinai—"that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no"
    (Ex. 16:4).

         What statement of Paul establishes that the giving of the Ten
    46
Commandments at Sinai was not the introduction of a system of works
righteousness? Gal. 3:15-17.


   The covenant given to Abraham involved righteousness and salvation by
faith. In effect the Lord told Abraham, "You believe in the Messiah to
come, and I will give you forgiveness for the past, power for the present,
and the assurance of eternal life." Paul taught that the giving of the law at
Sinai did not disannul the covenant given to Abraham. The purpose of the
Ten Commandments was, not to introduce a system of works, but to point
out sins and encourage Israel's faith in the Messiah who would atone for
them (Gal. 3:19-24). The Sabbath, which is at the very heart of the Ten
Commandments, was not part of a works system. It was a vital part of a
righteousness by faith religion.
 What kind of Sabbath observance is stipulated by the fourth com-
mandment? Ex. 20:8-11.


   God gave Adam and Eve the Sabbath as a day when they could enter into
closer fellowship with Him and He with them. This highest level of compan-
ionship was the supreme purpose for the creation of humanity. We were
made not merely for animal and human fellowship, but for fellowship with
God, the Eternal Father of us all.
   The fourth commandment forever establishes that Creation week con-
sisted of seven 24-hour days. The Sabbath is not merely a symbol of rest.
Any day of the week could be used as a symbol of rest. The Sabbath is a sign
of a literal creation week—"for in six days the Lord made" (Ex. 20:11).
The fourth commandment gives a clear testimony as to why God com-
manded us to "remember the sabbath day." Those who honor the seventh-
day Sabbath have a bulwark against the error of the evolutionary theory,
which teaches that life has evolved over long periods of time.

  In the days when Israel was a theocracy, what did the Lord command
should be done to the Sabbath breaker? Ex. 31:14; Num. 15:30-36.


  The individual who broke the Sabbath "presumptuously," or "with a
high hand" (Num. 15:30, RSV), was to be cut off from Israel. Presumptu-
ous sins were those committed in a proud spirit of rebellion against the Lord.
(See Ex. 21:14, 15; Deut. 1:43; 17:12, 13; 18:22.)
  In their wilderness experience, Israel had been specifically commanded
by the Lord: "Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the
sabbath day" (Ex. 35:3).
  In direct rebellion against this command, a man gathered wood for a fire
on the Sabbath day. The Lord directed that he should be put to death.
  Seventh-day Adventists are sometimes reminded that they do not put to
death Sabbath breakers. This is said to be inconsistent because Adventists
observe the Sabbath of the fourth commandment. It should be pointed out
that the death penalty was to be meted out in Israel for rebellious breaking of
any divine commandment. (Compare Num. 15:30; Deut. 13:6-10; 21:18-21;
                                                                            47
        22:20-27.) No modern church puts to death members who are guilty of idol-
        atry, immorality, disobedience to parents, or other sins of rebellion against
        God.
           In view of Christ's glorious love made manifest at the cross, the New
        Testament makes willful disobedience extremely serious. The punishment is
        eternal loss. (See Heb. 10:26-31.)

TAU E   I11. CHRIST AND THE SABBATH.

             What did Jesus do on the Sabbath day? Luke 4:16.



          By what instruction did Jesus demonstrate His wish that His follow-
        ers should observe the Sabbath after His death and resurrection? Matt.
        24:20.


           When "the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet"
        is set up (Matt. 24:15), Jesus' people are to pray that their flight from their
        persecutors will not be on the Sabbath day. Jesus was referring to Dan. 8:13
        and 9:27. The little-horn power of Daniel 8 represents both pagan and papal
        Rome. It first set up the "abomination of desolation" (Matt. 24:15), or "the
        desolating sacrilege" (RSV) when the Roman armies threatened Jerusalem
        (A.D. 66-70). The context of Jesus' statement indicates that a second fulfill-
        ment came in the Middle Ages. (See Matt. 24:15-29.) Because Matthew
        chapter 24 is using historical events as a type of end-time events, we know
        that just prior to the Second Advent "the abomination of desolation" once
        more will become a threat to the religious liberty of the people of God.
           The instruction of Matthew 24:20 applies as much to the end of time as it
        does to the first century and the Middle Ages. Therefore, the Lord intends
        His people to observe the Sabbath right down to His second advent. (See
        The Desire of Ages, pp. 630, 631; The Great Controversy; pp. 26, 36, 37;
        Testimonies, vol 5, pp. 464, 465.)

        ing Jesus' method of Sabbath observance?

  • Mark 3:1-6

  • Mark 7:6-9

  • John 7:21-24

  • John 9:1-16

IV. THE APOSTLES AND THE SABBATH.
  What action of Christ's followers after His death establishes that the
seventh day of the week is the true Bible Sabbath? Luke 23:54-24:1, 7;
compare Mark 16:9; 1 Cor. 15:4.

  Jesus died and was buried on the day of "preparation" for the Sabbath.
The next day His followers rested "according to the commandment." Jesus
rose from the dead the following day, the "first day of the week."
   Paul indicates that Christ's resurrection day was "the third day." The
picture is clear. Jesus was crucified on Friday afternoon and rose on Sunday
morning. The day between was the "sabbath day according to the
commandment" (Luke 23:56). The true Bible Sabbath is the twenty-four
hour period from sundown Friday till sundown Saturday. (See also Lev.
23:32; Neh. 13:19; Mark 1:21, 32.)
   Creation Friday and crucifixion Friday were new beginnings for the hu-
man race. On the first, creation was completed; on the second, re-creation of
fallen humanity was assured. The Sabbath that followed Creation Friday
was a day of rest. How appropriate that Jesus should rest in the tomb after
crucifixion Friday. His sacrificial work was complete. Redemption was pro-
vided for all who would believe. The Sabbath is a memorial of both creation
and redemption.
SEARCH AND LEARN: How many Sabbaths observed by the Apostle
Paul are recorded in the book of Acts? What does this tell us about the
attitude of the apostolic Christian church to Sabbathkeeping?

  • Acts 13:14, 15, 42-44

  e Acts 16:12-15

  • Acts 17:1, 2

   • Acts 18:1, 4, 11
  These Sabbath meetings took place over a period of ten years, from about
A.D. 45 to 55. Why would Luke record all these Sabbath meetings of the
apostles and not say one word about any change of the Sabbath? Surely if
there had been any inspired counsel to worship on another day, or not to
worship on any day Luke would have mentioned it.
  Some Christians believe that Paul went to the synagogues on the Sabbath
                                                                           49
day only because he could find there an audience of Jews ready to listen to
the gospel. Undoubtedly Paul did use the synagogue as a ready-made evan-
gelistic center. But he kept the Sabbath whether he went to the synagogue or
not.
   In Philippi Paul and his associates kept the Sabbath "by a river side"
(Acts 16:13). They did not go there because it was a convenient place to
meet with Jews. It was a'place "where prayer was wont to be made." The
Greek may be translated: "where we thought (supposed, assumed) there
was a place of prayer."
   The apostles looked for a quiet place to pray on the Sabbath day. Because
they noticed other people nearby, they took the opportunity to present the
gospel to them. The story establishes that the apostles observed the Sabbath.
   The apostles honored the Sabbath because they understood its deep sig-
nificance. Hebrews 4, written less than forty years after the cross, compares
Israel with the church. (See Hebrews 4:4, 9.) Christians are urged to do what
Israel failed to do, to enter into the spiritual rest of which the seventh-day
Sabbath is the symbol and the means.

  When John was a prisoner on the island of Patmos, on what day of
the week did he receive a vision? Rev. 1:10; compare Mark 2:28.


   John received his vision during the last decade of the first century A.D. In
the second half of the second century some Christian writers used the Greek
word for "Lord's day" to mean the first day of the week. They did this
because Jesus rose.from the dead on the first day of the week. Certain mod-
ern scholars have, therefore, assumed that the Lord's• day on which John
received his vision must have been Sunday.
   Words.and phrases often change meaning over a period of time. It is not
valid reasoning to read back a later meaning of a word or phrase into an
earlier use of that word or phrase. John's understanding of the Lord's day
must be considered in the light of his background experiences. As one of the
twelve disciples, he had heard Jesus claim that He was "Lord" of the Sab-
bath. How natural it was for John to speak of the Sabbath as the Lord's day!

SEARCH AND LEARN: How would you deduce from the passages that
follow that God's last-day seal is given only to those who keep His Sab-
bath day holy?

     2. Rev. 14:1, 4, 5, 7

     3. Compare Rom. 4:11 with Ex. 31:13

     4. Heb. 8:10

ILLUMINATION: "The fourth commandment alone of all the ten con-
tains the seal of the great Lawgiver, the Creator of the heavens and the earth.
Those who obey this commandment take upon themselves His name, and all
the blessings it involves are theirs."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 350.

      FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Study the following passages
ill   of Scripture that are sometimes used against the teaching of the Seventh-day
      Sabbath. By placing these passages in their context and comparing scripture
      with scripture discover their true meaning: Acts 20:7; 1 Cor. 16:1, 2; Col.
      2:14-17; Rom. 14:4-8, 13. Compare Lev. 23; Num 28, 29.

      WHAT OTHERS TEACH: History reveals that in the early Christian cen-
      turies there was a gradual transference of Sabbathkeeping to Sunday obser-
      vance. Even so, in every century since the time of Christ there have been
      Christians who have faithfully observed the seventh-day Sabbath. For cen-
      turies Sundaykeeping was rigorously promoted by law and example. This
      rigid observance has been steadily eroding since the mid-nineteenth century.
      For all practical purposes, Sunday observance today is limited to church
      attendance. Orthodox Jews strictly observe the seventh-day Sabbath. Al-
      though several smaller Christian groups teach obedience to the fourth com-
      mandment, the Seventh-day Adventist Church is the largest denomination in
      the world that does so.

      HOW TO SHARE THIS TRUTH WITH OTHERS: If you are experi-
      encing the Sabbath as a day of delight your testimony to others will be conta-
      gious. Invite others to enjoy the Sabbath blessing by going to church with
      you. Show those with whom you are studying how the Sabbath focuses on
      the Lord's creative and redemptive power. Explain that the very heart of the
      Sabbath is resting in His love and work—not yours. Explain that when the
      evolutionary theory came into existence during the nineteenth century, God
      raised up the Advent movement to call people's attention to His creative
      work. (See Revelation 14, the three angels' messages.)

      SUMMARY: The Sabbath as understood by Seventh-day Adventists was
      established by Christ at Creation. It is, therefore, a Christian institution. The
      Sabbath was kept from Creation to Sinai. It was not intended only for Jews,
      but for humanity in general. Jesus and the apostles kept the Sabbath, and
      Jesus instructed His followers to observe it after His death. He taught that
      the Sabbath should be kept until His second advent. The book of Revelation
      presents Sabbath keeping as a vital aspect of the spiritual experience of those
      who receive the end-time seal of God.

God Tells Us About
Stewardship
SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "Whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the
 PM   Lord, apd not unto men; knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive
      the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ" (Col.
      3:23, 24).

CENTRAL TEACHING: "Stewardship. We are God's stewards, en-
trusted by Him with time and opportunities, abilities and possessions, and
the blessings of the earth and its resources. We are responsible to Him for
their proper use. We acknowledge God's ownership by faithful service to
Him and our fellow men, and by returning tithes and giving offerings for the
proclamation of His gospel and the support and growth of His church. Stew-
ardship is a privilege given to us by God for nurture in love and the victory
over selfishness and covetousness. The steward rejoices in the blessings that
come to others as a result of his faithfulness."—Fundamental Belief
No. 20.

INTRODUCTION: Seventeen years after the Babylonian captivity of the
Jews had ended by a decree issued by Cyrus that they could return to Jerusa-
lem and rebuild the house of God, the Jews were discouraged. Samaritan
opposition to the building of the Temple had become fierce. Some of the
Jews were wondering whether they had interpreted the 70-year prophecy
correctly—perhaps it was not time to rebuild yet. Yet it "was a time of
wonderful opportunity for the Jews. The highest agencies of heaven were
working on the hearts of kings [see Daniel 101, and it was for the people of
God to labor with the utmost activity to carry out the decree of Cyrus. . . .
But in the day of God's power many proved unwilling."—Prophets and
Kings, p. 572.
   When they neglected the work on the temple and turned instead to build-
ing their own homes, God challenged them: "Is it time for you yourselves to
be living in your paneled houses, while this house remains in ruins?" (Hag-
gai 1:4, NIV).
   Twice in the first chapter of Haggai God challenged the people to con-
sider their ways—to stop and take a look at what was happening because of
their neglect. "Ye have sown much, and bring in little. . . . he that earneth
52
wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes. . . . Ye looked for much,
and lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it"
(Haggai 1:6-9).
   Why? Because in a time of great urgency for the work of the Lord they
were caught up in a Laodicean sleeping sickness—even being unaware of
their neglect. What about us today as individuals and as a church? Are we so
caught up in our own priorities that we neglect God's?
   He challenges us to consider our ways. Nothing other than total commit-
ment to the Lord and His cause is worthy of these last moments of time.

I. STEWARDSHIP RECOGNIZES GOD'S OWNERSHIP.

   God has given us everything that love could provide. His most loving gift
is the power of choice. We alone decide how we will manage the gifts that
love has given. In order to do so we must recognize that all we have and are
comes from Him.

  What makes God owner of all that we have? Gen. 1:26-28; Col. 1:15-
17.



 In what pointed language does God describe His ownership of the
world? Psalm 50:10-12.



  What did David indicate about the ownership of all he and his people
had and about offerings to God? 1 Chron. 29:14.



ILLUMINATION: "Men whom God has blessed with His bounties clasp
their arms about their earthly treasure and make these bounties and bless-
ings, which God has graciously given them, a curse by filling their hearts
with selfishness and distrust of Him. They accept the goods lent them, yet
claim them as their own, forgetting that the Master has any claim upon
them, and refusing to yield to Him even the interest that He demands. . . .
"The earth is the Lord's, and all the treasure it contains. . . . He has en-
trusted His treasure to stewards, that with them they may advance His cause
and glorify His name."—Testimonies, vol. 2, p. 652.
   What God seeks in return for all that He has given us is total commitment
to Him. God's people in Hosea's day repudiated the Owner-manager con-
cept. They did not acknowledge that their material blessings came from the
Lord. (See Hosea 2:8.) The committed Christian will accept the fact that
God is the owner of everything and that His children are the managers of
these gifts. (see Matt. 6:25-34.) There is no reason to worry about material
things as long as we are faithful managers. True peace of mind is the fruitage
of understanding and practicing the principles of this Owner-manager rela-
tionship.
                                                                           53
n   IL STEWARDSHIP IS A TOTAL LIFE COMMITMENT.

      What does Paul term our commitment to God? Why is it
    "reasonable?" Rom. 12:1-3.



       In the fullest sense stewardship can be defined as the complete and unre-
    served giving of ourselves to Jesus Christ. Our responsibility to God and to
    our fellow human beings does not depend on the quantity or quality of our
    material possessions. Our stewardship is based on two facts brought out in
    the texts that follow. Study the texts, then list what the basis is for our stew-
    ardship:

         0 Isa. 44:24

         0 1 Cor. 6:20

      We cannot separate ourselves legitimately from God's plans for carrying
    out His work of salvation and restoration on earth. There is a sense in which
    He needs us. Most certainly we need the privilege of being used by Him.

         What basic principle is outlined in 1 Corinthians 10:31?



      What is the origin of true liberty? How do our gifts to God reveal our
    love for Him? 2 Cor. 8:1-5.



      If the church members in Macedonia had withheld their material and fi-
    nancial resources, that would have been proof that they had not previously
    given themselves fully to God.

      What attitudes characterized the Macedonian members when they
    gave to the glory of God?

       "The troubles they have been through have tried them hard, yet in all this
    they have been so
       (1) exuberantly happy that from the depth of their poverty they have
    shown themselves
       (2) lavishly open-handed.
       (3) Going to the limit of their resources, as I can testify, and even beyond
    that limit, they
       (4) begged us most insistently, and on their own initiative, to be allowed
    to share in this generous service to their fellow-Christians" (2 Cor. 8:2-4,
    NEB).
    ILLUMINATION: "Nearly all the Macedonian believers were poor in this
    world's goods, but their hearts were overflowing with love for God and His
    54
truth, and they gladly gave for the support of the gospel. When general
collections were taken up in the Gentile churches for the relief of the Jewish
believers, the liberality of the converts in Macedonia was held up as an
example to other churches. . . .
   "The willingness to sacrifice on the part of the Macedonian believers
came as a result of wholehearted consecration. . . . It was not necessary to
urge them to give; rather, they rejoiced in the privilege of denying them-
selves even of necessary things in order to supply the needs of others. When
the apostle would have restrained them, they importuned him to accept their
offering. In their simplicity and integrity, and in their love for their brethren,
they gladly denied self, and thus abounded in the fruit of benevolence."—
The Acts of the Apostles, pp. 343, 344.

  To whose example did Paul refer as being the motivating factor in the
sacrificial spirit of the Macedonians? 2 Cor 8:9.



  The basis of all stewardship is the life and death of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Stewardship is utter selflessness. It is giving oneself completely to God, as
well as giving service to one's fellow human beings. When we see the sim-
ple life that Jesus lived and the horrible death that He died, how can we
withhold that which He asks of us? Christ gave not merely what He had; He
gave Himself. This is stewardship of the highest order.

I11. STEWARDSHIP IS A PRIVILEGE.

  If we love the Lord with our entire heart, mind, soul, and strength we will
consider it a privilege to demonstrate our love in many practical ways that
honor and please Him.

   What sort of things are more important to God than our tithes and
offerings? Matt. 23:23.



   Stewardship of total life commitment consists of much more than finan-
cial giving. In fact, material gifts make up only a small part of what those
who choose to follow God are privileged to bring to Him. But what we do
with the means He has provided us becomes a good indication of whether we
are committed fully to Him.

ILLUSTRATION: If you place before you all your check stubs, cancelled
checks, charge accounts, and receipts, you see at a glance what the direction
of your life has been. As you survey all the material possessions of which
you have made use—clothes, lands, homes, cars, bank accounts, stock cer-
tificates, food consumed, expenditure on entertainment, plus the tithes and
offerings you have given—you can say, "There am I. That is the record of
my life." Then ask yourself the question "Have I neglected the more impor-
tant matters—justice, mercy, and faithfulness?"

                                                                                55
      SEARCH AND LEARN: Study the two contrasting stories that follow.
      In the space provided, indicate how they demonstrate the difference
      between total conunitment and halfhearted service:

           0 Acts 4:32-5:11—Ananias and Sapphira




           0 Mark 12:41-44 —The widow's mite




      THINK IT THROUGH: When Jesus said "Where your treasure is,
      there will your heart be also" (Matt. 6:21), did He mean that our hearts
      follow where we put our treasure or that our treasure follows where we
      put our hearts?

         One specific purpose for God's plan of stewardship is to develop greater
      faith and stronger Christian characters on our part. But we must not over-
      look the other side of the treasure/heart equation. Where our hearts are,
      there our treasures naturally will follow. Ananias and Sapphira held back
      part of their pledge because their hearts were not committed completely to
      Christ and they did not appreciate the tremendous privilege that was theirs in
      giving to Him and His cause. "It is only when Christian motives are fully
      acknowledged, and the conscience is awake to duty, when divine light
      makes impressions upon the heart and character, that selfishness is over-
      come, and the mind of Christ is exemplified. The Holy Spirit, working upon
      human hearts and characters, will expel all tendency to covetousness, to
      deceptive dealing. "—Counsels on Stewardship, p. 313.

WED   IV. STEWARDHIP BLESSES THE FAITHFUL STEWARD.
Ell
        What blessing does God pronounce upon the faithful steward? Matt.
      25:21.



         Not only do those who are faithful stewards reap what they have sown,
      they actually receive from the Master's hands much more than they deserve.
      (See John 10:10.)

        How abundant will be God's blessing as we return to Him tithes and
      offerings? Mal. 3:10-12.



      56
  What use is to be made of the tithe? Lev. 27:30; Num. 18:21; Deut.
12:5, 6; 1 Cor. 9:13, 14.


  See also Testimonies, vol. 9, pp. 247-250.

  What is the result of commitment to God's will and way? 2 Cor. 9:
6-8.


   Our giving demonstrates the extent and completeness of our commitment.
It embraces all areas of our lives. The result of such giving is that grace
abounds in and toward the giver. We reap what we sow.
   In 2 Corinthians 9:7, the Greek word for "cheerful" is hilaros from
which is derived our English word "hilarious." It is interesting to note how
solemn people's faces are when the offering plate passes by. There should
be an enthusiastic, contagious, joyfulness as we give to God not only our
funds but also our entire beings.

  How much of our means and of ourselves does God expect us to give?
Deut. 16:17.


   Individuals can only give as God enables them to give, whether it be time,
talents, money, or knowledge. Sharing the gospel is sharing what we are
able to share. Our spiritual experience and our relationship with God is what
we actually have to share. We use the "gifts" of life in the process of shar-
ing. Doing so not only blesses the recipients but benefits those who give. As
we learn to love by sharing, our characters are being molded in the image of
the great Giver.
   Financial gifts are needed urgently in the cause of God. However, a living
experience and a personal relationship with God are our most urgent needs.
Adequate funding is not and never has been the basic problem that has hin-
dered in the development of God's work through the centuries. The great
need has been the development of a truly spiritual experience in the recipi-
ents of God's gift of life.
   Time stewards of life understand by experience the joy of Jesus that is
expressed in Hebrews 12:2, "Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of
our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despis-
ing the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God."
Giving brings joy as we enter into full, complete, and happy partnership
with Jesus.

V. STEWARDSHIP BLESSES OTHERS.

   What is the significance of Christ's fifth beatitude in Matthew 5:7?


  More than the spirit of mercy or forgiveness is intended here. When
Christ dwells in our hearts fully, they overflow with His benevolence.
                                                                          57
     SEARCH AND LEARN: What can we learn from the examples of giv-
     ing in the early church that are recorded in the passages that follow?

          0 Rom. 15:26, 27

           1 Cor. 9:9-14

 g FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read Counsels on Steward-
ra
     ship, chapters 1-6, pp. 13-28, and chapters 65-68, pages 339-350.

     WHAT OTHERS TEACH: Few other denominations have a stewardship
     program that approximates that of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The
     Adventist plan for returning tithes and offerings follows the principles out-
     lined in Scripture. Some churches prefer modern money-raising techniques
     to collect the means they need. To persuade the people to give, they use
     television and pulpit appeals, blanket mailings, offering of prizes, bingo
     gambling, lotteries, begging, cajoling, and even threatening. Thank God for
     His spiritual plan of motivating the giver on the basis of love for the Lord,
     who sacrificed all for us.

     HOW TO SHARE THIS TRUTH WITH OTHERS: Your personal testi-
     mony of how God has blessed you mentally, physically, financially, and
     spiritually through a total life commitment stewardship program is the best
     way to help others understand this beautiful truth. Always present this sub-
     ject from the angle of-blessings received because of joyful obedience. For
     instance, on the question of tithing, show how nine tenths of a person's
     income goes much farther with God's blessing than ten tenths without it.
     Show the truth of this fact by using Haggai 1:5-11. Always remember to
     pray for the power of the Holy Spirit to guide in what you say as you share
     your faith.

     SUMMARY: Seventh-day Adventists understand stewardship as our re-
     sponse to receiving all that we have from God. Only God is self-existent.
     The fact that He created us means that we owe life itself to Him. He gave it
     and He maintains it. God has given us time in which to work for Him and
     others. He has given us bodies to care for so that we might be the greatest
     possible blessing to the world. He has given us money and material bless-
     ings for use in His service. As we consider God as the real owner of all these
     gifts and ourselves as His managers, we are moved to commit ourselves
     totally to Him. Stewardship then becomes a great blessing.

     —APPLICATION
        Have I experienced the peace that results from acknowledging God's
        ownership of all I possess?
        Do I see myself as the manager of God's gifts?
      o Do I trust God enough to surrender my time, talents, treasure, and
        body temple for His service and the blessing of my fellow human
        beings?

God Tens Us About
Christian Behavior
SAB    MEMORY TEXT: "The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to
1=4   kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that
       they might have it more abundantly" (John 10:10).

CENTRAL TEACHING: "Christian Behavior. We are called to be a
godly people who think, feel, and act in harmony with the principles of
heaven. For the Spirit to recreate in us the character of our Lord we involve
ourselves only in those things which will produce Christlike purity, health,
and joy in our lives. This means that our amusement and entertainment
should meet the highest standards of Christian taste and beauty. While rec-
ognizing cultural differences, our dress is to be simple, modest, and neat,
befitting those whose true beauty does not consist of outward adornment but
in the imperishable ornament of a gentle and quiet spirit. It also means that
because our bodies are the temples of the Holy Spirit, we are to care for
them intelligently. Along with adequate exercise and rest, we are to adopt
the most healthful diet possible and abstain from the unclean foods identi-
fied in the Scriptures. Since alcoholic beverages, tobacco, and the irrespon-
sible use of drugs and narcotics are harmful to our bodies, we are to abstain
from them as well. Instead, we are to engage in whatever brings our
thoughts and bodies into the discipline of Christ, who desires our whole-
someness, joy, and goodness."—Fundamental Belief No. 21.

OUTLINE:
   I. The More Abundant Life.
  11. The Christian's Health.
 I11. Dress and Adornment.
  IV. Entertainment That Christ Approves.
   V. The Life of Jesus Is Our Example.

INTRODUCTION: Several years ago an article appeared in a popular
evangelical magazine enumerating practices that seemed to erect a wall of
separation between Adventists and other Christians. Why does our church
advocate a life-style that includes healthful practices? Why do we advocate a
modest dress code and beneficial types of amusement and recreation? Are
we attempting to earn our way to heaven? Are we trying to be different for
the sake of difference? Or is Christian behavior related to the gospel?
   First, we must understand that the cross reveals the utter uselessness of
trying to earn merit through a particular life-style. The practice of high
standards related to Christian behavior cannot earn credit toward salvation.
Standards do not save; they demonstrate the saving presence of Christ in the
heart.
                                                                           59
   Second, trying to be different in the way we look, act, and think just for
the sake of being different from the world is irrational. There are reasons for
every standard that the church upholds. These reasons focus on Jesus, who
was different, not in order to be different—but to make a difference in the
lives of His followers. That difference is spelled out in John 10:10, our
memory text. Above everything else, Jesus desires for His followers the
more abundant life experience.
   A key point in the gospel is restoration. Gospel restoration effects us men-
tally, physically, spiritually, and socially. The committed Christian does not
ask, "Why is this or that wrong?" He asks, "What would my Lord have me
to do and why?" If this attitude means forsaking a cherished practice or
habit, the Christian knows it is for his or her best good. A person's relation-
ship with Christ is more important than anything in life.
   The Adventist Church does not provide detailed rules regarding conduct.
The church presents the basic principles of the Bible and asks church mem-
bers to live by them for their own good and for the honor and integrity of the
church—the body of Christ. The details are left to individual conscience
guided by the Holy Spirit.

I. THE MORE ABUNDANT LIFE.

  How did Moses set before Israel the more abundant life concept?
Deut. 30:11-16; 28:1, 2.



  Whose ownership are we urged to acknowledge? What is the basis of
this ownership? 1 Cor. 6:19, 20; 3:16, 17.


   We all know by experience that rules listed in an operation manual for
various types of equipment—automobiles, furnaces, microwaves, et
cetera—are designed to give the owner the best possible service. So with
life. God, the Owner and Proprietor, desires our best good. He alone knows
what will provide us the maximum amount of happiness. Why do some
people rebel against standards of dress, diet, and recreation? (See Rom. 8:
6-8.)
ILLUMINATION: "To set the mind on the things of the Spirit, and to have
the thoughts and desires governed solely by the Spirit of God, result in that
healthful, life-giving harmony of all the functions of the soul that is a sure
pledge and foretaste of the life to come."—SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 6,
p. 563. (See also Eph. 1:13, 14.) The presence of the Holy Spirit brings
love, joy, and peace into the life. (See Gal. 5:22.) The Spirit within is the
kingdom of God within. The trusting Christian enjoys "righteousness, and
peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost" (Rom. 14:17).

  What has Christ done for us that gives Him the right to direct our
way of life? Col. 1:14, 16, 17; 1 Peter 1:15-19; Titus 2:14.


60
ILLUMINATION: "My heart aches as I am shown how many there are
who make self their idol. Christ has paid the redemption price for them. To
Him belongs the service of all their powers. But their hearts are filled with
self-love, and the desire for self-adorning. They give no thought to the
words, 'Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up
his cross, and follow me' (Mark 8:34). Self-gratification is hiding Christ
from their view. They have no desire to walk before God in meekness and
lowliness. They are not looking to Jesus. They are not praying that they may
be changed into His likeness."—Selected Messages, vol. 1, p. 80.

SEARCH AND LEARN: What do the following passages indicate re-
garding the level of consecration that the Lord seeks of us?

  o Rom. 121

  o 1 Thess. 5:23

  o 1 Cor. 10:31

11. THE CHRISTIAN'S HEALTH.

  Because God cares for us, he has given us information for the mainte-
nance of our bodies. In Scripture there are more than one thousand texts that
deal with a person's physical health. In addition, God has graciously given
us specific details as to the best way to care for our bodies. Books such as
The Ministry of Healing, Counsels on Health, and Counsels on Diets and
Foods are indispensable to those who really seek to know God's will in these
matters.
SEARCH AND LEARN: God has not left us in doubt about how He
wants us to treat our bodies. What specific instruction do you find in the
following passages?

  • Gen. 1:29, 30; 3:18

  • Isa. 65:3, 4; 66:15-17

  • Prov. 20:1; 23:29-32

  o Lev. 11:1-20

   Health is not merely the absence of a disease. Health is not a product, but
a process. A seemingly healthy person who is violating one of nature's laws
is not really healthy. Sooner or later disease will develop. A truly healthy
condition is found only in those who, by the grace of God, faithfully, cheer-
fully, and consistently practice all the laws of health.

ILLUMINATION: "Pure air, sunlight, abstemiousness, rest, exercise,
proper diet, the use of water, trust in divine power—these are the true reme-
dies. Every person should have a knowledge of nature's remedial agencies
and how to apply them. It is essential both to understand the principles in
                                                                           61
volved in the treatment of the sick and to have a practical training that will
enable one rightly to use this knowledge."—The Ministry of Healing, p.
127.

  There are many nonsmokers who do not get proper exercise. God wants
us to be balanced. Many who would never think of smoking or drinking
alcohol are grossly overweight because they eat enormous quantities of
food. They are violating the laws of health, driving away the Holy Spirit,
and sowing seeds of future illness. The original diet given man by God
consisted of vegetables, fruits, nuts, and grains. (See Gen. 1:29.) Our first
parents were vegetarians. Such a diet contains all the nutrients necessary for
health.

THINK IT THROUGH: Why does the Seventh-day Adventist Church
recommend a vegetarian diet to its members? What are the disadvan-
tages of a flesh food diet?

ILLUMINATION: "There needs to be presented to all students and physi-
cians, and by them to others, that the whole animal creation is more or less
diseased. Diseased meat is not rare, but common. Every phase of disease is
brought into the human system through subsisting upon the flesh of dead
animals. The feebleness and weakness in consequence of a change from a
meat diet will soon be overcome, and physicians ought to understand that
they should not make the stimulus of meat eating essential for health and
strength. All who leave it alone intelligently, after becoming accustomed to
the change, will have health of sinews and muscles."—Counsels on Diet
and Foods, p. 292.
   The cholesterol content of flesh foods is very high. Cholesterol is one of
the main causes of arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) that produces
heart disease.

THINK IT THROUGH: Why is the use of alcohol, tobacco, and the
misuse of other drugs ruled out for the Christian?

   1. Alcohol causes loss of mental and physical control. It is one of the
main causes of tragedy on the highways in most countries on earth today. It
is estimated that more than 10 percent of all admissions to public mental
institutions are the result of chronic alcoholism. Alcohol damages the high-
est centers of the brain; those concerned with behavior, speech, and mem-
ory. Concentrated doses damage the nervous system.
   2. The dangers of smoking to health have been heavily documented in
recent years. Lung cancer, pulmonary emphysema, and heart disease are
very common among smokers. As early as 1875 Ellen G. White wrote:
"Tobacco is a slow, insidious poison, and its effects are more difficult to
cleanse from the system than those of liquor."—Temperance, p. 55.
   3. Misuse of drugs is condemned in the Bible. The "sorcerers" (Rev.
21:8; 22:15; Greek pharmakoi) are "mixers of poisons," or "poisoners."
Such people in ancient times were often involved in occult practices. At the
coming of Jesus people who misuse drugs will be classed among murderers,
adulterers, and idolaters. Not only the more potent drugs but also those
contained in tea and coffee are harmful to health.
62
         What does trust in God do for our health? Psalm 42:11.



       ILLUMINATION: "When temptations assail you, when care, perplexity,
       and darkness seem to surround your soul, look to the place you last saw the
       light. Rest in Christ's love and under His protecting care. When sin
       struggles for mastery in the heart, when guilt oppresses the soul and burdens
       the conscience, when unbelief clouds the mind, remember that Christ's
       grace is sufficient to subdue sin and banish the darkness. . . . Nothing tends
       more to promote health of body and of soul than does the spirit of gratitude
       and praise. It is a positive duty to resist melancholy, discontented thoughts
       and feelings—as much a duty as it is to pray."—The Ministry of Healing,
       pp. 250, 251.

6.11   I11. DRESS AND ADORNMENT.

       SEEK AND FIND: What principles designed to direct the way we dress
       are spelled out in the Bible?

         • 2 Cor. 3:18

         • 1 Tim. 2:9, 10

         • 1 Peter 3:3-5

           God wants the character of each believer "to be conformed to the image
       of his Son" (Rom. 8:29). The Holy Spirit brings the Christian progressively
       nearer to the image of Christ (2 Cor. 3:18). If Christ is living out His life
       through the individual (Gal. 2:20), then the pattern of dress and conduct that
       Christ respects will be followed.
           What is that pattern? Although women are mentioned in Scripture when
       dress is being discussed, the counsel is equally applicable to men. The
       modes of dress that the Bible condemns are: (1) braided hair; (2) wearing of
       gold; (3) wearing of pearls; (4) costly attire. (See 1 Tim. 2:9, 10.) In con-
       text, it is obvious that Paul is referring to extravagant hairdos and clothes.
       Obviously having hair disorderly and unkempt is just as likely to attract
       attention to oneself and so to break the Bible principle.
           The mode of dress that the inspired the apostle Paul approves will be: (1)
       respectable; (2) modest; (3) moderate, showing good judgment and self-
       control; (4) such as reveals reverence for God; (5) such as demonstrates a
       pure, humble heart.
           The secret of dressing properly is found in Philippians 2:5 and Hebrews
       12:2. If we have the mind of Christ, focusing our eyes on Him rather than on
       self, then the dress, makeup, jewelry problem will certainly disappear. The
       Scriptures distinguish clearly between the fashions of the world and those
        that honor God. (See Rev. 12:1; 17:4, 5.) The description of the woman who
       represents the true church includes modesty, purity, and beauty. By con-
        trast, the woman representing Babylon is extravagantly adorned. Those who
        have a relationship with Christ can easily detect the difference.
                                                                                   63
WED   IV. ENTERTAINMENT THAT CHRIST APPROVES.
Mil
        How important are our thoughts in God's sight? 2 Cor. 10:4, 5; Phil.
      4:8.



        What effect do our thoughts have on our words and actions? Prov.
      23:7; 15:26; 24:8, 9.



        What will the believer do when he sees evil? What promise is given to
      such a person? Isa. 33:15-17.



      THINK IT THROUGH: How would you apply the above principles to
      such forms of enjoyment as television watching, movie and theater go-
      ing, dancing, and gambling? (See also 1 Tim. 6:6-11; Prov. 28:20; Jer.
      17:10, 11; Matt. 6:19-24; 1 John 2:15-17; Col. 3:1- 3.)

         A person's control center is his mind. Our mind receptors must be kept
      keen and clean. The major purpose for the Christian health program is to
      keep the mind alert to the wiles of Satan and strong to resist him. The mind
      is to be the dwelling place of the Spirit of Christ.
         The nondrug-taking, nonalcohol-drinking, nonsmoking vegetarian who
      exercises and rests well is just as vulnerable as those who do not follow his
      life-style if his television viewing is out of control. Television is one of
      Satan's most deadly weapons against Christians today. Moral and ethical
      values are progressively broken down by indiscriminate watching of pro-
      grams filled with violence, immorality, and dishonesty.

Tip   V. THE LIFE OF JESUS IS OUR EXAMPLE.

        What kind of person was Jesus? To what extent did personal pride
      and covetousness motivate His behavior? Matt. 11:29; Phil. 2:5-8.



           How can we be like Jesus? 2 Peter 1:3, 4; Rom. 16:25; 1 Peter 2:21.



         There was no pride, impurity, or covetousness in Jesus. Riches meant
      nothing to Him. Personal adornment, dancing, unholy entertainment, gam-
      bling, and unhealthful practices were totally excluded from His life. The
      devil could not overcome Him with these or any other temptations. Christ
      was possessed by one all-consuming purpose, the salvation of lost human-
      ity. And He invites us to join Him in this great task.
      64
ILLUMINATION: "Christians must be like Christ. They should have the
same spirit, exert the same influence, and have the same moral excellence
that He possessed. The idolatrous and corrupt in heart must repent and turn
to God. Those who are proud and self-righteous must abase self and become
penitent and meek and lowly in heart. The worldly-minded must have the
tendrils of the heart removed from the rubbish of the world, around which
they are clinging, and entwined about God; they must become spiritually
minded."—Testimonies, vol. 5, pp. 249, 250.

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read Counsels on Health,
pages 19-25; Testimonies, vol. 4, pages 628-648, 652, 653.

WHAT OTHERS TEACH: A few score years ago many Protestant
churches had standards regarding diet and drink similar to those of Seventh-
day Adventists today. Gradually their standards have slipped. Some de-
nominations have a partial message of health reform. God has greatly
blessed Adventists in giving them a total life concept. Because others are
now moving toward this view of life, we have an excellent opportunity for
witnessing.

HOW TO SHARE THIS TRUTH WITH OTHERS: Healthful living is
easier to share than almost any other doctrine. Health is one of the most
popular topics of conversation, especially among adults. Giving to our
neighbors our health journal Vibrant Life is a fine way to strike up a friend-
ship. Sharing a loaf of fresh-baked bread or inviting friends to eat in your
home gives opportunity to share health concepts. After friendships are
formed, other doctrines can gradually be introduced. Your new friends can
then be invited to attend a worship service. When people see the validity of
our health principles our other doctrines have greater credence.

SUMMARY: Seventh-day Adventists are convinced that the power of the
indwelling Christ enables the believer to live in harmony with Bible princi-
ples in regard to health, dress, and entertainment. Correct behavior does not
earn our salvation; it is the result of the saving power of Jesus in the heart of
every committed Christian. While evil practices are excluded from the life,
the habits and practices that our Lord respects are fostered and cherished.

— APPLICATION
  • Do I believe that, by Jesus' grace, it is possible for me to be a reflec-
    tor of His character?
  • Am I willing to turn away from everything that Christ rejects, and
    accept the manner of life that His Word teaches to be right?
  • Am I committed to tactfully helping others draw nearer to Jesus in
    their manner of life?

Hap y homes
SAB
       MEMORY TEXT: "My little children, let us not love in word,
 PM    neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth" (1 John 3:18).

CENTRAL TEACHING: "Marriage was divinely established in Eden
and affirmed by Jesus to be a lifelong union between a man and a woman in
loving companionship. For the Christian a marriage commitment is to God
as well as to the spouse, and should be entered into only between partners
who share a common faith. Mutual love, honor, respect, and responsibility
are the fabric of this relationship, which is to reflect the love, sanctity, close-
ness, and permanence of the relationship between Christ and His church.
Regarding divorce, Jesus taught that the person who divorces a spouse, ex-
cept for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery. Although some
family relationships may fall short of the ideal, marriage partners who fully
commit themselves to each other in Christ may achieve loving unity through
the guidance of the Spirit and the nurture of the church. God blesses the
family and intends that its members shall assist each other toward complete
maturity. Parents are to bring their children to love and obey the Lord. By
their example and their words they are to teach them that Christ is a loving
disciplinarian, ever tender and caring, who wants them to become members
of His body, the family of God. Increasing family closeness is one of the
earmarks of the final gospel message. "— Fundamental Belief, No. 22.

INTRODUCTION: Aspirin does not cure headaches. It merely treats the
symptoms. The person who is sick may no longer feel the headache, but the
cause still is there. A tragically large number of homes and families are
unhappy ones. For that reason, much literature has been produced that is
intended to help improve family relationships. But most of this literature
treats the symptoms rather than the disease. We will not find long-lasting
cures for home problems until we get down to the basic cause of all such
problems—selfishness and sin. Only the Great Physician has the miracle
cure for human unhappiness. Happy homes depend on Christ dwelling in
our hearts and homes.
   We begin this lesson with the happy family rather than the institution of
marriage, because the principles shared in this lesson have a broad applica-
66
Lion. All of us, whether married or single, are members of a family of one
kind or another. All of us need Christ's help in order to improve our relation-
ships. Unhappy homes, marital difficulties, the so-called generation gap,
rebellious children, child abuse, family violence, bigotry, and hate are uni-
versal problems that are rooted in our sinful, human nature. They have only
one cure—the power of Christ to overcome evil in us and to help mend
fragmented relationships. In Christ also we can find relief from such related
problems as loneliness, stress, anger, and insensitivity.
   A happy, healthy, well-functioning family provides in turn a climate that
fosters,a better relationship with our Lord and a stronger witness to the com-
munity around us. Failure in family living and the inability to live up to our
expectations is the source of much guilt. In this lesson, let us focus upon
ways to bring the good news of the gospel to bear on the many facets of life
in our homes.

I. HOW TO HAVE A HAPPY FAMILY.
   As the "Prince of Peace" (Isa. 9:6), Jesus brings peace to,all who commit
themselves to Him. Jesus never needlessly wounded anyone. The Lord
looked upon His disciples and followers as His family. (See Matt. 12:50;
John 15:15.) Notice how carefully He treated Judas and tried to win His
affection. Yet in John 13:1 we read that Jesus, "having loved his own which
were in the world, he loved them unto the end."
   When we follow His example the peace He promised His disciples in
John 14:27 will characterize our relationships and make them happy ones.
  Notice specifically the counsel the apostle gives husbands and wives in
1 Peter 3:7. What does Peter set forth as the ideal in Christian relation-
ships? Verses 8-11.


ILLUMINATION: "Too may cares and burdens are brought into our fam-
ilies, and too little of natural simplicity and peace and happiness is cher-
ished. There should be less care for what the outside world will say and
more thoughtful attention to members of the family circle. There should be
less display and affectation of worldly politeness, and much more tender-
ness and love, cheerfulness and Christian courtesy, among the members of
the household. Many need to learn how to make home attractive, a place of
enjoyment. Thankful hearts and kind looks are more valuable than wealth or
luxury, and contentment with simple things will make home happy if love
be there."—The Adventist Home, p. 108.

   How broadly can the fifth commandment be applied to family and
 home life? What does the word honor mean? Ex. 20:12.


   In what way are we responsible for the happiness and well-being of
 other members of our church family? James 1:27.



                                                                            67
   In the same way that the spokes of the wheel come closer to one another
as they approach the hub, our church and family relationships will come
closer together as we come closer to Christ as the center of our lives.

11. MARRIAGE ESTABLISHED BY GOD.

   When God brought the animals to Adam for naming, Adam soon discov-
ered that they came in pairs, yet he was alone. Because of Adam's need for
companionship, God created Eve. (See Gen. 2:18.) When Adam saw her,
he recognized that she would meet his needs and he felt a deep responsibility
to meet hers. The first marriage, celebrated by God in Eden, was to be a
model for marriages in succeeding generations.

  How did Christ honor the institution of marriage when He lived on
earth? John 2:1-11.


  Jesus "gave no license to dissipation, and no shadow of worldly levity
marred His conduct; yet He found pleasure in scenes of innocent happiness,
and by His presence sanctioned the social gathering. A Jewish marriage was
an impressive occasion, and its joy was not displeasing to the Son of man.
By attending this feast, Jesus honored marriage as a divine institution."—
The Desire of Ages, p. 151.

THINK IT THROUGH: In the light of the significance of the new wine
as the presentation of the gospel in Mark 2:22, how does this new wine
symbol relate to the place of the gospel in the marriage relationship?

ILLUMINATION: "Like every other one of God's good gifts entrusted to
the keeping of humanity, marriage has been perverted by sin; but it is the
purpose of the gospel to restore its purity and beauty. "—Thoughts From the
Mount of Blessing, p. 64.
  What restriction did God place on marriage in order to preserve the
sanctity of the home? 2 Cor. 6:14.



  How did God's plan provide for equality in husband-wife relation-
ship while maintaining leadership and responsibility? Eph. 5:21-33.



   In Ephesians 5 we find the husband-wife relationship being compared to
that of Christ to His church, which places marriage on a solid, Christ-cen-
tered foundation. When we understand fully what this chapter is saying we
discover a concept of marriage that seems to be largely lost in our time. If
Paul's counsel were heeded divorce virtually would be eliminated. Even
young Christian couples who have the best intentions in the world often
view marriage as a private transaction between themselves. Their center of
focus is on the great love they have for each other.
68
  However, if marriage is to be successful it must focus on another—Jesus.
This most intimate of personal relationships proclaims to its participants the
mystery of the gospel. It involves a love that is greater than all human
love—a love that could not be understood until the Son of God gave His life
for us on the cross.

I11. A LIFELONG UNION.

   When Paul compares the husband-wife relationship to that of Christ and
the church, he establishes a model that indicates that the relationship is to
last for the rest of the partners' lives. The peace and joy of heaven enables
those united in Christ to weather the storms and trials of life. They develop a
love that is evident to all. It does not need to be advertised. God's covenant
love knits together what sin separates. (See Col. 2:2.) The everlasting cov-
enant, with the cross of Christ at its center, helps bind men and women
closer to each other in the marriage union. Even when spouses become
alienated the cross of Christ can break down the hostility that the enemy has
built up. (See Eph. 2:13, 14.)

ILLUSTRATION: Children can sense whether mother and father love each
other. While one father was on a temporary assignment in an area far from
home, he and his family lived in a small hotel room. Owing to lack of play
space in the room, his little girl was playing "house" in the hotel lobby.
One of the other guests in the hotel said to the little girl, "It's a shame that
you don't have a home of your own to play in." Quick as a wink the girl
responded, "Oh, we do have a home. We just don't have a house to put it in
here." She recognized the love that made a home out of a small hotel room.

SEARCH AND LEARN: Carefully study the passages that follow, then
write a statement that summarizes Christ's position on divorce:
  • Matt. 5:31, 32.
  • Matt. 19:3-9.
  • Luke 16:18.




  What are people to do who do not have Bible grounds for divorce, yet
do divorce? 1 Cor. 7:10, 11.



  Granted there are home and family situations that are far from the ideal
that make this question one for which there are no simple answers. Yet
consider the spiritual implications of divorce. It is the severing of relation-
ships between persons whom God has joined together. It involves breaking
not only vows made to another person but vows made to God. It undoes
what He has done. Paul's burden seems to be that everything should be done
that can be done to hold a marriage together.
                                                                              69
      THINK IT THROUGH: How can the forgiveness of God become a mo-
      tivating factor in my life and family relationships? How can it help me
      forgive myself as well as others? What can we do as church members to
      help others deal with the guilt, anger, fear, and grief that arises from
      difficult marriage relationships?

66)   IV. PARENTS AND CHILDREN.

        Parents assume a solemn responsibility when they have children. Chil-
      dren do not ask to be born, nor do they deserve the disruption that divorce
      forces on them. The parents' first responsibility to the children is to live
      consecrated Christian lives before them. Children often are confused by par-
      ents who do not live the principles that they teach.

           What specific role is delegated to fathers in Ephesians 6:4?


         The Bible places the duty of teaching and disciplining on fathers. Deuter-
      onomy 6:1-9 pictures the father training the children to know and understand
      the commandments of God. The father is to serve as the priest of the home.
      In the absence of a Christian father this responsibility falls upon the mother.

      ILLUMINATION: "All members of the family center in the father. He is
      the lawmaker, illustrating in his own manly bearing the sterner virtues: en-
      ergy, integrity, honesty, patience, courage, diligence, and practical useful-
      ness. The father is in one sense the priest of the household, laying upon the
      altar of God the morning and evening sacrifice. . . . Morning and evening
      the father, as priest of the household, should confess to God the sins com-
      mitted by himself and his children through the day."— The Adventist
      Home, p. 212.

        What qualities characterize a mother whose husband and children
      call her "blessed?" Prov. 31:10-28.


         "The tenderest earthly tie is that between the mother and her child. The
      child is more readily impressed by the life and example of the mother than
      by that of the father, for a stronger and more tender bond of union unites
      them.
         "The thoughts and feelings of the mother will have a powerful influence
      upon the legacy she gives her child. . .
         "A Christian mother will ever be wide awake to discern the dangers that
      surround her children. She will keep her own soul in a pure, holy atmo-
      sphere; she will regulate her temper and principles by the word of God and
      will faithfully do her duty, living above the petty temptations which will
      always assail her."—The Adventist Home, pp. 240, 241.
         As difficult as child rearing can be at times, children have a charm that is
      all their own. They possess a capacity to initiate and reciprocate love and
      trust. We must appreciate the preciousness of this gift with which the Lord
      blesses parents.
      70
  What is the responsibility of children toward their parents? Ex.
20:12; Eph. 6:1-3.



   As parents and children open their hearts to the influences of the Holy
Spirit, harmony and love will prevail in the home. This increasing closeness
to one another and to God will testify to the power of the final gospel mes-
sage to create the kind of unity for which Christ prayed (Mal. 4:5, 6; John
17:23).

THINK IT THROUGH: In the light of James 1:27, in what practical
ways should church members respond to the needs of single parents and
their children?

V. INCREASING FAMILY CLOSENESS.

  Happiness is not an end in itself. It is the product of Christlike, other-
centered living. The family that prays and plays together stays together.
"Hearts that are filled with the love of Christ can never get very far
apart."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 335. Families that attend church together
and work together for others find joy and happiness in such association.

SEARCH AND LEARN: What keys to successful family relationships
are found in the passages that follow?

  • Matt. 5:44

  • Matt. 7:1-5

  • Rom. 12:10

  • Eph. 4:32

ILLUMINATION: "As life with its burden of perplexity and care meets
the newly wedded pair, the romance with which imagination so often invests
marriage disappears. Husband and wife learn each other's character as it
was impossible to learn it in their previous association. This is a most critical
period in their experience. The happiness and usefulness of their whole fu-
ture life depend upon their taking a right course now. Often they discern in
each other unsuspected weaknesses and defects; but the hearts that love has
united will discern excellencies also heretofore unknown. Let all seek to
discover the excellencies rather than the defects. Often it is our own attitude,
the atmosphere that surrounds ourselves, which determines what will be
revealed to us in another."—The Ministry of Healing, p. 360.
   If you strike a single key on the piano the sound you get is not harmony.
In order to get harmony you must have at least one other note. It may be one
close by or one at some distance, but if it is a harmonious note it will blend
until the two sound like one but produce a more beautiful tone than either
would if struck separately or if one were played twice as loud.
                                                                              71-
THINK IT THROUGH: What benefits come to the family through the
practice of regular family worship? What can I do to help family wor-
ship deepen the individual spiritual experience of my family?
FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Study as much as you can of
the section on the home found in The Ministry of Healing, pages 349-395.

WHAT OTHERS TEACH: The Roman Catholic Church constitutes the
world's largest Christian organization. It takes a strong stand against divorce
for any reason. The Catholic Church does not recognize the one exception
that Jesus made, adultery, as grounds for a divorce. On the other extreme,
divorce for any and all reasons is allowed by many Protestant churches.

HOW TO SHARE THIS TRUTH WITH OTHERS: The first require-
ment in sharing our understanding of truth with others is daily to ask the
Lord for a fitness to meet people in a redemptive way. One of the finest
ways to share this doctrine is to invite a neighboring family to enjoy an
evening worship with your family. If possible sing several hymns, ask the
children to participate in reading passages of Scripture, share a Bible story
or two, then have prayer together. Make your guests feel welcome and com-
fortable. Be sensitive as to whether they are willing to participate in the
worship or not. As you get to know people through this method, invite them
to church and watch for opportunities to have Bible studies together. The
same principle can apply to those who are single or who live alone. One
person can invite a family over to enjoy a worship experience of this kind.

SUMMARY: Malachi 4:6 has special application to God's remnant people
in the end time. A Christian home, where the love of Christ reigns supreme,
is a powerful witness to the effectiveness of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Con-
secrated families form the backbone of the church. Satan's special object of
attack is to destroy the marriage relationship and to alienate love and respect
on the part of husbands and wives, children and parents. We live in fearful
times, but we have the sacred opportunity of taking the time and effort to
make our marriages work and to have a model home. Both the seventh-day
Sabbath and marriage were established by God in Eden and were designed
to be a permanent fixture. Christ did not divorce His unfaithful bride, the
church, but died for it. In the same way husbands and wives should demon-
strate tender love and faithfulness for one another.
     APPLICATION
     o Do I realize that a happy marriage relationship and home do not
       come by accident, but are a result of specific planning and working
       the plan?
     o If I am single and have plans for marriage or am thinking of mar-
       riage, am I making a deliberate effort to assure that my plans are
       approved by God?
     o If there is a problem in my marriage relationship, am I doing every-
       thing possible through my own commitment to Christ to bring about
       healing?
     o In what way has Christ's presence brought happiness and joy to my
       family?

God Trellis Us About
Christ's Heaven[ly
Ministry
SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "And the times of this ignorance God winked
PM    at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent: because
      he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in
      righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he
      hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him
      from the dead" (Acts 17:30, 31).

CENTRAL TEACHING: "Christ's Ministry in the Heavenly Sanctu-
ary. There is a sanctuary in heaven, the true tabernacle which the Lord set
up and not man. In it Christ ministers on our behalf, making available to
believers the benefits of His atoning sacrifice offered once for all on the
cross. He was inaugurated as our great High Priest and began His interces-
sory ministry at the time of His ascension. In 1844, at the end of the pro-
phetic period of 2300 days, He entered the second and last phase of His
atoning ministry. It is a work of investigative judgment which is part of the
ultimate disposition of all sin, typified by the cleansing of the ancient He-
brew sanctuary on the Day of Atonement. In that typical service the sanctu-
ary was cleansed with the blood of animal sacrifices, but the heavenly things
are purified with the perfect sacrifice of the blood of Jesus. The investigative
judgment reveals to heavenly intelligences who among the dead are asleep
in Christ and therefore, in Him, are deemed worthy to have part in the first
resurrection. It also makes manifest who among the living are abiding in
Christ, keeping the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus, and in
Him, therefore, are ready for translation into His everlasting kingdom. This
judgment vindicates the justice of God in saving those who believe in Jesus.
It declares that those who have remained loyal to God shall receive the king-
dom. The completion of this ministry of Christ will mark the close of human
probation before the Second Advent. "—Fundamental Belief No. 23.

  IV. The Time of the Judgment.


INTRODUCTION: The ancient Israelite sanctuary was designed by God to
explain the sacrifice, heavenly mediation, and judgment ministry of the
Lord Jesus Christ. The sacrifices offered in the sanctuary court pointed for-
                                                                             73
ward to the cross. The priestly work in the Holy Place represented Christ's
intercessory ministry after His resurrection. The-High Priest's work in the
Most Holy Place symbolized Christ's final ministry of vindication -in the
pre-advent, investigative judgment.

   Why is there need for an end-time, pre-advent judgment? God sees the
end from the beginning: Why should He convene a court session in heaven
to decide who should be saved and who lost?
   God is not concerned only with His own attitudes and reactions. He is
concerned that all the inhabitants of the unfallen'universe should be thor-
oughly convinced that the people He takes to heaven at the second coming of
Jesus have a right to be there. And God wants the unfallen angels to under--
stand without any doubt at all that every person whom He judges-to be un-
worthy of heaven is justly condemned to eternal death.
   The only way to confirm the belief of the unfallen universe in His com-
plete justice is to allow them to look into the records of people's lives, so
that they can know for themselves who have genuinely believed in Jesus and
who have not.
   There is another equally important point. God wants His people to have
victory over sin. He cannot take to heaven people who refuse to receive the
Holy Spirit as the power to overcome sin. There is a special sealing work to
be done before our Lord returns. Associated with that work there will be a
mighty outpouring of the Holy Spirit (the "latter rain") as the end draws
near. The heavenly judgment now in session is an on-going scrutiny of
people's lives, so that the universe can know who is growing in Christ- and
who is refusing to grow. Our Lord promises to give us unlimited power to
serve Him and overcome all evil. The pre-advent judgment decides who is
availing himself of that power, -and who is not.
   The pre-advent judgment is intended by God to be a great incentive for
last-day people to turn to Christ and receive His Spirit into their hearts. Their-
innocence in Christ will make it possible for the heavenly court to decide
that their names should be kept in the book of life for eternity.

I. THE ANCIENT ISRAELITE SANCTUARY.

   When the children of Israel were traveling from Egypt to the promised
land, Moses was commanded by the Lord to build a sanctuary that would be
His dwelling place, as well as a place of worship for the people. (See Ex.
25:8.) This sanctuary was not the same as a modern church. It consisted of a
courtyard in which was a tent or tabernacle. The tent contained two rooms,
one twice the size of the other.

  Describe the two items of furniture in the court of the sanctuary. Ex.
27:1-8; 30:17-21.



     Briefly describe the contents of the holy place. Ex. 25:23-32; 30:1-8.

  Describe the contents of theinost holy place. Ex. 25:10-21.


   The two items of furniture in the court were the altar of burnt offering and
the laver.
   The Holy Place contained a candlestick with seven branches (menorah),
the table of shewbread, and the altar of incense.
   In the Most Holy Place was the ark of the covenant, a relatively small box
containing the tables of stone, on which were written the Ten Command-
ments. The ark was a symbol of the throne of God. The presence of the Lord
was manifested above the mercy seat. (See Num. 7:89; 1 Sam. 4:4; 2 Kings
19:15.)

   The court was the place for animal sacrifices; the Holy Place represented
priestly intercession or mediation; the Most Holy Place was the dwelling
place of God where each Day of Atonement (tenth day of the seventh month)
the judgment took place. Sacrifice, mediation, and judgment are the three
great ministries provided by Jesus Christ to save the believing worshiper.

11. CHRIST THE DEITY, THE SACRIFICE, AND THE HIGH
    PRIEST.

  Who accompanied Israel in their travels, dwelling upon the throne in
the Most Holy Place of the sanctuary? 1 Cor. 10:1-4; Ex. 40:33-38.



  The Greek word translated "followed" in 1 Cor. 10:4 may also mean
"accompanied. " Christ accompanied Israel in their wilderness travels.
                                                                              75
ILLUMINATION: "Christ was their instructor. As He had been with them
in the wilderness, so He was still to be their teacher and guide. In the taber-
nacle and the temple His glory dwelt in the holy Shekinah above the mercy
seat. In their behalf He constantly manifested the riches of His love and
patience."—Christ's Object Lessons, p. 288. (See also Prophets and Kings,
p. 18 and Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 221.)

  Whose sacrifice was represented by every animal sacrifice offered in
the court of the sanctuary? John 1:29; Heb. 10:1-12.



  What was symbolized by the daily ministry of the priests in the court
and the Holy Place? Heb. 4:14-16; 7:23-28; 8:1, 2; 9:11-14.



   Atonement for sin was provided the repenting Israelite when: (1) he con-
fessed his sin over the head of a sacrifice (Lev. 4:29 first part); (2) he took
the life of the animal (Lev. 4:29 last part); (3) the priest sprinkled the blood
either on the horns of the altar of burnt offering (for the ruler or common
person) or before the veil that separated the Holy from the Most Holy Place
(for the entire congregation or a priest). (See Lev. 4:25, 30; compare verses
6, 17.) Thus "atonement" included priestly ministry (sprinkling of blood)
after the sacrifice had been made.
   Leviticus chapter four explains that in the case of the sin-offering for the
average person and the ruler, blood was sprinkled by the priest on the horns
of the altar of burnt offering in the court (Lev. 4:25, 30). Then part of the
flesh of the animal was cooked and eaten by the priests (Lev. 6:26, 29, 30).
The eating of the flesh represented the priest taking upon himself the sin of
the penitent sinner. (See Lev. 10:16-18.) Because he later ministered in the
holy place, the sin was taken into the presence of God and symbolically
transferred to the sanctuary. In the case of the sin-offering for the priest and
the entire congregation, the officiating priest sprinkled the blood seven times
before the veil in the holy place, and upon the horns of the altar of incense.
(See Lev. 4:6, 7.) None of the sin- offering for the priest was eaten by the
priests.
   The sprinkling of the blood and the eating of the flesh by the priests sym-
bolized the recording of pardon in the sanctuary. Christ bore "our sins in his
body on the tree" (1 Peter 2:24). Now in the heavenly sanctuary He applies
the merits of His shed blood. (See Heb. 9:12-14.) His sacrifice was a full
and complete offering for sin. But His heavenly priestly mediation is essen-
tial so that the merits of His sacrifice can be applied for every repentant
sinner.
ILLUMINATION: "The intercession of Christ in man's behalf in the sanc-
tuary above is as essential to the plan of salvation as was His death upon the
cross. By His death He began that work which after His resurrection He
ascended to complete in heaven. We must by faith enter within the veil,
`whither the forerunner is for us entered.' Hebrews 6:20."—The Great Con-
troversy, p. 489.

      HI. THE PRE-ADVENT INVESTIGATIVE JUDGMENT.
El     In the earthly sanctuary, what were the most important events of the
      Day of Atonement? Lev. 16:6-10, 15-22.



        What was the purpose of the High Priest's ministry in the Most Holy
      Place of the sanctuary on the Day of Atonement? Lev. 16:29, 30, 33.



         Of the two goats taken by the High Priest on the Day of Atonement, one
      represented Christ and the other represented Satan. The animal representing
      Christ was slain, symbolizing Christ's death upon the cross. The High Priest
      sprinkled some of its blood on the mercy seat in the Most Holy Place, on the
      altar of incense in the Holy Place, and on the altar of burnt offering in the
      court. Thus every part of the sanctuary was symbolically cleansed of the
      record of pardoned sin. The sins of the people, who had brought their sin
      offerings during the year, had been forgiven already. (See Lev. 4:26, 31, 35).
      By the sprinkling of blood in the daily service the pardoned record had been
      symbolically retained in the sanctuary. Because this record of pardoned sin
      defiled the sanctuary, it was necessary to cleanse it on the Day of Atone-
      ment.
         While the High Priest was sprinkling the blood in the Most Holy Place,
      the people were out in the court examining their hearts to be sure that all
      their sins had been confessed and put away. The Day of Atonement was an
      annual judgment day, on which the sanctuary, priests, and people were
      cleansed.

        After the vision of the "little horn" power persecuting God's people
      for centuries, what scene was Daniel shown? Dan. 7:8-10, 13, 14, 21,
      22, 25, 26.



        After the Papacy had functioned as ecclesiastically supreme for centuries,
      the heavenly judgment began. This pre-advent judgment is the antitype of
      the Israelite Day of Atonement. The period of Papal supremacy ended in
      1798 when the Pope was taken prisoner by Napoleon's general. This act
      simply marked the end of a process during which the Papacy lost its iron grip
      on the governments of western Europe. The heavenly judgment began
      shortly after this. In Daniel chapter 8 we are actually given a prophecy
      which, when interpreted correctly, reveals the year when this judgment com-
      menced.

WED      What is the nature of the pre-advent judgment? What kinds of deci-
      sions does it make?

         1. It takes place in heaven (Dan. 7:9).
         2. It involves a court session in which books of record are examined
                                                                                  77
   (Dan. 7:9, 10). This is why we call it an "investigative judgment." (On the
   heavenly books of record, see the book of life [Luke 10:20; Phil. 4:3; Heb.
   12:23; Rev. 20:12], the record of sins [Eccl. 12:14; Matt. 12:36, 37; Jer.
   2:22; Rev. 20:12; 22:12], the book remembrance [Mal. 3:16, 171.)
      3. The "Son of man" is the defense attorney in this judgment (Dan. 7:13).
   The title "Son of man" was Jesus' favorite name for Himself. (See Matt.
   8:20; 9:6; 11:19, et cetera.) Daniel 7:13 is not describing the second coming
   of Christ. The Son of man comes to the Ancient of Days (the Father) who is
   seated upon His throne before the heavenly court (vs. 9). (See The Great
   Controversy, p. 424.)
      4. Christ receives His kingdom in this judgment (Dan. 7:14). At the con-
   clusion of the pre-advent judgment, all those whose names have been re-
   tained in the book of life are delivered and saved eternally (Dan. 12:1).
   Those who once had their names in the book of life, but who did not retain
   their victorious born-again experience, have had their names taken out of the
   book of life (Rev. 3:5). Salvation depends on maintaining our relationship
   with Jesus. "He that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved"
   (Matt. 24:13).
   SEARCH AND LEARN: What do the following passages teach regard-
   ing the nature of the pre-advent judgment? Mal. 3:1-4 (compare Isa.
   4:3, 4); Matt. 22:11-14; Rev. 6:9-11; 7:1-3; 8:2-5; 11:1 (compare chapter
   10); 14:1-5; 19:2, 7, 8; 22:11, 12.
      Two prominent messages emerge from a study of the above passages: (1)
   In the heavenly temple before His second advent, the Lord conducts an in-
   vestigation of His professed people. (2) In that investigation the righteous
   dead are vindicated, and the living believers are filled with the Spirit of
   Christ and righteousness as the means of victory over sin.
   ILLUMINATION: "Now, while our great High Priest is making the atone-
   ment for us, we should seek to become perfect in Christ. Not even by a
   thought could our Saviour be brought to yield to the power of temptation.
   . . . Satan could find nothing in the Son of God that would enable him to
   gain the victory. He had kept His Father's commandments, and there was no
   sin in Him that Satan could use to his advantage. This is the condition in
   which those must be found who shall stand in the time of trouble."— The
   Great Controversy, p. 623. (See also pp. 484-491; Early Writings, pp. 48,
   71, 269-271; Testimonies, vol. 2, pp. 355, 430; vol. 4, p. 429; The Acts of
   the Apostles, p. 531; Our High Calling, p. 278.)

TAU IV. THE TIME OF THE JUDGMENT.
       The prophecy of Daniel 8 provides a foreview of history from ancient
    times to the second coming of Jesus. It covers substantially the same exten-
    sive period of history outlined in Daniel 7. The symbolism is different, but
    the two prophecies are, for the most part, parallel.
    What event mentioned in Daniel 8 is parallel to the pre-advent judg-
   ment of Daniel 7:9-14? Dan. 8:14.



   78
                                                            December
  When did both the 70 weeks and the 2300 days begin? Dan. 9:24, 25.



   The cleansing of the sanctuary was to begin after 2300 days (Dan. 8:14).
There are some vital facts about this period of time that we must notice:
   1. The phrase translated "days" means a 24-hour period. The Hebrew
phrase is 'ereb boaer. It means literally "evening-morning." A form of this
phrase is used some 22 times in the Hebrew Old Testament. When a 24-hour
period is intended the phrase is always "evening-morning." (See Gen. 1:5,
8, 13, 19, 23, 31; Ex. 27:20, 21.) When the offering of the morning and
evening sacrifice or the offering of incense is referred to, the phrase is al-
ways "morning-evening." (See 1 Chron. 16:40; 2 Chron. 2:4.) In Daniel
8:14, 26 the phrase is "evening-morning," a 24-hour period. Dan. 8:14 is
not speaking of 2300 morning and evening sacrifices of the sanctuary; or
1,150 days. The reference is to 2300 24-hour days.
   2. The 2300 days of Dan. 8:14 are symbolic of 2300 years. The prophet
was told that the work of the little horn power would continue till the end of
time. (See Dan. 8:17, 19, 25, 26.) The 2300 literal days would not reach to
the end of time. They must refer to a period of centuries, not just a period of
6 years 4 months.
   3. Gabriel told Daniel that "seventy weeks" (Hebrew: "seventy sevens")
were to be "cut off" (Hebrew: chatak) from the 2300 days. These "seventy
sevens" must refer to 490 years, because they were to reach down to the
time of the Messiah. The 490 years were to be cut off from the beginning of
the 2300 days. You cannot have 490 years cut off from 2300 literal days.
Therefore, the 2300 days are a prophetic symbol of 2300 years.
   4. Both the 70 weeks and the 2300 days began with "the going forth of the
commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem" (Dan. 9:25). Ezra 6:14
indicates that God's commandment for the rebuilding of Jerusalem, the res-
toration of the temple and its services, and the re-establishment of the Jew-
ish state was put into effect by the decrees of three Persian monarchs: Cyrus,
Darius, and Artaxerxes. The decree of Artaxerxes I Longimanus was put
into operation in the autumn of 457 B.C. (See S. H. Horn and L. H. Wood,
The Chronology of Ezra 7, Washington D.C.: Review and Herald Publishing
Association 1953, 1970). And 2300 years after the autumn of 457 B.C.
brings us to the autumn of 1844 when the pre-advent judgment began.

  How are we prepared for examination of our cases in the pre-advent
judgment? 1 John 4:13-17.



  None need fear the investigative judgment. Relationship with Christ is the
key to security. There is to be an unbroken union between our Lord and
ourselves. As we look to Christ and His sacrifice, we will have victory over
Satan's power.




                                                                            79
FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read as much as you can from
The Great Controversy, chapters 23, 24, and 28.

WHAT OTHERS TEACH: The sanctuary doctrine is virtually unknown
and untouched by other churches. No group seriously studies and preaches
this doctrine as do Seventh-day Adventists. Yet it is given more attention in
Scripture than any other single topic. The Scriptures are literally saturated
with sanctuary language and illustrations.

HOW TO SHARE THIS TRUTH WITH OTHERS: This is one of the
most beautiful subjects to help others see the grand sweep of the great con-
troversy between Christ and Satan followed by the final victory of our Lord.
It is a most Christ-centered topic. Successful presentation of the subject re-
quires mastery of its various elements. It would be well to share pictures in a
book or slides in order to make the subject vibrant and understandable. You
should share literature on the subject with those with whom you study.

SUMMARY: Christ's sacrifice on the cross was followed by centuries of
mediatorial ministry. Although the ministry of forgiveness has continued
since 1844, in that year the pre-advent, investigative judgment began. In
this judgment the heavenly sanctuary is cleansed of the record of pardoned
sin, and God's living people are spiritually purified as a preparation to meet
their returning Lord.

God Tells Us About
the Second Coming
?ZIT; MEMORY TEXT: "The grace of God that bringeth salvation
 PM hath appeared to all men, teaching us that, denying ungodliness
      and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly,
      in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and the glori-
      ous appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ"
      (Titus 2:11-13).

CENTRAL TEACHING: "The second coming of Christ. The second
coming of Christ is the blessed hope of the church, the grand climax of the
gospel. The Saviour's coming will be literal, personal, visible and world-
wide. When He returns, the righteous dead will be resurrected, and together
with the righteous living will be glorified and taken to heaven, but the un-
righteous will die. The almost complete fulfillment of most lines of proph-
ecy, together with the present condition of the world, indicates that Christ's
coming is imminent. The time of that event has not been revealed, and we
are therefore exhorted to be ready at all times."—Fundamental Belief No.

OUTLINE:
   I. Who Will Come?
  11. Why Will He Come?
 I11. When Will He Come?
  IV. How Will He Come?
   V. How Can We Be Ready?

INTRODUCTION: From the earliest days of our existence as a people,
Seventh-day Adventists have sung songs about the "blessed hope" in the
second coming of Christ (Titus 2:13). As half of our denominational name
indicates, we expect a literal second coming. Not only will Christ return but
He will return soon, although He has not revealed the specific time for this
event. Because we believe that one day we will see Jesus coming in triumph,
surrounded by His holy angels, we are happy people, and our songs reflect
this joy.
   Although no one but God knows the exact time of the second coming, it
is possible to know by studying the prophecies and signs that it is near,
"even at the doors" (Matt. 24:33). The Second Coming will bring the
earthly kingdoms of the present age to an end. It will establish God's king-
dom, the last of the kingdoms predicted in Daniel 2. Because history records
                                                                           81
that the other portions of the Daniel 2 prophecy have been fulfilled, there is
no doubt that God's kingdom will be established as predicted.

I. WHO WILL COME?

   In recent years bumper stickers on some cars in the United States have
raised the question "Guess Who's Coming Again?" People in this country
are talking about the end of the world and the second coming of Jesus to a
degree not seen since the great advent movement of the eighteen-forties.

  What is there about the promise that Jesus made in John 14:1-3 that
has inspired His followers through the ages to look forward so enthusi-
astically to His return?


   Facing the final crisis of His life on earth and ultimate separation from His
disciples, Christ gave this glorious promise for the encouragement of His
followers throughout the ages. It is one of the 318 times that His second
coming is mentioned in the New Testament. One of the greatest assurances
that we have that Christ will come the second time comes from the way He
fulfilled the prophecies of His first coming.

  How did heavenly beings attest to the fact that Christ will return?
Acts 1:9-11.



SEARCH AND LEARN: Indicate below how the Old Testament con-
tributes to our understanding of the second coming of Christ:

     0 Psalm 50:3-5

      Isa. 66:15, 16

     0 Dan. 2:44, 45

   True Christians live for the fulfillment of these prophecies. If they die
before Jesus comes, they do so with this hope in their hearts. Why? Because
true Christians love Jesus more than anyone else and long to be with Him.

THINK IT THROUGH: If you hear that a loved one that you have not seen
for some time is coming soon to see you, how do you feel?
   If you knew that a person dear to you was coming to see you soon, what
kind of information would you want? Most likely you would want to know
why, where, when, and how the person was coming. You would also want
to know what you could do to make preparations for your beloved visitor
and how best to prepare for his or her arrival. This lesson seeks to answer
these kinds of questions about Jesus' return.
82
11. WHY WILL HE COME?
  The reason for Jesus' second coming is that He loves His human brothers
and sisters and wants them to be with Him. "I go to prepare a place for
you," He told the first disciples. "And if I go and prepare a place for you, I
will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may
be also" (John 14:2, 3). Jesus will take His beloved—including those who
have died and are resurrected when He comes—to heaven with Him. (See
1 Thess. 4:16, 17.)

  What all-inclusive reason for Christ's second coming is mentioned in
Hebrews 9:28?


   Here is the one text in the Bible that links the term second with Christ's
return. History moves relentlessly toward this glorious event. It is God who
controls the future of our earth because of the victory over sin and the world,
which Jesus won at the cross. Although many today are pessimistic about
the future, Christ will come soon to make everything that is wrong right
again.
  How does Paul show that victory over the grave depends on the re-
turn of Jesus? 1 Cor. 15:19-23.


  Three important concepts can be found in this passage that discusses the
resurrection. First, Paul holds out hope for all who accept Christ. The
"blessed hope" that Christ gives the believer is not only for this life but
includes the life that the righteous receive -on the resurrection day. Second,
Paul holds out hope for those who die in Christ. He argues that if there is no
second coming of Christ, then there can be no resurrection of the dead. In
that case our belief, hope, and trust in Christ would be quite transitory and
futile. Third, Paul emphasizes the fact that the resurrection definitely takes
place at Christ's coming: "As in Adam all men die, so in Christ all will be
brought to life; but each in his awn proper place: Christ the firstfruits, and
afterwards, at his coming, those who belong to Christ" (1 Cor. 15:22, 23,
NEB, italics supplied).

  What distinction is made in 1 Corinthians 15:51-54 between what
happens to the righteous dead and the righteous living at Christ's re-
turn?



   Notice that, whether a righteous person is dead or living when Christ
returns, the glorious gift of immortality is bestowed upon both at that time,
never again to be haunted by the fear of death. Death will have lost its sting.
The grave will have been robbed of the victory it has claimed.

I11. WHEN WILL HE COME?

   There are many lines of prophecy in the Scriptures, particularly the books
of Daniel and Revelation, that indicate Jesus will return soon. But here we
will concentrate on Christ's own predictions about His second coming, pre-
dictions made during His ministry on earth.

  What did Jesus say to the disciples as they left the Temple that trig-
gered their interest in the question of when these things would take
place? Matt. 24:1-3.


   Apparently the disciples thought of the destruction of Jerusalem and the
second coming as taking place in one great climactic event. In the prophecy
that follows, Jesus answers both phases of the disciples' question. Thus the
prophecy has a double application—first to the events that surrounded the
destruction of A.D. 70, and next to the time of His second coming. In verses
4-14 we find predictions that apply to both events. Verses 15-20 seem to
find their primary fulfillment in the destruction of Jerusalem, although there
is a parallel to our day.

  What description did Jesus give of the period that was to follow the
destruction of Jerusalem? Verses 21, 22.



  This was fulfilled during the period known as the Dark Ages and contin-
ued through the middle of the eighteenth century.

  What spectacular signs were to follow immediately after the period of
great tribulation? Verse 29.
84
   Adventists are aware of the fulfillment of the signs in the sun, moon, and
stars in 1780 and 1833. But what does Jesus' prophecy mean when it states
that the "powers of the heavens shall be shaken"? See Early Writings, p.
41

  What does Luke add to the prophetic outline found in Matthew 24
that takes place after the signs in the sun, moon, and stars? Luke 21:25,
26.


   The distress of nations mentioned in verse 25 is accompanied with per-
plexity—the sea and the waves roaring. In Bible prophetic symbolism the
sea represents peoples. This phase of prophecy most likely was fulfilled in
the middle of the nineteenth century in the great revolutionary movements
among the peoples of Europe. The condition of worldwide fear described in
verse 26 certainly describes what has happened during the last half of the
twentieth century. Christ's prophetic outline reaches down to the very time
in which we are living.

  What will happen next? Luke 21:27, 28.



THINK IT THROUGH: Why does God not want us to know the exact
day and hour of Christ's return? (See Matt. 24:36.)

  Even though we may not know the exact day and hour, what can we
know in regard to the time when Christ will return? Matt. 24:32, 33.



IV. HOW WILL HE COME?

  Besides watching carefully the signs of Jesus' coming, we are to learn all
that we can about the manner of His coming. The reason for this is that
counterfeit "christs" will appear in the last days who will "deceive many"
(Matt. 24:5).

  What assurance do we have that Christ's coming will be literal, per-
sonal, and visible? Acts 1:11.


   His second coming is not to be confused with the spiritual presence of
Christ with believers since His ascension, with the descent of the Holy Spirit
as Christ's representative, or with death.

SEARCH AND LEARN: How do we know that Christ will not come in
the kind of "secret rapture" so many expect today?

     What two essential steps are we to take in order to make sure that we
   are ready for Jesus to come? Luke 21:36.

      What did Jesus mean when He challenged those who want to be ready for
   His return to "watch"? He spells His meaning out in very detailed fashion
   in seven parables of preparedness found in Matthew 24:32-25:46.

   STUDY carefully the chart that follows in order better to understand
   what it means to "watch" and to become aware of those attitudes that
   should characterize those longing for Christ's return:

a   FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read as much as you can of
    chapter 40 in The Great Controversy, "God's People Delivered," pages
    635-652.

    WHAT OTHERS TEACH: Many Christians believe Christ's coming is
    likened to a thief in the night because it will be a secret rapture. Hal Lindsey,
    author of the best seller The Late Great Planet Earth, calls it "Project
    Disappearance." These teach that Christians will be "caught up to meet the
    Lord in the air" suddenly—from whatever they are doing—driving, pilot-
    ing, teaching, performing surgery, et cetera. Imagine the colossal confusion
    that would be the result of this type of activity!
       The teaching of dispensationalism is a prominent one. Those who believe
    it hold that the references to the second coming in Scripture are primarily
    concerned with the fate of restored Israel in the last days and not with the
    church. Dispensationalists believe that the secret rapture will begin a seven-
    year period in which the Temple will be rebuilt, sacrifices commence, Israel
    will be invaded three-and-a-half years into the tribulation period, but God
    will miraculously intervene. Out of gratitude all Jews will become Chris-
    tians and evangelize the world to prepare for the second coming of Christ at
    the end of the seven-year period. Naturally this interpretation does violence
    to the seventy-week prophecy of Daniel 9 by pulling this one week period
    out of context and placing it in the future.

    HOW TO SHARE THIS TRUTH WITH OTHERS: If you are convers-
    ing with Christians, a good way to introduce this subject is to ask what they
    personally believe about the second coming. If they belong to a church ask
    what their church teaches. Pray that their questions will open the door for
    you to explain your position based on the Sabbath School lesson just stud-
    ied. If the person to whom you are talking is a dispensationalist or believes
    in the secret rapture, then carefully study this lesson and be prepared to ask
    other questions as to the meaning of certain texts that cannot be harmonized
    with these false doctrines. Above all present the second coming of Christ in
    an eager, exciting way. Let others see that you are looking forward to this
    great day, and realize how much you long to see Jesus face to face.

    SUMMARY: Summarize this fundamental belief in your own words:




    — APPLICATION
     o Do I eagerly await the coming of Christ by daily growing in grace
        through study, prayer, and witnessing?
     0 Am I able to look back on each day's activities and know that this
        day has been a steppingstone toward Christ's return?
      0 Do the things I do, eat, wear, and the places I go fit in with my belief
        in the soon return of Jesus Christ?

  H. Where Are the Dead?
 I11. What Is a Human "Spirit"?
  IV. What Is a "Soul"? Is It Immortal?
   V. Will the Dead Live Again?

INTRODUCTION: There is great interest today in the subject of life after
death. The weekly national newspapers at supermarket checkout stands of-
ten have stories and pictures of people who allegedly experienced life after
being pronounced clinically dead. When they were revived they told their
stories. The concept of life after death is also very vividly portrayed in some
television programs.
   At various times and places during the past century, studies have been
conducted suggesting that there is life immediately after death. The idea of
the immortality of the soul has pervaded the religions and philosophies of
mankind for many centuries. The Chinese built mansions, veritable ghost
towns, to house the spirits of their ancestors. Buddhists believe in
transmigration of the soul to other bodies. Hindus also believe in spirit mi-
gration, a reincarnation through other births.
   These Eastern philosophies are becoming very influential in the West.
Certain organizations and movements, some Christian and some non-Chris-
tian, are giving credence to the immortal-soul concept.
   It is vitally important to know the truth of this subject as a safeguard
against the onslaught of spiritistic philosophies and religions that are grip-
ping masses of Christians and non-Christians. What happens when a person
88
dies? Does his soul go to heaven or hell? Does it stay in the grave? Does the
dead person know what is happening on earth? Can he, as many people
believe, communicate with his living loved ones? Where are the dead? Will
the circumstances of the dead ever change, or is death the end of it all? Is
there life immediately after death, or later, or never?
   Philosophers have come up with all kinds of theories on this subject. The
doctrine of the immortality of the soul taught by the ancient Greek philos-
opher Plato (about 427-347 B.C.) very much influenced Jewish thought in
the Hellenistic period. As a result, the Jewish Pharisees believed in the im-
mortality of the soul. The Alexandrian Jew Philo, who wrote in the first
century A.D., had a considerable influence on early Christian theologians,
such as Origen (about A.D. 185-254). Hence, the Greek philosophical
teaching of the immortality of the soul became largely accepted by Chris-
tians.
   We are interested in what the Bible teaches. Only God knows the true
condition of those who have died. We turn to God for the answer.

I. WHAT DID JESUS AND BIBLE PROPHETS TEACH ABOUT
   DEATH?

  How did Christ's greatest miracle, the raising of Lazarus, reveal the
state of man in death? What did Jesus call death? John 11:6, 7, 11-14.

SEARCH AND LEARN: Compare the following Bible passages with
Jesus' teaching on the state of man in death:

  • Deut. 31:16

  • Job 7:21; 14:10-12
  • Dan. 12.2

  • Matt. 27:52

  • Mark 5:39

   • Acts 7:60

   Never did Jesus or any of the Bible writers suggest that part of man sleeps
at death while another part goes on living in a conscious state. Never do they
even imply that death is not, like sleep, a state of unconsciousness. When
the Bible writers faced death they did not expect to be conscious living be-
ings again until, by a divine miracle, their existence was restored.

  According to the inspired wise man, how much knowledge do the
dead have? Eccl. 9:5, 6, 10.



   What did Job teach about the knowledge dead people have of their
living loved ones? Job 14:21.
                                                                           89
  What knowledge of God do the dead have? Do they praise God?
Psalms 6:5; 115:17.



   The Bible teaches that the dead are sleeping, without any awareness of
what is happening on earth or in heaven. They do not praise God because
they cannot. If the good were in heaven immediately after death, wouldn't
they praise the Lord?
   The parable of the rich man and I .a7arus (Luke 16:19-31) is often used as
evidence of life in either heaven or hell immediately after death. The parable
is simply designed to teach the danger of covetousness. It offers no support
for the doctrine of the immortality of the soul. If the parable is interpreted
literally it becomes an absurdity.
   For example, the beggar went to "Abraham's bosom." Obviously that is a
symbol. Abraham would have needed a very large chest to literally accom-
modate all the righteous dead. The rich man in hell spoke of Lazarus' finger,
and his own tongue. In this parable the dead have bodies. But immortal soul
advocates believe that the souls of the dead are disembodied. Who imagines
that it is possible for the good in heaven to converse with the wicked in hell,
as they do in this parable? The rich man wanted Lazarus to go to his living
brothers and warn them. The only way that could happen, accordingto this
story, would be if "one rose from the dead" (Luke 16:31). That is quite
different from the popular idea that dead souls can communicate with the
living without a resurrection being necessary.
   Jesus was using a popular fable as a sermon illustration. He was not teach-
ing life immediately after death, or the doctrine of the immortality of the
soul. The first-century Jewish historian Josephus tells much the same fable
in other words. (See "An Extract out of Josephus's Discourse to the Greeks
Concerning Hades" in Josephus—Complete Works, translated by William
Whiston (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Kregel, 1960), pp. 637, 638).

11. WHERE ARE THE DEAD?

     The Bible explains where the dead are not, as well as where they are.

   Where did David not go when he died, despite the fact that he was a
righteous man whose sins had been forgiven? Acts 2:29, 34.



  In his great sermon on the Day of Pentecost, the apostle Peter. explained
that David's statement in Psalm 16 was a reference to the Messiah, not to
David himself (Acts 2:24-33). Peter pointed out that David was dead and
buried, and his grave was there for everyone to see. Christ rose from the
dead and ascended to heaven, but David remained in the grave, where he
saw corruption. David was a righteous man, but he did not go to heaven
when he died.
  The Bible nowhere teaches that believers in Christ go to heaven when
they die.
90
  According to Isaiah, where are the dead? Isa. 26:19.



  Where would be Job's place of waiting for the change that only God
can bring to the dead? Job 14:14; 17:13-16.



   Where are the dead? Job and Isaiah answer very positively. The dead are
in the dust of the.earth, resting in their graves, waiting for the great change
that Jesus promised would come at the end of time.
   Death need have no fears for the believer in Christ. Because it is a state of
unconsciousness, he or she.will rest sweetly until the call of the Lifegiver. If
the dead were in heaven seeing the struggles of their loved ones on earth,
how could they ever be happy? If they were in hell, suffering for long pe-
riods of time until the second coming of the Lord, it would be difficult to
understand how a God of love could bring such protracted suffering. It
would seem that the punishment would be very much in excess of the crime;
even though some people have been very wicked.

I11. WHAT IS A HUMAN "SPIRIT"?

   It is believed by many Christians that there is in each person an immortal,
immaterial part that does not sleep when the body dies. The "spirit" of an
individual is thought to go on living either in heaven or hell. Does the Bible
teach this view?

 What were the component parts of man given by God at creation?
Gen. 2:7.



   What happens to these components when a person dies? Psalm 146:3,
4; Eccl. 12:7.



  What gift from God do animals share with man? Gen. 7:15, 21, 22;
Eccl. 3:19-21.



  The breath of life given to man at creation was the life principle, or life
force that gave life to the body and existence to the individual. When a
person dies the opposite process takes place. The breath of life (spirit) goes
back to God, and the body goes back to the dust of the earth. The words
"breath" (Psalm 146:4) and "spirit" (Eccl. 12:7) are a translation of the
Hebrew word ruach. The Greek equivalent used in the New Testament is
pneuma. These words have a number of meanings:
    (i) Breath of the mouth (Psalm 33:6; Dan. 10:17; 2 Thess. 2:8).
                                                                              91
               Breath of air, wind, soft breeze (Ex. 14:21; John 3:8).
            (ii)
           (iii)The Spirit of God (Gen. 1:2; John 14:17).
           (iv)An evil spirit (1 Sam. 16:23; Luke 11:24).
            (v)The principle that gives life to the body (Gen. 6:17; 7:15; Luke
                8:55).
         (vi) The emotions, intellectual functions, and attitudes of the will
                (Gen. 41:8; Deut. 34:9; 1 Cor. 2:11; 2 Cor. 2:13).
         Never in Scripture is the "spirit" of man said to survive the death of the
      body as an immortal, conscious entity. In Ecclesiastes 3:19-21 the "spirit" is
      the life force implanted by God at Creation and shared by every living thing,
      whether man or animal.
         Some interpreters of the Bible try to use Ecclesiastes 12:7 to prove that the
      immortal spirits of good people go to heaven when they die. If the spirit in
      this verse is man's immortal soul, then the souls of all people, good and bad,
      must go to heaven when they die. No one believes that the spirits of evil men
      ascend to heaven.at death.
         The text simply teaches that the life principle given by God to a person is
      taken back by God when the individual dies. The doctrine of the immortality
      of the soul is not even implied.
         Both Old and New Testaments sometimes use the word "spirit" to refer to
      the mind of man, his capacity to reason, as well as his ability to feel and
      choose. (See Dan. 2:1; 5:12; Matt. 26:41; Rom. 1:9.) Such intellectual and
      emotional faculties never survive the death of the body. In this sense, the
      spirit is the inner life that is totally dependent upon the existence of the body.
      As we have seen, the dead person has no further reasoning powers, emo-
      tions, or powers of the will. Because the life force has been taken away from
      him, he has ceased to be a living person.

WED   IV. WHAT IS A "SOUL"? IS IT IMMORTAL?

         Did God create an immortal soul for man? Genesis 2:7 says that the body
       + the breath of life = "a living soul."
         That implies that if the breath of life were withdrawn man would be a
      dead soul. If souls can die, they are not immortal. Immortality is the capac-
      ity never to die.

      SEARCH AND LEARN: What do the following passages teach regard-
      ing the soul?

           • Ezek. 18.4

           • Rev. 16.3

           • Num 6.6

           • Matt. 10:28

           • Gen. 1:20, 21, 24, 30; 2:19

        The Hebrew word for soul used in the Old Testament is nephesh. The
      Greek equivalent used in the New Testament is psuche. The word body in
      92
       the King James Version of Numbers 6:6 translates the Hebrew word for
       "soul." The word "creature" is used to translate the Hebrew word for
       "soul" in the King James Version of Gen. 1:20, 21, 30; 2:19; 9:10, 12, 15,
       16. In all of those passages animals are spoken of as souls. God made ani-
       mals living souls just as He made man a living soul. He formed animals
       from the dust and breathed into their nostrils the breath of life. Like man,
       when the animals die, they are dead souls.
         Comparing man with God, who only has immortality? 1 Tim. 6:15,
       16.

          Because God "only hath immortality," human souls are not immortal. As
       we have seen, the human soul is composed of two parts: the body and the
       breath. Without the one the other cannot exist. The death of the body is the
       death of the soul.
          Kittel's Theological Dictionary of the New Testament comments on the
       Hebrew word for "soul" (nephesh): The soul "has no existence apart from
       the body. Hence the best translation in many instances is 'person' comprised
       in corporeal reality. The person can be marked off and counted, Gen. 12:5;
       46:18; Jos. 10:28; 11:11. Each individual is a nephesh [soul] and when the
       texts speak of a single nephesh [soul] for a totality, the totality is viewed as a
       single person, a 'corporate personality.' Hence nephesh [soul] can denote
       what is most individual in human nature, namely the ego, and it can become
       a synonym for the personal pronoun, Gn. 27:25." Volume IX, p. 620.
          The New Testament Greek word for soul (psuche) has meanings similar to
       those of the Old Testament word. It is often best translated by "life." A
       human life is a "soul." (See Mark 3:4; 8:35 where the King James Version
       translates the Greek word for "soul" by "life.")
          Nowhere in the Scriptures is the soul spoken of as a disembodied immor-
       tal entity in heaven or hell. The soul is the total personality or part of it.
       Sometimes when the word soul is used it refers to the spiritual self, or the
       intellectual or emotional self. But these aspects of soul are not conceived as
       ever separate from the physical self. When the body dies so do the other
       faculties of the soul. What is preserved for the believer is God's knowledge
       of his faithfulness, and God's promise that he will have eternal life at the
       second coming of Jesus.

   There are two resurrections: (1) "the resurrection of life," which is the
resurrection of the "just," (2) "the resurrection of damnation," which is the
resurrection of the "unjust." The first resurrection takes place at the second
coming of Jesus. This is when all of Christ's faithful people, those who are
raised from the dead and those who are translated without seeing death, are
given immortality. All of these faithful ones are taken to heaven with perfect
bodies and minds. (See John 14:1-3; Rev. 7:13-17; The Great Controversy,
pp. 644, 645.) The second resurrection, in which those are raised who died
unbelieving, takes place 1,000 years later. (See Rev. 20:5, first part, 7-9.)
The lost are never given immortality. They are consumed in the fires of the
last great day. They do not live on to suffer for eternity. (See Mal. 4:1, 3;
Psalms 37:10, 20; 68:1, 2; Jude 13; 2 Peter 2:17.)

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: On the meaning of "everlast-
ing destruction" (2 Thess. 1:9) compare: Jude 7; 2 Peter 2:6; Jer. 17:27;
2 Chron. 36:19, 21. On the meaning of "forever" (Rev. 14:11; 20:10) com-
pare: Jonah 2:6; 1:17; Matt. 12:40; 2 Kings 5:27; Ex. 12:24. On the danger
of the immortal soul doctrine read The Great Controversy, pages 531-562.

WHAT OTHERS TEACH: For centuries most of the Christian world has
espoused the immortal soul doctrine. Today the vast majority of Chistian
churches teach that the soul is immortal and that the reward in heaven or hell
is received at death. Belief in limbo and purgatory is founded on this false
doctrine.

HOW TO SHARE THIS TRUTH WITH OTHERS: Most Christians to
whom you witness believe in the immortality of the soul. Unless dealt with
very sensitively, presentation of the Bible teaching on this subject can cause
considerable conflict. Attempt to discover what the individual believes
about death before sharing your belief. Place the emphasis on life in Christ
Jesus and the hope of the resurrection. Never use crude illustrations. Do not
immediately contradict a person's belief that he or she has communicated
with the dead. First present the resurrection. Then gradually and tactfully
open up the truths found in this lesson. If you sense that an individual is
upset, immediately bring your study to a close and talk about hope in Christ
and the resurrection. Do not attempt to give the whole doctrine at one time to
people who firmly believe in the immortality of the soul.

SUMMARY: Seventh-day Adventists believe that, because of Calvary,
death is a temporary sleep for all human beings. There is no immortal part of
man that lives on after the death of the body. At the second coming of Jesus,
the righteous dead are raised and, along with their living brethren, given
immortality. At the end of the 1,000 years, the wicked are raised, punished
according to their works, and put to sleep for eternity.

— APPLICATION
 o Have I put away my fear of death because of Jesus' promise to raise
   me from the dead?
 o Am I committed to warning others of the deceptions involved in the
   doctrine of the immortality of the soul?

God Tells Us About
the Millennium
SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "Nevertheless we, according to his promise,
=VI   look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth
      righteousness" (2 Peter 3:13).

CENTRAL TEACHING: The Millennium and the End of Sin. The mil-
lennium is the thousand-year reign of Christ with His saints in heaven be-
tween the first and second resurrections. During this time the wicked dead
will be judged; the earth will be utterly desolate, without living human in-
habitants, but occupied by Satan and his angels. At its close Christ with His
saints and the Holy City will descend from heaven to earth. The unrighteous
dead will then be resurrected, and with Satan and his angels will surround
the city; but fire from God will consume them and cleanse the earth. The
universe will thus be freed of sin and sinners forever."—Fundamental Be-
lief No. 26.

      1.What Takes Place in Heaven?
      2.What Takes Place on Earth?
  IV. Events at the Close of the Millennium.

INTRODUCTION: There are three millennial views, amillennialism,
postmillennialism, and premillenialism. Amillennialism takes the position
that the thousand years of Revelation 20 is a figurative expression.
Postmillennialism turns from the figurative to a spiritualized interpretation
of the thousand years. It believes that history is moving toward'the millen-
nium when the reign of Christ will bring the triumph of the church in estab-
lishing the kingdom of God on earth. The third view, premillennialism, was
accepted by the pioneers of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. They be-
lieved and taught this under ridicule at a time when postmillennialism held
sway. The religious world in general predicted a thousand years of peace
and prosperity prior to Christ's second coming, while Adventists preached
on the authority of the Word that the world would progressively grow more
wicked. Adventists taught that the coming of Christ would take place before
the millennial reign of peace. This is called premillennialism. Adventists
believe that the millennium will be in heaven, while the other two interpreta-
tions hold that it will take place on earth.
   God raised up the Seventh-day Adventist Church for the special purpose
of proclaiming the everlasting gospel to the world in the setting of the three

                                                                           95
angels' messages. At the heart of these messages, designed to prepare peo-
ple everywhere for the second coming of Christ, is the announcement that
the "hour of his judgment is come."
   The judgment began in 1844 as Christ began His Most Holy apartment
ministry in the heavenly sanctuary. As mentioned in the lesson that dealt
with the Bible teaching on the judgment, there are four phases.
   Phase 1—The Investigative Judgment of the Righteous. "Judgment must
begin at the house of God" (1 Peter 4:17). In 1844 "the judgment was set,
and the books were opened" (Dan. 7:10; see also Dan. 8:14). The records of
those whose names are recorded in the book of life are opened to the uni-
verse in order to show who on earth is fit for eternal companionship with
sinless heavenly beings.
   Phase 2—The Executive Judgment of the Righteous. Jesus tells us that this
will take place at His second coming. (See Rev. 22:12.)
   Phase 3—The Investigative Judgment of the Unrighteous. In order to sat-
isfy any questions that may arise concerning the justness of His judgments,
God allows the records of those from earth who were not taken to heaven to
be investigated during the millennium. (See Rev. 20:4.)
   Phase 4—The Executive Judgment of the Unrighteous. When all are satis-
fied that God has been fair in determining the fate of the unrighteous, final
judgment is pronounced and executed. Sin and sinners will be no more.
   This lesson is designed to show how these four phases of the judgment fit
into the framework of the millennium set forth in Revelation 20.

     I. THE MILLENNIUM—THE PERIOD BETWEEN TWO RESUR-
        RECTIONS.

        The book of Revelation describes a period of 1,000 years known to Bible
     students as "the millennium." The term millennium is not in the Bible, but is
     derived from two Latin words—mille, meaning "1,000," and annum,
     meaning "year." In discussions of the prophecies, Bible students use the
     term to refer exclusively to the 1,000-year period set forth in Revelation 20.
     Of the time prophecies in the Bible, the starting and ending points of the
     millennium are among the easiest to establish. The millennium begins with a
     resurrection and ends with a resurrection.

       What does the Bible call the resurrection that begins the 1,000-year
     period? Rev. 20:6.



       This resurrection affects only the righteous dead, those who are "blessed
     and holy."

       When are the rest of the dead resurrected? Rev. 20:5.



       How did Jesus distinguish between these two resurrections in John
     5:28, 29?

       He called the first resurrection the

       He called the second resurrection the

       STUDY the chart on page 96. Notice in the bar at the top how the events
     that take place at the time of the first resurrection precede the 1,000 years
     and those that take place at the time of the second resurrection follow the
     1,000 years.

     H. EVENTS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MILLENNIUM.
El     NOTICE the events listed in the left hand column of the chart. These six
     precede the millennium.

       1. The Return of Jesus. This is the climax of what are known as the "last
     days." (See description in Rev. 19:11-16.)

        How did Jesus describe His second coming? Matt. 24:30.



        2. The Righteous Dead Raised. Revelation 20:4 describes the righteous
     in heaven. How did they get there? Revelation 20:6 explains.
                                                                                 97
  How does the Bible connect the resurrection of the righteous with the
second coming of Christ? 1 Thess. 4:15-17.


  3. Satan Bound. Revelation 20:1-3 describes Satan being bound at the
beginning of the 1,000 years. What does it mean for Satan to be bound?
  Ever since he first tempted Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, Satan
has occupied himself with trying to deceive people and lead them into sin.
But with the righteous in heaven and the wicked in their graves, he will have
nothing to do. The Bible pictures him as being bound with a chain (Rev.
20:1, 2). The chain is symbolic, not literal, just as we sometimes say that we
would like to go somewhere or do something but we can't because "our
hands are tied." The translation of the righteous and the death of the wicked
are links in the chain that will bind Satan. He will be isolated on this
desolated earth.

     4. Living Saints Caught Up.
  What task does Jesus assign to the angels who accompany Him on His
return to earth? Matt. 24:31.


  First Thessalonians 4:16, 17 indicates that those gathered will include
both the righteous who are living when Jesus comes and the righteous who
are resurrected at His coming.
  The righteous do not remain on the earth. Before Jesus went away He
gave the wonderful promise: "I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and
prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that
where I am, there ye may be also" (John 14:2, 3). That place is in heaven.
According to Revelation 20:4-6, the saints will live and reign there with
Christ during the thousand years.

     5. The Wicked Slain.
  Where will the wicked be during the millennium? Jer. 25:33; 2 Thess.
1:7-10.



     6. The Earth Desolated.

  How does Jeremiah 4:23-27 describe the condition of this earth after
Jesus has come and taken the saints to heaven?



I11. EVENTS DURING THE MILLENNIUM.

     1. What Takes Place in Heaven?

     What is the significance of where Revelation 15:2-4 pictures those
98
      standing who have gained the victory over the beast and its image and
      have been taken to heaven at the Second Coming? What are they doing?


        See The Great Controversy, p. 650

      SEARCH AND LEARN: Analyze the texts that follow in order to gain a
      clear understanding of what they have to say about the investigative
      judgment of the wicked that takes place in heaven during the millen-
      nium:.Dan. 7:22; 1 Cor. 4:5; 6:2, 3; Rev. 20:4, 6.
      ILLUMINATION: "In union with Christ they judge the wicked, compar-
      ing their acts with the statute book, the Bible, and deciding every case ac-
      cording to the deeds done in the body. Then the portion which the wicked
      must suffer is meted out, according to their works; and it is recorded against
      their names in the book of death. "—The Great Controversy, p. 661.
        This phase of judgment is part of the divine plan for demonstrating to the
      entire- universe that God is both just and merciful.

        2. What Takes Place on Earth?
WM,     How does the Bible show that the wicked remain dead during the
      1,000 years? Rev. 20:5.


        The, saints will be caught up and taken to heaven to reign with Christ
      during the-thousand years while the wicked will be destroyed in the bright-
      ness of His coming. This leaves the earth in a depopulated condition. Thus
      we see how Satan is,bound. He is bound by circumstances, for he now has
      no one to tempt.

         What is intended by the use of the symbol of the "bottomless pit" in
      .Revelation 20:1, 3?
        This "bottomless pit" is our earth. At Christ's coming, through earth-
      quakes, storms, and human violence, this earth will be reduced to chaos.
      (See Rev. 16:18-20; Isa. 6:11; 24:1; Jer. 4:23-27.)

        How does Isaiah portray the conditions that will prevail on earth dur-
      ing the millennium? Isa. 24:1, 3, 5, 6.


        See The Great Controversy, p. 660.

      IV. EVENTS AT THE CLOSE OF THE MILLENNIUM.
         Review the six events listed in the right hand column of the chart on p. 96
         the events that mark the close of the millennium.
         1. Christ, the Saints, and the City Descend.
         Revelation 20:9 speaks of the "camp of the saints," or the beloved
                                                                                 99
city, being on earth at the end of the millennium. From where did it
come? Rev. 21:2.


   Not only the New Jerusalem but its inhabitants come to earth to dwell,
including God Himself (see Rev. 21:3). "The earth itself, the very field that
Satan claims as his, is to be not only ransomed but exalted. Our little world,
under the curse of sin the one dark blot in . . . [God's] glorious creation, will
be honored above all other worlds in the universe of God. Here . . . the
tabernacle of God shall be with men."—The Desire of Ages, p. 26.

   2. The Wicked Dead Raised. We previously studied John 5:28, 29.
There Jesus refers to the two resurrections—the resurrection to life and the
resurrection to damnation, or judgment. Of the wicked, Revelation 20:5 de-
clares: "But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were
finished." It is clear that they come to life at the end of this period.

  3. Satan Loosed.

  How does Revelation 20:7, 8 help us understand what is meant by
Satan being loosed?


   Events reverse themselves at the end of the millennium. God and the
saints return to earth, and the wicked dead are raised. Once again Satan has
someone to deceive. Thus he is "loosed" for a little season.

  4. The Last Judgment. The last phase of the judgment is the executive
judgment of the wicked, when God will be able (because of the three phases
now completed) to do away with sin and its effect forever.

  How is this awesome judgment described? Rev. 20:9-15.


   5. Satan and Sinners Destroyed. The fire God uses to destroy sin and
sinners does not burn eternally—its consequences are eternal.

 What three phrases in Malachi 4:1 demonstrate that the final judg-
ment fire does not burn eternally?

  6. The Earth Cleansed and Renewed.

  What does Peter say will happen to this earth after it has been purged
by the fires kept in store for the judgment of the wicked? 2 Peter 3:13.



  At the end of the millennium, Satan and those who have followed him in
rebellion will be destroyed. The universe will be free from sin. And then
God will re-create this earth as the eternal home of the saved.

100
FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read as much as you can of
chapter 41, "Desolation of the Earth," and chapter 42, "The Controversy
Ended," in The Great Controversy, pages 653-678.
   On the meaning of "everlasting destruction" (2 Thess.1:9) compare: Jude
7; 2 Peter 2:6; Jer. 17:27; 2 Chron 36:19, 21. On the meaning of "forever"
(Rev. 14:11; 20:10) compare: Jonah 2:6; 1:17; Matt. 12:40;
2 Kings 5:27; Ex.12:24; 1 Cor. 5:7.

WHAT OTHERS TEACH: As mentioned in the introduction, there are
three major views of the millennium. Review these. Very few hold a specific
definite doctrine of the millennium as Adventists do. We are the major
premillennialist group, making the various details of the millennium that
follows Christ's return quite vivid and literal.

HOW TO SHARE THIS TRUTH WITH OTHERS: One way to help
others understand this truth is to present all of the details of the millennium
dealing with the second coming and the judgment, but save the teaching
about the destruction of the wicked until the last. There is a natural, logical
progression in this type of presentation that can capture the hearts of those
who are committed to an eternally burning hell fire. Emphasize the gloriescs
of the redeemed, the new earth, and the throb of unity and peace that will be
felt throughout the universe when sin and its effects will be eradicated for-
ever.

SUMMARY: Just as there is a time between a person's death and resurrec-
tion to new life, so there is time between the world's end and its re-creation
as the new earth. This time is called the millennium, the thousand years
during which the wicked dead know not anything, the righteous living are in
heaven, and Satan and his angels are confined to this desolate planet. For the
saved the millennium will be a time of reflection, judgment, and investiga-
tion as to why the wicked were lost.

—APPLICATION
 o Does the millennium doctrine give me a sense of security in knowing
   the future and final climax of sin and the restoration of our world to
   its Edenic beauty?
 * How often does it cross my mind as to where I will be during the
   thousand years?
 O Am I determined that by God's grace I will be inside the New Jerusa-
   lem at the end of the thousand years?

God Teas Us About
the New Earth
SAB   MEMORY TEXT: "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for
pM    the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there
      was no more sea. And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem,
      coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride
      adorned for her husband" (Rev. 21:1, 2).

CENTRAL TEACHING: "The New Earth. On the new earth, in which
righteousness dwells, God will provide an eternal home for the redeemed
and a perfect environment for everlasting life, love, joy, and learning in His
presence. For here God Himself will dwell with His people, and suffering
and death will have passed away. The great controversy will be ended, and
sin will be no more. All things, animate and inanimate, will declare that God
is love; and He shall reign forever. Amen. "—Fundamental Belief No. 27.

INTRODUCTION: The poems and hymns of Fanny Crosby have had a
profound influence on the spiritual lives of millions of people in many lands.
The phenomenon of a blind woman being able to express in verse the deep-
est sentiments of the believer's heart captured the imagination of nineteenth
century Christians. Her hymns are sung with genuine appreciation by mod-
ern churchgoers.
   Fanny's cousin Dr. Howard Crosby, a Presbyterian minister, died of
pneumonia at age 65. His last message stirred Fanny to the depths of her
soul. He had written that no one need fear death, and added: "If each of us is
faithful to the grace which is given us by Christ, that same grace which
teaches us how to live will also teach us how to die."
   Taking up her pen, in just a few minutes Fanny wrote the famous poem
that soon after became the well-known hymn "Saved by Grace."

  Someday the silver cord will break,
  And I no more as now shall sing;
  But, 0, the joy when I awake
  Within the Palace of the King!
102
  Someday, when fades the golden sun
  Beneath the rosy-tinted west,
  My blessed Lord will say, 'Well done!'
  And I shall enter into rest.

   Many questions come to mind when we consider the condition of the
saved in the earth made new. First is the question When is the earth made
new? Last week's lesson emphasized that during the 1,000 years after Jesus'
second coming the saved will be in heaven, while this earth will be in a state
of desolation inhabited only by Satan and his evil demons. How does God
change that situation?
   What will the capital of the new earth be like? In their present state human
beings are not able to understand the magnificence of their eternal inheri-
tance. Even so, the Scriptures provide a faint glimpse of the unsurpassed
loveliness of the home that Jesus is preparing for His people.
   What will the saved be like spiritually and physically? It is difficult to
imagine a world free from temptation to sin, free from hatred, discrimina-
tion, and war, and free from sickness, disease, and death. Is there any possi-
bility that evil will reappear after the earth has been recreated by God? Will
the saved have complete security without any fear that their world of glory'
and peace will be shattered by some new threat?
   How can we be sure that Fanny Crosby's dream will be realized? For
whom will this dream come true? How do we prepare to inhabit the earth
made new?

I. WHEN WILL THE EARTH BE MADE NEW?

  When do Christ and the saved descend to this earth? Rev. 21:2;
20:7-9.



  What does God do immediately after the destruction of the lost? Rev.
21:1; 2 Peter 3:13, 14.



   At the end of the millennium Satan will be released from his prison by the
raising of the lost from the dead. Then he and his demons once again will
have people to tempt. Christ and the saved will descend from heaven in the
holy city, the New Jerusalem, and the city will come to rest on this earth.
Satan will lead his hosts of lost to besiege the city with the plan of making an
assault upon it. At that point their plan will be interrupted by Christ's ap-
pearing on the "great white throne" above the city. (See Rev. 20:11.) The
final judgment will take place, and fire will come down from heaven, de-
stroying the wicked and purifying the earth. (See The Great Controversy,
pp. 664-673.)
   Before the wondering gaze of the redeemed within the holy city, the de-
formed old world is converted into a paradise of unexcelled loveliness.
                                                                            103
  What did Isaiah write regarding God's intention to renew the earth?
Isa. 65:17, 18, 21, 22; 66:22.



  What a picture of permanence and security! No more building and some-
one else inhabiting, no more planting and someone else reaping, no more
end of life. There will be no painful reminders of our former misery. The
Lord's assurances and promises are certain to be fulfilled.
  Present disappointment and suffering are so much less difficult to bear
when we consider the joys and fulfillments that are in store for us. Isaiah's
words provide wonderful reassurance: "For since the beginning of the world
men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, 0
God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him" (Isa.
64:4).

11. WHAT IS THE NEW JERUSALEM LIKE?

   No human pen can adequately describe the magnificence of the New Jeru-
salem. We can only read the Bible description and try to imagine what it will
be like.

  What is the New Jerusalem called? How does John describe it? Rev.
21:9-26; compare 19:7, 8.



    The New Jerusalem is called "the bride, the Lamb's wife" (Rev. 21:9). It
is the home of Christ's faithful people who were married to Christ during
their earthly sojourn. Both the people and the city are called the bride be-
cause the city is the eternal home of the real bride—those who before the
Advent were judged worthy of eternal life.
    The frequency of the number 12 in the description of the city indicates its
perfect symmetry. It is a perfect home for a spiritually perfected people. The
wall of jasper, the city itself of translucent gold, the foundations of precious
stones, the gates of pearl, the massive size—all suggest to the mind the most
beautiful architectural wonder the human mind could possibly conceive. But
it is impossible to depict accurately the dimensions and glory of the city.

ILLUMINATION: "I know something of the glory of the future life. Once
a sister wrote to me and asked if I would not tell her something about the city
of our God, further than we have in the Word. She asked me if I could not
draw something of its plans. I wrote her that I would have to say to her, 'Put
off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy
ground. "No, ' said I, `you cannot paint, you cannot picture, and the martyr
tongue cannot begin to give any description of the glory of the future life;
but I will tell you what you can do: you can "press toward the mark for the
prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus." You can die to self; you
can seek to grow up to the perfection of Christian character in Christ Jesus.'
That is our work; but when men begin to meddle with God's Word, I want to
tell them to take their hands off, for they do not know what they are
104
doing"—Ellen G. White comments, SDA Bible Commentary, vol. 7, p.
920.

  Why is there no temple in the New Jerusalem? Rev. 21:22.



   When the saved are translated to heaven at the second coming of Jesus,
they are taken to God's temple. (See Rev. 7:15; compare 20:4.) This is the
heavenly sanctuary spoken of in Hebrews 8:1, 2, in which the sin problem is
finally disposed of during the millennium. After that there is no need of a
temple. Sin has at last been excluded from the universe.

HI. WHAT IS THE SPIRITUAL CONDITION OF THE SAVED?

  When Jesus said, "My kingdom is not of this world" (John 18:36), He
meant that His kingdom is spiritual, not temporal; not characterized by
worldly power or human pride. His eternal kingdom on the earth made new
will be primarily a spiritual realm in which holiness is perfectly and perpet-
ually manifested.

  Who will dwell with the saved for eternity on the earth made new?
Rev. 21:3.



   Paul wrote of Christian experience on this earth as freedom in Christ.
"Christ is all, and in all" (Col. 3:11). On the earth made new the redeemed
will look up to Jesus as the only One who bridged the terrible gap created by
sin. He will be their eternal fulfillment. They will understand that apart from
Him there would be no meaningful everlasting life. Throughout eternity,
Christians will ever hunger and thirst for more of Jesus—more understand-
ing of His human life and works, more communion with Him, more time
witnessing with Him to unfallen worlds. They will ever seek to become
more like Him. They will live with and for Christ. To them, He will be
everything forever.
ILLUMINATION: "The people of God are privileged to hold open com-
munion with the Father and the Son. Now we see through a glass, darkly.'
1 Corinthians 13:12. We behold the image of God reflected, as in a mirror,
in the works of nature and in His dealings with men; but then we shall see
Him face to face, without a dimming veil between. We shall stand in His
presence and behold the glory of His countenance."—The Great Contro-
versy, pp. 676, 677.

  Of what will the saved partake throughout eternity? Rev. 22:2; 7:17;
21:6; 22:17; compare John 4:14.



   In the new earth, the river of life flows "out of the throne of God and of
                                                                           105
      the Lamb" (Rev. 22:1), and runs parallel with the city's street. The tree of
      life forms an arch over the river, with roots on both sides (Rev. 22:2). Every
      month it will bear new fruit. Throughout eternity the saved will partake of
      the tree of life and the water of life. This symbolizes that their perpetual
      existence, both spiritually and physically, will be maintained by their con-
      stant union with Christ. Thus the promise of Christ to the woman of Samaria
      will be completely fulfilled to her and to the redeemed of all ages. (See. John
      4:14. )

        What special day of worship will be observed on the new earth? Isa.
      66:23.



      ILLUMINATION: "So long as the heavens and the earth endure, the Sab-
      bath will continue as a sign of the Creator's power. And when Eden shall
      bloom on earth again, God's holy rest day will be honored by all beneath the
      sun"—The Desire of Ages, p..283..
         "When there shall be a 'restitution of all things, which God hath spoken
      by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began' (Acts 3:21), the
      creation Sabbath, the day on which Jesus lay at rest in Joseph's tomb, will
      still be a day of rest and rejoicing. Heaven and earth will unite in praise, as
      `from one Sabbath to another' (Isa. 66:23) the nations of the saved shall bow
      in joyful worship to God and the Lamb."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 769,
      770.

WED   IV. WHAT PHYSICAL AND MATERIAL BLESSINGS ARE EN-
          JOYED BY THE SAVED?

        One of the most exciting features of the new earth is that we will be real
      people in a real world. We will not be ethereal spirits divorced from work .
      and social activities that are meaningful to humans.

      SEARCH AND LEARN: Summarize what the following passages teach
      regarding the physical and material condition of the saved:

        • Phil. 3:20, 21

        • 1 Cor. 13:12

        • Isa. 65:17-25

        • Isa. 11:6-9

        • Isa. 33:17, 20-22, 24

        The new earth is a real place inhabited by real people with real emotions
      and feelings, who will experience the real life that God intended for our
      parents in Eden. The new earth is a place where we will know our friends
      and loved ones, and be known by them. We will perform real work with real
      hands_and enjoy the results of our labor. It will not be the arduous labor of
      106
this fallen world, but the most satisfying and fulfilling work. There will be
scope for every noble- ambition. Isaiah 65:20 does not mean that sin and
death will exist on the new earthAsaiah's message had a dual application; to
Israel as a nation, and to the end-time situation when earthly kingdoms have
been swept away and God's kingdom established. Israel could have enjoyed
great spiritual, physical, and material blessings, if the people had followed
the will of God. There would have been little infant mortality, little physical
sickness. Because of Israel's failure, the promises to her have been inherited
by the Christian church. (See Gal. 3:28, 29.) Now the secondary application
of Isaiah's prophecy applies. Those features involving sin and death no
longer have relevance. But the predictions concerning the "new heavens"
and the "new earth" run parallel with those of John in the book of Revela-
tion.
   "The former things Ware passed away" (Rev. 21:4), and "the former shall
not be remembered, nor come into mind" (Isa. 65:17). The Lord will not
allow the memories of earth's. struggles, disappointments, and heartaches to
destroy the peace and contentment of His people.

ILLUMINATION: The great controversy is ended. Sin and sinners are no
more. The entire universe is clean. One pulse of harmony and gladness beats.
through the vast creation. From Him who created all, flow life and light and
gladness, throughout the realms of illimitable space. From the minutest
atom to the greatest world, all things, animate and inanimate, in their
unshadowed beauty and perfect joy, declare that God is love."—The Great
Controversy, p. 678..

V. ARE YOU READY FOR THE NEW EARTH?

  What is Jesus' earnest desire for each of us? John 17:24.



  What is the spiritual qualification for inhabiting the new earth? Rev.
14:3-5; 21:7, 8, 27.


  Christ will accept as a subject for His kingdom the person who, by His
grace, overcomes sin. Throughout the book_ of Revelation, emphasis is
given to the blessings for the overcomer. (See Rev. 2 and 3.) Christ craves to
give us the victory that He experienced. (See Rev. 3:21.) He offers all the
necessary power to make us conquerors. (See Jude 24; 1 John 5:2-4.)
   You can be an overcomer because of your spiritual union with Christ. He
wants to dwell within you by His Holy Spirit and live out His life through
you. (See John 14:23; 17:23; Gal. 2:20.) There are enormous material and
physical blessings for the saved in the new earth. But the real issue confront-
ing us today is spiritual. Christ is offering spiritual advantages: victory over
all sin, and purity of heart and mind. (See 2 Cor. 7:1; 1 Peter 1:15, 16).
These blessings can be yours now and forever. The spiritual qualities that
will characterize the saved are to be yours now; because Jesus offers Himself
to you now. His righteousness is yours now (Rom. 8:9, 10). His presence in
your heart is yours now (John 14:18).
                                                                            107
   Christ assures us that what we give up for Him is not for our best good
anyway. What a thrill we will have in the new earth of being totally free from
the demands of fallen natures and the attacks of the evil one. Ultimate spirit-
ual liberty will be the experience of God's redeemed people. In the truest
sense, they will be free at last!

FURTHER STUDY AND MEDITATION: Read The Great Controversy,
pp. 674-678; Education, pp. 301-309; Testimonies, vol. 1, pp. 67-70.
WHAT OTHERS TEACH: Seventh-day Adventists endeavor to make
heaven and the new earth more literal and inviting than do most denomina-
tions. Other churches make general references to the subject, but nothing is
concrete. We owe much to Ellen White's visions and descriptions of the new
earth. She has painted a tangible picture that is thoroughly relevant to most
people. On the subject of the after life, most people express themselves in
the negative. Often you hear the remark that heaven is not a place where
people sit on a cloud strumming a harp. That usually ends the discussion,
and nothing positive or real is offered the hearers.
HOW TO SHARE THIS TRUTH WITH OTHERS: This is one of the
most exciting subjects to share with others. The only controversial aspect is
the question of where heaven is. Some denominations are trying to make a
heaven now on earth. Some speak as if the present life will be our only
heaven. As you study this subject with others it will be fresh and new to
most of them. Make sure that your own heart is overflowing with eager
anticipation of living with Christ and the redeemed for eternity.
   The following principle is important to remember: "We should not be so
anxious to gain the reward as to do what is right, irrespective of all gain.
Love to God and to our fellow man should be our motive. "—Christ's Object
Lessons, pp. 398, 399. The great motivation that should be emphasized in
sharing this truth is not the mansions in which we will live, the gardens we
will plant, and the fun we will have free from pain, sickness, and death.
Even though that is all good, the most powerful motivation is the eternal
fellowship we will have with the One who, for the sake of our redemption,
left the fellowship of heaven and risked failure and eternal loss.
SUMMARY: Seventh-day Adventists believe that God will restore our
world to its original state of perfection at the end of the millennium when the
New Jerusalem will descend from heaven. After the earth has been purged
of sin and its results, God's people will be spiritually, intellectually, and
physically perfect in a paradise of Edenic loveliness.

— APPLICATION
  • After studying this lesson, do I better understand why Jesus said that
    there will be weeping, wailing, and gnashing of teeth on the part of
    those who will be lost?
  o How much time do I spend thinking about things above as compared
    to things on the earth?
  • Are you willing to receive Christ as your present Saviour from sin?
  • Will you resolve to seek Him daily so that when He comes there will
    be no doubt at all about your eternal destiny?

Lessons fon. Fivsit euarileos, 1989
   Sabbath School members who have not received a copy of the Adult
Lessons for the first quarter of 1989 will be helped by the following
outline in studying the first two lessons. The title of this series is "Le-
viticus and Life."

[Filvsit Lesson:
"SANCTUARIES OF SALVATION"
  MEMORY TEXT: Hebrews 10:1.
 THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Insights on Leviticus from the New Testa-
ment. Hebrews 11:4, 7; 10:1-4; Acts 13:32, 33, 38, 39.
   CENTRAL THOUGHT: God's method of saving sinners is the same
in all ages. Salvation comes through faith in the Saviour whom God
provided to pay the penalty for our sins.
  OUTLINE:
    I. The Faith of the Patriarchs (Heb. 11:4, 7; Gal. 3:8; John 8:56).
   11. The Faith of Israel (Heb. 10:1-4).
  I11. The Faith of Christians (Acts 13:32, 33, 38, 39).

Second Lesson:
  "CLEANSING FROM THE LEPROSY OF SIN"
  MEMORY TEXT: 1 John 1:7.
  THIS WEEK'S STUDY: Leviticus 12-15.
   CENTRAL THOUGHT: In Scripture leprosy is used as a symbol of
sin. The cleansing ceremony focused on Christ's ministry of healing and
resulted in the restoration of lepers to full fellowship with God and man.
Only the grace of Christ can cleanse us from the inner contamination of
sin.
   OUTLINE:
    I. Defiled By Sin (Lev. 13:6, 23, 28, 34; 15:31-33; Matt. 8:4).
   11. The Defilement Cleansed (Isa. 6:1-7; Matt. 12:34; John 5:22;
       1 Peter 4:5).
