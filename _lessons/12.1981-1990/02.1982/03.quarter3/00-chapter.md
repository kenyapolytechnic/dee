          Hospital Adventiste D'Haiti was dedicated April 26, 1981, to the service of the
          people of Port-au-Prince and its surrounding area. Your Thirteenth Sabbath
          Special Projects offering December, 1977, contributed $135,000 to this pro-
          ject. The significant contributions and vision of many dedicated Adventist
          physicians initiated the dream of this hospital for Haiti, while two lay organiza-
          tions and dozens of volunteers worked to stretch your gift and the appropia-
          tions from the Inter-American Division into the full-service hospital unit now
          ministering effectively to the glory of God.

          This Thirteenth Sabbath you may again join the members around the world in
          giving for the cause in Inter-America. Your Special Projects offering dollars
          (25% of the Thirteenth Sabbath offering) will help build churches in the North
          Dominican Mission and in the South and Southeast Conferences of the Mexi-
          can Union. They will also aid the construction of a new women's dormitory at
          crowded Antillian College in Puerto Rico.

          The Lord has richly blessed the efforts of enthusiastic laymen in Inter-America.
          Church growth is better described as mushrooming or exploding. Let us do

                             INTRODUCTION


           The Christian in the

   Ever since Christ called His church into existence, Christians have been
struggling with the problem of how to be in the world without being of the
world. Though it is an old theme, every generation of believers must find the
answers to that question for itself. And each unit of believers must seek its own
forms of relating to the world in the particular setting in which it is called to
witness for Christ.
   The reason for this is clear. Our world is constantly changing. New chal-
lenges are thereby arising to the life of the church, its mission, and to the believ-
ers' growth in grace and in Christian maturity. Solutions from the past do not
always fit the way in which we live today. Moreover, our world is made of
vastly different cultures and societies, of religions and ideologies, of political
and social orders, of values and patterns of thinking. That means that the
relationship between the Christian and the world cannot, and should not, take
exactly the same forms everywhere. For instance, what appears to be an ac-
ceptable form of Christian behavior in one culture—say dress, music, or social
patterns between male and female—may not be appropriate in another. The
same applies to the relationship of the Christian to government, the economic
order, or social institutions. Though the varying and ever changing circum-
stances in the world may demand different forms of relating to the world, all
these forms must be firmly based on sound biblical principles. To discover
the biblical principles that deal with the relationship between the Christian and
the world is the primary purpose of this series of lessons.
   Our Adventist pioneers lived in the expectation of the immediate coming of
our Lord and Saviour. Their whole life and mission had such an urgency that
they considered everything and every activity in the world which did not con-
tribute directly to the advance of their cause as waste, if not actually sinful.
After nearly 140 years the believers have, in some places, lost much of that
 urgency. This is greatly affecting the attitude of the Christian toward the
world and the things that are of this world. We realize, as Ellen White stated,
 that as long as they are in the world, God's people have to do with the things of
 the world. (See Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 459.) However, believers who take their
 calling seriously must know that their first citizenship is in the kingdom of God.
 Its goals and principles, therefore, should be our first concern. At the same time
 we must become more aware of the fact that these goals and principles are to be
 realized in this world. To that end Christ sent us into the world so that all
 people may have opportunity to be saved and come to the knowledge of the
 truth. (See 1 Tim. 2:4.) The Christian must therefore constantly ask him-
 self: In what ways can I best represent Christ in the world, at work, in my daily
 activities, among neighbors and friends? And by what attitudes, life-style, and
 behavior can I best make the kingdom of God a present reality as well as a hope
 for the future?
                                                                            5

.Rhe Mout:1

  "God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who-
soever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For
God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the
world through him might be saved" (John 3:16, 17).

   In most languages the term "world" has a variety of meanings.
That is also true for the languages in which the Bible was written—
Hebrew and Greek. There is no one word in Hebrew that corresponds
to our term "world." But there are a large number of equivalents, such
as "heaven and earth," the "all," "age" (era), and the "habitable
earth." In Greek the words most frequently used for "world" (kosmos
and aion) have at least six major meanings and many different shades of
meaning. Which meaning intended in the text can be determined only
by the context in which the word occurs. For instance, the apostle
John urges us not to love the world, for, if anyone loves the world, love
for the Father is not in him. (See 1 John 2:15-17). Yet, is not the very
heart of the gospel the assurance that God loves this world? (See John
3:16, 17.) In 1 Corinthians 1:20-31 and 3:19 the apostle Paul mentions
that the wisdom of this world is foolishness in the eyes of God. Yet,
Jesus Himself, in Luke 16:8, commends the sons of this world for being
wiser in their generation than the sons of light. Scripture indicates that
this world stands condemned in the eyes of God, and—because of
Christ's work—has already been judged. (See John 5:24-30; 12:31.) At
the same time we hear God say that in Christ He has reconciled the
world unto Himself and that Christ had not come to judge the world.
(See 2 Cor. 5:19; John 3:17; 12:47.) All these statements would appear
contradictory if we did not realize that in each instance the term
"world" has a different meaning.
  This insight is also important with regard to our attitude toward the
world. Often our attitude has been shaped by one or two texts or by one
or two different meanings only. We must learn, however, to listen to the
whole biblical message concerning the world, in which each meaning is
complemented and rounded out by the others.

                                                                      June 27

   Part 1   "Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by
WE BY GOD the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of
          things which do appear" (Heb. 11:3).

               Science has given us tremendous insights regarding the phys-
            ical world, its processes and workings, its laws and its nature.
            For an understanding of the origin of our world, its purpose and
            goal, however, we must turn to divine revelation. The world
            itself does not show us its origin, its purpose, its future.

              What does Scripture tell us about the origin and purpose of our
            world? Gen. 1:1; 2:4; Job 38:1-4; Ps. 19:1-4; Isa. 45:18; Col. 1:16.

               A number of important insights emerge from these and other
            passages of Scripture:
               1. Our world came into existence by the word of God (Ps.
            33:6).
               2. It was made for God's own glory (Ps. 8:1; 148:13).
               3. Our world has beauty and orderliness; it bears the stamp of
            its Maker, and speaks of His eternal power and deity (Rom. 1:20).
               4. Our world belongs to God (Ps. 24:1).
               5. It continues only by the gracious will of God, who cares for
            it and who sustains its processes and workings (Acts 14:15-17).

               For whom did God create the world? Gen. 1:26; Ps. 8:5, 6.

               The more we penetrate outer space, the more we realize how
            unique our world is: the air we breathe, the climate surrounding
            us, the land and the water, the vegetation and the animal world.
            The Bible indicates that this whole world was prepared as a
            habitat for human beings. Each time that God completed a part of
            it, He "saw that it was good." This means that it was well
            suited for the particular purpose for which God had prepared it.
            "On every leaf of the forest or stone of the mountains, in every
            shining star, in earth and air and sky, God's name was writ-
            ten."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 51. From the way the Cre-
            ation account is given, it may be concluded further that each step
            was meant as a preparation for the next. Last in the creation of
            the world came man, made in the image of God, for whom it all
            was called into existence.

             Where in the created universe do you see reflected the glory of
            God and His eternal power and deity?

 Part 2     "The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and
OWED      they that dwell therein" (Ps. 24:1).
BY GOD
             In a beautiful example of Hebrew poetry whereby the second
          half of a verse parallels, balances, and enlarges the thought of the
          first half, this song of David stresses that everything on earth be-
          longs to God—its resources and energies, its food supplies and its
          wealth, our homes and our factories, even we ourselves who live
          and work in it. "All that we Kaye is from God. He lays His hand
          upon our possessions, saying: 'I am the rightful owner of the
          whole universe; these are My goods.' "—Testimonies, vol. 9, p.
          245.
             The basis for God's ownership of the world and its contents
          is that He has made it all. He also gives us life and breath and
          everything. (See Acts 17:25.) "In him we live, and move, and
          have our being" (Acts 17:28).
             In Psalm 24:1 we see that the environment and man both belong
          to God. This suggests the close tie between human beings and
          what surrounds them. What does that say to us concerning our
          relationship to the natural world?

            What commission has God given to humanity in regard to the
          world? Gen. 1:26-28; 2:15, 18-20; Rev. 14:6, 7.

             At least four points stand out clearly: (1) Human beings were
          made to glorify God (Isa. 43:7; 1 Cor. 6:19, 20). (2) They were
          made for each other: to love and to strengthen each other, to chal-
          lenge and to complement each other. (See Luke 10:27; 1 John 4:7-
          12.) (3) They were commissioned to be fruitful and to fill the
          earth. (Today, the world population numbers almost 5000 mil-
          lion people!) (4) God put them in charge of His world, as His stew-
          ards, to explore its riches and resources and to develop the world
          and to preserve it, under God.

            What difference do you see between man's way of glorifying God
          and the way the rest of creation glorifies Him? (See John 15:8;
          Matt. 5:16; Rom. 15:5, 6.)

            In all of God's earthly creation only we humans have the ability
          to acknowledge God as the Creator. The rest of the world does
          so unawares, not by its own choice or volition. Only we can con-
          sciously respond to our Creator and in freedom fulfill the task for
          which we were placed here.

            What does our stewardship of God's world entail?

             A Biblical View of the World                            1   Tuesday
                                                                         June 29

    Part 3     "That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh
THE WORLD    into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made by
AS PEOPLE    him, and the world knew him not" (John 1:9, 10).

               The very core of the biblical meaning of the term "world"
             includes people—human beings, as individuals or groups, such as
             families, language groups, races, societies, nations (Mark 16:15;
             Luke 2:1; John 6:33; Rom. 1:8). The world also means the
             things with which people are involved—human work, cultures,
             and organizations (Matt. 16:26). It can also mean the theater of
             human history. All this is what the psalmist calls the world and its
             fullness. (See Ps. 50:12; 89:11; etc.)

               What is God's attitude toward this world of nations, kindreds,
             tongues, and people? John 3:16, 17; 1 John 4:9; Luke 11:9-13; Eph.
             4:6.

                God loves this world! That message ought to be proclaimed
             from every rooftop in every corner of earth to every person. God
             is our Father, the One who really cares about His creatures,
             whatever their situation in life or their cultural, political, or ethnic
             background. And God loves this world and cares for it simply be-
             cause He is love (1 John 4:8). Because God is love, He created
             this world. He commissioned us to explore the earth and to de-
             velop it, to build it and to shape it, because He is love. And even
             though we humans have largely failed to recognize God as our
             Father, and have ignored, even rejected, His love, God has re-
             mained the same in His attitude toward the world which He has
             created. He is unchanging (James 1:17). He "keeps faith for
             ever" (Ps. 146:6, RSV). Even "if we are faithless, he remains
             faithful—for he cannot deny himself' (2 Tim. 2:13, RSV).

               In what ways is God's faithfulness toward His creation experi-
             enced in the world? Matt. 5:45.

               The world, as God's creation, retains some goodness, happi-
             ness, beauty, and joy. There is friendship and love, wisdom,
             ingenuity, and strength. Man still is crowned with some honor
             and glory; his work still reflects his divine commission (Gen. 1:26-
             28; 2:15). In spite of all the effects of sin on human life, thought,
             and activity, this world of man still reflects something of the
             goodness, glory, and power of its Maker.

               In light of God's own attitude toward the world, how should we
             relate to the people of this world and their activities?

     Part 4     "We know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wick-
THE WORLD     edness" (1 John 5:19).
    IS EVIL
                 Because of Adam's sin the whole world came under the spell of
              evil. People, created for the glory of God, turned away from Him
              (Rom. 3:9-19). The result is that relations between people be-
              came broken, their activities became self-seeking, and their men-
              tal and physical strengths declined. In fact, sin has so much pene-
              trated every nook and cranny of our life that our whole earthly
              existence, from our conception onward (Ps. 51:5), is evil. Even
              nature itself, the physical world, is suffering from this bondage to
              evil (Rom. 8:18-23). In the Bible the term "world" therefore has
              the connotations of lawlessness, greed, vainglory, hatred, selfish-
              ness, oppression, foolishness, revolt, and sin.

                How has sin affected the relationship between God and the
              world? James 4:4; 1 John 2:15-17.

                God and the world have become opposites! There is a wide
              gulf between them, characterized by hatred, enmity, and hostility
              of the world toward God. People must choose whether they want
              to become citizens of the kingdom of God—which is not of this
              world—or to remain subject to Satan, the prince of this world
              (John 14:30); for these two kingdoms have nothing in common.
              They are opposites. The one represents life, purity, love, and
              goodness; the other—the world—stands for death, corruption,
              hatred, and evil.

                What therefore should be the Christian's attitude toward the
              world? 1 Cor. 2:12; James 4:4; 1 John 2:15-17; 5:4, 5; Rev. 18:4.

                The only safeguard for a Christian lies in his separation from
              the world. "Do not be conformed to this world," the apostle Paul
              urges us, "but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that
              you may prove what is the will of God, what is good and accept-
              able and perfect" (Rom. 12:2, RSV). (See also John 18:36 and
              Matt. 13:22.)

                How would you define the terms "worldly" and "worldliness"?
              (See Titus 2:11-14; 1 John 2:16.)

                 "The rebuke of the Lord is upon His people for their pride
              and unbelief. He will not restore unto them the joys of His salva-
              tion while they are departing from the instructions of His word
              and His Spirit."—Testimonies, vol. 5, p. 190.

                                                                         July 1

   Part 5  "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not im-
ECONCILED puting their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the
  TO GOD word of reconciliation" (2 Cor. 5:19).

               The message of Scripture is that God has, in Christ, recon-
            ciled the world unto Himself. Jesus, the Lamb of God, has taken
            away the sin of the world (John 1:29). God has not ignored the
            world in its state of wickedness or left it completely under the
            power of the evil one. He has sent His Son into the world to save
            it (John 3:17).

              What is the meaning of the term "reconciliation"? Rom. 5:1, 8-
            11; 2 Cor. 5:18, 19; Eph. 2:12-18.

              There are clearly two aspects to the work of reconciliation.
            The first refers to the new relationship of peace brought about
            between God and man. The previous relationship of enmity and
            hostility has been changed to friendliness and close communion.
            Before, we were strangers to God; now we have become God's
            children and members of His household (Eph. 1:4, 5). The wide
            gulf between God and the world has been removed! Man can have
            free access to the Father.
              The second aspect points to the key to this new relation-
            ship—forgiveness and taking away of our sins. This is an act of
            cleansing. Jesus has taken away the sin of the world. He has
            borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; with His stripes we
            were healed (Isa. 53:4-9). The power of evil in the world has
            been broken. The prince of this world has been judged (John
            16:11). A whole new relationship has been brought about between
            God and the world. This was accomplished at the cross.

               Besides reconciliation, what was the effect of the death of Christ
             upon the world? John 3:18-21; Rom. 13:11-14.

               With the death and resurrection of Christ the world has entered
             upon its last stage of history. A new era has begun—the era in
             which a separation is being made between those who accept Jesus
             Christ as Lord and Saviour and those who are rejecting Him. In
             the first group is being fulfilled God's promise of a new creation, a
             new world, which will be fully realized at the end of time when the
             restoration of all things will take place. The second group—the
             world of evil—is being condemned for its pride, greed, selfish-
             ness, and sin, and prepared for its total destruction. With God's
             act of reconciliation came also the judgment of the world (John
             9:39; 12:31).

               To which group in the world do I belong?

  Part 6      "I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but
 III THE    that thou shouldest keep them from the evil" (John 17:15).
 WORLD
BUT . . .      Six different aspects of the biblical term "world" stand out
            clearly: (1) God's good creation, in its physical as well as its so-
            cial, cultural, and historical aspects; (2) people and their activi-
            ties, ideas, thoughts, and work; (3) fallen humanity as the object
            of God's love; (4) people who have rejected Christ, or who hate
            Him and His disciples; (5) those who have accepted Christ, God's
            new creation, which is the beginning of a new world; (6) the mil-
            lions of people who have never even heard of Christ.
               In the New Testament, these six constitute one unit—a total-
            ity. It is impossible to separate one aspect from the other. God's
            good creation is thoroughly infected by sin, but in all the evil of
            the world, God's goodness and love still triumph. In fact, it is be-
            cause of God's patience and grace that this evil world of ours still
            exists. (See 2 Peter 3:3-10.)
               In the New Testament evil and sin are not tied to particular
            things, actions, people, or places. Separation from the world does
            not mean, therefore, isolation from people and their activities, but
            rather from all vainglory, selfishness, and greed. There is much
            in this world that is good and beautiful and given for our happi-
            ness and enjoyment. But if we use it for our own advancement
            and selfish ambitions, then even the best of our thoughts and ac-
            tions will reflect the evil spirit of this world. Religion is no excep-
            tion!

             For what purpose has God placed us in this world? Isa 43:7;
            Mark 16:15; John 17:18; Rom. 12:1, 2.

              It may all be summed up in these words: to glorify God (Rev.
            14:7), to serve our neighbor, and to act as stewards of the world
            which God has created for us. The Christian attitude toward the
            world, therefore, is on the one•hand positive, an affirmation of the
            purpose for which God has placed us here. On the other hand it
            must also be a rejection of all evil thoughts and actions.

              What does it really mean to be in the world without being of the
            world?

               In this time of mass communications the child of God has a
            greater struggle to be not of the world than has been true since the
            days of Sodom. At the same time he has never been kept so in-
            stantly in touch with the events and needs of the world that are
            flashed everywhere. How earnestly must this call, to be in but not
            of the world, be considered today!

                                                  Adult Lesson




U'ra Mulch lin uaraxe

  "We who first hoped in Christ have been destined and appointed to live
for the praise of his glory" (Eph. 1:12, RSV).

   Last week's lesson ended with the question: "What does it really
mean to be in the world without being of the world?" Christians gener-
ally agree that God has placed them in the world. Great disagreement
exists, however, over the question of how to be in the world.
   Basically, Christians hold to two views with regard to the church's
relationship to the world. Both views are thoroughly biblical and rooted
in Old and New Testament imagery. But, whereas in Scripture these
two views hold each other in balance, and correct and complement each
other, in the history of Christian thought and practice these views have
generally become isolated from each other. Each of these views gave
rise to different, even opposite, concepts of mission and evangelism,
different forms of church life and church organization, even different
interpretations of Scripture and of the church's calling and destiny.
   One view holds that the church in its relationship to the world is
"Christ's fortress in a revolted world."—Medical Ministry, p. 89. In
this view, the church and the world are opposites: the one holy and
good, the other corrupt and evil. These two are engaged in a fierce
battle, a great controversy.
   The other view, also thoroughly biblical, emphasizes that Chris-
tians should not isolate themselves from the world nor deny themselves
the riches of the world, which, in the words of the apostle Paul, God has
furnished us to enjoy. (See 1 Tim. 6:17.)
   The answer to the question about how to be in the world does not
lie in a compromise between these two views. Rather, it lies in the
 proper balance between the two. We must emphasize, more than ever
 before, the radical difference between believers and unbelievers, be-
tween the church and the world—in life-style, in thoughts, and in be-
 havior. On the other hand, we should also stress that the church does
 not exist for itself, but for the sake of the world. Like salt, Christians
 must mingle with the people of the world and penetrate its whole life
 with the savor of the gospel. That was Christ's way. And His way is
 the only true way.
                                                                   13

      Part1     "0 Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high
THE CHURCH    mountain; 0 Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice
A FORTRESS    with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah,
              Behold your God!" (Isa. 40:9).

                In Old Testament times Israel was frequently described un-
              der the symbol of Zion, the hill upon which the old city of David
              was situated. (See 2 Sam. 5:7; 1 Kings 8:1.) It was a symbol of the
              place—and its people—where God dwelt, His church on earth.
              The same applied also to Jerusalem, the city of God. In New
              Testament times it became the symbol of the true church where
              people would find refuge, peace, and redemption.

                What other images does the New Testament use to describe the
              church's difference and separation from the world? Eph. 2:19-22;
              1 Peter 2:5; 3:20, 21.

                 The ark of Noah, tossed about by storm and flood, is a fitting
              symbol of the church in the world. Outside is death and destruc-
              tion, evil, and danger. Inside is safety, life, and redemption. Some
              have therefore seen in the boat stories in the Gospels an allusion
              to the church in the world. Water and winds were considered
              symbols of evil. Only in the boat is safety. (See Matt. 8:23-27;
              14:22-27.) A person has to come out of the world and remain sepa-
              rated from it in order to be saved.
                 The image of the building suggests the same: safety and secu-
              rity lie in coming out of the world and into the building. The
              church is such a "spiritual house."
                 The illustrations of an ark and of a building both suggest the
              visibility of the church in the world, its status and strength. But
              whereas the boat is a finished product, the building is not com-
              pleted. It is in the process of construction. Only the Foundation
              and the Cornerstone are laid forever, and made known to the be-
              lievers through prophets and apostles.

                How does the image of a building affect the life and conduct of the
              believer? Eph. 2:19-23; 1 Peter 2:5.

                The believer identifies himself with the family of the house.
              He shares in the full rights of the home, but he also must loyally
              fulfill his duties of service to strengthen the fellowship, to build up
              the house, and to protect it against its enemies.

                What do the images of the church as a fortress, a walled city, or
              an ark suggest as to the organization of the church?

      Part 2      "Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour,
THE CHURCH     wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but
    AS SALT    to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men" (Matt. 5:13).

                 Salt serves three positive purposes—to season, to preserve,
               and to purify. These may be applied to the functions of the
               church. Thus the church is called to season the world, to pre-
               serve it, and to purify it.

                  "Salt must be mingled with the substance to which it is added;
               it must penetrate and infuse in order to preserve. So it is through
               personal contact and association that men are reached by the sav-
               ing power of the gospel. They are not saved in masses, but as
               individuals. Personal influence is a power. We must come close to
               those whom we desire to benefit."—Thoughts From the Mount of
               Blessing, p. 36.

                 What is the greatest danger to the church as salt? Luke 14:34.

                 Salt is not used in large amounts to season food, but is sprinkled
               on it. Even so the church is as single grains spread in the world to
               which it has been added. The greatest danger is that it becomes
               so absorbed by its environment that it loses its saltiness. Then it
               can no longer function; it is worthless. What does that say about
               the danger of living in the world?
                  In addition to being a sign of the covenant of God, salt had sev-
               eral meanings in Old Testament symbolism. Salt was added to
               every sacrifice in the Old Testament ritual services (Lev. 2:13).
               Without salt the sacrifices were unacceptable. Here the salt
               stands for the righteousness of Christ. "Referring to this practice,
               Jesus said, 'Every sacrifice shall be salted with salt." Have salt in
               yourselves, and have peace with one another.' All who would
               present themselves 'a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God'
               (Rom. 12:1), must receive the saving salt, the righteousness of our
               Saviour. Then they become 'the salt of the earth,' restraining
               evil among men, as salt preserves from corruption. Matt. 5:13.
               But if the salt has lost its savor; if there is only a profession of
               godliness, without the love of Christ, there is no power for good.
               The life can exert no saving influence upon the world. Your en-
               ergy and efficiency in the upbuilding of My kingdom, Jesus says,
               depend upon your receiving of My Spirit. You must be partakers
               of My grace, in order to be a savor of life unto life."—The Desire
               of Ages, p. 439.

                  How would the aim and methods in the mission of the church as
               salt differ from those of the church as a fortress?

 Part 3   "Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation,
A HOLY a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who
IIATIOII hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light" (1 Peter
        2:9).

           The term "holy nation" suggests a great difference between
         the church and the world. But whereas the images of the church
         as fortress, ark, building, or city stress the difference in form and
         place; holiness is a difference of being. It should be noted immedi-
         ately, however, that this holiness is not the result of man's own
         choice or work, but a divine gift. Our Lord Jesus Christ "gave
         himself up for her, that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her
         by the washing of water with the word" (Eph. 5:25-27, RSV).

           What Bible meanings for the terms "holy" or "sanctified" could
         be applied to the church? See Gen. 2:3; Lev. 11:44, 45; John 17:17;
         Heb. 13:12.

           The first meaning is that the church is set apart from all ordi-
         nary things or thoughts or activities in the world. It is the opposite
         of secular or profane or worldly. Second, it means that the church
         did not come into existence by its own choice, but by the will of
         God, who has called it. They are His people! A third meaning is
         that the church—that is, the members of the church, the living
         stones of this holy temple—are made pure of mind and perfect of
         character. Whereas the spirit of the world is characterized by self-
         ishness, greed, quarreling, pride, hatred, envy, and corruption,
         saints do not defraud one another or take each other to court; they
         are loving, humble, tolerant, patient, peaceful, and compassion-
         ate. "Against such there is no law" (Gal. 5:23).

           What is the purpose of the church's election as a holy nation?
         1 Peter 2:9.

            As with Israel of Old Testament times (Ex. 19:5, 6), the
         church was not elected for its own self but for the whole world.
         Divine election, either of an individual or of a whole group, is al-
         ways for the sake of others. "The church is God's appointed
         agency for the salvation of men. It was organized for service, and
         its mission is to carry the gospel to the world. From the begin-
         ning it has been God's plan that through His church shall be re-
         flected to the world His fullness and His sufficiency. The mem-
         bers of the church, those whom He has called out of darkness into
         His marvelous light, are to show forth His glory."—The Acts of
         the Apostles, p. 9.

           How can individual believers best grow in holiness? in isolation
         from the world, or by involvement with the world?

YEAST    mixed with half a hundredweight of flour till it was all leavened"
         (Matt. 13:33, NEB).

           It is a characteristic of yeast that it works quietly; yet it influ-
         ences the whole lump of dough and supports the shape of the
         whole loaf. Yeast becomes one with the lump. Yeast represents
         the way the Holy Spirit works in the human life and also teaches
         us how believers ought to relate to their culture and society, influ-
         encing them by their spirit, and changing them from within, rather
         than from without.

           In what ways does the picture of the church as yeast complement
         and correct that of the church as fortress or building? How does
         that in turn need to be broadened by the view of the church as a holy
         nation? (See Matt. 13:33; Eph. 2:19-22.)

           The image of the building and of the fortress emphasizes not
         only the visibility of the church in the world but also its firmness
         and commmitment to principles and truth. The apostle Paul, in
         his letters to Timothy, specifically mentions this aspect of the
         church as the pillar and bulwark of the truth. (See 1 Tim. 3:15.)
         The same image of upright support is used in Colossians 1:23 as
         an appeal to firm faith and unshakable hope. A similar message is
         found in Revelation 3:12.
           The church as yeast becomes part of the world to influence it
         from within. Principles of freedom and human dignity, concern
         for the poor and the oppressed, even science and technology are
         some aspects of modern society which have been shaped- by the
         Christian "yeast." But such elements of modern life as equality
         between male and female, justice for minority groups, concepts of
         work, of marriage, sex, and family, need the constant influence of
         the Christian yeast, and a whole lot of it! To accomplish that
         function of influencing society and culture from within, the yeast
         needs constantly to be complemented by the view of the church
         as a holy nation and as a fortress.

           What forms of mission and ministry best reflect this view of the
         church as yeast?

           "The followers of Christ are to be separate from the world in
         principles and interests, but they are not to isolate themselves
         from the world. The Saviour mingled constantly with men, not
         to encourage them in anything that was not in accordance with
         God's will, but to uplift and ennoble them."—Counsels to Teach-

              The Church in the World?                            2    Thursday
                                                                          July 8

     Part 5     "These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but
    ALIBIS    having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and em-
MID EXILES    braced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims
              on the earth" (Heb. 11:13).

                  Some may feel that the image of the church as aliens and exiles
               runs counter to the view of the church as citizens of secular soci-
               ety (Rom. 13:1-7). How can the same church be composed of
               those who are no longer strangers and pilgrims, and yet at the
               same time consist of aliens and exiles? The answer is quite sim-
               ple, though full of tensions: Christians must be both! As members
               of the church they are citizens of the kingdom of heaven.
               Therefore they do not fit in with the kingdom of darkness,
              .where evil lusts are in control (1 Peter 2:11). As members of soci-
               ety they are one with the people among whom they live and work
               as Christ came into continual contact with the world, its ambi-
               tions, activities, and desires. But in these matters they must re-
               main "strangers." Finally, as the records of the men of faith
               testify in Hebrews 11, Christians should never become settled on
               this earth. To be a Christian in the world means to be a pilgrim.
               And that means that, except for time spent in training centers,
               Christians should not colonize together but constantly live dis-
               persed among the people of the world. (See, for example, James
               1:1; 1 Peter 1:1.)

               How are believers actually exiles and aliens in their own world?
              Heb. 11:8-16.

                 Everyone who is a member of the household of God thereby
              becomes a stranger in his own culture and country for all of his
              life (1 Peter 2:11).

                 What did Jesus say that indicates the risk of living as aliens and
              strangers in the world? Matt. 10:16-18, 22; 24:9, 10.

                 Any society resents those strangers in its midst who do not join
              in worshiping the popular idols or in detesting those whom soci-
              ety discriminates against.

                 What really is the relationship between loyalty to God, witnessing
              to His name, and persecution?

               The Church in the World?                                2    Friday
                                                                            July 9

      Part 6     "Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did
1BASSADORS     beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to
 FOR CHRIST    God" (2 Cor. 5:20).

                 In this week's lesson, so far, it has been pointed out that there
               are two ways in which the church must relate to the world. On the
               one hand there's the demand to come out of the world and to be
               separate from it. On the other hand we are plainly told that the
               essence of being the church in the world is to become one with the
               people of the world in taking an interest in their needs, interests,
               work, and ambitions. Since both views are clearly biblical, we
               now must give consideration to the question: How are these two
               views related? And how can they both be implemented? Let there
               be no misunderstanding about it: The church must be both
               wholly different from the world—in its life-style, thought pat-
               terns, and conduct—and at the same time be part of the world and
               identify with its needs and activities. It cannot be denied that
               there is an inherent tension here. But we must learn to live with
               that tension and make it fruitful in our lives.

                 Describe the role of an ambassador for Christ. Eph. 6:20; 2 Cor.
               5:17-20.

                 We are called to represent Christ in and to the world. And at the
               same time we are called to bring the world to Christ. In order to
               do so we must be both a member of the household of Christ and a
               child of this world in the same way that Christ Himself was both
               the Son of God and the Son of man. Christian life in the world is
               characterized by a pendulum movement. We are called out of the
               world and sent back in; we are gathered and dispersed. This
               pendulum movement has at least three aspects. First, there is
               the weekly rhythm of coming out of the world where we live and
               work to worship and fellowship together on God's holy day. As
               we worship and fellowship together, we realize that we are not
               doing it for our own selves, but to the glory of God and for the
               sake of the world. Each worship service, therefore, should be a
               preparation for our dispersion into the world, for whom the
               church exists. Second, there is our daily involvement in the
               world's secular affairs and our coming out of the world to be with
               Christ in our daily devotions. Third, we participate in the am-
               bassadorial role of the church as missionaries, serving, proclaim-
               ing, and returning with the fruit of our labor.

                  Why must we balance these two views of the church?

  "As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into
the world" (John 17:18).

   The incarnation is at the heart of the gospel. It teaches us clearly
what God's objectives are for His church on earth today: (1) In Christ
the work of salvation has been accomplished. In Him God has recon-
ciled the world unto Himself. The kingdom has come! This message
of redemption, freedom, and peace, however, needs to be proclaimed in
all the world. To that end has Christ sent us into the world. (2) The
message of the New Testament is that, with the first coming of Christ,
the kingdom of God has become a reality on earth. (See Matt. 4:17;
12:28.) This kingdom, however, does not consist of words, but of
deeds. (See Luke 6:46-49.) It is a lived reality, embodied in flesh and
blood, in conduct, and in relations between people. (See verse 21.)
(3) Christ came into this world to bring healing to the sick, to set at
liberty those who are oppressed, to feed the hungry, to help the poor, to
strengthen those who are weak. (See, for example, Luke 4:18-21.) In
obedience to our Master and in imitation of His own example, we must
make Christ's goals our own! (See Isa. 58:6-10; The Desire of Ages, p.
369.) (4) Jesus came into this world to unmask the devil and to show the
true nature of evil and sin (1 John 3:8). Said Jesus Himself: "I saw Satan
fall like lightning from heaven" (Luke 10:18, RSV). And immediately
He then added, "I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and
scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy" (verse 19, RSV). (5)
Jesus said that for judgment He had come into the world (John 9:39).
This work of judgment is also being accomplished through His
church. By putting their trust in God and accepting the light which
shines into the world through the proclamation, service, and fellowship
of the church, people will be saved. But those who choose darkness
over light are thereby condemned already (John 3:18, 19). The com-
mission to preach the gospel of salvation is therefore at the same time a
warning of the judgment. All this is accomplished by participating in the
work of Christ from the heavenly sanctuary through the power of His
Spirit.

   Part 1     "The Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost"
 TO SAVE    (Luke 19:10).
THE LOST
              When man fell into sin, a plan began to unfold immediately
            whereby God's wayward children could be saved and His king-
            dom could be restored. At first God had talked to man face to
            face; but after Adam and Eve had sinned, God could reach them
            only through intermediaries. No man can see God and live (Ex.
            33:20). So God sent to man His angels, His Spirit, His help, and
            redemption (Ps. 20:2; 1 1 1 :9)—sometimes also the plague and the
            sword (Jeremiah 27 and 29). He has sent prophets and other peo-
            ple with special messages of hope. At one time God even called a
            whole nation into existence and placed it at the crossroads of the
            world with the goal of bringing an end to all suffering, quarreling,
            and oppression in the world. But none of these agencies could
            accomplish what God has accomplished in Jesus Christ, His own
            Son; namely, "to redeem those who were under the law, so that
            we might receive adoption as sons" (Gal. 4:5, RSV), and to re-
            store the kingdom of God.

              What has been the effect of Christ's saving ministry in the world?
            Rom. 3:24-26; 5:1-11; 6:4, 9-11; Gal. 3:24-29; Col. 1:20-23; 2:6, 7.

              "Jesus came to restore in man the image of his Maker. None
            but Christ can fashion anew the character that has been ruined by
            sin. He came to expel the demons that had controlled the will. He
            came to lift us up from the dust, to reshape the marred character
            after the pattern of His divine character, and to make it beautiful
            with His own glory."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 37, 38.

              In what way are Christians called to participate in Christ's minis-
            try of salvation? Mark 16:15; Matt. 28:19, 20; 2 Cor. 5:20.

               The Saviour's commission to the disciples included all the
            believers. It includes all believers in Christ to the end of time. It is
            a fatal mistake to suppose that the work of saving souls depends
            alone on the ordained minister. All to whom the heavenly inspira-
            tion has come are put in trust with the gospel. All who receive the
            life of Christ are ordained to work for the salvation of their fellow
            men. For this work the church was established, and all who
            take upon themselves its sacred vows are thereby pledged to be
            co-workers with Christ."—The Desire of Ages, p. 822.

              Who are the people in your part of the world who have not yet
            heard the gospel? In what ways could you best be involved in the
            work of reaching them?

                                                                           July 12

       Part 2     "This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for
 TO RESTORE     a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come" (Matt.
THE KINGDOM     24:14).

                   With the coming of Christ the kingdom of God has become es-
                tablished. The great pillars of that kingdom are love, freedom,
                humility, and obedience. At one time the whole universe was
                based on these principles. But then pride arose in the mind of Lu-
                cifer. He perverted the freedom which God had granted to His
                creatures; and, moved by selfish ambition, he led many to revolt
                against the King of the universe, first the angels, then also man.
                Not only was the harmony in the universe broken and God's au-
                thority put in question, but Satan also claimed the earth as his and
                styled himself the prince of this world. And indeed, through his
                control of men, he held dominion over the world. But in Christ,
                God's sovereignty over the world has been restored; the way is
                open for man to be set free from the power of the devil. The
                dominion Adam had lost through sin has been recovered by Je-
                sus. The principles of God's kingdom have been proved true
                and right, and man can be restored to the image of his Maker.

                   What evidence did Jesus give that the kingdom of God was re-
                stored? Matt. 11:4-6; 13:19, 24, 31, 44, 45, 47.

                  The coming of the kingdom of God is the central theme of
                Jesus' life and work. It is the fundamental message of His par-
                ables, and is supported by His miracles. That evidence, how-
                ever, rests on our acceptance of His Word. If we fail to see who
                Jesus really is—namely, the Messiah—then even His miracles are
                no evidence that the kingdom has come. But to those who repent
                of their sins, and accept Jesus as their Lord and Saviour, these
                miracles are clear signs that the kingdom of God has indeed been
                established in Christ.

                  In what ways are Christ's followers today called to restore and to
                build the kingdom of God? Matt. 24:14; 28:19, 20; Rev. 14:6, 7;
                18:1-3.

                   The kingdom is brought about by God Himself, but He uses
                human instrumentality to implement it. Christ has called His
                church to set up the kingdom of God in the world. (See The Acts
                of the Apostles, p. 16.) And, though that kingdom of God is not of
                this world, it does express itself in earthly realities such as rela-
                tionships between people, human conduct, work, art, and cul-
                ture.

   Part 3     "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me
 TO HELP    to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the
THE POOR    brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and
            recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are
            bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord" (Luke 4:18,
            19).

              Bible commentators generally agree that "the acceptable year
            of the Lord" refers to the year of jubilee; that is, every fiftieth
            year, when the slaves were freed, debts were canceled, property
            was returned to its original owner, and provisions were made for
            the poor. (See Leviticus 25 and 27.) The work of Christ had this
            effect too. "Explaining the words He had read, He spoke of the
            Messiah as a reliever of the oppressed, a liberator of captives, a
            healer of the afflicted, restoring sight to the blind, and revealing to
            the world the light of truth."—The Desire of Ages, p. 237.

              How has this work of the Messiah been fulfilled in Jesus' life and
            work? Matt. 11:4-6; 14:14-21.

               It is important to stress here that Jesus was not sent to reform
            society or to create a new economic order. Yet the implementa-
            tion of the principles of the kingdom of God had that effect! The
            poor found a new dignity and the oppressed a new equality. The
            hungry were filled with good things, and the rich were sent away
            empty. (See Luke 1:53.) And wherever the gospel of the kingdom
            is preached with power, people are transformed and—as a re-
            sult—societies are changed!

              In what ways should the followers of Christ today follow the di-
            rection of Jesus and the example of His apostles? Matt. 10:5-8; Gal.
            2:9, 10.

               At the time of writing this lesson, over 60 percent of the world
            population is undernourished; some 20,000 people are starving to
            death every day. In many areas of the world, poverty has reached
            such a deplorable state that it is robbing people of their human
            dignity. Millions of people lack the most basic form of human
            freedom; large groups of people are being oppressed. What
            should the church's mission be in these conditions? (See The De-
            sire of Ages, pp. 637, 640.)
               What part are we as Sabbath School members having in the
            various channels of outreach to the world's physical needs?
            Through community services, Seventh-day Adventist World
            Services, and other agencies than our own, we can help. Fel-
            lowship in serving brings us near to the heart of Christ.

     Part 4     "For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might
TO UNMASK     destroy the works of the devil" (1 John 3:8).
 THE DEVIL
                 Jesus came into this world to unmask the devil and to show the
              true nature of evil and sin. The devil conceals his real purpose
              and hides behind a "screen of light" so that he can lead us astray.
              But he is a liar! (See John 8:44.) Jesus came to make that very
              clear. Christ also explained to His hearers that evil often appears
              in the disguise of respected social and religious leaders and in the
              form of accepted institutions, rules, and regulations. Jesus
              warned the people of "the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sad-
              ducees" (Matt. 16:6, 11). By revealing to the world the real
              source of evil and the different forms it takes in life, Jesus actually
              destroyed the work of the devil. He bids us to follow His exam-
              ple.

                In light of the following passages, why do you think it was impor-
              tant for Christ to reveal the true nature of the devil and sin? Rev.
              12:7-11; Heb. 2:14, 15; 1 Thess. 5:22; 1 Peter 3:10-12.

                 It is imperative for us to understand the true nature of sin and
              the forms and disguises in which evil operates in this world. How
              else would we be able to "resist the devil" (James 4:7)? How
              would we be able to overcome evil unless we know what and
              where it is? (See Rom. 12:21; 1 John 2:13, 14.)
                 But there is another reason still. Our world is a spectacle to the
              whole universe. Even the angels who have remained loyal to God
              did not quite comprehend the nature of sin and of Lucifer's rebel-
              lion. For the good of the universe, therefore, it has become im-
              perative that the true character of the devil and his workings be
              clearly understood. In the life and death of Christ, this work has
              been accomplished.

                How should the followers of Christ participate in this work of
              unmasking the devil and of revealing the true nature of evil in the
              world? Matt. 10:1, 7.

                 A church that takes seriously its mission in the world will pro-
              claim and practice principles of truth that will clearly contrast
              with the evil that keeps millions of people in physical, mental,
              spiritual, or social bondage and threatens the growth of the be-
              lievers.

                Should Christians publicly denounce evil in society if certain
              practices, habits, and institutions clearly defy the principles of the
              kingdom of God? (See The Desire of Ages, pp. 509, 510.)

                                                                           July 15

     Part 5     "Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they
 TO JUDGE     which see not might see; and that they which see might be made
THE WORLD     blind" (John 9:39).

                 It is on the basis of the sacrifice of Christ at the cross and the
              work of the Holy Spirit on hearts that have never heard the actual
              gospel story that the world will be judged. A man without a
              knowledge of what constitutes sin is not held accountable for his
              sinful deeds. After a person has learned by the law what sin is and
              has been offered pardon through the blood of Jesus Christ, he be-
              comes responsible for his deeds. When he continues living in sin
              and remains separated from God, he is guilty and stands con-
              demned before God. This is what divides the spiritually seeing
              from the spiritually blind. The proclamation of the gospel,
              therefore, always carries with it a warning of the impending judg-
              ment. Jesus Himself explains it this way: If a person accepts the
              light and lives by it, he does not fall under the judgment. But if a
              person rejects the light of life and chooses to remain in darkness,
              he stands already condemned before God. (See John 3:16-20.)

                How are Christians called to participate in this work of judgment
              today? Matt. 18:15-18; 1 Cor. 6:1-5; Gal. 6:1.

                It is through the life and work of the church that God is bringing
              about the judgment. Christ sends us as light into darkness, in the
              same way as He Himself came as the light of the world. (See John
              8:12; 9:4, 5; Matt. 5:14-16.) If people refuse to live by the light and
              choose darkness, they are thereby condemned.
                This raises the question: Do we represent Christ so that peo-
              ple who have seen and heard us have seen and heard Christ?
              The world will be judged by its attitude toward Christ. But if
              they have never heard or seen Him clearly in the lives and words
              of the church, then how can they be held responsible? The call
              to mission is an awesome responsibility.

                When will a final judgment take place? John 12:31; Heb. 9:27;
              Jude 6; Rev. 20:4.

                In a sense, the judgment began with the first coming of Christ.
              However, the Bible speaks of a certain day at the end of time
              when the living and the dead will be judged. In preparation for
              that great day, Christ has called into existence a movement which
              He has sent into all the world to warn it of impending judgment.

               Are we really preparing the world for this great day of judgment?
              What does this work imply?

     Part 6     "Of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have
  TO TAKE     such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the
   PART IN    Majesty in the heavens; a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true
JUDGMENT      tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not men" (Heb. 8:1, 2).

                Christ's mission did not end at the cross. After His ascension
              He was seated at the right hand of God (Eph. 1:20-23) where He
              continued His work. An understanding of Christ's continuing
              work in the heavenly sanctuary is needed in order for the church
              to understand fully its mission in the world today. The church
              has no other mission but to participate in the continuing work of
              Christ.

                What is Christ's work in the heavenly sanctuary, in which He has
              called us to participate? Eph. 1:19-23; Heb. 4:14-16; 9:24; 2 Cor.
              5:10.

                 This work of Christ is threefold: He is Lord and Ruler of all
               things; He serves as man's Mediator and High Priest; He is Judge
               of all.
                  First, it is because Christ has been given full authority and all
               power in heaven and on earth that His mission on earth contin-
               ues. It was on the basis of that power and authority that Christ has
              sent us into all the world as His ambassadors (Matt. 28:18-20).
               Mark says that when the Lord sat down at the right hand of God,
              His disciples went forth and preached everywhere, while the
               Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs
              that attended it (Mark 16:15-20). And beyond that, Christ is ruling
              over this world in the affairs of nations and in the activities of
              men. The book of Revelation gives us a powerful description of
              Christ's ruling activities in the world, in which the church is
              called to participate through obedience, faithful witness, humble
              service, and love.
                 Second is Christ's ministry of reconciliation. He lives contin-
              ually to make intercession for us (Heb. 7:25); He is drawing peo-
              ple to Himself (John 12:32) and is making applications of His
              atoning sacrifice at the cross (Heb. 10:19-22). This intercessory
              work is just as essential to accomplish His mission of restoration
              and reconciliation as was His death upon the cross.
                 Finally, Christ is at work as Judge. Since 1844, this work,
              which the Father had entrusted to the Son (John 5:22), has been
              in its final stage. Those who have received Christ and His Word
              will be separated from the ones who rejected Him. Now is the
              time in which this separation will be final, and the saints will in-
              herit the kingdom which the Lord has prepared for them.

Christ Our
Example
  "I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done to you.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord;
neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. If ye know these
things, happy are ye if ye do them" (John 13:15-17).

   In Christ's mission to the world His followers find the purpose and
direction of their own mission. The direction is toward the millions of
people on earth in their needs, interests, and activities. The purpose
is that all these people be saved and the kingdom of God be restored.
And since we are living in the last days of this world's history, this mis-
sion of reconciliation, warning, and restoration has an immense ur-
gency. Jesus said that as the Father had sent Him into the world, so
He sent the disciples into the world. (See John 17:18; 20:21.) This
thought was the theme of last week's lesson study, but it has another
dimension still. It tells us about our Sender and the purpose of our mis-
sion in the world. It speaks about the kind of work we are called to do,
but it also emphasizes what kind of life the followers of Christ should
live and how their mission in the world can be achieved.
   Some will say now that the life and the work of Christ in the world
were so particular, and therefore so different from ours, that they can-
not be the model for us. In a way, of course, that observation is correct.
After all, He was the Christ, the Son of the living God (Matt. 16:13-16).
   Yet the Bible also tells us that Jesus was verily man. He is called the
Son of man, an expression used more than 80 times in the Gospels to
 indicate that "as Jesus was in human nature, so God means His follow-
ers to be."—Sons and Daughters of God, p. 21. Found in the likeness
of man, Jesus became as one of us. (See Rom. 8:3; Phil. 2:8; Heb. 2:10-
17.) He was subject to our infirmities and weaknesses; He identified
 with our needs, frailties, and failings. He also subjected Himself to all
 the humbling conditions of man in this world and was in everything
 tempted as we are (Heb. 2:14-18), all with one exception: Jesus did not
sin (Heb. 4:15).
    From His Sonship and His divine origin we may learn the purpose
 of our life and mission in the world. In His humanity, Jesus has shown
 us how to live in this world, and how we can fulfill the purpose and
 mission of our lives.

     Part 1    "I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work
TO GLORIFY    which thou gayest me to do" (John 17:4).
      GOD
                These words truly characterize the whole person and life of
              Jesus Christ: "I have glorified thee on the earth." He did not seek
              His own glory (John 8:50), but the glory of Him who sent Him
              (7:18). His whole life and thought centered in God. And because
              of that total surrender of His will and His whole self to God who
              sent Him, Jesus could be the person He was and accomplish His
              mission in the world.

               Give some clear examples of how Jesus glorified God in His life.
              Matt. 4:1-10; John 4:34; Luke 5:23-26; 18:18, 19.

                 From the very beginning of His life to the very end Jesus
              lived for God, glorifying Him and doing His will only. As a child,
              Jesus explained to His earthly parents: "Did you not know that I
              must be in my Father's house?" (Luke 2:49, RSV). His love for
              His heavenly Father came first. Faced with temptation, Jesus
              found in His surrender to God His power and strength to over-
              come the evil one. And because of that attitude, the devil left
              Him. Whereas the first Adam failed because of his desire to be
              equal with God, the second Adam, though of divine origin Him-
              self, "did not think to snatch at equality with God, but made him-
              self nothing. . . . He humbled himself. . . . Therefore God
              raised him to the heights" (Phil. 2:6-9, NEB).
                 At the end of His life, when He was wrestling in the garden,
              Jesus cried out: "Not my will, but thine, be done" (Luke 22:42).
              He would rather die, in obedience to God, than to seek a way out
              that was not according to God's will. Is not the hallmark of Jesus'
              life in this world contained in His words: "My food is to do the
              will of him who sent me" (John 4:34, RSV).

                What was the effect of this attitude of Jesus on the people who
              heard Him and saw Him? John 8:37-43.

                 To His believing followers, Jesus said, "Truly, truly, I say
              to you, he who believes in me will also do the works that I do; and
              greater works than these will he do, because I go to the Father.
              Whatever you ask in my name, I will do it, that the Father may
              be glorified in the Son; if you ask anything in my name, I will do
              it" (John 14:12-14, RSV).

                What detracts me in this world from really following Christ's ex-
              ample to glorify God in my life?

  Part 2     "Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for
  DOING    the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made
HIS WILL   heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters" (Rev.
           14:7).

             Seventh-day Adventists have found in this message of the first
           angel of Revelation 14 the foundation of their work and mission in
           the world. All too little attention has been given, however, to the
           question of how these nations, kindreds, tongues, and people
           could be persuaded to give glory to God and to honor Him.
           From Jesus' own example we may have to learn that people
           believe what they see in others. When our lives are, by the grace
           of Christ, a reflection of God's character, and thus a praise to His
           name, the world will better know what it means to give glory to
           God.

             What are some of the ways in which we are called to glorify God?
           John 15:8; Rom. 15:5-9; 1 Cor. 6:20; 10:31.

             "Love for God, zeal for His glory, and love for fallen human-
           ity, brought Jesus to earth to suffer and to die. This was the
           controlling power in His life. This principle He bids us adopt."
           —The Desire of Ages, p. 330.
              The kingdom of God and its righteousness should be first and
           uppermost in our minds and hearts, ambitions and desires (Matt.
           6:33). We must learn to pray again "Thy will be done" (Matt.
           6:10) and then, as true servants of Christ, do the will of God from
           the heart (Eph. 6:6).

             What will be the result when believers glorify God in their life
           and work? Matt. 5:16; Rom. 15:9.

             The effect of our life and work will be the same as Christ's:
           people will glorify God and put their faith in Him. There will
           also be others who will be annoyed and reject Christ, thinking it
           foolish to attribute their life and health and everything else to
           God. (See Acts 17:25, 28; Rom. 1:20-23.) But the result of that
           rejection of God will be that they will be "filled with all manner of
           wickedness, evil, covetousness, malice" (Rom. 1:29, RSV).
           When this separation between those who glorify God and those
           who boast in their own achievements beomes complete, the Lord
           will return. The call to honor and glorify God is a work to which
           God has called His church in these last days. (See Rev. 14:6, 7.)

             In which ways do I glorify God in my life and thought and work?
           (Read Rom. 6:11-14.)

OF SERVICE
                Jesus' life on earth centered in glorifying God and in serving
              His neighbor. In fact, these two are inseparable. He who loves
              God also loves his brother. And we serve God by serving our
              neighbor. (See 1 John 4:13-21; Matt. 25:31-46.)

                What do the following passages teach us about the purpose of Je-
              sus' life? Matt. 4:23-25; Luke 8:1-3. (See also Acts 10:38.)

                Christ found His fulfillment in life, not in being served, but in
              serving others. His fellow human beings came first in His life! So
              much so that He took upon Himself our griefs and our sorrows;
              He was wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniq-
              uities (Isa. 53:4-6); He bore the penalty of our wrongdoings. Yes,
              He took upon Himself our diseases so that we might be healed;
              He chose death so that we might find life (Isa. 53:7-9; John 17:
              1-3). The cross, that great sign of His absolute surrender to the
              will of God, is at the same time the most powerful evidence of His
              love for His fellowmen. Christ's every thought and act showed
              that He lived for others. He even died for us. (See 2 Cor. 5:15;
              1 Thess. 5:10.)

                In what ways is Christ's ministry in the world an example for
              every believer? John 13:12-17; Phil. 2:5-11.

                Christ's acts of service can never be equaled by us. But we
              must develop the same attitude. At one time Jesus called a child
              and put it before His disciples, saying, Unless you change and
              become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of
              heaven (Matt. 18:1-4). On another occasion Jesus compared the
              way of the world with the principles of His kingdom. In the world
              the greatest are those with authority, power, and position. But
              not so among the believers. There the greatest is the one who
              serves the most. (See Luke 22:24-27; Matt. 23:11, 12.)

                Think of people in the world today who would need your service
              most. Are you ready to serve them? In what ways? What is actually
              hindering you from serving them?

                 "In His life and lessons, Christ has given a perfect exemplifica-
              tion of the unselfish ministry which has its origin in God. God
              does not live for Himself. By creating the world, and by uphold-
              ing all things, He is constantly ministering for others."—The De-
              sire of Ages, p. 649.

    Part 4      "He answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
LOVING MY    thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with
 NEIGHBOR    all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself. And he said unto him,
             Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live" (Luke
             10:27, 28).

               Love to God and to our neighbor is closely intertwined. We
             show our love to God by loving our neighbor. If a person says he
             loves God but hates his brother, he is a liar. (See 1 John 4:20, 21.)

               By what means do we express our love for our neighbor? Luke
             10:29-37; James 2:1-9; Matt. 25:31-46.

                "In the story of the good Samaritan, Christ illustrates the na-
             ture of true religion. He shows that it consists not in systems,
             creeds, or rites, but in the performance of loving deeds, in bring-
             ing the greatest good to others, in genuine goodness."—The De-
             sire of Ages, p. 497.

               What should be the basis of our life of service in the world? 2 Cor.
             5:14-18; 1 John 4:19-21.

               Christian service, though it may outwardly at times resemble
             the work of other service agencies, is rooted in the sacrifice of
             Jesus Christ. His love leaves us no other choice. But without that
             love as the motivating factor all our service is of little value. "If I
             give away all I have, and if I deliver my body to be burned, but
             have not love, I gain nothing" (1 Cor. 13:3, RSV). In a message
             that carries symbolic significance, the Lord spoke of the many
             good works of the believers of the church at Ephesus. But He
             rebuked them for having lost the love they had at first. So God
             warned them to repent and do the same works, but now rooted in
             love. (See Rev. 2:1-5.)

               What is the relationship between the proclamation of the gospel
             and Christian service? Can the one bear fruit without the other?

               "The work of gathering in the needy, the oppressed, the suf-
             fering, the destitute, is the very work which every church that
             believes the truth for this time should long since have been doing.
             We are to show the tender sympathy of the Samaritan in sup-
             plying physical necessities, feeding the hungry, bringing the poor
             that are cast out to our homes, gathering from God every day
             grace and strength that will enable us to reach to the very depths
             of human misery and help those who cannot possibly help them-
             selves."—Testimonies, vol. 6, p. 276.

       Part 5     "Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there
M THE POWER     was a great calm. But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of
      OF GOD    man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!" (Matt. 8:26,
                27).

                   Indeed, what sort of man is this? It is important to stress here
                that Jesus did not calm the waves and quiet the winds in the
                power of His innate divinity. He had laid that aside. Jesus' power
                in the world—whether of nature or of man—was the power of
                God in response to His request as a man. It is a power, therefore,
                which God may entrust to any believer who puts his whole trust in
                God as Jesus did. "It was not as the 'Master of earth and sea and
                sky' that He reposed in quiet. That power He had laid down,
                and He says, 'I can of Mine own self do nothing.' John 5:30. He
                trusted in the Father's might. It was in faith—faith in God's
                love and care—that Jesus rested, and the power of that word
                which stilled the storm was the power of God."—The Desire of
                Ages, p. 336.

                  What promise is there that believers may have the kind of power
                that Jesus had in His day? Mark 16:16-20; Matt. 17:14-21.

                   The question is important for a number of reasons. If we
                would, we could indeed become reflections of what Jesus was in
                human flesh. By the aid of the Spirit, we could overcome even our
                hereditary tendencies. (See The Desire of Ages, p. 671; The Min-
                istry of Healing, p. 175.) Instead of their controlling us, we could
                keep them under control and change them. (See Ellen G. White
                Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 4, p. 1138; vol. 6, p.
                1101; Christ's Object Lessons, p. 315; Testimonies to Ministers,
                p. 259.) If we would, the effect of our collective lives in this world
                could have a much wider extent even than Jesus' own work, as
                He said it would. (See John 14:12; The Desire of Ages, p. 664.)
                   Scripture affirms that we could indeed have the power to resist
                evil. (See 1 John 3:9, 10.)But if we fail to do so, it is because we
                do not exercise the gift of faith. (See Matt. 17:14-20.) As Ellen
                White once wrote so powerfully, "He (Christ) came to the world
                to display the glory of God, that man might be uplifted by its re-
                storing power. God was manifested in Him that He might be
                manifested in them. Jesus revealed no qualities, and exercised no
                powers, that men may not have through faith in Him. His perfect
                humanity is that which all His followers may possess, if they will
                be in subjection to God as He was."—The Desire of Ages, p. 664.

                  By what means and to what extent may we exercise the power
                that Christ revealed?

      Part 6   "But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form
  MISSION AS of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: and being found
INCARNATION in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto
             death, even the death of the cross" (Phil. 2:7, 8).

                 Christ came to reveal to the world the true nature of God as our
               Father. He came to bring about reconciliation and restoration
               and to make an end to sin, death, and the devil. And He did so by
               taking the form of a human being, by becoming one with the peo-
               ple whom He was seeking to save, by identifying with the world,
               and by participating in its life and activities. From Christ's ex-
               ample we learn, therefore, that all mission must continue by His
               followers' becoming one with those to whom they have been sent,
               identifying with their deepest needs, and participating in their
               daily activities in order to claim them for Christ. The "mission-
               ary identification" has always a double aspect: (1) Christ living in
               us (Gal. 2:20), for without Him we can do nothing (John 15:4-6);
               and (2) we become one with the people to whom we have been
               sent as His representatives.

                 In what ways did the apostle Paul relate to people in order to
               reach them with the gospel? 1 Cor. 9:19-23.

                 Our world is a mosaic of different cultures and societies, races
               and religions, economic and political ideologies, classes and com-
               munities. And all of them are constantly changing. Would this
               mean, then, that different methods of labor and a variety of forms
               of communicating the message should be devised, which must
               also constantly change? Yes! We must "realize the necessity of
               adapting . . . to circumstances, and meeting the people where
               they are." —Gospel Workers, p. 381.

                   By the parable of the four kinds of soil, Jesus illustrated the need
                to make a careful study of the world into which we are sent with the
                gospel in order to plan and prepare for a rich harvest of souls. Read
                Matt. 13:3-9, 18-23.

                  In what ways does the need to identify with people of different
                cultures, times, societies affect the way we preach the message?

                  The church has always faced the challenge of adapting its
                message to the changing times and places in which it has worked.
                One great difficulty is to adapt the message without basically
                changing the message. Nearly every major step that has diluted
                the authority of the Bible has started out as an attempt to make it
                mean more to a particular time or people.

The Gospel an
Culture
  "After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude which no man could
number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood be-
fore the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and
palms in their hands" (Rev. 7:9).

   Our world is composed of vastly different cultures. At the second
coming of Christ people from these diverse cultures will bless their
Lord, shouting, "Salvation to our God" (Rev. 7:10). Christians are both
a channel and a reflection of this experience of unity in diversity.
   To accomplish this experience to its fullest extent, the church
needs to understand the meaning of culture, the relationship of culture
to the life of the church and the spread of the gospel. The last part of
last week's lesson made us aware of the fact that, in order to reach peo-
ple with the gospel of Christ, methods of labor and ways of communica-
tion must be developed which will meet this great diversity of cultures
in the world. Second, we learned that the message itself should be
shaped to meet the particular needs and circumstances in which people
find themselves (Gospel Workers, p. 330). This does not mean, of
course, that there is no absolute truth. There most certainly is. But
much of the truth as it is in Christ Jesus comes to us in the particular
forms and expressions of human cultures. This week's lesson is ex-
ploring this issue further: What is culture? How does it affect a person's
life and religious experience? In which ways does culture shape the
church's message and mission? What effects does culture change have
on the church? How can the church maintain unity amidst the diversity
of cultures represented by its believers around the world?
   Before we turn to the Word of God for some answers and guidelines
on these questions, we need first to settle on the following comprehen-
sive definition of culture: Culture is the way a particular group of people
thinks, feels, expresses itself, behaves, and arranges its whole life and
existence. Culture is people's design for living. Culture is what makes
us the persons we are in human society. It is the framework, also, in
which the gospel reaches us—in which it must express itself and bear
fruit. It is a source both of strength and of conflict, a vehicle and an
obstacle to the gospel and the believer's growth in truth and in Christian
maturity.

   Part 1     "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our like-
  MAN, A    ness: and let him have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over
CULTURAL    the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and
   BEING    over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth" (Gen.
            1:26).

              What is there in man that enables him to control the world and
            to create his own environment? He has tamed wild beasts and
            domesticated wild plants. He has made dry land where there was
            water and turned deserts into green valleys. He has left his foot-
            prints on the moon and probed the secrets of distant planets.
            What is there in man that enables him to accomplish such feats?
            In physical strength he is not nearly so powerful as the animals he
            tames. His body is not nearly so well adapted to the extremes of
            heat and cold as are those of certain animals. Exposed to the
            burning sun or to severe cold, he has no natural protection. The
            human infant is among the most helpless beings among the
            mammals, incapable of survival by itself. The answer to this
            question lies in the biblical account of the creation of man "in the
            image of God." Man has been endowed by God with powers akin
            to His own. (See Education, p. 17.) This endowment is seen in
            his capacity to think, to contemplate, and to communicate his
            thoughts through speech, writing, gestures, art, and symbols. It is
            seen in his ability to remember his experiences and to project
            them into the future, to imagine and to invent, to respond to his
            environment and to change it, to build and to explore, and to or-
            ganize and to develop.

              Why was man's right to control the earth and to shape it lost after
            the Fall? Eccl. 7:29; Gen. 6:5, 6; Mark 7:21-23.

               Since the Fall all human work, thought, action, and behavior
            is permeated with evil. The image of God in man has been dis-
            torted, but it has not been destroyed. Man still has the power to
            control the earth and to make his own environment. That con-
            trol is now marred, however, by harshness and selfishness. His
            social, economic, and physical environment is corrupted and pol-
            luted. Man is still—and always will be—a cultural being, that is,
            the creator of culture and a product of it.

      Part 2     "And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off
   MESSAGE     thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground" (Ex.
IM CULTURE     3:5).

                 Man was made to glorify God (Isa. 43:7; Col. 1:16) and to wor-
               ship Him (Rev. 14:7). The ways in which we express awe in
               worship are very much determined by our culture. In large parts
               of the Near and Far East taking off one's shoes is the most ap-
               propriate way of expressing awe before God. In other cultures,
               however, it is expressed by bowing the head, folding the hands,
               covering the head, kneeling, closing the eyes, or lifting up the
               hands.

                 What biblical modes of expressing awe, joy, praise, or fellowship
               can you think of which differ from those in your own culture? (For
               examples, see 1 Cor. 16:20; 1 Thess. 5:26; 1 Peter 5:14; 1 Sam. 18:6;
               2 Sam. 6:12-14; Ps. 150:4, 5; Eccl. 3:4.)

                 Why don't we express our praises and gratitude to God by
               dancing? Why can we not? Or why do we not greet each other in
               our churches with a holy kiss? Let us first consider that both the
               dance and the kiss have particular meanings and connotations in
               many modern cultures which differ from those in Bible times.

                 In this light, what would be the meaning of 1 Corinthians 11:4-16
               and 14:33-35? (Compare 1 Tim. 2:11, 12.)

                  As was the case with Moses whom God told to take off his
               shoes, so also with Paul's injunctions to women to cover their
               head and to be silent in the churches—these must be understood
               in the context of the particular culture of those days. Does this
               mean, then, that God's Word comes to us in the forms, expres-
               sions, and customs of particular cultures? Definitely so! For in
               order to be understood by men, God's Word must be expressed in
               human forms and symbols that belong to the particular culture in
               which people live. There are several consequences of this in-
               sight: (1) When God's Word is communicated to people of other
               cultures, it must be "translated" into forms and expressions
               which are meaningful to them. (2) Certain passages of the biblical
               message must find different applications in different cultures. (3)
               When cultures change, not the principle, but the application of
               the biblical message may also have to change.

                Give some examples of expressions or applications of the biblical
               message that have changed in your own culture.

       Part 3     "Certain men which came down from Judaea taught the breth-
     MISSION    ren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses,
AND CULTURE     ye cannot be saved" (Acts 15:1).

                   Religious practices and beliefs are part of the culture in which
                they arose and developed. Religion itself is not a product of cul-
                ture, for God is above culture. At the same time, however, the
                expressions of our religious beliefs and experience are very much
                formed and shaped by our social, physical, and intellectual envi-
                ronment. In the same way as the Bible came to us in human dress,
                so also religion reflects the culture in which it arose and devel-
                oped. Circumcision, for example, was not practiced by Israel
                only. God gave it special meaning for them. When a church—
                which, like its Head and Founder, has clearly a human and a
                divine aspect—moves across its own cultural boundaries, the
                question arises: Which part of its beliefs and practices are cul-
                tural, and need not be—or should not be—required of people of
                other cultures? and which part constitutes the absolute in the di-
                 vine revelation and is essential to people of all cultures?

                  How was the Antioch problem resolved relating to circumcision?
                Acts 15:1, 2, 22-31. (Compare with Gal. 2:11-14.)

                   The issue in the church in Antioch is as relevant today as it
                was then. The Seventh-day Adventist Church arose and devel-
                oped in the context of the North American culture of the nine-
                teenth century. It was God's choice to reveal Himself in that par-
                ticular context. But, as in earlier times, God's church adopted
                thereby forms and practices which were peculiar to the American
                culture of that time. When Adventist missionaries went to Eu-
                rope, and then to Africa and Australia, to Latin America, Asia,
                and Oceania, they carried the advent message with them in the
                particular forms and expressions of their own culture. Unawares,
                they thereby introduced certain practices and beliefs which were
                 very relevant and meaningful in the context of their own culture
                 but not in the cultures of these other continents. As Ellen White
                 wrote to workers in foreign missions, "The worker in foreign
                fields will come in contact with all classes of people and all
                 varieties of minds, and he will find that different methods of labor
                 are required to meet the needs of the people."—Gospel Workers,
                 p. 468.

                   By what criteria do we know which part of our religion is cultural
                 —and therefore relative—and which part is absolute and therefore
                 essential to people of all cultures at all times?

   Part 4      "Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we
CULTURE     all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth"
 CHANGE     (1 Cor. 8:1).

               It is necessary to raise the question here: Why didn't the apos-
            tle Paul in his later work stick to the ruling of the Council of Jeru-
            salem? One of the demands of that Council to the Gentiles was
            "to abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols" (Acts 15:29,
            RSV). Although retaining brotherly love and respect for the scru-
            ples of others, the apostle clearly permits the Corinthians to devi-
            ate from that "holy requirement" and suggests that it was all right
            to eat meat which had been offered to idols. For these idols, he
            argues, are nothing (1 Cor. 8:4). The same argument is used
            also in 1 Corinthians 10:18-33, where the apostle Paul suggests:
            "Eat whatever is sold in the meat market" (verse 25). Why this
            change?
               Although principles are changeless and always require respect,
            new circumstances had arisen, a new social situation and a differ-
            ent cultural context had developed which modified the applica-
            tion of the council's requirements. It was no longer applied in the
            same way to people living in this new situation. That demand of
            the council was still truth! Truth is not fixed by culture or cir-
            cumstance. But it was no longer present truth, that is, relevant to
            the particular social and cultural situation in which the recipients
            of Paul's letter found themselves. This means that certain prac-
            tices of the church may be changed when the church moves
            across cultural boundaries or finds itself in a situation which (radi-
            cally) differs from the church in previous generations. The
            church is not "subject to forms and rituals as expressive of its
            nature. . . . The true nature of Christianity is not in forms and
            ceremonies. The genius of Christianity is its spirituality, its
            worshiping of God in spirit and in truth. It was intended that
            Christianity should be freed as far as possible from forms and
            ceremonies."—S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 6, p. 320.

              Since conflicts and tensions over changes in form, ceremony, and
            religious requirement in the church are unavoidable, what biblical
            principle in the following passages can guide us to solve, or to live
            with, that tension? Rom. 14:10-13; 1 Cor. 8:9-13; Phil. 3:15, 16.

               Christian behavior should be governed by the principle to glo-
            rify God and to care for our neighbor. Certain practices may ap-
            pear to be good; but if they hurt our neighbor and become a stum-
            bling block to his faith and relationship with God, they become
            evil.

      Part 5     There is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the
:ONVERSION     same Lord overall is rich unto all that call upon him" (Rom. 10:12).
 ND CULTURE
                  It has often been contended that once people are converted,
               cultural distinctions between them cease to exist and that they are
               all members of one family, characterized by one and the same
               culture. In a sense that is true; for the same principles of the king-
               dom of God govern believers in Africa, Asia, the Americas, Eu-
               rope, and Oceania. The early Christians spoke of themselves,
               therefore, as constituting "a third culture," that is, neither Jew
               nor Greek, but adhering to a way of life and thought (culture) that
               was different from both—namely, a Christian culture.
                  On the other hand, however, we ought to recognize that cul-
               tures are essential to human life, thought, and organization.
               They are the design whereby people live and are part of God's
               good creation as well as a gift of His grace after the Flood. Bible
               passages indicate the following: (1) Our God is a universal God.
               He has no favorite culture; but people from all walks of life, eth-
               nic origin, nationality, religion, and ideology share equally in His
               love, grace, and righteousness (Rom. 3:22; 10:12; Gal. 3:26-28).
               (2) These cultural distinctions cease to be divisive among God's
               people. The distinctions themselves remain, and remain very
               meaningful. (See Galatians 3:28 where the distinction between
               male and female is put on the same line as that between Jew and
               Greek, employer and employee.) Among church members these
               distinctions are accepted and used to enrich each other and to
                build each other, to strengthen and correct each other.

                 From the following Bible passages, what would you conclude is
               the relationship between culture and conversion? Matt. 28:19, 20;
               Luke 3:10-14; 1 John 3:15-17; John 4:7-9.

                 Though the gospel remains the same, people's response must
               take on different forms and their commitment different expres-
               sions, according to the culture in which they live. In every culture
               there are elements that strengthen the demands of the gospel and
               help people to live a Christian life. But in every culture there are
               also elements that are in conflict with the gospel and the princi-
               ples of the kingdom of God. Such elements must be given up and
               overcome. We might say that Christ, though above culture, is in
               every culture, and at the same time against every culture. In ev-
               ery culture, therefore, conversion takes different forms and bears
               different "fruit."

                 In what ways is the church part of my culture? What elements in
                my culture contradict the principles of the kingdom of God?

    Part 6     "By one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be
  UNITY M    Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all
DIVERSITY    made to drink into one Spirit. For the body is not one member, but
             many" (1 Cor. 12:13, 14).

                The Seventh-day Adventist Church is established in some
             195 countries of the world. It embraces people of many different
             nations, kindreds, tongues, and cultures. What should be the rela-
             tionship between these Adventist churches in the diversity of cul-
             tures? From the biblical view of the church as one body, four
             important aspects emerge: (1) The church is not one culture,
             but many. (See Rom. 12:4, 5; 1 Cor. 12:13, 14.) Each has its own
             strengths and its own weaknesses. We ought to thank God for this
             cultural diversity in the church—for our own cultural heritage, as
             well as for that of other believers. (2) Each of these cultural tradi-
             tions is equal before God. None is favored by Him over the other.
             They are all precious in His sight. Each is also full of sin and
             evil, and in need of change. (3) People of different cultures need
             each other to correct, to help, to build, and to strengthen each
             other. (4) Though members of the church are different because
             of their cultural heritage and different functions, in Christ they are
             all one. No church can claim to be "the" church. Only in their
             togetherness do these member churches constitute the one holy,
             universal, and apostolic church.

               What does the illustration of the vine teach about oneness and
             diversity in Christ's church? John 15:1-11.

                "The connection of the branches with one another and with
             the Vine constitute them a unity, but this does not mean uniform-
             ity in everything. Unity in diversity is a principle that pervades
             the whole creation. . . . Christian unity consists in the branches
             being in the same parent stock, the vitalizing power of the center
             supporting the grafts that have united to the Vine. In thoughts and
             desires, in words and actions, there must be an identity with
             Christ, a constant partaking of His spiritual life."—Ellen G.
             White Comments, S.D.A. Bible Commentary, vol. 5, p. 1143.

               In what ways can the church best stimulate unity among the rich
             cultural diversity of its believers?

               "God has designed the web, and all are the individual threads
             to compose the pattern. The Creator is one, and He reveals
             Himself as the great Reservoir of all that is essential for each sep-

  "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are
passed away; behold, all things are become new" (2 Cor. 5:17).

   The Seventh-day Adventist Church is a world-wide communion of
faith. The social issues with which it is confronted differ from area to
area. But, even though the issues chosen for this week's lesson are of
greater significance in some areas than in others, they do remind con-
gregations everywhere that social issues confronting the church should
be taken seriously and be dealt with in the light of the Word of God.
   The first issue, abortion, is a social problem in some countries, but
much less in others. In quite a number of countries in the world, abor-
tion is legal, free for all women who want it, and in some cases, even
required by law. In other countries it is still illegal, or partly so.
Adventists, and Adventist women in particular, should not be guided in
this issue merely by whether it is legal or not. The greater question is
whether it is moral and acceptable in the eyes of God!
   Gambling, the second issue chosen for this week's lesson, takes
many different forms and shapes, from betting to bingo. Sometimes it is
connected with sports, sometimes with purely charitable institutions.
The issue is not the races or the places, but the act of gambling itself.
   Race relations have created problems in societies everywhere, from
ancient times until the present. They are also very much an issue in
 the church itself. It is imperative, however, that from the very start of
 our study we apply the principles involved to all relations between peo-
 ple of different origin or background, whether of nation, caste, class, or
 race. In human society race relations are never determined by biologi-
 cal factors alone, but also by economic status and cultural background.
 Prejudice has a wider connotation than merely racial prejudice.
    Finally, the status of women in society and the relations between
 male and female are issues that affect the life and the work of the
 church in many ways. May these lessons help us to become more one—

   Part 1        "Thou didst form my inward parts,
ABORTION         thou didst knit me together in my mother's womb."
                 "Thy eyes beheld my unformed substance;
                 in thy book were written, every one of them,
                 the days that were formed for me,
                 when as yet there was none of them" (Ps. 139:13, 16, RSV).

               Children are a gift from the Lord (Ps. 127:3). He gives to every
            new person life and all of its necessities (Acts 17:25) from the mo-
            ment of conception. Life is a divine gift. The Bible often speaks
            of the conception of a child as a revelation of God's power and
            grace. (See Gen. 15:1-4; 25:21; 1 Sam. 1:11.) God said to Jere-
            miah, "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before
            thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I or-
            dained thee a prophet unto the nations" (Jer. 1:5). Very power-
            fully is this expressed also in the biblical story of the conception
            of John the Baptist (Luke 1:13-17). One should not look upon
            these examples of prenatal dignity and calling as exceptions.
            They teach us that God Himself is the Giver of life and of hu-
            man personhood, which should therefore be held sacred and
            treated with awe and respect.

              In this light, how should the believer view abortion?

               The Bible does not give any direct counsel in regard to abor-
            tion. The Seventh-day Adventist Church has, as yet, taken no
            formal theological position on the subject. The Adventist Chris-
            tian, then, must seek out and apply any principles that the Bible
            gives about the sacredness of human life and decide upon a view
            of abortion in harmony with those principles. This is the same
            way that Christians conclude that it is wrong to smoke tobacco or
            use heroine. Early Christian writers considered abortion to be
            homicide. This was a general attitude in the world until the
            twentieth century, when the development of medicine and chang-
            ing laws in some places and countries made abortion quite easily
            available to many.
               In some countries it is the overpopulation which threatens
            many with hunger and a lowering of the living standard; in other
            areas, great emphasis is laid upon the protection of a woman's
            freedom and on her personal right to decide whether to carry the
            child or not. Another reason why some favor legalizing abortion
            is the physical and mental well-being of the mother and child: for
            example, threat to the mother's life or potential deformities or
            mental retardation of the child. Finally, social reasons such as
            unwanted pregnancy, or when conception has occurred as a re-
            sult of rape or incest, or when the mother is under a certain age,
            or unwed, or when the pregnancy or birth might be a burden.

   Part 2     "You who forsake the Lord,
GAMBLING      who forget my holy mountain,
              who set a table for Fortune
              and fill cups of mixed wine for Destiny;
              I will destine you to the sword" (Isa. 65:11, 12, RSV).

               The Christian will have a loving concern for fellow beings. In
            gambling, a person seeks to benefit himself at the expense of an-
            other. That is perhaps the main reason why Christians should
            not gamble. It is unloving and against the principle on which the
            Ten Commandments are based. Paul wrote: "Love worketh no
            ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law"
            (Rom. 13:10). All other evils connected with gambling are rooted
            in the failure to love.

              What is wrong with gambling? What principles do these texts
            provide on which to make a decision? Isa. 65:11, 12; Ex. 20:17;
            1 Thess. 4:11, 12; 1 Tim. 6:6-10.

               Some of the basic elements of gambling are these: artificial risk
            (unlike the natural risks of life); profit for which one has not
            worked; gain at somebody else's expense. What's wrong with
            gambling? It violates such divine commandments as those found
            in Exodus 20:17 and Leviticus 19:13. It is the opposite of the bibli-
            cal counsel to work for one's own living (2 Thess. 3:10, 12 etc.).
            Gambling is habit-forming; it is as compulsive a power as alcohol
            and drugs and puts the gambler into bondage. (See 1 Cor. 6:12;
            Gal. 4:8, 9.) It thereby robs him of peace and honor to say nothing
            of the harm it can do to his faith, hope, family, home, career and
            future.

               What could the church do to help people—believers and unbe-
            lievers—to overcome a habit of gambling?

              (1) As a church, avoid organizing raffles, lotteries, bingo, prize
            packages, and other chance games at all cost. (See The Great
            Controversy, p. 387.) (2) Train counselors to help gamblers to
            overcome the habit and to win them to Christ. (See Evangelism,
            pp. 267, 268, 288, 289.) (3) Prepare materials to educate people,
            especially the youth, concerning the dangers of gambling.

     Part 3        What does the Bible say concerning the origin of all races?
      RACE
ELATIOIIS-1     "Hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the
              face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed,
              and the bounds of their habitation" (Acts 17:26).

                 The most powerful message of Scripture concerning the di-
              verse groups within mankind speaks of the basic biological relat-
              edness of all human beings (Gen. 3:20; 10:32). Science confirms
              this with overwhelming evidence: Human beings everywhere are
              biologically 99.9 percent more alike than they are different. And
              these differences are biologically the least important. This just
              shows how far adrift we are in attaching so much value to such
              minor differences as the color of a person's skin or the texture of
              his hair. It also points up that when we speak of racial differences
              in man—and of race relations—we actually are referring to social,
              economic, and cultural differences more than to biological differ-
              ences.
                 We know that differences among people belonging to the same
              race are sometimes as great as those between people of different
              races. And there is no definite relationship between the biological
              and the cultural differences in man. It is not right, therefore, to
              speak of superior or more intelligent or more industrious races. In
              origin and in potentiality we are all the same. For all relations
              between people of different backgrounds, and for the spread of
              the gospel, this is of utmost importance.

                How close does the Bible come to giving any indication of how the
              biological differences between people may have come into exis-
              tence? Gen. 11:1-9; Acts 17:26, 27.

                 For a limited understanding of these biological differences
              we must turn to science. However, the Bible does have an im-
              plied message concerning the problems we face in race rela-
              tions—(1) racial differences are included in the evidence of God's
              grace, not in a curse; (2) all races are equal in His sight; (3) each
              race will bring its honor and glory into the city of God. (See Rev.
              21:24, 26.)
                 Four basic factors have had some part in the development of
              different racial groups in man: (1) the isolation of one group from
              another; (2) inbreeding among people of the same language group;
              (3) limited adaptation to the physical environment; and (4) cul-
              tural selectivity, whereby some groups of people preferred cer-
              tain physical characteristics in their marriage partners. Without
              claiming special insights, we would suggest that God had fore-
              knowledge of the intrusion of sin and the harsh physical environ-
              ments that would result. He therefore created man with the po-
              tential to adapt to these consequences of sin.

     Part 4     What positive value does the Bible attach to the different races?
      RACE
ELATIONS-2      "They sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the
              book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast
              redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue,
              and people, and nation; and hast made us unto our God kings and
              priests: and we shall reign on the earth" (Rev. 5:9, 10).

                The new earth will be populated by people of different races.
              And what on this earth may have been experienced as a problem
              will on the new earth be turned into happiness and honor. For
              there the glory and honor belonging to each race will be fully rec-
              ognized and appreciated.

                How should we understand Genesis 9:24-27?

                 The story of the blessing of Shem and Japheth, and the curse
              pronounced upon Canaan, has been terribly abused in the past.
              The misinterpretation of these texts had even been used as a
              theological foundation for the oppression and exploitation of
              black people by whites—a justification of the horrible slave trade.
              Some myths and fables created by this misinterpretation are still
              lingering on, even in the minds of some Christians. Myth 1: Ham
              is the ancestor of the black races. The peoples south of the Sa-
              hara are not even mentioned in the table of nations in Genesis 10.
              And even though there may be some black people among the de-
              scendants of Ham, there are also white peoples that can be con-
              sidered Hamites. Myth 2: The Hamites were cursed. The text
              clearly states that Canaan was cursed. Canaan was a son of Ham.
              His descendants, however, speak a semitic language. And among
              these descendants are people who are clearly classified among the
              Caucasoid race! Myth 3: All the descendants of an evil father are
              also evil and must therefore carry the guilt forever. This is the
              most unbiblical thought of all! Hereditary factors apart, if the Ca-
              naanites are punished with servitude and bondage, it is not be-
              cause of their father's or grandfather's sin, but because of their
              own. (See Gen. 15:16.) Moreover, in Scripture, grace is always
              the final word. Myth 4: The exploitation and oppression of
               some people could even be a result of a divine blessing. Can there
               be a greater sin than attributing to God what is the work of the
               devil? (See Matt. 12:24-32.) Myth 5: Some races would be better
               than others. All races share equally in God's grace because they
               also equally share in evil, guilt, and sin. (See Rom. 3:1-18.)

                How could we best make up for the harm done to people of other
              races? How can we overcome our own prejudices?

      Part 5        What is the Christian answer to the problem of race relations?
       RACE
1ELATIONS-3      "Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea,
               though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth
               know we him no more. Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a
               new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are be-
               come new" (2 Cor. 5:16, 17).

                  Of all prejudices, racial prejudice seems the most difficult to
               overcome. Racial prejudice, also, is the most widespread. It oc-
               curs among people of all races, from the most ancient times until
               the present. What is prejudice? What are some of its basic
               causes? Prejudice is an attitude with an emotional bias. It can also
               mean jumping to conclusions before considering facts.
                  Prejudice goes back to two main sources: external and internal.
               On the one hand we know that prejudice, like all aspects of human
               culture and behavior, is learned. It is part of our social heritage.
               Once it is learned at home, in the group with which we associate,
               it feeds upon selected facts from our social and economic envi-
               ronment to prove that we are right. On the other hand, we are also
               aware of some internal causes of prejudice: human egotism, fear
               (including the fear of losing power or position), selfishness, and
               aggressive tendencies; further, the need to belong and the need
               for identity, which often express themselves in a rejection of oth-
               ers. (Physical differences make these social differences more
               clearly identifiable.) There is also the tendency in man to judge
               others by one or a few characteristics only, and then the worst of
               them. Stereotyping is overlooking the fact that there are good and
               bad persons in every race and that each of us has weak and strong
               points.

                 What is the biblical way of viewing other people? Phil. 2:1-5;
               Luke 10:25-37.

                  Though we have known the example of Christ whom we are
               called to follow and though we have heard His admonitions to
               love our neighbors and to respect them, we continue to struggle
               with our prejudices. What can we do about them? Ministers,
               teachers, and all other church workers must lead the way in seek-
               ing the power of the Spirit for victory over prejudice. Then they
               can teach the nature of and reasons for prejudice; present the
               facts concerning people of other races, classes, and cultures; and
               stimulate interracial fellowship.

   Part 6     "God created man in his own image, in the image of God created
MALE AND    he him; male and female created he them" (Gen. 1:27).
 FEMALE
               Man, made in the image of God, was created two persons. Gen-
            esis 5:1 and 2, RSV, states the same: "When God created man, he
            made him in the likeness of God. Male and female he created
            them." And then the inspired writer adds: "And named them
            Man [adam] when they were created." The Hebrew word adam
            (man) stands for male and female, for mankind. (Other words dis-
            tinguished man from woman.) It is not Adam alone that is man,
            but in their togetherness, as male and female, our first parents
            were called "man" (adam). The creation of Adam was not com-
            plete until he was united with Eve (Gen. 2:18; 1:31; 2:23). In this
            togetherness, this partnership, this oneness, our humanity is truly
            fulfilled and realized.

              What effect did sin have on this partnership between male and
            female? Gen. 3:7, 12, 16.

              The immediate result of the broken relationship with God
            was that the partnership between male and female was broken
            and distorted. Gone were the togetherness, the oneness, the
            equality, and the reciprocity between the two. In a sense they be-
            came strangers to each other. Gone were the communion be-
            tween them and the mutual trust. The woman's desire was now
            to go out toward her husband, who would rule over her. Reflected
            in this brokenness are the distortions that would characterize all
            relationships between male and female throughout the genera-
            tions. Even the best of our love relationships suffer from this hor-
            rible distortion as a result of man's broken relationship with God.
            Friendship and love still exist. But they tend to find their center
            in self, not in the other—to love the other because of the self, not
            as the self as Jesus taught us. It is I, my ego, which usually deter-
            mines the nature of the relationship between male and female, in-
            stead of the other way around. The result is that even in our
            loves and friendships we generally remain strangers.

              How is the brokenness in the relationship between male and fe-
            male reflected in your society? How in your own life? How can the
            true partnership and equality between male and female be restored
            according to Galatians 3:25-28?

               A restoration of the image of God implies a new level of respect
             between male and female, in the home, the church, and at work.

  "Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work" (Ex. 20:9).

   Work is essential to human life and to the fulfillment of our divine
calling. This biblical view of work differs greatly from that of the non-
Christian world. Many regard work merely as a necessity, even a curse.
In Scripture, however, work is part of the divine order of the world and
a God-given function of human life. "Man goeth forth unto his work and
to his labour until the evening" (Ps. 104:23).
   Sometimes we hear it said that work represents the legacy of the
curse of Adam. Nothing is farther from the truth. Work was already an
integral part of God's original intention when He created man in His
own image and then commissioned him to till the garden and to keep it.
(See Gen. 2:15.) After sin entered into the world, work, like everything
else in life, was negatively affected. But along with the hardship that
resulted from the Fall, work was appointed a blessing, offering man
healing, strength, happiness, and relief. (See Child Guidance, pp. 342-
349.) Work was part of God's plan for man's recovery from sin. (See
Counsels to Teachers, p. 274.) And it will forever be a delightful feature
of man's life on the new earth, when people will build houses and plant
vineyards. (See Isa. 65:21-23.)
   It is significant to remember that Jesus chose to be born into a work-
ing-class family, and that He Himself became an artisan and craftsman.
(See Mark 6:3.) Ultimately, all human work is rooted in God's own ac-
tivity. (See 2 Peter 1:3, 4.)
   In Scripture no distinction—let alone separation—is made between
mental work and physical labor. The notion that one aspect of man's
work—or that one kind of work—would be innately higher or better or
more important than another is totally foreign to biblical thinking.
   Though work is essential to all human life, growth, and develop-
ment, it is not the whole of it. Neither is it man's only important activ-
ity. As humans were created to share in the joy of their Creator in His
work, so were they created to share in His meditation and rest. (See
Gen. 2:1-3; Ex. 20:8-11; Heb. 4:4-10.)

    Part 1    "Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I
A WORKING    work" (John 5:17).
      GOD
               Our God is a working God. The whole universe is the work of
             the Godhead (Ps. 8:3, 6; 19:1, etc.). And after They had finished
             Their work of creation, the Godhead continued to be creatively
             at work in the world.

               What is the nature of the work of God? Ps. 33:13-19; Phil. 2:13.

                The whole Bible describes God as being actively and con-
             stantly at work for the sustenance of His creation (Heb. 1:3) and
             for the good of man and his salvation (Isa. 44:22, 23). He gives us
             life and breath and everything (Acts 17:25); He directs in the af-
             fairs of nations (Acts 17:26; Romans 13), draws men and women
             to Himself (John 12:32), liberates His people and builds His
             church (Eph. 2:18-22).

               In addition to His creative work, what special work does the Bible
             ascribe to Christ? Rom. 5:10, 11; Heb. 9:11; John 5:22; Rev. 19:16.

               The redemptive work of Jesus may be described under four
             main headings: His sacrifice, His priesthood (mediatorship), His
             judgment, and His kingship. All four aspects, of course, belong
             together and are inextricably intertwined.

               What clue might there be to Jesus' vocation in Mark 6:3 and Mat-
             thew 13:55, and what could it mean to our view of work?

                Jesus learned a trade and worked as a craftsman. Though this
             aspect of Jesus' work usually receives little attention, His partici-
             pation in physical work sheds a light on the biblical understand-
             ing of work. "By His own example He taught that it is our duty to
             be industrious, that our work should be performed with exactness
             and thoroughness, and that such labor is honorable. . . .
                 "Jesus is our example. There are many who dwell with inter-
             est upon the period of His public ministry, while they pass
             unnoticed the teaching of His early years. . . . He lived to
             please, honor, and glorify His Father in the common things of
             life. His work began in consecrating the lowly trade of the crafts-
             men who toil for their daily bread. He was doing God's service
             just as much when laboring at the carpenter's bench as when
             working miracles for the multitude."—The Desire of Ages, pp.
             72-74.

                In what ways have I been affected by the work of God in Christ?

     Part 2     "The Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of
  A DIVINE    Eden to dress it and to keep it" (Gen. 2:15).
ORDINANCE
                 Paradise was not a place where our first parents could spend
              their time in leisure and meditation only. It required work—con-
              stant mental and physical labor. This divine ordinance of work
              would forever remain an essential part of man's life and calling, a
              necessary ingredient for his growth and development. Work is a
              gift from God to man. As the image of God, humans are made in
              the image of the original Worker. Working men and women share
              in the nature of God.

                What are some of the purposes served by work? Eccl. 5:12. Com-
              pare with Ps. 128:2; Prov. 19:15; Eccl. 10:18.

                 Though work is necessary to satisfy our physical and mate-
              rial needs—such as food and shelter—the Bible asserts that work
              is essential to our happiness, understanding, and spiritual fulfill-
              ment. Without work, we cannot be what God wants us to be. Our
              whole personhood suffers.
                 "God appointed labor as a blessing to man, to occupy his mind,
              to strengthen his body, and to develop his faculties. . . . Our
              Creator, who understands what is for man's happiness, appointed
              Adam his work. The true joy of life is found only by the working
              men and women."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 50.

                   In what attitude is work to be done? Col. 3:22-24.

                 Only that work which is done to the glory of God will, in the
              end, prosper and bear fruit. Not the quantity of work—nor how it
              is evaluated by man—will determine its ultimate value, but
              whether the work was done to the honor of God.

                 If work really is as essential to human life and to the development
              of human personhood as the Bible says it is, what can Christians do
              to extol its virtues?

                "The Lord knew what was for man's happiness when He
              gave him work to do. The sentence that man must toil for his
              bread, and the promise of future happiness and glory, came from
              the same throne. Both are blessings."—Testimonies, vol. 2, pp.
              529, 530.

                                                                         August 10

     Part 3      "Unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice
THE EFFECT    of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee,
     OF SIN   saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in
              sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life" (Gen. 3:17).

                 As soon as our first parents had sinned, work took on a whole
              new form and significance. First, work became a hardship, a
              burden, partly because of man's weakened mental and physical
              strength, partly also because of the resistance offered by nature
              itself. Man lost his dominion. (See Gen. 1:26-28.) Second, work
              became self-directed and a goal in itself. It even began to control
              man, as the presence of many "workaholics" clearly indicates.
              Third, work—from a means to glorify God—turned into a
              means for self-aggrandizement and an instrument of human greed
              and sin. Fourth, for the first time, work became associated with
              failure, fear, and frustration.

                How deeply has sin affected human work? Eccl. 2:22, 23; Isa.
              44:13-17.

                 Every aspect of our work has been affected by sin, even the
              most beautiful work of art, the deepest thought, the holiest activ-
              ity. Only God is perfect. (See Ps. 18:30, 31.)

                What redeeming effect may work have in the God-fearing family
              and thus on the community, nation, and race? Prov. 22:29; 31:10-
              18.

                Though the original form of work in Eden has changed as a
              result of sin, work itself was not a part of the curse. It rather of-
              fered man relief from the effects of the curse. Neither was work,
              even in its harsh form, a punishment. It rather turned into a bless-
              ing. "The changed condition of the earth through the curse of
              sin has brought a change in the conditions of labor; yet though
              now attended with anxiety, weariness, and pain, it is still a source
              of happiness and development. And it is a safeguard against temp-
              tation. Its discipline places a check on self-indulgence, and pro-
              motes industry, purity, and firmness. Thus it becomes a part of
              God's great plan for our recovery from the Fall."—Education,
              p. 214.
                 "The life of toil and care which was henceforth to be man's
              lot was appointed in love. . . . It was a part of God's great plan
              for man's recovery from the ruin and degradation of sin."—Patri-

     Part 4   Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to
)011SIBILITY the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as
ND REWARD unto Christ; not with eyeservice, as manpleasers; but as the ser-
            vants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart." (Eph.
            6:5, 6).

                In a number of significant passages, the New Testament
             deals with the relationships between workers (employees) and
             masters (employers). These instructions to household members
             (Eph. 6:5-9; Col. 3:22; 4:1; 1 Tim. 6:1, 2; Titus 2:9, 10; and
             1 Peter 2:18, 19) emphasize that Christians are characterized by a
             very particular attitude toward work, based on their relationship
             to Christ. Thus, Christian employees do their assigned work
             "as unto Christ." And Christian employers treat their employees
             justly and fairly, knowing that they have a Master in heaven.

               What does the Bible teach about the responsibility of the worker
             (employee)? Col. 3:22-24; Titus 2:9, 10; 1 Peter 2:18-21.

                Although these passages speak about "slaves" and "servants"
             (douloi), one may see some parallels with "workers" or "em-
             ployees" today. The Christian, by his work, serves not only his
             employer, but also Christ. Therefore a Christian employee will
             work conscientiously and honestly, because he is responsible
             first to Christ. Such labor is in fact an adornment of God our Sav-
             iour (Titus 2:9, 10) and preserves the name of God and the truth
             from blasphemy (1 Tim. 6:1). Even if employers are harsh, they
             still have to be treated with "godly respect" (1 Peter 2:18).
             Christ's own suffering at the hand of man is held up as a model for
             Christian workers to follow. (See 1 Peter 2:21-24.)

                  How should employers treat their employees? Col. 4:1; Eph. 6:9.

               In dealing with their subordinates, Christian employers should
             realize that they are representing Christ to their workers. "How
             would Christ have acted?" is a question Christian employers
             must constantly ask themselves. The emphasis, as with the em-
             ployee, is not upon their rights, but upon their duties—pay just
             wages, treat people fairly, don't take advantage of them. (See
             James 5:4.)

               Scripture does not give us any detailed guidelines concerning the
             often complicated and perplexing labor relations in our modern in-
             dustrial society. How, then, do these counsels of Scripture apply to
             the problem of work in the modern world?

                                                                      August 12

   Part 5     "Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not ac-
WORK AND    cording to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace,
VOCATION    which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began" (2 Tim.
            1:9).

               In the New Testament the word "vocation" (Latin: vocatio;
            Greek: klesis "calling"; see Eph. 4:1, NIV) does not refer to a
            profession, a job, or an occupation, but to God's call to repen-
            tance and faith and to a life of fellowship and service in the
            church. The Scriptures do emphasize, however, that this call-
            ing must be reflected in our daily work. Our profession or occupa-
            tion becomes thereby an instrument and an expression of our call-
            ing to worship God, to love our neighbor, and to advance the
            work of God in all the world. Every believer who takes his calling
            seriously becomes thereby a co-worker with God, whatever his
            earthly occupation may be—a teacher, a carpenter, a secretary, a
            farmer, a minister, or a homemaker.

              What is the calling of every believer? 2 Cor. 5:14-20; Matt. 28:
            19, 20.

               "The Saviour's commission to the disciples included all the
            believers. It includes all believers in Christ to the end of time. It is
            a fatal mistake to suppose that the work of saving souls depends
            alone on the ordained minister. All to whom the heavenly inspira-
            tion has come are put in trust with the gospel. All who receive the
            life of Christ are ordained to work for the salvation of their fellow-
            men. For this work the church was established, and all who
            take upon themselves its sacred vows are thereby pledged to be
            co-workers with Christ."—The Desire of Ages, p. 822.

               In what way has Christ prepared every believer to be a co-worker
            of His? Rom. 12:3-8; 1 Cor. 12:4-11.

              Each believer, the apostle Paul assures us, has received a spe-
            cial gift—or gifts—of the Spirit. (See also Eph. 4:7-12.) Through
            these gifts, whether one works as a bricklayer, a schoolteacher, a
            lawyer, or a nurse, that the mission of God is accomplished and
            the church is built. As children of God, our first calling is that of a
            missionary. Our occupation is secondary, though not un-
            important; for through our calling it becomes a means in the ser-
            vice of God to establish His kingdom.

              In what ways can I serve Christ best in my daily work and occu-
            pation?

  Part 6   "Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh
  WORK, day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any
WORSHIP, work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy
AUD REST maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy
         gates" (Ex. 20:9, 10).

             It is of the utmost importance to realize that the divine ordi-
           nance of work appears in the Decalogue within the framework of
           keeping the Sabbath holy. The meaning is clear: (1) Though
           work is essential for the growth and development of human
           personhood, it is not the whole of it. In fact, it is not even man's
           most important activity on earth. Worship is! And the Sabbath
           reminds us that all our work must find its basis and its goal in
           glorifying God. (2) By keeping the Sabbath holy, man is in fact
           saying to God: "By myself I can do nothing. The work I have
           accomplished this week is not my own achievement; it is the re-
           sult of Thy power and grace working in me. I am only a stew-
           ard. My work was not done for my own glory, but as an act of
           worship to Thee."

              From the following texts, what would you conclude is the rela-
           tionship between work and worship? Col. 3:17; 1 Cor. 10:31.

             To the Christian, work and worship are not opposites—the
           one centering in man and his daily needs, the other in God and His
           sovereignty. Rather, every activity, every thought, every deed
           must be done in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the
           glory of God our Maker. We were made for His glory (Isa. 43:7),
           and all our work, done to the glory of God, becomes thereby an
           act of worship.

                What example has God given us concerning rest? Gen. 2:2, 3.

              Scripture abhors idleness. The hours of daylight were the
           hours of work for everyone. Poverty, hunger, evil thoughts and
           deeds, even sickness, were attributed to lack of work and
           idleness. Yet this "work ethic" was also clearly balanced by the
           social and religious institution of rest. Every seventh day was a
           day of rest. And besides the Sabbath, there were many holidays—
           religious and social festivals—spread through the year. (See Ex.
           23:14-17; 34:18-23; Numbers 28 and 29.) The Bible teaches us
           thereby that our life should be characterized by a rhythm of work
           and rest. And, like work, so also should our rest be to the glory of
           God and a foretaste of that eternal rest which the Lord has prom-
           ised. (See Heb. 4:4-10.)

God Loves T
Cities
  "Seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray
to the Lord on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare"
(Jer. 29:7, RSV).

   The world in which we live and work today is an urban world.
Some 60 percent of the world population—or 2640 million people—live
in cities. With the end near, they must hear an urgent call to repentance
and salvation.
   How should we as Christians live and work in this urban world of
ours? Many believers are of the opinion that the evil of the cities has
reached such proportions that Christians should not live there. Others
are of the opinion that the cities need the presence of true Adventist
believers in order to reach these hundreds of millions of people with the
gospel of Jesus Christ and to call them to repentance and conversion.
   Both views are genuinely biblical and rooted in the equivocal attitude
of Scripture toward the world in general, and toward the cities in par-
ticular. Cities are clearly seen in Scripture as symbols of evil and of
man's revolt against God. They are centers of human arrogance,
 pride, and immorality—for example, Sodom and Babylon. On the other
hand, the Bible also speaks of cities as symbols of God's presence and
peace, of refuge and salvation. Over against Babylon, a representation
of all that is evil, stands Jerusalem, the city of peace and the symbol of
 God's church and salvation. What the church needs today is that same
 open attitude toward the cities in order to win them to Christ. This
 attitude finds its highest expression in Jesus' weeping over Jerusalem.
 He loved the people of the city, as He loves the people of all the cities of
 the world. But He was pained by its evil and by the people's unwilling-
 ness to hear His word and to receive Him. On the one hand, therefore,
 we should shun the wickedness of the cities and flee from their evil in-
 fluence. But on the other hand, the love of Christ compels us to associ-
 ate with the cities in order to reach people with the gospel. For "in
 every city, filled though it may be with violence and crime, there are
 many who with proper teaching may learn to become followers of Je-
 sus."—Prophets and Kings, p. 277.

  Part 1     "And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose
  OFTEN    top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be
CENTERS    scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth" (Gen. 11:4).
 OF EVIL
             The first city mentioned in Scripture is Enoch, built by
           brother-murderer Cain (Gen. 4:17). It stands as a symbol of hu-
           man rebellion against God and of man's attempt to construct his
           own world in defiance of the will and purpose of God for him.
           The development of cities after the Flood confirms this view.
           First there was Babylon, clearly founded on human pride and
           arrogance, and in direct defiance of God's will. No wonder that
           throughout Scripture, Babylon stands as the symbol of confusion,
           pride, and revolt against God. Next comes Sodom, so wicked that
           there were not even 10 righteous people for whose sake God
           could have spared it. (See Genesis 18 and 19.) Though Sodom—
           along with Gomorrah—was totally annihilated, its name lives on
           today not only as a general synonym for depravity and perversity
           but also in a technical term for certain sexual aberrations.

             What sins permeated the cities in Bible days? Jer. 1:15, 16;
           32:26-29, 34, 35; Eze. 7:23; 9:9; Micah 3:9, 10.

              The word "city" appears in Scripture some 1300 times. In
           addition to these general references to the city, there are hun-
           dreds of references to specific cities. Best known among these are
           the warnings of the prophets Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Isaiah, urg-
           ing the cities—including Jerusalem—to change their evil ways or
           else expect total destruction. The prophetic utterances against
           the city in Scripture find their climax in the description of God's
           judgment over Babylon, the most wicked city of all, representing
           all human pride, greed, immorality, blasphemy, and evil, wher-
           ever it is found. (See Rev. 14:8; chapters 17 and 18.)

                What counsel to Lot can be applied to life today? Gen. 19:12-14.

             " 'Out of the cities, out of the cities!' . . . This is the mes-
           sage the Lord has been giving me. . . . We are not to establish
           ourselves in the wicked cities, where the enemy is served in every
           way, and where God is so often forgotten."—Life Sketches, pp.
           409,410.

              Are evil and sinfulness limited to the cities of the world? Is it the
           place, or is it primarily the evil we have to shun and come away
           from? What would be a reason for believers to stay in these wicked
           cities?

     Part 2      "Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites
SYMBOLS OF    of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall
REDEMPTION    give also unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them."
                 "And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites there
              shall be six cities of refuge" (Num. 35:2, 6).

                The Lord Himself told Moses to prepare 48 cities for the Le-
              vites to dwell in (Num. 35:1-8). Among these there were six cities
              of refuge where persons guilty or accused of manslaughter might
              flee and be safe until they could get a fair hearing. (See Num.
              35:9-15; Deut. 4:41-45; Joshua 20.) These cities were for the
              Israelites and for foreigners. They were so located, upon the
              command of God, that nobody needed to travel more than 30
              miles in order to reach a city of refuge.
                 Cities of refuge are not symbols of evil but rather centers of
              God's mercy and justice. They were not founded upon human
              arrogance and pride but upon the command of the Lord, who de-
              signed that His special people, the Levites, should have these
              cities in which to live.

                What positive aspects of the city are extolled by these scriptures?
              Ps. 107:4-8; 122:3-7; Eze. 48:35.

                 The Bible is just as positive about the city as it is negative. On
              the one hand, cities are described as symbols of evil; but on the
              other hand, the place where God dwelt was a city, and it was in
              cities that people were to find refuge and redemption, safety, and
              salvation. Over against Babylon, the mother of all wickedness
              and immorality, stands Jerusalem, the city of peace, symbol of
              God's mercy and righteousness. It is interesting that salvation in
              Scripture has place for a city—a huge city at that—namely, the
              New Jerusalem, which, adorned as a bride, will become the cen-
              ter of the new earth. It is, of course, God's perfect city. It will be
              the center of the new earth where God dwells to receive the glory
              and honor of the nations. (See Rev. 21:24-26.) The beauty of
               Eden will be restored also, in the kingdom eternal.

                 In what ways do our cities today reflect both negative and positive
               aspects? Therefore, what should be our attitude toward these cities?

                 Although they intensify the problems of humanity, cities are
               centers of creativity and culture. In the ferment of the cities mod-
               ern man developed a sense of need for freedom and equality, and
               found new impulses for growth and development. In the cities we
               especially find the roots of religious liberty, social justice, and de-
               mocracy.

     Part 3     "The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this gen-
IBJECTS OF    eration and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jo-
GOD'S LOVE    nah, and now one greater than Jonah is here" (Luke 11:32, MV).

                The city of Nineveh was doomed (Nahum 3:5-7). And yet,
              like every other city on earth today, it was also the object of
              God's loving patience. The evidence of God's concern for
              Nineveh can be seen in the mission of Jonah, who thereby be-
              came a symbol of God's continuous concern for the cities on
              earth.

               What evils did Nahum say were in Nineveh, and what was God's
              message to them through Jonah? Nahum 3:1, 4; Jonah 3:1-4.

                 Nineveh was "an exceeding great city of three days' journey"
              (Jonah 3:3), and very old. It was a world metropolis, and ulti-
              mately capital of a powerful empire. Many considered it the most
              beautiful city on earth, famous for its parks and public buildings.
              Its wealth staggers our imagination, and its military strength made
              it look impregnable. But Nineveh's wealth invited divine judg-
              ment; for they had been gained by oppression, war, and plunder.
              The entire political and economic life of the city was based on
              taking from weaker nations and on slave labor. And besides,
              Nineveh was the mistress of witchcraft and a capital of vice. Her
              artistic achievements were fouled by obscenities, her rich culture
              by idols, and her beauty by violence. The prophet Nahum calls
              her a city of blood. In this situation, only the clearest prophetic
              message which revealed in an unmistakable manner the nature of
              their sin, the time in which they lived, and the judgment of God
              would shake people and lead them to repentance.

                What was Nineveh's response to Jonah's preaching? Jonah 3:
              5-10.

                 What particular lessons for our modern urban mission can we
              learn from Jonah's mission to Nineveh?

                Both the fact that Nineveh repented and the manner of repen-
              tance offer significant lessons. The first tells us that God is con-
              cerned about the cities, that He wants to see them saved. The
              second tells us that God accomplishes His work through human
              instruments whom He sends into the cities as witnesses of His
              grace and messengers of His judgment. And, as in the days of
              Jonah, the cities ought to be our first concern; for they are the
              centers of modern life and culture. That's where the people are
              whom God wants to save!

     Part 4     "Some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when
CENTERS OF    they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the
   MISSION    Lord Jesus. And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great
              number believed, and turned unto the Lord" (Acts 11:20, 21).

                Known as "Antioch the beautiful," this center of commerce,
              art, and culture, capital of Syria, and third city in the Roman Em-
              pire, was a meeting point for many nationalities and ethnic
              groups. It was also a center of many religious cults in the ancient
              world and at the same time was full of corruption and immorality.

                How did the church in Antioch begin, grow, and develop as a
              center of missionary outreach? Acts 11:19-30; 13:1-3.

                Like most of the churches of the first century, the one in Anti-
              och was founded by laymen. It was a "mixed church," consisting
              of different nationalities and races, Jews and non-Jews, lower-
              class and high-class people. The church was a reflection of the
              diversity and pluralism of this cosmopolitan city. This, really,
              became the basis for another important aspect of this big-city
              church; it became the center of missionary outreach into all the
              world. Here the apostle Paul received his training and preparation
              for mission service. Finally, church growth in the city of Anti-
              och centered in "preaching the Lord Jesus" (Acts 11:20).

                What lessons can we learn from the methods of church growth in
              the city of Antioch? (Reexamine Acts 11:22-30; 13:1-3.)

                 First, the work not only centered in preaching the Lord Je-
              sus; the believers also lived Jesus Christ. He was the Center of
              their whole life, thought, actions, and conversation. No wonder
              that it was in Antioch where the followers of Christ were first
              called Christians. People hearing and seeing them saw Christ.
              Second, the church continued as a lay movement. The role of
              apostles and pastors such as Barnabas and Paul was to assist the
              members in their role as ministers of Jesus Christ in the city (Eph.
              4:11,12). Third, ministry was carried out as teamwork, with
              prophets, pastors, teachers, administrators, relief workers, and
              evangelists working together. Fourth, the believers lived in the
              city where people could hear and observe them in their daily life
              and vocation. Even leaders such as Barnabas and Paul joined the
              believers and lived with them in the city. Fifth, the church was
              liberal in giving, with a deep concern for people other than their
              own. Sixth, it was a missionary church, a home base and a train-
              ing school for missionaries. Finally, all ministry was rooted in
              the work of the Holy Spirit.

  WORK IR    pray to the Lord on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your
THE CITIES   welfare" (Jer. 29:7, RSV).

                The cities of this earth are not our permanent home. We are
             looking forward to living in that great city "whose builder and
             maker is God" (Heb. 11:10), and therefore we are strangers and
             sojourners in our own cities. Yet, as long as we shall live on this
             earth, the Lord calls us to be His special people, sent to the cities
             to bear witness of His glorious name. To do so we must go into
             the cities and mingle with the people in their daily life and exis-
             tence as Christ did, and as the example of the believers in Antioch
             clearly teaches.
                "In every large city there should have been a strong force of
             workers laboring earnestly to warn the people. Had this been un-
             dertaken in humility and faith, Christ would have gone before the
             humble workers, and the salvation of God would have been re-
             vealed."—Medical Ministry, p. 302.
                "In every city there should be a city mission, that would be a
             training school for workers. Many of our brethren must stand
             condemned in the sight of God because they have not done the
             very work that God would have them do."—Medical Ministry, p.
             303.

                  What methods of labor should Christians use in the cities today?

                Our first mission is to pray for the welfare of the city (Jer. 29:7),
             much as Abraham prayed for the wicked city of Sodom (Gen.
             18:22-33)—prayers of intercession, prayers for peace, prayers
             that God may take away the evil forces operating in the cities,
             prayers for protection, prayers that God may open doors and re-
             move obstacles that obstruct His work of mission. Second, since
             the two greatest diseases of the modern city are loneliness and
             meaninglessness (confusion), our healing ministry should consist
             of establishing communions of faith where the lonely can find fel-
             lowship and the bewildered can find peace and a new meaning in
             life. Third, modern cities are marked by conflict—conflict be-
             tween employers and employees, rich and poor, different ethnic
             groups, young and older generations. In these conflicts Christians
             should act as agents of reconciliation (1) by being a model of rec-
             onciliation themselves, where high and low, black and white, em-
             ployers and employees, live, work and worship together; (2) by
             acting as intermediaries between conflicting groups in the cities.
             Our fourth mission is to uphold the righteousness of God as the
             basis of all peace. (See Isa. 32:16-18.)

                God Loves the Cities                                    8  Friday
                                                                        August 20

       Part 6     "Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ
OPPORTUNITY     unto them. And the people with one accord gave heed unto those
AMID DANGER     things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he
                did. . . . And there was great joy in that city" (Acts 8:5-8).

                   The early Christian church was a city movement. It was the
                cities of the ancient world which accepted Christianity first, not
                the country. The seven churches in Asia, which became sym-
                bols of the church throughout the ages, were all city churches.
                (See Revelation 2 and 3.) The Reformation, likewise, was a city
                movement; and so was the developed Millerite movement. In
                many countries of the world Adventism also (first) developed in
                the cities (small by comparison with present cities) where people
                were concerned with social and religious freedom, and where
                they were more open to change than those in the rural areas. It is
                precisely the presence of this openness to change, this personal
                freedom and differentiation of life—besides the intense need for
                fellowship, meaning, and reconciliation—that offer the church so
                many wide open doors for an effective ministry within the cities
                today. (See 1 Cor. 16:9; 2 Cor. 2:12.)

                  What are some of the dangers of living in the cities? Gen. 11:4-6;
                Dan. 4:28-30; Rev. 18:1-8.

                  Of all the dangers, from secularism, materialism, immorality,
                restlessness, pollution, criminality, conflicts, violence, and ma-
                nipulation, perhaps the greatest is the spirit of arrogance and
                pride. This spirit lies at the foundation of human city building.
                (See Gen. 4:17; 11:4). In the end this will be the cause of their
                ruin. For this reason Ellen White warned believers to get out of
                the cities and not to establish themselves in them. (See Life
                Sketches, pp. 409, 410.)

                   How should the church relate to the challenge of giving the gospel
                to the millions who live in the cities? Acts 8:40; 13:44.

                  Jesus included the cities and the countryside around them when
                He preached the message of the kingdom of God. And so did the
                apostles. More than any other, the apostle Paul has set an exam-
                ple for all modern missions to the cities of this world—preaching
                the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, bringing a message of recon-
                ciliation, dialoging with people of other faiths and ideologies, call-
                ing for conversion, establishing local churches, while living and
                identifying himself with the people whom he tried to reach. Cities
                are a significant part of the gospel target. (See Acts 1:8.)

   "For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be
joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mys-
tery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church" (Eph. 5:31, 32).

   Marriage is universal. Never has a society, however advanced or
primitive, been discovered that did not know marriage in one form or
another. Apparently, marriage is an essential part of our humanity; it
seems basic to the development of our personhood and to the formation
and continuation of human life and society. That explains why mar-
riage, in spite of all the attacks against this institution, has continued
and will continue.
   Marriage is a powerful symbol of the relationship of God to His peo-
ple and of Christ to His church. This meaning of marriage elevates all
other meanings, needs, and factors of marriage. This meaning of mar-
riage as a model of God's love to the world, and as a representation of
His relationship to His people, does not make the other meanings and
factors superfluous. Neither does it absorb them. It rather gives them a
new perspective, which makes Christian marriage so special.
   It is important to stress here that this meaning of marriage as a repre-
sentation of God's love to man is not just an addition to the economic,
social and psychological reasons for marriage. It is the very core of mar-
riage. If that meaning is lost, marriage is threatened with collapse.
This may be reflected in the reluctance of youth to wait for the stabi-
lizing elements of marriage before tasting of its intimate joys. It is cer-
tainly reflected in the spreading perversions and abuses of marriage it-
self. The other factors such as economic cooperation and depen-
dence, social status, companionship, and self-fulfillment may still give it
some basis of existence and continuity. But it is at best a rather shaky
existence, as the collapse of marriage in modern society clearly indi-
cates.
   The sanctity and redeeming value of Christian marriage provide
through it a happiness and a fulfillment which other marriages do not
have. It is the purpose of this week's lesson to evaluate both the special
qualities of marriage and the obligations of the Christian marriage.

               A Christian View of Marriage                            9   Sunday
                                                                         August 22

      Part 1      "From the beginning of the creation God made them male and
   A DIVINE    female. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and
INSTITUTION    cleave to his wife; and they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are
               no more twain, but one flesh" (Mark 10:6-8).

                Marriage goes back to the very beginning of time, even before
               Adam and Eve fell into sin. It was then sanctified and sealed by
               God as an institution which would last until its purpose and end
               would have been fulfilled.

                 For what reasons was marriage instituted by God? Gen. 2:18-24;
               1:26-28; 1 Cor. 7:2-5.

                  A comparison of the parallel passages of Genesis 1 and 2 indi-
               cates that the institution of marriage follows immediately after
               God's command to the man not to eat of the tree of knowledge of
               good and evil. Did God intend that Adam and Eve would help to
               keep each other loyal to Him and convinced of His love? One
               overriding aim of marriage is for partners to keep and to build
               each other in the faith, and to deepen their love experience with
               God. After man fell into sin, these reasons for marriage became
               even more urgent than before the Fall.
                  "The angels had cautioned Eve to beware of separating
               herself from her husband while occupied in their daily labor in the
               garden; with him she would be in less danger from temptation
               than if she were alone."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 53.
                  Fellowship and companionship were other divine reasons for
               the institution of marriage. Man was made a social being in God's
               image. Marriage is the highest fulfillment of the fellowship, and a
               model of all other human relations and fellowships. It is this fel-
               lowship, this communion, which is spoken of as becoming "one
               flesh." It is a oneness of heart, mind, soul, and body—a total
               union.
                  This togetherness, in which husband and wife complement
               each other and enrich each other, is also necessary for the practi-
               cal functions of marriage. God commissioned them to have do-
                minion over the earth and to keep and dress the garden. (See Gen.
                1:26-28; 2:15.) Strong marriages are still built around this
                cooperation between husbands and wives, which is all too often
                forgotten.
                   Finally, marriage was given as the foundation of sexual rela-
                tionships together with the procreation, care, and education of
                children.

                  What are some of the ingredients that make marriages work as
                they were intended by God? Eph. 5:21-33; Col. 3:18, 19.

    Part 2      "I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them
A SHADOW     if they abide even as I" (1 Cor. 7:8).
OF THINGS
TO COME?        Single persons are often made to feel inferior, guilty, or even
             abnormal. It is important to stress here that even though marriage
             was instituted by God—and is the one fellowship that serves as an
             illustration of the relation between Christ and the church—it is by
             no means the only way in which a person can find fulfillment in
             life.

              What are some of the reasons the Bible gives for persons to re-
             main unmarried? 1 Cor. 7:25, 26, 29-35; Matt. 19:10-12.

               Three reasons are given: a crisis situation, either personal or
             involving a larger group of people; the needs of the church in its
             missionary outreach into all the world; and the realization that the
             time of the end has come. Of course the apostle Paul is not urging
             people to remain unmarried, even though he wished that people
             would follow his example, because to him the single state seemed
             best for the work he had been called to do. But he exhorts the
             readers of his letter to consider his counsels carefully and then to
             select the course which seems best for their life, in their situation.

              Why will there be no marriage on the new earth? Matt. 22:30;
             Mark 12:25.

                The question has baffled many believers. They point out
             that marriage and the Sabbath were both instituted by God and
             given to man before they fell into sin. We do know that on the new
             earth people will keep the Sabbath to rest from their labor and to
             worship God (Isa. 66:22, 23). Then why does not marriage con-
             tinue? It is the author's view that marriage was given as a tempo-
             rary institution, much like the ritual of the earthly sanctuary.
             Both marriage and the earthly sanctuary are copies of a heavenly
             reality, an image of a divine model. But they are also shadows of
             realities to come. When the type meets its antitype, the shadow
             its real substance, they cease to exist. They are no longer
             needed. Could this be one reason why Jesus never married? We
             are not ever told in Scripture. But in Him the shadow and the real
             met. He was the perfect image of God. (See 2 Cor. 4:4; Col. 1:15;
             Heb. 1:3.) In His life the relationship with God and the partner-
             ship and solidarity with His fellow human beings had been
             fulfilled.

               How can we make preparations for that life on the new earth
             now, as married believers and as unmarried?

       Part 3 "Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands;
        AN that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be
 INSTRUMENT won by the conversation of the wives; while they behold your chaste
OF SALVATION conversation coupled with fear" (1 Peter 3:1, 2).

                  After the Fall marriage took on the added function of being a
                vehicle of salvation, an instrument of redemption. Says Paul:
                "The unbelieving husband is consecrated through his wife, and
                the unbelieving wife is consecrated through her husband" (1 Cor.
                7:14, RSV).

                  In what ways can marriage become an instrument of salvation to
                unbelievers? 1 Peter 3:1-7; Eph. 5:21-32; Titus 2:4, 5.

                  "From every Christian home a holy light should shine forth.
                Love should be revealed in action. It should flow out in all home
                intercourse, showing itself in thoughtful kindness, in gentle, un-
                selfish courtesy."—Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 144.
                  "The best test of the Christianity of a home is the type of
                character begotten by its influence. Actions speak louder than the
                most positive profession of godliness."—Patriarchs and Proph-
                ets, p. 579.

                  Following are three passages that counsel wives to be subject to
                their husbands. What is the meaning of them? Col. 3:18; 1 Peter
                3:1, 5; Eph. 5:22.

                   Three important aspects of this notion of submission should
                be noted: (1) Submission in the marriage relationship is a require-
                ment that applies to both partners. The apostle Paul says this in
                Ephesians 5:21, which constitutes the basis of his further counsel
                to husbands and wives: "Submitting yourselves one to another in
                the fear of God." (2) Submission on the part of both the husband
                and the wife is a voluntary act, born out of love and respect for
                the other. It cannot, and it should not, be required by law or as an
                institution. (3) Every act of submission to the spouse is done "out
                of reverence for Christ," "in the fear of God," "as it is fit in the
                Lord."
                   "It was not the design of God that the husband should have
                control, as head of the house, when he himself does not submit to
                Christ. He must be under the rule of Christ that he may represent
                the relation of Christ to the church. If he is a coarse, rough, bois-
                terous, egotistical, harsh, and overbearing man, let him never ut-
                 ter the word that the husband is the head of the wife, and that she
                 must submit to him."—The Adventist Home, p. 117.

     Part 4    "God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
 MARRIAGE     multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it" (Gen. 1:28).
AND FAMILY
                 Though clearly distinct from each other, marriage and family
              are closely linked together. One of the basic reasons for marriage
              is the procreation of children. Marriage constitutes thereby the
              basis of the family, where children are reared, habits are ac-
              quired, personalities are developed, love is learned, and children
              grow up to become full-fledged members of their society. Like
              marriage, the family is essential to human life, to the development
              of our personhood, and to the existence and continuity of human
              society.

                What function of marriage or the family did Jesus reaffirm in
              each of the following passages? John 2:1-11; Mark 7:10-13; Luke
              11:11-13.

                 Jesus put the weight of His whole authority behind the institu-
              tion of marriage and the family. He began His public ministry at a
              wedding feast and presented His teachings of the kingdom of God
              often in terms of human family relations. Jesus nowhere consid-
              ered one form of family life superior even preferable to another;
              neither do the prophets, the apostles, or the other writers of
              Scripture. Family forms are intimately related to the social and
              economic conditions and the cultural traditions in which people
              find themselves. In Israel, a tribal, agrarian society, the basic
              family form was the "father's house," which consisted of a hus-
              band and his wife, their sons families, and their grandchildren.
              Included in such a family were also the servants, who often called
              their masters "father." Besides this basic family unit there were
              other forms of family groupings, which included a whole village
              or a group of villages, a quarter of a city, or a whole territory.
              The term for family was even used loosely for all of Israel,
              much as we speak of the church as the family of God.

                 Are the scriptural forms of family life and organization required
              of people of other cultures and generations? If not, should we con-
              sider any form of family life and organization as the pattern for
              Christians in the whole world?

                 Two examples may bear upon the above: (1) the levirate mar-
              riage, the arrangement that a man marry his deceased brother's
              wife to raise up offspring for him (Deut. 25:5-10; Gen. 38:6-11),
              and (2) the mohar, a requirement that a man give a marriage
              present to the father of the bride (Gen. 34:12; Ex. 22:16; 1 Sam.
              18:25).

             A Christian View of Marriage                       9    Thursday
                                                                    August 26

    Part 5     What did Jesus teach about the indissolubility of the marriage
A LIFELONG   relationship?
     UNION
                "What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put
             asunder. . . . And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away
             his wife and marry another, committeth adultery against her. And
             if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another,
             she committeth adultery" (Mark 10:9-12).

               Jesus repudiated the Old Testament practice of putting away
             one's wife. And when the Pharisees defended that right on the
             part of the man—for the woman did not have such a right!—with
             the argument that Moses himself had given them the law regard-
             ing divorce (see Deut. 24:1-4), Jesus answered: "For your hard-
             ness of heart he wrote you this commandment" (Mark 10:5,
             RSV). But from the beginning marriage was intended for keeps
             (verses 6-9). It must be considered indissoluble until death sepa-
             rates the spouses. (See Rom. 7:1-3.)

               Does the Bible recognize exceptions to this rule? Matt. 5:31, 32;
             19:3-9; Deut. 24:1-4; 1 Cor. 7:10-16, 39.

                Scripture teaches the indissolubility of marriage for all believ-
             ers. Jesus Himself did so. This message seemed so harsh that
             His own disciples reacted to it with the words: "If such is the case
             of a man with his wife, it is not expedient to marry" (Matt. 19:10,
             RSV). Many disciples of Christ today are reacting the same way.
             Or they simply ignore the words of Christ. In Matthew 5:32 and
             19:9 it seems, however, as if Jesus Himself has given us an excep-
             tion by which divorce among believers is allowed, though not rec-
             ommended. Why that exception? And what does it mean?
                The word Jesus used to describe the "exception" is porneia,
             which may be translated as fornication or unchastity. Though
             fornication or unchastity (porneia) may include an adulterous re-
             lationship, it refers beyond that to continuous acts of sexual aber-
             ration and illicit sexual relationships, including homosexuality,
             pederasty, prostitution, incest, and other forms of sexual immo-
             rality. Some interpret Jesus' words in Matthew 5:32 and 19:9
             therefore not as an exception to the indissolubility of marriage but
              rather as an instruction to keep the marriage relationship pure.
             But, when, because of unchastity, the purity of the marriage rela-
              tionship has been polluted and defiled (see Heb. 13:4), it may not
              be possible to continue the relationship.

                Why did Jesus—and all the New Testament writers—insist on the
              indissolubility of marriage?

              A Christian View of Marriage                           9   Friday
                                                                      August 27

     Part 6      What counsel does Jesus offer us when the real situation in life
     A HEW    differs from the ideal?
BEGIRRING
 IN CHRIST      "Then came Peter unto him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my
              brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times? Jesus
              said unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until
              seventy times seven" (Matt. 18:21, 22).

                 Marriages are held together by love. One of the greatest expres-
              sions of this love is forgiveness, as Jesus' own example has
              shown us. In Him we all have received the forgiveness of our sins.
              And for that reason we should also forgive one another, be it ne-
              glect, harshness, anger, or even adultery. But of course forgive-
              ness does imply (on the part of the one to be forgiven) an attitude
              of contrition, a recognition of fault (guilt), and the intention to
              improve or make amends (to sin no more). When all of these are
              absent, the partner stands also before God as an "unbeliever." If
              such an "unbelieving" spouse wants to break up the marriage re-
              lationship, the apostle Paul says, "Let it be so; in such a case the
              brother or sister is not bound. For God has called us to peace"
              (1 Cor. 7:15, RSV). But we should all the time remember Jesus'
              words, "until seventy times seven," and those of the apostle
              Paul: "Wife, how do you know whether you will save your hus-
              band? Husband, how do you know whether you will save your
              wife?" (1 Cor. 7:16, RSV).

                How do thee principles apply to believers who have been di-
              vorced and remarried for other than biblical grounds and then seek
              readmission to the church? 2 Cor. 2:5-11; Col. 3:12, 13.

                 The love of Christ for the individual and the church knows no
              bounds. As the Lord has forgiven us, so we must also forgive.
              With regard to a different problem, Christ forgave the adulterous
              woman and told her to sin no more. But there was no condemna-
              tion for her! But the problem being considered here is more com-
              plex and enduring. (See John 8:3-11.) The nature of love does
              not change. At the same time, the love of Christ in the heart will
              give to Christian marriage a unique strength and stability. The
              church thus has an image and reputation to uphold. However, let
              us keep in mind that adultery or divorce and remarriage for other
              than biblical grounds, while grievous sins, are not in themselves
              the unpardonable sin. Gossip or slander may cause cruel heart-
              ache. But the undoubtedly better answer to all such problems
              would lie in better preparation for marriage in the first place.

                 How could local churches help strengthen the marriage relation-
              ships of the believers? How could they help those who have (had)
              difficulties in their marriage to find healing?

                                           Adult Lesson




The Church and
Human Needs
   "As ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Heal the
sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have re-
ceived, freely give" (Matt. 10:7, 8).

   Our world is ill, terribly ill. The symptoms of this illness are all
about us. About 65 percent of the world population is undernourished.
Some 20,000 people are starving to death daily. Many millions of people
are so malnourished that they are threatened with irreparable brain
damage. Poverty is robbing people of their dignity as human beings.
Oppression is rampant in many forms. There is terrible fear and frus-
tration. Because of political stress, wars, and economic hardships many
millions of people have been forced to leave their own country to live as
aliens and refugees in foreign lands, often under the most deplorable
conditions. What does all this have to do with being sent into all the
world to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ? Everything! All mission is
participation in the work of Jesus Christ. We have no mission of our
own. We imitate and continue the mission of our Lord, who announced
the aim of His mission as preaching "good news to the poor" and pro-
claiming "release to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to
set at liberty those who are oppressed" (Luke 4:18, RSV). Moved by
compassion, Jesus set out to heal the sick, to feed the hungry, to com-
fort the bereaved, to give new dignity to the poor and the social out-
casts. And though many of these acts were done as an evidence that the
kingdom of God had come and the dominion of the devil had been
broken, they were also plain works of compassion.
   Christ has sent His church into the world for exactly the same two
 reasons: to preach the coming of the kingdom of God which is at hand,
 and to do the works of compassion. These two are inextricably inter-
 twined. Proclamation with all prophetic powers and the deepest under-
 standing of truth means nothing without works of love and compassion.
 (See 1 Cor. 13:1-3.) The reverse is true also, however. Works of com-
 passion, assistance in human needs, must be accompanied by the clear
 message of the kingdom of God. It is a false concept of mission to think
 that works of compassion alone can bring about the restoration of the
 kingdom of God. True mission always includes a call to repent, to
 receive Christ as Lord and Saviour and to be joined to Him and to His
 church. But we should heed the apostle Paul's words: "Speak the truth
 in love."
                                                                           69

                                                                      August 29

     Part 1        What was Jesus' attitude toward those who were in need?
COMPASSION
                "When he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on
              them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep
              having no shepherd" (Matt. 9:36).

                 Our God is a compassionate God (Ex. 22:27; Ps. 116:5). When
              we suffer, He suffers with us. This is most dramatically ex-
              pressed in the incarnation: He became as one of us, to suffer with
              us. And because He Himself has suffered, He is able to help those
              who are suffering (Heb. 2:14-18), whether from sickness or op-
              pression, from hunger or loneliness, from weakness or poverty.
              Do we need to give any examples? Christ's whole life was charac-
              terized by compassion from the moment He saved a bridegroom
              from embarrassment for not having enough wine at the wedding
              (John 2:1-11) to the moment that He prayed in Gethsemane, "Not
              my will, but thine, be done" (Luke 22:42).

                Why is it important for the followers of Christ to be compassion-
              ate? Matt. 25:31-46; 18:33; Ps. 112:5.

                 Jesus Himself has made compassion His standard of judgment.
              Can there be anything more important in life? Note the words of
              the apostle John: "By this we know love, that he laid down his life
              for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. But if
              any one has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet
              closes his heart against Him, how does God's love abide in him?
              Little children, let us not love in word or speech but in deed and in
              truth" (1 John 3:16-18, RSV).

                 What relationship is there between faith and compassionate ac-
              tion that reflects the character of God? James 2:14-17; Luke 6:36.

                 There are two dangers the followers of Christ ought to avoid
              with regard to the relationship between faith and works of com-
              passion. The first is that one can exist without the other. As
              faith in Jesus is dead without works of love, so are also works of
              compassion meaningless without a faith in Jesus Christ. It is His
              love which moves us (2 Cor. 5:14). The second danger to avoid
              is to be selectively compassionate; that is, to do good to "our kind
              of people only," be they of the same church, kinship, class, or
              race. God's love knows no favorites! It embraces the whole world
              without distinction.

                 Is it possible to cultivate compassion? Where does true compas-
              sion have its origin?

  Part 2     What obligations do God's children have toward the poor?
POVERTY
             "The poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command
           thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to
           thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land" (Deut. 15:11).

             Concern for the poor is taught in the Scripture. The law of
           Moses commanded it (Ex. 22:25-27; Deut. 15:7, 8); the prophets
           have proclaimed it (Isa. 3:14, 15; Jer. 5:26-29; Eze. 16:49). Jesus
           Christ has taught it and exemplified it in His life (Luke 4:18,
           2 Cor. 8:9); and the early church practiced it (Acts 2:45; 4:32;
           11:27-30; 1 Cor. 16:1-3; Gal. 2:10). Failure to care for the poor
           was one of the sins that led Israel into captivity. That same fail-
           ure will also cause the ruin and condemnation of many at the end
           of time (Matt. 25:31-46).

             How does God regard the poor? James 2:1-6; Luke 1:51-53; 4:
           18, 19.

             Many have argued that riches by themselves are evil and that
           poverty is a virtue. But that is not so. The Bible calls Abra-
           ham's riches a blessing from the Lord (Gen. 24:35), and Paul
           teaches that God furnishes us with everything to enjoy (1 Tim.
           6:17). And poverty is a plague that was never wanted by God.
           To that end God set up laws in Israel to relieve His people of
           their poverty. And if people had obeyed God, there would have
           been no poor in Israel (Deut. 15:4-6). Poverty is a result of sin.
           Christ came to redeem us from sin's curse. No wonder that He
           has chosen the poor of this world to preach the good news to
           them.

             If riches of themselves are not wrong, what is the problem? Luke
           12:15-21; 1 Tim. 6:10.

             The dangers of riches are self-sufficiency, arrogance, and
           pride. Riches often make us forget God, who is the Giver of all
           wealth (Deut. 8:18), and we become callous toward those who are
           poor. In fact, the Bible says that riches often make people
           oppressors of the poor. But what we do to the least of God's crea-
           tures, we are in fact doing unto God. The rich stand condemned
           because they forgot God and did not recognize their dependence
           upon Him. No expression of piety, no form of religious belief or
           practice, can make up for neglecting the poor (Amos 5:11, 21-24;
           Mark 12:38-40). To practice piety without compassion is to be a
           hypocrite.

       Part 3        What particular promise did Jesus offer the poor?
THE POOR AND
THE KINGDOM       "He lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be ye
                poor: for yours is the kingdom of God" (Luke 6:20).

                   Many have interpreted these words of Christ in their spiritual
                meaning only. And of course these words should be read in light
                of Matthew 5:3, where Jesus says: "Blessed are the poor in spirit:
                for their's is the kingdom of heaven." But Luke did not leave out
                the words "in spirit" by accident or ignorance. He did mean "the
                poor." This literal meaning is supported by the accompanying
                woe: "Woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your con-
                solation" (verse 24). The blessing pronounced upon the poor
                agrees also with Jesus' words in Luke 4:18: "The Spirit of the
                Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gos-
                pel to the poor."

                  What is the condition upon which the poor may receive the bless-
                ings of the gospel? Matt. 5:3.

                   It is not poverty per se that prepares a person for the kingdom
                of God, but the recognition of one's own powerlessness and un-
                worthiness. Material poverty may be a help in that respect, but it
                is no guarantee of it. Conversely, a person may be blessed with
                many goods and yet recognize his own need and dependence
                upon God in everything. Zacchaeus was a very rich man, as
                were many other tax collectors in Jesus' day. Yet in his need for
                Christ and in his attitude toward his possessions, he showed in
                fact the true meaning of being poor in spirit. The rich man in
                Jesus' parable was not condemned because of his riches, but be-
                cause he considered them his "good things" (Luke 16:25). Laza-
                rus, the poor man, was not saved because he was poor, but be-
                cause he felt his need of God and depended on Him for
                everything. The rich may foolishly trust in their riches and
                therefore fail to enter into the kingdom of God. (See Mark 10:23,
                24; Luke 12:16-21.) But the poor can become so concerned about
                what they should eat or drink or how they should find clothing
                and shelter that they, too, forget God or betray a lack of faith in
                Him. To them the apostle says to cast all cares and anxieties
                upon God, "for he careth for you" (1 Peter 5:7).

                  In what way can the rich be poor and the poor be rich? 2 Cor.
                8:9; 6:10; 1 Cor. 1:5; Eph. 1:7.

                   How are God's promises to us in the gospel related to our respon-
                sibilities to the poor?

              fore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt" (Deut.
              10:18, 19).

                God is concerned about the aliens and refugees in the land. Not
              only do they share in the same needs as widows and orphans and
              other economically handicapped people, including the Levites
              (Deut. 12:12; 14:29), but foreigners are often socially powerless
              and therefore need an extra measure of love. Aliens and refugees
              are our neighbors in the very sense Jesus has given that term
              when He taught us to love our neighbor (Luke 10:25-37).
                 God gave Israel specific laws and social institutions to protect
              the foreigner from oppression and extortion, to give him at least a
              minimum basis of existence and to make him feel at home in the
              country in which he was living as an alien. Aliens, along with the
              poor, were entitled to the "second" harvest (Lev. 19:10; 23:22)
              and the triannual tithes (Deut. 14:28, 29). The alien also shared
              in the produce of the sabbath year (Lev. 25:6). They were enti-
              tled to the same protection, the same justice, and the same free-
              doms as the Israelite. But of course they also were to obey the
              same laws. And beyond all that, God told His people not to harm
              the aliens and refugees among them; He said that "the stranger
               who sojourns with you shall be to you as the native among you,
              and you shall love him as yourself" (Lev. 19:34, RSV).

                 Why would God's people be able to understand better the plight
              of the refugees and to help them than unbelievers? Ex. 23:9; Deut.
              24:17, 18. (See Heb. 11:13.)

                God's people themselves have been aliens and refugees in a for-
              eign land. They know what it means to be without rights and
              privileges, homeless and without support, ridiculed and op-
              pressed. In fact, it belongs to the very essence of the church that
              God's people live as strangers and sojourners in this world
              (1 Peter 1:17; 2:11). For this reason hospitality is a hallmark of
              God's people. We ought to welcome one another in the same way
              as Christ has welcomed us (Rom. 15:7) and to show hospitality to
              strangers, "for thereby some have entertained angels unawares"
              (Heb. 13:2). Jesus said: "I was a stranger and you welcomed
              me." "As you did it to one of the least of these my brethren, you
              did it to me" (Matt. 25:35, 40, RSV).

     Part 5     "Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wick-
OPPRESSION    edness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the opressed go free,
              and that ye break every yoke?" (Isa. 58:6).

                Scripture is full of warnings against oppression. And those who
              do oppress others are the enemies of God. He sent His Son into
              this world in particular "to set at liberty those who are op-
              pressed" (Luke 4:18, RSV).

                In what ways do people oppress others? Lev. 25:39; James 5:4;
              Luke 18:1-5; Isa. 1:21-23.

                 Christians frequently restrict the scope of evil to a narrow class
              of sins committed individually. However, sin rules in this world
              also in the form of evil structures, unjust laws, and bad institu-
              tions. Slavery is an example of such an institutionalized evil. And
              so is the nineteenth century factory system where 10-year-old
              children worked 12 to 16 hours a day. But, though we tend to rec-
              ognize the "sins of our fathers," all too little are we aware of the
              institutionalized evil in our own day. And much less are we in-
              clined to do something about it. Today we see, for example,
              oppression by powerful confederations, laws that give special
              privileges to the rich, systems that encourage bribery, structures
              that favor some classes or races of people over others, and mo-
              nopolies held by a few. The Bible not only warns us against
              individual sins, but also strongly condemns structural evil; and
              God urges His people to have nothing to do with it.

                What are some examples of structural evil the Bible warns
              against? Amos 2:6; 5:10-15; Isa. 5:8; 10:1-4; Ps. 94:20-23.

                 It was probably by some legal technicality that the needy could
              be sold "for a pair of shoes." The rich were able to take the
              poor person's land or sell him into slavery. By unjustly and self-
              ishly adding land to land and house to house and business to busi-
              ness, a few people gained control of a whole society, thereby rob-
              bing the majority of their social rights and economic freedoms.
              And this was all legal! But fraud and oppression of the poor are as
              sinful in God's eyes as sexual immorality or drunkenness. And if
              the system of justice is evil, then where can people turn for real
              justice? Social evil may be more subtle than personal evil, but it
              harms more people and is extremely displeasing to God.

                In Old Testament times God instituted certain laws to protect the
              poor and the oppressed. What can Christians do today to relieve
              people of social, economic, and structural oppression? (See Leviti-
              cus 25.)

     Part 6     "Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate
LONELINESS    and afflicted. The troubles of my heart are enlarged: 0 bring thou
              me out of my distress. Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and
              forgive all my sins" (Ps. 25:16-18).

                Of all the diseases of our time—social, economic, and phys-
              ical—loneliness is one of the greatest, if not the greatest. It is
              largely a result of the collapse of the traditional family systems
              and other primary groups, and the development of a mass society,
              especially in the cities. It is also rooted in modern man's loss of
              faith and the decline of religion. There can be no real fellowship
              among people without a fellowship with God for whom we were
              created.
                 What are some of the symptoms of this loneliness in modern
              society? Observers of modern society point in particular to the
              rapid increase of suicide, especially among the well-to-do, the
              well-educated, and professional people; the rise of drug abuse and
              alcoholism; the restlessness of modern man; the sharp increase in
              mental illnesses, stress; violence and crime; and pleasure seek-
              ing. Though poverty, hunger, unemployment, and oppression
              have something to do with these characteristics of our age, their
              real cause is loneliness.

                What can the church do to alleviate this problem of loneliness?
              James 1:27; 1 John 1:3, 7.

                 No other group in society is better prepared to help people in
              their loneliness than are the followers of Christ, who in fellowship
              with Him have also found fellowship with one another (Rom.
              12:5). And is not this the essence of religion, that we love God
              with all our heart and our might and our soul and our neighbor as
              ourselves? No club, no social organization, no party association,
              no society can accomplish what the church could do if it would
              accept its mission of visiting the lonely in their affliction. Did not
              Christ come into this world to reconcile those who had been es-
              tranged from God and from one another? And did not Christ send
              us into the world to unite men to God and to create a new commu-
              nion, a new fellowship, in which we all, without distinction, are
              each other's brother and sister?

                What is the relationship between evangelism, church growth,
              and fellowship? (See Eph. 4:15, 16.)

                Church growth is intimately related to fellowship. A recent re-
              port about church growth in North America expressed it this way:
              "The people were loved in."

  "Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things
which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's" (Matt.
22:21).

   From the very moment Christianity came into existence, it has
 been confronted with the question: How should the followers of Christ
 relate to the state and its various functions and to the civil authorities
 who are in charge? Each generation of believers must come to grips
 with this question in its own ways. And in each nation where the church
 has been planted or where the gospel of the kingdom is being pro-
claimed, Christians must find their own forms of relating to the state and
to the civil authorities. The relationship between the church and the
state cannot—and should not!—take the same form everywhere. What
seemed an appropriate way of relating to the state at one time may no
longer be suitable—or even possible—at another. Though the varying
circumstances in the world may demand different forms of relating to
the state, these forms must be solidly based on sound biblical principles.
   For our understanding of these biblical principles it is imperative
that we know of the circumstances in which the early Christians lived.
Christianity arose at a time when the state was at the same time a reli-
gious community. Although there was tolerance for other religions, def-
erence to the emperor was required on religious grounds. The rise of a
new religion such as Christianity was viewed as a direct threat against
the state. The early Christian church was a noninstitutional church
without property, power, or privileges—without schools, hospitals, or
elaborate organization. It was a lay movement. A relationship between
church and state as we know it now—namely, a relationship between
two different spheres of interest or power or organization—actually did
not exist. It was a relationship between the believers and the laws, insti-
tutions, customs, and authorities of the state in which they lived.
   The early Christians' attitude toward country, customs, culture,
and civil authorities was strongly influenced by their belief that the form
of this world was passing and that soon Christ would return to establish
His own kingdom of righteousness.

     Part 1     What is to be the Christian's attitude toward civil government?
SUBMISSION
                "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no
              power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God. Whoso-
              ever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God"
              (Rom. 13:1, 2).

                 No society can exist without some type of government and
              form of social control. For that reason every society has some
              form of government for the good of its members. The more
              complex these societies become, the more elaborate and perva-
              sive also the system of government has to become. It seeks to
              maintain order, to smooth relationships, to settle disputes be-
              tween people, to guarantee the functioning of institutions neces-
              sary for existence, to protect life, property, individual freedoms,
              and to promote the general welfare of society as a whole. For
              these reasons all people must obey civil authority and submit
              themselves to its law, orders, and regulations. However, Chris-
              tians go beyond that. Their attitude toward civil authority is not
              merely based on human logic and expediency; they submit to
              earthly rulers as unto the Lord. Revolt against government is re-
              bellion against God, who has instituted it and ordained it for the
              well-being of all. And rendering things unto Caesar that by divine
              ordinance belong to Caesar is religious duty and an expression of
              giving glory to God.

                What are some of the functions of government the Bible mentions
              specifically? Rom. 13:3, 7; 1 Peter 2:12-14.

                 Ideally, and in the divine plan for it, government exists for the
              good of its citizens. It accomplishes that in at least two ways: (1)
              by developing, encouraging, and stimulating organizations and in-
              stitutions that really contribute to the well-being of all; (2) by re-
              straining, suppressing, and even removing those orders and orga-
              nizations that have an evil influence on society or create divisions
              and disorder.

                Should Christians acively participate in these two functions of
              government? Give examples from Scripture to support your view.

                Some believers are of the opinion that members of the church
              should not be involved in government. They point to the danger
              of becoming contaminated by corruption and of being held re-
              sponsible for all actions. Others are of the opinion, however, that
              by involvement in government, Christians can influence society
              for good and contribute to the advance of the kingdom of God.

      Part 2   "Our commonwealth is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior,
       DUAL the Lord Jesus Christ" (Phil. 3:20, RSV).
CITIZEUSHIP
               Christians hold a dual citizenship—one in the kingdom of God,
             and the other in the nation in which they reside. But what does
             that mean? Some have seen in this dual citizenship an inherent
             conflict. Since God's kingdom is not of this world, they say,
             Christians can not actually live as citizens of both. (See John
             18:36.) They must choose between one or the other. Many
             other believers think, however, that the kingdom of God is not a
             place or a country outside of this present world. It rather is a
             sphere, an attitude, a life-style which permeates the whole life
             and thought and gives citizenship here its special meaning.
             They say the kingdom of God is within them. (See Luke 17:21.)
             What do you think?

              What are the meanings of the biblical term "kingdom of God"
             Mark 1:14, 15; Luke 10:8-11; 18:15-17.

                Contrary to most people's thinking in the time of Christ, the
             kingdom Jesus proclaimed was not a territory with visible struc-
             tures or institutions of power. Rather, the kingdom of God con-
             sists of the lordship of Christ in our lives, which is realized in our
             redemption and expressed in worship and in our obedience of His
             law. In this sense the kingdom of God is a reality on earth. This
             kingdom is not a new social order established apart from earthly
             societies and governments. It rather works in and through these
             earthly institutions. Christians, as citizens of the kingdom of God,
             are called to live out these principles of that kingdom within their
             citizenship on earth. Our citizenship in heaven, therefore, does
             not change our earthly citizenship. Rather, our citizenship on
             earth receives new meaning and direction as a result of our citi-
             zenship in heaven.

               When will these two citizenships become one? Matt. 25:31, 34;
             Rev. 7:9-12.

                With the coming of Jesus into this world, the kingdom of God
             has been established. And all who receive Him and accept Him as
             Lord and Saviour are citizens of that kingdom of God. At the
             same time, however, the full reign of Christ has not yet been es-
             tablished on this earth. Many people have never even heard of
             Him. And many others continue to reject Christ as Lord of their
             lives. At the second coming of Christ the kingdom will be initi-
             ated. It will be fully established at the close of the 1000 years.

     Part 3  "He said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things
       GOD which be Caesar's and unto God the things which be God's" (Luke
AND CAESAR 20:25).

                 God removes kings and sets up kings (Dan. 2:21). All things
              belong to Him, the earth and its fullness. All authority in heaven
              and on earth has been given to Christ (Matt. 28:18). There is no
              power without Him. Whether thrones or dominions or principal-
              ities or authorities—all things were created through Him and for
              Him (Col. 1:16). This testimony of Scripture should prevent us
              from a completely dualistic understanding of Jesus' words re-
              corded in Mark 12:17, Luke 20:25, and Matthew 22:21. The
              things which belong to Caesar and the things which belong to God
              are not two entirely separate entities, domains, or spheres of in-
              fluence. God is in ultimate control of everything. Our whole life
              belongs to Him—the government is instituted by God, and the
              authorities are ministers of God, attending to His interests (Rom.
              13:1-7).
                 Although separating the things which belong to Caesar from the
              things which belong to God, Jesus also emphasized the fact that in
              His kingdom the earthly and the heavenly belong together, under
              God. From this viewpoint—since the things belonging to Cae-
              sar actually belong to God—the government is a steward! Citi-
               zens of the kingdom of God pay taxes, tribute, revenues, and re-
               spect to earthly rulers, as unto God. Authorities are the servants
              of God.

                What attitude should Christians take, though, when civil au-
              thorities make requirements that conflict with God's requirements?
              Acts 5:29.

                 Sin has permeated every aspect of life on earth, every institu-
              tion, every structure. Government, though ordained by God, is
              no exception. It also is run by imperfect human beings and, like
              everything else, constantly influenced by powers of evil. Under
              these conditions it is unavoidable that at times governments issue
              rules and regulations or establish structures and organizations
              which are contrary to the principles of the kingdom of God. In
              such cases the followers of Christ should obey God rather than
              men.

                Can you think of some examples of legislation or of institutions
              which are in flagrant conflict with the Word of God and the princi-
              ples of His kingdom? Could Christians ever participate in acts of
              opposition to the government?

            The Christian and the State                     11 Wednesday
                                                              September 8

    Part 4   "Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's
  CHURCH sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; or unto governors, as
AND STATE unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and
           for the praise of them that do well" (1 Peter 2:13, 14).

               At this point the question must be raised: How do the counsels
            given by Christ regarding the Christian's attitude toward civil or-
            dinances and authority apply to the church as an institution in its
            relationship to the state? It is important that we notice a distinc-
            tion first. The New Testament Christian does not know about
            church-state relationships that developed after the death of the
            apostles. The counsels are addressed to the followers of Christ
            in their individual relationship to government, legal ordinances,
            and social institutions. The emphasis thereby is on good con-
            duct, submission, and the right attitude—never upon rights or
            privileges. But with the spread of the gospel and the christianiza-
            tion of many countries in the world, the church itself underwent
            some powerful changes. It began to acquire properties and to de-
            velop institutions of its own. It developed structures and organi-
            zation with its own government and entered into business, often
            big business. As a result, new forms of relationship developed be-
            tween the church and the state. These have given rise to great
            conflicts and powerful confrontations because that relationship is
            no longer one between individual believers and civil authorities,
            but between two institutions of considerable influence.

              What principles should guide the church as an institution in its
            relationship to the state? Titus 3:1; Matt. 22:21.

               In church-state relations we are confronted with areas of inter-
            est that may belong to both the church and the state—the educa-
            tion of children, for instance. As a social institution, the church
            must submit to the secular ordinances and laws which govern
            such institutions in the land. It may thank God if the state allows
            the church some special privileges (tax exemption, for instance),
            but the church should submit when the state exercises its legiti-
            mate authority over these institutional aspects of the church.
            Only when the state intrudes in what specifically belongs to the
            church such as the formulation and teaching of doctrines, the or-
            dination of its ministers, or the believers' relationship to God, the
            church may rightly protest. It is to meet such issues that the
            church has long maintained a Department of Public Affairs and
            Religious Liberty. Representation is also maintained at the
            United Nations and various national government centers.

              Why is separation of church and state the best policy with regard
           to potential conflicts between the two? What does separation of
           church and state really mean?

                                                              September 9

Part 5   "1 exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, in-
PEACE tercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; for kings,
       and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peace-
       able life in all godliness and honesty. For this is good and acceptable
       in the sight of God our Saviour" (1 Tim. 2:1-3).

            Christians are peacemakers. (See Matt. 5:9.) One way to make
         peace is through intercessory prayers for those who are in author-
         ity. Another is to live peaceably with all men (Rom. 12:18) and to
         work actively toward peace as a sign of the kingdom of God. (See
         Luke 10:5, 6.) This peace is not just an absence of war, though
         that is part of it. The peace Christians are urged to seek and to
         pursue for all men (Ps. 34:14) is the peace given to us by our Lord
         Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace (John 14:27). This peace
         should be established within the church itself and also pursued in
         the world.

           What attitude should prevail therefore among believers when
         conflicts do arise? Col. 3:15; 1 Cor. 6:1-8; Phil. 2:1-5.

           Though Christians do have a very positive attitude toward
         government, they nevertheless are urged not to seek arbitration
         outside of their communion of faith. A number of reasons are
         given. First, believers ought to be an example to the world—
         examples of peace, fellowship, and love. If society cannot see
         these exemplified in the church, then where would they find such
         a model? Second, government agencies are definitely of a lower
         order than the church. The apostle speaks of the "unrighteous"
         (1 Cor. 6:1, RSV), "unjust" (KJV), and of those who are "least
         esteemed by the church" (6:4). Third, it puts the whole church
         to shame if we cannot find persons wise enough in the church to
         decide between members who have conflicts with each other (6:5,
         6). It actually is a defeat for the gospel. Finally, Christians have
         to learn to have the mind of Christ, in humility counting others
         better than themselves, having other people's interest in mind,
         suffering wrong and being defrauded rather than to be wrong
         themselves (6:7-9). The church ought to set an example to the
         government and to society as a whole, rather than turn to them for
         justice.

            In what ways can Christians best promote peace? Rom 12:16-20;
          1 Peter 3:8-10.

            We ought to realize that a separation of church and state does
          not mean a separation of religion from life. Who would be able to
          pursue peace better than the followers of Christ?

      Part 6     "He said unto them, the kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship
RESPECT AND    over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called
    CAUTION    benefactors. But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among
               you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth
               serve" (Luke 22:25, 26).

                  Earthly governments are not an acceptable model for church
               organization. In the first place, earthly governments are built on
               power, whether by contract or by absorption. Second, the Chris-
               tian concept of leadership is centered in Jesus Christ, whose king-
               dom is not of this earth. His leadership was characterized by
               voluntary submission, humility, and service (servanthood).

                 What was Jesus' reaction to the report that an evil king would kill
               Him? Luke 13:31, 32.

                 The Bible portrays both respect and caution in its attitude
               toward government. On the one hand, we are urged to subject
               ourselves to its authority because it has been instituted by God
               and to pray for the earthly rulers. On the other hand, the Bible
               also speaks of those earthly rulers as "unrighteous" (1 Cor. 6:1,
               RSV), as "least esteemed by the church" (1 Cor. 6:4, RSV), as
               outright evil, and as persecutors of the righteous (Revelation 13
               through 18). The book of Revelation portrays symbols of many
               such evil rulers. Jesus Himself called King Herod, who was head
               of the Jewish government at His time, "that fox" (Luke 13:31,
               32). In fact, Jesus told the Pharisees to "go and tell that fox" that
               He would continue with His work until He had finished it. That
               sounds like a revolutionary attitude. However, Jesus was not a
               revolutionary! He kept a balance between the demands of the
               kingdom of God and the ordinances of this world. He rebuked
               evildoers and criticized evil practices; yet He submitted Himself
               voluntarily to them.

                 How can the church become more active in promoting peace and
               prosperity in the nation and in the world?

                 "In conformity to the divine requirements there is a transform-
               ing power that brings peace and good will among men. If the
               teachings of God's word were made the controlling influence in
               the life of every man and woman, if mind and heart were brought
               under its restraining power, the evils that now exist in national
               and in social life would find no place."—Prophets and Kings, p.
               192.

  "I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand,
and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of
the Gentiles" (Isa. 42:6).

   The aim of this quarter's lessons has been to deepen our under-
standing of the relationship between the Christian and the world and to
discover anew the biblical principles that should guide us in that rela-
tionship. It has become obvious by now that this relationship has many
different forms and facets which are also constantly changing. This
makes it necessary for every generation of believers, in every country
and culture, to discover for themselves how to apply the biblical princi-
ples to their particular situation.
   It has become evident, further, that these biblical principles are based
on two premises. The first is that the whole world lies in the power of
sin and that everything in this world is affected by its evil influence.
Therefore, Christians should shun this world, that is, its corruption,
wickedness, and association with evil. The other basic premise is that
God loves this world. Out of love He created it and endowed it with
riches, beauty, energies, and wonderful things for people to enjoy. Out
of love God is actively at work in this world (John 5:17) to save it and to
 restore it so that it can fulfill the purpose for which it was made.
    Perhaps no other biblical image describes this twofold attitude toward
 the world better than that of light. It views the world as darkness and
 the church as light. This stresses on the one hand the radical differ-
 ence between the church and the world, "for . . . what fellowship has
 light with darkness? What accord has Christ with Belial? Or what has a
 believer in common with an unbeliever?" (2 Cor. 6:14, 15, RSV). On the
 other hand, the image of light also emphasizes its role of shining to scat-
 ter darkness and the need of light in a dark place (Matt. 5:14-16). Light
 and darkness are opposites, and in God's plan of salvation the light must
 be brought where the darkness exists. Participation in the work of
 Christ, who is the True Light (John 1:9; 1 John 2:8), is a life of wit-
 nessing to that Light in a world that lies in darkness.


                                                                     83
               A Light to the World                               12   Sunday
                                                                  September 12

      Part 1      "This then is the message which we have heard of him, and de-
GOD IS LIGHT   dare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all"
               (1 John 1:5).

                  In the Bible the words "light" and "darkness" are often used
               figuratively. When we read that "God is light, and in him is no
               darkness at all," we understand this to mean that God is alto-
               gether good, without a trace of evil. Yet this is only one meaning
               of the word "light" as used in the Bible to apply to God. We need
               to consider also the other meanings in order to understand more
               fully the biblical message that God is light. This is the more im-
               portant, since Scripture calls the followers of God "children of
               light," who are sent by God into the world to let His light shine.

                 What are some of the other meanings of "light" in the Bible as it
               applies to the work and the character of God? Ps. 27:1; 2 Cor.
               4:6, 7; Isa. 60:1-3.

                  There are more than 20 different meanings found in Scrip-
               ture. The ones that stand out most prominently are these: salva-
               tion, truth, righteousness, goodness, glory, power, life, knowl-
               edge, help, comfort, joy. Notice how real and tangible these are.
               Light, in Scripture, is a real experience, a tangible reality, much
               as is the physical light. One notices when it is there or when it is
               absent.

                 What is the relationship between God and physical light? Gen.
               1:2-5; Rev. 22:5.

                  Without God there is no light. Even what we know as "day and
               night," which seem so natural to us, would not exist without
               God's creative and sustaining power. And since life depends on
               light, this world would not exist without the grace of God.

                  How does God's light continue to shine in this world? Matt. 5:16;
               1 John 2:9-11; Phil. 2:14, 15.

                  "If we wish to direct others in the path of righteousness, the
               principles of righteousness must be enshrined in our own hearts.
               Our profession of faith may proclaim the theory of religion, but it
               is our practical piety that holds forth the word of truth. The con-
               sistent life, the holy conversation, the unswerving integrity, the
               active, benevolent spirit, the godly example,—these are the medi-
               ums through which light is conveyed to the world."—The Desire

   Part 2     "Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the
MST, THE    world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall
WE LIGHT    have the light of life" (John 8:12).

               The Scriptures testify that Jesus is light (John 1:9). By Jesus'
            claim that He is light He emphasizes not only His divinity and His
            oneness with God but also the authenticity of His life and work,
            the absolute truth of all His words.

               Note the context of these passages in which Jesus declares that He
            is the light of the world. John 8:12; 9:5.

              "The world has had its great teachers, men of giant intellect
            and wonderful research, men whose utterances have stimulated
            thought, and opened to view vast fields of knowledge; and these
            men have been honored as guides and benefactors of their race.
            But there is One who stands higher than they. . . . We can trace
            the line of the world's great teachers as far back as human records
            extend; but the Light was before them. As the moon and the stars
            [planets] of the solar system shine by the reflected light of the sun,
            so, as far as their teaching is true, do the world's great thinkers
            reflect the rays of the Sun of Righteousness. Every gem of
            thought, every flash of intellect, is from the Light of the
            world."—The Desire of Ages, pp. 464, 465.

              What is the deepest meaning of the biblical testimony that Jesus is
            the "light"? Isa. 49:6; Luke 2:32; John 12:46.

              The term "light of the world" has a great many meanings in
            Scripture: truth, life, knowledge, etc. However, the central
            meaning of Jesus as the light is that He is the Messiah, the One
            sent by God to reconcile human beings to Himself and to each
            other, the One in whom the whole world, lost in sin, may find
            salvation.

             How did Jesus show by His life and words that He was indeed the
            Messiah, the Light of the world? Luke 4:16-21; 19:10.

               Of the miracles Jesus performed, one of the most striking was
             His opening of the eyes of the blind. (See Mark 8:22-26; 10:46-52.)
             We all are blind, groping about in darkness as a result of sin. If we
             let Jesus open our eyes, darkness will cease. But if we reject His
             healing, we shall remain in darkness forever.

               Has Jesus opened my eyes and dispelled the darkness of my life?
             In what ways?

OF THE WORLD
                   "Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be
                 hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on
                 a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house"
                 (Matt. 5:14, 15).

                   These words of Christ summarize the calling and mission of
                 the church in the world. What a miracle of grace! For who of us,
                 by nature, is a light? To be a light is, in the words of the apostle
                 John, to love our neighbor (1 John 2:7-11). Other passages of
                 Scripture identify the light as doing the truth (John 3:20, 21), hav-
                 ing the mind of Jesus Christ, and walking blameless before God
                 (Phil. 2:5-15).

                   What difference is there between Jesus as the light of the world,
                 and the light of the world as it applies to the followers of Christ?
                 John 1:6-8; 2 Cor. 4:5-7.

                    As our moon and the planets in our solar system have no light in
                 themselves but reflect only the light of the sun, so it is with the
                 followers of Christ. They are not the light by themselves, but
                 they are called to reflect the True Light, Jesus Christ. We have
                 no light in ourselves. But we can bear witness to the Light. And
                 even bearing witness to the Light is not our own work, but it is
                 God Himself "who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the
                 knowledge of the glory of God" (2 Cor. 4:6, RSV). Without Him
                 we "can do nothing" (John 15:5). It is God who works in us "both
                 to will and to work for his good pleasure" (Phil. 2:13, RSV).

                   What is the only way, therefore, by which the followers of Christ
                 can be the light of the world? John 12:36.

                   Christians do most of the wholesome and helpful things com-
                 mon to society as a whole. It is in the permeating influence of the
                 love of God, through grace, touching every aspect of life that the
                 Christian sheds Heaven's light on the world. This is the differ-
                 ence between the church and the world.

                   How can I let my light shine in the environment where God has
                 placed me?

    Part 4     What is the aim of bearing witness in the world as Christ's light
0 GLORIFY    bearers?
     GOD
               "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good
             works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" (Matt. 5:16).
             (See also John 15:7, 8.)

               Whether the symbol used is light shining or fruit bearing, the
             object is to glorify God. All too little attention have we given to
             God's purpose for our calling in this world. Usually we think of
             the aim of mission as proclaiming the Word of God, helping peo-
             ple to accept Christ, planting and building up churches, and serv-
             ing humanity in its deepest needs. And all of these are indeed rea-
             sons for the Christian to be in the world. Yet the main aim of our
             whole life and work in the world is to glorify God. It is for the
             glory of God that we were made (Isa. 43:7). Christ Himself came
             into this world to glorify God (John 17:4). For the same purpose
             He also sends us into the world (2 Thess. 1:11, 12), so that even
             those who in the past have been ignorant of the promises of God
             may now glorify Him.

               In each of the following passages, how is God said to be glorified?
             Connect the answers with Revelation 14:7. Isa 49:3-6; Matt. 15:31;
             Acts 13:47, 48; 2 Cor. 9:13.

               The Bible tells us that when the crowds saw the sick and crip-
             pled people healed, they glorified the God of Israel (Matt. 15:31).
             (See also Matt. 9:8; Mark 2:12; Luke 5:25, 26; 13:13; Acts 4:21.)
             Other ways by which we are called to glorify God are the preach-
             ing of the gospel and sharing God's promises with those who do
             not know Him (Acts 13:48), ministry through our God-given gifts
             (1 Peter 4:9-11), offering praises (Ps. 50:23), dying for the sake of
             God and His work (John 21:19), healthful habits and cleanliness
             of our body (1 Cor. 6:19, 20), Christian obedience, stewardship,
             and liberality in giving (2 Cor. 9:13). It is noteworthy that the
             Scriptures emphasize works as a way to glorify God. But all of
             these works must, of course, be rooted in faith and love. Paul
             wrote: "If I give away all I have, and if I deliver my body to be
             burned, but have not love, I gain nothing" (1 Cor. 13:3, RSV). As
             faith is dead without works (James 2:17), works by themselves
             mean nothing either. But born out of faith and rooted in love,
             these works glorify God and lead many others to worship Him.

               How, then, can Revelation 14:6, 7 best be fulfilled in our world
             today?

            A Light to the World                               12    Thursday
                                                                 September 16

    Part 5  "In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light
LIGHT AND shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not" (John
DARKNESS 1:4, 5).

               In the same way as the Bible often uses the word "light" to
            denote goodness, salvation, righteousness, truth, knowledge, or
            life, so does darkness in Scripture stand for evil, lostness, igno-
            rance, falsehood, error, or death. As light stands for the presence
            of God, so darkness denotes the absence of God.

              What is the meaning of the words "and the darkness compre-
            hended it [the light] not" (John 1:5)?

               Various explanations have been offered. Some maintain that
            sinful man did not understand the life and the work of Christ be-
            cause his mind is darkened (Rom. 1:21). Others insist that we first
            have to live in the light in order to understand the .gospel (John
            3:21). Still others emphasize that the text should be translated:
            "And the darkness has not overcome the light." The Greek
            word used in the text is more frequently translated this way in
            Scripture. Indeed, even through the powers of evil seem trium-
            phant in this world, the message of the gospel is that Jesus has
            overcome the world, goodness has triumphed over evil, life over
            death (2 Cor. 2:14; Col. 2:15). Christ is head over all things, far
            above all rule, authority, power, and dominion (Eph. 1:20-23).
            Another group of interpreters maintains that the text means that
            people, though estranged from God, have indeed understood the
            meaning of the gospel, but they have in pride rejected it. They
            have clearly heard Jesus cry out: "He who believes in me, be-
            lieves not in me but in him who sent me. And he who sees me sees
            him who sent me. I have come as light into the world, that who-
            ever believes in me may not remain in darkness. . . . He who re-
            jects me and does not receive my sayings has a judge; the word
            that I have spoken will be his judge on the last day" (John 12:
            44-48, RSV). But they have chosen darkness over light.
               Each of these interpretations stresses an important aspect of
            the biblical message of salvation and of the work of mission.
            Without the work of Christ, through His Spirit, no one can under-
            stand the depth of God's grace and the meaning of His work for
            us. Without His power we cannot accept it. But those who are
            willing to give up their own ideas, will, and habits will see the light
            clearly and find in it the way, the truth, and the life.

              Is it possible to walk in light and in darkness at the same time?
            (See Matt. 6:23, 24; Luke 11:35.) What would be the hallmark of
            such a believer or of such a church? (See Rev. 3:15-18.)

    Part 6     What is God's will for all humanity?
E LIGHT OF
SALVATION      "This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour: who
             will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the
             truth" (1 Tim. 2:3, 4).

               God wants all humanity to be saved. To that end He sent His
             Son into the world to enlighten everyone, so that whoever seizes
             that light and accepts Jesus as his Lord and Saviour shall be
             saved.

               How does God accomplish His work of salvation in the world to-
             day? John 6:44; 1 Peter 2:9, 10; Col. 1:12, 14.

                No one can be saved by his own power or because of his own
             will. Thanks be to our God, who Himself is constantly at work
             to draw people unto Himself, to call them out of darkness into His
             marvelous light, to uphold them in their struggles, and to build
             them up in the faith.It is God who by His spirit is calling us to be
             members of His own household as sons and daughters of God
             (Rom. 8:14-17).

               How can we, having once accepted the light, remain in it? Rom.
             13:12-14; Eph. 5:8-17; 1 John 1:7-10.

               Salvation is God's free gift to all people. Whether we remain in
             the light as heirs and children of the light depends to a large extent
             on our determination to walk in the light. What does that mean?
             Three aspects stand out clearly. First, to cast off darkness.
             That is, to give up all those habits, thoughts, and interests
             which detract from our walk with God. (See Eph. 4:22, 25; 1 Peter
             2:1). Second, to walk in the light. That is, to choose to do good
             and to love one's neighbor, and thus glorify God. Third, to put
             on the armor of light. This armor of light is designed to protect
             the believers from the attacks of the evil one and to make it possi-
             ble for the followers of Christ to use the weapons of their spiritual
             warfare to overcome the darkness and to penetrate it. The parts
             of this armor are truth, righteousness, peace, faith, salvation, and
             the sure word of God (Eph. 6:11-18).

                In what ways can Christians really become the light of the world?

               "Every soul is to be a bright and shining light, showing forth
             the praises of Him who has called us out of darkness into His mar-
             velous light.'We are laborers together with God.' "—Christian

  "By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country,
dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the
same promise: for he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose
builder and maker is God" (Heb. 11:9, 10).

   Great men and women of faith have always regarded this world and
everything in it as transitory. Our real home is that world where God
dwells in the midst of His people, where there is no more mourning,
fear, pain, sin, or death (Rev. 21:1-4). Notice that our real home is not
heaven, but a new earth!
   Although God's people have expected the arrival of this new earth
since God's promise of salvation to our first ancestors, nevertheless
there have been four periods in the history of humanity when this ex-
pectation was of universal dimension. The first period was the time of
the prophets Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel, who announced the resto-
ration of the people of Judah to their homeland which would become the
center to which the nations would flock and find salvation.
   The second period of universal messianic expectation was the time
of the birth of Christ. Inside as well as outside the JeWish nation there
were prophets foretelling the arrival of the Messiah. Says Ellen White:
"Outside of the Jewish nation there were men who foretold the appear-
ance of a divine instructor. These men were seeking for truth, and to
them the Spirit of Inspiration was imparted."—The Desire of Ages, p.
33.
   The third period was the time of the 1820s through the early 1840s
when again all over the world people arose foretelling the restoration of
all things.
   Finally, in our day we see everywhere the rise of numerous reli-
gious movements which find their creative center in the expectation of a
new heaven and a new earth. Let us now, more than ever before, be-
come aware of these signs pointing to the fullness of our time and pre-
pare ourselves, and the millions of others living in the expectation of a
new heaven and a new earth, for this most glorious event of all times—
the restoration of the kingdom of God.

   Part 1   "And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that
FULLNESS    doeth the will of God abideth forever" (1 John 2:17).
 OF TIME
               "The world passeth away." In this world everything is tran-
            sitory; nothing is permanent. So why be so foolish as to put one's
            trust in the things of the world, its forms and fashions, its wisdom
            and beauty? All these things are passing away (1 Cor. 7:31). All
            life is like grass, and all its glory like the flower of grass. The
            grass withers and the flower falls. Only the word of the Lord
            abides forever (1 Peter 1:24, 25). (See also Matt. 6:25-33.) But it is
            not just the civilization on this world that is passing; the world
            itself will be radically altered.

              What does Scripture tell us about the time of the end of this
            world? Dan. 2:31-45; 12:1-7.

              "Surely the Lord God does nothing, without revealing his se-
            cret to his servants the prophets" (Amos 3:7, RSV). God has in-
            deed revealed that this world of ours will come to an end. The
            Bible speaks repeatedly about a "fullness of time," a period in
            history when certain prophecies regarding special events in the
            program of God's salvation were being fulfilled. The apostle
            Paul says that when a certain time had been fulfilled, God sent
            forth His Son (Gal. 4:4). Jesus Himself said: "The time is
            fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand" (Mark 1:15). Many
            interpreters of Scripture have in particular pointed to the proph-
            ecy of Daniel 9:24-27 concerning the "seventy weeks of years"
            (RSV) in which 69 weeks or 483 years were set aside for God's
            people until the coming of the Messiah. He would then finish the
            transgression, put an end to sin, make atonement for iniquity, and
            bring in everlasting righteousness (see the diagram). In a similar
            way, the Bible has also given us some clear time indicators con-
            cerning the end of the world when Christ will come a second time:

       Part 2     What signs confirm that we are indeed living in the last days of
   THE SIGHS    this world's history?
OF THE TIMES
                  "Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:
                and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in
                divers places."
                  "And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.
                And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax
                cold" (Matt. 24:7, 11, 12).

                  The events characterizing our world today may not by them-
                selves convince many people that we are living at the very end of
                time. But to those who accept Christ and who know His Word,
                these events constitute the clearest signs of the end of our world:
                the terrible famines; the disastrous earthquakes; the floods,
                droughts, and atmospheric disturbances; the rise of occultism and
                of hundreds of false messiahs. Not only are these signs clearer
                and more frequent than at the time when we first believed (Rom.
                13:11), now they are also truly universal.

                   Besides the signs specifically mentioned by Christ in Matthew
                24:3-31 and in Luke 21:7-28, what are some other signs mentioned
                in Scripture? 2 Tim. 3:1-5; James 5:1-5; 2 Peter 3:1-6.

                   The facts themselves are not in dispute. Scholars from every
                discipline recognize that our age is an age of crisis—crises in soci-
                ety and in the economy, in law and in governent, in relations be-
                tween people and nations. As one scientist expressed it so power-
                fully: "We are racing toward catastrophe on several separate but
                related routes."—Geoffrey Abert, After the Crash: How to Sur-
                vive and Prosper During the Depression of the 1980s (New York:
                New American Library, Signet Books, 1979), p. 29. But what do
                these events really mean, besides creating fear and distress such
                as people have never experienced before? In the light of the sure
                word of prophecy we know that when we see all these things,
                "the end of all things is at hand" (1 Peter 4:7).

                   In light of the clarity and the universality of these signs of the time
                of the end, what should be our attitude? What kind of persons
                should we be? How should we conduct our lives? Rom. 13:11-14;
                1 Thess. 5:1-11; 2 Peter 3:11, 14.

                   What preparation have you made to prepare yourself, your fam-
                ily, and friends, as well as the people with whom you associate daily,
                to be ready to stand before the Son of man?

    Part 3   "This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for
 E GOSPEL a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come" (Matt.
  IS BEING 24:14).
OCLAIMED
             The proclamation of the gospel of the kingdom throughout
           the whole world is a divine commission, a test of the true church,
           and the breath by which the church lives and moves and has its
           existence (Matt. 28:19, 20). But it is also God's way of leading the
           history of this world to its end and of ushering in His kingdom. As
           such, the proclamation of the gospel of the kingdom is a sign both
           of the certainty of the promise of God and of its fulfillment in our
           time.

              What does Scripture mean by the "gospel of the kingdom"?
             Mark 1:14, 15; 2 Cor. 5:18-20.

                The kingdom of God was the central theme of Jesus' own
             preaching. It also ought to be the starting point of our proclama-
             tion and of our mission, for we are His ambassadors. We have no
             other gospel but the gospel of the kingdom. And we have no other
             mission but to proclaim the arrival of that kingdom. But what
             does it all mean? From Jesus' own words and the writings of the
             apostles, the following elements stand out clearly: (1) It is the
             proclamation of the truth as it is in Jesus Christ, who Himself is
             the truth (John 14:6). (2) This proclamation urges people to put
             their faith in Him and be saved. (3) It is also a call to repentance
             and to a changed life in the power of the Holy Spirit. (4) The
             gospel of the kingdom is a message of peace and of reconciliation;
             it is at the same time also a work of judgment. In fact, it is through
             the proclamation of the gospel that people are saved or con-
             demned (John 3:16-18). (5) The proclamation of the gospel of
             the kingdom is also a work of healing and liberation. Poor people
             receive new dignity; the unemployed are enabled to help them-
             selves; the hungry are fed; the sick are healed; the lonely are vis-
              ited; the afflicted are helped in their distress (Luke 4:18-21). (6)
              Proclamation means word and deed; it is accomplished through
              presentation and manifestation.

               What means has Heaven provided so that this gospel of the king-
             dom can be preached in all the world in this generation? Matt.
             28:18-20; Acts 4:7-13; John 16:7-11.

               All power in heaven and on earth is given to Christ. Through
             the Holy Spirit, bringing us that power, He sends us into the
             world.

      Part 4        What will be the greatest event at the end of time?
THE COMMG
  OF CHRIST       "The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with
               the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead
               in Christ shall rise first: then we which are alive and remain shall be
               caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the
               air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord" (1 Thess. 4:16, 17).

                 The last day of the world's history is the day of our Lord Je-
               sus Christ (1 Cor. 1:8), the day when the whole world will see
               "the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory"
               (Luke 21:27). This will be the most glorious event of all times.
               Every eye will see Him, even the people who pierced Him (Rev.
               1:7). There will be nothing secret about it. People will see
               Him—and His myriads of angels—and hear the shouts of com-
               mand and the summons of the trumpet. (See Matt. 24:31; 1 Cor.
               15:51, 52.) However, that "great day" (Rev. 6:17) will not have
               the same meaning to everyone. To many it will be a "day of
               redemption" (Eph. 4:30), the day they have been hoping for,
               longing for, living for, praying for. To many others, however, it
               will be a day of dread, fear, and terror, as is obvious from their
               shouts to the mountains to fall on them and to the hills to cover
               them (Rev. 6:16, 17). Let us therefore choose now to which group
               we want to belong.

                 What events will take place at the second coming of Christ?
               1 Thess. 4:13-18; 1 Cor. 15:22-25; 2 Thess. 1:5-12.

                  Five events are clearly mentioned in Scripture: (1) Those
               who have loved His appearance and have expected Him "shall be
               changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last
               trump" (I Cor. 15:51, 52). (2) Those who died in Christ will be
               "raised imperishable" (1 Cor. 15:52, RSV) in the first resurrec-
               tion. (3) Those who have loved the Lord and have remained
               faithful to His Word and who are alive at His coming will, with the
               resurrected saints, be taken up into the air to meet the Lord, to be
               with Him (1 Thess. 4:17) and to reign with Him as priests a
               thousand years (Rev. 20:6). (4) The living unbelievers, how-
               ever, will be slain by Christ when He "shall be revealed from
               heaven with His mighty angels" (2 Thess. 1:7). (5) Those un-
               believers who will have died before the second coming of Christ
               will not be raised, but remain in their graves until the thousand
               years will have ended (Rev. 20:4, 5).

                 What difference does it make in my life to know that Jesus is com-
               ing soon?

                                                              September 23

  Part 5    What will be the situation on earth during the second coming of
HOUSARD    Christ?
  YEARS
             "The heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and
           every mountain and island were moved out of their places. And the
           kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the
           chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every
           free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the moun-
           tains" (Rev. 6:14, 15).

             "Desolate! Desolation and ruin!" (Nahum 2:10, RSV). This
           picture of plundered Nineveh is perhaps the best description of
           the situation on earth during the second coming of Christ. Peter
           states that "the elements will be dissolved with fire, and the earth
           and the works that are upon it will be burned up" (2 Peter 3:10,
           RSV). The Old Testament prophets, in describing events of
           their day, foretell the conditions at the great day of the Lord. "In
           the fire of his jealous wrath, all the earth shall be consumed; for a
           full, yea, sudden end he will make of all inhabitants of the earth"
           (Zeph. 1:18, RSV). (See also Isa. 24:6, 19, RSV). Yet this utter
           destruction of all life on earth is not the final word. The prophet
           Isaiah knows that "after many days" the earth will be restored.
           (This will be after the passage of the thousand-year period of
           Revelation 20:3-7.)

             What events will take place during this period of desolation on
           earth? Rev. 20:4-6; 1 Cor. 6:2, 3.

             While the earth is "waste and void," "its cities . . . laid in
           ruins" (Jer. 4:23-26), its inhabitants destroyed, and the devil
           bound and thrown into a pit (Rev. 20:1-3), the saints are being
           given thrones on which to rule with Christ as priests for a thou-
           sand years (Rev.20:4-6). The Bible describes this reigning of the
           saints in particular as a work of judgment (Rev. 20:4). As the
           apostle Paul says: "Do you not know that we are to judge an-
           gels?" (1 Cor. 6:3, RSV). That judgment really belongs to
           Christ (John 5:22), but He has chosen to commit that judgment
           together with His saints. Those who have been persecuted, tor-
           tured, and killed for their faith in God and their testimony of Jesus
           will now sit in judgment over their persecutors, torturers, and
           murderers. The ones who suffered from the evil work of fallen
           angels, principalities, and powers will now judge them. The
           saints are receiving the kingdom, and with that reign they also
           judge. (See Dan. 7:10, 18, 22, 26, 27.)

              What happens at the end of the thousand years? Rev. 20:7-14.

       Part 6      "I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the
A NEW HEAVEN    first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea. And I
   AND A NEW    John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out
       EARTH    of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband" (Rev.
                21:1, 2).

                  Out of the terrible desolation and ruin of the old earth there
                arises "a new heaven and a new earth." What a difference be-
                tween these two worlds! The first lies in the power of the evil
                one (1 John 5:19, RSV). "None is righteous, no not one; no one
                understands, no one seeks for God." "The way of peace they
                do not know" (Rom.3:10, 11, 17, RSV). But the new heaven and
                the new earth we are looking for, according to God's promise, is
                full of righteousness, peace, and happiness. (See 2 Peter 3:13.)
                God Himself will remove all the results of sin and will dwell with
                us.

                  What does the Bible tell us concerning life on this new earth? Isa.
                65:17-25; 66:22, 23; Rev. 21:3, 4; 22:1-5.

                  Holy men and women of God, at various times, have tried to
                paint a picture of life on the new earth. But can any mortal really
                understand what God in His wisdom and mercy has prepared for
                those who love Him? We do read of joy, feasting, and eternal hap-
                piness; of work and of worship; of music and of living together in
                genuine fellowship. But all we can say with certainty is that
                "what no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man con-
                ceived," has God "prepared for those who love him" (1 Cor. 2:9,
                RSV). The apostle Paul once told of "a man in Christ" who was
                caught up into Paradise. But the things he heard and saw and ex-
                perienced there could not be told. He was unable to describe
                them (2 Cor. 12:1-4).

                 What will be the hallmark of the relationship between God and
                man on the new earth? Rev. 21:2, 3, 9; 22:4, 17.

                  "They shall be his people," a relationship also described as a
                marriage. We, as a unit in the New Jerusalem, are the bride.
                Christ is the Bridegroom, who has presented "the church to him-
                self in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that
                she might be holy and without blemish" (Eph. 5:27, RSV). As His
                bride, we shall also bear His name, a name of love, "for God is
                love" (1 John 4:8).

                  What guarantee do we have that sin and rebellion will not rise
                again in this new earth? (See Nahum 1:9; Heb. 10:10-12.)
